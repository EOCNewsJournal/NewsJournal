The contract includes the supply of the systems over a period of one year for an initial contract value of more than EUR 16 million and the servicing and maintenance of the systems over a period of five years. The assembly of the energy solutions will take place at SFC's Indian subsidiary at the new site in Gurgaon  Haryana. The order is the largest fuel cell contract by the Indian defence forces awarded till date.The portable fuel cell systems are used by infantry and special forces units for parallel charging of multiple batteries and for powering sensors  surveillance and communication systems  among others. Their use often takes place in remote areas  at high altitudes and under extreme climatic conditions. SFC Energy's portable energy solutions are extremely reliable  easy to transport  highly intelligent  and convincing with very low consumption of the fuel methanol.The Indian government is increasingly striving to replace fossil fuel-based environmentally harmful energy systems such as diesel generators by clean energy solutions.As an important boost to the Indian government's ""Make in India"" initiative in the field of clean energy and CO 2 reduction  an agreement on strategic cooperation with mutual equity participation of local companies and production of hydrogen and methanol fuel cells in India was signed between SFC Energy and FCTec on the sidelines of the summit meeting between German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Prime Minister Shree Narendra Modi and the respective government and business delegations in New Delhi on February 25  2023.""Only a few days after signing our 'Make in India' production agreement with our partner FCTec  we have received an important milestone order for portable fuel cells from the Indian Defense Forces. This confirms our confidence in India's business potential  especially in light of the recent policy measures announced by the Indian government to promote clean energy solutions  including fuel cells. By manufacturing these systems under the 'Make in India' agreement  we aim to contribute our extensive expertise in hydrogen and fuel cell technology to help India achieve its ambitious climate change goals and support the ‚ÄúNational Green Hydrogen mission‚Äù across various industries and regions. With more than 60 000 fuel cells sold  SFC Energy's globally proven and reliable energy solutions enable efficient and emission-free power generation for a wide range of power and applications.

(""illimity"" or the ""Banca"") has acted as Global Coordinator in the process for the admission of Reway Group (""Reway""  the ""Company"" or the ""Group"") to the Euronext Growth Milan market and its subsequent listing on that exchange.Founded by Paolo Luccini  the Company is a leader in the rehabilitation of concrete works with a high strategic value (tunnels  bridges  motorway viaducts  etc.). Over a period of thirty years the Group has grown in sectors involving the restoration and seismic retrofitting of Italy's large-scale infrastructure  the installation of safety and soundproofing barriers and the finishing and lining of tunnels with lighting engineering materials  all this being the result of innovative and differentiating technologies developed together with specialised partners.Reway is the only operator in Italy capable of covering all of the activities connected with the restoration of bridges  tunnels and viaducts  acting as a ""one-stop shop"" for its customers. Against this complex package of offers  the Group holds a set of certifications that enable it to participate in the very wide range of public tenders requiring such attestations.Since 2019  operators have considerably increased the funds dedicated to the maintenance of the motorway network. According to the estimate contained in the 2020-2038 Economic and Financial Plan drawn up by Autostrade per l'Italia S.p.A. (PEF ASPI 2020-2038)  which manages 49% of Italy's motorway network  a portion of 454 million euro a year of total investments in revertible assets will be used in works that the Group estimates to be of potential interest (in Autostrade per l'Italia's network alone).At 30 June 2022  the Company had earned revenues of over 56 million euro  with EBITDA approximating 10.6 million euro (representing an EBITDA margin of 18.9%) and EBT standing at ca. 8.8 million euro. The Company's business is usually not seasonal in nature between the first and second halves of the year.The Company today received confirmation of the admission of its ordinary shares to the market. Trading is set to begin on Wednesday 8 March.Illimity has contributed to the setting-up and book-building of the operation  which is characterised by the significant interest being shown by the market. In this respect the Company has received orders worth 42 million euro  approximately 2.4 times the overall ceiling for share offers relating to listing on Euronext Growth Milan.The total placement amounts to ca. 20 million euro (including the greenshoe option)  with floating capital representing 19.1% of Reway Group's capital as a whole (if the greenshoe option is exercised  floating capital would be 20.8%). The shares are being offered at a price of 3.1 euro each  with the resulting post-capital capitalisation of the Company being over 96 million euro (including the greenshoe option). Multiple voting shares held by the leading shareholder Paolo Luccini are not included in these valuations.For further information:Investor Relations illimityillimity Bank S.p.A.

The customer base grew by a strong 34 2% in 2022  exceeding the threshold of one million customers  2 1 million companies were YE2022 in the Unifiedpost digital network. Unifiedpost has finalised its accelerated investment phase and shifted its focus to cash flow generation and is well on the way to become cash flow positive for the period of H2 2023.HighlightsStrong growth of core recurring digital processing revenue 19 1% y-o-yFY2022 Group revenue increased by 12 0% y-o-y to ‚Ç¨190 9 millionAcceleration of customer growth in 2022 (+34 2%)  strong growth for core SME product Banqup (+251 1%)Good EBITDA improvement over the year  positive EBITDA in H2 2022  in Q4 2022 up to +‚Ç¨1 8 millionA positive cash flow for the full H2 2023 is the key priority for UnifiedpostCommenting on the FY2022 results  Hans Leybaert  CEO and founder  stated: ‚ÄúIn 2022  Unifiedpost underpinned its ambitious growth path. In a year of geopolitical tensions  the war in Ukraine  the energy crisis in Europe and general price increases  our double-digit growth remained undisputed. The significant acceleration of new customer onboarding in 2022 proves the growing momentum for full digital invoicing and payments. A further acceleration is expected in the coming years as the European Commission has submitted a legislative proposal on December 8th 2022 as part of their 'VAT in the digital age' program. This is a first step towards mandatory e-invoicing for all European companies. I would like to thank all Unifiedpost employees and partners for their continued contribution to our strategic execution and for joining us in our ambitious way forward.‚ÄùStory continuesKey financial figures(EUR million) FY2022 FY2021 Change (%) Group revenue 190 9 170 5 +12 0%Digital processing revenue 126 9 106 9 +18 8% Recurring digital processing revenue 112 7 94 6 +19 1% Non-recurring digital revenue (licences + project) 14 2 12 3 +15 4% Postage & parcel optimisation revenue 64 0 63 6 +0 6% Recurring revenue (in % of total revenue) 92 5% 92 8% -0 3%pts Gross margin digital processing 41 9% 43 7% -1 8%pts EBITDA margin -3 4% -2 6% -0 8%pts R&D costs (expensed and capitalised) 36 2 33 1 +9 4% Loss for the period -43 5 -25 6 -69 9% Cash and cash equivalents 40 0 17 0 +135 3%Key business KPI‚Äôs(#) End Q4 2022 End Q4 2021 Change (%) Customers 1.063.776 792.594 +34 2% Paying customers 468.128 368.277 +27 1% Customers paid by 3rd parties 595.648 424.317 +40 4% Companies in business network 2.109.297 1.504.895 +40 2% Banqup customers 124.333 35.408 +251 1% Growth (new subscriptions) 18.255 16.346 - Migrated 70.582 - - Banqup customers Belgium (Billtobox) 40.363 28.864 +39 8% Banqup customers France (JeFacture) 5.428 2.072 +162 0%Double-digit growth rates in digital processing businessUnifiedpost grew its revenue in FY2022 by 12 0% y-o-y to ‚Ç¨190 9 million  driven by double-digit growth of the digital processing revenue of 18 8% combined with a limited growth in postage and parcel optimisation services.The Group saw its revenue from digital processing increasing to ‚Ç¨126 9 million in FY2022. This was predominantly thanks to the strong growth rate of 19 1% y-o-y in recurring digital processing revenue  i.e. digital platform revenue excluding the project and licence business. The growth is spread over different countries and markets  with the Nordics  Serbia  Romania  the Baltics  and the Benelux showing accelerating growth rates. The subscription revenue growth (i.e. SME business) was high with a 35 6% growth y-o-y.The project and licence business  which is non-recurring  contributed ‚Ç¨14 2 million to the FY2022 revenue. As indicated in the H1 2022 financial update  the non-recurring revenue is depending on the timely closing of major deals (before YE). In Q4 a large distribution deal for the French market was realised with ECMA (the French accountants federation)  which includes the creation of a joint venture between the two companies. Unifiedpost made also promising progress with several other deals  without closing them prior to YE2022. The Group expects to close these in 2023.The gross margin of the digital processing business decreased to 41 9%  a decrease of 1 8%pts y-o-y  reflecting some inflationary effects and larger customers with hybrid communication going live.Solid low single-digit growth in postage & parcel optimisation businessRevenue of postage and parcel optimisation services slightly increased over the year (+0 6% y/y to ‚Ç¨64 0 million). For existing customers  the shift from paper to digital continues and is accelerating. As a result  Unifiedpost realised lower revenue growth in the postage and parcel optimisation business. However  this was offset by two factors: Unifiedpost onboarded major new customers and increased its prices in this segment. Consequently  Unifiedpost still managed to achieve a slight growth in postage and parcel revenue over the year. It is important to underline that the postage and parcel optimisation business  which yields lower margins  is being overtaken by the digital services business  which generates higher margins and is experiencing steady double-digit growth. The postage & parcel optimisation realised a gross margin of 10 9% for FY2022  slightly down by 0 4%pts compared to FY2021  also as a consequence of inflationary effects.Unifiedpost services over 1 million companies representing 8% of all SMEs in EuropeUnifiedpost was and is ambitious in its targets for new customer onboarding. At the end of the period the customer growth was 34 2% y-o-y  a third consecutive year with a growth of at least 30%. In the fourth quarter of 2022 a new high of 76.805 new customers were onboarded onto our platform  most of them SME‚Äôs. At year-end  the Group had a total of 1.063.776 paying customers  either directly paying or paid by third parties. Unifiedpost‚Äôs business network expanded in 2022 to over 2 million companies (2.109.297)  representing an estimated 8 4% of SMEs in Europe. Today Unifiedpost is the most dominant e-invoice and e-payment provider in the SME-segment.The number of Banqup (incl. Billtobox and JeFacture) customers strongly grew to 124.333  reflecting a growth rate of 251 1% y-o-y. Although France has delayed the adoption of mandatory e-invoicing  over 5.428 early adopters onboarded on the JeFacture solution.Overall average revenue per user (ARPU) in the digital processing business amounted to ‚Ç¨27 3 in Q4 2022. This is an increase due to the strong quarter for non-recurring digital revenue. 88 8% of the total digital processing revenue resulted from recurring services.FY2022 EBITDA / result impacted by a peak in roll-out cost and inflationBoth segments combined  i.e. combining the digital processing revenue and postage and parcel optimisation services  led to total revenue of ‚Ç¨190 9 million and a gross profit of ‚Ç¨60 2 million. Gross margin slightly decreased to 31 5% (FY 2021: 31 6%).During FY2022  the Group spent ‚Ç¨36 2 million on research and development (R&D)  of which 61% was capitalised. The R&D spending is equivalent to 28 5% (down 2 5%pts y-o-y) of digital processing revenue. After having self-developed the platform successfully and rolling out the product  Unifiedpost has now been able to reduce its R&D spending as a percentage of total digital processing revenue.General and Administrative cost (G&A) accounted to ‚Ç¨45 8 million  24 0% of the Group‚Äôs total revenue. The Group was able to stabilise its G&A costs in a year with increasing service and labour cost. Consequently  G&A cost ratio went up by just 0 3%pts compared to last year. Some operational costs related to the roll-out of Banqup have reached their peak during 2022 and have started to decline in absolute levels.Sales & Marketing expenses went up from ‚Ç¨24 9 million in 2021 to ‚Ç¨29 2 million in FY2022  or from 14 6% of total revenue to 15 3% in FY2022. The increase is caused by investments of the Group in local sales teams that are close to the business and customers. This platform and sales set-up was an important step for the Group in 2022. It was in line with the strategic approach to operate the global platform locally  with local teams and software that is adapted to local requirements and legislation.The Group reported an EBITDA loss of -‚Ç¨6 4 million for FY 2022. After a negative H1 2022 (H1 2022 EBITDA of -‚Ç¨6 5 million)  Unifiedpost released a slightly positive EBITDA in H2  in Q42022 even +‚Ç¨1 8 million. The positive development on the EBITDA-level proves that Unifiedpost is well on track to reach its goal delivering a positive cash flow for H2 2023.The loss from operations for the period amounted to ‚Ç¨29 9 million. The loss for the period is ‚Ç¨43 5 million. The loss for the period is impacted by higher financial expenses (-‚Ç¨9 4 million of which -‚Ç¨8 0 million is linked to Francisco Partners funding)  by a loss of -‚Ç¨1 9 million on an associate company (Facturel  joint investment with ECMA in France) and by the change in fair value of financial liabilities (-‚Ç¨4 3 million). The latter is linked to the settlement of the earn-out with the former Crossinx shareholders  as published on 21st October 2022 (-‚Ç¨4 8 million). By settling the earn-out agreement with Crossinx  Unifiedpost eliminated the risk of having to pay out an earn-out of ‚Ç¨60 million in the future - of which ‚Ç¨20 million in cash. The settlement of the earn-out through the repayment of 1 3 million shares worth ‚Ç¨4 8 million is therefore fully in line with our announced focus on making our cash flow positive.Funding securedThe cash flow from financing activities amounted to +‚Ç¨67 6 million at the end of the period. Unifiedpost‚Äôs cash and cash equivalents increased from ‚Ç¨17 0 million at YE 2021 to ‚Ç¨40 0 million at YE 2022. The Group also has ‚Ç¨17 7 million of undrawn financing facilities. The increase in cash position was due to the ‚Ç¨100 million five-year senior facilities agreement  provided by Francisco Partners  a leading global investment firm that specialises in partnering with technology-enabled businesses. The facility is structured in a term loan facility A of ‚Ç¨75 million which has been drawn at closing and a capex facility B of ‚Ç¨25 million which has been drawn in December 2022. Unifiedpost met all covenants checks during the year 2022.The Group‚Äôs net debt position at year end 2022 amounted to ‚Ç¨69 4 million.Sufficient liquidity for growth pathUnifiedpost‚Äôs management expects that the Group is equipped with sufficient liquidity until cash flow break-even will be reached. The Group targets to be cash flow positive by the second semester of 2023. The Group is well on the way with the cost management program and can benefit from the growth of the customer base and increasing recurring processing revenue.Increasing tailwinds in the addressable markets: EU Commission publishes law proposal to revamp EU‚Äôs VAT systemWith the geographical expansion in 2021  Unifiedpost unlocked the market potential in these countries in the course of 2022 driven by the rollout-out of business. The momentum and trend of digitisation as well as governments wanting to close the VAT-gap remain key in all markets. In response to sustainably growing digitisation of the economy  on 8 December 2022 the European Commission published its long-awaited proposals to revamp the EU‚Äôs VAT system. With this proposal  the EU wants to further modernise VATreporting obligations and to address the challenges of the platform economy  by updating the VAT rules applicable. These are positive proposals in view of Unifiedpost‚Äôs business model.ESGA good corporate citizenship has always been fundamental and part of Unifiedpost‚Äôs DNA. The Company recognizes its responsibility to consider the impact of its business on the environment and society  and is committed to integrating sustainability into our business strategy. In 2022  the ESG-roadmap drawn up the year before  was further implemented and for the first time  data gathering across all entities was kicked off.Positive cash flow expected for H2 2023[INSIDE INFORMATION] In 2023 and the years ahead Group management expects to significantly benefit from the growth in its key markets. The mandatory digital e-invoicing policies several European countries have implemented and will implement will have a positive effect on customers and revenue. With the changed economic circumstances and business conditions  the Company has decided to make the target to become cash flow positive its only target. The target remains to be cash flow positive for H2 2023.<End>The auditor  BDO R√©viseurs d‚ÄôEntreprises SRL  has confirmed that audit of the consolidated financial information for the year ended 31 December 2022 as included in this press release is substantially completed.Investors & Media webcastManagement will host a live video webcast for analysts  investors and media today at 10:00 a.m. CET.A recording will be available shortly after the event.

The decrease was driven by actions taken by management to lower Calyxt‚Äôs operating expenses.Cash runway  considering interim funding to be provided by Cibus as described in the Merger Agreement  is sufficient to fund operations through the second quarter of 2023.About CalyxtCalyxt (Nasdaq: CLXT) is a plant-based synthetic biology company.

Only the New Shares not covered by subscriptions on an irreducible basis will be allocated among subscribers on a reducible basis  within the limit of their requests and in proportion to the number of existing shares whose PSRs have been exercised in order to subscribe on an irreducible basis.The PSRs may only be exercised in a number allowing the subscription of a whole number of New Shares. Holders of PSRs not holding a sufficient number of existing shares to obtain a whole number of New Shares by way of irreducible subscription will have to buy the number of PSRs required to subscribe for a whole number of New Shares on Euronext Growth Paris.Fractional PSRs may be sold on Euronext Growth Paris during the PSR trading period.To exercise their PSRs  holders must make a request to their authorised financial intermediary at any time between 10 March 2023 and 24 March 2023 inclusive and pay the corresponding subscription price.

The purpose of the Offering is to provide the Company with the means to finance: working capital requirements for the Horizon 2 production line (approximately 40% of the Offering proceeds);further preliminary design studies for the Horizon 3 plant  known as ViaViridia (approximately 35%);additional R&D to further reduce process costs with a view to exploitation at Horizon 4 for the production of sustainable aviation and road fuels (approximately 25%).If the Offering is only 75% subscribed  i.e. ‚Ç¨5.6 million  the proceeds will be allocated first to the Horizon 2 production line (approximately 50% of the proceeds) and the continuation of the preliminary design studies for the ViaViridia plant (approximately 40%)  while the Company will adapt the additional funds allocated to R&D in view of Horizon 4 accordingly (approximately 10%). Samuel Dubruque  Chief Financial Officer of the Company  said: ‚ÄúThis offering comes at a pivotal time for the Company  which is now priming itself for its foremost objective of achieving strong revenue growth.‚Äù Marc Delcourt  Chief Executive Officer and co-founder of the Company  said: ‚ÄúNew markets are gradually opening up to us  consolidating our roadmap by stages. Our next big battle over the next few months will be to finance the ViaViridia plant  where operations are now scheduled to start in mid-2026.

The Offering is being carried out on the basis of the authority delegated under the 8th resolution adopted by the Combined General Meeting of the Company‚Äôs Shareholders held on 2 June 2022. A notice to shareholders relating to the Offering will be published in the Bulletin des Annonces L√©gales et Obligatoires (BALO) on 8 March 2023. Maximum gross amount of Offering and maximum number of New Shares The gross amount of the Offering  including the share premium  is ‚Ç¨7 472 568 (comprising a par value of ‚Ç¨180 497 and a share premium of ‚Ç¨7 292 071)  corresponding to the issuance of 3 609 936 New Shares. Depending on the volume of demand  the Company reserves the right to exercise partially the extension clause (‚ÄúExtension Clause‚Äù) and to increase the number of New Shares to be issued by an additional 254 798 New Shares  thereby bringing the total number of New Shares to be issued under the Offering to a maximum of 3 864 734 New Shares and bringing the maximum gross amount of the Offering to ‚Ç¨7 999 999. The New Shares under the Offering will be the subject of an application for admission to trading on the Euronext Growth market in Paris. They will be immediately fungible with the existing shares of the Company already traded on Euronext Growth Paris and will be tradable  from that date  on the same line as those shares under the same ISIN code (FR0011052257 ‚Äì Symbol: ALGBE). Subscription price of the New Shares The subscription price has been set at ‚Ç¨2.07 per New Share  comprising a par value of ‚Ç¨0.05 and a share premium of ‚Ç¨2.02  representing a discount of 25.7% on the closing price on 3 March 2023 (‚Ç¨2.785). Subscription period The subscription period for the New Shares will run from 10 March 2023 to 24 March 2023 inclusive. Terms of subscription Subscription for the New Shares will be reserved  by preference  to (i) holders of existing shares registered in their securities account at close of trading on 7 March 2023  to whom one PSR per existing share held will be allocated on 8 March 2023  and (ii) transferees of PSRs. Holders of PSRs may subscribe: to their statutory entitlement on an irreducible basis  at the rate of 6 New Shares per 25 existing shares held for additional shares on a reducible basis  for the number of New Shares they wish to buy in addition to their statutory entitlement to New Shares resulting from the exercise of their PSRs on an irreducible basis. Only the New Shares not covered by subscriptions on an irreducible basis will be allocated among subscribers on a reducible basis  within the limit of their requests and in proportion to the number of existing shares whose PSRs have been exercised in order to subscribe on an irreducible basis. The PSRs may only be exercised in a number allowing the subscription of a whole number of New Shares. Holders of PSRs not holding a sufficient number of existing shares to obtain a whole number of New Shares by way of irreducible subscription will have to buy the number of PSRs required to subscribe for a whole number of New Shares on Euronext Growth Paris. Fractional PSRs may be sold on Euronext Growth Paris during the PSR trading period. To exercise their PSRs  holders must make a request to their authorised financial intermediary at any time between 10 March 2023 and 24 March 2023 inclusive and pay the corresponding subscription price. PSRs not exercised will automatically lapse at the end of the subscription period  i.e. on 24 March 2023 at the close of trading. The funds paid in respect of subscriptions will be pooled by Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale Securities Services  which will be responsible for drawing up the certificate of deposit of the funds recording the completion of the capital increase and the issue of the New Shares. Requests to subscribe on an unrestricted basis In addition to the possibility of subscribing on an irreducible and reducible basis in accordance with the terms and conditions specified  any natural or legal person  whether or not they hold PSRs  may subscribe to the Offering on an unrestricted basis. Persons wishing to subscribe on an unrestricted basis must send their request to their authorised financial intermediary at any time during the subscription period and pay the corresponding subscription price. Pursuant to the provisions of Article L. 225-134 of the French Commercial Code  subscriptions on an unrestricted basis will only be honoured if the subscriptions on an irreducible basis and on a reducible basis do not cover the entirety of the Offering  in which case the Board of Directors will have the option of freely allocating New Shares not subscribed  in whole or in part  among the persons (shareholders or third parties) of its choice who have submitted requests for subscriptions on an unrestricted basis. Theoretical value of PSR ‚Ç¨.0138 (based on the closing share price on 3 March 2023  i.e. ‚Ç¨2.785). The subscription price of the New Shares represents a discount of 21.79% on the theoretical value after detachment of the PSR. Listing of PSRs The PSRs will be listed and traded on Euronext Growth Paris under ISIN code FR001400GG91 between 8 March 2023 and 22 March 2023 inclusive. If they are not used to subscribe for New Shares or sold  they will lapse at the end of the subscription period and their value will be nil. PSRs in respect of treasury shares held by the Company Pursuant to Article L. 225-206 of the French Commercial Code  the Company may not subscribe for its own shares. PSRs corresponding to treasury shares held by the Company at 8 March 2023 will be sold on Euronext Growth Paris before the end of their trading period under the conditions provided for by Article L. 225-210 of the French Commercial Code. Limit on Offering amount In the event that the subscriptions received on an irreducible basis  on a reducible basis and on an unrestricted basis do not absorb the entirety of the Offering  the Board of Directors may limit the amount of the Offering to the amount of subscriptions received  in accordance with Article L. 225-134 of the French Commercial Code  provided that subscriptions received represent at least ‚Ç¨5 604 426 corresponding to 75% of the initial gross amount of the Offering. Subscription and underwriting commitments Marc Delcourt  Chief Executive Officer and co-founder of the Company  has undertaken to subscribe for ‚Ç¨0.16m. The L‚ÄôOREAL Group  through its BOLD (Business Opportunities for L‚ÄôOr√©al Development) private equity fund  has undertaken  subject to certain conditions  to subscribe in proportion to its share of the Company‚Äôs capital (i.e. 13.1%)  for around ‚Ç¨980 000. The Company is not aware of the intentions of its other shareholders. In addition  pursuant to irrevocable undertakings given to the Company  12 qualified investors (the ‚ÄúUnderwriters‚Äù) have undertaken to subscribe for the New Shares that have not been subscribed for on an irreducible basis  on a reducible basis and on an unrestricted basis  at the end of the subscription period in a maximum amount of ‚Ç¨4 482 500  representing a maximum of approximately 60% of the Offering. The New Shares not covered by subscriptions on an irreducible  reducible and unrestricted basis will be distributed and allocated to the Underwriters in proportion to their underwriting commitments and within the limit of 75% of the initial gross amount of the Offering. The underwriting commitments of the Underwriters are summarised below: Amount underwritten Alpha Blue Ocean ‚Ç¨3 000 000 Nice & Green ‚Ç¨500 000 Dynasty AM ‚Ç¨300 000 Sully Patrimoine ‚Ç¨200 000 Jerome Marsac ‚Ç¨142 500 Diede Van Den Ouden ‚Ç¨120 500 Other Underwriters ‚Ç¨219 500 Total ‚Ç¨4 482 500 In respect of these underwriting commitments  the Underwriters will receive a fee in the aggregate amount of ‚Ç¨224 125 out of the gross proceeds of the Offering. This fee will be payable in full regardless of the number of New Shares actually purchased by the Underwriters within the framework of the Offering. If the Offering is 75% subscribed  this fee would represent 3.99% of the gross proceeds. If the Offering is 100% subscribed  this fee would represent 2.99% of the gross proceeds. Furthermore  in case the Underwriters should subscribe to New Shares pursuant to their irrevocable undertakings  an additional fee representing 1% of the amount of the undertakings should be paid by the Company. Net proceeds from the Offering Assuming full subscription of the Offering (i.e. an amount of ‚Ç¨7.5 million) including 100% of commitments from the Underwriters  the total net proceeds of the Offering (corresponding to the gross amount less all financial  legal and communication fees relating to the Offering) would be approximately ‚Ç¨6.9 million. Assuming subscription of the Offering in the proportion of 75% (i.e. an amount of ‚Ç¨5.6 million) including 75% of commitments from the Underwriters  the total net proceeds of the Offering (corresponding to the gross amount less all fees relating to the Offering) would be approximately ‚Ç¨5.1 million. Retention and lock-up undertakings No forbearance or retention commitment has been made.

The customer base grew by a strong 34 2% in 2022  exceeding the threshold of one million customers  2 1 million companies were YE2022 in the Unifiedpost digital network. Unifiedpost has finalised its accelerated investment phase and shifted its focus to cash flow generation and is well on the way to become cash flow positive for the period of H2 2023. Highlights Strong growth of core recurring digital processing revenue 19 1% y-o-yFY2022 Group revenue increased by 12 0% y-o-y to ‚Ç¨190 9 millionAcceleration of customer growth in 2022 (+34 2%)  strong growth for core SME product Banqup (+251 1%)Good EBITDA improvement over the year  positive EBITDA in H2 2022  in Q4 2022 up to +‚Ç¨1 8 millionA positive cash flow for the full H2 2023 is the key priority for Unifiedpost Commenting on the FY2022 results  Hans Leybaert  CEO and founder  stated: ‚ÄúIn 2022  Unifiedpost underpinned its ambitious growth path. In a year of geopolitical tensions  the war in Ukraine  the energy crisis in Europe and general price increases  our double-digit growth remained undisputed. The significant acceleration of new customer onboarding in 2022 proves the growing momentum for full digital invoicing and payments. A further acceleration is expected in the coming years as the European Commission has submitted a legislative proposal on December 8th 2022 as part of their 'VAT in the digital age' program. This is a first step towards mandatory e-invoicing for all European companies. I would like to thank all Unifiedpost employees and partners for their continued contribution to our strategic execution and for joining us in our ambitious way forward.‚Äù Key financial figures (EUR million) FY2022 FY2021 Change (%) Group revenue 190 9 170 5 +12 0%Digital processing revenue 126 9 106 9 +18 8% Recurring digital processing revenue 112 7 94 6 +19 1% Non-recurring digital revenue (licences + project) 14 2 12 3 +15 4% Postage & parcel optimisation revenue 64 0 63 6 +0 6% Recurring revenue (in % of total revenue) 92 5% 92 8% -0 3%pts Gross margin digital processing 41 9% 43 7% -1 8%pts EBITDA margin -3 4% -2 6% -0 8%pts R&D costs (expensed and capitalised) 36 2 33 1 +9 4% Loss for the period -43 5 -25 6 -69 9% Cash and cash equivalents 40 0 17 0 +135 3% Key business KPI‚Äôs (#) End Q4 2022 End Q4 2021 Change (%) Customers 1.063.776 792.594 +34 2% Paying customers 468.128 368.277 +27 1% Customers paid by 3rd parties 595.648 424.317 +40 4% Companies in business network 2.109.297 1.504.895 +40 2% Banqup customers 124.333 35.408 +251 1% Growth (new subscriptions) 18.255 16.346 - Migrated 70.582 - - Banqup customers Belgium (Billtobox) 40.363 28.864 +39 8% Banqup customers France (JeFacture) 5.428 2.072 +162 0% Double-digit growth rates in digital processing business Unifiedpost grew its revenue in FY2022 by 12 0% y-o-y to ‚Ç¨190 9 million  driven by double-digit growth of the digital processing revenue of 18 8% combined with a limited growth in postage and parcel optimisation services. The Group saw its revenue from digital processing increasing to ‚Ç¨126 9 million in FY2022. This was predominantly thanks to the strong growth rate of 19 1% y-o-y in recurring digital processing revenue  i.e. digital platform revenue excluding the project and licence business. The growth is spread over different countries and markets  with the Nordics  Serbia  Romania  the Baltics  and the Benelux showing accelerating growth rates. The subscription revenue growth (i.e. SME business) was high with a 35 6% growth y-o-y. The project and licence business  which is non-recurring  contributed ‚Ç¨14 2 million to the FY2022 revenue. As indicated in the H1 2022 financial update  the non-recurring revenue is depending on the timely closing of major deals (before YE). In Q4 a large distribution deal for the French market was realised with ECMA (the French accountants federation)  which includes the creation of a joint venture between the two companies. Unifiedpost made also promising progress with several other deals  without closing them prior to YE2022. The Group expects to close these in 2023. The gross margin of the digital processing business decreased to 41 9%  a decrease of 1 8%pts y-o-y  reflecting some inflationary effects and larger customers with hybrid communication going live. Solid low single-digit growth in postage & parcel optimisation business Revenue of postage and parcel optimisation services slightly increased over the year (+0 6% y/y to ‚Ç¨64 0 million). For existing customers  the shift from paper to digital continues and is accelerating. As a result  Unifiedpost realised lower revenue growth in the postage and parcel optimisation business. However  this was offset by two factors: Unifiedpost onboarded major new customers and increased its prices in this segment. Consequently  Unifiedpost still managed to achieve a slight growth in postage and parcel revenue over the year. It is important to underline that the postage and parcel optimisation business  which yields lower margins  is being overtaken by the digital services business  which generates higher margins and is experiencing steady double-digit growth. The postage & parcel optimisation realised a gross margin of 10 9% for FY2022  slightly down by 0 4%pts compared to FY2021  also as a consequence of inflationary effects. Unifiedpost services over 1 million companies representing 8% of all SMEs in Europe Unifiedpost was and is ambitious in its targets for new customer onboarding. At the end of the period the customer growth was 34 2% y-o-y  a third consecutive year with a growth of at least 30%. In the fourth quarter of 2022 a new high of 76.805 new customers were onboarded onto our platform  most of them SME‚Äôs. At year-end  the Group had a total of 1.063.776 paying customers  either directly paying or paid by third parties. Unifiedpost‚Äôs business network expanded in 2022 to over 2 million companies (2.109.297)  representing an estimated 8 4% of SMEs in Europe. Today Unifiedpost is the most dominant e-invoice and e-payment provider in the SME-segment. The number of Banqup (incl. Billtobox and JeFacture) customers strongly grew to 124.333  reflecting a growth rate of 251 1% y-o-y. Although France has delayed the adoption of mandatory e-invoicing  over 5.428 early adopters onboarded on the JeFacture solution. Overall average revenue per user (ARPU) in the digital processing business amounted to ‚Ç¨27 3 in Q4 2022. This is an increase due to the strong quarter for non-recurring digital revenue. 88 8% of the total digital processing revenue resulted from recurring services. FY2022 EBITDA / result impacted by a peak in roll-out cost and inflation Both segments combined  i.e. combining the digital processing revenue and postage and parcel optimisation services  led to total revenue of ‚Ç¨190 9 million and a gross profit of ‚Ç¨60 2 million. Gross margin slightly decreased to 31 5% (FY 2021: 31 6%). During FY2022  the Group spent ‚Ç¨36 2 million on research and development (R&D)  of which 61% was capitalised. The R&D spending is equivalent to 28 5% (down 2 5%pts y-o-y) of digital processing revenue. After having self-developed the platform successfully and rolling out the product  Unifiedpost has now been able to reduce its R&D spending as a percentage of total digital processing revenue. General and Administrative cost (G&A) accounted to ‚Ç¨45 8 million  24 0% of the Group‚Äôs total revenue. The Group was able to stabilise its G&A costs in a year with increasing service and labour cost. Consequently  G&A cost ratio went up by just 0 3%pts compared to last year. Some operational costs related to the roll-out of Banqup have reached their peak during 2022 and have started to decline in absolute levels. Sales & Marketing expenses went up from ‚Ç¨24 9 million in 2021 to ‚Ç¨29 2 million in FY2022  or from 14 6% of total revenue to 15 3% in FY2022. The increase is caused by investments of the Group in local sales teams that are close to the business and customers. This platform and sales set-up was an important step for the Group in 2022. It was in line with the strategic approach to operate the global platform locally  with local teams and software that is adapted to local requirements and legislation. The Group reported an EBITDA loss of -‚Ç¨6 4 million for FY 2022. After a negative H1 2022 (H1 2022 EBITDA of -‚Ç¨6 5 million)  Unifiedpost released a slightly positive EBITDA in H2  in Q42022 even +‚Ç¨1 8 million. The positive development on the EBITDA-level proves that Unifiedpost is well on track to reach its goal delivering a positive cash flow for H2 2023. The loss from operations for the period amounted to ‚Ç¨29 9 million. The loss for the period is ‚Ç¨43 5 million. The loss for the period is impacted by higher financial expenses (-‚Ç¨9 4 million of which -‚Ç¨8 0 million is linked to Francisco Partners funding)  by a loss of -‚Ç¨1 9 million on an associate company (Facturel  joint investment with ECMA in France) and by the change in fair value of financial liabilities (-‚Ç¨4 3 million). The latter is linked to the settlement of the earn-out with the former Crossinx shareholders  as published on 21st October 2022 (-‚Ç¨4 8 million). By settling the earn-out agreement with Crossinx  Unifiedpost eliminated the risk of having to pay out an earn-out of ‚Ç¨60 million in the future - of which ‚Ç¨20 million in cash. The settlement of the earn-out through the repayment of 1 3 million shares worth ‚Ç¨4 8 million is therefore fully in line with our announced focus on making our cash flow positive. Funding secured The cash flow from financing activities amounted to +‚Ç¨67 6 million at the end of the period. Unifiedpost‚Äôs cash and cash equivalents increased from ‚Ç¨17 0 million at YE 2021 to ‚Ç¨40 0 million at YE 2022. The Group also has ‚Ç¨17 7 million of undrawn financing facilities. The increase in cash position was due to the ‚Ç¨100 million five-year senior facilities agreement  provided by Francisco Partners  a leading global investment firm that specialises in partnering with technology-enabled businesses. The facility is structured in a term loan facility A of ‚Ç¨75 million which has been drawn at closing and a capex facility B of ‚Ç¨25 million which has been drawn in December 2022. Unifiedpost met all covenants checks during the year 2022. The Group‚Äôs net debt position at year end 2022 amounted to ‚Ç¨69 4 million. Sufficient liquidity for growth path Unifiedpost‚Äôs management expects that the Group is equipped with sufficient liquidity until cash flow break-even will be reached. The Group targets to be cash flow positive by the second semester of 2023. The Group is well on the way with the cost management program and can benefit from the growth of the customer base and increasing recurring processing revenue. Increasing tailwinds in the addressable markets: EU Commission publishes law proposal to revamp EU‚Äôs VAT system With the geographical expansion in 2021  Unifiedpost unlocked the market potential in these countries in the course of 2022 driven by the rollout-out of business. The momentum and trend of digitisation as well as governments wanting to close the VAT-gap remain key in all markets. In response to sustainably growing digitisation of the economy  on 8 December 2022 the European Commission published its long-awaited proposals to revamp the EU‚Äôs VAT system. With this proposal  the EU wants to further modernise VAT reporting obligations and to address the challenges of the platform economy  by updating the VAT rules applicable. These are positive proposals in view of Unifiedpost‚Äôs business model. ESG A good corporate citizenship has always been fundamental and part of Unifiedpost‚Äôs DNA. The Company recognizes its responsibility to consider the impact of its business on the environment and society  and is committed to integrating sustainability into our business strategy. In 2022  the ESG-roadmap drawn up the year before  was further implemented and for the first time  data gathering across all entities was kicked off. Positive cash flow expected for H2 2023 [INSIDE INFORMATION] In 2023 and the years ahead Group management expects to significantly benefit from the growth in its key markets. The mandatory digital e-invoicing policies several European countries have implemented and will implement will have a positive effect on customers and revenue. With the changed economic circumstances and business conditions  the Company has decided to make the target to become cash flow positive its only target. The target remains to be cash flow positive for H2 2023. <End> The auditor  BDO R√©viseurs d‚ÄôEntreprises SRL  has confirmed that audit of the consolidated financial information for the year ended 31 December 2022 as included in this press release is substantially completed.Investors & Media webcast Management will host a live video webcast for analysts  investors and media today at 10:00 a.m. CET.

The customer base grew by a strong 34 2% in 2022  exceeding the threshold of one million customers  2 1 million companies were YE2022 in the Unifiedpost digital network. Unifiedpost has finalised its accelerated investment phase and shifted its focus to cash flow generation and is well on the way to become cash flow positive for the period of H2 2023.HighlightsStrong growth of core recurring digital processing revenue 19 1% y-o-yFY2022 Group revenue increased by 12 0% y-o-y to ‚Ç¨190 9 millionAcceleration of customer growth in 2022 (+34 2%)  strong growth for core SME product Banqup (+251 1%)Good EBITDA improvement over the year  positive EBITDA in H2 2022  in Q4 2022 up to +‚Ç¨1 8 millionA positive cash flow for the full H2 2023 is the key priority for UnifiedpostCommenting on the FY2022 results  Hans Leybaert  CEO and founder  stated: ‚ÄúIn 2022  Unifiedpost underpinned its ambitious growth path. In a year of geopolitical tensions  the war in Ukraine  the energy crisis in Europe and general price increases  our double-digit growth remained undisputed. The significant acceleration of new customer onboarding in 2022 proves the growing momentum for full digital invoicing and payments. A further acceleration is expected in the coming years as the European Commission has submitted a legislative proposal on December 8th 2022 as part of their 'VAT in the digital age' program. This is a first step towards mandatory e-invoicing for all European companies. I would like to thank all Unifiedpost employees and partners for their continued contribution to our strategic execution and for joining us in our ambitious way forward.‚ÄùKey financial figures(EUR million) FY2022 FY2021 Change (%) Group revenue 190 9 170 5 +12 0%Digital processing revenue 126 9 106 9 +18 8% Recurring digital processing revenue 112 7 94 6 +19 1% Non-recurring digital revenue (licences + project) 14 2 12 3 +15 4% Postage & parcel optimisation revenue 64 0 63 6 +0 6% Recurring revenue (in % of total revenue) 92 5% 92 8% -0 3%pts Gross margin digital processing 41 9% 43 7% -1 8%pts EBITDA margin -3 4% -2 6% -0 8%pts R&D costs (expensed and capitalised) 36 2 33 1 +9 4% Loss for the period -43 5 -25 6 -69 9% Cash and cash equivalents 40 0 17 0 +135 3%Key business KPI‚Äôs(#) End Q4 2022 End Q4 2021 Change (%) Customers 1.063.776 792.594 +34 2% Paying customers 468.128 368.277 +27 1% Customers paid by 3rd parties 595.648 424.317 +40 4% Companies in business network 2.109.297 1.504.895 +40 2% Banqup customers 124.333 35.408 +251 1% Growth (new subscriptions) 18.255 16.346 - Migrated 70.582 - - Banqup customers Belgium (Billtobox) 40.363 28.864 +39 8% Banqup customers France (JeFacture) 5.428 2.072 +162 0%Double-digit growth rates in digital processing businessUnifiedpost grew its revenue in FY2022 by 12 0% y-o-y to ‚Ç¨190 9 million  driven by double-digit growth of the digital processing revenue of 18 8% combined with a limited growth in postage and parcel optimisation services.The Group saw its revenue from digital processing increasing to ‚Ç¨126 9 million in FY2022. This was predominantly thanks to the strong growth rate of 19 1% y-o-y in recurring digital processing revenue  i.e. digital platform revenue excluding the project and licence business. The growth is spread over different countries and markets  with the Nordics  Serbia  Romania  the Baltics  and the Benelux showing accelerating growth rates. The subscription revenue growth (i.e. SME business) was high with a 35 6% growth y-o-y.The project and licence business  which is non-recurring  contributed ‚Ç¨14 2 million to the FY2022 revenue. As indicated in the H1 2022 financial update  the non-recurring revenue is depending on the timely closing of major deals (before YE). In Q4 a large distribution deal for the French market was realised with ECMA (the French accountants federation)  which includes the creation of a joint venture between the two companies. Unifiedpost made also promising progress with several other deals  without closing them prior to YE2022. The Group expects to close these in 2023.The gross margin of the digital processing business decreased to 41 9%  a decrease of 1 8%pts y-o-y  reflecting some inflationary effects and larger customers with hybrid communication going live.Solid low single-digit growth in postage & parcel optimisation businessRevenue of postage and parcel optimisation services slightly increased over the year (+0 6% y/y to ‚Ç¨64 0 million). For existing customers  the shift from paper to digital continues and is accelerating. As a result  Unifiedpost realised lower revenue growth in the postage and parcel optimisation business. However  this was offset by two factors: Unifiedpost onboarded major new customers and increased its prices in this segment. Consequently  Unifiedpost still managed to achieve a slight growth in postage and parcel revenue over the year. It is important to underline that the postage and parcel optimisation business  which yields lower margins  is being overtaken by the digital services business  which generates higher margins and is experiencing steady double-digit growth. The postage & parcel optimisation realised a gross margin of 10 9% for FY2022  slightly down by 0 4%pts compared to FY2021  also as a consequence of inflationary effects.Unifiedpost services over 1 million companies representing 8% of all SMEs in EuropeUnifiedpost was and is ambitious in its targets for new customer onboarding. At the end of the period the customer growth was 34 2% y-o-y  a third consecutive year with a growth of at least 30%. In the fourth quarter of 2022 a new high of 76.805 new customers were onboarded onto our platform  most of them SME‚Äôs. At year-end  the Group had a total of 1.063.776 paying customers  either directly paying or paid by third parties. Unifiedpost‚Äôs business network expanded in 2022 to over 2 million companies (2.109.297)  representing an estimated 8 4% of SMEs in Europe. Today Unifiedpost is the most dominant e-invoice and e-payment provider in the SME-segment.The number of Banqup (incl. Billtobox and JeFacture) customers strongly grew to 124.333  reflecting a growth rate of 251 1% y-o-y. Although France has delayed the adoption of mandatory e-invoicing  over 5.428 early adopters onboarded on the JeFacture solution.Overall average revenue per user (ARPU) in the digital processing business amounted to ‚Ç¨27 3 in Q4 2022. This is an increase due to the strong quarter for non-recurring digital revenue. 88 8% of the total digital processing revenue resulted from recurring services.FY2022 EBITDA / result impacted by a peak in roll-out cost and inflationBoth segments combined  i.e. combining the digital processing revenue and postage and parcel optimisation services  led to total revenue of ‚Ç¨190 9 million and a gross profit of ‚Ç¨60 2 million. Gross margin slightly decreased to 31 5% (FY 2021: 31 6%).During FY2022  the Group spent ‚Ç¨36 2 million on research and development (R&D)  of which 61% was capitalised. The R&D spending is equivalent to 28 5% (down 2 5%pts y-o-y) of digital processing revenue. After having self-developed the platform successfully and rolling out the product  Unifiedpost has now been able to reduce its R&D spending as a percentage of total digital processing revenue.General and Administrative cost (G&A) accounted to ‚Ç¨45 8 million  24 0% of the Group‚Äôs total revenue. The Group was able to stabilise its G&A costs in a year with increasing service and labour cost. Consequently  G&A cost ratio went up by just 0 3%pts compared to last year. Some operational costs related to the roll-out of Banqup have reached their peak during 2022 and have started to decline in absolute levels.Sales & Marketing expenses went up from ‚Ç¨24 9 million in 2021 to ‚Ç¨29 2 million in FY2022  or from 14 6% of total revenue to 15 3% in FY2022. The increase is caused by investments of the Group in local sales teams that are close to the business and customers. This platform and sales set-up was an important step for the Group in 2022. It was in line with the strategic approach to operate the global platform locally  with local teams and software that is adapted to local requirements and legislation.The Group reported an EBITDA loss of -‚Ç¨6 4 million for FY 2022. After a negative H1 2022 (H1 2022 EBITDA of -‚Ç¨6 5 million)  Unifiedpost released a slightly positive EBITDA in H2  in Q42022 even +‚Ç¨1 8 million. The positive development on the EBITDA-level proves that Unifiedpost is well on track to reach its goal delivering a positive cash flow for H2 2023.The loss from operations for the period amounted to ‚Ç¨29 9 million. The loss for the period is ‚Ç¨43 5 million. The loss for the period is impacted by higher financial expenses (-‚Ç¨9 4 million of which -‚Ç¨8 0 million is linked to Francisco Partners funding)  by a loss of -‚Ç¨1 9 million on an associate company (Facturel  joint investment with ECMA in France) and by the change in fair value of financial liabilities (-‚Ç¨4 3 million). The latter is linked to the settlement of the earn-out with the former Crossinx shareholders  as published on 21st October 2022 (-‚Ç¨4 8 million). By settling the earn-out agreement with Crossinx  Unifiedpost eliminated the risk of having to pay out an earn-out of ‚Ç¨60 million in the future - of which ‚Ç¨20 million in cash. The settlement of the earn-out through the repayment of 1 3 million shares worth ‚Ç¨4 8 million is therefore fully in line with our announced focus on making our cash flow positive.Funding securedThe cash flow from financing activities amounted to +‚Ç¨67 6 million at the end of the period. Unifiedpost‚Äôs cash and cash equivalents increased from ‚Ç¨17 0 million at YE 2021 to ‚Ç¨40 0 million at YE 2022. The Group also has ‚Ç¨17 7 million of undrawn financing facilities. The increase in cash position was due to the ‚Ç¨100 million five-year senior facilities agreement  provided by Francisco Partners  a leading global investment firm that specialises in partnering with technology-enabled businesses. The facility is structured in a term loan facility A of ‚Ç¨75 million which has been drawn at closing and a capex facility B of ‚Ç¨25 million which has been drawn in December 2022. Unifiedpost met all covenants checks during the year 2022.The Group‚Äôs net debt position at year end 2022 amounted to ‚Ç¨69 4 million.Sufficient liquidity for growth pathUnifiedpost‚Äôs management expects that the Group is equipped with sufficient liquidity until cash flow break-even will be reached. The Group targets to be cash flow positive by the second semester of 2023. The Group is well on the way with the cost management program and can benefit from the growth of the customer base and increasing recurring processing revenue.Increasing tailwinds in the addressable markets: EU Commission publishes law proposal to revamp EU‚Äôs VAT systemWith the geographical expansion in 2021  Unifiedpost unlocked the market potential in these countries in the course of 2022 driven by the rollout-out of business. The momentum and trend of digitisation as well as governments wanting to close the VAT-gap remain key in all markets. In response to sustainably growing digitisation of the economy  on 8 December 2022 the European Commission published its long-awaited proposals to revamp the EU‚Äôs VAT system. With this proposal  the EU wants to further modernise VATreporting obligations and to address the challenges of the platform economy  by updating the VAT rules applicable. These are positive proposals in view of Unifiedpost‚Äôs business model.ESGA good corporate citizenship has always been fundamental and part of Unifiedpost‚Äôs DNA. The Company recognizes its responsibility to consider the impact of its business on the environment and society  and is committed to integrating sustainability into our business strategy. In 2022  the ESG-roadmap drawn up the year before  was further implemented and for the first time  data gathering across all entities was kicked off.Positive cash flow expected for H2 2023[INSIDE INFORMATION] In 2023 and the years ahead Group management expects to significantly benefit from the growth in its key markets. The mandatory digital e-invoicing policies several European countries have implemented and will implement will have a positive effect on customers and revenue. With the changed economic circumstances and business conditions  the Company has decided to make the target to become cash flow positive its only target. The target remains to be cash flow positive for H2 2023.<End>The auditor  BDO R√©viseurs d‚ÄôEntreprises SRL  has confirmed that audit of the consolidated financial information for the year ended 31 December 2022 as included in this press release is substantially completed.Investors & Media webcastManagement will host a live video webcast for analysts  investors and media today at 10:00 a.m. CET.A recording will be available shortly after the event.
