The acceptance of the Tender Offer must be submitted separately for each book-entry account. A shareholder of Caverion submitting an acceptance must have a cash account with a financial institution operating in Finland or abroad (see also ""‚Äî Terms of Payment and Settlement"" and ""Important Information""). Shareholders may only accept the Tender Offer unconditionally and for all Shares that are held on the book-entry accounts mentioned in the acceptance at the time of the execution of the transaction with respect to the Shares of such shareholder. Acceptances submitted during the Offer Period are valid also until the expiration of an extended or discontinued Offer Period  if any.Most Finnish account operators are expected to send a notice regarding the Tender Offer and related instructions to those who are registered as shareholders in the shareholders' register of Caverion maintained by Euroclear Finland. Shareholders of Caverion who do not receive such instructions from their account operator or asset manager should first contact their account operator or asset manager and can subsequently contact Danske Bank A/S  Finland Branch (""Danske Bank"") by sending an email to caverion-offer@danskebank.com  where such shareholders of Caverion can receive information on submitting their acceptance of the Tender Offer  or  if such shareholders are U.S. residents or located within the United States  they may contact their brokers for the necessary information.Those shareholders of Caverion whose Shares are nominee-registered  and who wish to accept the Tender Offer  must effect such acceptance in accordance with the instructions given by the custodian of the nominee-registered shareholders. The Offeror will not send an acceptance form or any other documents related to the Tender Offer to these shareholders of Caverion.If the Shares held by a shareholder are pledged or otherwise subject to restrictions that prevent or limit the acceptance  the acceptance of the Tender Offer may require the consent of the pledgee or other beneficiary of a such restriction. If so  acquiring this consent is the responsibility of the relevant shareholder of Caverion. Such consent must be delivered in writing to the account operator.A shareholder of Caverion who is registered as a shareholder in the shareholders' register of Caverion and who wishes to accept the Tender Offer shall submit a properly completed and duly executed acceptance form to the account operator managing the shareholder's book-entry account in accordance with its instructions and within the time limit set by the account operator  which may be prior to the expiry of the Offer Period or the Subsequent Offer Period or  in the case such account operator does not accept acceptance notifications  such shareholder shall primarily contact his/her/its own bank to give his/her/its acceptance to tender his/her/its Shares  or secondarily contact Danske Bank by sending an email to caverion-offer@danskebank.com for further information.Any acceptance must be submitted in such a manner that it will be received within the Offer Period (including any extended or discontinued Offer Period) taking into account  however  the instructions given by the relevant account operator. In the event of a Subsequent Offer Period  the acceptance must be submitted so that it is received during the Subsequent Offer Period  subject to and in accordance with the instructions of the relevant account operator. The account operator may request the receipt of acceptances prior to the expiration of the Offer Period and/or Subsequent Offer Period. Shareholders of Caverion submit acceptances at their own risk. Any acceptance will be considered as submitted only when an account operator has actually received it. The Offeror reserves the right to reject or approve  in its sole discretion  any acceptance submitted outside the Offer Period (or any Subsequent Offer Period  as applicable) or in an incorrect or incomplete manner. The Offeror may  in its sole discretion  also reject any partial tender of the Shares per book-entry account.A shareholder who has validly accepted the Tender Offer in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Tender Offer may not sell or otherwise transfer his/her tendered Shares. By accepting the Tender Offer  the shareholders authorise their account operator to enter into their book-entry account a sales reservation or a restriction on the right of disposal in the manner set out in ""‚Äî Technical Completion of the Tender Offer"" below after the shareholder has delivered the acceptance with respect to the Shares. Furthermore  the shareholders of Caverion that accept the Tender Offer authorise their account operator to perform necessary entries and undertake any other measures needed for the technical execution of the Tender Offer  and to sell all the Shares held by the shareholder of Caverion at the time of the execution of trades under the Tender Offer to the Offeror in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Tender Offer. In connection with the completion trades of the Tender Offer or the settlement thereof  the sales reservation or the restriction on the right of disposal will be removed and the Offer Price will be transferred to the relevant shareholders of Caverion.By accepting the Tender Offer  the accepting shareholder authorises his/her depository participant to disclose the necessary personal data  the number of his/her book-entry account and the details of the acceptance to the parties involved in the order or the execution of the order and settlement of the Shares.Those shareholders of Caverion who have already accepted the Bain Capital Offer must  in order to accept the Tender Offer  first withdraw their acceptance of the Bain Capital Offer in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Bain Capital Offer.Right of Withdrawal of AcceptanceAn acceptance of the Tender Offer may be withdrawn by a shareholder of Caverion at any time before the expiration of the Offer Period (including any extended or discontinued Offer Period) until the Offeror has announced that all Conditions to Completion have been fulfilled or waived by the Offeror  that is  the Offeror has declared the Tender Offer unconditional. After such announcement  the Shares already tendered may not be withdrawn. Notwithstanding the foregoing  shareholders of Caverion may withdraw their acceptance until the end of the Offer Period if a competing public tender offer for the Shares is announced by a third party and the execution of the completion trades of the Shares has not taken place as set out under ""‚Äî Completion of the Tender Offer"".A valid withdrawal of an acceptance of the Tender Offer requires that a withdrawal notification is submitted in writing to the account operator to whom the original acceptance was submitted.For nominee-registered Shares  the shareholders must request the relevant custodian of the nominee-registered shareholder to execute a withdrawal notification.If a shareholder of Caverion validly withdraws an acceptance of the Tender Offer  the sales reservation or the restriction on the right of disposal with respect to Shares will be removed within three (3) Finnish banking days of the receipt of a withdrawal notification.A shareholder of Caverion who has validly withdrawn its acceptance of the Tender Offer may accept the Tender Offer again during the Offer Period (including any extended or discontinued Offer Period) or during the Subsequent Offer Period  if any  by following the procedure set out under ""‚Äî Acceptance Procedure of the Tender Offer"" above.A shareholder of Caverion who withdraws its acceptance of the Tender Offer is obligated to pay any fees that the account operator operating the relevant book-entry account or the custodial nominee of a nominee-registered holding may collect for the withdrawal. In accordance with the FIN-FSA Regulations and Guidelines  if a competing offer has been announced or a previously announced competing offer is improved during the Offer Period and the completion of the Tender Offer has not taken place  neither the Offeror nor Danske Bank (in its capacity as arranger) will charge the shareholders for validly withdrawing their acceptance in such a situation.In the event of a Subsequent Offer Period  the acceptance of the Tender Offer will be binding and cannot be withdrawn  unless otherwise provided under mandatory law.Technical Completion of the Tender OfferWhen an account operator has received the properly completed and duly executed acceptance or acceptance otherwise approved by the Offeror with respect to the Shares in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Tender Offer  the account operator will enter a sales reservation or a restriction on the right of disposal into the relevant shareholder's book-entry account. In connection with the completion trades of the Tender Offer or the settlement thereof  the sales reservation or the restrictions on the right of disposal will be removed and the Offer Price will be paid to the relevant shareholder.Announcement of the Result of the Tender OfferThe preliminary result of the Tender Offer will be announced on or about the first (1st) Finnish banking day following the expiration of the Offer Period (including any extended or discontinued Offer Period).

The final result of the Tender Offer will be announced on or about the third (3rd) Finnish banking day following the expiration of the Offer Period (including any extended or discontinued Offer Period) at the latest. The announcement of the final result will confirm (i) the percentage of the Shares that have been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn and (ii) whether the Tender Offer will be completed.In the event of a Subsequent Offer Period  the Offeror will announce the initial percentage of the Shares validly tendered during the Subsequent Offer Period on or about the first (1st) Finnish banking day following the expiry of the Subsequent Offer Period and the final percentage on or about the third (3rd) Finnish banking day following the expiry of the Subsequent Offer Period.Completion of the Tender OfferThe completion trades of the Tender Offer will be executed with respect to all of those Shares that have been validly tendered  and not validly withdrawn  into the Tender Offer no later than on the fifteenth (15th) Finnish banking day following the announcement of the final result of the Tender Offer (the ""Completion Date""). If possible  the completion trades of the Shares will be executed on Nasdaq Helsinki  provided that such execution is allowed under the rules applied to trading on Nasdaq Helsinki. Otherwise  the completion trades will be made outside Nasdaq Helsinki. The completion trades of the Shares will be settled on the Completion Date or on or about the first (1st) Finnish banking day following the Completion Date (the ""Settlement Date"").Terms of Payment and SettlementThe Offer Price will be paid on the Settlement Date to each shareholder of Caverion who has validly accepted  and not validly withdrawn  the Tender Offer into the management account of the shareholder's book-entry account or  in the case of shareholders whose holdings are registered in the name of a nominee  into the bank account specified by the custodian or nominee. In any case  the Offer Price will not be paid to a bank account situated in Australia  Canada  the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China  Japan  New Zealand or South Africa or any other jurisdiction where the Tender Offer is not being made (see section ""Important Information""). If the management account of a shareholder of Caverion is with a different financial institution than the applicable book-entry account  the Offer Price will be paid into such cash account approximately two (2) Finnish banking days later in accordance with the schedule for payment transactions between financial institutions.In the event of a Subsequent Offer Period  the Offeror will in connection with the announcement thereof announce the terms of payment and settlement for the Shares tendered during the Subsequent Offer Period. After the Completion Date  the completion trades with respect to Shares validly tendered and accepted in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Tender Offer during the Subsequent Offer Period will  however  be executed within not more than two (2) week intervals.The Offeror reserves the right to postpone the payment of the Offer Price if payment is prevented or suspended due to a force majeure event but will immediately effect such payment once the force majeure event preventing or suspending payment is resolved. In addition  the Offeror reserves the right to withhold the payment of the Offer Price if payment is prevented or prohibited due to applicable sanctions laws or regulations and/or to rescind or terminate any acceptances if required by applicable sanctions laws or regulations. Unless the relevant acceptance is rescinded or terminated  the Offeror shall without delay effect the payment of the Offer Price once it is no longer prevented or prohibited due to applicable sanctions laws or regulations.If all the Conditions to Completion are not met and the Offeror does not waive such conditions or extend the Offer Period  the Tender Offer will expire  and no consideration will be paid for the tendered Shares.Transfer of TitleTitle to the Shares in respect of which the Tender Offer has been validly accepted  and not validly withdrawn  will pass to the Offeror on the Settlement Date against the payment of the Offer Price by the Offeror to the tendering shareholder.

Each shareholder is urged to consult with an independent professional adviser regarding the tax consequences of accepting the Tender Offer.Other MattersThe Tender Offer Document and the Tender Offer are governed by Finnish law. Any disputes arising out of or in connection with the Tender Offer will be settled by a court of competent jurisdiction in Finland.The Offeror reserves the right to amend the terms and conditions of the Tender Offer in accordance with Chapter 11  Section 15 of the Finnish Securities Markets Act.

This does not mean that a person who accepts the Tender Offer (the ""Participant"") will be regarded as a customer of Danske Bank as a result of such acceptance. A Participant will be regarded as a customer only if Danske Bank has provided advice to the Participant or has otherwise contacted the Participant personally regarding the Tender Offer. If the Participant is not regarded as a customer  the investor protection rules under the Finnish Act on Investment Services (747/2012  as amended) will not apply to the acceptance. This means  among other things  that neither the so-called customer categorization nor the so-called appropriateness test will be performed with respect to the Tender Offer. Each Participant is therefore responsible for ensuring that it has sufficient experience and knowledge to understand the risks associated with the Tender Offer.Important Information regarding NID and LEIAccording to Directive 2014/65/EU on markets in financial instruments (MiFID II)  all investors must have a global identification code from 3 January 2018  in order to carry out a securities transaction. These requirements require legal entities to apply for registration of a Legal Entity Identifier (""LEI"") code  and natural persons need to state their NID (National ID or National Client Identifier) when accepting the Tender Offer. Each person's legal status determines whether a LEI code or NID number is required  and the book-entry account operator may be prevented from performing the transaction to any person if LEI or NID number is not provided. Legal persons who need to obtain a LEI code can contact the relevant authority or one of the suppliers available on the market. Those who intend to accept the Tender Offer are encouraged to apply for registration of a LEI code (legal persons) or to acquire their NID number (natural persons) well in advance  as this information is required in the acceptance at the time of submission.Information regarding Processing of Personal DataShareholders who accept the Tender Offer will submit personal data  such as name  address and social security number  to Danske Bank  which is the controller for the processing of such data. Personal data provided to Danske Bank will be processed in data systems to the extent required to administer the Tender Offer.

Personal data may also be processed in the data systems of companies with which Danske Bank cooperates and it may be disclosed to the Offeror to the extent necessary for administering the Tender Offer.

All obligations of the Issuer under the Securities (except for the CSO Obligations  if any) shall be irrevocably and automatically released in consideration of the Issuer's issuance of the Conversion Shares to the Conversion Shares Depository (or other relevant recipient as described herein) on the Conversion Date. IMPORTANT-PRIIPs REGULATION / PROHIBITION OF SALES TO EEA RETAIL INVESTORS. The Securities are not intended to be offered  sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered  sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (""EEA""). For these purposes  a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended  ""MiFID II""); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (the ""Insurance Distribution Directive"")  where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II. Consequently  no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended  the ""PRIIPs Regulation"") for offering or selling the Securities or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Securities or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

This does not mean that a person who accepts the Tender Offer (the ""Participant"") will be regarded as a customer of Danske Bank as a result of such acceptance. A Participant will be regarded as a customer only if Danske Bank has provided advice to the Participant or has otherwise contacted the Participant personally regarding the Tender Offer.

The Board considers the proposed payment of dividend justified. MuniFin clearly fulfils all the prudential requirements set to it. No substantial changes in the company‚Äôs financial position have occurred after the end of the financial year and the Board estimates that the distribution of dividends will not place the fulfilment of the capital requirements or the company's liquidity in jeopardy nor is it incompatible with the legislation applicable to MuniFin.The dividends will be paid to shareholders who are recorded in the company's list of shareholders on 4 April 2023. The Board proposes that the dividends be paid on 13 April 2023.Remuneration and composition of the BoardThe Nomination Committee proposes to the AGM the following remuneration of the Board for the term from the closing of the 2023 AGM to the closing of the next AGM (the Term 2023‚Äì2024):annual fixed remuneration of a Board member EUR 24 000;annual fixed remuneration of the Vice Chair of the Board EUR 27 500;annual fixed remuneration of the Chair of the Risk or Audit Committee EUR 29 500;annual fixed remuneration of the Chair of the Board EUR 42 000; andfor each Board and committee meeting as well as for each meeting required by the authorities  to the members  a fee of EUR 600 per meeting attended and to the chairs  EUR 950 per meeting attended.The proposed remuneration means an increase of EUR 2 000 to the annual fixed remuneration of the Chair of the Board  an increase of EUR 1 500 to the annual fixed remuneration of the Vice Chair of the Board and the Chairs of the Risk and Audit Committees and an increase of EUR 1 000 to the annual fixed remuneration of a Board member.

Acceptances submitted during the Offer Period are valid also until the expiration of an extended or discontinued Offer Period  if any.Most Finnish account operators are expected to send a notice regarding the Tender Offer and related instructions to those who are registered as shareholders in the shareholders' register of Caverion maintained by Euroclear Finland. Shareholders of Caverion who do not receive such instructions from their account operator or asset manager should first contact their account operator or asset manager and can subsequently contact Danske Bank A/S  Finland Branch (""Danske Bank"") by sending an email to [email protected]  where such shareholders of Caverion can receive information on submitting their acceptance of the Tender Offer  or  if such shareholders are U.S. residents or located within the United States  they may contact their brokers for the necessary information.Those shareholders of Caverion whose Shares are nominee-registered  and who wish to accept the Tender Offer  must effect such acceptance in accordance with the instructions given by the custodian of the nominee-registered shareholders. The Offeror will not send an acceptance form or any other documents related to the Tender Offer to these shareholders of Caverion.If the Shares held by a shareholder are pledged or otherwise subject to restrictions that prevent or limit the acceptance  the acceptance of the Tender Offer may require the consent of the pledgee or other beneficiary of a such restriction. If so  acquiring this consent is the responsibility of the relevant shareholder of Caverion. Such consent must be delivered in writing to the account operator.A shareholder of Caverion who is registered as a shareholder in the shareholders' register of Caverion and who wishes to accept the Tender Offer shall submit a properly completed and duly executed acceptance form to the account operator managing the shareholder's book-entry account in accordance with its instructions and within the time limit set by the account operator  which may be prior to the expiry of the Offer Period or the Subsequent Offer Period or  in the case such account operator does not accept acceptance notifications  such shareholder shall primarily contact his/her/its own bank to give his/her/its acceptance to tender his/her/its Shares  or secondarily contact Danske Bank by sending an email to [email protected] for further information.Any acceptance must be submitted in such a manner that it will be received within the Offer Period (including any extended or discontinued Offer Period) taking into account  however  the instructions given by the relevant account operator. In the event of a Subsequent Offer Period  the acceptance must be submitted so that it is received during the Subsequent Offer Period  subject to and in accordance with the instructions of the relevant account operator. The account operator may request the receipt of acceptances prior to the expiration of the Offer Period and/or Subsequent Offer Period. Shareholders of Caverion submit acceptances at their own risk. Any acceptance will be considered as submitted only when an account operator has actually received it. The Offeror reserves the right to reject or approve  in its sole discretion  any acceptance submitted outside the Offer Period (or any Subsequent Offer Period  as applicable) or in an incorrect or incomplete manner. The Offeror may  in its sole discretion  also reject any partial tender of the Shares per book-entry account.A shareholder who has validly accepted the Tender Offer in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Tender Offer may not sell or otherwise transfer his/her tendered Shares. By accepting the Tender Offer  the shareholders authorise their account operator to enter into their book-entry account a sales reservation or a restriction on the right of disposal in the manner set out in ""‚Äî Technical Completion of the Tender Offer"" below after the shareholder has delivered the acceptance with respect to the Shares. Furthermore  the shareholders of Caverion that accept the Tender Offer authorise their account operator to perform necessary entries and undertake any other measures needed for the technical execution of the Tender Offer  and to sell all the Shares held by the shareholder of Caverion at the time of the execution of trades under the Tender Offer to the Offeror in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Tender Offer. In connection with the completion trades of the Tender Offer or the settlement thereof  the sales reservation or the restriction on the right of disposal will be removed and the Offer Price will be transferred to the relevant shareholders of Caverion.By accepting the Tender Offer  the accepting shareholder authorises his/her depository participant to disclose the necessary personal data  the number of his/her book-entry account and the details of the acceptance to the parties involved in the order or the execution of the order and settlement of the Shares.Those shareholders of Caverion who have already accepted the Bain Capital Offer must  in order to accept the Tender Offer  first withdraw their acceptance of the Bain Capital Offer in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Bain Capital Offer.Right of Withdrawal of AcceptanceAn acceptance of the Tender Offer may be withdrawn by a shareholder of Caverion at any time before the expiration of the Offer Period (including any extended or discontinued Offer Period) until the Offeror has announced that all Conditions to Completion have been fulfilled or waived by the Offeror  that is  the Offeror has declared the Tender Offer unconditional. After such announcement  the Shares already tendered may not be withdrawn. Notwithstanding the foregoing  shareholders of Caverion may withdraw their acceptance until the end of the Offer Period if a competing public tender offer for the Shares is announced by a third party and the execution of the completion trades of the Shares has not taken place as set out under ""‚Äî Completion of the Tender Offer"".A valid withdrawal of an acceptance of the Tender Offer requires that a withdrawal notification is submitted in writing to the account operator to whom the original acceptance was submitted.For nominee-registered Shares  the shareholders must request the relevant custodian of the nominee-registered shareholder to execute a withdrawal notification.If a shareholder of Caverion validly withdraws an acceptance of the Tender Offer  the sales reservation or the restriction on the right of disposal with respect to Shares will be removed within three (3) Finnish banking days of the receipt of a withdrawal notification.A shareholder of Caverion who has validly withdrawn its acceptance of the Tender Offer may accept the Tender Offer again during the Offer Period (including any extended or discontinued Offer Period) or during the Subsequent Offer Period  if any  by following the procedure set out under ""‚Äî Acceptance Procedure of the Tender Offer"" above.A shareholder of Caverion who withdraws its acceptance of the Tender Offer is obligated to pay any fees that the account operator operating the relevant book-entry account or the custodial nominee of a nominee-registered holding may collect for the withdrawal. In accordance with the FIN-FSA Regulations and Guidelines  if a competing offer has been announced or a previously announced competing offer is improved during the Offer Period and the completion of the Tender Offer has not taken place  neither the Offeror nor Danske Bank (in its capacity as arranger) will charge the shareholders for validly withdrawing their acceptance in such a situation.In the event of a Subsequent Offer Period  the acceptance of the Tender Offer will be binding and cannot be withdrawn  unless otherwise provided under mandatory law.Technical Completion of the Tender OfferWhen an account operator has received the properly completed and duly executed acceptance or acceptance otherwise approved by the Offeror with respect to the Shares in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Tender Offer  the account operator will enter a sales reservation or a restriction on the right of disposal into the relevant shareholder's book-entry account. In connection with the completion trades of the Tender Offer or the settlement thereof  the sales reservation or the restrictions on the right of disposal will be removed and the Offer Price will be paid to the relevant shareholder.Announcement of the Result of the Tender OfferThe preliminary result of the Tender Offer will be announced on or about the first (1st) Finnish banking day following the expiration of the Offer Period (including any extended or discontinued Offer Period). In connection with the announcement of such preliminary result  it will be announced whether the Tender Offer will be completed subject to the Conditions to Completion being fulfilled or waived on the date of the final result announcement and whether the Offer Period will be extended. The final result of the Tender Offer will be announced on or about the third (3rd) Finnish banking day following the expiration of the Offer Period (including any extended or discontinued Offer Period) at the latest. The announcement of the final result will confirm (i) the percentage of the Shares that have been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn and (ii) whether the Tender Offer will be completed.In the event of a Subsequent Offer Period  the Offeror will announce the initial percentage of the Shares validly tendered during the Subsequent Offer Period on or about the first (1st) Finnish banking day following the expiry of the Subsequent Offer Period and the final percentage on or about the third (3rd) Finnish banking day following the expiry of the Subsequent Offer Period.Completion of the Tender OfferThe completion trades of the Tender Offer will be executed with respect to all of those Shares that have been validly tendered  and not validly withdrawn  into the Tender Offer no later than on the fifteenth (15th) Finnish banking day following the announcement of the final result of the Tender Offer (the ""Completion Date""). If possible  the completion trades of the Shares will be executed on Nasdaq Helsinki  provided that such execution is allowed under the rules applied to trading on Nasdaq Helsinki. Otherwise  the completion trades will be made outside Nasdaq Helsinki. The completion trades of the Shares will be settled on the Completion Date or on or about the first (1st) Finnish banking day following the Completion Date (the ""Settlement Date"").Terms of Payment and SettlementThe Offer Price will be paid on the Settlement Date to each shareholder of Caverion who has validly accepted  and not validly withdrawn  the Tender Offer into the management account of the shareholder's book-entry account or  in the case of shareholders whose holdings are registered in the name of a nominee  into the bank account specified by the custodian or nominee. In any case  the Offer Price will not be paid to a bank account situated in Australia  Canada  the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China  Japan  New Zealand or South Africa or any other jurisdiction where the Tender Offer is not being made (see section ""Important Information""). If the management account of a shareholder of Caverion is with a different financial institution than the applicable book-entry account  the Offer Price will be paid into such cash account approximately two (2) Finnish banking days later in accordance with the schedule for payment transactions between financial institutions.In the event of a Subsequent Offer Period  the Offeror will in connection with the announcement thereof announce the terms of payment and settlement for the Shares tendered during the Subsequent Offer Period. After the Completion Date  the completion trades with respect to Shares validly tendered and accepted in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Tender Offer during the Subsequent Offer Period will  however  be executed within not more than two (2) week intervals.The Offeror reserves the right to postpone the payment of the Offer Price if payment is prevented or suspended due to a force majeure event but will immediately effect such payment once the force majeure event preventing or suspending payment is resolved. In addition  the Offeror reserves the right to withhold the payment of the Offer Price if payment is prevented or prohibited due to applicable sanctions laws or regulations and/or to rescind or terminate any acceptances if required by applicable sanctions laws or regulations. Unless the relevant acceptance is rescinded or terminated  the Offeror shall without delay effect the payment of the Offer Price once it is no longer prevented or prohibited due to applicable sanctions laws or regulations.If all the Conditions to Completion are not met and the Offeror does not waive such conditions or extend the Offer Period  the Tender Offer will expire  and no consideration will be paid for the tendered Shares.Transfer of TitleTitle to the Shares in respect of which the Tender Offer has been validly accepted  and not validly withdrawn  will pass to the Offeror on the Settlement Date against the payment of the Offer Price by the Offeror to the tendering shareholder. In the event of a Subsequent Offer Period  title to the Shares in respect of which the Tender Offer has been validly accepted during a Subsequent Offer Period will pass to the Offeror on the relevant settlement date against the payment of the Offer Price by the Offeror to the tendering shareholder.Transfer Tax and Other PaymentsThe Offeror will pay any transfer tax that may be charged in Finland in connection with the sale of the Shares pursuant to the Tender Offer.Fees charged by account operators  asset managers  nominees or any other person for the release of collateral or the revoking of any other restrictions preventing the sale of the Shares  will be borne by each relevant shareholder of Caverion. Each shareholder of Caverion is liable for any fees that relate to a withdrawal of an acceptance made by such shareholder.The Offeror is liable for any other customary costs caused by the registration of entries in the book-entry system required by the Tender Offer  the execution of trades pertaining to the Shares pursuant to the Tender Offer and the payment of the Offer Price.The receipt of cash pursuant to the Tender Offer by a shareholder may be a taxable transaction for the respective shareholder under applicable tax laws  including those of the country of residency of the shareholder. Any tax liability arising to a shareholder from the receipt of cash pursuant to the Tender Offer will be borne by such shareholder. Each shareholder is urged to consult with an independent professional adviser regarding the tax consequences of accepting the Tender Offer.Other MattersThe Tender Offer Document and the Tender Offer are governed by Finnish law. Any disputes arising out of or in connection with the Tender Offer will be settled by a court of competent jurisdiction in Finland.The Offeror reserves the right to amend the terms and conditions of the Tender Offer in accordance with Chapter 11  Section 15 of the Finnish Securities Markets Act. Should the FIN-FSA issue an order regarding an extension of the Offer Period  the Offeror reserves the right to decide upon the withdrawal of the Tender Offer in accordance with Chapter 11  Section 12 of the Finnish Securities Markets Act.Should a competing public tender offer for the shares in the Company be announced by a third party or should the Bain Capital Offer be further improved  in each case prior to or during the Offer Period  the Offeror reserves the right to (i) if the Offer Period has commenced  extend the Offer Period  (ii) amend the terms and conditions of the Tender Offer  and (iii) decide before the expiration of the competing public tender offer or the Bain Capital Offer  to withdraw the Tender Offer or let the Tender Offer lapse.The Offeror may acquire  or enter into arrangements to acquire  Shares  or arrange ownership of Shares before  during and/or after the Offer Period (including any extension thereof and any Subsequent Offer Period) in public trading on Nasdaq Helsinki or otherwise outside the Tender Offer  to the extent permitted by applicable laws and regulations.Other InformationDanske Bank acts as arranger in relation to the Tender Offer  which means that it performs certain administrative services relating to the Tender Offer. This does not mean that a person who accepts the Tender Offer (the ""Participant"") will be regarded as a customer of Danske Bank as a result of such acceptance. A Participant will be regarded as a customer only if Danske Bank has provided advice to the Participant or has otherwise contacted the Participant personally regarding the Tender Offer. If the Participant is not regarded as a customer  the investor protection rules under the Finnish Act on Investment Services (747/2012  as amended) will not apply to the acceptance. This means  among other things  that neither the so-called customer categorization nor the so-called appropriateness test will be performed with respect to the Tender Offer. Each Participant is therefore responsible for ensuring that it has sufficient experience and knowledge to understand the risks associated with the Tender Offer.Important Information regarding NID and LEIAccording to Directive 2014/65/EU on markets in financial instruments (MiFID II)  all investors must have a global identification code from 3 January 2018  in order to carry out a securities transaction. These requirements require legal entities to apply for registration of a Legal Entity Identifier (""LEI"") code  and natural persons need to state their NID (National ID or National Client Identifier) when accepting the Tender Offer. Each person's legal status determines whether a LEI code or NID number is required  and the book-entry account operator may be prevented from performing the transaction to any person if LEI or NID number is not provided. Legal persons who need to obtain a LEI code can contact the relevant authority or one of the suppliers available on the market. Those who intend to accept the Tender Offer are encouraged to apply for registration of a LEI code (legal persons) or to acquire their NID number (natural persons) well in advance  as this information is required in the acceptance at the time of submission.Information regarding Processing of Personal DataShareholders who accept the Tender Offer will submit personal data  such as name  address and social security number  to Danske Bank  which is the controller for the processing of such data. Personal data provided to Danske Bank will be processed in data systems to the extent required to administer the Tender Offer. Personal data obtained from sources other than the customer may also be processed. Personal data may also be processed in the data systems of companies with which Danske Bank cooperates and it may be disclosed to the Offeror to the extent necessary for administering the Tender Offer. Address details may be obtained by Danske Bank through an automatic procedure executed by Euroclear Finland. Additional information on processing of personal data by Danske Bank  including details on how to exercise data subjects' rights  may be found at www.danskebank.com.The following files are available for download:https://mb.cision.com/Public/22099/3729077/a2efb76e8e4376c4.pdf Release - 7 March 2023 ENGSOURCE Crayfish BidCo Oy",neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,True,English,"['VOLUNTARY PUBLIC CASH TENDER OFFER', 'CRAYFISH BIDCO', 'CAVERION CORPORATION', 'ALL', 'SHARES', '8 MARCH', 'The Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority', 'Finnish private limited liability company', 'voluntary public cash tender offer', 'Most Finnish account operators', 'other necessary regulatory approvals', 'financial statements release', 'Finnish language version', 'Finnish Companies Act', 'Crayfish BidCo Oy', 'English language translation', 'Annual General Meeting', 'merger control clearance', 'U.S. residents', 'other similar transaction', 'Stock Exchange Release', 'Euroclear Finland Ltd', 'The Tender Offer', 'The Offer Price', 'Danske Bank A/S', 'tender offer document', 'Triton Fund V', 'initial Offer Period', 'extended offer period', 'new share issue', 'Finnish time', 'other assets', 'stock split', 'Finland Branch', 'necessary information', 'other Shares', 'applicable laws', 'fourth quarter', 'possible extension', 'reverse split', 'euro basis', 'ninety (90) percent', 'voting rights', 'asset manager', 'United States', 'record date', 'acceptance period', 'completion trades', 'final result', 'related instructions', 'outstanding shares', 'customary conditions', ""shareholders' register"", 'Caverion Corporation', '7 March', 'HELSINKI', 'PRNewswire', '10 January', 'Offeror', 'entities', 'subsidiaries', '24 February', '8 March', '9:30 a', '17 May', 'accordance', 'terms', 'regulations', 'order', 'third', 'way', 'internet', 'triton-offer', '136,472,645 issued', 'number', 'reclassification', 'funds', 'respect', 'foregoing', 'settlements', 'expiry', '9 February', 'connection', 'Board', 'Directors', 'year', 'distribution', 'satisfaction', 'waiver', 'announcement', 'others', 'Chapter', 'Section', 'notice', 'email', 'brokers', '6:30', '4:00']",2023-03-07,2023-03-08,prnewswire.com

From (and including) the Issue Date (as defined herein) to (but excluding) March 15  2029 (such date and each fifth (5th) anniversary thereafter being a ""Reset Date"")  the interest rate on the Securities will be 9.250% per annum. From (and including) each Reset Date to (but excluding) the next following Reset Date  the applicable per annum interest rate will be equal to the sum  as determined by the Calculation Agent (as defined herein)  of the applicable Mid-Market Swap Rate (as defined herein) on the relevant Reset Determination Date (as defined herein) and 5.639%  converted to a quarterly rate in accordance with market convention as instructed by the Issuer (rounded to three decimal places  with 0.0005 rounded down). The interest rate following any Reset Date may be less than the initial interest rate and/or the interest rate that applies immediately prior to such Reset Date. Subject to the conditions described herein  interest  if any  will be payable quarterly in arrear on March 15  June 15  September 15 and December 15 of each year (each  an ""Interest Payment Date"")  commencing on June 15  2023. We will apply to the London Stock Exchange plc (the ""LSE"") for the Securities to be admitted to trading on the LSE's International Securities Market (the ""ISM""). The ISM is not a regulated market for the purposes of MiFID II or U.K. MiFIR (each as defined herein). The ISM is a market designated for professional investors. Securities admitted to trading on the ISM are not admitted to the Official List of the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the ""FCA""). The LSE has not approved or verified the contents of either this prospectus supplement or the accompanying prospectus. Neither this prospectus supplement nor the accompanying prospectus comprises (i) a prospectus or listing particulars for the purposes of Part VI of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000  as amended (the ""FSMA"") or (ii) a prospectus for the purposes of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 or Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of domestic law of the United Kingdom (""U.K."") by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (the ""Withdrawal Act""). As described in this prospectus supplement  the terms of the Securities provide that interest on the Securities will be due and payable only at the sole discretion of the Issuer  and the Issuer shall have sole and absolute discretion at all times and for any reason to cancel (in whole or in part) any interest payment that would otherwise be payable on any Interest Payment Date. As described herein  the terms of the Securities also provide for circumstances under which the Issuer shall be restricted from making an interest payment (in whole or in part) on the Securities on an Interest Payment Date  and the interest payable in respect of any such Interest Payment Date shall be deemed cancelled (in whole or in part) and therefore not due and payable. Interest will only be due and payable on an Interest Payment Date to the extent it is not cancelled or deemed cancelled in accordance with the terms of the Securities and as further described herein. Any interest cancelled or deemed cancelled (in each case  in whole or in part) in accordance with the terms of the Securities and as further described herein shall not be due and shall not accumulate or be payable at any time thereafter  and holders of the Securities shall have no rights thereto or to receive any additional interest or compensation as a result of such cancellation or deemed cancellation. The Securities are perpetual and have no fixed maturity or fixed redemption date. As a result of the fact that the Securities are perpetual securities and that interest on the Securities will be due and payable only at our sole discretion and that we may cancel (in whole or in part) any interest payment at any time  we are not required to make any payment of the principal amount of the Securities at any time prior to our winding-up or administration and you may not receive interest on any Interest Payment Date. The Securities will constitute our direct  unsecured and subordinated obligations  ranking pari passu without any preference among themselves  as described herein. The Securities will be in registered form in minimum denominations of ¬£200 000 and in integral multiples of ¬£1 000 in excess thereof. As described herein  we may  at our option  redeem the Securities  in whole but not in part  on (i) any day falling in the period commencing on (and including) September 15  2028 and ending on (and including) the first Reset Date or (ii) any day falling in the period commencing on (and including) the date that is six months before any subsequent Reset Date and ending on (and including) such Reset Date at 100% of their principal amount  together with any accrued but unpaid interest (which excludes any interest cancelled or deemed cancelled as described herein) to (but excluding) the date fixed for redemption. As described herein  we may also  at our option  redeem the Securities  in whole but not in part  at any time in the event of a change in certain U.K. regulatory capital requirements or upon the occurrence of certain tax events as described herein at 100% of their principal amount  together with any accrued but unpaid interest (which excludes any interest cancelled or deemed cancelled as described herein) to (but excluding) the date fixed for redemption. If a Capital Adequacy Trigger Event (as defined herein) occurs  then an Automatic Conversion (as defined herein) will occur on the Conversion Date (as defined herein)  at which point all of the Issuer's obligations under the Securities (other than certain Issuer obligations in connection with the Conversion Shares Offer (as defined herein)  if any  which are referred to herein as the CSO Obligations) shall be irrevocably and automatically released in consideration of the Issuer's issuance of the Conversion Shares (as defined herein) to the Conversion Shares Depository (as defined herein) (or other relevant recipient as described herein)  and under no circumstances shall such released obligations be reinstated. The Conversion Shares shall initially be registered in the name of the Conversion Shares Depository (which shall hold the Conversion Shares on behalf of the holders of the Securities) or the relevant recipient in accordance with the terms of Securities. As more fully described herein  the Issuer may elect  in its sole and absolute discretion  that a Conversion Shares Offer be made by the Conversion Shares Depository to all or some of the then existing shareholders of the Issuer. The realizable value of any Conversion Shares received by a holder of the Securities following an Automatic Conversion may be significantly less than the Conversion Price (as defined herein) of ¬£1.65 initially and holders of the Securities could lose all or part of their investment in the Securities as a result of the Automatic Conversion. Following an Automatic Conversion  the Securities shall remain in existence until the applicable Cancellation Date (as defined herein) for the sole purpose of evidencing (a) the holder's right to receive Conversion Shares or Conversion Shares Offer Consideration (as defined herein)  as applicable  from the Conversion Shares Depository and (b) the Issuer's CSO Obligations  if any. All obligations of the Issuer under the Securities (except for the CSO Obligations  if any) shall be irrevocably and automatically released in consideration of the Issuer's issuance of the Conversion Shares to the Conversion Shares Depository (or other relevant recipient as described herein) on the Conversion Date. IMPORTANT-PRIIPs REGULATION / PROHIBITION OF SALES TO EEA RETAIL INVESTORS. The Securities are not intended to be offered  sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered  sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (""EEA""). For these purposes  a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended  ""MiFID II""); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (the ""Insurance Distribution Directive"")  where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II. Consequently  no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended  the ""PRIIPs Regulation"") for offering or selling the Securities or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Securities or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation. IMPORTANT-U.K. PRIIPs REGULATION / PROHIBITION OF SALES TO U.K. RETAIL INVESTORS. The Securities are not intended to be offered  sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered  sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the U.K. For these purposes  a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client  as defined in point of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law of the U.K. by virtue of the Withdrawal Act; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97  where that customer would not qualify as a professional client  as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law of the U.K. by virtue of the Withdrawal Act (""U.K. MiFIR""). Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 as it forms part of domestic law of the U.K. by virtue of the Withdrawal Act (the ""U.K. PRIIPs Regulation"") for offering or selling the Securities or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the U.K. has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Securities or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the U.K. may be unlawful under the U.K. PRIIPs Regulation. In addition to the above  pursuant to the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority Conduct of Business Sourcebook (""COBS"") the Securities are not intended to be offered  sold or otherwise made available and should not be offered  sold or otherwise made available to retail clients (as defined in COBS 3.4) in the U.K. U.K. MIFIR PRODUCT GOVERNANCE / PROFESSIONAL INVESTORS AND ECPS ONLY TARGET MARKET-Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer's product approval process  the target market assessment in respect of the Securities has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Securities is only eligible counterparties  as defined in COBS  and professional clients  as defined in U.K. MiFIR; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Securities to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering  selling or recommending the Securities (a ""Distributor"") should take into consideration the manufacturers' target market assessment; however  a Distributor subject to the FCA Handbook Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook (the ""U.K. MiFIR Product Governance Rules"") is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Securities (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers' target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

One of the Group's objectives in 2023 is to complete at least one transaction during the year favoring a non-dilutive source of financing.""Bigger"" in terms of customer portfolio: One of Ekinops' growth priorities is its positioning with major international customers  to provide support in their strategic network and technological developments. This ambition will result in increased sales with existing key accounts and the acquisition of new major customers.Over time  Ekinops aims to be a reference brand in the telecom universe  working with the largest telecom operators worldwide.""Bigger"" in technological terms in Edge  Metro and the Cloud: in recent years  Ekinops has chosen to provide innovative  open and interoperable solutions for telecommunication networks. Transformation of the telecommunication market in recent years requires this type of technology  with:I. increasing levels of data processing at the edge of the network (Edge)  such as routing  voice  SD-WAN  etc.;II. a growing need for optimized optical transport solutions for metro networks (combining OTN and WDM);III. cloud solutions and platforms to manage and supervise networks and deliver new services such as PaaS (Platform as a Service).As a pioneer in virtualization  which can be used to uncouple software and platforms  and as a result of its commercial success in this technological segment  Ekinops intends  over the coming years  to become a major player in these three areas by supplying service providers with equipment and  increasingly  software and services that are regular and recurring sources of revenue.""Bigger"" in terms of ESG (Environmental  Social & Governance): To address the challenges of long-term value creation and in order to generate sustainable growth  Ekinops is intending to strengthen and accelerate its ESG actions that are focused on three key initiatives: (i) limiting the environmental impact of its business activities through energy efficient solutions ; (ii) becoming a leading and engaged employer to ESG  and (iii) acting as a responsible corporate citizen with its stakeholders.

(NASDAQ  Euronext Amsterdam: VEON) (‚ÄúVEON‚Äù or the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù)  a global digital operator that...,VEON Ltd.Amsterdam  Netherlands  7 March 2023 16:30 CET: VEON Ltd. (NASDAQ  Euronext Amsterdam: VEON) (‚ÄúVEON‚Äù or the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù)  a global digital operator that provides converged connectivity and online services  today provides an update on the timing of the ratio change under the Company‚Äôs ADR program  previously announced on 6 February 2023 and originally planned to become effective on 6 March 2023 (the ‚ÄúRatio Change‚Äù). As announced on 6 March 2023  the Company was informed late afternoon on Friday  3 March 2023 by BNY Mellon that the ratio change effectiveness had been postponed as The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (‚ÄúDTCC‚Äù) was not prepared to make the new CUSIP reflecting the new ratio available on Monday  6 March 2023 as scheduled. DTCC has now confirmed the availability of the new CUSIP  and the effective date of the Ratio Change (the ‚ÄúEffective Date‚Äù) is now confirmed as 8 March 2023.As previously announced with respect to the Ratio Change  as of the Effective Date  record holders who directly hold ADRs will be required to exchange their existing ADRs for new ADRs on the basis of one (1) new ADR for every twenty-five (25) existing ADRs surrendered. The Depositary will contact ADR holders and arrange for the exchange of their existing ADRs for new ADRs. American Depositary Share (‚ÄúADS‚Äù) beneficial holders who hold through an ADR holder intermediary need not take any action in connection with the Ratio Change.For ADS holders  the Ratio Change will have the same effect as a one for twenty five reverse ADS split. No new VEON common shares will be issued in connection with the Ratio Change and the ADSs will continue to be traded on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol ‚ÄúVEON.‚ÄùAs a result of the Ratio Change  the trading price of the Company‚Äôs ADSs is expected to automatically increase proportionally  but the Company can give no assurance that the ADS trading price following the Ratio Change will be at least equal to the ADS trading price before the Ratio Change multiplied by the new 25:1 ratio. As VEON announced previously on 5 October 2022  the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Market granted VEON an additional grace period through 3 April 2023 to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement set forth in Nasdaq‚Äôs Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the ‚ÄúMinimum Bid Price‚Äù). While the Ratio Change is intended to bring the bid price of the Company‚Äôs ADSs into compliance with the Minimum Bid Price  the Company can give no assurance that the Ratio Change will be effective in achieving this goal.Story continuesThe Company‚Äôs original announcement with respect to the ratio change can be found on the Company‚Äôs website at this address:https://www.veon.com/media/media-releases/2023/veon-announces-ratio-change-under-its-american-depositary-receipt-adr-program/About VEONVEON is a global digital operator that currently provides converged connectivity and online services to over 200 million customers in seven dynamic markets.

The VITESSE trial will use the modified Viaskin Peanut 250 Œºg patch and enroll 600 subjects  randomized 2:1 active versus placebo. The study will involve approximately 80 trial sites across the United States  Canada  Australia  and Europe. The primary efficacy endpoint of the study is the percentage of treatment responders in the active versus placebo arms at Month 12. Secondary efficacy endpoints include changes in cumulative reactive dose (CRD)  eliciting dose (ED) and severity of allergic reaction at Month 12 food challenge.‚ÄúI am pleased that the first trial participant has been screened in the VITESSE study ‚Äù said David Fleischer  MD  FAAAAI  FACAAI  Children‚Äôs Hospital Colorado and Global Principal Investigator for the VITESSE study  ‚ÄúThese peanut-allergic children represent a cohort of patients that are eagerly awaiting potential treatment options. I am looking forward to leading the team of highly skilled VITESSE investigators and their staff as we generate these critical data that may one day potentially support a BLA submission for Viaskin Peanut.‚ÄùStory continuesLast year  following productive exchanges with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  DBV finalized the VITESSE protocol and received the FDA‚Äôs support to advance the study. Previously  the FDA had requested changes to certain elements of the VITESSE protocol with the intent for the trial to support a future Biologics License Application (BLA).""The initiation of the VITESSE Phase 3 Study in peanut-allergic children ages 4 - 7 years represents a culmination of years of research and collaboration between DBV  FDA  patient groups  site investigators  trial centers  and  of course  the support and unwavering encouragement from food-allergic families ‚Äù said Pharis Mohideen  MD  Chief Medical Officer  DBV Technologies. ‚ÄúDBV is proud to see that patient screening has begun in Q1 2023.

I am grateful that peanut-allergic children have the opportunity to participate in a trial that may one day help other kids just like them living with peanut allergy. There is a lot of excitement around the VITESSE study  and I am proud our team will be an integral part of it.‚ÄùDBV anticipates screening the last patient in 1H 2024 and announcing topline results in 1H 2025.About VITESSEThe VITESSE trial will enroll 600 subjects  randomized 2:1 active versus placebo. The study will involve approximately 80 trial sites across the United States  Canada  Australia and Europe. Dr. David Fleischer  Colorado Children‚Äôs Hospital  will act as the global study Principal Investigator.The primary efficacy endpoint is the percentage of treatment responders in the active versus placebo arms at Month 12. The primary efficacy analysis includes the success criterion of a lower bound of the confidence interval of the difference in responder rates between active and placebo groups being greater than or equal to 15%.A treatment responder is defined as either a subject with a baseline ED ‚â§30 mg who reaches an ED ‚â•300 mg of peanut protein at Month 12  or a subject with a baseline ED = 100 mg who reaches an ED ‚â•600 mg of peanut protein at Month 12. A double-blind  placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) will be administered at baseline and Month 12 to determine a subject‚Äôs ED at both timepoints.During the screening period  subjects will undergo an initial visit with assessment for eligibility according to peanut skin prick test (SPT) and serum peanut IgE. Those meeting these criteria will proceed to a DBPCFC to confirm their peanut allergy and establish an entry peanut ED. The entry DBPCFC will be 1 mg peanut protein  and will escalate up to a highest single dose of 100 mg peanut protein. Subjects who react with an ED at or below the dose of 100 mg peanut protein and meet all other inclusion and no exclusion criteria are considered eligible. At Month 12  a post-treatment DBPCFC will be performed  with a starting dose of 3 mg peanut protein  escalating to a highest dose of 1 000 mg peanut protein according to the following schedule: 3  10  30  100  300  600  1 000 mg.

ANY FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THESE RESTRICTIONS MAY CONSTITUTE A VIOLATION OF APPLICABLE SECURITIES LAWSStatus of the proposed Business CombinationDCAC announced proposals to form a Business Combination with Advanced Cables on 20th February 2023. The DCAC Board today agreed to expedite the proposals  following confirmation from further governmental representatives of their in principle support  as well as the support of strategic co-investors. DCAC will therefore now agree an exclusive option to acquire the Target.A separate update is being formulated and will be circulated to DCAC Shareholders shortly.DCAC Shareholders and DCAC Warrant Holders are advised that  if completed and approved by DCAC Shareholders  the Business Combination may result in a material increase in the value of DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Warrants.Status of the Repurchase OfferCopies of the Repurchase Tender Document and the Stub Tender Offer Circular are available on DCAC's website: www.disruptivecapitalac.com .Under the Repurchase Offer (as defined and undertaken pursuant to the Repurchase Tender Document issued by the Company on 25 January 2023)  DCAC Ordinary Shareholders were eligible to submit tenders ahead of the final date for tenders to be submitted  being the 22 February 2023.DCAC Shareholders contemplating submitting a tender were made aware that  due to settlement and anti-money laundering processes  only valid tenders submitted in time for clearance would be considered for settlement and no tenders would be considered after 15:00 CET on 22 February 2023.Story continuesFurther  as was provided for in the Repurchase Tender Document  no tenders would be accepted by DCAC unless the tendering DCAC Shareholder demonstrated to the DCAC Board‚Äôs satisfaction that they were only tendering 95% of their holding; and were the holder of record of the DCAC Ordinary Shares being tendered as at the Record Date  so being on the Share Register at 17:40 CET on 10 February 2023.Inter alia  Clause 5.12 of the Repurchase Tender Document provides that:""All decisions as to the number of DCAC Ordinary Shares tendered and the validity or eligibility (including the time and date of receipt) of any tender of DCAC Ordinary Shares will be made by the Company. The Company‚Äôs decision shall be final and binding on all of the parties. The Company reserves the right to reject any or all tenders that it determines in its absolute discretion not to be in proper form and tendered in good faith; or the acceptance or payment for which may  in the sole opinion of the Company  be unlawful or in breach of sanctions or other such regulations. No tender of DCAC Ordinary Shares will be deemed to be validly made until all defects or irregularities have been cured or waived. The consideration under the Tender Offer will not be dispatched until the Company is duly satisfied. The decision of the Company as to which DCAC Ordinary Shares have been successfully tendered shall be final and binding on all DCAC Ordinary Shareholders.""As of 4 March 2023  tenders that were received purporting to cover 11 850 178 DCAC Ordinary Shares  including tenders submitted after the deadline in respect of 380 000 DCAC Ordinary SharesThe Company agreed to repurchase 10 820 564 DCAC Ordinary Shares  which have now been settled at a price of ¬£10.789 / DCAC Ordinary Share.The DCAC Board  its listing agent  administrators and lawyers have carefully reviewed and sought to reconcile the Tenders where there appeared to be discrepancies. It also discharged its promise to make due and careful enquiry of those that submitted those tenders. Whilst it has been difficult  costly and time consuming to reconcile tenders  the totality of tenders would have suggested that there were 440 901 more shares in public issue than was actually the case.Purported Repurchase Tenders for 1 029 614 DCAC Ordinary Shares were investigated by the DCAC Board as being potentially invalid.The DCAC Board is mindful of its duty of care to all DCAC Shareholders  and to make sure that that the interests of all DCAC Shareholders are not prejudiced by the actions or inactions of a minority  whether inadvertent or otherwise. The DCAC Board has reached a final and definitive conclusion under ¬ß5.12 of the Repurchase Offer  with the Repurchase Tenders in respect of the 1 029 614 DCAC Ordinary Shares under investigation falling into the following categories (or in some cases more than one category):Tenders for 291 737 DCAC Ordinary Shares are now regarded as being valid; Tenders for 357 876 DCAC Ordinary Shares where the DCAC Board has confirmed to its satisfaction that it was correctly of the opinion that either the DCAC Shareholder had tendered for more than 95% of the DCAC Ordinary Shares held under their control as at the Record Date; and/or had acquired the DCAC Ordinary Shares after the Record Date; and/or had already tendered holdings under the same fund management in earlier settlement rounds; Tenders for 380 000 DCAC Ordinary Shares received after the cut-off time  (of which 270 275 would otherwise have been valid  and 109 725 would also have fallen under b) above).Whilst the DCAC Board appreciated the co-operation of those DCAC Shareholders who replied to our enquiries  nonetheless it is difficult to treat those DCAC Shareholders who had submitted valid tenders fairly by accepting invalid tenders. Therefore  only Repurchase Tenders for 11 112 302 DCAC Ordinary Shares are hereby declared by the DCAC Board as being valid and the Company has therefore agreed to repurchase the same. As all Repurchase Tenders were made at ¬£10.789 / DCAC Ordinary Share  this results in ¬£119.89 million being returned to DCAC Shareholders.The repurchased DCAC Ordinary Shares will be held as Treasury Shares  pending prospective reissue under the potential Advanced Cables Business Combination (as further described in the press release issued by the Company on 20 February 2023). The Company confirms that  once these repurchases have been settled  the Company will own 87.16% of its total issued share capital in Treasury. DCAC Shareholders should note that consequent upon the proposed Business Combination  there may be issue of further DCAC Ordinary Shares  DCAC Sponsor Shares and/or new DCAC Ordinary Shares issued pursuant to any exercise of DCAC Warrants  over and above the re-issue of Treasury Shares.However  in respect of invalid tenders where the DCAC Board is of the reasonably formed opinion that the DCAC shareholder had inadvertently made an administrative error and has admitted to the same  the Board will instruct its agents to engage with those DCAC Shareholders to see if a reasonable accommodation can be made  as long as such DCAC Shareholders bear the time and out of pocket costs associated with the reconciliation exercise so as not to disadvantage other DCAC Shareholders. Further consideration will be given to the status of shares that were tendered  but which tenders have been declared ineligible  noting inter alia Clause 8.1 of the Repurchase Tender document. Following the Repurchase Tender  the DCAC share holdings are as follows:DCAC Ordinary Shares Number % (ex treasury)Residual held post valid tenders 649 822 38.9%Ineligible tenders 737 876 44.2%Held by DCAC Sponsor 281 252 16.9%In Treasury 11 331 052Total 13 000 002Due to the procedural complexities resulting from the invalid tendering  settlement of valid tenders was delayed. We once again apologise that those who had validly tendered were inconvenienced accordingly.The Company wishes to thank its executive  Kempen and Admina for their work in ascertaining the validity of the Tenders.Edmund TruellCEO  DCACAbout DCACDCAC is a special purpose acquisition company incorporated on 29 April 2021 under the Companies Law as a non-cellular company limited by shares.

This press release follows on from the review and approval of the financial statements by MRM‚Äôs Board of Directors in its meeting of 7 March 2023.Fran√ßois Matray  Chief Executive Officer of MRM  said: ‚ÄúIn late 2022  MRM moved to a whole new level in terms of scale by acquiring two shopping centres from Altarea. This increased the value of our portfolio by more than 50% and our rental base by more than 60%. In addition  by funding the deal with a balance of debt and equity  we kept our LTV ratio under control  while welcoming Altarea among our shareholders. Our existing portfolio also performed well in operational terms in 2022. Retailer revenue in our shopping centres rose above its 2019 level and lettings activity remained firm  resulting in an increase of almost 3% in our annualised net rents. From 2023  the acquisitions will have their full effect  boosting our revenue as well as our operating margin through better coverage of fixed costs. Above all  we will be able to apply our asset management and value-enhancement skills across a larger portfolio. We are therefore highly confident that we will be able to increase annualised net rents to above ‚Ç¨16 million by 2025 at constant scope.‚ÄùStory continuesA year marked by the structuring acquisition of two shopping centersIn late 2022  MRM acquired two shopping centres from Altarea for a total of ‚Ç¨90.4 million including transfer taxes. These shopping centres have been part of MRM‚Äôs portfolio and consolidated in its financial statements since 16 November 2022.One shopping centre is located in Flins in the Yvelines region of France  and the other one in Ollioules in the Var region. They are successful properties combining yields with value-enhancement potential. Both have a Carrefour hypermarket as food retail anchor and are leading shopping centres within their catchment areas. Integrating these shopping centres has taken MRM‚Äôs scale to a whole new level. The value of its portfolio has increased by more than 50% and its annualised net rents by more than 60%  and this is opening up new perspectives.As announced in late July 2022  the deal was funded through two capital increases totalling ‚Ç¨50 million  subscribed by SCOR SE and Altarea in an amount of ‚Ç¨25 million each. The rest of the transaction cost was financed through a ‚Ç¨42 million bank loan. This scheme enabled MRM to keep its LTV ratio under control at less than 44%.Ongoing good momentum in operational termsWithin MRM‚Äôs historic scope6  retailer revenue was 3% higher than in 2019. This strong performance was due to a 2% increase in retailer revenue for stores of over 500 sqm and a 5% increase for stores of less than 500 sqm.Retailer revenue7 2022 vs. 2019 2022 vs. 20218 Large stores (> 500 sqm) +2% +2% Small stores (< 500 sqm) +5% +7% Total +3% +3%In MRM‚Äôs historic scope  13 leases were signed in 2022  representing total rents of ‚Ç¨0.9 million and a total floor area of 4 900 sqm. The average reversion rate compared with market rental values was +1%.New leases notably include:‚Ä¢ Ongoing lettings activity at the Valentin shopping centre (near Besan√ßon): new leases totalling 270 sqm were signed  further improving the retailer mix;‚Ä¢ The reletting of the 2 000 sqm medium-sized unit within the Carr√© V√©lizy mixed-use development (V√©lizy-Villacoublay)  vacated by Office Depot in January 2022  to fitness chain On Air  with the new lease coming into effect on 29 April 2022;‚Ä¢ The addition of two Rougi√© & Pl√© stores with total floorspace of 1 100 sqm in Passage de la R√©union in Mulhouse;‚Ä¢ A 700 sqm unit in Aria Parc in Allonnes let to Takko Fashion  taking the occupancy rate of this retail park ‚Äì which is discount-focused with two key retailers Action and Centrakor ‚Äì to 100%.This good level of lettings activity increased the historic scope‚Äôs physical occupancy rate by 1.0 point and its financial occupancy rate by 0.6 point. The addition of the Flins and Ollioules shopping centres also boosted overall physical and financial occupancy rates by 0.3 and 0.6 point respectively. After retail chain Cama√Øeu has been placed in liquidation in September 2022  three units occupied by Cama√Øeu ‚Äì one in MRM‚Äôs historic portfolio and two in the Flins and Ollioules centres ‚Äì entirely offset those increases  and so physical and financial occupancy rates as at 31 December 2022 remained stable at 90% and 88% respectively.Annualised net rents totalled ‚Ç¨15.1 million as at 1 January 2023  an increase of 62% relative to 1 January 2022. That major increase resulted from the addition of the Flins and Ollioules shopping centres while annualised net rents in the historic scope continued to rise from ‚Ç¨9.3 million to ‚Ç¨9.6 million  an increase of 3%.Sharp rise in portfolio valueThe value of MRM‚Äôs portfolio was ‚Ç¨244.9 million as at 31 December 2022  a year-on-year increase of 51.2% driven by the integration of the Flins and Ollioules shopping centres. The value of MRM‚Äôs historic portfolio saw a limited decline of 0.9% over a year.‚Ç¨ million 31/12/2022 31/12/2021 Change Like-for-like change9 Portfolio value excl. TT 244.9 162.0 +51.2% -0.9%Financial resultsRental incomeGross rental income for 2022  corresponding to rents billed  amounted to ‚Ç¨10.2 million  an increase of 4.7%. This was mainly driven by changes in scope: the Flins and Ollioules acquisition had a positive effect of ‚Ç¨0.7 million (consolidated for 1.5 months)  while the October 2021 disposals had a negative impact of ‚Ç¨0.2 million.Like-for-like  gross rental income was stable  with new leases and indexation offsetting the effect of the medium-sized unit in Carr√© V√©lizy becoming temporarily vacant from January 2022 (new lease effective from late April 2022).After taking into account non-recovered property expenses  net rental income was ‚Ç¨8.1 million compared with ‚Ç¨8.0 million in 2021  an increase of 2.4%.Rental income‚Ç¨ million 2022 2021 Change Like-for-like change Gross rental income 10.2 9.7 +4.7% 0.0% Recurring non-recovered property expenses (1.9) (1.6) Non-recurring items10 (0.2) 0.2 Net rental income 8.1 8.0 +2.4%Unwinding of Covid-related debt waiver agreementsThe unwinding of Covid-related debt waiver agreements  introduced to support tenants  resulted in the reversal of provisions set aside in previous years.The collection rate for rents an charges also moved back to a normal level  rising above 95% for the year as a whole.Net operating cash flow 11 of ‚Ç¨4. 0 millionAs a result of the increase in net rental income  the positive impact from the unwinding of Covid-related debt waiver agreements and lower operating expenses  EBITDA rose by 5.4% to ‚Ç¨5.8 million in 2022.The net cost of debt rose from ‚Ç¨1.2 million in 2021 to ‚Ç¨1.8 million in 2022. This was due to the new ‚Ç¨42.0 million loan that partly funded the acquisition of the Flins and Ollioules shopping centres  but also the increase in the average cost of debt caused by higher interest rates.Net operating cash flow was ‚Ç¨4.0 million  up 2.7% relative to 2021.‚Ç¨ million 2022 2021 Change Net rental income 8.2 8.0 +2.5% Tenant support measures 0.4 (0.2) Operating expenses (2.4) (2.5) -2.6% Other operating income and expenses (0.4) 0.2 EBITDA 5.8 5.5 +5.4% Net cost of debt (1.8) (1.6) Net operating cash flow 4.0 3.9 +2.7%On a full-year basis  the additional revenue from the two shopping centres acquired in late 2022 will result in better coverage of operating expenses. Operating expenses equalled 19.1% of net rental income based on pro forma 2022 figures12 as opposed to 29.5% on the basis of reported 2022 figures and 31.0% in 2021.Calculated on the basis of the implementation of the new ‚Ç¨42.0 million loan at the start of 2022  and therefore of more favorable borrowing conditions than the current rates  the cost of debt amounts to ‚Ç¨2.6 million in 2022 on a pro forma basis. Applying a 3-month Euribor rate of 3% to the whole of 2022  the pro forma 2022 cost of debt would be ‚Ç¨4.4 million.Solid financial position maintainedIn November 2022  MRM arranged a new ‚Ç¨42.0 million bank loan  due to mature in late 2029  to fund the acquisition of the Flins and Ollioules shopping centres.MRM had ‚Ç¨116.7 million of debt outstanding at 31 December 2022  as opposed to ‚Ç¨75.7 million at end-2021. The average cost of debt was 2.07%. MRM‚Äôs debt is fully remunerated at variable rate and 77% is hedged by caps (with strike rates between 1% and 2.5%).The next significant redemption date is in late 2028.At the end of December 2022  MRM had cash and cash equivalents of ‚Ç¨10.4 million compared with ‚Ç¨9.7 million a year earlier.The funding scheme used to acquire the two shopping centres allowed MRM to keep its net LTV ratio under control at 43.6% at end-December 2022 as opposed to 40.0% a year earlier.End-2022 NAV per share up 1.3% compared with the end-2021 figure adjusted for the shareholder pay - outEPRA NDV amounted to ‚Ç¨139.0 million at the end of December 2022. This compares with ‚Ç¨97.4 million a year earlier  or ‚Ç¨93.5 million after the ‚Ç¨3.9 million pay-out to shareholders with respect to 2021. After pay-out  this represents a 48.7% increase in EPRA NDV. The increase mainly reflects the impact of:Capital increases in 2022  amounting to ‚Ç¨49.1 million net of fees;Net operating cash flow of ‚Ç¨4.0 million in 2022;An ‚Ç¨-8.8 million change in the fair value of properties  comprising a ‚Ç¨6.4 million charge related to transfer taxes and acquisition fees for the Flins and Ollioules shopping centres and a -‚Ç¨2.4 million change in fair value of the historic portfolio;A ‚Ç¨1.6 million change in the fair value of financial instruments.Adjusted for the shareholder pay-out with respect to 2021  EPRA NDV per share was ‚Ç¨42.8 at the end of December 2021. At the end of December 2022  EPRA NDV per share was ‚Ç¨43.4. This represents an increase of 1.3%  despite the increase in the number of shares caused by capital increases in 2022.Shareholder pay-outMRM‚Äôs Board of Directors has decided to propose to the shareholders a pay-out premiums in an amount of ‚Ç¨1.80 per share with respect to 2022  similar to the amount per share paid out with respect to 2021. This would correspond to a total pay-out of ‚Ç¨5.8 million  as opposed to the ‚Ç¨3.9 million paid out the previous year.This represents a yield of 6.7% based on the share price at 6 March 2023.The pay-out is subject to approval in the 7 June 2023 General Meeting of Shareholders. The ex date is expected to be 12 June 2023  with a payment date of 14 June 2023.OutlookWith its larger store portfolio and its relationships with a greater number of retailers and chains  MRM intends to continue implementing its dynamic asset management policy  with the following priorities:‚Ä¢ Analysing and implementing investment programmes aimed at enhancing the value of properties  i.e. both the historic portfolio and the two shopping centres acquired in late 2022;‚Ä¢ Letting available space;‚Ä¢ Implementing the Company‚Äôs ESG action plan and Climate Plan  paying particular attention to reducing energy consumption and proactively publishing a Statement of Non-Financial Performance (D√©claration de Performance Extra Financi√®re  DPEF) in April 2023;‚Ä¢ Managing the property portfolio dynamically  looking at potential acquisitions and disposals.From 2023  MRM will see the full impact of acquiring the Flins and Ollioules shopping centres  which will boost its revenue as well as its operating margin through better coverage of fixed costs.MRM confirms that  including these acquisitions  it is aiming for annualised net rents of over ‚Ç¨16 million by 2025  as opposed to ‚Ç¨10 million previously. This target is based on the current portfolio (excluding any acquisitions and disposals).Finally  MRM intends to maintain its policy of making regular pay-outs to shareholders.CalendarFinancial information for the first quarter of 2023 will be published before the market opens on 11 May 2023.The General Meeting of Shareholders will take place on 7 June 2023.About MRMMRM is a listed real estate investment company that owns and manages a portfolio of retail properties across several regions of France.

That increase was due to:A 2.4% increase in net rental income from ‚Ç¨8.0 million in 2021 to ‚Ç¨8.1 million in 2022; A slight decrease in operating expenses from ‚Ç¨2.5 million in 2021 to ‚Ç¨2.4 million in 2022; The unwinding of Covid-related debt waiver agreements in 2022  which resulted in the reversal of provisions set aside in previous years: the sub-total of provisions net of reversals and other net operating income and expenses represented an expense of ‚Ç¨0.3 million in 2022 as opposed to an expense of ‚Ç¨1.0 million in 2021.Transfer taxes and acquisition fees related to the Flins and Ollioules shopping centres represented an expense of ‚Ç¨6.4 million. The fair value of the existing portfolio also fell by ‚Ç¨2.4 million  leading to a total ‚Ç¨-8.8 million change in the fair value of properties  as opposed to a ‚Ç¨2.6 million change in 2021.As a result  there was an operating loss of ‚Ç¨3.4 million in 2022  as opposed to operating income of ‚Ç¨7.6 million in 2021.The net cost of debt rose from ‚Ç¨1.2 million in 2021 to ‚Ç¨1.8 million in 2022  due to the new loan that partly funded the acquisition of the Flins and Ollioules centres  but also the increase in the average cost of debt caused by higher interest rates.MRM also benefited from a positive change in the fair value of financial instruments in an amount of ‚Ç¨1.6 million. As a result  net financial expense was ‚Ç¨0.2 million compared with ‚Ç¨2.0 million a year earlier.Overall  MRM made a consolidated net loss of ‚Ç¨3.6 million in 2022  as opposed to net income of ‚Ç¨5.6 million in 2021.Appendix 4: 2022 pro forma figures2022 pro forma figures are based on the Flins and Ollioules shopping centres being acquired on 1 January 2022.‚Ç¨ million 2022pro forma 2022reported 2021 Consolidation of the Flins and Ollioules centres Assumed over12 months 1.5 months Gross rental income 15.1 10.2 9.7 Net rental income 13.1 8.1 8.0 Operating expenses (2.5) (2.4) (2.5) EBITDA 10.6 5.8 5.5 Net cost of debt (2.6) (1.8) (1.6) Net operating cash flow 8.1 4.0 3.9If the new ‚Ç¨42.0 million loan had been in place at the start of 2022  when borrowing conditions were more favourable than currently  the cost of debt would have been ‚Ç¨2.6 million in 2022 on a pro forma basis.

The theme of this year‚Äôs event is #EmbraceEquality ‚Äì a concept that underscores Accor‚Äôs operations and underpins its future strategy and direction.A total of 13 914 Heartists¬Æ ‚Äì Accor‚Äôs passionate  inspiring associates ‚Äì in Southeast Asia  Japan & Korea are women  including many General Managers and senior executives.

20030,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/press-release-dupixent-dupilumab-application-060000748.html,Press Release: Dupixent¬Æ (dupilumab) application for treatment of chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) in adults and adolescents accepted for FDA review,Dupixent¬Æ (dupilumab) application for treatment of chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) in adults and adolescents accepted for FDA review More than 300 000...,Sanofi - Aventis GroupeDupixent¬Æ (dupilumab) application for treatment of chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) in adults and adolescents accepted for FDA reviewMore than 300 000 people in the U.S. suffer from CSU that is inadequately controlled by antihistaminesParis and Tarrytown  N.Y. March 7  2023. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted  for review  the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for Dupixent¬Æ (dupilumab) to treat adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) that is not adequately controlled with the current standard of care  H1 antihistamine treatment. The target action date for the FDA decision is October 22  2023.CSU is an inflammatory skin condition driven in part by type 2 inflammation  which causes sudden and debilitating hives and swelling on the skin. Swelling  called angioedema  may occur most commonly on the face  hands and feet  but can also affect the throat and upper airways. CSU is typically treated with H1 antihistamines  medicines that target histamine-1 receptors on cells to control symptoms of urticaria. However  the disease remains uncontrolled in up to 50% of patients  who are left with limited alternative treatment options. These individuals continue to experience symptoms  including persistent itch or burning sensations that can be debilitating and significantly impact quality of life.The sBLA is supported by data from two Phase 3 trials (LIBERTY-CUPID Studies A and B)  evaluating Dupixent in two different patient populations with uncontrolled CSU. Study A was conducted in CSU patients who were uncontrolled on standard-of-care antihistamines with efficacy and safety data supporting the submission  while Study B was conducted in CSU patients who were uncontrolled on standard-of-care antihistamines and refractory to omalizumab with results providing additional supporting data.The potential use of Dupixent in CSU is currently under clinical development  and the safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.Story continuesAbout the CSU Clinical Trial ProgramThe clinical trial program  known as LIBERTY-CUPID  includes Studies A and B  two Phase 3 randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in two different patient populations with uncontrolled CSU. Study A evaluated Dupixent as an add-on therapy to standard-of-care H1 antihistamines compared to antihistamines alone in 138 patients with CSU aged 6 years and older who remained symptomatic despite antihistamine use and were not previously treated with omalizumab. Study B evaluated Dupixent in 108 patients with CSU aged 12 to 80 years who remained symptomatic despite standard-of-care treatment and were intolerant or incomplete responders to omalizumab.In addition to CSU  Sanofi and Regeneron are also studying Dupixent in chronic inducible urticaria triggered by cold (LIBERTY-CINDU CUrIADS program) in an ongoing Phase 3 trial.About DupixentDupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the IL-4 and IL-13 pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent  such as atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  prurigo nodularis and eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE).Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP  EoE or prurigo nodularis in different age populations.

(NASDAQ  Euronext Amsterdam: VEON) (‚ÄúVEON‚Äù or the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù)  a global digital operator that provides converged connectivity and online services  today provides an update on the timing of the ratio change under the Company‚Äôs ADR program  previously announced on 6 February 2023 and originally planned to become effective on 6 March 2023 (the ‚ÄúRatio Change‚Äù). As announced on 6 March 2023  the Company was informed late afternoon on Friday  3 March 2023 by BNY Mellon that the ratio change effectiveness had been postponed as The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (‚ÄúDTCC‚Äù) was not prepared to make the new CUSIP reflecting the new ratio available on Monday  6 March 2023 as scheduled. DTCC has now confirmed the availability of the new CUSIP  and the effective date of the Ratio Change (the ‚ÄúEffective Date‚Äù) is now confirmed as 8 March 2023.As previously announced with respect to the Ratio Change  as of the Effective Date  record holders who directly hold ADRs will be required to exchange their existing ADRs for new ADRs on the basis of one (1) new ADR for every twenty-five (25) existing ADRs surrendered. The Depositary will contact ADR holders and arrange for the exchange of their existing ADRs for new ADRs. American Depositary Share (‚ÄúADS‚Äù) beneficial holders who hold through an ADR holder intermediary need not take any action in connection with the Ratio Change.For ADS holders  the Ratio Change will have the same effect as a one for twenty five reverse ADS split. No new VEON common shares will be issued in connection with the Ratio Change and the ADSs will continue to be traded on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol ‚ÄúVEON.‚ÄùAs a result of the Ratio Change  the trading price of the Company‚Äôs ADSs is expected to automatically increase proportionally  but the Company can give no assurance that the ADS trading price following the Ratio Change will be at least equal to the ADS trading price before the Ratio Change multiplied by the new 25:1 ratio. As VEON announced previously on 5 October 2022  the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Market granted VEON an additional grace period through 3 April 2023 to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement set forth in Nasdaq‚Äôs Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the ‚ÄúMinimum Bid Price‚Äù). While the Ratio Change is intended to bring the bid price of the Company‚Äôs ADSs into compliance with the Minimum Bid Price  the Company can give no assurance that the Ratio Change will be effective in achieving this goal.The Company‚Äôs original announcement with respect to the ratio change can be found on the Company‚Äôs website at this address:https://www.veon.com/media/media-releases/2023/veon-announces-ratio-change-under-its-american-depositary-receipt-adr-program/About VEONVEON is a global digital operator that currently provides converged connectivity and online services to over 200 million customers in seven dynamic markets.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for review the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for Dupixent¬Æ (dupilumab) to treat adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) that is not adequately controlled with the current standard of care  H1 antihistamine treatment. The target action date for the FDA decision is October 22  2023.CSU is an inflammatory skin condition driven in part by type 2 inflammation  which causes sudden and debilitating hives and swelling on the skin. Swelling  called angioedema  may occur most commonly on the face  hands and feet  but can also affect the throat and upper airways. CSU is typically treated with H1 antihistamines  medicines that target histamine-1 receptors on cells to control symptoms of urticaria. However  the disease remains uncontrolled in up to 50% of patients  who are left with limited alternative treatment options. These individuals continue to experience symptoms  including persistent itch or burning sensations that can be debilitating and significantly impact quality of life.The sBLA is supported by data from two Phase 3 trials (LIBERTY-CUPID Studies A and B) evaluating Dupixent in two different patient populations with uncontrolled CSU. Study A was conducted in CSU patients who were uncontrolled on standard-of-care antihistamines with efficacy and safety data supporting the submission  while Study B was conducted in CSU patients who were uncontrolled on standard-of-care antihistamines and refractory to omalizumab with results providing additional supporting data.The potential use of Dupixent in CSU is currently under clinical development  and the safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.Story continuesAbout the CSU Clinical Trial ProgramThe clinical trial program  known as LIBERTY-CUPID  includes Studies A and B  two Phase 3 randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in two different patient populations with uncontrolled CSU.Study A evaluated Dupixent as an add-on therapy to standard-of-care H1 antihistamines compared to antihistamines alone in 138 patients with CSU aged 6 years and older who remained symptomatic despite antihistamine use and were not previously treated with omalizumab. Study B evaluated Dupixent in 108 patients with CSU aged 12 to 80 years who remained symptomatic despite standard-of-care treatment and were intolerant or incomplete responders to omalizumab.In addition to CSU  Regeneron and Sanofi are also studying Dupixent in chronic inducible urticaria triggered by cold (LIBERTY-CINDU CUrIADS program) in an ongoing Phase 3 trial.About DupixentDupixent  which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune¬Æ technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the IL-4 and IL-13 pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent  such as atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  prurigo nodularis and eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE).Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP  EoE or prurigo nodularis in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in Europe  the U.S. and Japan. More than 500 000 patients have been treated with Dupixent globally.About Regeneron‚Äôs VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron‚Äôs VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron‚Äôs President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite¬Æ technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create a substantial proportion of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies currently available. This includes Dupixent  REGEN-COV¬Æ (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Libtayo¬Æ (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent¬Æ (alirocumab)  Kevzara¬Æ (sarilumab)  Evkeeza¬Æ (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb¬Æ (atoltivimab  maftivimab  and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including pediatric EoE  atopic hand and foot dermatitis  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  CSU  chronic pruritus of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. INDICATIONSDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe eczema (atopic dermatitis or AD) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies.

Income Tax (0.1) (0.0) n.s. Net Result (38.2) (23.6)Jean-Baptiste Lucas  CEO of McPhy  states: ""In 2022  McPhy has achieved several key milestones towards its industrial scale-up in a market context displaying the first signs of acceleration. Indeed  large-scale projects have materialized and will certainly expand in the coming years to reach the carbon neutrality objectives set by the French government and European institutions. To meet this challenge  we have significantly increased the production capacity of our two product lines. Small and medium-capacity electrolyzers on the San Miniato site  which is now automated for mass production. Large-capacity electrolyzers through the start of construction of our Gigafactory in Belfort. As for the refueling stations  we are now located in Grenoble in a new factory which will enable us to produce 150 hydrogen distribution stations per year over time. This site brings together all our teams and is now the company's headquarters. From a commercial perspective  McPhy has recorded at the end of the year a first major contract in the industry with one of the world's largest steel manufacturers. This project confirms the tremendous potential of low-carbon hydrogen in manufacturing applications. We now have two challenges to meet: accelerating our commercial penetration and pursuing the industrialization of mass production of reliable and competitive high-capacity equipment. To achieve such objectives  our roadmap is based on two priorities: the continuation of our industrialization phase and the development of our technological enhancements. In this respect  we can count on accelerated market growth  a solid balance sheet and the support of our partners. All these elements are assets to achieve McPhy's ambition to play a leading role in the future of low-carbon hydrogen‚Äù.Story continuesReturn to sustained sales growth in 2022 and strong order intakeRevenue for fiscal year 2022 increase by 22%  compare to 2021  to ‚Ç¨16.1 million. Restated for the takeover of two old generation stations sold during previous years (which amount deducted from the revenue of the first half of the year)  revenue would be ‚Ç¨18.3 million compared to ‚Ç¨13.1 million in 2021  i.e. a growth of +39%. This return to growth primarily results from the execution of the first orders under the major contracts signed over the past years. Sales are split between the supply of large capacity electrolyzers from the McLyzer and Piel range (68%) and the supply of stations (32%).In addition  McPhy recorded a strong growth of +53% in firm order intake to ‚Ç¨29.4 million  bringing the order backlog to ‚Ç¨30.6 million as of December 31  2022  up +51% compared to December 31  2021.As of 31 December 2022  McPhy had a portfolio of projects signed  commissioned and/or under execution representing a cumulative 45 MW for the supply of electrolyzers and 40 stations.The Group has furthermore been identified as a preferred partner and/or selected as a supplier for a total capacity of 148 MW and 56 stations  bringing its portfolio of opportunities to 193 MW for the supply of electrolyzers and 96 for the supply of stations.Operating result reflecting growth investmentsIn fiscal year 2022  to support the expected growth in its business  the Group has continued its development strategy. This has resulted in an increase in current expenses linked to :the structuring of the teams and active recruitment plan;innovation and R&D expenditure related to the improvement of current products and the development of its new ranges of electrolyzers and stations;the strengthening of its engineering resources for the executionof customer projects.In this context  personnel expenses increased by approximately ‚Ç¨6 million in 2022  as a result of the recruitment of 85 new employees  and reached ‚Ç¨17.7 million. Other external expenses amounted to ‚Ç¨21.1 million  a significant increase due to the Group's commitment to structuring and enhancing its industrial  engineering and R&D activities (subcontracting services  prospection costs  technical expertise).EBITDA  which includes for an amount of ‚Ç¨1.6 million the share of IPCEI grant4 applicable to the eligible expenses over the period  stands at ‚Ç¨(36.8) million and is within the range announced at the time of the annual revenue publication.The Operating result is ‚Ç¨(38.4) million  with no significant difference to EBITDA  unlike the previous year. This is explained by changes in provisions related to the Energiedienst incident in 2021  including a reversal with utilization of ‚Ç¨2.6 million in 2022 (prior year accrual was ‚Ç¨4.5 million): restated for these items  net provisions are comparable year-on-year.Taking into account a positive financial result  the Net Result standsat ‚Ç¨(38.2) million  compared to ‚Ç¨(23.6) million in 2021.Solid cash position as of December 31  2022Net cash consumption was ‚Ç¨(41.7) million in fiscal year 2022  including:cash flow from operating activities of ‚Ç¨(43.7) million (excluding the IPCEI4 operating grant)  due to the change in EBITDA and a ‚Ç¨(7.8) million change in working capital requirements;this net working capital requirement is explained by the sustained growth and the increase in inventories  due to the anticipated procurement of some critical components;the initial payment of the IPCEI4 public aid for an amount of ‚Ç¨26.9 million  including the ‚Ç¨1.6 million deduction for the share taken to the profit and loss statement;the investments necessary for the Group‚Äôs scale-up amounting to ‚Ç¨(13.1) million  of which ‚Ç¨(7.7) million dedicated to the Gigafactory;the financial investment of ‚Ç¨(12.4) million in the Hype convertible bonds subscribed as part of the strategic partnership concluded in December 2021.As a result  McPhy holds a cash position of ‚Ç¨135.5 million as of December 31  2022 compared to ‚Ç¨177.2 million as of December 31  2021.Acceleration of industrial scale-up with the launch of the Gigafactory projectIn the framework of the eligibility of its electrolyzer Gigafactory project to the European IPCEI4 scheme  the Company concluded a public aid agreement with the French State through Bpifrance  for a maximum amount of ‚Ç¨114 million. Following the signature of this agreement  McPhy has made its final investment decision and received a first payment of ‚Ç¨28.5 million from Bpifrance in the last quarter of 2022. Work has already started on the commissioning of the future plant in Belfort  with a launch scheduled for the first half of 2024  followed by a gradual ramp-up to reach an annual production capacity of 1 GW. The amount of investments dedicated to the Gigafactory should be around ‚Ç¨25 million for the year 2023.Concurrently  McPhy has continued its efforts to scale up the electrolyzer part of the business by increasing its production capacity to 300 MW at its San Miniato site  in order to meet market demand while awaiting the commissioning of the Gigafactory.For the stations business  McPhy has finalized the regrouping of all the activities of this business line on its new site in the heart of Grenoble in an existing industrial building of more than 4 000 sqm. This new site will have a production capacity of 150 stations per year.OutlookThe level of its backlog and the continued ramp-up of the hydrogen market allow McPhy to anticipate another year of sustained growth in 2023.The annual financial report will be made available as part of its 2022 Universal Registration Document no later than April 30  2023  on the Company's Investor website  in the ‚Äú Financial reports ‚Äù section (https://www.mcphy-finance.com).Upcoming financial events :Annual General Meeting   on May 24  20232023 First-Half Results  on July 27  2023  after market closeABOUT MCPHYSpecialized in hydrogen production and distribution equipment  McPhy is contributing to the global deployment of low-carbon hydrogen as a solution for energy transition.

The VITESSE trial will use the modified Viaskin Peanut 250 Œºg patch and enroll 600 subjects  randomized 2:1 active versus placebo. The study will involve approximately 80 trial sites across the United States  Canada  Australia  and Europe. The primary efficacy endpoint of the study is the percentage of treatment responders in the active versus placebo arms at Month 12. Secondary efficacy endpoints include changes in cumulative reactive dose (CRD)  eliciting dose (ED) and severity of allergic reaction at Month 12 food challenge.‚ÄúI am pleased that the first trial participant has been screened in the VITESSE study ‚Äù said David Fleischer  MD  FAAAAI  FACAAI  Children‚Äôs Hospital Colorado and Global Principal Investigator for the VITESSE study  ‚ÄúThese peanut-allergic children represent a cohort of patients that are eagerly awaiting potential treatment options.

Dr. David Fleischer  Colorado Children‚Äôs Hospital  will act as the global study Principal Investigator.The primary efficacy endpoint is the percentage of treatment responders in the active versus placebo arms at Month 12. The primary efficacy analysis includes the success criterion of a lower bound of the confidence interval of the difference in responder rates between active and placebo groups being greater than or equal to 15%.A treatment responder is defined as either a subject with a baseline ED ‚â§30 mg who reaches an ED ‚â•300 mg of peanut protein at Month 12  or a subject with a baseline ED = 100 mg who reaches an ED ‚â•600 mg of peanut protein at Month 12. A double-blind  placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) will be administered at baseline and Month 12 to determine a subject‚Äôs ED at both timepoints.During the screening period  subjects will undergo an initial visit with assessment for eligibility according to peanut skin prick test (SPT) and serum peanut IgE. Those meeting these criteria will proceed to a DBPCFC to confirm their peanut allergy and establish an entry peanut ED. The entry DBPCFC will be 1 mg peanut protein  and will escalate up to a highest single dose of 100 mg peanut protein. Subjects who react with an ED at or below the dose of 100 mg peanut protein and meet all other inclusion and no exclusion criteria are considered eligible. At Month 12  a post-treatment DBPCFC will be performed  with a starting dose of 3 mg peanut protein  escalating to a highest dose of 1 000 mg peanut protein according to the following schedule: 3  10  30  100  300  600  1 000 mg.

Secondary efficacy endpoints include changes in cumulative reactive dose (CRD)  eliciting dose (ED) and severity of allergic reaction at Month 12 food challenge.‚ÄúI am pleased that the first trial participant has been screened in the VITESSE study ‚Äù said David Fleischer  MD  FAAAAI  FACAAI  Children‚Äôs Hospital Colorado and Global Principal Investigator for the VITESSE study  ‚ÄúThese peanut-allergic children represent a cohort of patients that are eagerly awaiting potential treatment options. I am looking forward to leading the team of highly skilled VITESSE investigators and their staff as we generate these critical data that may one day potentially support a BLA submission for Viaskin Peanut.‚ÄùLast year  following productive exchanges with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  DBV finalized the VITESSE protocol and received the FDA‚Äôs support to advance the study. Previously  the FDA had requested changes to certain elements of the VITESSE protocol with the intent for the trial to support a future Biologics License Application (BLA).""The initiation of the VITESSE Phase 3 Study in peanut-allergic children ages 4 - 7 years represents a culmination of years of research and collaboration between DBV  FDA  patient groups  site investigators  trial centers  and  of course  the support and unwavering encouragement from food-allergic families ‚Äù said Pharis Mohideen  MD  Chief Medical Officer  DBV Technologies. ‚ÄúDBV is proud to see that patient screening has begun in Q1 2023. This important milestone reflects incredible work from the DBV team and swift action in beginning enrollment from Principal Investigators like Dr. Dareen Siri and others. We are grateful for the strong collaboration that will continue throughout the VITESSE study.‚ÄùPrincipal Investigator  Dr. Dareen Siri  FAAAAI  FACAAI from Midwest Allergy Sinus Asthma  in Normal and Springfield  Illinois was the first to conduct a screening visit for a potential new enrollee.""I am thrilled that our talented team of clinicians was the first to screen a patient for the VITESSE clinical study ‚Äù said Dareen Siri  MD  Midwest Allergy Sinus Asthma  Normal  IL. ‚ÄúThe initiation of patient enrollment in VITESSE reinforces our commitment to peanut-allergic children and their families and is an important step in generating the data needed to potentially advance Viaskin Peanut to market. I am grateful that peanut-allergic children have the opportunity to participate in a trial that may one day help other kids just like them living with peanut allergy. There is a lot of excitement around the VITESSE study  and I am proud our team will be an integral part of it.‚ÄùDBV anticipates screening the last patient in 1H 2024 and announcing topline results in 1H 2025.About VITESSEThe VITESSE trial will enroll 600 subjects  randomized 2:1 active versus placebo. The study will involve approximately 80 trial sites across the United States  Canada  Australia and Europe. Dr. David Fleischer  Colorado Children‚Äôs Hospital  will act as the global study Principal Investigator.The primary efficacy endpoint is the percentage of treatment responders in the active versus placebo arms at Month 12. The primary efficacy analysis includes the success criterion of a lower bound of the confidence interval of the difference in responder rates between active and placebo groups being greater than or equal to 15%.A treatment responder is defined as either a subject with a baseline ED ‚â§30 mg who reaches an ED ‚â•300 mg of peanut protein at Month 12  or a subject with a baseline ED = 100 mg who reaches an ED ‚â•600 mg of peanut protein at Month 12. A double-blind  placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) will be administered at baseline and Month 12 to determine a subject‚Äôs ED at both timepoints.During the screening period  subjects will undergo an initial visit with assessment for eligibility according to peanut skin prick test (SPT) and serum peanut IgE. Those meeting these criteria will proceed to a DBPCFC to confirm their peanut allergy and establish an entry peanut ED. The entry DBPCFC will be 1 mg peanut protein  and will escalate up to a highest single dose of 100 mg peanut protein. Subjects who react with an ED at or below the dose of 100 mg peanut protein and meet all other inclusion and no exclusion criteria are considered eligible. At Month 12  a post-treatment DBPCFC will be performed  with a starting dose of 3 mg peanut protein  escalating to a highest dose of 1 000 mg peanut protein according to the following schedule: 3  10  30  100  300  600  1 000 mg. Secondary efficacy endpoints include changes in CRD  ED and severity of allergic reaction at Month 12 food challenge.About DBV TechnologiesDBV Technologies is developing Viaskin‚Ñ¢  an investigational proprietary technology platform with broad potential applications in immunotherapy.

The plan targets 150 potential recipients   At least 50 percent of the short-term incentive will be paid through Banco BPM shares subject to   to deferral‚Ä¶,"The Plan allows for the enhancement of a portion of the variable remuneration component to be paid in Banco BPM ordinary shares (the ""Shares"") from the short-term incentive plan (the ""STI Plan 2023 "").For possible recipients of the Plan - consistent with current regulatory provisions - the incentive recognized is subject to deferral clauses of four or five years and retention (restriction on sale) clauses of one year.The implementation of the Plan is subject to the achievement of predetermined access conditions aimed at ensuring the Group's profitability  capital stability and liquidity; it is also conditional on the achievement of specific financial and non-financial objectives  among which the ESG (Environmental  Social and Governance) sphere assumes relevance.The Plan will be part of the remuneration policy that the Group will adopt for 2023  to support the Strategic Plan 2021-2024 and to align interests between management and shareholders  remunerating the Group's strategic resources according to the creation of value in the medium - to - long term.Verona  7 March 2023 - Banco BPM announces that today the Board of Directors has approved the essential terms of Banco BPM's share-based compensation plan (hereinafter the ""Plan"")  pursuant to Articles 114-bis of Legislative Decree no. 58/98 (hereinafter the ""TUF"") and 84-bis of Consob Regulation no. 11971/1999  as amended and supplemented (hereinafter the ""Issuers' Regulation"")  as well as applicable supervisory provisions  to be submitted for approval to the next Shareholders' Meeting on April 20  2023.At least 50 percent of the short-term incentive will be paid through Banco BPM shares subject toThe potential recipients of the STI Plan are approximately 150 people  attributable to the most relevant personnel category.For the STI Plan  which will end in 2030  at least 50 percent of the recognized incentive will be paid through the award of Shares  and the expected expense is estimated at ‚Ç¨5 million (before taxation for potential recipients).These amounts include all deferred incentive shares that will accrue only upon the occurrence of all future conditions expected from time to time.At the instigation of the ESG Committee  the Group has declined in the Strategic Plan 2021-2024 its strategy of action and embarked on a major sustainability journey. The goal is to strengthen and concretize the integration of sustainability in corporate activities and business and  consequently  in incentive mechanisms.The process of integrating ESG strategy into the Group's governance models is also significantly reflected in the remuneration policy with reference to incentive mechanisms. In fact  the combination of objectives referring to the banking business with ESG metrics  attributed to staff in an increasingly widespread and diversified manner  is considered a key factor in strengthening the Group's results in the medium term  as it enables the combination of personal satisfaction and socio-environmental sustainability.***Approval of the proposal to purchase and dispose of treasury sharesThe Board of Directors has resolved to submit to the next Shareholders' Meeting on April 20  2023 the request for authorization to purchase and dispose of treasury shares  in order to implement  in compliance with current regulations  the remuneration policy adopted by the Bank  which provides  in particular for the Group's most relevant personnel  that at least 50% of the incentive recognized shall be paid in Shares.In any case  purchase and disposition transactions will be carried out in compliance with applicable regulations in particular on ""market abuse "" ensuring equal treatment of the shareholders.Without prejudice to the provisions of Article 2357  paragraphs 1 and 3  of the Italian Civil Code  the requested authorization concerns the purchase of treasury shares  for a maximum number of ordinary shares of Banco BPM corresponding to an amount not exceeding Euro 5 million.The authorization to purchase treasury shares is requested until the Shareholders' Meeting at which the approval of the financial statements for the year 2023 will be submitted  without prejudice to the provisions of Article 2357  paragraph 2  of the Civil Code.

ANY FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THESE RESTRICTIONS MAY CONSTITUTE A VIOLATION OF APPLICABLE SECURITIES LAWSStatus of the proposed Business CombinationDCAC announced proposals to form a Business Combination with Advanced Cables on 20th February 2023. The DCAC Board today agreed to expedite the proposals  following confirmation from further governmental representatives of their in principle support  as well as the support of strategic co-investors. DCAC will therefore now agree an exclusive option to acquire the Target.A separate update is being formulated and will be circulated to DCAC Shareholders shortly.DCAC Shareholders and DCAC Warrant Holders are advised that  if completed and approved by DCAC Shareholders  the Business Combination may result in a material increase in the value of DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Warrants.Status of the Repurchase OfferCopies of the Repurchase Tender Document and the Stub Tender Offer Circular are available on DCAC's website: www.disruptivecapitalac.com .Under the Repurchase Offer (as defined and undertaken pursuant to the Repurchase Tender Document issued by the Company on 25 January 2023)  DCAC Ordinary Shareholders were eligible to submit tenders ahead of the final date for tenders to be submitted  being the 22 February 2023.DCAC Shareholders contemplating submitting a tender were made aware that  due to settlement and anti-money laundering processes  only valid tenders submitted in time for clearance would be considered for settlement and no tenders would be considered after 15:00 CET on 22 February 2023.Further  as was provided for in the Repurchase Tender Document  no tenders would be accepted by DCAC unless the tendering DCAC Shareholder demonstrated to the DCAC Board‚Äôs satisfaction that they were only tendering 95% of their holding; and were the holder of record of the DCAC Ordinary Shares being tendered as at the Record Date  so being on the Share Register at 17:40 CET on 10 February 2023.Inter alia  Clause 5.12 of the Repurchase Tender Document provides that:""All decisions as to the number of DCAC Ordinary Shares tendered and the validity or eligibility (including the time and date of receipt) of any tender of DCAC Ordinary Shares will be made by the Company. The Company‚Äôs decision shall be final and binding on all of the parties. The Company reserves the right to reject any or all tenders that it determines in its absolute discretion not to be in proper form and tendered in good faith; or the acceptance or payment for which may  in the sole opinion of the Company  be unlawful or in breach of sanctions or other such regulations. No tender of DCAC Ordinary Shares will be deemed to be validly made until all defects or irregularities have been cured or waived. The consideration under the Tender Offer will not be dispatched until the Company is duly satisfied. The decision of the Company as to which DCAC Ordinary Shares have been successfully tendered shall be final and binding on all DCAC Ordinary Shareholders.""As of 4 March 2023  tenders that were received purporting to cover 11 850 178 DCAC Ordinary Shares  including tenders submitted after the deadline in respect of 380 000 DCAC Ordinary SharesThe Company agreed to repurchase 10 820 564 DCAC Ordinary Shares  which have now been settled at a price of ¬£10.789 / DCAC Ordinary Share.The DCAC Board  its listing agent  administrators and lawyers have carefully reviewed and sought to reconcile the Tenders where there appeared to be discrepancies. It also discharged its promise to make due and careful enquiry of those that submitted those tenders. Whilst it has been difficult  costly and time consuming to reconcile tenders  the totality of tenders would have suggested that there were 440 901 more shares in public issue than was actually the case.Purported Repurchase Tenders for 1 029 614 DCAC Ordinary Shares were investigated by the DCAC Board as being potentially invalid.The DCAC Board is mindful of its duty of care to all DCAC Shareholders  and to make sure that that the interests of all DCAC Shareholders are not prejudiced by the actions or inactions of a minority  whether inadvertent or otherwise. The DCAC Board has reached a final and definitive conclusion under ¬ß5.12 of the Repurchase Offer  with the Repurchase Tenders in respect of the 1 029 614 DCAC Ordinary Shares under investigation falling into the following categories (or in some cases more than one category):Tenders for 291 737 DCAC Ordinary Shares are now regarded as being valid; Tenders for 357 876 DCAC Ordinary Shares where the DCAC Board has confirmed to its satisfaction that it was correctly of the opinion that either the DCAC Shareholder had tendered for more than 95% of the DCAC Ordinary Shares held under their control as at the Record Date; and/or had acquired the DCAC Ordinary Shares after the Record Date; and/or had already tendered holdings under the same fund management in earlier settlement rounds; Tenders for 380 000 DCAC Ordinary Shares received after the cut-off time  (of which 270 275 would otherwise have been valid  and 109 725 would also have fallen under b) above).Whilst the DCAC Board appreciated the co-operation of those DCAC Shareholders who replied to our enquiries  nonetheless it is difficult to treat those DCAC Shareholders who had submitted valid tenders fairly by accepting invalid tenders. Therefore  only Repurchase Tenders for 11 112 302 DCAC Ordinary Shares are hereby declared by the DCAC Board as being valid and the Company has therefore agreed to repurchase the same. As all Repurchase Tenders were made at ¬£10.789 / DCAC Ordinary Share  this results in ¬£119.89 million being returned to DCAC Shareholders.The repurchased DCAC Ordinary Shares will be held as Treasury Shares  pending prospective reissue under the potential Advanced Cables Business Combination (as further described in the press release issued by the Company on 20 February 2023). The Company confirms that  once these repurchases have been settled  the Company will own 87.16% of its total issued share capital in Treasury. DCAC Shareholders should note that consequent upon the proposed Business Combination  there may be issue of further DCAC Ordinary Shares  DCAC Sponsor Shares and/or new DCAC Ordinary Shares issued pursuant to any exercise of DCAC Warrants  over and above the re-issue of Treasury Shares.However  in respect of invalid tenders where the DCAC Board is of the reasonably formed opinion that the DCAC shareholder had inadvertently made an administrative error and has admitted to the same  the Board will instruct its agents to engage with those DCAC Shareholders to see if a reasonable accommodation can be made  as long as such DCAC Shareholders bear the time and out of pocket costs associated with the reconciliation exercise so as not to disadvantage other DCAC Shareholders. Further consideration will be given to the status of shares that were tendered  but which tenders have been declared ineligible  noting inter alia Clause 8.1 of the Repurchase Tender document. Following the Repurchase Tender  the DCAC share holdings are as follows:DCAC Ordinary Shares Number % (ex treasury)Residual held post valid tenders 649 822 38.9%Ineligible tenders 737 876 44.2%Held by DCAC Sponsor 281 252 16.9%In Treasury 11 331 052Total 13 000 002Due to the procedural complexities resulting from the invalid tendering  settlement of valid tenders was delayed. We once again apologise that those who had validly tendered were inconvenienced accordingly.The Company wishes to thank its executive  Kempen and Admina for their work in ascertaining the validity of the Tenders.Edmund TruellCEO  DCACAbout DCACDCAC is a special purpose acquisition company incorporated on 29 April 2021 under the Companies Law as a non-cellular company limited by shares.

This press release follows on from the review and approval of the financial statements by MRM‚Äôs Board of Directors in its meeting of 7 March 2023.Fran√ßois Matray  Chief Executive Officer of MRM  said: ‚ÄúIn late 2022  MRM moved to a whole new level in terms of scale by acquiring two shopping centres from Altarea. This increased the value of our portfolio by more than 50% and our rental base by more than 60%. In addition  by funding the deal with a balance of debt and equity  we kept our LTV ratio under control  while welcoming Altarea among our shareholders. Our existing portfolio also performed well in operational terms in 2022. Retailer revenue in our shopping centres rose above its 2019 level and lettings activity remained firm  resulting in an increase of almost 3% in our annualised net rents. From 2023  the acquisitions will have their full effect  boosting our revenue as well as our operating margin through better coverage of fixed costs. Above all  we will be able to apply our asset management and value-enhancement skills across a larger portfolio. We are therefore highly confident that we will be able to increase annualised net rents to above ‚Ç¨16 million by 2025 at constant scope.‚ÄùA year marked by the structuring acquisition of two shopping centersIn late 2022  MRM acquired two shopping centres from Altarea for a total of ‚Ç¨90.4 million including transfer taxes. These shopping centres have been part of MRM‚Äôs portfolio and consolidated in its financial statements since 16 November 2022.One shopping centre is located in Flins in the Yvelines region of France  and the other one in Ollioules in the Var region. They are successful properties combining yields with value-enhancement potential. Both have a Carrefour hypermarket as food retail anchor and are leading shopping centres within their catchment areas. Integrating these shopping centres has taken MRM‚Äôs scale to a whole new level. The value of its portfolio has increased by more than 50% and its annualised net rents by more than 60%  and this is opening up new perspectives.As announced in late July 2022  the deal was funded through two capital increases totalling ‚Ç¨50 million  subscribed by SCOR SE and Altarea in an amount of ‚Ç¨25 million each. The rest of the transaction cost was financed through a ‚Ç¨42 million bank loan. This scheme enabled MRM to keep its LTV ratio under control at less than 44%.Ongoing good momentum in operational termsWithin MRM‚Äôs historic scope6  retailer revenue was 3% higher than in 2019. This strong performance was due to a 2% increase in retailer revenue for stores of over 500 sqm and a 5% increase for stores of less than 500 sqm.Retailer revenue7 2022 vs. 2019 2022 vs. 20218 Large stores (> 500 sqm) +2% +2% Small stores (< 500 sqm) +5% +7% Total +3% +3%In MRM‚Äôs historic scope  13 leases were signed in 2022  representing total rents of ‚Ç¨0.9 million and a total floor area of 4 900 sqm. The average reversion rate compared with market rental values was +1%.New leases notably include:‚Ä¢ Ongoing lettings activity at the Valentin shopping centre (near Besan√ßon): new leases totalling 270 sqm were signed  further improving the retailer mix;‚Ä¢ The reletting of the 2 000 sqm medium-sized unit within the Carr√© V√©lizy mixed-use development (V√©lizy-Villacoublay)  vacated by Office Depot in January 2022  to fitness chain On Air  with the new lease coming into effect on 29 April 2022;‚Ä¢ The addition of two Rougi√© & Pl√© stores with total floorspace of 1 100 sqm in Passage de la R√©union in Mulhouse;‚Ä¢ A 700 sqm unit in Aria Parc in Allonnes let to Takko Fashion  taking the occupancy rate of this retail park ‚Äì which is discount-focused with two key retailers Action and Centrakor ‚Äì to 100%.This good level of lettings activity increased the historic scope‚Äôs physical occupancy rate by 1.0 point and its financial occupancy rate by 0.6 point. The addition of the Flins and Ollioules shopping centres also boosted overall physical and financial occupancy rates by 0.3 and 0.6 point respectively. After retail chain Cama√Øeu has been placed in liquidation in September 2022  three units occupied by Cama√Øeu ‚Äì one in MRM‚Äôs historic portfolio and two in the Flins and Ollioules centres ‚Äì entirely offset those increases  and so physical and financial occupancy rates as at 31 December 2022 remained stable at 90% and 88% respectively.Annualised net rents totalled ‚Ç¨15.1 million as at 1 January 2023  an increase of 62% relative to 1 January 2022. That major increase resulted from the addition of the Flins and Ollioules shopping centres while annualised net rents in the historic scope continued to rise from ‚Ç¨9.3 million to ‚Ç¨9.6 million  an increase of 3%.Sharp rise in portfolio valueThe value of MRM‚Äôs portfolio was ‚Ç¨244.9 million as at 31 December 2022  a year-on-year increase of 51.2% driven by the integration of the Flins and Ollioules shopping centres.

This was mainly driven by changes in scope: the Flins and Ollioules acquisition had a positive effect of ‚Ç¨0.7 million (consolidated for 1.5 months)  while the October 2021 disposals had a negative impact of ‚Ç¨0.2 million.Like-for-like  gross rental income was stable  with new leases and indexation offsetting the effect of the medium-sized unit in Carr√© V√©lizy becoming temporarily vacant from January 2022 (new lease effective from late April 2022).After taking into account non-recovered property expenses  net rental income was ‚Ç¨8.1 million compared with ‚Ç¨8.0 million in 2021  an increase of 2.4%.Rental income‚Ç¨ million 2022 2021 Change Like-for-like change Gross rental income 10.2 9.7 +4.7% 0.0% Recurring non-recovered property expenses (1.9) (1.6) Non-recurring items10 (0.2) 0.2 Net rental income 8.1 8.0 +2.4%Unwinding of Covid-related debt waiver agreementsThe unwinding of Covid-related debt waiver agreements  introduced to support tenants  resulted in the reversal of provisions set aside in previous years.The collection rate for rents an charges also moved back to a normal level  rising above 95% for the year as a whole.Net operating cash flow 11 of ‚Ç¨4. 0 millionAs a result of the increase in net rental income  the positive impact from the unwinding of Covid-related debt waiver agreements and lower operating expenses  EBITDA rose by 5.4% to ‚Ç¨5.8 million in 2022.The net cost of debt rose from ‚Ç¨1.2 million in 2021 to ‚Ç¨1.8 million in 2022. This was due to the new ‚Ç¨42.0 million loan that partly funded the acquisition of the Flins and Ollioules shopping centres  but also the increase in the average cost of debt caused by higher interest rates.Net operating cash flow was ‚Ç¨4.0 million  up 2.7% relative to 2021.‚Ç¨ million 2022 2021 Change Net rental income 8.2 8.0 +2.5% Tenant support measures 0.4 (0.2) Operating expenses (2.4) (2.5) -2.6% Other operating income and expenses (0.4) 0.2 EBITDA 5.8 5.5 +5.4% Net cost of debt (1.8) (1.6) Net operating cash flow 4.0 3.9 +2.7%On a full-year basis  the additional revenue from the two shopping centres acquired in late 2022 will result in better coverage of operating expenses. Operating expenses equalled 19.1% of net rental income based on pro forma 2022 figures12 as opposed to 29.5% on the basis of reported 2022 figures and 31.0% in 2021.Calculated on the basis of the implementation of the new ‚Ç¨42.0 million loan at the start of 2022  and therefore of more favorable borrowing conditions than the current rates  the cost of debt amounts to ‚Ç¨2.6 million in 2022 on a pro forma basis. Applying a 3-month Euribor rate of 3% to the whole of 2022  the pro forma 2022 cost of debt would be ‚Ç¨4.4 million.Solid financial position maintainedIn November 2022  MRM arranged a new ‚Ç¨42.0 million bank loan  due to mature in late 2029  to fund the acquisition of the Flins and Ollioules shopping centres.MRM had ‚Ç¨116.7 million of debt outstanding at 31 December 2022  as opposed to ‚Ç¨75.7 million at end-2021. The average cost of debt was 2.07%. MRM‚Äôs debt is fully remunerated at variable rate and 77% is hedged by caps (with strike rates between 1% and 2.5%).The next significant redemption date is in late 2028.At the end of December 2022  MRM had cash and cash equivalents of ‚Ç¨10.4 million compared with ‚Ç¨9.7 million a year earlier.The funding scheme used to acquire the two shopping centres allowed MRM to keep its net LTV ratio under control at 43.6% at end-December 2022 as opposed to 40.0% a year earlier.End-2022 NAV per share up 1.3% compared with the end-2021 figure adjusted for the shareholder pay - outEPRA NDV amounted to ‚Ç¨139.0 million at the end of December 2022. This compares with ‚Ç¨97.4 million a year earlier  or ‚Ç¨93.5 million after the ‚Ç¨3.9 million pay-out to shareholders with respect to 2021. After pay-out  this represents a 48.7% increase in EPRA NDV. The increase mainly reflects the impact of:Capital increases in 2022  amounting to ‚Ç¨49.1 million net of fees;Net operating cash flow of ‚Ç¨4.0 million in 2022;An ‚Ç¨-8.8 million change in the fair value of properties  comprising a ‚Ç¨6.4 million charge related to transfer taxes and acquisition fees for the Flins and Ollioules shopping centres and a -‚Ç¨2.4 million change in fair value of the historic portfolio;A ‚Ç¨1.6 million change in the fair value of financial instruments.Adjusted for the shareholder pay-out with respect to 2021  EPRA NDV per share was ‚Ç¨42.8 at the end of December 2021. At the end of December 2022  EPRA NDV per share was ‚Ç¨43.4. This represents an increase of 1.3%  despite the increase in the number of shares caused by capital increases in 2022.Shareholder pay-outMRM‚Äôs Board of Directors has decided to propose to the shareholders a pay-out premiums in an amount of ‚Ç¨1.80 per share with respect to 2022  similar to the amount per share paid out with respect to 2021. This would correspond to a total pay-out of ‚Ç¨5.8 million  as opposed to the ‚Ç¨3.9 million paid out the previous year.This represents a yield of 6.7% based on the share price at 6 March 2023.The pay-out is subject to approval in the 7 June 2023 General Meeting of Shareholders. The ex date is expected to be 12 June 2023  with a payment date of 14 June 2023.OutlookWith its larger store portfolio and its relationships with a greater number of retailers and chains  MRM intends to continue implementing its dynamic asset management policy  with the following priorities:‚Ä¢ Analysing and implementing investment programmes aimed at enhancing the value of properties  i.e. both the historic portfolio and the two shopping centres acquired in late 2022;‚Ä¢ Letting available space;‚Ä¢ Implementing the Company‚Äôs ESG action plan and Climate Plan  paying particular attention to reducing energy consumption and proactively publishing a Statement of Non-Financial Performance (D√©claration de Performance Extra Financi√®re  DPEF) in April 2023;‚Ä¢ Managing the property portfolio dynamically  looking at potential acquisitions and disposals.From 2023  MRM will see the full impact of acquiring the Flins and Ollioules shopping centres  which will boost its revenue as well as its operating margin through better coverage of fixed costs.MRM confirms that  including these acquisitions  it is aiming for annualised net rents of over ‚Ç¨16 million by 2025  as opposed to ‚Ç¨10 million previously. This target is based on the current portfolio (excluding any acquisitions and disposals).Finally  MRM intends to maintain its policy of making regular pay-outs to shareholders.CalendarFinancial information for the first quarter of 2023 will be published before the market opens on 11 May 2023.The General Meeting of Shareholders will take place on 7 June 2023.About MRMMRM is a listed real estate investment company that owns and manages a portfolio of retail properties across several regions of France.

That increase was due to:A 2.4% increase in net rental income from ‚Ç¨8.0 million in 2021 to ‚Ç¨8.1 million in 2022; A slight decrease in operating expenses from ‚Ç¨2.5 million in 2021 to ‚Ç¨2.4 million in 2022; The unwinding of Covid-related debt waiver agreements in 2022  which resulted in the reversal of provisions set aside in previous years: the sub-total of provisions net of reversals and other net operating income and expenses represented an expense of ‚Ç¨0.3 million in 2022 as opposed to an expense of ‚Ç¨1.0 million in 2021.Transfer taxes and acquisition fees related to the Flins and Ollioules shopping centres represented an expense of ‚Ç¨6.4 million. The fair value of the existing portfolio also fell by ‚Ç¨2.4 million  leading to a total ‚Ç¨-8.8 million change in the fair value of properties  as opposed to a ‚Ç¨2.6 million change in 2021.As a result  there was an operating loss of ‚Ç¨3.4 million in 2022  as opposed to operating income of ‚Ç¨7.6 million in 2021.The net cost of debt rose from ‚Ç¨1.2 million in 2021 to ‚Ç¨1.8 million in 2022  due to the new loan that partly funded the acquisition of the Flins and Ollioules centres  but also the increase in the average cost of debt caused by higher interest rates.MRM also benefited from a positive change in the fair value of financial instruments in an amount of ‚Ç¨1.6 million. As a result  net financial expense was ‚Ç¨0.2 million compared with ‚Ç¨2.0 million a year earlier.Overall  MRM made a consolidated net loss of ‚Ç¨3.6 million in 2022  as opposed to net income of ‚Ç¨5.6 million in 2021.Appendix 4: 2022 pro forma figures2022 pro forma figures are based on the Flins and Ollioules shopping centres being acquired on 1 January 2022.‚Ç¨ million 2022pro forma 2022reported 2021 Consolidation of the Flins and Ollioules centres Assumed over12 months 1.5 months Gross rental income 15.1 10.2 9.7 Net rental income 13.1 8.1 8.0 Operating expenses (2.5) (2.4) (2.5) EBITDA 10.6 5.8 5.5 Net cost of debt (2.6) (1.8) (1.6) Net operating cash flow 8.1 4.0 3.9If the new ‚Ç¨42.0 million loan had been in place at the start of 2022  when borrowing conditions were more favourable than currently  the cost of debt would have been ‚Ç¨2.6 million in 2022 on a pro forma basis.

This press release follows on from the review and approval of the financial statements by MRM‚Äôs Board of Directors in its meeting of 7 March 2023. Fran√ßois Matray  Chief Executive Officer of MRM  said: ‚ÄúIn late 2022  MRM moved to a whole new level in terms of scale by acquiring two shopping centres from Altarea. This increased the value of our portfolio by more than 50% and our rental base by more than 60%. In addition  by funding the deal with a balance of debt and equity  we kept our LTV ratio under control  while welcoming Altarea among our shareholders. Our existing portfolio also performed well in operational terms in 2022. Retailer revenue in our shopping centres rose above its 2019 level and lettings activity remained firm  resulting in an increase of almost 3% in our annualised net rents. From 2023  the acquisitions will have their full effect  boosting our revenue as well as our operating margin through better coverage of fixed costs. Above all  we will be able to apply our asset management and value-enhancement skills across a larger portfolio. We are therefore highly confident that we will be able to increase annualised net rents to above ‚Ç¨16 million by 2025 at constant scope.‚Äù A year marked by the structuring acquisition of two shopping centers In late 2022  MRM acquired two shopping centres from Altarea for a total of ‚Ç¨90.4 million including transfer taxes. These shopping centres have been part of MRM‚Äôs portfolio and consolidated in its financial statements since 16 November 2022. One shopping centre is located in Flins in the Yvelines region of France  and the other one in Ollioules in the Var region. They are successful properties combining yields with value-enhancement potential. Both have a Carrefour hypermarket as food retail anchor and are leading shopping centres within their catchment areas. Integrating these shopping centres has taken MRM‚Äôs scale to a whole new level. The value of its portfolio has increased by more than 50% and its annualised net rents by more than 60%  and this is opening up new perspectives. As announced in late July 2022  the deal was funded through two capital increases totalling ‚Ç¨50 million  subscribed by SCOR SE and Altarea in an amount of ‚Ç¨25 million each. The rest of the transaction cost was financed through a ‚Ç¨42 million bank loan. This scheme enabled MRM to keep its LTV ratio under control at less than 44%. Ongoing good momentum in operational terms Within MRM‚Äôs historic scope6  retailer revenue was 3% higher than in 2019. This strong performance was due to a 2% increase in retailer revenue for stores of over 500 sqm and a 5% increase for stores of less than 500 sqm. Retailer revenue7 2022 vs. 2019 2022 vs. 20218 Large stores (> 500 sqm) +2% +2% Small stores (< 500 sqm) +5% +7% Total +3% +3% In MRM‚Äôs historic scope  13 leases were signed in 2022  representing total rents of ‚Ç¨0.9 million and a total floor area of 4 900 sqm. The average reversion rate compared with market rental values was +1%. New leases notably include: ‚Ä¢ Ongoing lettings activity at the Valentin shopping centre (near Besan√ßon): new leases totalling 270 sqm were signed  further improving the retailer mix; ‚Ä¢ The reletting of the 2 000 sqm medium-sized unit within the Carr√© V√©lizy mixed-use development (V√©lizy-Villacoublay)  vacated by Office Depot in January 2022  to fitness chain On Air  with the new lease coming into effect on 29 April 2022; ‚Ä¢ The addition of two Rougi√© & Pl√© stores with total floorspace of 1 100 sqm in Passage de la R√©union in Mulhouse; ‚Ä¢ A 700 sqm unit in Aria Parc in Allonnes let to Takko Fashion  taking the occupancy rate of this retail park ‚Äì which is discount-focused with two key retailers Action and Centrakor ‚Äì to 100%. This good level of lettings activity increased the historic scope‚Äôs physical occupancy rate by 1.0 point and its financial occupancy rate by 0.6 point. The addition of the Flins and Ollioules shopping centres also boosted overall physical and financial occupancy rates by 0.3 and 0.6 point respectively. After retail chain Cama√Øeu has been placed in liquidation in September 2022  three units occupied by Cama√Øeu ‚Äì one in MRM‚Äôs historic portfolio and two in the Flins and Ollioules centres ‚Äì entirely offset those increases  and so physical and financial occupancy rates as at 31 December 2022 remained stable at 90% and 88% respectively. Annualised net rents totalled ‚Ç¨15.1 million as at 1 January 2023  an increase of 62% relative to 1 January 2022. That major increase resulted from the addition of the Flins and Ollioules shopping centres while annualised net rents in the historic scope continued to rise from ‚Ç¨9.3 million to ‚Ç¨9.6 million  an increase of 3%. Sharp rise in portfolio value The value of MRM‚Äôs portfolio was ‚Ç¨244.9 million as at 31 December 2022  a year-on-year increase of 51.2% driven by the integration of the Flins and Ollioules shopping centres. The value of MRM‚Äôs historic portfolio saw a limited decline of 0.9% over a year. ‚Ç¨ million 31/12/2022 31/12/2021 Change Like-for-like change9 Portfolio value excl. TT 244.9 162.0 +51.2% -0.9% Financial results Rental income Gross rental income for 2022  corresponding to rents billed  amounted to ‚Ç¨10.2 million  an increase of 4.7%. This was mainly driven by changes in scope: the Flins and Ollioules acquisition had a positive effect of ‚Ç¨0.7 million (consolidated for 1.5 months)  while the October 2021 disposals had a negative impact of ‚Ç¨0.2 million. Like-for-like  gross rental income was stable  with new leases and indexation offsetting the effect of the medium-sized unit in Carr√© V√©lizy becoming temporarily vacant from January 2022 (new lease effective from late April 2022). After taking into account non-recovered property expenses  net rental income was ‚Ç¨8.1 million compared with ‚Ç¨8.0 million in 2021  an increase of 2.4%.

The collection rate for rents an charges also moved back to a normal level  rising above 95% for the year as a whole. Net operating cash flow 11 of ‚Ç¨4. 0 million As a result of the increase in net rental income  the positive impact from the unwinding of Covid-related debt waiver agreements and lower operating expenses  EBITDA rose by 5.4% to ‚Ç¨5.8 million in 2022.The net cost of debt rose from ‚Ç¨1.2 million in 2021 to ‚Ç¨1.8 million in 2022. This was due to the new ‚Ç¨42.0 million loan that partly funded the acquisition of the Flins and Ollioules shopping centres  but also the increase in the average cost of debt caused by higher interest rates. Net operating cash flow was ‚Ç¨4.0 million  up 2.7% relative to 2021. ‚Ç¨ million 2022 2021 Change Net rental income 8.2 8.0 +2.5% Tenant support measures 0.4 (0.2) Operating expenses (2.4) (2.5) -2.6% Other operating income and expenses (0.4) 0.2 EBITDA 5.8 5.5 +5.4% Net cost of debt (1.8) (1.6) Net operating cash flow 4.0 3.9 +2.7% On a full-year basis  the additional revenue from the two shopping centres acquired in late 2022 will result in better coverage of operating expenses. Operating expenses equalled 19.1% of net rental income based on pro forma 2022 figures12 as opposed to 29.5% on the basis of reported 2022 figures and 31.0% in 2021.Calculated on the basis of the implementation of the new ‚Ç¨42.0 million loan at the start of 2022  and therefore of more favorable borrowing conditions than the current rates  the cost of debt amounts to ‚Ç¨2.6 million in 2022 on a pro forma basis. Applying a 3-month Euribor rate of 3% to the whole of 2022  the pro forma 2022 cost of debt would be ‚Ç¨4.4 million. Solid financial position maintained In November 2022  MRM arranged a new ‚Ç¨42.0 million bank loan  due to mature in late 2029  to fund the acquisition of the Flins and Ollioules shopping centres. MRM had ‚Ç¨116.7 million of debt outstanding at 31 December 2022  as opposed to ‚Ç¨75.7 million at end-2021. The average cost of debt was 2.07%. MRM‚Äôs debt is fully remunerated at variable rate and 77% is hedged by caps (with strike rates between 1% and 2.5%). The next significant redemption date is in late 2028. At the end of December 2022  MRM had cash and cash equivalents of ‚Ç¨10.4 million compared with ‚Ç¨9.7 million a year earlier. The funding scheme used to acquire the two shopping centres allowed MRM to keep its net LTV ratio under control at 43.6% at end-December 2022 as opposed to 40.0% a year earlier. End-2022 NAV per share up 1.3% compared with the end-2021 figure adjusted for the shareholder pay - out EPRA NDV amounted to ‚Ç¨139.0 million at the end of December 2022. This compares with ‚Ç¨97.4 million a year earlier  or ‚Ç¨93.5 million after the ‚Ç¨3.9 million pay-out to shareholders with respect to 2021. After pay-out  this represents a 48.7% increase in EPRA NDV. The increase mainly reflects the impact of: Capital increases in 2022  amounting to ‚Ç¨49.1 million net of fees;Net operating cash flow of ‚Ç¨4.0 million in 2022;An ‚Ç¨-8.8 million change in the fair value of properties  comprising a ‚Ç¨6.4 million charge related to transfer taxes and acquisition fees for the Flins and Ollioules shopping centres and a -‚Ç¨2.4 million change in fair value of the historic portfolio;A ‚Ç¨1.6 million change in the fair value of financial instruments. Adjusted for the shareholder pay-out with respect to 2021  EPRA NDV per share was ‚Ç¨42.8 at the end of December 2021. At the end of December 2022  EPRA NDV per share was ‚Ç¨43.4. This represents an increase of 1.3%  despite the increase in the number of shares caused by capital increases in 2022. Shareholder pay-out MRM‚Äôs Board of Directors has decided to propose to the shareholders a pay-out premiums in an amount of ‚Ç¨1.80 per share with respect to 2022  similar to the amount per share paid out with respect to 2021. This would correspond to a total pay-out of ‚Ç¨5.8 million  as opposed to the ‚Ç¨3.9 million paid out the previous year. This represents a yield of 6.7% based on the share price at 6 March 2023. The pay-out is subject to approval in the 7 June 2023 General Meeting of Shareholders. The ex date is expected to be 12 June 2023  with a payment date of 14 June 2023. Outlook With its larger store portfolio and its relationships with a greater number of retailers and chains  MRM intends to continue implementing its dynamic asset management policy  with the following priorities: ‚Ä¢ Analysing and implementing investment programmes aimed at enhancing the value of properties  i.e. both the historic portfolio and the two shopping centres acquired in late 2022; ‚Ä¢ Letting available space; ‚Ä¢ Implementing the Company‚Äôs ESG action plan and Climate Plan  paying particular attention to reducing energy consumption and proactively publishing a Statement of Non-Financial Performance (D√©claration de Performance Extra Financi√®re  DPEF) in April 2023; ‚Ä¢ Managing the property portfolio dynamically  looking at potential acquisitions and disposals. From 2023  MRM will see the full impact of acquiring the Flins and Ollioules shopping centres  which will boost its revenue as well as its operating margin through better coverage of fixed costs. MRM confirms that  including these acquisitions  it is aiming for annualised net rents of over ‚Ç¨16 million by 2025  as opposed to ‚Ç¨10 million previously. This target is based on the current portfolio (excluding any acquisitions and disposals). Finally  MRM intends to maintain its policy of making regular pay-outs to shareholders. Calendar Financial information for the first quarter of 2023 will be published before the market opens on 11 May 2023. The General Meeting of Shareholders will take place on 7 June 2023.

That increase was due to: A 2.4% increase in net rental income from ‚Ç¨8.0 million in 2021 to ‚Ç¨8.1 million in 2022; A slight decrease in operating expenses from ‚Ç¨2.5 million in 2021 to ‚Ç¨2.4 million in 2022; The unwinding of Covid-related debt waiver agreements in 2022  which resulted in the reversal of provisions set aside in previous years: the sub-total of provisions net of reversals and other net operating income and expenses represented an expense of ‚Ç¨0.3 million in 2022 as opposed to an expense of ‚Ç¨1.0 million in 2021.Transfer taxes and acquisition fees related to the Flins and Ollioules shopping centres represented an expense of ‚Ç¨6.4 million. The fair value of the existing portfolio also fell by ‚Ç¨2.4 million  leading to a total ‚Ç¨-8.8 million change in the fair value of properties  as opposed to a ‚Ç¨2.6 million change in 2021. As a result  there was an operating loss of ‚Ç¨3.4 million in 2022  as opposed to operating income of ‚Ç¨7.6 million in 2021. The net cost of debt rose from ‚Ç¨1.2 million in 2021 to ‚Ç¨1.8 million in 2022  due to the new loan that partly funded the acquisition of the Flins and Ollioules centres  but also the increase in the average cost of debt caused by higher interest rates. MRM also benefited from a positive change in the fair value of financial instruments in an amount of ‚Ç¨1.6 million. As a result  net financial expense was ‚Ç¨0.2 million compared with ‚Ç¨2.0 million a year earlier. Overall  MRM made a consolidated net loss of ‚Ç¨3.6 million in 2022  as opposed to net income of ‚Ç¨5.6 million in 2021.

March 7  2023. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted  for review  the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for Dupixent¬Æ (dupilumab) to treat adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) that is not adequately controlled with the current standard of care  H1 antihistamine treatment. The target action date for the FDA decision is October 22  2023.CSU is an inflammatory skin condition driven in part by type 2 inflammation  which causes sudden and debilitating hives and swelling on the skin. Swelling  called angioedema  may occur most commonly on the face  hands and feet  but can also affect the throat and upper airways. CSU is typically treated with H1 antihistamines  medicines that target histamine-1 receptors on cells to control symptoms of urticaria. However  the disease remains uncontrolled in up to 50% of patients  who are left with limited alternative treatment options. These individuals continue to experience symptoms  including persistent itch or burning sensations that can be debilitating and significantly impact quality of life.The sBLA is supported by data from two Phase 3 trials (LIBERTY-CUPID Studies A and B)  evaluating Dupixent in two different patient populations with uncontrolled CSU. Study A was conducted in CSU patients who were uncontrolled on standard-of-care antihistamines with efficacy and safety data supporting the submission  while Study B was conducted in CSU patients who were uncontrolled on standard-of-care antihistamines and refractory to omalizumab with results providing additional supporting data.The potential use of Dupixent in CSU is currently under clinical development  and the safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About the CSU Clinical Trial ProgramThe clinical trial program  known as LIBERTY-CUPID  includes Studies A and B  two Phase 3 randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in two different patient populations with uncontrolled CSU. Study A evaluated Dupixent as an add-on therapy to standard-of-care H1 antihistamines compared to antihistamines alone in 138 patients with CSU aged 6 years and older who remained symptomatic despite antihistamine use and were not previously treated with omalizumab. Study B evaluated Dupixent in 108 patients with CSU aged 12 to 80 years who remained symptomatic despite standard-of-care treatment and were intolerant or incomplete responders to omalizumab.In addition to CSU  Sanofi and Regeneron are also studying Dupixent in chronic inducible urticaria triggered by cold (LIBERTY-CINDU CUrIADS program) in an ongoing Phase 3 trial.About DupixentDupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the IL-4 and IL-13 pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent  such as atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  prurigo nodularis and eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE).Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP  EoE or prurigo nodularis in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in Europe  the U.S. and Japan. More than 500 000 patients have been treated with Dupixent globally.Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including pediatric EoE  atopic hand and foot dermatitis  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  CSU  chronic pruritus of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About RegeneronRegeneron (NASDAQ: REGN) is a leading biotechnology company that invents  develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

The Group nevertheless maintained a high level of current operating margin and continued its industrial and digital investments to support its growth as part of its Ambition 2030. SALES Group sales were ‚Ç¨1.5 billion for the 2022 financial year  an increase of 3.7% compared with the previous financial year (up +1.6% on a like‚Äêfor‚Äêlike basis). They posted growth of 4.3% over the first half‚Äêyear  and a fall of 1.6% over the second on a like‚Äêfor‚Äêlike basis  confirming the slowdown seen since the second quarter of 2022. During the 2022 financial year  the Latin America  Africa & the Middle East and Asia‚ÄêPacific regions posted significant growth  demonstrating the benefits of the Group's international footprint. Impacted by economic and geopolitical tensions  the Eastern Europe  Northern Europe and Central Europe regions all recorded slowdowns whilst France and North America remained stable  reflecting the strength of the Group's fundamentals and positive structural trends in the residential market. The positive forex impact stood at ‚Ç¨12 million for the financial year  with the scope impact at ‚Ç¨18 million corresponding to the contribution of Teleco Automation  consolidated since 1 July 2022. Sales of the equity‚Äêaccounted Chinese subsidiary Dooya totalled ‚Ç¨297 million over the financial year  an increase of 7.6% in real terms and stable  with a 0.2% decline on a like‚Äêfor‚Äê like basis  which included growth of 22.4% over the first half‚Äêyear and a decline of 17.1% overPRESS RELEASE 7 MARCH 2023 the second  given a fourth quarter that was heavily impacted by the management of the pandemic in China. RESULTS Current operating result stood at ‚Ç¨278 million over the financial year  a decline of 7.6%  equating to a current operating margin of 18.2%  lower than those recorded in 2020 and 2021 which stood at abnormally high levels of 20.7% and 20.4% respectively - but higher than that seen in pre‚ÄêCovid periods (17.1% in 2019). Current operating result was impacted by the slowdown in sales  the significant rise in the price of raw materials and transportation costs  and the maintaining of the Group's structuring projects  reflected in an increase in related structure costs  and the upturn in certain expenses (travel  marketing). Non‚Äêrecurring expenses increased  related to the Russian‚ÄêUkrainian crisis and the expenses related to the acquisition of Teleco Automation. Net financial expense was higher due to forex impacts  and the income tax rate was comparable to that seen in the previous financial year. Given Dooya's healthy performance  the share of net profit from associates and joint ventures grew by ‚Ç¨8 million and totalled ‚Ç¨25 million. Consolidated net profit totalled ‚Ç¨238 million over the financial year  a decline of 8.1%. The return on capital employed (ROCE) stood at 20.5%  similar to the level seen in 2019 (22.2%). Note that it was 31.4% in 2021. FINANCIAL POSITION Shareholders' equity increased from ‚Ç¨1 371 to ‚Ç¨1 485 million over the 2022 financial year. Net financial surplus declined from ‚Ç¨642 to ‚Ç¨428 million  mainly as a result of the recent acquisition of Teleco Automation and the increase in inventory  in light of lower sales and the Group's desire to rebuild its safety stock  with a knock‚Äêon impact on working capital requirements. Cash flow declined by 8.9% in line with profits. OUTLOOK Following the Simplified Public Tender Offer initiated by the Despature family group  the implementation of the squeeze‚Äêout and the delisting of SOMFY shares from the regulated Euronext Paris market took place on 9 February 2023. This transaction does not call into question the Group's strategic plan  and it continues rolling out its roadmap while remaining vigilant to the still very uncertain macro‚Äêeconomic and geopolitical environment against the backdrop of the global economic slowdown.PRESS RELEASE 7 MARCH 2023 CORPORATE PROFILE Founded in 1969 in France  and now operating in 58 countries  SOMFY is the world leader in window and door automation for homes and buildings.

March 7  2023. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted  for review  the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for Dupixent¬Æ (dupilumab) to treat adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) that is not adequately controlled with the current standard of care  H1 antihistamine treatment. The target action date for the FDA decision is October 22  2023.CSU is an inflammatory skin condition driven in part by type 2 inflammation  which causes sudden and debilitating hives and swelling on the skin. Swelling  called angioedema  may occur most commonly on the face  hands and feet  but can also affect the throat and upper airways. CSU is typically treated with H1 antihistamines  medicines that target histamine-1 receptors on cells to control symptoms of urticaria. However  the disease remains uncontrolled in up to 50% of patients  who are left with limited alternative treatment options. These individuals continue to experience symptoms  including persistent itch or burning sensations that can be debilitating and significantly impact quality of life.The sBLA is supported by data from two Phase 3 trials (LIBERTY-CUPID Studies A and B)  evaluating Dupixent in two different patient populations with uncontrolled CSU. Study A was conducted in CSU patients who were uncontrolled on standard-of-care antihistamines with efficacy and safety data supporting the submission  while Study B was conducted in CSU patients who were uncontrolled on standard-of-care antihistamines and refractory to omalizumab with results providing additional supporting data.The potential use of Dupixent in CSU is currently under clinical development  and the safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About the CSU Clinical Trial ProgramThe clinical trial program  known as LIBERTY-CUPID  includes Studies A and B  two Phase 3 randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in two different patient populations with uncontrolled CSU. Study A evaluated Dupixent as an add-on therapy to standard-of-care H1 antihistamines compared to antihistamines alone in 138 patients with CSU aged 6 years and older who remained symptomatic despite antihistamine use and were not previously treated with omalizumab. Study B evaluated Dupixent in 108 patients with CSU aged 12 to 80 years who remained symptomatic despite standard-of-care treatment and were intolerant or incomplete responders to omalizumab.In addition to CSU  Sanofi and Regeneron are also studying Dupixent in chronic inducible urticaria triggered by cold (LIBERTY-CINDU CUrIADS program) in an ongoing Phase 3 trial.About DupixentDupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the IL-4 and IL-13 pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent  such as atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  prurigo nodularis and eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE).Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP  EoE or prurigo nodularis in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in Europe  the U.S. and Japan. More than 500 000 patients have been treated with Dupixent globally.Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including pediatric EoE  atopic hand and foot dermatitis  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  CSU  chronic pruritus of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About RegeneronRegeneron (NASDAQ: REGN) is a leading biotechnology company that invents  develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for review the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for Dupixent¬Æ (dupilumab) to treat adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) that is not adequately controlled with the current standard of care  H1 antihistamine treatment. The target action date for the FDA decision is October 22  2023.CSU is an inflammatory skin condition driven in part by type 2 inflammation  which causes sudden and debilitating hives and swelling on the skin. Swelling  called angioedema  may occur most commonly on the face  hands and feet  but can also affect the throat and upper airways. CSU is typically treated with H1 antihistamines  medicines that target histamine-1 receptors on cells to control symptoms of urticaria. However  the disease remains uncontrolled in up to 50% of patients  who are left with limited alternative treatment options. These individuals continue to experience symptoms  including persistent itch or burning sensations that can be debilitating and significantly impact quality of life.The sBLA is supported by data from two Phase 3 trials (LIBERTY-CUPID Studies A and B) evaluating Dupixent in two different patient populations with uncontrolled CSU. Study A was conducted in CSU patients who were uncontrolled on standard-of-care antihistamines with efficacy and safety data supporting the submission  while Study B was conducted in CSU patients who were uncontrolled on standard-of-care antihistamines and refractory to omalizumab with results providing additional supporting data.The potential use of Dupixent in CSU is currently under clinical development  and the safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About the CSU Clinical Trial ProgramThe clinical trial program  known as LIBERTY-CUPID  includes Studies A and B  two Phase 3 randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in two different patient populations with uncontrolled CSU.Study A evaluated Dupixent as an add-on therapy to standard-of-care H1 antihistamines compared to antihistamines alone in 138 patients with CSU aged 6 years and older who remained symptomatic despite antihistamine use and were not previously treated with omalizumab. Study B evaluated Dupixent in 108 patients with CSU aged 12 to 80 years who remained symptomatic despite standard-of-care treatment and were intolerant or incomplete responders to omalizumab.In addition to CSU  Regeneron and Sanofi are also studying Dupixent in chronic inducible urticaria triggered by cold (LIBERTY-CINDU CUrIADS program) in an ongoing Phase 3 trial.About DupixentDupixent  which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune¬Æ technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the IL-4 and IL-13 pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent  such as atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  prurigo nodularis and eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE).Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP  EoE or prurigo nodularis in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in Europe  the U.S. and Japan. More than 500 000 patients have been treated with Dupixent globally.About Regeneron‚Äôs VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron‚Äôs VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron‚Äôs President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite¬Æ technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create a substantial proportion of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies currently available. This includes Dupixent  REGEN-COV¬Æ (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Libtayo¬Æ (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent¬Æ (alirocumab)  Kevzara¬Æ (sarilumab)  Evkeeza¬Æ (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb¬Æ (atoltivimab  maftivimab  and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including pediatric EoE  atopic hand and foot dermatitis  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  CSU  chronic pruritus of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. INDICATIONSDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe eczema (atopic dermatitis or AD) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies.

Income Tax (0.1) (0.0) n.s. Net Result (38.2) (23.6)Jean-Baptiste Lucas  CEO of McPhy  states: ""In 2022  McPhy has achieved several key milestones towards its industrial scale-up in a market context displaying the first signs of acceleration. Indeed  large-scale projects have materialized and will certainly expand in the coming years to reach the carbon neutrality objectives set by the French government and European institutions. To meet this challenge  we have significantly increased the production capacity of our two product lines. Small and medium-capacity electrolyzers on the San Miniato site  which is now automated for mass production. Large-capacity electrolyzers through the start of construction of our Gigafactory in Belfort. As for the refueling stations  we are now located in Grenoble in a new factory which will enable us to produce 150 hydrogen distribution stations per year over time. This site brings together all our teams and is now the company's headquarters. From a commercial perspective  McPhy has recorded at the end of the year a first major contract in the industry with one of the world's largest steel manufacturers. This project confirms the tremendous potential of low-carbon hydrogen in manufacturing applications. We now have two challenges to meet: accelerating our commercial penetration and pursuing the industrialization of mass production of reliable and competitive high-capacity equipment. To achieve such objectives  our roadmap is based on two priorities: the continuation of our industrialization phase and the development of our technological enhancements. In this respect  we can count on accelerated market growth  a solid balance sheet and the support of our partners. All these elements are assets to achieve McPhy's ambition to play a leading role in the future of low-carbon hydrogen‚Äù.Return to sustained sales growth in 2022 and strong order intakeRevenue for fiscal year 2022 increase by 22%  compare to 2021  to ‚Ç¨16.1 million. Restated for the takeover of two old generation stations sold during previous years (which amount deducted from the revenue of the first half of the year)  revenue would be ‚Ç¨18.3 million compared to ‚Ç¨13.1 million in 2021  i.e. a growth of +39%. This return to growth primarily results from the execution of the first orders under the major contracts signed over the past years. Sales are split between the supply of large capacity electrolyzers from the McLyzer and Piel range (68%) and the supply of stations (32%).In addition  McPhy recorded a strong growth of +53% in firm order intake to ‚Ç¨29.4 million  bringing the order backlog to ‚Ç¨30.6 million as of December 31  2022  up +51% compared to December 31  2021.As of 31 December 2022  McPhy had a portfolio of projects signed  commissioned and/or under execution representing a cumulative 45 MW for the supply of electrolyzers and 40 stations.The Group has furthermore been identified as a preferred partner and/or selected as a supplier for a total capacity of 148 MW and 56 stations  bringing its portfolio of opportunities to 193 MW for the supply of electrolyzers and 96 for the supply of stations.Operating result reflecting growth investmentsIn fiscal year 2022  to support the expected growth in its business  the Group has continued its development strategy. This has resulted in an increase in current expenses linked to :the structuring of the teams and active recruitment plan;innovation and R&D expenditure related to the improvement of current products and the development of its new ranges of electrolyzers and stations;the strengthening of its engineering resources for the executionof customer projects.In this context  personnel expenses increased by approximately ‚Ç¨6 million in 2022  as a result of the recruitment of 85 new employees  and reached ‚Ç¨17.7 million. Other external expenses amounted to ‚Ç¨21.1 million  a significant increase due to the Group's commitment to structuring and enhancing its industrial  engineering and R&D activities (subcontracting services  prospection costs  technical expertise).EBITDA  which includes for an amount of ‚Ç¨1.6 million the share of IPCEI grant4 applicable to the eligible expenses over the period  stands at ‚Ç¨(36.8) million and is within the range announced at the time of the annual revenue publication.The Operating result is ‚Ç¨(38.4) million  with no significant difference to EBITDA  unlike the previous year. This is explained by changes in provisions related to the Energiedienst incident in 2021  including a reversal with utilization of ‚Ç¨2.6 million in 2022 (prior year accrual was ‚Ç¨4.5 million): restated for these items  net provisions are comparable year-on-year.Taking into account a positive financial result  the Net Result standsat ‚Ç¨(38.2) million  compared to ‚Ç¨(23.6) million in 2021.Solid cash position as of December 31  2022Net cash consumption was ‚Ç¨(41.7) million in fiscal year 2022  including:cash flow from operating activities of ‚Ç¨(43.7) million (excluding the IPCEI4 operating grant)  due to the change in EBITDA and a ‚Ç¨(7.8) million change in working capital requirements;this net working capital requirement is explained by the sustained growth and the increase in inventories  due to the anticipated procurement of some critical components;the initial payment of the IPCEI4 public aid for an amount of ‚Ç¨26.9 million  including the ‚Ç¨1.6 million deduction for the share taken to the profit and loss statement;the investments necessary for the Group‚Äôs scale-up amounting to ‚Ç¨(13.1) million  of which ‚Ç¨(7.7) million dedicated to the Gigafactory;the financial investment of ‚Ç¨(12.4) million in the Hype convertible bonds subscribed as part of the strategic partnership concluded in December 2021.As a result  McPhy holds a cash position of ‚Ç¨135.5 million as of December 31  2022 compared to ‚Ç¨177.2 million as of December 31  2021.Acceleration of industrial scale-up with the launch of the Gigafactory projectIn the framework of the eligibility of its electrolyzer Gigafactory project to the European IPCEI4 scheme  the Company concluded a public aid agreement with the French State through Bpifrance  for a maximum amount of ‚Ç¨114 million. Following the signature of this agreement  McPhy has made its final investment decision and received a first payment of ‚Ç¨28.5 million from Bpifrance in the last quarter of 2022. Work has already started on the commissioning of the future plant in Belfort  with a launch scheduled for the first half of 2024  followed by a gradual ramp-up to reach an annual production capacity of 1 GW. The amount of investments dedicated to the Gigafactory should be around ‚Ç¨25 million for the year 2023.Concurrently  McPhy has continued its efforts to scale up the electrolyzer part of the business by increasing its production capacity to 300 MW at its San Miniato site  in order to meet market demand while awaiting the commissioning of the Gigafactory.For the stations business  McPhy has finalized the regrouping of all the activities of this business line on its new site in the heart of Grenoble in an existing industrial building of more than 4 000 sqm. This new site will have a production capacity of 150 stations per year.OutlookThe level of its backlog and the continued ramp-up of the hydrogen market allow McPhy to anticipate another year of sustained growth in 2023.The annual financial report will be made available as part of its 2022 Universal Registration Document no later than April 30  2023  on the Company's Investor website  in the ‚Äú Financial reports ‚Äù section (https://www.mcphy-finance.com).Upcoming financial events :Annual General Meeting   on May 24  2023  on May 24  2023 2023 First-Half Results  on July 27  2023  after market closeABOUT MCPHYSpecialized in hydrogen production and distribution equipment  McPhy is contributing to the global deployment of low-carbon hydrogen as a solution for energy transition.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for review the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for Dupixent¬Æ (dupilumab) to treat adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older with chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) that is not adequately controlled with the current standard of care  H1 antihistamine treatment. The target action date for the FDA decision is October 22  2023.CSU is an inflammatory skin condition driven in part by type 2 inflammation  which causes sudden and debilitating hives and swelling on the skin. Swelling  called angioedema  may occur most commonly on the face  hands and feet  but can also affect the throat and upper airways. CSU is typically treated with H1 antihistamines  medicines that target histamine-1 receptors on cells to control symptoms of urticaria. However  the disease remains uncontrolled in up to 50% of patients  who are left with limited alternative treatment options. These individuals continue to experience symptoms  including persistent itch or burning sensations that can be debilitating and significantly impact quality of life.The sBLA is supported by data from two Phase 3 trials (LIBERTY-CUPID Studies A and B) evaluating Dupixent in two different patient populations with uncontrolled CSU. Study A was conducted in CSU patients who were uncontrolled on standard-of-care antihistamines with efficacy and safety data supporting the submission  while Study B was conducted in CSU patients who were uncontrolled on standard-of-care antihistamines and refractory to omalizumab with results providing additional supporting data.The potential use of Dupixent in CSU is currently under clinical development  and the safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About the CSU Clinical Trial ProgramThe clinical trial program  known as LIBERTY-CUPID  includes Studies A and B  two Phase 3 randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in two different patient populations with uncontrolled CSU.Study A evaluated Dupixent as an add-on therapy to standard-of-care H1 antihistamines compared to antihistamines alone in 138 patients with CSU aged 6 years and older who remained symptomatic despite antihistamine use and were not previously treated with omalizumab. Study B evaluated Dupixent in 108 patients with CSU aged 12 to 80 years who remained symptomatic despite standard-of-care treatment and were intolerant or incomplete responders to omalizumab.In addition to CSU  Regeneron and Sanofi are also studying Dupixent in chronic inducible urticaria triggered by cold (LIBERTY-CINDU CUrIADS program) in an ongoing Phase 3 trial.About DupixentDupixent  which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune¬Æ technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the IL-4 and IL-13 pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent  such as atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  prurigo nodularis and eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE).Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP  EoE or prurigo nodularis in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in Europe  the U.S. and Japan. More than 500 000 patients have been treated with Dupixent globally.About Regeneron‚Äôs VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron‚Äôs VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron‚Äôs President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite¬Æ technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create a substantial proportion of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies currently available. This includes Dupixent  REGEN-COV¬Æ (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Libtayo¬Æ (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent¬Æ (alirocumab)  Kevzara¬Æ (sarilumab)  Evkeeza¬Æ (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb¬Æ (atoltivimab  maftivimab  and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including pediatric EoE  atopic hand and foot dermatitis  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  CSU  chronic pruritus of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. INDICATIONSDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe eczema (atopic dermatitis or AD) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies.

(NASDAQ: VEON  Euronext Amsterdam: VEON)  a global digital operator that provides converged connectivity and online services  today announces its support to ‚ÄúBeSafe‚Äù campaign to protect Ukrainian women and children from the risks of human trafficking. VEON  through its Ukrainian digital operator Kyivstar  is joining the campaign by instigating a messaging system to alert and protect potentially vulnerable Ukrainians by increasing awareness and enabling reporting of risks.BeSafe is an awareness and protection campaign organised by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and Thomson Reuters to provide Ukrainians with critical information on how they can spot the warning signs of traffickers  minimize the risks and get assistance through crisis hotlines in 12 European countries.To support the initiative  VEON provides technical aid while Kyivstar launches a messaging campaign that reaches displaced Ukrainians in countries of refuge  offering advice on how to report suspected trafficking and how to find help. The messaging campaign focuses on individuals who have been displaced to particularly high-risk countries where known human trafficking is occurring.‚ÄúWomen and children make up around 90% of those who have left Ukraine and more than half of those displaced. The surge in numbers of vulnerable people means opportunities for human traffickers and we need to do whatever we can to protect those most at risk.‚Äù explains Matthieu Galvani  VEON Group Chief Corporate Affairs Officer. ‚ÄúWith Kyivstar‚Äôs focus on serving the most vulnerable communities and thanks to the collaboration of our fellow operators for roam-like-home services  mobile phones are once again a lifeline for dissemination of accurate information. We are humbled to be a part of this initiative to help Ukrainians forced out of their homes to stay safe.‚ÄùUkrainian trafficking victims in Europe are projected to increase by a factor of nine  according to a recent United Nations report. The UN has also identified the displacement of Ukrainians as one of two new factors driving human trafficking activity on a global scale.Story continuesAbout VEONVEON is a global digital operator that currently provides converged connectivity and online services to over 200 million customers in seven dynamic markets.
