The refinancing would also reduce the financial liabilities of the business by reducing cash interest across all instruments as well as by subordinating €170 million and converting €30 million of existing debt into equity. This would enable Technicolor Creative Studios to address its liquidity needs from Q2 2023 and allows operating cash flow to be focused on operational needs.A large majority of shareholders (holding above 80% of the capital) and lenders (which represent more than 75% of the debt) are supporting the Company in this refinancing  indicating their financial commitment to  and support for the business and its mission to deliver high quality projects to its customers.The Agreement in Principle has been approved unanimously by the members of the Board of Directors of the Company1 and will be submitted for approval to the Commercial Court of Paris by the end of March.Anne Bouverot  Chairperson  and Caroline Parot  CEO: “This new favorable framework reaffirms the strong commitment of all our stakeholders  in particular our shareholders and lenders  and demonstrates their renewed confidence in the long-term prospects of Technicolor Creative Studios.

As a reminder  the firm hired at a sustained pace throughout the year and expects to significantly exceed its annual target of 1 000 gross hires.The consultant utilization rate for Q4 2022/23 (January to March 2023) is therefore expected to be lower than for the first nine months of the year (74% utilization rate at the end of December 2022).Wavestone is therefore taking a more cautious approach to its 2022/23 profitability objective and is now aiming for an annual EBIT margin of about 14.5%  vs. 15% initially.The consolidated annual revenue objective of over €525m is confirmed  taking into account the consolidation of PEN Partnership and Coeus Consulting.Next event: publication of Q4 2022/23 revenue: Thursday  April 27  2023  after Euronext market closing.About WavestoneIn a world where knowing how to drive transformation is the key to success  Wavestone's mission is to inform and guide large organizations in their most critical transformations  with the ambition of a positive outcome for all stakeholders.

(NASDAQ: VEON  Euronext Amsterdam: VEON)  a global digital operator that provides converged connectivity and online services  today announces its support to “BeSafe” campaign to protect Ukrainian women and children from the risks of human trafficking. VEON  through its Ukrainian digital operator Kyivstar  is joining the campaign by instigating a messaging system to alert and protect potentially vulnerable Ukrainians by increasing awareness and enabling reporting of risks.BeSafe is an awareness and protection campaign organised by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and Thomson Reuters to provide Ukrainians with critical information on how they can spot the warning signs of traffickers  minimize the risks and get assistance through crisis hotlines in 12 European countries.To support the initiative  VEON provides technical aid while Kyivstar launches a messaging campaign that reaches displaced Ukrainians in countries of refuge  offering advice on how to report suspected trafficking and how to find help. The messaging campaign focuses on individuals who have been displaced to particularly high-risk countries where known human trafficking is occurring.“Women and children make up around 90% of those who have left Ukraine and more than half of those displaced. The surge in numbers of vulnerable people means opportunities for human traffickers and we need to do whatever we can to protect those most at risk.” explains Matthieu Galvani  VEON Group Chief Corporate Affairs Officer. “With Kyivstar’s focus on serving the most vulnerable communities and thanks to the collaboration of our fellow operators for roam-like-home services  mobile phones are once again a lifeline for dissemination of accurate information. We are humbled to be a part of this initiative to help Ukrainians forced out of their homes to stay safe.”Ukrainian trafficking victims in Europe are projected to increase by a factor of nine  according to a recent United Nations report. The UN has also identified the displacement of Ukrainians as one of two new factors driving human trafficking activity on a global scale.About VEONVEON is a global digital operator that currently provides converged connectivity and online services to over 200 million customers in seven dynamic markets. We are transforming people’s lives  empowering individuals  creating opportunities for greater digital inclusion and driving economic growth across countries that are home to more than 8% of the world’s population.

Revenue in the full year 2022 was $50.7 million compared with $79.8 million in the same period last year. The change from prior year for both periods reflects a decline in shipments of liquid cooling products due to the continued challenging business climate.Gross margin was 41% for the fourth quarter of 2022 compared with 42% in the same period of 2021. The margin in the fourth quarter of 2022 reflects a change in the product mix partly offset by a stronger U.S. dollar  when compared with the same period of prior year. Gross margin for the full year 2022 was 41% compared with 42% in 2021.""While the general business climate remains challenging  we are seeing signs of our markets stabilizing with increased activity from our liquid cooling customers. This is reflected in a strong pipeline of planned new product releases going into the year. We recently started shipping our innovative wheelbases and steering wheels with very strong feedback from end-users in the racing community. This confirms the compelling value proposition we bring to gamers and enthusiasts  and with a reduced cost base and an agile organization  we are well positioned to capture the long-term growth potential as our markets normalize "" said André Sloth Eriksen the CEO of Asetek.Story continuesOperating loss was $1.9 million and adjusted EBITDA was negative $0.6 million in the quarter  compared with operating loss of $0.6 million and adjusted EBITDA of positive $0.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. For the full year  operating loss was $5.4 million and adjusted EBITDA was negative $0.8 million  compared with operating income of $0.8 million and adjusted EBITDA of $7.2 million in 2021.Operating expenses of $5.8 million were 28% lower than the fourth quarter of 2021. The cost savings were principally due to reduced staffing costs associated with headcount reductions  reduced litigation and a stronger U.S. dollar which had a favorable effect of approximately $0.8 million. Depreciation and amortization amounted to $1.1 million and share based compensation was $150 thousand. Full-year operating expenses were $26.2 million  20% lower than for2021.During 2022  the Company invested $22.2 million in property and equipment  including development of a new headquarters facility  and $3.4 million in capitalized costs for the development of new products. The Company drew $18.6 million on a construction credit line during the year. During the fourth quarter  the Company expanded the total credit line available from its main bank to DKK 205 million (USD 29.3 million).As of December 31  2022  the Company had working capital of negative $6.3 million and non-current liabilities of $1.7 million.The Company believes that its cash position and the liquidity available from its operations  external borrowings and other sources currently available to it is sufficient to satisfy its working capital requirements until around mid-May 2023. From then on  the Company expects a cash shortfall mainly as a result of cash balances (including cash inflows from operations) being allocated to capital expenditures related to the construction of a new headquarters facility. On that basis  the Company's primary provider of credit bank has requested an equity capital injection in order to continue the credit facilities  which are necessary for the company to service its payment obligations. As a result  the Company plans to raise gross proceeds of approximately DKK 140 million (USD 20 million)  with expected net proceeds of DKK 115 million (USD 16 million)  in a fully underwritten rights issue.The equity offering is expected to be launched in April 2023 and the net proceeds are expected to be available on or around May 15  2023. In addition  Management has discussed short-term debt financing with a bank to secure financing if a shortfall occurs before the funding is received from the planned equity offering. The bank has indicated willingness to provide bridge financing for the shortfall period. The fully underwritten rights issue is subject to certain customary conditions  including finalization of the committed loan agreement and approval of the rights issue at an extraordinary general meeting of Asetek.The Company's shares have been admitted to trading and official listing on Oslo Børs since 2013. The Board of Directors of Asetek believes that it is now an appropriate time to broaden the shareholder base. In connection with the Rights Issue  the Company therefore intends to apply for a temporary dual listing of the shares on Nasdaq Copenhagen A/S. The dual listing will be temporary as the Company intends to explore the option of delisting from Oslo Børs  which will  among other things  be subject to approval by Oslo Børs and the Company's general meeting.At December 31  2022  total assets were $78.6 million ($75.4 million at December 31  2021) and total equity was $42.7 million ($48.4 million). The main factors affecting the change in assets were net additions to property  plant and equipment of $19.4 million  partly offset by decreases in trade receivables of $6.5 million associated with lower sales volume. The Company also utilized $15.9 million of cash and equivalents for funding construction of the headquarters facility  the operating loss and investment in the new SimSports business.OPERATIONSIn the fourth quarter  the Company announced its 8th generation and most advanced liquid cooling technology to date  made first available in the ASUS ROG RYUO III ARGB Series CPU coolers. Asetek also announced that its technology is powering EVGA's highest-performing CPU cooler series to date  the EVGA CLX.Six new products began shipping in the fourth quarter  all liquid coolers  two of which feature the Company's new 8th generation technology. In the first quarter  twenty-four new liquid cooling products and eight new SimSports products are expected to begin shipping. In the fourth quarter  Asetek shipped 157 thousand sealed loop coolers compared with 302 thousand in the fourth quarter of 2021.The Company unveiled several new SimSports products including Invicta™ and Forte™ direct drive wheelbases  Forte Formula steering wheels  and product bundles which include racing pedals  wheelbase and steering wheel. These new offerings  available for shipment in the first quarter of 2023  bring full immersion to sim racing for all levels of gamers. The current order backlog for SimSports products is in the range of $2 to $3 million. To expedite SimSports product deliveries to consumers and resellers in North America  Asetek established a U.S.-based hub during the fourth quarter.OUTLOOKHigh inflation  rising interest rates and geo-political tensions continue to impact into 2023. At the same time  there are early signs of market stabilization as the impact of pandemic lockdowns and supply chain disturbances start to ease. Discretionary consumer spending remains subdued  but the Company is experiencing increased demand for the Liquid cooling and SimSports products for gamers and enthusiasts  reflected also in the forecasts provided by OEM customers. However  visibility is low in the current environment  and the Company maintains its focus on cost efficiencies and product development.Considering a continued volatile global situation  revenue growth for 2023 is expected to be nearly back to normal for the Company  in the range of 5% to 15% compared with 2022. This outlook considers the possibility of further supply chain disruptions  continued general geo-political tensions  no Data center revenue ($4 million for full-year 2022)  as well as an overall expectation that the business climate will normalize over the course of the year. Operating income is projected to be between $2 and $4 million in 2023.Annual ReportThe 2022 Annual Report will be released separately later today pending finalization of the ESEF tagging audit.Conference call and webcastCEO André Sloth Eriksen and CFO Peter Dam Madsen will present the Company's results today at 8:30 AM CET and invites investors  analysts and media to join the presentation.

Revenue in the full year 2022 was $50.7 million compared with $79.8 million in the same period last year. The change from prior year for both periods reflects a decline in shipments of liquid cooling products due to the continued challenging business climate.Gross margin was 41% for the fourth quarter of 2022 compared with 42% in the same period of 2021. The margin in the fourth quarter of 2022 reflects a change in the product mix partly offset by a stronger U.S. dollar  when compared with the same period of prior year. Gross margin for the full year 2022 was 41% compared with 42% in 2021.""While the general business climate remains challenging  we are seeing signs of our markets stabilizing with increased activity from our liquid cooling customers. This is reflected in a strong pipeline of planned new product releases going into the year. We recently started shipping our innovative wheelbases and steering wheels with very strong feedback from end-users in the racing community. This confirms the compelling value proposition we bring to gamers and enthusiasts  and with a reduced cost base and an agile organization  we are well positioned to capture the long-term growth potential as our markets normalize "" said André Sloth Eriksen the CEO of Asetek.Operating loss was $1.9 million and adjusted EBITDA was negative $0.6 million in the quarter  compared with operating loss of $0.6 million and adjusted EBITDA of positive $0.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. For the full year  operating loss was $5.4 million and adjusted EBITDA was negative $0.8 million  compared with operating income of $0.8 million and adjusted EBITDA of $7.2 million in 2021.Operating expenses of $5.8 million were 28% lower than the fourth quarter of 2021. The cost savings were principally due to reduced staffing costs associated with headcount reductions  reduced litigation and a stronger U.S. dollar which had a favorable effect of approximately $0.8 million. Depreciation and amortization amounted to $1.1 million and share based compensation was $150 thousand. Full-year operating expenses were $26.2 million  20% lower than for 2021.During 2022  the Company invested $22.2 million in property and equipment  including development of a new headquarters facility  and $3.4 million in capitalized costs for the development of new products. The Company drew $18.6 million on a construction credit line during the year. During the fourth quarter  the Company expanded the total credit line available from its main bank to DKK 205 million (USD 29.3 million).As of December 31  2022  the Company had working capital of negative $6.3 million and non-current liabilities of $1.7 million.The Company believes that its cash position and the liquidity available from its operations  external borrowings and other sources currently available to it is sufficient to satisfy its working capital requirements until around mid-May 2023. From then on  the Company expects a cash shortfall mainly as a result of cash balances (including cash inflows from operations) being allocated to capital expenditures related to the construction of a new headquarters facility. On that basis  the Company's primary provider of credit bank has requested an equity capital injection in order to continue the credit facilities  which are necessary for the company to service its payment obligations. As a result  the Company plans to raise gross proceeds of approximately DKK 140 million (USD 20 million)  with expected net proceeds of DKK 115 million (USD 16 million)  in a fully underwritten rights issue.The equity offering is expected to be launched in April 2023 and the net proceeds are expected to be available on or around May 15  2023. In addition  Management has discussed short-term debt financing with a bank to secure financing if a shortfall occurs before the funding is received from the planned equity offering. The bank has indicated willingness to provide bridge financing for the shortfall period. The fully underwritten rights issue is subject to certain customary conditions  including finalization of the committed loan agreement and approval of the rights issue at an extraordinary general meeting of Asetek.The Company's shares have been admitted to trading and official listing on Oslo Børs since 2013. The Board of Directors of Asetek believes that it is now an appropriate time to broaden the shareholder base. In connection with the Rights Issue  the Company therefore intends to apply for a temporary dual listing of the shares on Nasdaq Copenhagen A/S. The dual listing will be temporary as the Company intends to explore the option of delisting from Oslo Børs  which will  among other things  be subject to approval by Oslo Børs and the Company's general meeting.At December 31  2022  total assets were $78.6 million ($75.4 million at December 31  2021) and total equity was $42.7 million ($48.4 million). The main factors affecting the change in assets were net additions to property  plant and equipment of $19.4 million  partly offset by decreases in trade receivables of $6.5 million associated with lower sales volume. The Company also utilized $15.9 million of cash and equivalents for funding construction of the headquarters facility  the operating loss and investment in the new SimSports business.In the fourth quarter  the Company announced its 8th generation and most advanced liquid cooling technology to date  made first available in the ASUS ROG RYUO III ARGB Series CPU coolers. Asetek also announced that its technology is powering EVGA's highest-performing CPU cooler series to date  the EVGA CLX.Six new products began shipping in the fourth quarter  all liquid coolers  two of which feature the Company's new 8th generation technology. In the first quarter  twenty-four new liquid cooling products and eight new SimSports products are expected to begin shipping. In the fourth quarter  Asetek shipped 157 thousand sealed loop coolers compared with 302 thousand in the fourth quarter of 2021.The Company unveiled several new SimSports products including Invicta and Forte direct drive wheelbases  Forte Formula steering wheels  and product bundles which include racing pedals  wheelbase and steering wheel. These new offerings  available for shipment in the first quarter of 2023  bring full immersion to sim racing for all levels of gamers. The current order backlog for SimSports products is in the range of $2 to $3 million. To expedite SimSports product deliveries to consumers and resellers in North America  Asetek established a U.S.-based hub during the fourth quarter.High inflation  rising interest rates and geo-political tensions continue to impact into 2023. At the same time  there are early signs of market stabilization as the impact of pandemic lockdowns and supply chain disturbances start to ease. Discretionary consumer spending remains subdued  but the Company is experiencing increased demand for the Liquid cooling and SimSports products for gamers and enthusiasts  reflected also in the forecasts provided by OEM customers. However  visibility is low in the current environment  and the Company maintains its focus on cost efficiencies and product development.Considering a continued volatile global situation  revenue growth for 2023 is expected to be nearly back to normal for the Company  in the range of 5% to 15% compared with 2022. This outlook considers the possibility of further supply chain disruptions  continued general geo-political tensions  no Data center revenue ($4 million for full-year 2022)  as well as an overall expectation that the business climate will normalize over the course of the year. Operating income is projected to be between $2 and $4 million in 2023.The 2022 Annual Report will be released separately later today pending finalization of the ESEF tagging audit.",neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.29,0.28,0.43,True,English,"['Q4 2022 Financial Results', 'Asetek', 'Money', 'May', 'Euronext Oslo Børs', 'stronger U.S. dollar', 'Positive Liquid cooling EBITDA', 'challenging business climate', 'general business climate', 'compelling value proposition', 'long-term growth potential', 'André Sloth Eriksen', 'extraordinary general meeting', 'new headquarters facility', 'financial position Process', 'reduced cost base', 'total credit line', 'new product releases', 'liquid cooling products', 'working capital requirements', 'short-term debt financing', 'equity capital injection', 'Full-year 2023 revenue growth', 'underwritten rights issue', 'construction credit line', 'Full-year operating expenses', 'Full year revenue', 'new products', 'cooling customers', 'product mix', 'cost savings', 'cash position', 'capital expenditures', 'credit facilities', 'equity offering', 'Fourth-quarter revenue', 'operating income', 'Operating loss', 'Quarterly OPEX', 'organizational rightsizing', 'Nasdaq Copenhagen', 'same period', 'strong pipeline', 'innovative wheelbases', 'steering wheels', 'strong feedback', 'racing community', 'agile organization', 'staffing costs', 'headcount reductions', 'favorable effect', 'capitalized costs', 'non-current liabilities', 'external borrowings', 'other sources', 'cash balances', 'cash inflows', 'primary provider', 'credit bank', 'payment obligations', 'gross proceeds', 'net proceeds', 'bridge financing', 'customary conditions', 'loan agreement', 'prior year', 'fourth quarter', 'Gross margin', 'cash shortfall', 'shortfall period', 'main bank', 'The Company', 'full-year 2022', 'Q4', 'negative', 'litigation', 'DKK', 'April', 'shares', 'plan', 'time', 'range', 'Asetek', 'change', 'periods', 'decline', 'shipments', 'signs', 'markets', 'activity', 'end-users', 'gamers', 'enthusiasts', 'CEO', 'Depreciation', 'amortization', 'compensation', 'property', 'equipment', 'development', 'December', 'liquidity', 'operations', 'mid-May', 'result', 'basis', 'order', 'addition', 'Management', 'funding', 'willingness', 'finalization', 'approval']",2023-03-08,2023-03-09,techpowerup.com

The refinancing would also reduce the financial liabilities of the business by reducing cash interest across all instruments as well as by subordinating €170 million and converting €30 million of existing debt into equity. This would enable Technicolor Creative Studios to address its liquidity needs from Q2 2023 and allows operating cash flow to be focused on operational needs.A large majority of shareholders (holding above 80% of the capital) and lenders (which represent more than 75% of the debt) are supporting the Company in this refinancing  indicating their financial commitment to  and support for the business and its mission to deliver high quality projects to its customers.The Agreement in Principle has been approved unanimously by the members of the Board of Directors of the Company1 and will be submitted for approval to the Commercial Court of Paris by the end of March.Anne Bouverot  Chairperson  and Caroline Parot  CEO: “This new favorable framework reaffirms the strong commitment of all our stakeholders  in particular our shareholders and lenders  and demonstrates their renewed confidence in the long-term prospects of Technicolor Creative Studios. In conjunction with the improvement actions initiated through the Re*imagined Program  this will improve the Company’s balance sheet and profitability  re-establishing its market leading position.”Christian Roberton  Deputy CEO: “Thrilled about this significant milestone  marking a fresh start for Technicolor Creative Studios. This is going to ensure our studios will be fully dedicated to project delivery and continue to be recognized as a world leader of our industry.

L.P.. Conversion of 100% of the convertible bonds 3 will give holders of those notes an aggregate amount of 33% of the share capital of the Company on a fully diluted basis pro forma for: (i) such conversion and (ii) the issuance of certain warrants to be granted to New Money Lenders and existing senior secured lenders of the Company  in each case  as described in this announcement 4 ;a super senior credit facility fully underwritten by the Lender Group (the “ New Money Lenders ”) for an amount of c.€ 110 million (the “ New Money Credit Facility ”).

Despite the headwinds that affected our supply chain and costs during the year  we were able to deliver exceptional revenue and profitability growth  underscoring the acute relevance of our strategy  solutions  and business model. Our geographic footprint grew in 2022. In Europe  our penetration deepened across all segments of specialized and food retail  and we accelerated our growth in the United States. Geographic expansion and new verticals will fuel our growth engine for the coming years. The expansion of the value-added services and solutions we provide our customers constitutes yet another profitable growth driver for SES-imagotag. In that regard  the acquisitions announced recently represent a strategic move to build the first comprehensive IOT & Data company. Our portfolio of solutions for physical retail digitization is currently the most innovative and extensive offer available in the market. Moreover  our company and our innovations are increasingly recognized as drivers of decarbonization and sustainable development in modern commerce. More than in any other year  the robustness of our business model was proven in 2022. While tackling a historically high increase in the cost of components and simultaneously facing the negative impact from a strengthening US dollar  we almost doubled SES-imagotag's EBITDA. This achievement is a crystal-clear demonstration of the road we have travelled since implementing the first VUSION plan  launched in 2018. With the VUSION '27 plan we will continue to hone our model in order to deliver exceptional value to our customers by drastically improving the commercial  economic and environmental performance of their physical stores. The business model we are pursuing will lead to: 1) revenue growth from our software  AI and data offerings; 2) continuous profitability improvements in our operations  and reduced exposure to the price and margin fluctuations of hardware; 3) acceleration in the signing on of new customers  particularly driven by the synergies that exist between our various product lines  and 4) growth and consolidation of our leadership position in all of our strategic markets. The year 2023 should mark a first major stage in our new roadmap.” 2022 Sales grew +47% to €620.9m The company's top-line reached €620.9m in 2022  a +47% increase versus the previous year  and above the annual objective of €600m.This sales progression is very similar to the +46% increase reported in 2021  marking the second year in a row of strong sales growth. The top-line increase was driven by a solid performance of +53.5% growth across Europe  which accounts for 78% of total sales. Growth in the Rest of World (ROW) regions was +26.9%  which includes the negative impact of the deconsolidation of SES-imagotag's activities in China in Q4. Excluding this impact  growth in ROW would have been 10 points higher  at +36%. In 2022  the Americas region reached its highest growth rate to-date  at +77% compared to the previous year. VAS revenue growth (+46% at €93m) was in line with the increase in total revenue. 2022 Financial Results Strong improvement in operating profit Beyond the strong growth SES-imagotag reported in business activity and sales  2022 was marked by unfavorable conditions: Strengthening of the US dollar versus the euro  especially in H2 2022. At a constant 2021 exchange rate  the variable cost margin ratio would have been 4 points higher in 2022; Ongoing increases in the cost of electronic components  which were not totally offset by price increases to the Group's customers. Nevertheless  the Group was successful in addressing these constraints and maintaining an almost flat variable cost margin (VCM) ratio. VAS sales  which are significantly more profitable than ESLs  contributed to this achievement. The variable cost margin (VCM) increased +44% to €131.4m in 2022  versus €91.5m in 2021  and the VCM ratio to sales was 21.2% in 2022 (versus 21.6% the previous year). If the strengthening of the euro vis-à-vis the US dollar – a Q1 2023 trend – continues  this will be an encouraging sign for ongoing profitability improvement. A progressive decrease in the unit cost of some components has also taken place in Q1 2023. These factors should contribute to an improvement in the VCM ratio in 2023. Operating expense increased to €72.9m in 2022 compared to €59.1m in 2021  primarily reflecting headcount additions in light of SES-imagotag's dynamic growth. As a percentage of sales  2022 operating expense represents less than 12% of the year's sales  compared to 14% in 2021. The ongoing decrease in operating ratio (operating expense/sales) over several years places SES-imagotag comfortably in line to reach the 10% target set out for 2027. EBITDA  or operating income before amortization and other non-cash or non-recurring income and expenses  totaled €58.6m in 2022  up +81% versus 2021 (€32.3m). The EBITDA margin for the year was 9.4% in 2022  versus 7.6% in 2021. EBITDA has once again almost doubled between 2021 and 2022  as was the case between 2020 and 2021. During H2 2022  despite the unfavorable impacts mentioned above  the Group was successful in generating an EBITDA margin of almost 10%. Depreciation and amortization expense increased +16% in 2022 to reach €27.2m (versus €23.5m in 2021). This higher depreciation and amortization charge is due to ongoing investment in R&D and innovation carried out by the Group. Non-recurring and non-cash items in 2022 amounted to €0.3m  compared to €-3.6m in 2021. This income is due to the sale of the stake in the Chinese joint venture that the Group had entered into with BOE and JDD in 2019. As a result of the sale of this equity stake to the company YiYun  for whichSES-imagotag received shares of YiYun  the Group recorded a capital gain of €6.7m in the consolidated accounts. This income  as well as the €1.2m insurance indemnity received by the Group following a fire in one of its warehouses in 2020  offset the IFRS 2 non-cash expense related to the free share plan allocated to SES-imagotag employees between 2020 and year-end 2022. Financial expense Net financial expense was €-6.1m in 2022 (versus €-1.1m in 2021)  comprised of the cost of the Group's financial indebtedness  totaling €-2.1m  with the balance made up of gains and losses on foreign exchange. Pre-tax profit for the Group totaled €25.6m for the year  compared to €4.1m pre-tax earnings in 2021. Based on this profit  the company incurred a tax charge of €-6.9m  versus a charge of €-2.1m in 2021. Net income in 2022 was €18.7m  up ninefold compared to 2021 levels (€2.0m). Investments € m FY 2022 FY 2021 Capitalized R&D and IT expenses 44.2 21.2 Industrial investments 4.4 4.3 Hardware as a service 0.9 2.2 Other 1.6 2.3 TOTAL CAPEX 51.1 29.9 For the year 2022  SES-imagotag's capital expenditure totaled €51.1m  compared to €29.9m in 2021. This increase was mainly due to R&D expenditures for the development and large-scale pilot of our next-generation digital shelf system. Capitalized R&D expenses remain SES-imagotag's primary investment. These investments not only fuel growth and drive the ever-increasing competitiveness and innovation leadership of the Group  but also its positive impact in terms of sustainability as we permanently reengineer products and the supply chain to reduce the Group's carbon intensity and help decarbonize the retail sector. The Group has already announced its intention to spend 5% to 7% of annual revenue on investments through 2027  most of which will be capitalized R&D expenditures.

SES-imagotag ended the year 2022 with net debt before IFRS 16 of €40.5m  which represents a leverage (ratio of net financial debt to pre-IFRS 16 EBITDA) of 0.7x at year-end 2022  and a very moderate net debt to equity ratio of 20%. SES-imagotag begins 2023 with a strong balance sheet. Other 2022 achievements Building for the future  SES-imagotag has completed a comprehensive set of quality and security certifications which now include ISO 9001 / 14001 / 27001. In Q4 2022  SES-imagotag was awarded a Platinum rating by EcoVadis   placing it in the top 1% of all companies rated  and attesting to the sustainability of the company's supply chain and its entire ESG strategy. Additionally  in Q3 SES-imagotag adopted the UN Women's Empowerment Principles – established by the UN Global Compact and aligned with the UN Social Development Goals -- as part of its commitment to promoting gender equality and women's empowerment in the workplace  marketplace and communities. During the year  SES-imagotag measured its total carbon footprint (Scopes 1  2 & 3) as the company progresses towards its Net Zero emissions commitment. Stock market indexes During the year  the company's shares – which trade on Euronext under the ticker SESL.PA – were included in the newly established Euronext Tech Leaders Index   which incorporates 100+ high-growth and leading tech companies among the 700+ tech sector companies that trade on Euronext markets. In Q4  SES-imagotag's shares were included for the first time in the SBF 120  one of the main indexes of the Paris stock exchange that incorporates the 120 largest traded companies in France  as measured by market capitalization and liquidity indicators. Acquisitions and technological platform consolidation In Q1  the company acquired 100% of the shares of MarketHub   a UK/Ireland based data analytics company  whose aim is to produce data-led insights in order to render smarter  more agile and more adaptive “self-learning” store operations. In Q4  SES-imagotag continued building out its data analytics capabilities with the acquisition of the French start-up company In the Memory which specializes in data science and category management tools for retailers and brands. In parallel SES-imagotag negotiated an agreement with the majority shareholders of Belive.ai  a French start-up specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision to strengthen the solutions provided by Captana and create the world leader in CV/AI based real-time shelf monitoring. This acquisition should be completed in the coming months. During the year  SES-imagotag also developed VUSION Engage  a marketing platform that connects retailers and brands to deliver digital campaigns engaging with customers where purchasing decisions are made at the shelf. Engage was formally introduced to the market in January 2023 at the National Retail Federation's Big Show in New York City. Outlook For 2023  the order book and opportunities pipeline support a high-level of confidence in our top-line objective of €800m. Based on the favorable trend in component costs and forex  combined with the expected strong increase in VAS  the Group anticipates a significant increase in profitability.

The results showed evidence of UCART22 anti-tumor activity observed in three of the first five patients (60%) that were treated at DL3. Overall  these preliminary data support the continued administration of UCART22 after FCA lymphodepletion in patients with r/r B-cell ALL.We are excited by these preliminary clinical responses for the patients who have limited  if any  treatment options  especially for those who have failed prior CD19 directed CAR T-cell therapy and allogeneic stem cell transplant. UCART22 is currently the most advanced allogeneic CAR T-cell product in development for ALL. We believe that our off-the-shelf treatment approach coupled with our ability to manufacture our UCART22 product candidate in-house  gives us a major advantage on the market: it potentially substantially increases the chances for eligible patients to be treated without delay” said André Choulika  Ph.D.  CEO of Cellectis.Story continues“This year  we have also presented encouraging preliminary clinical data from our AMELI-01 study (evaluating UCART123) in patients with r/r AML at an oral session at ASH 2022. Two of eight patients (25%) at Dose Level 2 in the FCA arm achieved a meaningful response including exemplary activity that was seen in a 64-year-old female with AML  who had relapsed after allogeneic stem cell transplantation and has maintained a durable MRD-negative complete response for over one year without salvage donor lymphocyte infusion or second allogeneic stem cell transplant. We are excited by these encouraging clinical data  which are a meaningful step forward for patients and support further enrollment into the Phase 1 study.In December 2022  Cellectis secured a credit facility from the European Investment Bank providing for up to €40 million in three tranches  each subject to certain conditions. In the same month  Cellectis received a milestone payment from our licensed partner Servier in connection with the Phase 2 trial of ALLO-501A  for patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma. Finally  in January 2023  we were proud to announce the closing of a follow-on equity offering for approximately $25 million in gross proceeds.This year  Cellectis remains deeply focused on the patient recruitment of its four ongoing Phase 1 clinical trials BALLI-01  AMELI-01  MELANI-01 and NATHALI-01 (evaluating UCART22  UCART123  UCARTCS1 and UCART20x22 respectively)”._______________________1 Cash position excludes Calyxt  Inc. and includes cash  cash equivalent  and restricted cash. Restricted cash was $5 million as of December 31  2022Pipeline HighlightsUCART Clinical Development ProgramsBALLI-01 (evaluating UCART22) in relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (r/r B-ALL)UCART22 is an allogeneic CAR T-cell product candidate that targets CD22 and is being evaluated in the BALLI-01 clinical study  a Phase 1/2a open-label dose-escalation and expansion study designed to evaluate the safety and clinical activity of the product candidate in patients with r/r B-ALL.On December 13  2022  Cellectis hosted a Live Webcast reviewing updated clinical data on its BALLI-01 clinical trial. Compared to the last clinical update on BALLI-01 at ASH 2021  the webcast presented data from five additional patients who received UCART22 at dose level 3 (DL3; 5x10 6 cells/kg) after lymphodepletion with fludarabine cyclophosphamide and alemtuzumab (FCA) regimen.Evidence of UCART22 anti-tumor activity was observed in 60% (n=3) of the five patients at DL3:A patient experienced a durable minimal residual disease (MRD) negative complete response with incomplete count recovery (CRi) that continued beyond 6 months  as of December 2022 A patient experienced an MRD negative complete response (CR) that continued beyond Day 70  as of December 2022 A patient experienced a morphologic leukemia-free state (MLFS) that continued beyond Day 84 (MRD-negative at Day 84).These preliminary data support the continued administration of UCART22 after FCA lymphodepletion in patients with r/r B-ALL.On December 22  2022  Cellectis announced the first dosing of a patient with its in-house manufactured product candidate UCART22. The first patient completed the 28-day dose limiting toxicity observation period without complication. This is a major milestone for Cellectis: the ability to have our manufacturing in-house substantially increases the chances that eligible patients can be treated without delay.BALLI-01 study (evaluating UCART22) is now enrolling patients with product candidate manufactured in-house at DL2 (1 x10 6 cells/kg) after FCA lymphodepletion.AMELI-01 (evaluating UCART123) in relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (r/r AML)UCART123 is an allogeneic CAR T-cell product candidate targeting CD123 and is being evaluated in patients with r/r AML in the AMELI-01 Phase 1 dose-escalation clinical study.On December 12  2022  Cellectis presented clinical data in an oral session at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) on its AMELI-01 clinical trial.The oral presentation reviewed preliminary data from patients who received UCART123 at one of the following dose levels: dose level 1 (DL1) 2.5x105 cells/kg; dose level 2 (DL2) 6.25x105 cells/kg; intermediate dose level 2 (DL2i) 1.5x106 cells/kg; or dose level 3 (DL3) 3.30x106 cells/kg after lymphodepletion with FC ([n=8]  DL1 – DL3) or FCA ([n=9]  DL2 & DL2i).The preliminary data show that adding alemtuzumab to the fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (FC) lymphodepletion regimen was associated with sustained host lymphodepletion and significantly higher UCART123 cell expansion  that correlated with improved anti-tumor activity.UCART123: 25% (n=2) of patients at DL2 in the FCA arm achieved meaningful response; one patient who had failed prior allogeneic stem cell transplant experienced a durable minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative complete response that continued beyond 12 months  as of December 2022.Overall  these preliminary data support the continued administration of UCART123 after FCA lymphodepletion in patients with r/r AML.AMELI-01 study is now enrolling patients in a two-dose regimen arm at DL2.MELANI-01 (evaluating UCARTCS1) in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (r/r MM)UCARTCS1 is an allogeneic CAR T-cell product candidate targeting CS1 and is being evaluated in patients with r/r MM in the MELANI-01 Phase 1 dose-escalation clinical study.Cellectis is currently enrolling patients at dose level 1 (DL1) (1 × 106 cells/kg) with FC preconditioning regimen.NATHALI-01 (evaluating UCART20x22) in relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma (r/r NHL)UCART20x22 is Cellectis’ first allogeneic dual CAR T-cell product candidate being developed for patients with r/r NHL.On August 1  2022  the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared Cellectis’ Investigational New Drug (IND) application to initiate a Phase 1/2a clinical trial of UCART20x22 for patients with r/r NHL.Cellectis is now enrolling patients in the NATHALI-01 trial.Research Data & Preclinical ProgramsUCARTCS1On November 3  2022  Cellectis in collaboration with the Amsterdam University Medical Center (VUmc) announced the release of an abstract on product candidate UCARTCS1  which was accepted for poster presentation at the ASH 2022 Annual Meeting.The abstract includes preclinical data evaluating in vitro activity of UCARTCS1 against multiple myeloma (MM) cell lines and bone marrow samples from MM patients  as well as in vivo activity in a MM mouse model. The potential impact of previous therapy and tumor characteristics on the in vitro efficacy of UCARTCS1 was also investigated.The preclinical data presented demonstrate anti-tumor activity in vitro and in vivo supporting the potential benefit of our UCARTCS1 first in-human study  MELANI-01  a Phase 1  open-label  dose-escalation trial for patients with r/r MM.UCART20x22On April 8  2022  Cellectis released preclinical data on its product candidate UCART20x22 at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting. The data showed robust pre-clinical proof of concept with the potential to overcome common mechanisms of resistance to CAR T-cell therapies in relapsed or refractory Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (r/r NHL)  such as single-antigen escape or tumor heterogeneity.UCART123On April 28  2022  Cellectis announced the publication of two manuscripts in Nature Communications on its product candidate UCART123  currently being evaluated in the Phase 1 dose-escalation trial AMELI-01 in patients with r/r AMLAllogeneic TCRαβ Deficient CAR T-cells Targeting CD123 in Acute Myeloid Leukemia - This preclinical study  led by Dr Monica Guzman  Ph.D.  Division of Hematology and Oncology  Department of Medicine Weill Cornell Medical College  demonstrated that Cellectis’ product candidate UCART123 effectively eliminates AML cells in vitro and in vivo with improvements in overall survival and minimal impact against normal hematopoietic progenitors.While the majority of the few CD123 T-cell therapies evaluated to date rely on autologous approaches with complex clinical and logistical barriers  this set of preclinical results strongly supports the potential benefits of the allogeneic CAR T approach in AMLTargeting CD123 in Blastic Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cell Neoplasm using Allogeneic Anti-CD123 CAR T Cells - This preclinical study  led by Professor Marina Konopleva  M.D.  Ph.D.  Department of Leukemia  University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center  demonstrated the antitumor activity of UCART123 in preclinical models of blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN).These preclinical results support our rationale of using allogeneic CD123 CAR T cells to treat AML. Cellectis’ UCART123 is the first allogeneic product candidate to demonstrate elimination of AML and BPDCN cells in PDX mouse experiments  with significant benefits in overall survival and low impact on hematopoietic progenitor cells.TALEN®-edited smart CAR T-cellsOn November 10  2022  Cellectis presented two posters at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer’s (SITC) Annual Meeting:A poster: Multi-armored allogeneic MUC-1 CAR T-cells efficiently control triple negative breast cancer tumor growth. MUC1 is a tumor-associated antigen that is overexpressed in a number of solid tumor malignancies including triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Preclinical data showed that we can efficiently generate allogeneic CAR T-cells and engineer them to overcome several key challenges of immune suppressive solid tumors.A poster: TALEN®-edited smart CAR T-cells leverage solid tumor microenvironment for specific and effective immunotherapy. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the feasibility of developing CART cell engineering strategies that can improve solid tumor targeting while mitigating potential safety risks  paving the way for clinical development.TALEN®- based gene therapy preclinical programsOn October 11  2022  at the European Society of Gene and Cell Therapy (ESGCT)  Cellectis presented pre-clinical data that leverages TALEN® gene editing technology to develop a hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPCs)-based gene therapy for the treatment of sickle cell disease  and a TALEN®-based gene editing approach that reprograms HSPCs to secrete alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA)  a therapeutic enzyme missing in Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS-I).The pre-clinical data presented at ESGCT further demonstrate our ability to leverage TALEN® gene editing technology to potentially address genetic diseases  namely sickle cell disease and lysosomal storage diseases. By correcting a mutation or inserting a corrected gene at the HSPC level  Cellectis aims to provide a lifelong supply of healthy cells in a single intervention.TALEN® and TALE Base Editors (TALE-BE)On November 10  2022  Cellectis published a manuscript in Frontiers Bioengineering and Biotechnology demonstrating the feasibility of efficient multiplex gene engineering using a combination of two different molecular tools: TALEN® gene editing technology (TALE nuclease) and TALE Base Editors (TALE-BE)A multiplex/multitool strategy presents several advantages: firstly  it prevents the creation of translocations often observed with the simultaneous use of several nucleases. Secondly  it allows for the possibility of going beyond multiple knock-outs while still allowing gene knock-in at the nuclease target site  altogether extending the scope of possible application. The precise positional rules we have determined for TALE-BE position Cellectis to unleash the potential of these technologies for future applications.Novel Immune-Evasive Universal Allogeneic CAR T-cellsUniversal CAR T-cell therapies are poised to revolutionize cancer treatment and to improve patient outcomes. Realizing these advantages in an allogeneic setting requires universal CAR T cells that can kill target tumor cells  avoid depletion by the host immune system  and proliferate without attacking host tissues. Cellectis’ research suggested that ΔTRACCARΔB2MHLAE T-cells evade NK cell and alloresponsive T-cell attacks and showed prolonged antitumor activity in the presence of cytotoxic levels of NK cells. This new cellular scaffold could enable the broad use of universal CAR T-cells in allogeneic settings and holds great promise for clinical applicationsOn June 30  2022  following its presentation at ASGCT  Cellectis published its research data in Nature CommunicationsLicensed Allogeneic CAR T-cell Development ProgramsAllogene Therapeutics  Inc.’s CAR T programs utilize Cellectis technologies.ALLO-501 and ALLO-501A are anti-CD19 products being jointly developed under a collaboration agreement between Servier and Allogene based on an exclusive license granted by Cellectis to Servier (the “Servier Agreement”). Servier grants to Allogene exclusive rights to ALLO-501 and ALLO-501A in the U.S. while Servier retains exclusive rights for all other countries. In September 2022  Servier communicated to us and Allogene that it was discontinuing its involvement in the development of in-licensed CD19 products and purporting to provide Allogene with the ability to elect to obtain a license to the CD19 products outside of the United States. We are evaluating all available options and contractual remedies to address the foregoing matters and other performance issues  which we believe may involve material breaches of the Servier Agreement by Servier. Allogene’s anti-BCMA and anti-CD70 programs are licensed exclusively from Cellectis by Allogene and Allogene holds global development and commercial rights to these programs.Servier and Allogene: anti-CD19 programsIn October 2022  Allogene announced it had initiated “the industry’s first potentially pivotal Phase 2” allogeneic CAR T clinical trial with ALLO-501A. The single-arm trial is enrolling patients with relapsed/refractory (r/r) large B cell lymphoma (LBCL) and utilizes a single dose of ALLO-501A (120 million CAR+ cells) with the FCA90 (fludarabine  30mg/m2  cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m2 and ALLO-647 30 mg  daily for 3 days) lymphodepletion regimen. The ALPHA2 trial will enroll approximately 100 patients who have received at least two prior lines of therapy and have not received prior anti-CD19 therapy. The primary endpoint of this trial is overall response rate (ORR)  and the key secondary endpoint is duration of response (DoR). Patients may receive treatment as an outpatient at the investigator’s discretion.In November 2022  Phase 1 data from the ALPHA trial with ALLO-501 and ALPHA2 trial with ALLO-501A for the treatment of r/r LBCL was presented at Allogene’s R&D Showcase. Data from the Phase 1 trials of ALLO-501 and ALLO-501A support the ability of a single administration of CAR T cells to generate deep and durable responses comparable to those with approved autologous CAR T therapies. Highlights included:As of the October 25  2022 data cutoff  the ORR and Complete Response (CR) rate was 67% and 58%  respectively  among the 12 patients treated with the Single Dose FCA90 regimen using Alloy™ process material. The median duration of response was 23.1 months.Of patients who received single dose FCA90 and were evaluable at six months  the ongoing CR rate was 50% and all CRs at six months were durable at 12 months. The longest CR ongoing at 26+ months.Phase 1 trials demonstrated a manageable safety profile with no observed dose limiting toxicities (DLTs)  graft-vs-host disease (GvHD) or severe immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS).Among patients treated with Single Dose FCA90  there was no Grade 3+ CRS. One patient (8%) experienced a Grade 3+ infection and two (17%) experienced prolonged Grade 3+ cytopenia.92% of all enrolled patients received product with 100% of infused product manufactured and released per product specifications. Patients were able to initiate treatment within two days of enrollment.Allogene has announced it is preparing for a Phase 3 study in earlier line LBCL targeting trial initiation in 1H 2024.Allogene is developing ALLO-647  its proprietary anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody intended to enable expansion and persistence of AlloCAR T product candidates  including ALLO-501A. Allogene expects that the EXPAND trial  which is intended to demonstrate the contribution of ALLO-647 to the lymphodepletion regimen  will be open to enrollment early in the second quarter.Allogene: anti-BCMA programData from the Phase 1 UNIVERSAL trial with ALLO-715 for the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (MM r/r) was also presented at Allogene’s R&D Showcase and subsequently published in Nature Medicine  accompanied by an editorial. The UNIVERSAL trial is the first allogeneic anti-BCMA CAR T to demonstrate proof-of-concept in MM with response rates that are similar to an approved autologous CAR T therapy. Allogene’s highlights include:Dose expansion cohorts demonstrated substantial and durable responses.Through a median follow-up of 14.8 months as of the October 11  2022 data cutoff  ORR was 67% in the FCA60 cohort and the very good partial response or better rate (VGPR+) was 42%. All VGPR+ were minimal residual disease (MRD) negative.The median DoR was 9.2 months  with the longest response ongoing at 24 months.92% of all enrolled patients received product with 100% of infused product manufactured and released as per product specifications. None of the patients received bridging therapy and patients were able to initiate treatment immediately following enrollment. Median time from enrollment to lymphodepletion was 5 days.Safety profile was manageable with low-grade and reversible neurotoxicity and no GvHD. Eight patients (29%) experienced Grade 3+ infections and eight patients experienced prolonged Grade 3+ cytopenias.Allogene is evaluating manufacturing processes improvements across its BCMA candidates to achieve optimal performance.Allogene: solid tumor programALLO-316  Allogene’s first AlloCAR T candidate for solid tumors  targets CD70  an antigen expressed on clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and other malignancies. At Allogene’s R&D Showcase  Allogene presented initial data demonstrating promising anti-cancer activity in the subset of nine patients with confirmed CD70-positive RCC from the ongoing Phase 1 TRAVERSE trial. Allogene’s highlights include:As of the data cutoff date of November 17  2022  the disease control rate (DCR) in patients who were CD70+ was 100% including three patients who achieved a partial response (PR) (two confirmed and one unconfirmed with the longest response lasting until month eight).Cell expansion in patients with CD70 positive tumor was robust  and there was a trend toward greater tumor shrinkage in patients with high CD70 expression.Across all patients treated in the trial  ALLO-316 has demonstrated a generally manageable safety profile with no GvHD. One dose limiting toxicity of auto-immune hepatitis occurred in the second dose level. Grade 3+ prolonged cytopenia was observed in three patients (18%). Grade 3 CRS was observed in one patient. Neurotoxicity was low grade  reversible and seen in only three patients (18%).Allogene is deploying a new investigational in vitro companion diagnostic (IVD) assay designed to prospectively assess CD70 expression levels to enhance patient selection. TRAVERSE will continue to explore varying cell dose and lymphodepletion regimens  including FC and FCA. Subject to ongoing results in the TRAVERSE trial  Allogene intends to complete planned dose exploration and initiate expansion cohort enrollment in 2023. Allogene may also investigate ALLO-316 for other CD70 expressing solid tumors and hematologic indications  or in combination with other anticancer therapies such as immune checkpoint inhibitors.Gene Editing PartnershipsIovance Biotherapeutics  Inc. (“Iovance”)On October 10  2022  Iovance announced that the first patient was dosed and completed the safety observation period in the IOV-GM1-201 clinical trial of Iovance’s first genetically modified TIL therapy in development  IOV-4001  for the treatment of previously treated advanced melanoma or metastatic NSCLC.To inactivate the gene coding for the PD-1 protein  IOV-4001 utilizes the gene-editing TALEN® technology licensed from Cellectis. This single genetic modification in IOV-4001 has the potential to enhance the antitumor activity of the TIL mechanism to directly target and kill tumor cells.Dosing the first patient with IOV-4001 is an important first step in providing proof-of-concept for delivering genetically modified TIL therapy to solid tumor patients with significant unmet needs and few treatment options.Cytovia Therapeutics  Inc. (“Cytovia”)On February 12  2021  Cellectis entered into a research collaboration and non-exclusive license agreement with Cytovia  which provided for an upfront payment or equity stake in Cytovia of $20 million (the “Upfront Payment”). On April 27  2022  in connection with Cytovia’s entry into a business combination agreement with a publicly traded Special Purpose Acquisition Company  Cellectis entered into an amendment to the license agreement and received a $20 million convertible note (the “2022 Convertible Note”)  which superseded and replaced the Upfront Payment obligation  as well as a warrant (the “SPAC Warrant”) to purchase additional shares of Cytovia following its combination with a publicly traded Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC).Cellectis and Cytovia entered into an amended and restated note  which became effective as of December 22  2022 (the “Amended and Restated 2022 Note”). The Amended and Restated 2022 Note provides for automatic conversion into Cytovia common stock in the case of certain fundamental transactions where Cytovia becomes a public company and for conversion at Cellectis’ option in connection with certain financing transactions  upon a company sale and at final maturity. In each case conversion is subject to a 9.9% ownership cap  with the balance issuable in the form of pre-funded warrants. The Amended and Restated 2022 Note increased the interest rate to 10% per annum  subject to a 10% step up upon the occurrence and continuation of an event of default  provided for the repayment of 50% of the outstanding amount on April 30  2023 and extended the final maturity date for the repayment of the remaining outstanding amount to June 30  2023. The SPAC Warrant remains outstanding  but only applies in connection with Cytovia’s business combination with a SPAC.Cellectis is developing custom TALEN®  which Cytovia uses to edit iPSCs. Cytovia is responsible for the differentiation and expansion of the gene-edited iPSC master cell bank into NK cells and is conducting the pre-clinical evaluation  clinical development  and commercialization of the mutually-agreed-upon selected therapeutic candidates. Cellectis has granted Cytovia a worldwide license under the patent rights over which Cellectis has control in this field  including in China  in order for Cytovia to modify NK cells to address multiple gene-targets for therapeutic use in several cancer indications.In November 2022  Cytovia presented preclinical data on TALEN® gene-edited  induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC)-derived Natural Killer (NK) cells at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer’s (SITC) Annual Meeting.These data highlight the progress of Cellectis’ research and development collaboration with Cytovia to develop TALEN®-edited iPSC NK and CAR-NK cells. Cellectis has developed custom TALEN® which Cytovia is using to edit iPSCs in a safe and effective manner.Primera Therapeutics  Inc. (“Primera”)On December 29  2022  Cellectis and Primera announced the execution of a Collaboration Agreement under which the companies will work collaboratively to edit mutations in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in vivo to treat the root cause of associated diseases. Primera  together with Cellectis  will be co-developing a mtDNA engineering toolbox that could enable effective therapies for mitochondrial diseases.The companies agreed to enter supplemental agreements  under which Cellectis would receive a 19% equity ownership stake in Primera and would take a seat on Primera’s Board of Directors.Pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement  Primera has a right to exercise an exclusive worldwide option for a license from Cellectis on up to five product candidates developed under the collaboration (the “partnership products”). Upon Primera exercising the option  Cellectis will be eligible for up to $750 million of development and sales milestones for the partnership products  as well as high single-digit royalty payments on the net sales of partnership products.2022 Corporate UpdatesOn December 28  2022  Cellectis entered into a €40 million credit facility with the European Investment Bank (EIB) to support its research  development and innovation activities.

Accordingly  the financial information included in this press release is preliminary and remains subject to any adjustments that may result from the completion of the audit of Cellectis’ financial statements. As a result  the financial information included in this press release may differ materially from the actual results that will be reflected in Cellectis’ audited financial statements when they are completed and publicly disclosed in Cellectis’ Annual Report on Form 20-F to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).The condensed consolidated financial statements of Cellectis  which consolidate the results of Calyxt  Inc. of which Cellectis owned approximately 49.1% of outstanding shares of common stock (as of December 31  2022)  have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards  as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IFRS”).We present certain financial metrics broken out between our two reportable segments – Therapeutics and Plants – in the appendices of this Q4 2022 financial results press release. on January 13  2023  Calyxt  Cibus Global LLC (Cibus) and certain other parties named therein  entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”)  pursuant to which  subject to the terms and conditions thereof  Calyxt and Cibus will merge in an all-stock transaction (the “Calyxt Merger”). As a consequence of the foregoing  Calyxt meets the “held-for-sale"" criteria specified in IFRS 5 and has been classified as a discontinued operation.Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Financial ResultsCash: As of December 31  2022  Cellectis  excluding Calyxt  had $95 million in consolidated cash  cash equivalents  and restricted cash. This compares to $177 million in consolidated cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash as of December 31  2021. This net decrease of $81 million primarily reflects (i) $104 million of net cash flows used in operating  investing and lease financing activities of Cellectis  and (ii) a $6 million unfavorable foreign exchange (FOREX) impact which was partially offset by (i) $6 million of cash received related to research tax credit prefinancing and (ii) $22 million of cash received related to licenses and milestone payments. Based on the current operating plan  Cellectis (excluding Calyxt) anticipates that the cash  cash equivalents  and restricted cash as of December 31  2022 will fund Cellectis’ operations into third of 2024.Revenues and Other Income: Consolidated revenues and other income were $25.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31  2022 compared to $38.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31  2021. This $12.9 million decrease between the twelve months ended December 31  2022 and 2021 was mainly attributable to (i) a decrease of revenue pursuant to the recognition of a $20 million convertible note obtained as consideration for a “right-to-use” license granted to Cytovia and the $10 million Allogene milestones during the twelve-month period ended December 31  2021  while revenue related to collaboration agreements for the twelve months of 2022 consists of the recognition of one milestone with Servier of $15.8 million  two upfront payments related to Cellectis’ agreement with Cytovia for $1.5 million and the recognition of $1 million related to a change of control of a licensee pursuant to the terms of its license agreement with Cellectis  and (ii) a decrease of $1.7 million of research credit tax due to a decrease of R&D expenses.R&D Expenses: Consolidated R&D expenses were $97.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31  2022 compared to $117.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31  2021. The $20.3 million decrease between the twelve months of 2022 and 2021 was primarily attributable to (i) a decrease of purchases  external expenses and other by $13.7 million (from $68.6 million in 2021 to $54.9 million in 2022) due to lower consumables  subcontracting costs and depreciation and amortization (ii) a $5.3 million decrease in non-cash stock-based compensation expense  (iii) a $0.9 million decrease in social charges on stock option  and (iv) a $0.4 million decrease in wages and social charges related to R&D headcount.SG&A Expenses: Consolidated SG&A expenses were $17.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31  2022 compared to $22.9 million for the twelve months ended December 31  2021. The $5.4 million decrease primarily reflects (i) a $3.3 million decrease in purchases  external expenses and other (from $13.1 million in 2021 to $9.8 million in 2022)  (ii) a $2.1 million decrease in personal expenses.Net income (loss) from discontinued operations: The $13.0 million decrease of net income loss from discontinued operations is primarily driven by (i) the decrease of $29.5 million of cost of revenue  (ii) the decrease of $4.4 million of R&D expenses (from $11.2 million in 2021 to $11.4 in 2022) and SG&A expenses (from $15 million in 2021 to $10.4 million in 2022) and (iii) the increase of $7.9 million of net financial gain partially offset by the $28.3 million decrease of revenue and other income.Net Income (loss) Attributable to Shareholders of Cellectis: The consolidated net loss attributable to shareholders of Cellectis was $106.1 million (or $2.33 per share) for the twelve months ended December 31  2022  of which $98.7 million was attributed to Cellectis continuing operations  compared to $114.2 million (or $2.55 per share) for the twelve months ended December 31  2021  of which $96.7 million was attributed to Cellectis continuing operations. This $8.1 million decrease in net loss between the twelve months of 2022 and 2021 was primarily driven by (i) a $20.4 million decrease of research and development  (ii) a decrease of 13.0 million of loss from discontinued operations (from $28.4 million in 2021 to $15.3 million in 2022) and (iii) a $5.4 million decrease of SG&A expenses partially offset by (i) an increase in net financial loss of $15.7 million primarily due to the decrease of the fair value of Cytovia’s convertible note on December 31  2022 of $7.9 million compared to a $20 million receivables on December 31  2021  (ii) a decrease of $12.9 million of revenues and other income and (iii) a decrease of $3 million in loss attributable to non-controlling interests due to the decrease in Calyxt’s net loss partially offset by the reduction of Cellectis’ ownership in Calyxt.Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Shareholders of Cellectis: The consolidated adjusted net loss attributable to shareholders of Cellectis was $98.1 million (or $2.15 per share) for the twelve months ended December 31  2022  of which $92.6 million is attributed to Cellectis  compared to a net loss of $101.7 million (or $2.27 per share) for the twelve months ended December 31  2021  of which $85.3 million was attributed to Cellectis.Please see ""Note Regarding Use of Non-IFRS Financial Measures"" for reconciliation of GAAP net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis to adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis.We currently foresee focusing our cash spending at Cellectis for 2023 in the following areas:Supporting the development of our pipeline of product candidates  including the manufacturing and clinical trial expenses of UCART123  UCART22  UCARTCS1  UCART 20x22 and potential new product candidates  andOperating our state-of-the-art manufacturing capabilities in Paris (France)  and Raleigh (North Carolina  USA); andContinuing strengthening our manufacturing and clinical departments.CELLECTIS S.A.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION($ in thousands  except per share data)As of December 31  2021 December 31  2022 (2) ASSETS Non-current assets Intangible assets 1 854 718 Property  plant  and equipment 78 846 63 621 Right-of-use assets 69 423 44 275 Non-current financial assets 6 524 8 791 Total non-current assets 156 647 117 406 Current assets Inventories - - Trade receivables 20 361 772 Subsidies receivables 9 268 14 496 Other current assets 9 665 9 078 Cash and cash equivalent and Current financial assets 186 135 97 697 Total current assets 225 429 122 043 Total assets held for sale 21 768 TOTAL ASSETS 382 076 261 216 LIABILITIES Shareholders’ equity Share capital 2 945 2 955 Premiums related to the share capital 934 696 583 122 Currency translation adjustment (18 021 ) (28 605 ) Retained earnings (584 129 ) (333 365 ) Net income (loss) (114 197 ) (106 139 ) Total shareholders’ equity - Group Share 221 293 117 968 Non-controlling interests 15 181 7 973 Total shareholders’ equity 236 474 125 941 Non-current liabilities Non-current financial liabilities 20 030 20 531 Non-current lease debts 71 526 49 358 Non-current provisions 4 073 2 390 Other non-current liabilities 626 0 Total non-current liabilities 96 254 72 279 Current liabilities Current financial liabilities 2 354 5 088 Current lease debts 8 329 7 872 Trade payables 23 762 21 456 Deferred revenues and deferred income 301 59 Current provisions 871 477 Other current liabilities 13 731 13 179 Total current liabilities 49 348 48 131 Total liabilities related to asset held for sale 14 864 TOTAL LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY 382 076 261 2162.

Because adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis excludes Non-cash stock-based compensation expense—a non-cash expense  we believe that this financial measure  when considered together with our IFRS financial statements  can enhance an overall understanding of Cellectis’ financial performance. Moreover  our management views the Company’s operations  and manages its business  based  in part  on this financial measure. In particular  we believe that the elimination of Non-cash stock-based expenses from Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core businesses. Our use of adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis has limitations as an analytical tool  and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under IFRS. Some of these limitations are: (a) other companies  including companies in our industry which use similar stock-based compensation  may address the impact of Non-cash stock- based compensation expense differently; and (b) other companies may report adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders or similarly titled measures but calculate them differently  which reduces their usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these and other limitations  you should consider adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis alongside our IFRS financial results  including Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis.RECONCILIATION OF IFRS TO NON-IFRS NET INCOME – Fourth Quarter(unaudited)($ in thousands  except per share data)For the three-month periods ended December 31  2022 2021 (1) 2022 (2) Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis (24 996 ) (26 815 ) Adjustment: Non-cash stock-based compensation expense attributable to shareholders of Cellectis 3 557 859 Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis (21 439 ) (25 956 ) Basic Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($/share) (0.47 ) (0.57 ) Basic adjusted earnings from discontinued operations attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($ /share) (0.07 ) (0.01 ) Weighted average number of outstanding shares  basic (units) (1) 45 481 310 45 653 279 Diluted Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($/share) (1) (0.47 ) (0.57 ) Diluted Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($/share) from discontinued operations (0.07 ) (0.01 ) Weighted average number of outstanding shares  diluted (units) (1) 45 481 310 45 653 2791.

In this c…,"A planned €5m capital increaseby VOGO reserved to ABEOABEO (ISIN: FR0013185857 - ABEO) and VOGO (ISIN: FR0011532225 - ALVGO) today announced their intention to strengthen their commercial and technological partnership to develop joint commercial offers in various sports segments. In this context  VOGO plans to carry out a capital increase without preferential subscription rights  reserved entirely to ABEO in order to support VOGO's development.The two companies signed a memorandum of understanding for this investment today  under which:ABEO undertakes to subscribe to a capital increase without preferential subscription rights reserved to it[1]  for an amount of approximately €5 million  through the issuance of 869 566 shares at a unit price of €5.75;Subject to the approval of the resolutions relating to the capital increase and its successful completion  ABEO  whose permanent representative will be Olivier Estèves  will be appointed as a Member of the Board of VOGO.The completion of this transaction  for a gross amount of €5 million  is subject to the sole approval of VOGO's shareholders at a Combined General Meeting to be convened on 19 April 2023.The founding shareholders of VOGO[2]  which together account for 38.10% of VOGO's share capital and 48.62% of its voting rights  have undertaken to vote in favour of the resolutions on the transaction submitted to the Combined General Meeting.The subscription price has been set at €5.75 per share  evidencing a premium of 38.55% on the closing price on 7 March 2023.The new shares will bear current dividend rights and will be traded under the same listing line as the existing shares (ISIN: FR0011532225 - Ticker: ALVGO). They will be assimilated to the existing shares upon issuance and will confer the same rights as existing shares.The proceeds of this fundraising will:strengthen VOGO's resources for international development  particularly in North America;help VOGO continue implementing its innovation strategy  particularly in the area of detecting concussions in sport.This planned operation demonstrates a shared desire by both companies to further strengthen their technological and commercial partnership. This partnership was initiated in 2019 and resulted in 2020 in the creation of the joint venture VOGOSCOPE  in order to commercialize worldwide turnkey solutions for multi-camera capturing and Live & Replay video broadcasting for various sports disciplines  training centres and local authorities.This project also stems from a shared ambition by both allies to identify and address new markets together. In a context of enhanced digitalisation of sport  their combined expertise  blending knowhow in technology and sports equipment  would help drive growth in new market segments and broaden the international reach of both groups.Olivier Estèves  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of ABEO  said: ""In 2019  we embarked on a successful technological and commercial partnership with VOGO's teams. Over the past four years  we have been able to measure the interest of operators and practitioners for our innovative and differentiated approach incorporating VOGO's solutions. We are now intending to explore new markets together  for example in professional team sports  and for us it was a natural next step to support VOGO's development through a minority stake. This is a strategic investment in line with the evolution of our markets towards increased digitalisation of sports practice and the use of the equipment we develop.""Christophe Carniel  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of VOGO  said: ""As 2024 sporting year approaches  the prospect of having ABEO as one of our key shareholders and also playing an active role on our Board is exciting. We have already been able to measure our proximity and synergies on the market  driven by our shared ambition to continue bringing innovation to the world of sports. I am therefore delighted with the new phase both our companies are embarking on today.""Impact of the proposed capital increaseFollowing completion of the capital increase  the new shares will represent 17.50% of VOGO's share capital  which will total €621 057.625  divided into 4 968 461 shares. For illustrative purposes  this means that a shareholder who owned 1% of VOGO's share capital before the capital increase would own 0.82% of VOGO's share capital following completion of the capital increase.Change in shareholding structure after completion of the proposed capital increaseVOGO's shareholding structure before the issuance of the new shares is set out below:Shareholders Existing capital Number of shares % of capital Voting rights % of voting rights SAS TWO C(1) 630 295 15.38% 1 185 395 18.91% SAS ESPE(2) 589 260 14.38% 1 178 520 18.80% Daniel DEDISSE 267 699 6.53% 535 398 8.54% Véronique PUYAU 74 600 1.82% 149 200 2.38% Subtotal Founders 1 561 854 38.10% 3 048 513 48.62% IRDI/SORIDEC 30 072 0.73% 60 144 0.96% Jeremie LR 60 144 1.47% 120 288 1.92% Subtotal Institutional Investors 90 216 2.20% 180 432 2.88% Floating 2 446 825 59.69% 3 040 679 48.50% TOTAL 4 098 895 100% 6 269 624 100%(1) 66.6% of which capital is held by Mr. Christophe Carniel  Chairman and CEO of VOGO.(2) 95% of which capital is held by Mr. Pierre Keiflin  Deputy Managing Director of VOGO.The issuance of the new shares will have the following impact on VOGO's shareholding structure (ownership and voting rights):Shareholders Existing capital after the operation Number of shares % of capital Voting rights % of voting rights SAS TWO C(1) 630 295 12.69% 1 185 395 16.60% SAS ESPE(2) 589 260 11.86% 1 178 520 16.51% Daniel DEDISSE 267 699 5.39% 535 398 7.50% Véronique PUYAU 74 600 1.50% 149 200 2.09% Subtotal Founders 1 561 854 31.44% 3 048 513 42.70% IRDI/SORIDEC 30 072 0.61% 60 144 0.84% Jeremie LR 60 144 1.21% 120 288 1.68% Subtotal Institutional Investors 90 216 1.82% 180 432 2.53% ABEO 869 566 17.50% 869 566 12.18% Floating 2 446 825 49.25% 3 040 679 42.59% TOTAL 4 968 461 100% 7 139 190 100%(1) 66.6% of which capital is held by Mr. Christophe Carniel  Chairman and CEO of VOGO.(2) 95% of which capital is held by Mr. Pierre Keiflin  Deputy Managing Director of VOGO.Legal advisorsFieldfisher acted as legal advisor to VOGO.Bredin Prat acted as legal advisor to ABEO.About VOGOIn the Sports sector  VOGO is a leading international player  with its audio and video solutions for fans and professionals alike.

Paris  8 March 2023 – Net Asset Value per share stood at €35.93 as of 31 December 2022  following distribution of a dividend of €1.13 per share in May 2022. 1. PERFORMANCE Net Asset Value (shareholders' equity  IFRS basis) stood at €1 312.0m (vs €1 380.4m as of 31 December 2021). In 2022  NAV per share declined 2%  including the dividend paid in May  after rising 25.9% in 2021 and declining 2.7% during the first half of 2022. Excluding the dividend  NAV per share declined 5.0% compared with 31 December 2021 (€37.81). The change over the course of the year resulted from the following factors: Management AccountsIn € m Portfolio Cash (Debt) Carried interest provision Other assets and liabilities NAV NAV 31/12/2021 1 476.0 59.7 (184.5) 29.3 1 380.4 + Investments 261.9 (261.9) - - - - Divestments(257.4) 257.4 - - - + Interest and other financial income (including dividends) - 4.3 - - 4.3 +/- Positive or negative change in fair value (26.9) 18.9 3.1 - (4.9) +/- Currency gains (losses) 14.4 - - - 14.4 +/- Purchases and external expenses - (39.1) - (10.9) (50.0) - Dividends- (41.2) 9.0 - (32.2) NAV 31/12/2022 1 468.0 (2.0) (172.4) 18.4 1 312.0 After taking into account a positive currency effect of €14.4m  value creation totalled €20.0m over the year  driven by companies in the Consumer and Services sectors  up €58.2m and €29.6m  respectively. They turned in very favourable operating performances (in particular THOM Group  Snacks Développement  TOI TOI & Dixi) and were able for the most part to pass on cost increases to their customers  in some cases with a slight delay. Valuations in the Tech & Telcos sector meanwhile contracted by €65.4m during the year  impacted by a significant decline in the share prices of listed companies  principally ThoughtWorks (down €53.5m)  Duck Creek Technologies (down €4.7m) and Paycor (down €4.0m)  even though their operating performance was generally favourable. 2. ACTIVITY As announced in the press release of 17 February 2022  Altamir had a favourable level of activity in 2022  against a troubled background (see the appendix for a summary of transactions realised during the year). 3. CASH AND COMMITMENTS Altamir's net cash position (statutory statements) as of 31 December 2022 was €88.6m (vs €162.9m as of 31 December 2021 and €136.4m as of 30 September 2022). In addition to this amount  Altamir paid out €29.2m on behalf of Altaroc  which will be reimbursed in April 2023. As of 31 December 2022  Altamir had maximum outstanding commitments of €680.6m (including €99.5m committed but not yet called)  which will be invested between now and end-2026  principally as follows: 2023 vintage: €254m in the Apax XI LP fund; 2019 vintage: €401.7m   of which: €260.1m in the Apax MidMarket X fund;€72.0m in the Altaroc Global 2021  2022 and 2023 funds;€48.2m in the Apax X LP fund;$20.0m in the Apax Digital II fund;€3.8m as a co-investment in Dstny ;; $1.1m in recallable distributions by the Apax Digital fund; 2016 vintage: €24.9m   of which: €13.0m in distributions recallable by the Apax IX LP fund;€8.8m in the Apax MidMarket IX fund;€2.7m in distributions recallable by the Apax VIII LP fund. This amount of €680.6m did not include the €50m commitment to the Hg Genesis 10 fund  which is held for the account of Altaroc Global 2022. Altamir benefits from an opt-out clause  under which it can adjust the level of its commitment to the Apax MidMarket X fund by €100m every six months. 4. SIGNIFICANT EVENTS SINCE 31 DECEMBER 2022 On 6 January 2023  Apax VIII LP announced the sale of Duck Creek Technologies to Vista Equity Partners (divestment proceeds: €3.5m). The transaction should be finalised in the second quarter of 2023. The Apax Digital II and Apax Development funds have each announced a new investment. 5. PROPOSED DIVIDEND OF €1.08 PER SHARE The Supervisory Board will propose a dividend of €1.08 per share to shareholders at their Annual Meeting on 25 April 2023  equivalent to 3% of NAV as of 31 December 2022.

OBJECTIVES FOR 2023 AND THE MEDIUM TERM Altamir Gérance confirms its objective to invest €170m p.a. on average  including follow-on investments  and to generate divestment proceeds of €230m p.a. on average over the next three years  barring major external events. The companies in the portfolio should continue to perform favourably  with EBITDA expected to grow organically by around 7% p.a. 7. FORTHCOMING EVENTS Annual Shareholders' Meeting 25 April 2023 NAV as of 31/03/2023 11 May 2023  post-trading First-half earnings and NAV as of 30/06/2023 7 September 2023  post-trading NAV as of 30/09/2023 8 November 2023  post-trading * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * FOCUS ON THE PORTFOLIO IN 2022 As of 31 December 2022  Altamir's portfolio was valued at €1 468.0m  vs €1 476.0m as of 31 December 2021. It was composed of 69 companies (vs 65 as of 31 December 2021). Of these 69 companies  listed companies accounted for only 5% of the portfolio's fair value vs 11% as of 31 December 2021. This decline came about because share prices declined very significantly in 2022  in particular on the Nasdaq. The portfolio as of 31 December 2022 did not include Vitaprotech  as this acquisition was not finalised in 2022. During 2022  the companies in Altamir's portfolio posted an increase of 14.8% in their average EBITDA  weighted by the residual amount invested in each company. The 20 largest investments  representing nearly 75% of the portfolio's total value as of 31 December 2022  are as follows  in decreasing order:THOM Group Leading jewellery retailer in Europe (more than 1 000 points of sale)Following record performance in 2021  THOM Group's business continued to expand in 2022  with sales and EBITDA rising 31% and 32%  respectively  over the 2021/22 financial year ended 30 September 2022. These results principally reflected the following factors: in France  THOM's attractiveness and the success of its omni-channel strategy; in Italy  successful repositioning of the brand and a positive impact from reorganising sales operations.Over the first three months of the 2022/23 financial year (calendar Q4 2022)  sales rose by 3% compared with Q4 2021  when sales were exceptionally high.Following the buyout of the 50% held by its co-shareholders  THOM Group now holds 100% of the Agatha jewellery chain.Dstny Leading European provider of secure cloud communication solutions (UCaaS) for innovative companiesDstny performed very well in 2022  with sales and EBITDA up 12% and 17%  respectively  owing to sound organic growth (8-9%) and the impact of acquisitions.Dstny entered the German market with its fourth-quarter acquisition of Easybell  a company specialised in B2B cloud communications.Value creation was activated in several ways:Rebranding was finalised  with all activities worldwide brought together under a single brand  Several experienced managers were hired  strengthening the organisation Projects focused on marketing and pricing were launched. InfoVista Leading global provider of network performance software solutionsDuring the 2021/22 financial year (FYE 30 June)  InfoVista's sales increased by 7%  as Global Networks revenue  driven by 5G deployment  rose by 6%  and Global Contact Center (ex-Empirix) revenue advanced by 20%. EBITDA was up 14%  with the margin widening by two points compared with the previous year.Over the first six months of the 2022/23 financial year (FYE 30 June)  InfoVista experienced sluggish market conditions and a disappointing sales performance. Sales rose 4% LTM as of 31 December 2022. A plan aimed at rebuilding sales momentum and optimising cash flow is being deployed.SNACKS DEVELOPPEMENT A European leader in private-label savoury snacksDuring the 2021/22 financial year (FYE 31 January)  Snacks Développement saw its sales rise by an estimated 24%  driven both by good volume growth and by price increases that were applied to pass on inflation.EBITDA also grew significantly  reflecting the increase in sales  both in volume and price terms  as well as the operational improvement plan.In December  Snacks Développement signed an agreement to acquire Burts Snacks  a UK company (350 employees  €75m in sales).Marlink One of the world's leaders in satellite communication servicesMarlink's sales rose by 10% during the year. This increase includes the impact of acquiring the Greek company HRS ($15m). Business was brisk in all divisions with particularly strong growth in Digital Services (up 35%).The partnership with Starlink will enable Marlink to offer connectivity solutions in low Earth orbit (LEO) to round out the portfolio of Digital Services it already offers to clients.EBITDA rose 19% in 2022 and included half of the expected synergies with ITC Global  the acquisition of which was finalised in the first half. The potential synergies should be fully realised during 2023.Graitec International developer and distributor of BIM (Building Information Modelling) software for design  calculation  simulation  manufacturing and collaborative managementGraitec's sales increased by 5% during the year  but a breakdown reveals contrasting developments: strong performance in resales of Autodesk Platinum and proprietary solutions  sold as subscriptions  offset the decline in the sales of services and projects  which suffered from the pandemic. EBITDA increased by 5%  despite operating expenses incurred to accelerate growth.The transformation plan has now been deployed throughout the organisation and aims to overhaul sales and marketing  implement new IT and reporting tools and boost recruitment.AEB Worldwide leader in ingredients and services for the food and beverage industryAEB's sales increased by 18% in 2022 (15% organically)  with sound performance over all segments  in particular wine  beer and food products.EBITDA increased by 5% over the year. The significant rise in raw material and transport costs was passed through to sale prices but with a delay.Robust sales growth in an inflationary context has put pressure on cash flow. Two projects have been launched with outside consultants to improve cash flow generation and optimise pricing.Odin Groep One of the principal suppliers of managed IT and cloud services in the NetherlandsSales advanced by 16% in 2022 (up 4% on a proforma basis)  reflecting good performance at Previder (up 24%)  the company's core BU  while the results of the Heutink ICT BU  which targets primary schools  was impacted by lockdowns in the early part of the year  as well as by strong competitive pressure and an unfavourable product mix.EBITDA rose by 14%  but declined 1% on a proforma basis  reflecting higher energy costs and expenses related to the integration of Pimarox and Unified. Prices were increased in July and October and further increases are expected in 2023.Odin is evaluating several acquisition targets.Entoria Wholesale broker specialised in supplemental insurance protection for self-employed persons and the managers and employees of SMEsIn 2022  Entoria's revenue was equal to that of 2021  as the customer portfolio stabilised and commission rates improved. New health and income protection policies were successfully launched in the third quarter  and brokers were pleased by the significant improvement in service (very low attrition rate in Q4). Lastly  new insurers/reinsurers have been integrated into the range of policies offered.Owing to cost-cutting efforts  EBITDA was up 23% compared with 2021.Opteven A European platform for insurance products and services dedicated to mobilityAmid a French used vehicles market down 13%  Opteven's sales were underpinned by favourable momentum in the maintenance and mechanical breakdown warranty business  as well as by price increases. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be up 15% over the full year  owing to measures implemented to improve profitability.With the automotive market set to remain difficult in 2023  volumes linked to contracts already signed as well as price increases should drive Opteven's performance.Management has identified a certain number of attractive targets for future build-ups.Lastly  Opteven will benefit from the experience and contacts of Renault's former no. 3  who has joined the company's board of directors.Crystal One of France's leaders in wealth management advisory servicesAgainst an unfavourable macroeconomic background  Crystal's revenue rose 44% over the year including acquisitions (and was stable at constant scope)  while EBITDA jumped 55%. Over the last two years  acquisition-related synergies and operational excellence has widened the margin by 300 bps  which stood at 25% over all of 2022.Crystal has carried out 19 significant build-ups since Apax acquired the company  including five in 2022  making it a nationwide wealth management platform.Digital transformation picked up speed in 2022  following deployment of software acquired in September 2021 and the appointment of a CDO in September 2022. The management team is being structured and has launched an ambitious transformation plan that includes digitalising the customer experience and automating processes.Odigo Leader in Contact Center as a Service (CCaaS) solutions intended principally for large companiesOdigo's revenue declined by 3% during the year  as economic conditions were less robust than in 2021  two significant projects were postponed and a lot of resources were devoted to migrating to a SaaS model  which has been operational since the fourth quarter. As of end-2022  115 clients  i.e. 85% of the eligible clientele  had already migrated  compared with an initial objective of 50%.Deployment of the new model temporarily weighed on EBITDA (down 30% in 2022 vs 2021)  but will generate significant cost reductions. These savings started to materialise in the fourth quarter  when 89 outsourcing contracts were terminated.Mentaal Beter Leading provider of outpatient services for mental health problems of light-to-moderate severityMentaal Beter's sales increased by 55% during the year (6% organically)  driven by an increase in the number of therapists  despite a still-high absentee rate. Against a background of strong demand for mental healthcare  Mentaal Beter has taken steps to optimise appointment scheduling and has digitised administrative tasks. These improvements  as well as a significant contribution from HSK  acquired in February 2022  are expected to support the topline.A new CEO has been appointed to carry out the operational improvement plan  with the current CEO remaining in the company as Chief Medical Officer.Thoughtworks Leading digital transformation and software development companyDespite the negative impact of exchange rates  ThoughtWorks turned in a strong performance in 2022  posting a 26% rise in revenue (YTD 30/09/2022 vs YTD 30/09/2021)  mostly due to organic growth. ThoughtWorks also successfully integrated two companies acquired in 2022: Connected  a Toronto-based software solutions company  and Handmade  a Brazilian company known for its ability to use an agile development model for its clients' projects. EBITDA was up 16% during the nine months to 30 September (vs YTD 30/09/2021).ThoughtWorks's valuation suffered from the decline in its share price  as did the entire technology sector.Assured Partners One of the largest independent insurance brokers in the United StatesLTM revenue advanced by 18%  reflecting both organic growth (5%)  driven in turn principally by property & casualty and income protection insurance activities  and by acquisitions.The EBITDA margin contracted principally because of investments in IT projects  increased travel expenses and costs incurred to create the Large Companies division.Assured Partners continued to make acquisitions in 2022  but fewer than in 2021.Expereo Global internet connectivity and managed services providerExpereo delivered sound performance in 2022  with sales and EBITDA up 13% and 19% over the year  respectively. This performance reflected strong growth in high valued-added segments (SD WAN and XCA) and a significant increase in direct sales to large accounts. Direct sales accounted for 60% of the order book at end-2022  vs 13% in 2018  the year the company was acquired.The company is considering several potential acquisitions  particularly in the United States  to round out its product portfolio.ADCO European leader in the leasing  installation and maintenance of mobile toiletsThe sales and EBITDA of ADCO (Toi Toi and Dixi brands) rose 17% and 22%  respectively  as of end-October 2022 (YTD 31/10/2022 vs YTD 31/10/2021)  driven by (i) the value-creation plans Apax has implemented since it acquired to company at the end of 2019  in particular with regard to market positioning and pricing  (ii) the emergence of new  Covid-related sanitary equipment needs  in particular at construction sites in Germany  and (iii) the post-confinement return of concerts and other outdoor events.Candela A leading US company specialised in energy-based  innovative solutions for non-surgical aesthetic applications  including treatment of vascular and pigmented lesions  tattoo removal and laser hair removalCandela's sales grew by 14% over the year (21% at constant exchange rates)  reflecting robust business growth in all of the company's markets in a complex macroeconomic context (inflation  lockdowns in China and supply chain disruption).The EBITDA margin widened  reflecting both increased sales and the impact of the cost reduction programmes management has implemented.PIB Group An insurance broker based in the United Kingdom with a presence in continental EuropeSales and EBITDA rose 41% and 36%  respectively  over the year  reflecting both organic growth and the integration of new companies acquired internationally.Management has been strengthened with a CEO for Europe and a new CFO  as well as new senior positions that have been created to round out the team.Efficy A European leader in CRM softwareRevenue rose by 6% during the year  driven by double-digit growth in CRM revenue (Efficy's historical business)  partly offset by the decline in revenue from marketing automation (Apsis's historical business)  as clients transitioned to a new platform. EBITDA growth of 23% in 2022 included the accretive impact of the acquisition of Apsis.The technology platform bringing together CRM functionality for the entire group was finalised in 2022  and marketing started in 2023.Efficy is recruiting for several key positions to strengthen its organisation.About Altamir Altamir is a listed private equity company (Euronext Paris-B  ticker: LTA) founded in 1995  with a NAV of more than €1.3bn.

The results showed evidence of UCART22 anti-tumor activity observed in three of the first five patients (60%) that were treated at DL3. Overall  these preliminary data support the continued administration of UCART22 after FCA lymphodepletion in patients with r/r B-cell ALL.We are excited by these preliminary clinical responses for the patients who have limited  if any  treatment options  especially for those who have failed prior CD19 directed CAR T-cell therapy and allogeneic stem cell transplant. UCART22 is currently the most advanced allogeneic CAR T-cell product in development for ALL. We believe that our off-the-shelf treatment approach coupled with our ability to manufacture our UCART22 product candidate in-house  gives us a major advantage on the market: it potentially substantially increases the chances for eligible patients to be treated without delay” said André Choulika  Ph.D.  CEO of Cellectis.“This year  we have also presented encouraging preliminary clinical data from our AMELI-01 study (evaluating UCART123) in patients with r/r AML at an oral session at ASH 2022. Two of eight patients (25%) at Dose Level 2 in the FCA arm achieved a meaningful response including exemplary activity that was seen in a 64-year-old female with AML  who had relapsed after allogeneic stem cell transplantation and has maintained a durable MRD-negative complete response for over one year without salvage donor lymphocyte infusion or second allogeneic stem cell transplant. We are excited by these encouraging clinical data  which are a meaningful step forward for patients and support further enrollment into the Phase 1 study.In December 2022  Cellectis secured a credit facility from the European Investment Bank providing for up to €40 million in three tranches  each subject to certain conditions. In the same month  Cellectis received a milestone payment from our licensed partner Servier in connection with the Phase 2 trial of ALLO-501A  for patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma. Finally  in January 2023  we were proud to announce the closing of a follow-on equity offering for approximately $25 million in gross proceeds.This year  Cellectis remains deeply focused on the patient recruitment of its four ongoing Phase 1 clinical trials BALLI-01  AMELI-01  MELANI-01 and NATHALI-01 (evaluating UCART22  UCART123  UCARTCS1 and UCART20x22 respectively)”._______________________1 Cash position excludes Calyxt  Inc. and includes cash  cash equivalent  and restricted cash. Restricted cash was $5 million as of December 31  2022Pipeline HighlightsUCART Clinical Development ProgramsBALLI-01 (evaluating UCART22) in relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (r/r B-ALL)UCART22 is an allogeneic CAR T-cell product candidate that targets CD22 and is being evaluated in the BALLI-01 clinical study  a Phase 1/2a open-label dose-escalation and expansion study designed to evaluate the safety and clinical activity of the product candidate in patients with r/r B-ALL.On December 13  2022  Cellectis hosted a Live Webcast reviewing updated clinical data on its BALLI-01 clinical trial. Compared to the last clinical update on BALLI-01 at ASH 2021  the webcast presented data from five additional patients who received UCART22 at dose level 3 (DL3; 5x10 6 cells/kg) after lymphodepletion with fludarabine cyclophosphamide and alemtuzumab (FCA) regimen.Evidence of UCART22 anti-tumor activity was observed in 60% (n=3) of the five patients at DL3:A patient experienced a durable minimal residual disease (MRD) negative complete response with incomplete count recovery (CRi) that continued beyond 6 months  as of December 2022 A patient experienced an MRD negative complete response (CR) that continued beyond Day 70  as of December 2022 A patient experienced a morphologic leukemia-free state (MLFS) that continued beyond Day 84 (MRD-negative at Day 84).These preliminary data support the continued administration of UCART22 after FCA lymphodepletion in patients with r/r B-ALL.On December 22  2022  Cellectis announced the first dosing of a patient with its in-house manufactured product candidate UCART22. The first patient completed the 28-day dose limiting toxicity observation period without complication. This is a major milestone for Cellectis: the ability to have our manufacturing in-house substantially increases the chances that eligible patients can be treated without delay.BALLI-01 study (evaluating UCART22) is now enrolling patients with product candidate manufactured in-house at DL2 (1 x10 6 cells/kg) after FCA lymphodepletion.AMELI-01 (evaluating UCART123) in relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (r/r AML)UCART123 is an allogeneic CAR T-cell product candidate targeting CD123 and is being evaluated in patients with r/r AML in the AMELI-01 Phase 1 dose-escalation clinical study.On December 12  2022  Cellectis presented clinical data in an oral session at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) on its AMELI-01 clinical trial.The oral presentation reviewed preliminary data from patients who received UCART123 at one of the following dose levels: dose level 1 (DL1) 2.5x105 cells/kg; dose level 2 (DL2) 6.25x105 cells/kg; intermediate dose level 2 (DL2i) 1.5x106 cells/kg; or dose level 3 (DL3) 3.30x106 cells/kg after lymphodepletion with FC ([n=8]  DL1 – DL3) or FCA ([n=9]  DL2 & DL2i).The preliminary data show that adding alemtuzumab to the fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (FC) lymphodepletion regimen was associated with sustained host lymphodepletion and significantly higher UCART123 cell expansion  that correlated with improved anti-tumor activity.UCART123: 25% (n=2) of patients at DL2 in the FCA arm achieved meaningful response; one patient who had failed prior allogeneic stem cell transplant experienced a durable minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative complete response that continued beyond 12 months  as of December 2022.Overall  these preliminary data support the continued administration of UCART123 after FCA lymphodepletion in patients with r/r AML.AMELI-01 study is now enrolling patients in a two-dose regimen arm at DL2.MELANI-01 (evaluating UCARTCS1) in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (r/r MM)UCARTCS1 is an allogeneic CAR T-cell product candidate targeting CS1 and is being evaluated in patients with r/r MM in the MELANI-01 Phase 1 dose-escalation clinical study.Cellectis is currently enrolling patients at dose level 1 (DL1) (1 × 106 cells/kg) with FC preconditioning regimen.NATHALI-01 (evaluating UCART20x22) in relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma (r/r NHL)UCART20x22 is Cellectis’ first allogeneic dual CAR T-cell product candidate being developed for patients with r/r NHL.On August 1  2022  the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared Cellectis’ Investigational New Drug (IND) application to initiate a Phase 1/2a clinical trial of UCART20x22 for patients with r/r NHL.Cellectis is now enrolling patients in the NATHALI-01 trial.Research Data & Preclinical ProgramsUCARTCS1On November 3  2022  Cellectis in collaboration with the Amsterdam University Medical Center (VUmc) announced the release of an abstract on product candidate UCARTCS1  which was accepted for poster presentation at the ASH 2022 Annual Meeting.The abstract includes preclinical data evaluating in vitro activity of UCARTCS1 against multiple myeloma (MM) cell lines and bone marrow samples from MM patients  as well as in vivo activity in a MM mouse model. The potential impact of previous therapy and tumor characteristics on the in vitro efficacy of UCARTCS1 was also investigated.The preclinical data presented demonstrate anti-tumor activity in vitro and in vivo supporting the potential benefit of our UCARTCS1 first in-human study  MELANI-01  a Phase 1  open-label  dose-escalation trial for patients with r/r MM.UCART20x22On April 8  2022  Cellectis released preclinical data on its product candidate UCART20x22 at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting. The data showed robust pre-clinical proof of concept with the potential to overcome common mechanisms of resistance to CAR T-cell therapies in relapsed or refractory Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (r/r NHL)  such as single-antigen escape or tumor heterogeneity.UCART123On April 28  2022  Cellectis announced the publication of two manuscripts in Nature Communications on its product candidate UCART123  currently being evaluated in the Phase 1 dose-escalation trial AMELI-01 in patients with r/r AMLAllogeneic TCRαβ Deficient CAR T-cells Targeting CD123 in Acute Myeloid Leukemia - This preclinical study  led by Dr Monica Guzman  Ph.D.  Division of Hematology and Oncology  Department of Medicine Weill Cornell Medical College  demonstrated that Cellectis’ product candidate UCART123 effectively eliminates AML cells in vitro and in vivo with improvements in overall survival and minimal impact against normal hematopoietic progenitors.While the majority of the few CD123 T-cell therapies evaluated to date rely on autologous approaches with complex clinical and logistical barriers  this set of preclinical results strongly supports the potential benefits of the allogeneic CAR T approach in AMLTargeting CD123 in Blastic Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cell Neoplasm using Allogeneic Anti-CD123 CAR T Cells - This preclinical study  led by Professor Marina Konopleva  M.D.  Ph.D.  Department of Leukemia  University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center  demonstrated the antitumor activity of UCART123 in preclinical models of blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN).These preclinical results support our rationale of using allogeneic CD123 CAR T cells to treat AML. Cellectis’ UCART123 is the first allogeneic product candidate to demonstrate elimination of AML and BPDCN cells in PDX mouse experiments  with significant benefits in overall survival and low impact on hematopoietic progenitor cells.TALEN®-edited smart CAR T-cellsOn November 10  2022  Cellectis presented two posters at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer’s (SITC) Annual Meeting:A poster: Multi-armored allogeneic MUC-1 CAR T-cells efficiently control triple negative breast cancer tumor growth. MUC1 is a tumor-associated antigen that is overexpressed in a number of solid tumor malignancies including triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Preclinical data showed that we can efficiently generate allogeneic CAR T-cells and engineer them to overcome several key challenges of immune suppressive solid tumors.A poster: TALEN®-edited smart CAR T-cells leverage solid tumor microenvironment for specific and effective immunotherapy. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the feasibility of developing CART cell engineering strategies that can improve solid tumor targeting while mitigating potential safety risks  paving the way for clinical development.TALEN®- based gene therapy preclinical programsOn October 11  2022  at the European Society of Gene and Cell Therapy (ESGCT)  Cellectis presented pre-clinical data that leverages TALEN® gene editing technology to develop a hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPCs)-based gene therapy for the treatment of sickle cell disease  and a TALEN®-based gene editing approach that reprograms HSPCs to secrete alpha-L-iduronidase (IDUA)  a therapeutic enzyme missing in Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS-I).The pre-clinical data presented at ESGCT further demonstrate our ability to leverage TALEN® gene editing technology to potentially address genetic diseases  namely sickle cell disease and lysosomal storage diseases. By correcting a mutation or inserting a corrected gene at the HSPC level  Cellectis aims to provide a lifelong supply of healthy cells in a single intervention.TALEN® and TALE Base Editors (TALE-BE)On November 10  2022  Cellectis published a manuscript in Frontiers Bioengineering and Biotechnology demonstrating the feasibility of efficient multiplex gene engineering using a combination of two different molecular tools: TALEN® gene editing technology (TALE nuclease) and TALE Base Editors (TALE-BE)A multiplex/multitool strategy presents several advantages: firstly  it prevents the creation of translocations often observed with the simultaneous use of several nucleases. Secondly  it allows for the possibility of going beyond multiple knock-outs while still allowing gene knock-in at the nuclease target site  altogether extending the scope of possible application. The precise positional rules we have determined for TALE-BE position Cellectis to unleash the potential of these technologies for future applications.Novel Immune-Evasive Universal Allogeneic CAR T-cellsUniversal CAR T-cell therapies are poised to revolutionize cancer treatment and to improve patient outcomes. Realizing these advantages in an allogeneic setting requires universal CAR T cells that can kill target tumor cells  avoid depletion by the host immune system  and proliferate without attacking host tissues. Cellectis’ research suggested that ΔTRACCARΔB2MHLAE T-cells evade NK cell and alloresponsive T-cell attacks and showed prolonged antitumor activity in the presence of cytotoxic levels of NK cells. This new cellular scaffold could enable the broad use of universal CAR T-cells in allogeneic settings and holds great promise for clinical applicationsOn June 30  2022  following its presentation at ASGCT  Cellectis published its research data in Nature CommunicationsLicensed Allogeneic CAR T-cell Development ProgramsAllogene Therapeutics  Inc.’s CAR T programs utilize Cellectis technologies.ALLO-501 and ALLO-501A are anti-CD19 products being jointly developed under a collaboration agreement between Servier and Allogene based on an exclusive license granted by Cellectis to Servier (the “Servier Agreement”). Servier grants to Allogene exclusive rights to ALLO-501 and ALLO-501A in the U.S. while Servier retains exclusive rights for all other countries. In September 2022  Servier communicated to us and Allogene that it was discontinuing its involvement in the development of in-licensed CD19 products and purporting to provide Allogene with the ability to elect to obtain a license to the CD19 products outside of the United States. We are evaluating all available options and contractual remedies to address the foregoing matters and other performance issues  which we believe may involve material breaches of the Servier Agreement by Servier. Allogene’s anti-BCMA and anti-CD70 programs are licensed exclusively from Cellectis by Allogene and Allogene holds global development and commercial rights to these programs.Servier and Allogene: anti-CD19 programsIn October 2022  Allogene announced it had initiated “the industry’s first potentially pivotal Phase 2” allogeneic CAR T clinical trial with ALLO-501A. The single-arm trial is enrolling patients with relapsed/refractory (r/r) large B cell lymphoma (LBCL) and utilizes a single dose of ALLO-501A (120 million CAR+ cells) with the FCA90 (fludarabine  30mg/m2  cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m2 and ALLO-647 30 mg  daily for 3 days) lymphodepletion regimen. The ALPHA2 trial will enroll approximately 100 patients who have received at least two prior lines of therapy and have not received prior anti-CD19 therapy. The primary endpoint of this trial is overall response rate (ORR)  and the key secondary endpoint is duration of response (DoR). Patients may receive treatment as an outpatient at the investigator’s discretion.In November 2022  Phase 1 data from the ALPHA trial with ALLO-501 and ALPHA2 trial with ALLO-501A for the treatment of r/r LBCL was presented at Allogene’s R&D Showcase. Data from the Phase 1 trials of ALLO-501 and ALLO-501A support the ability of a single administration of CAR T cells to generate deep and durable responses comparable to those with approved autologous CAR T therapies. Highlights included:As of the October 25  2022 data cutoff  the ORR and Complete Response (CR) rate was 67% and 58%  respectively  among the 12 patients treated with the Single Dose FCA90 regimen using Alloy™ process material. The median duration of response was 23.1 months.Of patients who received single dose FCA90 and were evaluable at six months  the ongoing CR rate was 50% and all CRs at six months were durable at 12 months. The longest CR ongoing at 26+ months.Phase 1 trials demonstrated a manageable safety profile with no observed dose limiting toxicities (DLTs)  graft-vs-host disease (GvHD) or severe immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS).Among patients treated with Single Dose FCA90  there was no Grade 3+ CRS. One patient (8%) experienced a Grade 3+ infection and two (17%) experienced prolonged Grade 3+ cytopenia.92% of all enrolled patients received product with 100% of infused product manufactured and released per product specifications. Patients were able to initiate treatment within two days of enrollment.Allogene has announced it is preparing for a Phase 3 study in earlier line LBCL targeting trial initiation in 1H 2024.Allogene is developing ALLO-647  its proprietary anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody intended to enable expansion and persistence of AlloCAR T product candidates  including ALLO-501A. Allogene expects that the EXPAND trial  which is intended to demonstrate the contribution of ALLO-647 to the lymphodepletion regimen  will be open to enrollment early in the second quarter.Allogene: anti-BCMA programData from the Phase 1 UNIVERSAL trial with ALLO-715 for the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (MM r/r) was also presented at Allogene’s R&D Showcase and subsequently published in Nature Medicine  accompanied by an editorial. The UNIVERSAL trial is the first allogeneic anti-BCMA CAR T to demonstrate proof-of-concept in MM with response rates that are similar to an approved autologous CAR T therapy. Allogene’s highlights include:Dose expansion cohorts demonstrated substantial and durable responses.Through a median follow-up of 14.8 months as of the October 11  2022 data cutoff  ORR was 67% in the FCA60 cohort and the very good partial response or better rate (VGPR+) was 42%. All VGPR+ were minimal residual disease (MRD) negative.The median DoR was 9.2 months  with the longest response ongoing at 24 months.92% of all enrolled patients received product with 100% of infused product manufactured and released as per product specifications. None of the patients received bridging therapy and patients were able to initiate treatment immediately following enrollment. Median time from enrollment to lymphodepletion was 5 days.Safety profile was manageable with low-grade and reversible neurotoxicity and no GvHD. Eight patients (29%) experienced Grade 3+ infections and eight patients experienced prolonged Grade 3+ cytopenias.Allogene is evaluating manufacturing processes improvements across its BCMA candidates to achieve optimal performance.Allogene: solid tumor programALLO-316  Allogene’s first AlloCAR T candidate for solid tumors  targets CD70  an antigen expressed on clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and other malignancies. At Allogene’s R&D Showcase  Allogene presented initial data demonstrating promising anti-cancer activity in the subset of nine patients with confirmed CD70-positive RCC from the ongoing Phase 1 TRAVERSE trial. Allogene’s highlights include:As of the data cutoff date of November 17  2022  the disease control rate (DCR) in patients who were CD70+ was 100% including three patients who achieved a partial response (PR) (two confirmed and one unconfirmed with the longest response lasting until month eight).Cell expansion in patients with CD70 positive tumor was robust  and there was a trend toward greater tumor shrinkage in patients with high CD70 expression.Across all patients treated in the trial  ALLO-316 has demonstrated a generally manageable safety profile with no GvHD. One dose limiting toxicity of auto-immune hepatitis occurred in the second dose level. Grade 3+ prolonged cytopenia was observed in three patients (18%). Grade 3 CRS was observed in one patient. Neurotoxicity was low grade  reversible and seen in only three patients (18%).Allogene is deploying a new investigational in vitro companion diagnostic (IVD) assay designed to prospectively assess CD70 expression levels to enhance patient selection. TRAVERSE will continue to explore varying cell dose and lymphodepletion regimens  including FC and FCA. Subject to ongoing results in the TRAVERSE trial  Allogene intends to complete planned dose exploration and initiate expansion cohort enrollment in 2023. Allogene may also investigate ALLO-316 for other CD70 expressing solid tumors and hematologic indications  or in combination with other anticancer therapies such as immune checkpoint inhibitors.Gene Editing PartnershipsIovance Biotherapeutics  Inc. (“Iovance”)On October 10  2022  Iovance announced that the first patient was dosed and completed the safety observation period in the IOV-GM1-201 clinical trial of Iovance’s first genetically modified TIL therapy in development  IOV-4001  for the treatment of previously treated advanced melanoma or metastatic NSCLC.To inactivate the gene coding for the PD-1 protein  IOV-4001 utilizes the gene-editing TALEN® technology licensed from Cellectis. This single genetic modification in IOV-4001 has the potential to enhance the antitumor activity of the TIL mechanism to directly target and kill tumor cells.Dosing the first patient with IOV-4001 is an important first step in providing proof-of-concept for delivering genetically modified TIL therapy to solid tumor patients with significant unmet needs and few treatment options.Cytovia Therapeutics  Inc. (“Cytovia”)On February 12  2021  Cellectis entered into a research collaboration and non-exclusive license agreement with Cytovia  which provided for an upfront payment or equity stake in Cytovia of $20 million (the “Upfront Payment”). On April 27  2022  in connection with Cytovia’s entry into a business combination agreement with a publicly traded Special Purpose Acquisition Company  Cellectis entered into an amendment to the license agreement and received a $20 million convertible note (the “2022 Convertible Note”)  which superseded and replaced the Upfront Payment obligation  as well as a warrant (the “SPAC Warrant”) to purchase additional shares of Cytovia following its combination with a publicly traded Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC).Cellectis and Cytovia entered into an amended and restated note  which became effective as of December 22  2022 (the “Amended and Restated 2022 Note”). The Amended and Restated 2022 Note provides for automatic conversion into Cytovia common stock in the case of certain fundamental transactions where Cytovia becomes a public company and for conversion at Cellectis’ option in connection with certain financing transactions  upon a company sale and at final maturity. In each case conversion is subject to a 9.9% ownership cap  with the balance issuable in the form of pre-funded warrants. The Amended and Restated 2022 Note increased the interest rate to 10% per annum  subject to a 10% step up upon the occurrence and continuation of an event of default  provided for the repayment of 50% of the outstanding amount on April 30  2023 and extended the final maturity date for the repayment of the remaining outstanding amount to June 30  2023. The SPAC Warrant remains outstanding  but only applies in connection with Cytovia’s business combination with a SPAC.Cellectis is developing custom TALEN®  which Cytovia uses to edit iPSCs. Cytovia is responsible for the differentiation and expansion of the gene-edited iPSC master cell bank into NK cells and is conducting the pre-clinical evaluation  clinical development  and commercialization of the mutually-agreed-upon selected therapeutic candidates. Cellectis has granted Cytovia a worldwide license under the patent rights over which Cellectis has control in this field  including in China  in order for Cytovia to modify NK cells to address multiple gene-targets for therapeutic use in several cancer indications.In November 2022  Cytovia presented preclinical data on TALEN® gene-edited  induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC)-derived Natural Killer (NK) cells at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer’s (SITC) Annual Meeting.These data highlight the progress of Cellectis’ research and development collaboration with Cytovia to develop TALEN®-edited iPSC NK and CAR-NK cells. Cellectis has developed custom TALEN® which Cytovia is using to edit iPSCs in a safe and effective manner.Primera Therapeutics  Inc. (“Primera”)On December 29  2022  Cellectis and Primera announced the execution of a Collaboration Agreement under which the companies will work collaboratively to edit mutations in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in vivo to treat the root cause of associated diseases. Primera  together with Cellectis  will be co-developing a mtDNA engineering toolbox that could enable effective therapies for mitochondrial diseases.The companies agreed to enter supplemental agreements  under which Cellectis would receive a 19% equity ownership stake in Primera and would take a seat on Primera’s Board of Directors.Pursuant to the Collaboration Agreement  Primera has a right to exercise an exclusive worldwide option for a license from Cellectis on up to five product candidates developed under the collaboration (the “partnership products”). Upon Primera exercising the option  Cellectis will be eligible for up to $750 million of development and sales milestones for the partnership products  as well as high single-digit royalty payments on the net sales of partnership products.2022 Corporate UpdatesOn December 28  2022  Cellectis entered into a €40 million credit facility with the European Investment Bank (EIB) to support its research  development and innovation activities.

Accordingly  the financial information included in this press release is preliminary and remains subject to any adjustments that may result from the completion of the audit of Cellectis’ financial statements. As a result  the financial information included in this press release may differ materially from the actual results that will be reflected in Cellectis’ audited financial statements when they are completed and publicly disclosed in Cellectis’ Annual Report on Form 20-F to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).The condensed consolidated financial statements of Cellectis  which consolidate the results of Calyxt  Inc. of which Cellectis owned approximately 49.1% of outstanding shares of common stock (as of December 31  2022)  have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards  as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IFRS”).We present certain financial metrics broken out between our two reportable segments – Therapeutics and Plants – in the appendices of this Q4 2022 financial results press release. on January 13  2023  Calyxt  Cibus Global LLC (Cibus) and certain other parties named therein  entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”)  pursuant to which  subject to the terms and conditions thereof  Calyxt and Cibus will merge in an all-stock transaction (the “Calyxt Merger”). As a consequence of the foregoing  Calyxt meets the “held-for-sale"" criteria specified in IFRS 5 and has been classified as a discontinued operation.Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Financial ResultsCash: As of December 31  2022  Cellectis  excluding Calyxt  had $95 million in consolidated cash  cash equivalents  and restricted cash. This compares to $177 million in consolidated cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash as of December 31  2021. This net decrease of $81 million primarily reflects (i) $104 million of net cash flows used in operating  investing and lease financing activities of Cellectis  and (ii) a $6 million unfavorable foreign exchange (FOREX) impact which was partially offset by (i) $6 million of cash received related to research tax credit prefinancing and (ii) $22 million of cash received related to licenses and milestone payments. Based on the current operating plan  Cellectis (excluding Calyxt) anticipates that the cash  cash equivalents  and restricted cash as of December 31  2022 will fund Cellectis’ operations into third of 2024.Revenues and Other Income: Consolidated revenues and other income were $25.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31  2022 compared to $38.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31  2021. This $12.9 million decrease between the twelve months ended December 31  2022 and 2021 was mainly attributable to (i) a decrease of revenue pursuant to the recognition of a $20 million convertible note obtained as consideration for a “right-to-use” license granted to Cytovia and the $10 million Allogene milestones during the twelve-month period ended December 31  2021  while revenue related to collaboration agreements for the twelve months of 2022 consists of the recognition of one milestone with Servier of $15.8 million  two upfront payments related to Cellectis’ agreement with Cytovia for $1.5 million and the recognition of $1 million related to a change of control of a licensee pursuant to the terms of its license agreement with Cellectis  and (ii) a decrease of $1.7 million of research credit tax due to a decrease of R&D expenses.R&D Expenses: Consolidated R&D expenses were $97.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31  2022 compared to $117.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31  2021. The $20.3 million decrease between the twelve months of 2022 and 2021 was primarily attributable to (i) a decrease of purchases  external expenses and other by $13.7 million (from $68.6 million in 2021 to $54.9 million in 2022) due to lower consumables  subcontracting costs and depreciation and amortization (ii) a $5.3 million decrease in non-cash stock-based compensation expense  (iii) a $0.9 million decrease in social charges on stock option  and (iv) a $0.4 million decrease in wages and social charges related to R&D headcount.SG&A Expenses: Consolidated SG&A expenses were $17.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31  2022 compared to $22.9 million for the twelve months ended December 31  2021. The $5.4 million decrease primarily reflects (i) a $3.3 million decrease in purchases  external expenses and other (from $13.1 million in 2021 to $9.8 million in 2022)  (ii) a $2.1 million decrease in personal expenses.Net income (loss) from discontinued operations: The $13.0 million decrease of net income loss from discontinued operations is primarily driven by (i) the decrease of $29.5 million of cost of revenue  (ii) the decrease of $4.4 million of R&D expenses (from $11.2 million in 2021 to $11.4 in 2022) and SG&A expenses (from $15 million in 2021 to $10.4 million in 2022) and (iii) the increase of $7.9 million of net financial gain partially offset by the $28.3 million decrease of revenue and other income.Net Income (loss) Attributable to Shareholders of Cellectis: The consolidated net loss attributable to shareholders of Cellectis was $106.1 million (or $2.33 per share) for the twelve months ended December 31  2022  of which $98.7 million was attributed to Cellectis continuing operations  compared to $114.2 million (or $2.55 per share) for the twelve months ended December 31  2021  of which $96.7 million was attributed to Cellectis continuing operations. This $8.1 million decrease in net loss between the twelve months of 2022 and 2021 was primarily driven by (i) a $20.4 million decrease of research and development  (ii) a decrease of 13.0 million of loss from discontinued operations (from $28.4 million in 2021 to $15.3 million in 2022) and (iii) a $5.4 million decrease of SG&A expenses partially offset by (i) an increase in net financial loss of $15.7 million primarily due to the decrease of the fair value of Cytovia’s convertible note on December 31  2022 of $7.9 million compared to a $20 million receivables on December 31  2021  (ii) a decrease of $12.9 million of revenues and other income and (iii) a decrease of $3 million in loss attributable to non-controlling interests due to the decrease in Calyxt’s net loss partially offset by the reduction of Cellectis’ ownership in Calyxt.Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Shareholders of Cellectis: The consolidated adjusted net loss attributable to shareholders of Cellectis was $98.1 million (or $2.15 per share) for the twelve months ended December 31  2022  of which $92.6 million is attributed to Cellectis  compared to a net loss of $101.7 million (or $2.27 per share) for the twelve months ended December 31  2021  of which $85.3 million was attributed to Cellectis.Please see ""Note Regarding Use of Non-IFRS Financial Measures"" for reconciliation of GAAP net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis to adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis.We currently foresee focusing our cash spending at Cellectis for 2023 in the following areas:Supporting the development of our pipeline of product candidates  including the manufacturing and clinical trial expenses of UCART123  UCART22  UCARTCS1  UCART 20x22 and potential new product candidates  andOperating our state-of-the-art manufacturing capabilities in Paris (France)  and Raleigh (North Carolina  USA); andContinuing strengthening our manufacturing and clinical departments.CELLECTIS S.A.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION($ in thousands  except per share data)As of December 31  2021 December 31  2022 (2) ASSETS Non-current assets Intangible assets 1 854 718 Property  plant  and equipment 78 846 63 621 Right-of-use assets 69 423 44 275 Non-current financial assets 6 524 8 791 Total non-current assets 156 647 117 406 Current assets Inventories - - Trade receivables 20 361 772 Subsidies receivables 9 268 14 496 Other current assets 9 665 9 078 Cash and cash equivalent and Current financial assets 186 135 97 697 Total current assets 225 429 122 043 Total assets held for sale 21 768 TOTAL ASSETS 382 076 261 216 LIABILITIES Shareholders’ equity Share capital 2 945 2 955 Premiums related to the share capital 934 696 583 122 Currency translation adjustment (18 021 ) (28 605 ) Retained earnings (584 129 ) (333 365 ) Net income (loss) (114 197 ) (106 139 ) Total shareholders’ equity - Group Share 221 293 117 968 Non-controlling interests 15 181 7 973 Total shareholders’ equity 236 474 125 941 Non-current liabilities Non-current financial liabilities 20 030 20 531 Non-current lease debts 71 526 49 358 Non-current provisions 4 073 2 390 Other non-current liabilities 626 0 Total non-current liabilities 96 254 72 279 Current liabilities Current financial liabilities 2 354 5 088 Current lease debts 8 329 7 872 Trade payables 23 762 21 456 Deferred revenues and deferred income 301 59 Current provisions 871 477 Other current liabilities 13 731 13 179 Total current liabilities 49 348 48 131 Total liabilities related to asset held for sale 14 864 TOTAL LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY 382 076 261 2162.

Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis is not a measure calculated in accordance with IFRS. We have included in this press release a reconciliation of this figure to net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis  which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with IFRS. Because adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis excludes Non-cash stock-based compensation expense—a non-cash expense  we believe that this financial measure  when considered together with our IFRS financial statements  can enhance an overall understanding of Cellectis’ financial performance. Moreover  our management views the Company’s operations  and manages its business  based  in part  on this financial measure. In particular  we believe that the elimination of Non-cash stock-based expenses from Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core businesses. Our use of adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis has limitations as an analytical tool  and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under IFRS. Some of these limitations are: (a) other companies  including companies in our industry which use similar stock-based compensation  may address the impact of Non-cash stock- based compensation expense differently; and (b) other companies may report adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders or similarly titled measures but calculate them differently  which reduces their usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these and other limitations  you should consider adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis alongside our IFRS financial results  including Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis.RECONCILIATION OF IFRS TO NON-IFRS NET INCOME – Fourth Quarter(unaudited)($ in thousands  except per share data)For the three-month periods ended December 31  2022 2021 (1) 2022 (2) Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis (24 996 ) (26 815 ) Adjustment: Non-cash stock-based compensation expense attributable to shareholders of Cellectis 3 557 859 Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis (21 439 ) (25 956 ) Basic Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($/share) (0.47 ) (0.57 ) Basic adjusted earnings from discontinued operations attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($ /share) (0.07 ) (0.01 ) Weighted average number of outstanding shares  basic (units) (1) 45 481 310 45 653 279 Diluted Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($/share) (1) (0.47 ) (0.57 ) Diluted Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($/share) from discontinued operations (0.07 ) (0.01 ) Weighted average number of outstanding shares  diluted (units) (1) 45 481 310 45 653 2791.

Revenue in the full year 2022 was $50.7 million compared with $79.8 million in the same period last year. The change from prior year for both periods reflects a decline in shipments of liquid cooling products due to the continued challenging business climate.Gross margin was 41% for the fourth quarter of 2022 compared with 42% in the same period of 2021. The margin in the fourth quarter of 2022 reflects a change in the product mix partly offset by a stronger U.S. dollar  when compared with the same period of prior year. Gross margin for the full year 2022 was 41% compared with 42% in 2021.""While the general business climate remains challenging  we are seeing signs of our markets stabilizing with increased activity from our liquid cooling customers. This is reflected in a strong pipeline of planned new product releases going into the year. We recently started shipping our innovative wheelbases and steering wheels with very strong feedback from end-users in the racing community. This confirms the compelling value proposition we bring to gamers and enthusiasts  and with a reduced cost base and an agile organization  we are well positioned to capture the long-term growth potential as our markets normalize "" said André Sloth Eriksen the CEO of Asetek.Operating loss was $1.9 million and adjusted EBITDA was negative $0.6 million in the quarter  compared with operating loss of $0.6 million and adjusted EBITDA of positive $0.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. For the full year  operating loss was $5.4 million and adjusted EBITDA was negative $0.8 million  compared with operating income of $0.8 million and adjusted EBITDA of $7.2 million in 2021.Operating expenses of $5.8 million were 28% lower than the fourth quarter of 2021. The cost savings were principally due to reduced staffing costs associated with headcount reductions  reduced litigation and a stronger U.S. dollar which had a favorable effect of approximately $0.8 million. Depreciation and amortization amounted to $1.1 million and share based compensation was $150 thousand. Full-year operating expenses were $26.2 million  20% lower than for2021.During 2022  the Company invested $22.2 million in property and equipment  including development of a new headquarters facility  and $3.4 million in capitalized costs for the development of new products. The Company drew $18.6 million on a construction credit line during the year. During the fourth quarter  the Company expanded the total credit line available from its main bank to DKK 205 million (USD 29.3 million).As of December 31  2022  the Company had working capital of negative $6.3 million and non-current liabilities of $1.7 million.The Company believes that its cash position and the liquidity available from its operations  external borrowings and other sources currently available to it is sufficient to satisfy its working capital requirements until around mid-May 2023. From then on  the Company expects a cash shortfall mainly as a result of cash balances (including cash inflows from operations) being allocated to capital expenditures related to the construction of a new headquarters facility. On that basis  the Company's primary provider of credit bank has requested an equity capital injection in order to continue the credit facilities  which are necessary for the company to service its payment obligations. As a result  the Company plans to raise gross proceeds of approximately DKK 140 million (USD 20 million)  with expected net proceeds of DKK 115 million (USD 16 million)  in a fully underwritten rights issue.The equity offering is expected to be launched in April 2023 and the net proceeds are expected to be available on or around May 15  2023. In addition  Management has discussed short-term debt financing with a bank to secure financing if a shortfall occurs before the funding is received from the planned equity offering. The bank has indicated willingness to provide bridge financing for the shortfall period. The fully underwritten rights issue is subject to certain customary conditions  including finalization of the committed loan agreement and approval of the rights issue at an extraordinary general meeting of Asetek.The Company's shares have been admitted to trading and official listing on Oslo Børs since 2013. The Board of Directors of Asetek believes that it is now an appropriate time to broaden the shareholder base. In connection with the Rights Issue  the Company therefore intends to apply for a temporary dual listing of the shares on Nasdaq Copenhagen A/S. The dual listing will be temporary as the Company intends to explore the option of delisting from Oslo Børs  which will  among other things  be subject to approval by Oslo Børs and the Company's general meeting.At December 31  2022  total assets were $78.6 million ($75.4 million at December 31  2021) and total equity was $42.7 million ($48.4 million). The main factors affecting the change in assets were net additions to property  plant and equipment of $19.4 million  partly offset by decreases in trade receivables of $6.5 million associated with lower sales volume. The Company also utilized $15.9 million of cash and equivalents for funding construction of the headquarters facility  the operating loss and investment in the new SimSports business.OPERATIONSIn the fourth quarter  the Company announced its 8th generation and most advanced liquid cooling technology to date  made first available in the ASUS ROG RYUO III ARGB Series CPU coolers. Asetek also announced that its technology is powering EVGA's highest-performing CPU cooler series to date  the EVGA CLX.Six new products began shipping in the fourth quarter  all liquid coolers  two of which feature the Company's new 8th generation technology. In the first quarter  twenty-four new liquid cooling products and eight new SimSports products are expected to begin shipping. In the fourth quarter  Asetek shipped 157 thousand sealed loop coolers compared with 302 thousand in the fourth quarter of 2021.The Company unveiled several new SimSports products including Invicta™ and Forte™ direct drive wheelbases  Forte Formula steering wheels  and product bundles which include racing pedals  wheelbase and steering wheel. These new offerings  available for shipment in the first quarter of 2023  bring full immersion to sim racing for all levels of gamers. The current order backlog for SimSports products is in the range of $2 to $3 million. To expedite SimSports product deliveries to consumers and resellers in North America  Asetek established a U.S.-based hub during the fourth quarter.OUTLOOKHigh inflation  rising interest rates and geo-political tensions continue to impact into 2023. At the same time  there are early signs of market stabilization as the impact of pandemic lockdowns and supply chain disturbances start to ease. Discretionary consumer spending remains subdued  but the Company is experiencing increased demand for the Liquid cooling and SimSports products for gamers and enthusiasts  reflected also in the forecasts provided by OEM customers. However  visibility is low in the current environment  and the Company maintains its focus on cost efficiencies and product development.Considering a continued volatile global situation  revenue growth for 2023 is expected to be nearly back to normal for the Company  in the range of 5% to 15% compared with 2022. This outlook considers the possibility of further supply chain disruptions  continued general geo-political tensions  no Data center revenue ($4 million for full-year 2022)  as well as an overall expectation that the business climate will normalize over the course of the year. Operating income is projected to be between $2 and $4 million in 2023.Annual ReportThe 2022 Annual Report will be released separately later today pending finalization of the ESEF tagging audit.Conference call and webcastCEO André Sloth Eriksen and CFO Peter Dam Madsen will present the Company's results today at 8:30 AM CET and invites investors  analysts and media to join the presentation.

Taking a year-over ...,Euronext FX volume remains in growth modePan-European exchange  Euronext has reported a five percent increase in the average daily volume on its spot foreign exchange market. The ADV figure stood at $20.61 billion in February 2023  which is up from January’s $19.64 billion.Taking a year-over-year perspective  Euronext’s currency turnover was down 18 percent from $25 billion reported back in February 2022.In terms of its aggregated monthly turnover  Euronext FX reported $412 billion  which is down 4.6 percent from $432 billion that changed hands in the previous month.Euronext  which operates stock and derivatives markets in countries such as France  the Netherlands and Belgium  also said its total derivatives trading was down by 4 percent. The figure was reported at 13.22 million contracts a day in February compared to 13.75 million in December. It was also down -20 percent when weighed against 2022’s turnover of 16.58 million contacts.Euronext confirmed the attractiveness of its primary markets activity in 2022  remaining the leading venue for equity listing in Europe and debt listing worldwide. The company operates listing venues in Amsterdam  Brussels  Dublin  Lisbon  Oslo  Milan and Paris  and is home to 1 900+ equity issuers  worth €6.4 trillion in aggregated market capitalization.

Additionally  25% of the shares traded in Europe are traded on Euronext markets.Full year 2022’s underlying revenue came in at €1.46 billion  up 9.3 percent from €1.14 billion the previous year  illustrating the strong performance of non-volume related business and enhanced revenue capture.The exchange operator attributed the results to stable performance in listing and post-trade businesses  as well as the contribution of the Borsa Italiana.Trading revenue in 2022 was higher by 10 percent on a yearly basis at €541 million  primarily driven by strong performance of FX and power trading volumes. The softer cash trading volumes from the second semester of 2022 were offset by yield management and an uptick in market share from October 2022.Meanwhile  post-trade revenue grew 13.7 percent to €364.5 million thanks to the strong performance of the clearing activities of its Italian units and Euronext’s diversified business model.
