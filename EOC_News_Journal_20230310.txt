The Program is directed to the Group Executive Committee and a number of senior executives and key employees within SSAB and is intended to be implemented after SSAB's Annual General Meeting 2023.The Annual General Meeting 2022 resolved on a long-term cash-based incentive program for key employees within SSAB  including the Group Executive Committee (""LTI 2022""). In order to promote a common interest for the company management and shareholders of long-term good return  the Board of Directors considers that the program is appropriately designed and proposes that the Annual General Meeting 2023 adopt a long-term cash-based incentive program with substantially the same conditions as the LTI 2022  with the modification that a performance condition regarding sustainability be added. The Board of Directors also considers that such a program would promote the Company's ability to recruit and retain key employees.The Board of Directors has further resolved on a policy for senior executives' shareholdings  in order for members in the Group Executive Committee to accumulate over time a shareholding in SSAB corresponding to a gross annual base salary and other participants in LTI 2023 a shareholding corresponding to half a gross annual base salary. The Board of Directors' intention is for the participants to use the cash remuneration after tax received under LTI 2023 to acquire shares in SSAB in order to accumulate such shareholding. The policy does not apply to participants employed in North America  for whom the payment of cash remuneration under LTI 2023 instead will be deferred by 12 months.Principal terms and conditions of the ProgramThe Board of Directors proposes that the Program shall be based on the following principal terms and conditions.(a)The Program is proposed to be open to no more than 160 senior executives  including the Company's President  and identified key employees of SSAB.(b)The Company intends to offer senior executives and identified key employees to participate in the Program during the second quarter of 2023  with the opportunity for the participants to accept the offer no later than 30 June 2023 (however with the right for the Board of Directors to postpone the acceptance date for individual participants where there are special reasons).(c)The participants have the opportunity  depending on satisfaction of certain long-term performance conditions (as defined in paragraph d) below) to obtain a cash remuneration free of charge (the ""Cash Remuneration"") after the end of a three-year vesting period (the ""Vesting Period""). Cash Remuneration for each participant may not exceed; for the President 40 per cent  for other members of the Group Executive Committee outside North America 35 per cent  for members of the Group Executive Committee in North America 108 per cent  for identified key employees outside North America 20-30 per cent and for identified key employees in North America 24-108 per cent of the participant's fixed annual cash salary (gross) as of 1 January 2023.(d)Payment of Cash Remuneration shall depend on the degree of fulfilment of the following performance conditions for the Program:(i)A Program specific financial target consisting of the total return on the Company's shares (TSR) for the financial years 2023  2024 and 2025 in relation to a reference value that to 70 per cent consists of the average total shareholder return of a benchmark group of other companies[1] and to 30 per cent of the OMXS30 index (the ""Reference Value"") (the ""TSR Condition"").Payment of Cash Remuneration related to the TSR Condition shall be calculated in accordance with the following:A condition for any Cash Remuneration related to the TSR Condition to be paid is that the Company's TSR during the Vesting Period has provided a better return compared to the Reference Value  i.e. an overperformance exceeding 0 per cent (the ""TSR Minimum Level""). If the TSR Minimum Level is not reached  no Cash Remuneration related to the TSR Condition will be paid.For maximum payment of Cash Remuneration related to the TSR Condition  the Company's TSR during the Vesting Period shall have overperformed the Reference Value by at least 10 per cent (""TSR Maximum Level"").If the Company's TSR is between the TSR Minimum Level and the TSR Maximum Level  the participants will receive a linear Cash Remuneration in proportion to the TSR outcome.(ii)A Program specific non-financial target regarding sustainability (the ""Sustainability Condition"").Payment of Cash Remuneration related to the Sustainability Condition shall be calculated in accordance with the following:A condition for any Cash Remuneration related to the Sustainability Condition to be paid is that the outcome of the Sustainability Condition during the Vesting Period exceeds a certain minimum level (the ""Sustainability Minimum Level""). If the Sustainability Minimum Level is not reached  no Cash Remuneration related to the Sustainability Condition will be paid.For maximum payment of Cash Remuneration related to the Sustainability Condition  the outcome of the Sustainability Condition during the Vesting Period shall exceed a certain maximum level (""Sustainability Maximum Level"").Should the outcome of the Sustainability Condition be between the Sustainability Minimum Level and the Sustainability Maximum Level  the participants will receive a linear Cash Remuneration in proportion to the outcome.(iii)The TSR Condition will be weighted 90 per cent and the Sustainability Condition 10 per cent  when payment of the Cash Remuneration is decided. In connection with the expiration of the Vesting Period  the Board of Directors will publish information disclosing to what extent the TSR Condition and Sustainability Condition were fulfilled.(e)Cash Remuneration may normally be paid only after the expiration of the Vesting Period (and for participants in North America  payment shall normally be made by a twelve-month deferral).(f)A prerequisite for a participant  where applicable  to be able to receive Cash Remuneration  is that he/she  with certain exemptions approved by the Board of Directors  has been permanently employed within the SSAB Group for the duration of the whole Vesting Period.(g)If extraordinary changes in the SSAB Group or in the market occur which  in the opinion of the Board of Directors  would result in a situation where the conditions for Cash Remuneration under the Program become unreasonable  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to make adjustments to the Program  including  among other things  be entitled to resolve on a reduced right to Cash Remuneration  or that no Cash Remuneration shall be paid at all.(h)The Board of Directors shall be authorised to establish the detailed terms and conditions for the Program. The Board of Directors may  in that regard  make necessary adjustments of these general terms and conditions to satisfy certain regulations or market conditions outside Sweden.(i)Participation in the Program presupposes that such participation is legally possible in the various jurisdictions concerned.Costs for the Program  dilution  etc.The annual cost[2] for LTI 2023 including social security charges is estimated to a maximum of SEK 80 million if the fulfilment of each of the performance conditions is 50 per cent (a maximum of SEK 160 million if the fulfilment of each of the performance conditions is 100 per cent). This cost can be related to SSAB's total cost for salaries and remuneration including social security charges of SEK 12 092 million in 2022. The effects on key ratios and profit per share are marginal.The Program is cash-based and does not entail any dilution for the Company's shareholders. No hedging arrangements are intended to be made with regard to the Program's financial exposure.Preparations of the proposalThe proposed Program has  pursuant to the guidelines issued by SSAB's Board of Directors  been prepared by SSAB's Remuneration Committee with the assistance of external advisors. The Remuneration Committee has informed the Board of Directors of its work  whereafter the Board of Directors has resolved that the Program shall be referred to the Annual General Meeting 2023 for approval.Majority requirementsThe Annual General Meeting's resolution on approval of the Program requires simple majority of the votes cast.Previous incentive programs in SSABSSAB has resolved on long-term cash-based incentive programs since 2011. The Company's other incentive programs are described in more detail in note B.4 in SSAB's annual report for the financial year 2022.15. Resolution on authorization for the Board of Directors to resolve on acquisitions of own sharesThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorize the Board of Directors to resolve on acquisitions of own shares on the following terms and conditions:Acquisitions may be made of shares of series A and/or B.Acquisitions may take place Nasdaq Stockholm and/or Nasdaq Helsinki.The authorization may be utilized on one or several occasions during the period up to the next Annual General Meeting.Acquisitions may be made of such amount of shares of series A and/or B that the holding of the Company at any time does not exceed 10 per cent of the total number of shares in the Company.Acquisitions may only be made at a price per share within the price range between the highest purchase price and lowest selling price applicable from time to time on Nasdaq Stockholm or Nasdaq Helsinki.The purpose of the authorization is to give the Board of Directors increased freedom of action to adjust the Company's capital structure so as to create greater value for the Company's shareholders  after which the Board of Directors intends to propose to the Annual General Meeting 2024 that it resolves to cancel the shares repurchased by the Company. In addition  the Board of Directors intends to also propose to the same Annual General Meeting a resolution concerning an equivalent bonus issue to restore the decreased share capital.The Board of Directors has issued a statement in accordance with Chapter 19  Section 22 of the Swedish Companies Act.In order to be valid  a resolution under this item requires the approval of at least two thirds of the votes cast and the shares represented at the meeting.Information at the Annual General MeetingThe shareholders are entitled to some information at the Annual General Meeting.

Provided that the AGM votes in favor of this proposal  the dividend is expected to be sent out via Euroclear on Monday  April 24  2023.Long-term share savings programBackgroundSince 2012 the AGMs have resolved on the implementation of long-term share saving programs for employees of the company. The terms of the share savings program (the “Program”) now proposed by the Board of Directors to the 2023 AGM corresponds to the program adopted by the 2022 AGM. Industrivärden’s long-term share savings programs that are outstanding and were completed during the year are presented in more detail in Note 8 of the Annual Report 2022.The Program entails that the employee after three years receives so-called performance shares  provided that certain conditions are fulfilled and that the employee has invested a portion of his or her base salary in Industrivärden shares and that the employee has not given  or been served  notice of termination during the Lock-in Period (as defined in item d below).The purpose of the Program is to encourage Industrivärden’s employees to increase their shareholdings and thereby further emphasize long-term shareholder value. The share savings program is deemed to increase Industrivärden’s prospects for retaining and recruiting competent employees as well as the employees’ interest and involvement in Industrivärden’s business and development. The performance conditions  which are based on the total return for Industrivärden shares during the term of the Program  are deemed to further enhance the participants’ long-term commitment and the mutual interests between Industrivärden’s shareholders and employees. The Program is intended to be annually recurring and constitute the form of long-term variable remuneration.The Board of Directors thus proposes that the 2023 AGM resolve to implement a long-term share savings program for in total no more than 20 employees of Industrivärden.The Board of Directors’ proposal for resolutionThe Board of Directors proposes that the AGM resolve to implement the Program based on the terms and conditions set out below.a. The Program is open to the CEO and a maximum of 4 other members of Industrivärden’s management (“CEO” and “Management” respectively)  to a maximum of 6 key persons employed by Industrivärden (“Key Persons”)  and to other permanent employees of Industrivärden (“Employees”)  however in total a maximum of 20 permanent employees of Industrivärden.b. Provided that the CEO  Management  Key Persons and Employees (as applicable) have made an own investment in Class C shares in Industrivärden (“Savings Shares”) during the Acquisition Period (defined in item c below)  such participant is under the terms of the Program offered the opportunity to be granted shares free of charge  from a designated third party at the end of the Lock-in Period  as follows:(i) Provided that the total return for the Industrivärden Class C shares during the Lock-in Period is equal to or exceeds 10 percent  all program participants may be granted 0.5 Class C shares in Industrivärden (“Performance Share”) per Savings Share (ii) Provided that the average annual total return for Industrivärden Class C shares during the Lock-in Period is equal to or exceeds SIXRX during the same period of time  the CEO and Management may be granted 1 additional Performance Share  Key Persons may be granted 0.5 additional Performance Share  and Employees may be granted 0.5 additional Performance Share  per Savings Share (iii) Provided that the average annual total return for Industrivärden Class C shares during the Lock-in Period exceeds SIXRX by 2 percentage points during the same period of time  the CEO and Management may be granted 1.5 additional Performance Shares and Key Persons may be granted 1 additional Performance Share per Savings Share  and(iv) Provided that the average annual total return for Industrivärden Class C shares during the Lock-in Period exceeds SIXRX by 3 percentage points during the same period of time  the CEO may be granted 1 additional Performance Share per Savings share.In total  the Program thus entails that the CEO may be granted 4 Performance Shares per Savings Share  that Management may be granted 3 Performance Shares per Savings Share  that Key Persons may be granted 2 Performance Shares per Savings Share  and that Employees may be granted 1 Performance Share per Savings Share.c. The maximum number of Savings Shares that each program participant may acquire is limited in such way that Savings Shares may be acquired for an amount corresponding to a maximum of 10 percent of the participant’s gross annual base salary for 2023. Acquisition of Savings Shares shall take place during the period from 21 July 2023 until and including 31 October 2023  however with a right for the Board of Directors to extend the period in certain circumstances (the “Acquisition Period”).d. Grants of Performance Shares are expected to take place shortly after publication of Industrivärden’s third quarter interim report for 2026. The time from the last day of the Acquisition Period to the date of publication of Industrivärden’s third quarter interim report for 2026 is defined as the “Lock-in Period”.e. In order for a program participant to be granted Performance Shares it is required that  with certain specific exemptions  the participant has not given  or been served  notice of termination of employment in Industrivärden during the Lock-in Period and that the participant  throughout the Lock-in Period  has retained the Savings Shares. Saving Shares disposed of prior to the expiration of the Lock-in Period will therefore not entitle to any grants of Performance Shares. Should a program participant retire during the Lock-in Period  the entitlement to receive allotment of Performance Shares shall be reduced in proportion to the time remaining in the Lock-in Period.f. The Program shall comprise a maximum of 50 000 Class C shares in Industrivärden. Should Savings Shares be acquired at a share price such that the total number of Performance Shares exceeds 50 000  the number of Performance Shares that may be transferred to the program participants will be proportionally reduced.g. The Board of Directors shall be authorized to establish the detailed terms and conditions for the Program.h. In the event significant changes occur in Industrivärden or the market  or in the event the costs for the Program significantly exceed the estimated costs  and this  in the opinion of the Board of Directors  results in a situation where the conditions for grants of Performance Shares under the Program become unreasonable  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to make adjustments to the Program  including  among other things  a decision to reduce the grant of Performance Shares or to not grant any Performance Shares at all.i. The number of Performance Shares shall be subject to recalculation as a result of intervening bonus issues  splits  rights issues and/or other similar company events.Drafting of the proposalThe proposal regarding the Program to the 2023 AGM has been decided on by the Board of Directors following preparation by the Compensation Committee.Hedging  etc.To hedge the financial exposure that the Program is expected to have  the Board of Directors intends to enter into a share swap agreement with a third party on behalf of Industrivärden  at market terms  whereby the third party in its own name shall be entitled to acquire and transfer Class C shares in Industrivärden to the program participants.As proposed the Program may comprise a maximum of 50 000 Class C shares in Industrivärden  representing approximately 0.01 percent of all outstanding shares in Industrivärden and approximately 0.03 percent of all outstanding Class C shares in Industrivärden.In accordance with the scope of the Program as described above  the cost upon full grant is estimated to approximately SEK 13 million  under the assumption all employees participate in the Program and that all program participants acquire the maximum number of Savings Shares.The Program is expected to have only marginal effect on Industrivärden’s and the Industrivärden Group’s key ratios.Majority requirementsThe AGM’s resolution in accordance with the above requires a majority of more than half of the votes cast.Nominating Committee’s proposalsThe Nominating Committee has consisted of Bo Damberg (Jan Wallanders and Tom Hedelius Foundation and others)  Mats Guldbrand (L E Lundbergföretagen)  Fredrik Lundberg (Chairman of the Board of AB Industrivärden)  Mikael Schmidt (Essity Pension Foundations and others)  and Jan Svedjebrant (SCA Pension Foundations and others).

Maximum 2 340 943 shares  corresponding to approximately 5 per cent of the company’s share capital  may be issued. An issue may be made with or without deviation from the shareholders’ preferential right. An issue may be made against cash payment  by set-off or by contribution in kind. The subscription price shall  at deviation from the shareholders’ preferential right  be determined in accordance with market practice. The Board of Directors shall be entitled to determine other terms of the issue.The purpose of the authorisation  and the reason for the deviation from the shareholders’ preferential right  is to enable the company to finance or carry out  in whole or in part  company acquisitions with the company’s own shares. There have been requests from sellers of companies to receive shares in HMS Networks as payment in conjunction with acquisitions and in case of acquisitions of smaller entrepreneurial companies it might work as an important incentive for the seller to receive shares in HMS Networks.Under the Swedish Companies Act  the resolution of the General Meeting on authorisation for the Board of Directors to resolve on new share issues requires the support of shareholders representing at least two-thirds of both the number of votes cast and the shares represented at the Meeting in order to be valid.Resolution on the Board of Directors’ proposal on (a) implementation of a performance-based Share Saving Plan 2024-2027 for all employees  (b) authorisation of the Board of Directors to resolve on repurchase of own shares within Share Saving Plan 2024-2027 and (c) transfer of own shares to participants in Share Saving Plan 2024-2027 (item 16)A. Implementation of performance-based Share Saving Plan 2024-2027 for all employeesThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves on implementation of the below described Share Saving Plan 2024-2027 to all employees  comprising a maximum of 70 000 shares in the company  according to the following principal conditions:All permanent employees within the group as per 31 December 2023 (approximately 830 persons) will be offered to participate in the program. In order to participate in the program  the participant must  with own funds  make an investment of minimum 1% and maximum between 3% and 6% (depending on position  se item 2 below) of his or her annual fixed gross salary in shares in the company at market price over Nasdaq Stockholm (“Saving Shares”). Notification of participation in Share Saving Program 2024-2027 shall be made no later than 31 December 2023. The investment shall take place during 2024 and shall be made to an amount corresponding to minimum 1% of the gross salary for 2023  with the possibility to further investment up to the fixed maximum amount. For senior executives (approximately 100 persons)  it is required that the own investment amounts to a minimum of 1% and a maximum of 6% of the gross salary for 2023. For other employees (approximately 730 persons)  it is required that the own investment amounts to a minimum of 1% and maximum of 3% of the gross salary for 2023. Each Saving Share entitles the participant to receive free of charge a maximum of two (2) shares in the company  based on the achievement of certain performance conditions (“Performance Share”). The performance conditions are based on the development of earnings per share according to determined objectives by the Board of Directors during the financial years 2025-2027 (the “Measurement Period”). The performance condition that has to be achieved of exceeded relates to average annual growth of the company’s earnings per share during the Measurement Period  whereby Performance Shares is received linearly between the interval 0-20% and an average annual growth during the Measurement Period of 20% corresponds to maximum allotment  i.e. two (2) Performance Shares. Through the connection to earnings per share throughout the measurement period  the performance conditions contribute to the company’s long-term value creation. Upon achievement of the performance conditions  Performance Shares will be received within 60 days after the day of the publishing of the year-end report regarding the financial year 2027. Subject to customary exceptions  the participant does not receive Performance Shares if the participant does not acquire Saving Shares according to determined minimum level  does not hold all of his or her Saving Shares up to and including 31 December 2027  or does not remain in his or her employment or equivalent within the group as per this date. A small number of selected consultants with assignments of essential importance for the company should be offered to  on comparable terms and conditions  participate in Share Saving Plan 2024-2027. The Board of Directors shall be responsible for the detailed terms and conditions of Share Saving Plan 2024-2027 within the scope the above stated principal terms and conditions  as well as such reasonable adjustments of the program which are deemed appropriate or efficient due to legal or administrative conditions. In addition  the Board of Directors shall have the right to make minor adjustments to the terms and conditions and the administration of the share saving plan  in order to comply with local rules  market practice and administrative circumstances  in a cost-effective manner in some of the group's jurisdictions other than Sweden.B. Authorisation for the Board of Directors to resolve on repurchase of own shares within Share Saving Plan 2024-2027To enable the company’s delivery of Performance Shares according to Share Saving Plan 2024-2027  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to authorise the Board of Directors to resolve on repurchase of own shares in accordance with the following conditions:The repurchase of shares shall take place on Nasdaq Stockholm. The authorisation may be exercised on one or several occasions until the Annual General Meeting 2024. The repurchase shall as a maximum comprise the number of shares required for delivery of Matching and Performance Shares to the participants in Share Saving Plan 2024-2027  however no more than 70 000 shares.Repurchase shall be made at a price within the share price interval registered from time to time  where share price interval means the difference between the highest buying price and the lowest selling price.Payment of the repurchased shares shall be made in cash. The Board of Directors shall have the right to resolve on other terms and conditions for the repurchase.The repurchase is expected to take place on one or several occasions in conjunction with the notification and investment periods during 2023 and 2024. To the extent that repurchase must be made after the Annual General Meeting 2024 in order to ensure delivery of shares according to the program’s maximum amount  a new authorisation for repurchase of shares is required by the next Annual General Meeting.C. Transfer of own shares to participants in the Share Saving Plan 2024-2027To be able to deliver Performance Shares under Share Saving Plan 2024-2027  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves on transfer of own shares in accordance with the following conditions:A maximum number of 70 000 shares may be transferred free of charge to participants in Share Saving Plan 2024-2027. With deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights  the right to acquire shares free of charge shall comprise persons within the group participating in Share Saving Plan 2024-2027  with a right for each of the participant to acquire the maximum number of shares stipulated in the terms and conditions of the Share Saving Plan 2024-2027. Transfer of shares shall be made free of charge at the time for  and according to the terms for  the allotment of shares to participants in Share Saving Plan 2024-2027. The number of shares that may be transferred under Share Saving Plan 2024-2027 may be recalculated due to any intervening split or reverse share split  bonus issue  preferential issue and/or similar corporate actions.The reason for deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights is to enable the company to transfer Performance Shares to the participants in Share Saving Plan 2024-2027.Shares that have been acquired by the company  and which are not transferred to participants in the Share Saving Plan 2024-2027 may be transferred to participants in previous share saving plans or future share saving plans decided on by the General Meeting of the company. Also such shares acquired by the company within previous years' share saving plans may be transferred to participants in the Share Saving Plan 2024-2027  previous share saving plans or future share saving plans decided on by the General Meeting. Transfer shall take place in accordance with applicable rules for the current share saving plan.Estimated costsThe program will generate costs related to the application of IFRS 2 “Share-related remuneration” amounting to approximately MSEK 26 and costs for social security contributions of approximately MSEK 9 for the shares which are allotted free of charge. The total effect on the income statement is estimated to amount to approximately MSEK 35  distributed over the years 2024-2027.Costs according to IFRS 2 do not affect the cash flow or equity during the duration of the Share Saving Plan. The acquisition cost of the shares is estimated to approximately MSEK 26 and will affect the cash flow and equity in connection with acquisition of the shares. The social security contributions effect the equity continuously  but the cash flow only in 2028  after that the shares has been allotted. Administrative costs for the program are estimated to amount to MSEK 0.8 during the duration of the program.The above cost-estimate is based on assumptions that just over half of the employees participate in the program  that all participants remain until the end of the program  an investment level per participant based on historical outcome and a maximum outcome on the performance conditions corresponding to two (2) Performance Shares per Saving Share. For the share price at the end of the program  a development corresponding to the outcome of the performance condition earnings per share has been assumed.Reason for the proposalThe Board of Directors’ reason for the abovementioned proposal on Share Saving Plan 2024-2027 is that a personal long-term owner commitment in the company by the employees is expected to stimulate an increased interest for the company’s operation and earnings  and to increase the motivation and affinity with the company. The offering and participation in the Share Saving Plan shall be considered as a part of the total remuneration package. Therefore  the Board of Directors assesses that the Share Saving Plan is favourably for both the company and its shareholders. It is the Board of Directors’ intention to annually return to the Annual General Meeting with proposals for share saving plans with equivalent conditions and effects. In case the conditions for the assumptions on number of employees that may be offered to participate in the share saving program or otherwise that is the basis for the calculations of the maximum size of the program change  the Board of Directors’ intends to return with a supplementary proposal to the Annual General Meeting 2024 regarding repurchase and transfer of own shares within Share Saving Plan 2024-2027  in order to ensure that all employees as per 31 December 2023 who wish to participate in the program can do so.Effects on key ratiosAs per the date of the Board of Directors’ proposal  the number of shares in the company amounts to 46 818 868. The Share Saving Plan 2024-2027 is expected to result in acquisition and transfer of a total of approximately 70 000 shares  which corresponds to approximately 0.15% of the total number of outstanding shares and votes. The key ratio earnings per share is not expected to be affected substantially.Majority resolutionDecision on the Board of Directors’ proposal under items A  B and C shall be made as a joint decision. The proposal  to be valid  must be supported by shareholders holding at least nine-tenths of both the number of votes cast  as well as of the number of shares represented at the meeting.Shareholders’ right to receive informationThe Board of Directors and CEO shall at the Annual General Meeting  if any shareholder so requests and the Board of Directors believes that it can be done without material harm to the company  provide information regarding circumstances that may affect the assessment of an item on the agenda  circumstances that may affect the assessment of the company’s or its subsidiaries’ financial situation and the company’s relation to another company within the group.Available documentsThe Nomination Committee’s reasoned statement and form of power of attorney are available at the company and on the company’s website  www.hms-networks.com .The Annual Report and Auditor’s Report for the parent company and the group for the 2022 financial year  the Board of Directors reasoned statement regarding the proposal for dividend and the Board of Directors complete proposal regarding items 14-16 and the auditors’ statement on whether the current guidelines for remuneration to senior executives have been complied with  will be available at the company and on the company’s website  www.hms-networks.com   no later than April 4  2023.The documents will be sent free of charge to shareholders who so request and state their postal address.

As a result of the change of stock exchange segment  the additional post-admission obligations of the Prime Standard no longer apply. These include  among others  the requirement to publish interim reports as of the reporting date of the 1st and 3rd quarters. This significantly reduces the costs associated with the listing for the Company. Furthermore  as announced in the aforementioned ad hoc announcement  Epigenomics AG has also terminated the existing American Depository Receipts (ADR) program (DR ISIN: US29428N3008) with the depositary  the Bank of New York Mellon  effective April 7  2023.

The tender offer  which was initially announced by Tetragon on 3 March 2023  will be conducted as a ""modified Dutch auction"" with shareholders able to tender their Tetragon non-voting shares at prices ranging from and including $9.25 up to and including $11.00 per share. The tender offer is expected to expire at 11:59 p.m. (ET) on 6 April 2023  unless extended or terminated earlier. J.P. Morgan Securities plc (which conducts its U.K. investment banking business as J.P. Morgan Cazenove) will act as dealer manager for the tender offer and Computershare Investor Services PLC will act as tender agent for the tender offer.Eligible shareholders will be able to indicate how many Tetragon non-voting shares and at what price or prices within the specified range they wish to tender. Based on the number of shares tendered and the prices specified by the tendering shareholders  J.P. Morgan  as dealer manager  will determine the lowest price per share within the range that will enable Tetragon to purchase $25 000 000 in value of Tetragon non-voting shares  or a lower amount if the tender offer is not fully subscribed. All shares purchased by Tetragon in the tender offer will be purchased at the same price. If  based on the determined purchase price  more than $25 000 000 in value of shares are properly tendered and not properly withdrawn  valid tenders made below the determined purchase price are expected to be accepted in full  except in the limited circumstances described below  while valid tenders made at the determined purchase price will be subject to proration. However  if the pro rata reduction of the number of shares eligible to be purchased at the determined purchase price is insufficient to reduce the value of the shares to be purchased to $25 000 000  then none of the shares tendered at the determined purchase price will be purchased  and instead there will be a pro rata reduction in the purchase of shares tendered at the next highest price below the determined purchase price to the extent necessary to reduce the value of shares purchased to $25 000 000. The determined purchase price  as well as the proration factor (if applicable)  is expected to be announced on or about 11 April 2023  and Tetragon expects the purchase of shares in the tender offer would be settled promptly thereafter.The tender offer is not conditioned upon the receipt of any minimum number of shares being tendered.This release is for informational purposes only and is neither an offer to buy nor the solicitation of an offer to sell any shares of Tetragon. The full details of the tender offer  including complete instructions on how to tender shares  are included in the offer to purchase which is available on Tetragon's website at the following URL:https://www.tetragoninv.com/shareholders/share-repurchasesShareholders should read carefully the offer to purchase because it contains important information.

Fully audited by an independent third party  this report outlines the company’s significant sustainability performance.“Our sustainability performance over the past year contributes actively to Tarkett's ambition: to be the easiest  the most innovative and the most sustainable flooring and sports surfaces company to work for and to work with. The pursuit of ‘always more’ is threatening our planet. We need to find a way to deliver more with less. For us  this means less waste  lower emissions and greater well-being. Doing more with less is our commitment  our mission and our mindset."" said Fabrice Barthélemy  CEO of Tarkett.In 2022  Tarkett’s ambitious climate goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 were approved by the independent Science Based Target initiative (SBTi).1 The world’s leading climate performance and reporting platform  CDP  recognized the company’s climate action through a leadership level A- score. Moreover  the renowned sustainability rating agency EcoVadis gave a Gold Medal to Tarkett and ranked the company among the top 2% performing companies of all 90 000 rated organizations in 172 countries.Lower EmissionsScope 1 & 2 greenhouse gas emissions from manufacturing operations were reduced by 41% versus 2019  notably through the increased purchase of electricity coming from renewable energies.Scope 3 emissions also decreased by 13% versus 2019  linked to the evolution of our product mix  the actions taken to decarbonize our products and the progress in the share of recycled materials which now reach 17% (vs. 15% in 2021)2. In 2022  43% of the company’s total energy consumption came from renewable energies. 13 production sites purchased 100% electricity coming from renewable energies.Story continuesLess WasteTarkett has reached strong progress with ReStart®  its take-back and recycling program  by transforming end-of-use flooring and recycled materials into new floors. This helps reducing waste and carbon footprint  diminishing the need for virgin raw materials while avoiding landfill and incineration. In the last 12 years  the company has collected the equivalent of 11 Eiffel Towers (115 000 tons) of flooring through Restart®  into its eight recycling centers. The program is now deployed in 26 different countries  including in Europe  as well as North America  Brazil and India.Throughout the year  Tarkett expanded circular collaboration with its customers and multiplied ReStart ® flooring take-back and recycling projects across the globe. For example  several more IKEA stores in Sweden and seven other European countries returned post-use flooring to Tarkett for recycling into new floors. The recovered homogeneous vinyl flooring is returned through Restart ® to Tarkett’s on-site recycling facility in Ronneby (Sweden). Since this collaboration began in 2020  Tarkett has received more than 30 000 square meters of used flooring. This will help avoid more than 300 tons of CO₂. Within Tarkett Sports Division  our FieldTurf’s Goal Zero program in North America helps diverting job-site waste from landfill and facilitating its reuse and recycling. In 2022  we recovered over 4 250 pallets of old artificial turf  diverting them from landfill  and recycling 182 tons of material (403 000 pounds).Greater Well-BeingFor many years  Tarkett has been proactively seeking alternatives to phthalate plasticizers in collaboration with its suppliers. The company has considerably invested in research and development and modified its formulas and processes to manufacture vinyl flooring with phthalate-free plasticizer technology . As of today  100% of our vinyl production sites in Europe  North America  Brazil  Ukraine  Serbia  and China use phthalate-free plasticizer technology. Last year  Tarkett made phthalate-free vinyl flooring the only option in Brazil with the successful transition of our local production site in Jacareí to phthalate-free technology.Coping with the most stringent world standards in terms of indoor air quality  99% of our flooring solutions have low volatile organic compounds emission levels  which is ten times lower than strictest standards.Supporting our teams and local communitiesTarkett has made further progress in terms of supporting its teams and local communities throughout 2022. Committed to Diversity & Inclusion  the share of women in management positions reached 27% in 2022  progressing towards our 2025 target of 30%. The first Diversity and Inclusion week organized across Tarkett locations continued to raise awareness among its teams.By providing a wide range of training and coaching courses  Tarkett ensured continuous training opportunities for its teams on key topics such as product knowledge  sustainability  health and safety  compliance  as well as leadership development. Throughout the year  Tarkett trained its employees across the globe during a total of 252 000 hours and rolled out its new Leadership Program . The program is conducted over 8 months with remote on-line activities  an off-site residential seminar and leaders being supported by external executive coaches.Since the launch of Tarkett Academy   52 000 professionals and students have also been trained as professional installers and in flooring installation techniques in our eleven Tarkett Academy centers across 8 countries.Since our Tarkett Cares program supporting local communities was launched  our teams involved in over 800 community initiatives  with employees volunteering 3 500 days and over 1.1 million euros of product donations. Throughout the year  Tarkett Cares continued to support many communities' initiatives  including solidarity and aid to people affected by the war in Ukraine. Employees mobilized in fundraising activities  blood donations and charity collections.Media ContactBrunswick - tarkett@brunswickgroup.com - +33 (0) 1 53 96 83 83Tarkett – communication@tarkett.comAbout TarkettWith a history of more than 140 years  Tarkett is a worldwide leader in innovative and sustainable flooring and sports surface solutions  generating net sales of € 3.4 billion in 2022.

A report with an unqualified opinion is being issued by the Statutory Auditors.Commenting on the 2022 results  Jean-Charles Decaux  Chairman of the Executive Board and Co-CEO of JCDecaux  said:“Our 2022 Group revenue grew by +20.8%  +16.6% on an organic basis  to reach €3 316.5 million driven by a strong digital revenue growth and a continued strong trading momentum. Our organic revenue growth outside China was +24.1% for the full-year 2022.Our Digital Out Of Home (DOOH) revenue grew by +41.1% in full-year 2022  +35.2% on an organic basis  to reach a record 31.4% of Group revenue in 2022  while analogue advertising revenue grew double digit organically in 2022. We maintained our focus on the selective roll-out of digital screens in prime locations  as well as on the development of our data capabilities. Programmatic advertising revenues through the VIOOH SSP (supply-side platform)  which constitute mostly incremental revenue from innovative dynamic data-driven campaigns and new advertisers  doubled in 2022 to reach €61.3 million i.e. 5.9% of our digital revenue in full-year 2022 as the DOOH programmatic ecosystem  including Displayce following our strategic alliance announced in July 2022  continued to gain traction.Our client portfolio remained highly diversified as our top 10 clients represent c.14% of our revenue in 2022. Our number one client category Fashion/Personal care and Luxury Goods made up 17% of total revenue and continued to grow strongly at +41% in 2022. Client categories recovering after Covid came back strongly such as Travel at +54% and Entertainment/Leisure at +31%.Story continuesWith revenue growing by €571.9m in 2022  our adjusted operating margin has reached €602.9m improving by €180.7m  +42.8% year-on-year  18.2% of total revenue in 2022  +280bp vs 2021  reflecting our strong operating leverage despite a historically low level of activity in China due to mobility restrictions. Our net result Group share is back to positive territory at €132.1m an increase by €146.7m year-on-year consistent with the improvement of our operational performance. Our operating cash flows improved by €161.8m to €399.4m and our free-cash-flow reached €43.2m in 2022 as capex increased notably due to a higher contract gains and renewals activity including more than half of the payment for the advertising rights of the 15-year contract with Shanghai Metro. Our net debt increased slightly by €50.5m  mainly driven by bolt-on M&A investments  reaching €975.0m at the end of the period with a financial leverage at 1.6x (vs 2.2x at the end of 2021).Recognized as best in class by extra-financial rating institutions (EcoVadis: Platinum  CDP: A-)  we continued to strengthen our ESG leading initiatives and commitments in 2022 as we have notably unveiled in May 2022 our ambitious 2030 ESG Strategy and we continued to reduce our carbon footprint  which is now at -27% in 2022 vs 2019 (scopes 1  2 and 3). Our highly positive business model financing public services and public transportation contributes to mitigate climate change. Almost 50% of our 2022 revenues are thus eligible and aligned with the European taxonomy. Today we announce our new Climate Strategy  “committed SBTi”  which includes strong proactive commitments to further optimize our carbon footprint such as reducing by 2030  scopes 1 and 2 emissions  by 60%  scope 3 emissions by 46% and reaching Net Zero by 2050 (scopes 1  2 and 3).As far as Q1 2023 is concerned  we now expect an organic revenue growth rate at around +2.5% including a double-digit revenue decline in China where we start seeing an inflection point from March as mobility is returning to normal.As the most digitised global OOH media company  with our new data-led audience targeting and programmatic solutions  our well diversified portfolio  our ability to win new contracts  the strength of our balance sheet  the high quality of our teams across the world and our recognised ESG excellence  we believe we are well positioned to benefit from the rebound. We are more than ever confident in the power of our media in an advertising landscape increasingly fragmented and more and more digital and in the role it will play to drive economic growth as well as positive changes.”Following the adoptions of IFRS 11 from January 1st  2014 and IFRS 16 from January 1st  2019  and in compliance with the AMF’s instructions  the operating data presented below are adjusted:to include our prorata share in companies under joint control  regarding IFRS 11 to exclude the impact of IFRS 16 on our core business lease agreements (lease agreements of locations for advertising structures excluding real estate and vehicle rental contracts).Please refer to the paragraph “Adjusted data” on page 4 of this release for the definition of adjusted data and reconciliation with IFRS.The values shown in the tables are generally expressed in millions of euros. The sum of the rounded amounts or variations calculations may differ  albeit to an insignificant extent  from the reported values.ADJUSTED REVENUEAs reported on January 26th  2023  adjusted revenue increased by +20.8%  +16.6% on an organic basis  to €3 316.5 million compared to €2 744.6 million in 2021.By activity  Transport and Street Furniture rebounded the most followed by Billboard.Full-Yearadjusted revenue 2022 (€m) 2021 (€m) Reported growth Organic growth(a) Street Furniture 1 747.0 1 440.1 +21.3% +18.5% Transport 1 075.2 877.8 +22.5% +15.0% Billboard 494.3 426.7 +15.9% +13.5% Total 3 316.5 2 744.6 +20.8% +16.6%(a) Excluding acquisitions/divestitures and the impact of foreign exchangeAll geographies performed strongly with a double-digit revenue growth in 2022 except Asia-Pacific as China was impacted by historically low mobility levels.Full-Year adjusted revenue 2022 (€m) 2021 (€m) Reported growth Organic growth(a) Europe (b) 988.3 824.5 +19.9% +20.2% Asia-Pacific 721.5 695.9 +3.7% -2.4% France 598.0 532.6 +12.3% +12.1% Rest of the World 416.8 274.9 +51.6% +36.4% United Kingdom 322.5 253.3 +27.4% +26.3% North America 269.3 163.4 +64.8% +45.5% Total 3 316.5 2 744.6 +20.8% +16.6%(a) Excluding acquisitions/divestitures and the impact of foreign exchange(b) Excluding France and the United KingdomADJUSTED OPERATING MARGIN (1)For 2022  our adjusted operating margin has significantly improved by €180.7 million to reach €602.9 million (vs €422.3 million in 2021)  a +42.8% increase year-on-year reflecting a strong operating leverage due to a tight control over our cost base growing at a slower pace than our revenue growth despite the negative impact from the decrease of revenue in China year-on-year. The adjusted operating margin as a percentage of revenue was 18.2% in 2022  +280bp above prior year.The adjusted operating margin as a percentage of revenue by business segment:2022 2021 Change 22/21 €m % of revenue €m % of revenue Change (€m) Margin rate (bp) Street Furniture 417.7 23.9% 323.4 22.5% +94.3 +140bp Transport 118.3 11.0% 58.2 6.6% +60.1 +440bp Billboard 67.0 13.5% 40.7 9.5% +26.3 +400bp Total 602.9 18.2% 422.3 15.4% +180.7 +280bpADJUSTED EBIT (2)In 2022  adjusted EBIT before impairment charge improved by €195.7 million to €212.0 million. As a percentage of revenue  this represented a 580bp increase to 6.4%  from +0.6%. Excluding the positive impact from the accounting revaluation of our stake in Interstate JCDecaux  adjusted EBIT before impairment charge for 2022 reached 5.1% as a percentage of revenue.The net impairment charge on tangible and intangible assets  rights-of-use assets and joint-ventures of €19.1 million in 2022 is mainly related to assets in China reflecting the historically low level of activity due to mobility restrictions in this geography.Adjusted EBIT  after impairment charge  has improved by €184.3 million from €8.7 million in 2021 to €193.0 million in 2022.NET FINANCIAL INCOME / (LOSS) (3)In 2022  interest expenses on IFRS 16 leases were quite stable at -€84.1 million compared to -€82.2 million in 2021  the mechanical reduction of the IFRS 16 lease liability related to the contract life progression being compensated by the additions coming from new contracts  contracts extended and contracts renewed.In 2022  excluding IFRS 16  other net financial income / (loss) was -€55.0 million compared to -€42.8 million in 2021  a variation of -€12.2 million mainly due the impact of currency hedges and the increase in financial interests from the €500 million bond issued in February 2022.EQUITY AFFILIATESIn 2022  the share of net profit from equity affiliates was €8.6 million  a decrease of €40.0 million mainly due to an impairment charge on our investment in Clear Media reflecting the historically low level of activity due to mobility restrictions in this geography.NET INCOME GROUP SHAREIn 2022  net income Group share turned positive as it increased by €146.7 million to €132.1 million compared to -€14.5 million in 2021  which mainly came from the improvement in our operational performance  the net positive impact from the accounting revaluation of our stake in Interstate JCDecaux being partly offset by the net negative impact of the impairment charges over the period.ADJUSTED CAPITAL EXPENDITUREIn 2022  adjusted net capex (acquisition of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets  net of disposals of assets) at €349.9 million increased by €192.4 million  +68.2% year-on-year  mainly driven by the pick-up in tenders in 2022 following Covid delays including €84.9 million of payment for advertising rights related to the renewal and extension of our long-term partnership with Shanghai Metro. Excluding this specific payment  the capex to sales ratio amounted to 8% consistent with the average ratio over the last 10 years.ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW (4)In 2022  operating cash flows reached +€399.4 million improving by +€161.8 million compared to 2021 mainly driven by the improving operating margin. Changes in our working capital had almost no impact on the cash-flow generation during the period (-€6.4 million) despite the strong increase in revenue thanks to an ongoing tight management over cash collection and payments. After capital expenditure  adjusted free cash flow amounted to €43.2 million.DIVIDENDNo dividend was paid in 2022 in order to strengthen Group’s liquidity  balance sheet and financial flexibility.To continue to reinforce our capacity to seize future organic and external bolt-on investment opportunities  we will propose at the Annual General Meeting which will take place on May 16th  2023  not to pay any dividend in 2023.NET DEBT (5)Net debt amounted to €975.0 million as of December 31st  2022  a slight increase vs December 31st  2021 where it stood at €924.5 million mainly driven by bolt on M&A activity.In January 2023  we decided to take advantage of the good market conditions to extend our debt maturity schedule and secured our financing profile with the issuance of a €600 million bond with a maturity in 2029 and a coupon at 5.00%. Subscribed more than 2 times and placed with investors of high quality  the success of this new issuance demonstrates both the quality of JCDecaux’s signature and the investors’ confidence in the rebound capacity and in the growth potential of the Group.RIGHT-OF-USE & LEASE LIABILITIES IFRS 16Right-of-use IFRS 16 as of December 31st  2022 amounted to €2 725.3 million compared to €2 964.8 million as of December 31st  2021  a decrease related to the amortisation of rights-of-use and contracts renegotiations partially offset by foreign exchange rate impacts  perimeter impacts  new contracts  contracts extended and contracts renewed.IFRS 16 lease liabilities decreased from €3 655.8 million as of December 31st  2021 to €3 412 1 million as of December 31st  2022. The decrease  mainly related to repayments occurred in 2022 as well as renegotiations and end of contracts is partially offset by new contracts  extensions and renewals  a positive foreign exchange rates impact and a positive perimeter impact.ADJUSTED DATAUnder IFRS 11  applicable from January 1st  2014  companies under joint control are accounted for using the equity method.Under IFRS 16  applicable from January 1st  2019  a lease liability for contractual fixed rental payments is recognised on the balance sheet  against a right-of-use asset to be depreciated over the lease term. As regards P&L  the fixed rent expense is replaced by the depreciation of the right-of-use in EBIT  below the operating margin  and a lease interest expense on the lease liability in financial result  below EBIT. IFRS 16 has no impact on cash payments but payment of debt (principal) is booked in funds from financing activities.However  in order to reflect the business reality of the Group and the readability of our performance  our operating management reports used to monitor the activity  allocate resources and measure performance continue:To integrate on proportional basis operating data of the companies under joint control and;To exclude the IFRS 16 impact on our core business (lease agreements of locations for advertising structures excluding real estate and vehicle rental contracts).As regards the P&L  it concerns all aggregates down to the EBIT. As regards the cash flow statement  it concerns all aggregates down to the free cash flow.Consequently  pursuant to IFRS 8  Segment Reporting presented in the financial statements complies with the Group’s internal information  and the Group’s external financial communication therefore relies on this operating financial information. Financial information and comments are therefore based on “adjusted” data  consistent with historical data  which is reconciled with IFRS financial statements.In 2022  the impacts of IFRS 11 and IFRS 16 on our adjusted aggregates are:-€242.5 million for IFRS 11 on adjusted revenue (-€222.1 million for IFRS 11 in 2021) leaving IFRS revenue at €3 074.0 million (€2 522.5 million in 2021).-€60.6 million for IFRS 11 and €780.2 million for IFRS 16 on adjusted operating margin(-€58.9 million for IFRS 11 and €800.5 million for IFRS 16 in 2021) leaving IFRS operating margin at €1 322.5 million (€1 163.9 million in 2021).-€45.0 million for IFRS 11 and €114.1 million for IFRS 16 on adjusted EBIT before impairment charge (-€39.5 million for IFRS 11 and €99.5 million for IFRS 16 in 2021) leaving IFRS EBIT before impairment charge at €281.1 million (€76.2 million in 2021).-€43.6 million for IFRS 11 and €114.1 million for IFRS 16 on adjusted EBIT after impairment charge (-€39.5 million for IFRS 11 and €99.5 million for IFRS 16 in 2021) leaving IFRS EBIT after impairment charge at €263.4 million (€68.6 million in 2021).€8.1 million for IFRS 11 on adjusted capital expenditure (€7.2 million for IFRS 11 in 2021) leaving IFRS capital expenditure at -€341.8 million (-€150.3 million in 2021).€12.1 million for IFRS 11 and €702.5 million for IFRS 16 on adjusted free cash flow (-€7.8 million for IFRS 11 and €647.8 million for IFRS 16 in 2021) leaving IFRS free cash flow at €757.8 million (€851.5 million in 2021).The full reconciliation between adjusted figures and IFRS figures is provided on page 8 of this release.NOTES(1) Operating Margin: Revenue less Direct Operating Expenses (excluding Maintenance spare parts) less SG&A expenses.(2) EBIT: Earnings Before Interests and Taxes = Operating Margin less Depreciation  amortization and provisions (net) less Impairment of goodwill less Maintenance spare parts less Other operating income and expenses.(3) Net financial income / (loss): Excluding the net impact of discounting and revaluation of debt on commitments to purchase minority interests (€3.6 million and -€2.1 million in FY 2022 and FY 2021 respectively).(4) Free cash flow: Net cash flow from operating activities less capital investments (property  plant and equipment and intangible assets) net of disposals.(5) Net debt: Debt net of managed cash less bank overdrafts  excluding the non-cash IAS 32 impact (debt on commitments to purchase minority interests)  including the non-cash IFRS 9 impact on both debt and hedging financial derivatives and excluding IFRS 16 lease liabilities.ORGANIC GROWTH DEFINITIONThe Group’s organic growth corresponds to the adjusted revenue growth excluding foreign exchange impact and perimeter effect. The reference fiscal year remains unchanged regarding the reported figures  and the organic growth is calculated by converting the revenue of the current fiscal year at the average exchange rates of the previous year and taking into account the perimeter variations prorata temporis  but including revenue variations from the gains of new contracts and the losses of contracts previously held in our portfolio.€m Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 FY 2021 adjusted revenue (a) 454.3 628.1 706.5 955.8 2 744.6 2022 IFRS revenue (b) 628.5 739.3 747.5 958.7 3 074.0 IFRS 11 impacts (c) 54.4 52.5 60.9 74.7 242.5 2022 adjusted revenue (d) = (b) + (c) 683.0 791.8 808.4 1 033.3 3 316.5 Currency impacts (e) -20.9 -28.3 -37.8 -26.0 -113.0 2022 adjusted revenue at 2021 exchange rates (f) = (d) + (e) 662.1 763.5 770.6 1 007.3 3 203.5 Change in scope (g) 0.0 0.0 -0.4 -3.0 -3.4 2022 adjusted organic revenue (h) = (f) + (g) 662.1 763.5 770.2 1 004.3 3 200.1 Organic growth (i) = (h) / (a) -

20188,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aegon-hosts-educational-webinar-ifrs-093000942.html,Aegon hosts educational webinar on IFRS 17 and IFRS 9,The Hague  March 9  2023 - Aegon will today host an educational webinar to outline its implementation of the accounting standards IFRS 17 and IFRS 9  which...,Aegon N.V.The Hague  March 9  2023 - Aegon will today host an educational webinar to outline its implementation of the accounting standards IFRS 17 and IFRS 9  which have become effective on January 1  2023. IFRS 17 is the first international accounting standard for insurance contracts and aims to create more consistency and comparability between companies. While the new accounting standard will impact Aegon’s financial reporting  it will not impact its strategy  capital management approach  financial targets  and outlook.During the webinar  Aegon will explain the choices it has made in implementing IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 and the impact of the new standards on its balance sheet and income statement by using selected key financial information.Reducing earnings volatilityThe new standard more closely aligns the valuation of assets and liabilities  which will reduce the impact from accounting mismatches in the financial results compared with the previous standards. Aegon has made accounting choices in implementing IFRS 17 where possible that allow for alignment of earnings with the relevant local capital frameworks and limit earnings volatility from accounting mismatches.Financial impact of the transition to new accounting standardsIn the IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 opening balance sheet of January 1  2022  Aegon’s shareholders’ equity is expected to decline to around EUR 11.7 billion from around EUR 17.8 billion excluding revaluation reserves under IFRS 4. This reflects the establishment of a contractual service margin (CSM) of EUR 11.8 billion pre-tax. The CSM represents a substantial stock of future value that is expected to be released through the operating result over time and to lead to a higher operating result than under IFRS 4.Further details will be shared during the educational webinar  that will be hosted by Matt Rider  CFO  and Jan Willem Weidema  Head of Investor Relations. The webinar will commence at 12:30 pm CET and a link to register for the livestream is available on the corporate website. After the presentation  analysts will have the opportunity to ask questions through the webinar platform. A replay will be available later today.Story continuesThe link to access the webinar  the supporting presentation and explanatory videos are located on the investor relations page of our website at aegon.com.About AegonAegon is an integrated  diversified  international financial services group.

Under the theme “making the difference for people and planet” we give...,ING GroupING publishes 2022 Annual ReportING today published its 2022 Annual Report. Under the theme “making the difference for people and planet” we give stakeholders an insight into our strategy  business activities and performance over the past year. Our activities are presented in the context of our strategic priorities: providing a superior customer experience and putting sustainability at the heart of what we do.On Sustainability  the report includes enhanced disclosures around our climate ambition and sustainable finance. With our Terra approach  we aim to steer the most carbon-intensive parts of our loan book towards net zero by 2050. In 2022  to promote immediate action towards decarbonisation  we set intermediate 2030 targets for all nine Terra sectors. We also reinforced our commitment to support the energy transition  announcing an aim to grow new commitments in renewable energy production by 50% by the end of 2025  as compared to 2021. Already  renewables comprise around 60% of our power generation portfolio. In 2022  we also announced to end the provision of dedicated upstream finance to new oil and gas fields.We also report on the four areas enabling us to execute our strategy: providing a seamless digital experience  using our scalable Tech and Ops  staying safe and secure and unlocking our people’s full potential. On the latter  the report highlights our commitment to diversity  inclusion and belonging  including an analysis of the gender pay gap. We realise there is more to be done in this area  especially on the underrepresentation of women in leadership positions. We introduced a new target of at least 30% female representation in our senior management by 2025 and 35% in 2028. In 2022  that figure was 29%. The report describes initiatives such as changing how we hire  progress and retain talented women  with a bank-wide action plan introduced in 2022.A major factor in 2022 affecting our company  customers and employees was the war in Ukraine - an immense human tragedy. We decided to do no new business with Russian clients and to get existing exposures repaid as quickly as possible - in effect setting a course for ending our involvement in Russia. Our total Russia-related exposures more than halved from the amount at the end of February 2022. Our global results in connection with these exposures declined sharply as we recognised significant risk costs. This was partly offset by results of our local subsidiary  also driven by interest rate and currency developments. Going forward  we will continue to actively reduce our Russia-related credit exposure.Story continuesThe report features interviews with ING’s chief executive officer Steven van Rijswijk and Hans Wijers  chairman of the Supervisory Board  as well as sections on Risk Management  Corporate Governance and the definitive consolidated and parent company financial statements.

This is creating demand uncertainty for the year. We will keep working closely with our customers and suppliers to react quickly to any market events  and to keep delivering on our commitments to them and to our other stakeholders. Considering all this  we are confident of delivering on our guidance for 2023”.Story continuesI- 2022 Key Highlights & 2023 OutlookIn € million  continuing operations 2022 2021 Change at current rate Change at Constant Rate Revenues 2 776 2 250 23.4% 11.4% Adjusted EBITDA 161 141 14.3% 3.7% As a % of revenues 5.8% 6.3% (46bps) (43 bps) Adjusted EBITA 55 39 39.7% 28.2% Free Cash Flow before Financial & Tax 88 (112) 200 1872022 Key Hi ghlightsThe group’s growth has been fueled by higher broadband volumes thanks to the success of our Fiber and Wi Fi 6 offer  price increases to partially recover cost inflation  and improved product-mix at the Connected Home division. Supply Chain Solutions’ performance has been negatively impacted by lower demand in optical discs against a strong base of comparison.Vantiva revenues totaled €2 776 million  up 23.4% (+11.4% at constant exchange rate).Connected Home revenues amounted to €2 120 million for the fiscal year  an increase of 37.3% (+23.3% at constant exchange rate). Supply Chain Solutions revenues were €655 million  down 6.6% (-14.3% at constant exchange rate).Adjusted EBITDA improvement stems from the product mix-effect for Connected Home  better pass through of additional costs versus last year  and strict cost control in both divisions.The group’s adjusted EBITDA reached €161 million in the year  a €20 million improvement over last year. The margin dilution  from 6.3% to 5.8%  resulted from the higher contribution of the Connected Home division to the group’s adjusted EBITDA (+10pts) and a lower gross margin in percentage terms.Connected Home contributed €135 million (versus €103 million last year) to adjusted EBITDA while Supply Chain Solutions contributed €56 million (versus €67 million last year).FCF  before financial and tax  in the year was positive at €88 million  showing a €200 million improvement over last year  largely explained by the change in working capital.OutlookVisibility on the level of demand for Connected Home products is limited as Network Services Providers (NSP) are carefully managing their inventories  especially in the US  in a context of economic uncertainty. In 2023  Vantiva forecasts continuing growth for broadband products but anticipates a decline for video devices. Therefore revenues of Connected Home division are expected to be down  but on a challenging base of comparison due to the strong performance achieved last year.For SCS  activity should remain on the same trend as last year with a natural decline in demand for optical discs  but increased revenues for “growth activities”. The increase in vinyl production capacity should be the main growth driver in the latter area. Globally  the group expects a slight decrease in the division’s revenues.Management also anticipates a persistent inflationary environment. However  thanks to operational efficiency and despite this context  the group is confident of meeting the following targets in 2023:EBITDA > €140mEBITA > € 45mFCF(1) > €50m(1) Before interests and taxII- Segment Review – Full Year 2022 Results HighlightsConnected HomeRevenues breakdown by productIn € million 2022 2021 Change at current rate Change at constant rate Revenues 2 120 1 544 37.3% 23.3% o/w by product Broadband 1 598 996 60.5% 43.4% Video 522 548 -4.9% -13.3% EBITDA adj 135 103 30.6% 19.5% As a % of revenues 6.3% 6.7%Connected Home revenues contributed 76% of group revenues (69% in 2021) and totaled €2 120 million in 2022  up 37.3%. At constant exchange rate  the growth would have been +23.3% compared with 2021. This revenue development has been driven by the combined positive effect of pricing and product-mix outweighing the volume decrease. Broadband business has been the main growth driver in the year representing 75% of revenues versus 64% the prior year  while demand for video devices suffered in some geographies  and especially in India.Globally  delivered units were down 4.4% mostly due to a drop in demand in Asia Pacific  notably in India and for entry level video products.Adjusted EBITDA of the division accounted for 84% of the group’s adjusted EBITDA compared with 73% in 2021. It amounted to €135 million in 2022 (vs €103 million in 2021)  or 6.3% of revenue (vs 6.7% in 2021). Despite the improvement in euro terms  the EBITDA margin fell 32 basis points over last year. This is mostly due to the dilutive impact of the measures implemented for countering inflation which brought additional revenues with no margin contribution.Supply Chain SolutionsIn € million 2022 2021 Change at current rate Change at constant rate Revenues 655 701 -6.6% -14.3% EBITDA 56 67 -15.5% -21.7% As a % of revenues 8.6% 9.5%Supply Chain Solutions revenues totaled €655 million in 2022  down 6.6% from 2021. At constant exchange rate the decline would have been 14.3%. Beyond the structural decline of the optical disc activity  the performance of the year has been severely impacted by the decline in demand from one major customer and a high base of comparison. Distribution and freight businesses were also down in the year. While growing  the other activities  have not been able to offset entirely this decline. The group has successfully launched vinyl production delivering its first 2 million albums in the year. Performance was however penalized by a slower intake of new vinyl presses than planned due to delivery delays  which prevented us from meeting the strong demand.Adjusted EBITDA of the division amounted to €56 million (vs €67m in 2021)  or 8.6% of revenues (9.5% in 2021)  Margin decline mainly resulted from the lower volumes in optical discs  distribution and freight activities  despite the positive development in the “growth activities”. The decline in EBITDA has been mitigated by the continued benefits of the cost reduction plan started in 2020 and the first contribution of the vinyl activity. In addition  the group has swiftly implemented additional footprint adjustment measures to mitigate the negative impact of the lower revenues.Corporate & OtherIn € million 2022 2021 Change at current rate Change at constant rate Revenues 1 5 -75.5% -75.5% EBITDA (30) (29) -3.8% nm As a % of revenues ns nsCorporate & Other recorded revenues of €1 million versus €5 million last year as the group disposed of its licensing activities in May 2022.Adjusted EBITDA amounted to -€30 million in line with last year which stood at -€29 million.

The United Sates remained the first market of the group with 58% of revenues compared to 52% the previous year. The strong improvement of Connected Home (+37.3%) was driven by  North America  broadband products and forex  more than offsetting the decline of Supply Chain Solutions (-6.6%)  which was hit by lower optical disc demand.2022 Adjusted EBITDA amounted to €161 million  up 14.3% year-on-year and 3.7% at constant rate. The EBITDA margin dropped by 46 basis points to stand at 5.8% of revenues. This decline reflects a slightly lower margin for both divisions and the higher weight of Connected Home division in the group’s total as this division generates a lower margin than SCS in percentage terms2022 Adjusted EBITA of €55 million represented a €16 million year-on-year improvement. This resulted from the higher EBITDA and a moderate depreciation increase. EBITA margin improved by 23 basis points to 2.0% of revenues.PPA amortization was almost stable at -€31 million.Non-recurring items are coming from:restructuring costs accounting for -€17 million versus -€31 million in 2021 as the cost-cutting program “Panorama” launched by the division a few years ago is nearly completed other income and expenses that showed an expense of -€13 million related to litigations reserves and depreciation compared to income of €10 million in 2021 explained by a capital gain booked that year on disposals net impairment on non-current operating asset for -€5m vs -€2m in the previous year.EBIT from continuing operations was a -€11 million loss compared to -€13 million losses in 2021.The financial result totaled -€177 million in 2022  compared to -€117 million in 2021. About half of this amount stems from the costs related to the anticipated reimbursement as part of the spin off. Interest expenses  excluding operating leases  amounted to €84 million and included for 9 months the debt allocated to TCS during the spin off.Income tax amounted to -€30 million versus -€14 million in 2021.Result from associated is a loss of -€311 million  mostly explained by the depreciation of the value of our 35% stake in TCS.Net loss from continued operations amounted to -€529 million compared to -€143 million in 2021.Result of discontinued operations showed a profit of €680 million  explained by the gain booked on TCS’ valuation at the time of the spin off.Group net result therefore is a profit of €151 million in 2022  compared to a loss of -€140 million in 2021.FCF and debt analysisIn € million 2022 2021 Change at current rate Change at constant rate Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations 161 141 14.3% 3.7% Capex (80) (69) (11) Non-recurring items (cash impact) (50) (85) 35 Change in working capital and other assets and liabilities 57 (98) 155 Free Cash Flow from continuing operations before Tax & Financial 88 (112) na na31/12/2022 31/12/20211 Nominal gross debt (including Lease debt) 449 1 306 Cash and cash equivalent (167) (196) Net financial debt at nominal value (non IFRS) 282 1 110 IFRS adjustment (19) (71) Net financial debt (IFRS) 263 1 039(1) Debt TechnicolorFree Cash Flow went from €-112 million to €88 million. This significant improvement reflects the stronger EBITDA (+€20 million)  lower cash out for restructuring (+€39 million) and the change in working capital (+€155 million) while capex increased by €11 million.The change in working capital derived mainly from the negative impact related to changes in payment terms in 2021 with some Connected Home partners and new factoring facilities in 2022.Pension liabilities were down by -€66 million mainly due to a positive effect from discount rates of €49 million  and payments of €27 million.Cash outflow for restructuring totaled -€22 million in 2022 versus -€61 million in 2021. This sharp decrease is explained by the near completion of the cost optimization program launched in 2020.Capital expenditures amounted to -€80 million (up by €11 million). The majority is capitalized R&D for Connected Home. This increase reflects the attention paid by the group to innovation in order to supply state of the art technology.The cash position at the end of December 2022 was €167 million compared to €196 million at the end of December 2021.Net financial debt at nominal value amounted to €282 million at the end of December 2022 following the refinancing implemented at the time of the spin off.IFRS net debt amounted to €263 million as of December 31  2022.Post closing eventTechnicolor Creative Studios announced March 8th 2023  before market opening  that it had reached with its main shareholders and lenders an agreement on principle for its refinancing.

The support of our workforce in Cassino and the foresight of local and national officials further electrify our efforts to delight customers with clean  safe and affordable mobility.”Cassino is the second Stellantis plant publicly named to produce vehicles based on the STLA Large platform  joining the Windsor Assembly Plant in Canada.Opened in 1972  the Cassino Assembly Plant in Piedimonte San Germano  south central Italy is a highly automated plant using more than 1 200 robots and includes stamping  plating  painting and plastic parts operations. The plant puts a high emphasis on energy and resource conservation. It has cut its use of water by half since 2017 and captures solar energy via photovoltaic cells positioned in its parking lots.STLA Large is one of four BEV-centric  highly flexible vehicle architectures that underpins the Stellantis electrification plan. The STLA Large platform  the base for several upcoming vehicles from Stellantis brands  is designed to deliver up to 800 km/500 miles of electric range with Stellantis-designed electric drive modules (EDMs) and modular battery packs. Designers and engineers have the flexibility to adjust the platform’s length and width and powertrain configuration to tailor it to specific product designs.Stellantis is investing more than €30 billion through 2025 in electrification and software to deliver BEVs that meet customer demands  including class-leading fast charge capability.The investment is a key component of the Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan  which is led by deep emission cuts to slash CO2 in half by 2030  benchmarking 2021 metrics  and achieve carbon net zero by 2038 with single digit percentage compensation of the remaining emissions. Core targets for Dare Forward 2030 also include 100% of passenger car sales in Europe and 50% of passenger car and light-duty truck sales in the United States to be BEVs by the end of the decade; the ambition of doubling Net Revenues by 2030 (versus 2021) and sustaining double-digit Adjusted Operating Income margins throughout the decade; and the aim to become number one in customer satisfaction for products and services in every market by 2030.###About StellantisStellantis N.V.

The tender offer  which was initially announced by Tetragon on 3 March 2023  will be conducted as a ""modified Dutch auction"" with shareholders able to tender their Tetragon non-voting shares at prices ranging from and including $9.25 up to and including $11.00 per share. The tender offer is expected to expire at 11:59 p.m. (ET) on 6 April 2023  unless extended or terminated earlier. J.P. Morgan Securities plc (which conducts its U.K. investment banking business as J.P. Morgan Cazenove) will act as dealer manager for the tender offer and Computershare Investor Services PLC will act as tender agent for the tender offer.Eligible shareholders will be able to indicate how many Tetragon non-voting shares and at what price or prices within the specified range they wish to tender. Based on the number of shares tendered and the prices specified by the tendering shareholders  J.P. Morgan  as dealer manager  will determine the lowest price per share within the range that will enable Tetragon to purchase $25 000 000 in value of Tetragon non-voting shares  or a lower amount if the tender offer is not fully subscribed. All shares purchased by Tetragon in the tender offer will be purchased at the same price. If  based on the determined purchase price  more than $25 000 000 in value of shares are properly tendered and not properly withdrawn  valid tenders made below the determined purchase price are expected to be accepted in full  except in the limited circumstances described below  while valid tenders made at the determined purchase price will be subject to proration. However  if the pro rata reduction of the number of shares eligible to be purchased at the determined purchase price is insufficient to reduce the value of the shares to be purchased to $25 000 000  then none of the shares tendered at the determined purchase price will be purchased  and instead there will be a pro rata reduction in the purchase of shares tendered at the next highest price below the determined purchase price to the extent necessary to reduce the value of shares purchased to $25 000 000. The determined purchase price  as well as the proration factor (if applicable)  is expected to be announced on or about 11 April 2023  and Tetragon expects the purchase of shares in the tender offer would be settled promptly thereafter.The tender offer is not conditioned upon the receipt of any minimum number of shares being tendered.This release is for informational purposes only and is neither an offer to buy nor the solicitation of an offer to sell any shares of Tetragon.

These forward-looking statements are based on current plans  estimates and beliefs of management. All statements  other than statements of historical facts  are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements  including estimates of revenues  operating margins  capital expenditures  cash  other financial information  expected legal  arbitration  political  regulatory or clinical results or practices and other such estimates and results. By their nature  such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and assumptions which might cause the actual results  financial condition  performance or achievements of UCB  or industry results  to differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Important factors that could result in such differences include: the global spread and impact of COVID-19  changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  will progress to product approval or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products  which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB's efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover  sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment  including pricing pressure  political and public scrutiny  customer and prescriber patterns or practices  and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes. Finally  a breakdown  cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality  integrity and availability of UCB's data and systems.Given these uncertainties  you should not place undue reliance on any of such forward-looking statements. There can be no guarantee that the investigational or approved products described in this press release will be submitted or approved for sale or for any additional indications or labelling in any market  or at any particular time  nor can there be any guarantee that such products will be or will continue to be commercially successful in the future.UCB is providing this information  including forward-looking statements  only as of the date of this press release and it does not reflect any potential impact from the evolving COVID-19 pandemic  unless indicated otherwise. UCB is following the worldwide developments diligently to assess the financial significance of this pandemic to UCB. UCB expressly disclaims any duty to update any information contained in this press release  either to confirm the actual results or to report or reflect any change in its forward-looking statements with regard thereto or any change in events  conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based  unless such statement is required pursuant to applicable laws and regulations.Additionally  information contained in this document shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities  nor shall there be any offer  solicitation or sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer  solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of such jurisdiction.",neutral,0.0,0.92,0.08,mixed,0.74,0.05,0.21,True,English,"['Cancer Research UK', 'Oncology Antibody Candidates', 'Multi-Project Collaboration', 'UCB', 'human IgG4P anti-Gremlin-1 monoclonal antibody', 'late development Phase III trials', 'early Phase II clinical trials', 'Cancer Research UK press office', 'human leukocyte antigen G', 'multi-modular phase I/II study', 'advanced gastrointestinal (GI) tumors', 'The Cancer Research UK Centre', 'specialized connective tissue cells', 'new targeted treatment options', 'Nat Rev Clin Oncol', 'Antje Witte Investor Relations', 'Phase 1/2 clinical trials', 'two novel oncology antibodies', 'world leading oncology expertise', 'renowned antibody discovery expertise', 'ongoing UCB6114 clinical study', 'two investigational antibody candidates', 'investigational oncology antibody candidates', '140 potential new anti-cancer agents', 'J Clin Oncol.', '21 new anti-cancer agents', 'mesenchymal stromal cells', 'best oncology expertise', 'Two other drugs', 'oncology-focused translational research', 'strong research productivity', 'early clinical development', 'largest charitable funder', 'other supporting activities', 'undisclosed success-based milestone', 'Dr Nigel Blackburn', 'References Sarker D', 'media enquiries contact', 'Director Cancer Research', 'world-class cancer research', 'R&D Communications', 'central nervous system', 'new cancer treatments', 'global biopharmaceutical company', 'clinical development capabilities', 'chief scientific officer', 'Forward looking statements', 'UCB antibody candidates', 'clinical development collaboration', 'antibody expertise', 'new agents', 'investigational candidates', 'press release', 'chief clinical', 'novel treatments', 'clinical oncologists', 'cancer therapy', 'brain cancer', 'prostate cancer', 'ovarian cancer', 'disruptive candidates', 'class antibody', 'scientific investigators', 'Corporate Communications', 'immune system', 'Drug Development', 'preclinical development', 'cancer patients', 'immune checkpoint', 'exclusive rights', 'royalty payments', 'commercial partners', 'Dhaval Patel', 'large network', 'Financial details', 'extracellular matrix', 'Banerji U', 'Blagden SP', 'Valkenburg KC', 'Groot AE', 'Pienta KJ', 'Ellie Bennett', 'Laurent Schots', 'innovative medicines', 'severe diseases', 'impressive record', 'tumour stroma1', 'EURONEXT BRUSSELS', 'Scott Fleming', 'unparalleled access', 'Belgium', 'London', 'UCB4594', 'HLA-G.', 'terms', 'design', 'preparation', 'sponsorship', 'delivery', 'ONC001', 'assets', 'licence', 'results', 'return', 'funders', 'innovation', 'programmes', 'desire', 'drivers', 'partnership', 'Notes', 'editor', 'fibroblasts', 'monotherapy', 'combination', 'mFOLFOX6', 'trifluridine/tipiracil', 'TPS22', 'hours', 'solutions', 'lives', 'people', '40 countries', 'revenue', 'symbol', '25 years', 'portfolio', 'temozolomide', 'abiraterone', 'rucaparib', '020', '07884']",2023-03-09,2023-03-10,marketscreener.com

Audit procedures were conducted on the consolidated financial statements.In €m – IFRS – Audited data 2021 2022 Change REVENUE 225.4 245.9 +9% EBITDA[1] 15.2 22.8 +50% 6.7% 9.3% +2.6 pts CURRENT OPERATING INCOME 13.1 21.5 +64% 5.8% 8.7% +2.9 pts OPERATING INCOME (EBIT) 11.7 16.2 +38% 5.2% 6.6% +1.4 pt NET INCOME 5.3 7.7 +43%REVENUE GROWTH (+9%)SQLI accelerated its growth in 2022 with a 9% increase in consolidated revenue  mainly organic  to €245.9m. The implemented measures boosted its business in France  which grew +9.7% (€130.7m). The Group's international business (€115.2m)  up 8.4%  generated nearly 47% of its income.INCREASE IN EARNINGS FROM ORDINARY ACTIVITIES (+64%) AND NORMALISED NET INCOME (+100%)Thanks to this solid business growth  combined with higher margins  current operating profitability improved to €21.5m (8.7%).There was a significant increase in France  where its current operating profitability rose 3.5 points to 6.7%. With 11.0% profitability  international business was up 2.2 points.Operating income (EBIT) increased 38% to €16.2m  despite €5.3m in net non-current expenses (including approximately €3.0m associated with the 2022 takeover bid and the long-term incentive plan).Expenses related to the full refinancing accounted for €1.1m  the net cost of debt (€4.0m)  and the tax expense (€3.4m).The consolidated net profit was €7.7m compared with €5.3m in 2021. Restated for non-recurring expenses mainly related to the takeover bid and the refinancing  the normalised net profit would double to €11.9m.LOW NET DEBT/EQUITY RATIO (4%)SQLI generated €15.0m in free cash flow[2]. This flow includes the partial use of factoring reserves (€6.5m) to finance growth and takes into account non-recurring items (takeover bid  refinancing). SQLI therefore had gross cash of €22.2m at the end of 2022.In February 2022  SQLI completed a full refinancing by issuing a seven-year bullet bond for €28m and fully repaid its €49m in financial debt (syndicated and State-guaranteed loan). The group also negotiated two additional lines of credit (CAPEX credit and 36-month RCF line) for a total of €30m  not used to date  to finance its development.Net financial debt (excluding IFRS 16) totalled €5m for equity of €110.6m.OUTLOOKAfter a return to normal health conditions  the demand for digital experience services shows no signs of losing steam. Many companies in the B2B sectors still have plans to implement e-commerce and experience platforms and  in particular  marketplaces. In B2C  our large customers need to shift their systems towards more flexible architectures.SQLI is taking steps to meet these needs with the effective integration of its international subsidiaries  reorganisation by area of expertise in France  and ongoing investment in its development centre in Morocco. Thanks to the financing secured in 2022  SQLI will also be able to make targeted acquisitions.In this context  SQLI's goal is to maintain its revenue growth and continuously improve its profitability in 2023.Receive SQLI financial news free of charge by e-mail by signing up at: www.actusnews.comAbout SQLI: Founded in 1990  SQLI is a European digital services group that supports major international brands in creating value through Digital.

It brings together two high-tech industrial groups  Exail and Thales  and two leading academic teams from Université Paris-Saclay1 and Sorbonne Université2.The Quantum Communication Infrastructure initiative of the European Commission (EuroQCI) aims to build a secure quantum communication infrastructure that will span the whole EU  including its overseas territories. As an answer to the current lack of established QKD hardware suppliers to protect the EU strategic digital autonomy  QKISS's objective is to implement a complete and qualified telecom link that allows encrypted communications protected by the fundamental laws of physics  developed by French industrial and academic experts.The project  led by Exail  leverages the extensive expertise of the 4 partners involved. It will include the manufacturing of opto-electronic components  the development of specialized signal processing and coding algorithms  and go up to full system integration and field demonstrations. QKISS will also produce field evidence of compatibility with telecom network systems  with the QKD systems functioning together with Mistral encryptors from Thales (a turnkey network encryption system including a centralized management software  adapted to the specific QKD framework).Certifiability and compliance of the QKISS systems with EU standards will be included in the security analysis and the design strategy of the project at an early stage. To do so  limitation of attack surface  in-depth defense and common criteria evaluations for the protection profile will be considered. For this purpose  the design will feature a low number of external interfaces  a limited number of components for realistic system construction  an industrial architecture for legacy networks and use of QKD as an add-on to existing IT needs.Baptiste Gouraud  R&D engineer and project manager for Exail  states: “In practice  QKISS will consist in the implementation of a laser-telecom link between a transmitter called “AliX” and a receiver called ”BeatriX” thanks to optical fibers. Using the same technique as in long-haul optical communications  information will be transmitted through coherent modulation of light: it will be encoded in the amplitude and phase of the electromagnetic field but will be protected by the quantum detection noise. Coherent homodyne or heterodyne detection will be used to retrieve the quadrature value of the signal to read the key into it. The communication will thus be fully encrypted and protected by the fundamental laws of physics.”“Thales teams are eager to strengthen collaborations with partners within QKISS. The Group will contribute to meeting the high technical expectations of this project  by providing their expertise in specific signal processing for QKD  system design  security analysis and dedicated encryptors.” adds Stéphanie Molin  R&D project leader at Thales.According to Philippe Grangier  head of the Quantum Optic Group at the Institut d'Optique“The QKISS project builds upon a long experience of academic research on continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD)  starting with a highly-cited article published in 2003 (F. Grosshans and al.  Nature  421). After tremendous progress over the years  involving both academic and industry partners  the technology is now mature enough for industrial deployment. ““QKISS leverages and builds on the important recent developments and synergies pursued in the QKD field in the context of EU-funded projects (for instance  CiViQ and OpenQKD)”  adds Eleni Diamanti  CNRS Senior Researcher and team leader at LIP6 lab  at Sorbonne Université.The project targets a low-cost and high-rate implementation suitable for metro use-cases with very high speed of communication: modulation rate in hundreds of megabaud (MBd) and secure key rate in megabits per second (Mbit/s). After an industrialization phase  QKISS systems will be available for deployment in the EuroQCI and applications relying on private communications: e-banking  e-health  government communication or the management and protection of critical infrastructure.1 Team of Prof. Philippe Grangier at Institut d'Optique Graduate School2 Team of Dr. Eleni Diamanti at LIP6 laboratory (CNRS/Sorbonne Université)About Exail TechnologiesExail Technologies is the new name of Groupe Gorgé  adopted after the transformation of the group at the end of 2022  now focused on the activities of its subsidiary Exail.

Compared to 2019  sales in that region were up by +15%.FINANCIAL PERFORMANCEIn 2022  Maisons du Monde fully met its updated financial targets  thanks to the implementation of its forceful action plan to protect profit and cash in a soft consumption and highly inflationary environment.The Group succeeded in delivering its target of €5 million in cost savings at gross margin level and adjusting costs by €20 million at SG&A level to mitigate the impact of rising costs.EBIT margin at 5.5%  compared to an updated guidance of 5% or aboveGross margin  EBITDA  EBIT(in EUR million) 2022 2021%Change Sales 1 240.4 1 306.8 -5.1% Cost of goods sold (437.9) (438.2) -0.1% Gross margin 802.5 868.5 -7.6% As a % of Sales 64.7% 66.5% Store operating and central costs (355.0) (354.4) 0.2% Advertising costs (60.6) (64.9) -6.7% Logistics costs (159.8) (170.0) -6.0% Operating Costs (575.5) (589.4) -2.4% EBITDA 227.0 279.2 -18.7%As a % of Sales 18.3% 21.4% Depreciation  amortization  and allowance for provisions (158.5) (155.4) 2.0% EBIT 68.5 123.8 -43.6% As a % of Sales 5.5% 9.5%FY2022 gross margin came in at 64.7%  above the revised objective but down 180 bps compared to 66.5% in 2021.Facing adverse market conditions including a sharp increase in freight and raw material costs  energy price inflation and a material deterioration in the EUR/USD currency rate  the Group partly offset its gross margin erosion thanks to:a dynamic category mix management and discount strategy  containing the level of discount below 8% (similar to the pre-Covid period) gradual and selective price increases the generation of ambitious operating efficiencies  notably via further negotiations with suppliers  and freight forwarders and extra operational efficiencies.Store operating and central costs were broadly stable at €355 million vs €354 million in 2021  despite the inflationary context that impacted direct costs such as energy and rent and the reversal of €12 million in one-off unemployment subsidies and lease payment reductions that had been obtained in 2021. All initiatives to contain costs have been delivered on target. In December  Maisons du Monde paid to its employees an exceptional bonus as part of measures to support their purchasing power.Advertising expenses were managed with strict discipline  decreasing by 7% to €61 million vs €65 million in 2021. Focus was put on supporting online sales including the marketplace and on brand-reinforcing initiatives in a context of rising customer acquisition costs. Conversely  the discontinuation of paper catalogues resulted in substantial savings.Logistics costs decreased by 6% to €160 million compared to last year  even though the Group opened a second distribution center  thanks to further negotiations with carriers and enhanced efficiencies in operations.EBITDA was down -19% to €227 million with a margin at 18.3% vs €279 million in 2021 (margin at 21.4%)D&A expenses increased by €4 million at €159 million vs €155 million in 2021  mainly due to amortization directly linked to the €32 million increase in other intangible assets  property  plant and equipment and rights of use related to leases (IFRS 16).2022 EBIT reached €68.5 million with an associated margin of 5.5%. Other net operating expenses  at €5 million  were mainly related to store closure costs.Net financial result was €18 million vs €19 million in 2021  due to lower long-term debt and revolving credit facility interest expense compared to 2021  as well as gains on currency transactions.Income tax represented €18 million vs €26 million in 2021. The effective tax rate increased from 28% in 2021 to 35% due to a one-off international tax risk provision.Net income amounted to €34 million vs €79 million in 2021. EPS was €0.80  compared to €1.72 in 2021 (€1.52 without the positive 2021 effect of Modani’s disposal).Free Cash Flow above updated guidance  at €32 million(in EUR million) 31 Dec. 202231 Dec. 2021 EBITDA227.0 279.2 Change in working capital (2.8) 9.8 Change in other operating items (12.2) (37.9) Net cash generated by/ (used in) operating activities 212.0 251.1 Capital expenditures (Capex) (66.6) (51.5) Change in debt on fixed assets 5.3 2.4 Proceeds from sale of non-current assets 0.8 1.2 Decrease in lease debt (107.3) (102.1) Decrease in lease debt/Lease interest paid (11.8) (11.3) Free cash flow 32.3 89.8In 2022  total CAPEX amounted to €67 million  up +€15 million vs 2021  mainly related to the opening of the new distribution center and priority IT projects (Alma  Appshop and Marketplace). Conversely  the reduction in store openings (13 vs 21 in 2021) reduced network CAPEX needs.Regarding working capital requirement  the Group made significant headway on implementing more favorable payment term agreements with key suppliers. It also actively managed its shipping plans throughout the second half of 2022 to mitigate the excess inventory risk  while selectively rebuilding inventories to support upcoming sales. Inventory value was €246 million at year end (+€52 million vs 2021 mainly due to the material increase in cost of goods).Free cash flow amounted €32 million compared to €90 million in 2021  above the updated guidance of €10 million to €30 million  reflecting the €52 million decrease in EBITDA  additional capex described above  and negative effect of inventory offset by other working capital adjustments.Net financial debtNet debt & leverage(in EUR million) Net debt calculation31 Dec. 202231 Dec. 2021 Convertible bonds (“OCEANE”) 195.6 191.0 Term loan (0.5) - Revolving Credit Facilities (RCFs) (0.7) (0.1) Share buyback 28.1 29.3 Other debt 1.7 1.5 Gross debt 224.2 221.7 Finance leases 613.1 594.2 Cash & cash equivalents (121.3) (163.2) Net debt (IFRS 16) 716.0 652.6 Less: Lease debt (IFRS 16) (613.1) (594.2) Plus: Lease debt (finance lease) 2.2 2.7 Net debt 105.1 61.1 LTM (Last twelve months) EBITDA4 109.5 169.0 Leverage 0.96X 0.36XThe Group’s gross debt position as of 31 December 2022 was €224 million  broadly stable vs €222 million at the end of December 2021.

The cancellation will be effective on March 10th  2023. As a result  the Group’s share capital will amount to €133 million comprised of 40 988 097 shares.The Shareholders’ General Meeting is scheduled to be held on 29 June 2023  at which time shareholders will be asked to approve the payment of a dividend of €0.30 per share for the 2022 financial year  translating to a 37% pay-out ratio  in line with mid-term guidance (30%-40%).The ex-dividend date is 5 July 2023  with payment on 7 July 2023.2023: KEY PRIORITIES – GUIDANCE TO BE SPECIFIED IN MAYIn the context of high inflation and macroeconomic uncertainty  Maisons du Monde is fully committed to continuing to grow revenues by leveraging its highly attractive product portfolio and well-developed omnichannel approach. At the same time  the company will put clear emphasis on store productivity and operational excellence to restore its margins and return to robust cash generation. The company remains focused on developing a profitable and sustainable growth model  while capitalizing on its assets and strengths: Enhancing customer experience through its unique product portfolio and international omnichannel model to further increase customer loyalty and develop Maisons du Monde’s brand awareness  Continuing its ESG journey by further reducing its environmental impact and promoting equal opportunities as well as diversity and inclusion in its teams and beyond.Considering continued headwinds from macro trends that affect consumption and the high 2022 base for that period  we expect Q1 to be the low point of the year  with sales down in low double digits. The comparable base will start to ease in May and more so in the second half of the year.In this environment of persistently soft trading conditions  Maisons du Monde is developing forceful initiatives to preserve and improve its economic equation by adapting its cost structure and optimizing Capex with the ambition of progressively restoring its historical profitability level and cash generation. Maisons du Monde will specify its 2023 guidance in May.In the context of the current economic conditions  management is fully focused on the execution of the 2023 roadmap. As a result  the 2025 medium-term guidance is suspended until visibility improves.GOVERNANCEAs announced on January 25  2022  François-Melchior de Polignac will become Chief Executive Officer of Maisons du Monde from 15 March 2023.***Conference call for investors and analystsDate : 9 March 2023 at 09.00 am CETSpeakers :Julie Walbaum  CEO  François-Melchior de Polignac  Deputy CEO and Régis Massuyeau  CFOConnection details :***Financial calendar11 May 2023 Q1 2023 sales29 June 2023 Annual General Meeting27 July 2023 Q2 and H1 2022 financial results26 October 2023 Q3 and 9M 2022 salesDisclaimer: Forward Looking StatementThis press release contains certain statements that constitute ""forward-looking statements "" including but not limited to statements that are predictions of or indicate future events  trends  plans or objectives  based on certain assumptions or which do not directly relate to historical or current facts.

Fully audited by an independent third party  this report outlines the company’s significant sustainability performance.“Our sustainability performance over the past year contributes actively to Tarkett's ambition: to be the easiest  the most innovative and the most sustainable flooring and sports surfaces company to work for and to work with. The pursuit of ‘always more’ is threatening our planet. We need to find a way to deliver more with less. For us  this means less waste  lower emissions and greater well-being. Doing more with less is our commitment  our mission and our mindset."" said Fabrice Barthélemy  CEO of Tarkett.In 2022  Tarkett’s ambitious climate goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 were approved by the independent Science Based Target initiative (SBTi).1 The world’s leading climate performance and reporting platform  CDP  recognized the company’s climate action through a leadership level A- score. Moreover  the renowned sustainability rating agency EcoVadis gave a Gold Medal to Tarkett and ranked the company among the top 2% performing companies of all 90 000 rated organizations in 172 countries.Lower EmissionsScope 1 & 2 greenhouse gas emissions from manufacturing operations were reduced by 41% v ersu s 2019  notably through the increased purchase of electricity coming from renewable energies .Scope 3 emissions also decreased by 13% v ersus 2019  linked to the evolution of our product mix   the actions taken to decarbonize our products and the progress in the share of recycled materials which now reac h 17% (vs . 15% in 2021) 2 . In 2022  43% of the company’s total energy consumption came from renewable energies . 13 production sites purchased 100% electricity coming from renewable energies .Less WasteTarkett has reached strong progress with ReStart ®   its take-back and recycling program   by transforming end-of-use flooring and recycled materials into new floors. This helps reducing waste and carbon footprint  diminishing the need for virgin raw materials while avoiding landfill and incineration. In the last 1 2 years  the company has collected the equivalent of 11 Eiffel Towers (11 5  000 tons) of flooring through Restart ®   into its eight recycling centers. The program is now deployed in 26 different countries   including in Europe  as well as North America  Brazil and India.Throughout the year   Tarkett expanded circular collaboration with its customers and multiplied ReStart ® flooring take-back and recycling projects across the globe. For example  several more IKEA stores in Sweden and seven other European countries returned post-use flooring to Tarkett for recycling into new floors. The recovered homogeneous vinyl flooring is returned through Restart ® to Tarkett’s on-site recycling facility in Ronneby (Sweden). Since this collaboration began in 2020  Tarkett has received more than 30 000 square meters of used flooring. This will help avoid more than 300 tons of CO ₂ . Within Tarkett Sports Division  our FieldTurf’s Goal Zero program in North America helps diverting job-site waste from landfill and facilitating its reuse and recycling. In 2022  we recovered over 4 250 pallets of old artificial turf  diverting them from landfill  and recycling 182 tons of material (403 000 pounds).Greater Well-BeingFor many years   Tarkett has been proactively seeking alternatives to phthalate plasticizers in collaboration with its suppliers. The company has considerably invested in research and development and modified its formulas and processes to manufacture vinyl flooring with phthalate-free plasticizer technology . As of today   100% of our vinyl production sites in Europe  North America  Brazil  Ukraine  Serbia  and China use phthalate-free plasticizer technology. Last year  Tarkett made phthalate-free vinyl flooring the only option in Brazil with the successful transition of our local production site in Jacareí to phthalate-free technology.Coping with the most stringent world standards in terms of indoor air quality   99% of our flooring solutions have low volatile organic compounds emission levels   which is ten times lower than strictest standards .Supporting our teams and local communitiesTarkett has made further progress in terms of supporting its teams and local communities throughout 2022 . Committed to Diversity & Inclusion  the share of women in management positions reached 27% in 2022  progressing towards our 2025 target of 30%.

A report with an unqualified opinion is being issued by the Statutory Auditors. Commenting on the 2022 results  Jean-Charles Decaux  Chairman of the Executive Board and Co-CEO of JCDecaux  said: “Our 2022 Group revenue grew by +20.8%  +16.6% on an organic basis  to reach €3 316.5 million driven by a strong digital revenue growth and a continued strong trading momentum. Our organic revenue growth outside China was +24.1% for the full-year 2022. Our Digital Out Of Home (DOOH) revenue grew by +41.1% in full-year 2022  +35.2% on an organic basis  to reach a record 31.4% of Group revenue in 2022  while analogue advertising revenue grew double digit organically in 2022. We maintained our focus on the selective roll-out of digital screens in prime locations  as well as on the development of our data capabilities. Programmatic advertising revenues through the VIOOH SSP (supply-side platform)  which constitute mostly incremental revenue from innovative dynamic data-driven campaigns and new advertisers  doubled in 2022 to reach €61.3 million i.e. 5.9% of our digital revenue in full-year 2022 as the DOOH programmatic ecosystem  including Displayce following our strategic alliance announced in July 2022  continued to gain traction. Our client portfolio remained highly diversified as our top 10 clients represent c.14% of our revenue in 2022. Our number one client category Fashion/Personal care and Luxury Goods made up 17% of total revenue and continued to grow strongly at +41% in 2022. Client categories recovering after Covid came back strongly such as Travel at +54% and Entertainment/Leisure at +31%. With revenue growing by €571.9m in 2022  our adjusted operating margin has reached €602.9m improving by €180.7m  +42.8% year-on-year  18.2% of total revenue in 2022  +280bp vs 2021  reflecting our strong operating leverage despite a historically low level of activity in China due to mobility restrictions. Our net result Group share is back to positive territory at €132.1m an increase by €146.7m year-on-year consistent with the improvement of our operational performance. Our operating cash flows improved by €161.8m to €399.4m and our free-cash-flow reached €43.2m in 2022 as capex increased notably due to a higher contract gains and renewals activity including more than half of the payment for the advertising rights of the 15-year contract with Shanghai Metro. Our net debt increased slightly by €50.5m  mainly driven by bolt-on M&A investments  reaching €975.0m at the end of the period with a financial leverage at 1.6x (vs 2.2x at the end of 2021). Recognized as best in class by extra-financial rating institutions (EcoVadis: Platinum  CDP: A-)  we continued to strengthen our ESG leading initiatives and commitments in 2022 as we have notably unveiled in May 2022 our ambitious 2030 ESG Strategy and we continued to reduce our carbon footprint  which is now at -27% in 2022 vs 2019 (scopes 1  2 and 3). Our highly positive business model financing public services and public transportation contributes to mitigate climate change. Almost 50% of our 2022 revenues are thus eligible and aligned with the European taxonomy. Today we announce our new Climate Strategy  “committed SBTi”  which includes strong proactive commitments to further optimize our carbon footprint such as reducing by 2030  scopes 1 and 2 emissions  by 60%  scope 3 emissions by 46% and reaching Net Zero by 2050 (scopes 1  2 and 3). As far as Q1 2023 is concerned  we now expect an organic revenue growth rate at around +2.5% including a double-digit revenue decline in China where we start seeing an inflection point from March as mobility is returning to normal. As the most digitised global OOH media company  with our new data-led audience targeting and programmatic solutions  our well diversified portfolio  our ability to win new contracts  the strength of our balance sheet  the high quality of our teams across the world and our recognised ESG excellence  we believe we are well positioned to benefit from the rebound. We are more than ever confident in the power of our media in an advertising landscape increasingly fragmented and more and more digital and in the role it will play to drive economic growth as well as positive changes.” Following the adoptions of IFRS 11 from January 1st  2014 and IFRS 16 from January 1st  2019  and in compliance with the AMF’s instructions  the operating data presented below are adjusted: to include our prorata share in companies under joint control  regarding IFRS 11 to exclude the impact of IFRS 16 on our core business lease agreements (lease agreements of locations for advertising structures excluding real estate and vehicle rental contracts). Please refer to the paragraph “Adjusted data” on page 4 of this release for the definition of adjusted data and reconciliation with IFRS.The values shown in the tables are generally expressed in millions of euros. The sum of the rounded amounts or variations calculations may differ  albeit to an insignificant extent  from the reported values. ADJUSTED REVENUE As reported on January 26th  2023  adjusted revenue increased by +20.8%  +16.6% on an organic basis  to €3 316.5 million compared to €2 744.6 million in 2021.

The adjusted operating margin as a percentage of revenue was 18.2% in 2022  +280bp above prior year. The adjusted operating margin as a percentage of revenue by business segment: 2022 2021 Change 22/21 €m % of revenue €m % of revenue Change (€m) Margin rate (bp) Street Furniture 417.7 23.9% 323.4 22.5% +94.3 +140bp Transport 118.3 11.0% 58.2 6.6% +60.1 +440bp Billboard 67.0 13.5% 40.7 9.5% +26.3 +400bp Total 602.9 18.2% 422.3 15.4% +180.7 +280bp ADJUSTED EBIT (2) In 2022  adjusted EBIT before impairment charge improved by €195.7 million to €212.0 million. As a percentage of revenue  this represented a 580bp increase to 6.4%  from +0.6%. Excluding the positive impact from the accounting revaluation of our stake in Interstate JCDecaux  adjusted EBIT before impairment charge for 2022 reached 5.1% as a percentage of revenue. The net impairment charge on tangible and intangible assets  rights-of-use assets and joint-ventures of €19.1 million in 2022 is mainly related to assets in China reflecting the historically low level of activity due to mobility restrictions in this geography. Adjusted EBIT  after impairment charge  has improved by €184.3 million from €8.7 million in 2021 to €193.0 million in 2022. NET FINANCIAL INCOME / (LOSS) (3) In 2022  interest expenses on IFRS 16 leases were quite stable at -€84.1 million compared to -€82.2 million in 2021  the mechanical reduction of the IFRS 16 lease liability related to the contract life progression being compensated by the additions coming from new contracts  contracts extended and contracts renewed. In 2022  excluding IFRS 16  other net financial income / (loss) was -€55.0 million compared to -€42.8 million in 2021  a variation of -€12.2 million mainly due the impact of currency hedges and the increase in financial interests from the €500 million bond issued in February 2022. EQUITY AFFILIATES In 2022  the share of net profit from equity affiliates was €8.6 million  a decrease of €40.0 million mainly due to an impairment charge on our investment in Clear Media reflecting the historically low level of activity due to mobility restrictions in this geography. NET INCOME GROUP SHARE In 2022  net income Group share turned positive as it increased by €146.7 million to €132.1 million compared to -€14.5 million in 2021  which mainly came from the improvement in our operational performance  the net positive impact from the accounting revaluation of our stake in Interstate JCDecaux being partly offset by the net negative impact of the impairment charges over the period. ADJUSTED CAPITAL EXPENDITURE In 2022  adjusted net capex (acquisition of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets  net of disposals of assets) at €349.9 million increased by €192.4 million  +68.2% year-on-year  mainly driven by the pick-up in tenders in 2022 following Covid delays including €84.9 million of payment for advertising rights related to the renewal and extension of our long-term partnership with Shanghai Metro. Excluding this specific payment  the capex to sales ratio amounted to 8% consistent with the average ratio over the last 10 years. ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW (4) In 2022  operating cash flows reached +€399.4 million improving by +€161.8 million compared to 2021 mainly driven by the improving operating margin. Changes in our working capital had almost no impact on the cash-flow generation during the period (-€6.4 million) despite the strong increase in revenue thanks to an ongoing tight management over cash collection and payments. After capital expenditure  adjusted free cash flow amounted to €43.2 million. DIVIDEND No dividend was paid in 2022 in order to strengthen Group’s liquidity  balance sheet and financial flexibility.To continue to reinforce our capacity to seize future organic and external bolt-on investment opportunities  we will propose at the Annual General Meeting which will take place on May 16th  2023  not to pay any dividend in 2023. NET DEBT (5) Net debt amounted to €975.0 million as of December 31st  2022  a slight increase vs December 31st  2021 where it stood at €924.5 million mainly driven by bolt on M&A activity. In January 2023  we decided to take advantage of the good market conditions to extend our debt maturity schedule and secured our financing profile with the issuance of a €600 million bond with a maturity in 2029 and a coupon at 5.00%. Subscribed more than 2 times and placed with investors of high quality  the success of this new issuance demonstrates both the quality of JCDecaux’s signature and the investors’ confidence in the rebound capacity and in the growth potential of the Group. RIGHT-OF-USE & LEASE LIABILITIES IFRS 16 Right-of-use IFRS 16 as of December 31st  2022 amounted to €2 725.3 million compared to €2 964.8 million as of December 31st  2021  a decrease related to the amortisation of rights-of-use and contracts renegotiations partially offset by foreign exchange rate impacts  perimeter impacts  new contracts  contracts extended and contracts renewed. IFRS 16 lease liabilities decreased from €3 655.8 million as of December 31st  2021 to €3 412 1 million as of December 31st  2022. The decrease  mainly related to repayments occurred in 2022 as well as renegotiations and end of contracts is partially offset by new contracts  extensions and renewals  a positive foreign exchange rates impact and a positive perimeter impact. ADJUSTED DATA Under IFRS 11  applicable from January 1st  2014  companies under joint control are accounted for using the equity method.Under IFRS 16  applicable from January 1st  2019  a lease liability for contractual fixed rental payments is recognised on the balance sheet  against a right-of-use asset to be depreciated over the lease term. As regards P&L  the fixed rent expense is replaced by the depreciation of the right-of-use in EBIT  below the operating margin  and a lease interest expense on the lease liability in financial result  below EBIT. IFRS 16 has no impact on cash payments but payment of debt (principal) is booked in funds from financing activities.However  in order to reflect the business reality of the Group and the readability of our performance  our operating management reports used to monitor the activity  allocate resources and measure performance continue: To integrate on proportional basis operating data of the companies under joint control and;To exclude the IFRS 16 impact on our core business (lease agreements of locations for advertising structures excluding real estate and vehicle rental contracts). As regards the P&L  it concerns all aggregates down to the EBIT. As regards the cash flow statement  it concerns all aggregates down to the free cash flow.Consequently  pursuant to IFRS 8  Segment Reporting presented in the financial statements complies with the Group’s internal information  and the Group’s external financial communication therefore relies on this operating financial information. Financial information and comments are therefore based on “adjusted” data  consistent with historical data  which is reconciled with IFRS financial statements. In 2022  the impacts of IFRS 11 and IFRS 16 on our adjusted aggregates are: -€242.5 million for IFRS 11 on adjusted revenue (-€222.1 million for IFRS 11 in 2021) leaving IFRS revenue at €3 074.0 million (€2 522.5 million in 2021).-€60.6 million for IFRS 11 and €780.2 million for IFRS 16 on adjusted operating margin(-€58.9 million for IFRS 11 and €800.5 million for IFRS 16 in 2021) leaving IFRS operating margin at €1 322.5 million (€1 163.9 million in 2021).(-€58.9 million for IFRS 11 and €800.5 million for IFRS 16 in 2021) leaving IFRS operating margin at €1 322.5 million (€1 163.9 million in 2021). -€45.0 million for IFRS 11 and €114.1 million for IFRS 16 on adjusted EBIT before impairment charge (-€39.5 million for IFRS 11 and €99.5 million for IFRS 16 in 2021) leaving IFRS EBIT before impairment charge at €281.1 million (€76.2 million in 2021).-€43.6 million for IFRS 11 and €114.1 million for IFRS 16 on adjusted EBIT after impairment charge (-€39.5 million for IFRS 11 and €99.5 million for IFRS 16 in 2021) leaving IFRS EBIT after impairment charge at €263.4 million (€68.6 million in 2021).€8.1 million for IFRS 11 on adjusted capital expenditure (€7.2 million for IFRS 11 in 2021) leaving IFRS capital expenditure at -€341.8 million (-€150.3 million in 2021).€12.1 million for IFRS 11 and €702.5 million for IFRS 16 on adjusted free cash flow (-€7.8 million for IFRS 11 and €647.8 million for IFRS 16 in 2021) leaving IFRS free cash flow at €757.8 million (€851.5 million in 2021). The full reconciliation between adjusted figures and IFRS figures is provided on page 8 of this release. NOTES (1) Operating Margin: Revenue less Direct Operating Expenses (excluding Maintenance spare parts) less SG&A expenses.(2) EBIT: Earnings Before Interests and Taxes = Operating Margin less Depreciation  amortization and provisions (net) less Impairment of goodwill less Maintenance spare parts less Other operating income and expenses.(3) Net financial income / (loss): Excluding the net impact of discounting and revaluation of debt on commitments to purchase minority interests (€3.6 million and -€2.1 million in FY 2022 and FY 2021 respectively).(4) Free cash flow: Net cash flow from operating activities less capital investments (property  plant and equipment and intangible assets) net of disposals.(5) Net debt: Debt net of managed cash less bank overdrafts  excluding the non-cash IAS 32 impact (debt on commitments to purchase minority interests)  including the non-cash IFRS 9 impact on both debt and hedging financial derivatives and excluding IFRS 16 lease liabilities.ORGANIC GROWTH DEFINITION The Group’s organic growth corresponds to the adjusted revenue growth excluding foreign exchange impact and perimeter effect. The reference fiscal year remains unchanged regarding the reported figures  and the organic growth is calculated by converting the revenue of the current fiscal year at the average exchange rates of the previous year and taking into account the perimeter variations prorata temporis  but including revenue variations from the gains of new contracts and the losses of contracts previously held in our portfolio. €m Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 FY 2021 adjusted revenue (a) 454.3 628.1 706.5 955.8 2 744.6 2022 IFRS revenue (b) 628.5 739.3 747.5 958.7 3 074.0 IFRS 11 impacts (c) 54.4 52.5 60.9 74.7 242.5 2022 adjusted revenue (d) = (b) + (c) 683.0 791.8 808.4 1 033.3 3 316.5 Currency impacts (e) -20.9 -28.3 -37.8 -26.0 -113.0 2022 adjusted revenue at 2021 exchange rates (f) = (d) + (e) 662.1 763.5 770.6 1 007.3 3 203.5 Change in scope (g) 0.0 0.0 -0.4 -3.0 -3.4 2022 adjusted organic revenue (h) = (f) + (g) 662.1 763.5 770.2 1 004.3 3 200.1 Organic growth (i) = (h) / (a) - 1 +45.7% +21.6% +9.0% +5.1% +16.6%€m Impact of currency as of December 31st  2022 USD -28.7 RMB -18.1 HKD -13.0 BRL -12.3 Other -40.9 Total -113.0Average exchange rate FY 2022 FY 2021 USD 0.9496 0.8455 RMB 0.1413 0.1311 HKD 0.1213 0.1088 BRL 0.1838 0.1568Next information:Q1 2023 revenue: May 11th  2023 (after market) Key Figures for JCDecaux 2022 revenue: €3 317m (a)N°1 Out-of-Home Media company worldwideA daily audience of more than 850 million people in more than 80 countries1 042 132 advertising panels worldwidePresent in 3 573 cities with more than 10 000 inhabitants11 200 employeesJCDecaux is listed on the Eurolist of Euronext Paris and is part of the Euronext 100 and Euronext Family Business indexesJCDecaux is recognised for its extra-financial performance in the FTSE4Good (3.6/5)  CDP (A- Leadership)  MSCI (AA) and has achieved Platinum Medal status from EcoVadis1 st Out-of-Home Media company to join the RE100 (committed to 100% renewable energy)Out-of-Home Media company to join the RE100 (committed to 100% renewable energy) Leader in self-service bike rental scheme: pioneer in eco-friendly mobilityN°1 worldwide in street furniture (603 119 advertising panels)N°1 worldwide in transport advertising with 153 airports and 205 contracts in metros  buses  trains and tramways (330 470 advertising panels)N°1 in Europe for billboards (81 162 advertising panels)N°1 in outdoor advertising in Europe (654 957 advertising panels)N°1 in outdoor advertising in Asia-Pacific (170 973 advertising panels)N°1 in outdoor advertising in Latin America (129 305 advertising panels)N°1 in outdoor advertising in Africa (24 198 advertising panels)N°1 in outdoor advertising in the Middle East (19 371 advertising panels) (a) Adjusted revenue For more information about JCDecaux  please visit jcdecaux.com .Join us on Twitter   Linkedin   Facebook   Instagram and Youtube .

A report with an unqualified opinion is being issued by the Statutory Auditors.Commenting on the 2022 results  Jean-Charles Decaux  Chairman of the Executive Board and Co-CEO of JCDecaux  said:“Our 2022 Group revenue grew by +20.8%  +16.6% on an organic basis  to reach €3 316.5 million driven by a strong digital revenue growth and a continued strong trading momentum. Our organic revenue growth outside China was +24.1% for the full-year 2022.Our Digital Out Of Home (DOOH) revenue grew by +41.1% in full-year 2022  +35.2% on an organic basis  to reach a record 31.4% of Group revenue in 2022  while analogue advertising revenue grew double digit organically in 2022. We maintained our focus on the selective roll-out of digital screens in prime locations  as well as on the development of our data capabilities. Programmatic advertising revenues through the VIOOH SSP (supply-side platform)  which constitute mostly incremental revenue from innovative dynamic data-driven campaigns and new advertisers  doubled in 2022 to reach €61.3 million i.e. 5.9% of our digital revenue in full-year 2022 as the DOOH programmatic ecosystem  including Displayce following our strategic alliance announced in July 2022  continued to gain traction.Our client portfolio remained highly diversified as our top 10 clients represent c.14% of our revenue in 2022. Our number one client category Fashion/Personal care and Luxury Goods made up 17% of total revenue and continued to grow strongly at +41% in 2022. Client categories recovering after Covid came back strongly such as Travel at +54% and Entertainment/Leisure at +31%.With revenue growing by €571.9m in 2022  our adjusted operating margin has reached €602.9m improving by €180.7m  +42.8% year-on-year  18.2% of total revenue in 2022  +280bp vs 2021  reflecting our strong operating leverage despite a historically low level of activity in China due to mobility restrictions. Our net result Group share is back to positive territory at €132.1m an increase by €146.7m year-on-year consistent with the improvement of our operational performance. Our operating cash flows improved by €161.8m to €399.4m and our free-cash-flow reached €43.2m in 2022 as capex increased notably due to a higher contract gains and renewals activity including more than half of the payment for the advertising rights of the 15-year contract with Shanghai Metro. Our net debt increased slightly by €50.5m  mainly driven by bolt-on M&A investments  reaching €975.0m at the end of the period with a financial leverage at 1.6x (vs 2.2x at the end of 2021).Recognized as best in class by extra-financial rating institutions (EcoVadis: Platinum  CDP: A-)  we continued to strengthen our ESG leading initiatives and commitments in 2022 as we have notably unveiled in May 2022 our ambitious 2030 ESG Strategy and we continued to reduce our carbon footprint  which is now at -27% in 2022 vs 2019 (scopes 1  2 and 3). Our highly positive business model financing public services and public transportation contributes to mitigate climate change. Almost 50% of our 2022 revenues are thus eligible and aligned with the European taxonomy. Today we announce our new Climate Strategy  “committed SBTi”  which includes strong proactive commitments to further optimize our carbon footprint such as reducing by 2030  scopes 1 and 2 emissions  by 60%  scope 3 emissions by 46% and reaching Net Zero by 2050 (scopes 1  2 and 3).As far as Q1 2023 is concerned  we now expect an organic revenue growth rate at around +2.5% including a double-digit revenue decline in China where we start seeing an inflection point from March as mobility is returning to normal.As the most digitised global OOH media company  with our new data-led audience targeting and programmatic solutions  our well diversified portfolio  our ability to win new contracts  the strength of our balance sheet  the high quality of our teams across the world and our recognised ESG excellence  we believe we are well positioned to benefit from the rebound. We are more than ever confident in the power of our media in an advertising landscape increasingly fragmented and more and more digital and in the role it will play to drive economic growth as well as positive changes.”Following the adoptions of IFRS 11 from January 1st  2014 and IFRS 16 from January 1st  2019  and in compliance with the AMF’s instructions  the operating data presented below are adjusted:to include our prorata share in companies under joint control  regarding IFRS 11 to exclude the impact of IFRS 16 on our core business lease agreements (lease agreements of locations for advertising structures excluding real estate and vehicle rental contracts).Please refer to the paragraph “Adjusted data” on page 4 of this release for the definition of adjusted data and reconciliation with IFRS.The values shown in the tables are generally expressed in millions of euros. The sum of the rounded amounts or variations calculations may differ  albeit to an insignificant extent  from the reported values.ADJUSTED REVENUEAs reported on January 26th  2023  adjusted revenue increased by +20.8%  +16.6% on an organic basis  to €3 316.5 million compared to €2 744.6 million in 2021.By activity  Transport and Street Furniture rebounded the most followed by Billboard.Full-Yearadjusted revenue 2022 (€m) 2021 (€m) Reported growth Organic growth(a) Street Furniture 1 747.0 1 440.1 +21.3% +18.5% Transport 1 075.2 877.8 +22.5% +15.0% Billboard 494.3 426.7 +15.9% +13.5% Total 3 316.5 2 744.6 +20.8% +16.6%(a) Excluding acquisitions/divestitures and the impact of foreign exchangeAll geographies performed strongly with a double-digit revenue growth in 2022 except Asia-Pacific as China was impacted by historically low mobility levels.Full-Year adjusted revenue 2022 (€m) 2021 (€m) Reported growth Organic growth(a) Europe (b) 988.3 824.5 +19.9% +20.2% Asia-Pacific 721.5 695.9 +3.7% -2.4% France 598.0 532.6 +12.3% +12.1% Rest of the World 416.8 274.9 +51.6% +36.4% United Kingdom 322.5 253.3 +27.4% +26.3% North America 269.3 163.4 +64.8% +45.5% Total 3 316.5 2 744.6 +20.8% +16.6%(a) Excluding acquisitions/divestitures and the impact of foreign exchange(b) Excluding France and the United KingdomADJUSTED OPERATING MARGIN (1)For 2022  our adjusted operating margin has significantly improved by €180.7 million to reach €602.9 million (vs €422.3 million in 2021)  a +42.8% increase year-on-year reflecting a strong operating leverage due to a tight control over our cost base growing at a slower pace than our revenue growth despite the negative impact from the decrease of revenue in China year-on-year. The adjusted operating margin as a percentage of revenue was 18.2% in 2022  +280bp above prior year.The adjusted operating margin as a percentage of revenue by business segment:2022 2021 Change 22/21 €m % of revenue €m % of revenue Change (€m) Margin rate (bp) Street Furniture 417.7 23.9% 323.4 22.5% +94.3 +140bp Transport 118.3 11.0% 58.2 6.6% +60.1 +440bp Billboard 67.0 13.5% 40.7 9.5% +26.3 +400bp Total 602.9 18.2% 422.3 15.4% +180.7 +280bpADJUSTED EBIT (2)In 2022  adjusted EBIT before impairment charge improved by €195.7 million to €212.0 million. As a percentage of revenue  this represented a 580bp increase to 6.4%  from +0.6%. Excluding the positive impact from the accounting revaluation of our stake in Interstate JCDecaux  adjusted EBIT before impairment charge for 2022 reached 5.1% as a percentage of revenue.The net impairment charge on tangible and intangible assets  rights-of-use assets and joint-ventures of €19.1 million in 2022 is mainly related to assets in China reflecting the historically low level of activity due to mobility restrictions in this geography.Adjusted EBIT  after impairment charge  has improved by €184.3 million from €8.7 million in 2021 to €193.0 million in 2022.NET FINANCIAL INCOME / (LOSS) (3)In 2022  interest expenses on IFRS 16 leases were quite stable at -€84.1 million compared to -€82.2 million in 2021  the mechanical reduction of the IFRS 16 lease liability related to the contract life progression being compensated by the additions coming from new contracts  contracts extended and contracts renewed.In 2022  excluding IFRS 16  other net financial income / (loss) was -€55.0 million compared to -€42.8 million in 2021  a variation of -€12.2 million mainly due the impact of currency hedges and the increase in financial interests from the €500 million bond issued in February 2022.EQUITY AFFILIATESIn 2022  the share of net profit from equity affiliates was €8.6 million  a decrease of €40.0 million mainly due to an impairment charge on our investment in Clear Media reflecting the historically low level of activity due to mobility restrictions in this geography.NET INCOME GROUP SHAREIn 2022  net income Group share turned positive as it increased by €146.7 million to €132.1 million compared to -€14.5 million in 2021  which mainly came from the improvement in our operational performance  the net positive impact from the accounting revaluation of our stake in Interstate JCDecaux being partly offset by the net negative impact of the impairment charges over the period.ADJUSTED CAPITAL EXPENDITUREIn 2022  adjusted net capex (acquisition of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets  net of disposals of assets) at €349.9 million increased by €192.4 million  +68.2% year-on-year  mainly driven by the pick-up in tenders in 2022 following Covid delays including €84.9 million of payment for advertising rights related to the renewal and extension of our long-term partnership with Shanghai Metro. Excluding this specific payment  the capex to sales ratio amounted to 8% consistent with the average ratio over the last 10 years.ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW (4)In 2022  operating cash flows reached +€399.4 million improving by +€161.8 million compared to 2021 mainly driven by the improving operating margin. Changes in our working capital had almost no impact on the cash-flow generation during the period (-€6.4 million) despite the strong increase in revenue thanks to an ongoing tight management over cash collection and payments. After capital expenditure  adjusted free cash flow amounted to €43.2 million.DIVIDENDNo dividend was paid in 2022 in order to strengthen Group’s liquidity  balance sheet and financial flexibility.To continue to reinforce our capacity to seize future organic and external bolt-on investment opportunities  we will propose at the Annual General Meeting which will take place on May 16th  2023  not to pay any dividend in 2023.NET DEBT (5)Net debt amounted to €975.0 million as of December 31st  2022  a slight increase vs December 31st  2021 where it stood at €924.5 million mainly driven by bolt on M&A activity.In January 2023  we decided to take advantage of the good market conditions to extend our debt maturity schedule and secured our financing profile with the issuance of a €600 million bond with a maturity in 2029 and a coupon at 5.00%. Subscribed more than 2 times and placed with investors of high quality  the success of this new issuance demonstrates both the quality of JCDecaux’s signature and the investors’ confidence in the rebound capacity and in the growth potential of the Group.RIGHT-OF-USE & LEASE LIABILITIES IFRS 16Right-of-use IFRS 16 as of December 31st  2022 amounted to €2 725.3 million compared to €2 964.8 million as of December 31st  2021  a decrease related to the amortisation of rights-of-use and contracts renegotiations partially offset by foreign exchange rate impacts  perimeter impacts  new contracts  contracts extended and contracts renewed.IFRS 16 lease liabilities decreased from €3 655.8 million as of December 31st  2021 to €3 412 1 million as of December 31st  2022. The decrease  mainly related to repayments occurred in 2022 as well as renegotiations and end of contracts is partially offset by new contracts  extensions and renewals  a positive foreign exchange rates impact and a positive perimeter impact.ADJUSTED DATAUnder IFRS 11  applicable from January 1st  2014  companies under joint control are accounted for using the equity method.Under IFRS 16  applicable from January 1st  2019  a lease liability for contractual fixed rental payments is recognised on the balance sheet  against a right-of-use asset to be depreciated over the lease term. As regards P&L  the fixed rent expense is replaced by the depreciation of the right-of-use in EBIT  below the operating margin  and a lease interest expense on the lease liability in financial result  below EBIT. IFRS 16 has no impact on cash payments but payment of debt (principal) is booked in funds from financing activities.However  in order to reflect the business reality of the Group and the readability of our performance  our operating management reports used to monitor the activity  allocate resources and measure performance continue:To integrate on proportional basis operating data of the companies under joint control and;To exclude the IFRS 16 impact on our core business (lease agreements of locations for advertising structures excluding real estate and vehicle rental contracts).As regards the P&L  it concerns all aggregates down to the EBIT. As regards the cash flow statement  it concerns all aggregates down to the free cash flow.Consequently  pursuant to IFRS 8  Segment Reporting presented in the financial statements complies with the Group’s internal information  and the Group’s external financial communication therefore relies on this operating financial information.

The reference fiscal year remains unchanged regarding the reported figures  and the organic growth is calculated by converting the revenue of the current fiscal year at the average exchange rates of the previous year and taking into account the perimeter variations prorata temporis  but including revenue variations from the gains of new contracts and the losses of contracts previously held in our portfolio.€m Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 FY 2021 adjusted revenue (a) 454.3 628.1 706.5 955.8 2 744.6 2022 IFRS revenue (b) 628.5 739.3 747.5 958.7 3 074.0 IFRS 11 impacts (c) 54.4 52.5 60.9 74.7 242.5 2022 adjusted revenue (d) = (b) + (c) 683.0 791.8 808.4 1 033.3 3 316.5 Currency impacts (e) -20.9 -28.3 -37.8 -26.0 -113.0 2022 adjusted revenue at 2021 exchange rates (f) = (d) + (e) 662.1 763.5 770.6 1 007.3 3 203.5 Change in scope (g) 0.0 0.0 -0.4 -3.0 -3.4 2022 adjusted organic revenue (h) = (f) + (g) 662.1 763.5 770.2 1 004.3 3 200.1 Organic growth (i) = (h) / (a) -

A report with an unqualified opinion is being issued by the Statutory Auditors. Commenting on the 2022 results  Jean-Charles Decaux  Chairman of the Executive Board and Co-CEO of JCDecaux  said: “Our 2022 Group revenue grew by +20.8%  +16.6% on an organic basis  to reach €3 316.5 million driven by a strong digital revenue growth and a continued strong trading momentum. Our organic revenue growth outside China was +24.1% for the full-year 2022. Our Digital Out Of Home (DOOH) revenue grew by +41.1% in full-year 2022  +35.2% on an organic basis  to reach a record 31.4% of Group revenue in 2022  while analogue advertising revenue grew double digit organically in 2022. We maintained our focus on the selective roll-out of digital screens in prime locations  as well as on the development of our data capabilities. Programmatic advertising revenues through the VIOOH SSP (supply-side platform)  which constitute mostly incremental revenue from innovative dynamic data-driven campaigns and new advertisers  doubled in 2022 to reach €61.3 million i.e. 5.9% of our digital revenue in full-year 2022 as the DOOH programmatic ecosystem  including Displayce following our strategic alliance announced in July 2022  continued to gain traction. Our client portfolio remained highly diversified as our top 10 clients represent c.14% of our revenue in 2022. Our number one client category Fashion/Personal care and Luxury Goods made up 17% of total revenue and continued to grow strongly at +41% in 2022. Client categories recovering after Covid came back strongly such as Travel at +54% and Entertainment/Leisure at +31%. With revenue growing by €571.9m in 2022  our adjusted operating margin has reached €602.9m improving by €180.7m  +42.8% year-on-year  18.2% of total revenue in 2022  +280bp vs 2021  reflecting our strong operating leverage despite a historically low level of activity in China due to mobility restrictions. Our net result Group share is back to positive territory at €132.1m an increase by €146.7m year-on-year consistent with the improvement of our operational performance. Our operating cash flows improved by €161.8m to €399.4m and our free-cash-flow reached €43.2m in 2022 as capex increased notably due to a higher contract gains and renewals activity including more than half of the payment for the advertising rights of the 15-year contract with Shanghai Metro. Our net debt increased slightly by €50.5m  mainly driven by bolt-on M&A investments  reaching €975.0m at the end of the period with a financial leverage at 1.6x (vs 2.2x at the end of 2021). Recognized as best in class by extra-financial rating institutions (EcoVadis: Platinum  CDP: A-)  we continued to strengthen our ESG leading initiatives and commitments in 2022 as we have notably unveiled in May 2022 our ambitious 2030 ESG Strategy and we continued to reduce our carbon footprint  which is now at -27% in 2022 vs 2019 (scopes 1  2 and 3). Our highly positive business model financing public services and public transportation contributes to mitigate climate change. Almost 50% of our 2022 revenues are thus eligible and aligned with the European taxonomy. Today we announce our new Climate Strategy  “committed SBTi”  which includes strong proactive commitments to further optimize our carbon footprint such as reducing by 2030  scopes 1 and 2 emissions  by 60%  scope 3 emissions by 46% and reaching Net Zero by 2050 (scopes 1  2 and 3). As far as Q1 2023 is concerned  we now expect an organic revenue growth rate at around +2.5% including a double-digit revenue decline in China where we start seeing an inflection point from March as mobility is returning to normal. As the most digitised global OOH media company  with our new data-led audience targeting and programmatic solutions  our well diversified portfolio  our ability to win new contracts  the strength of our balance sheet  the high quality of our teams across the world and our recognised ESG excellence  we believe we are well positioned to benefit from the rebound. We are more than ever confident in the power of our media in an advertising landscape increasingly fragmented and more and more digital and in the role it will play to drive economic growth as well as positive changes.” Following the adoptions of IFRS 11 from January 1st  2014 and IFRS 16 from January 1st  2019  and in compliance with the AMF’s instructions  the operating data presented below are adjusted: to include our prorata share in companies under joint control  regarding IFRS 11 to exclude the impact of IFRS 16 on our core business lease agreements (lease agreements of locations for advertising structures excluding real estate and vehicle rental contracts). Please refer to the paragraph “Adjusted data” on page 4 of this release for the definition of adjusted data and reconciliation with IFRS.The values shown in the tables are generally expressed in millions of euros. The sum of the rounded amounts or variations calculations may differ  albeit to an insignificant extent  from the reported values. ADJUSTED REVENUE As reported on January 26th  2023  adjusted revenue increased by +20.8%  +16.6% on an organic basis  to €3 316.5 million compared to €2 744.6 million in 2021.

The adjusted operating margin as a percentage of revenue was 18.2% in 2022  +280bp above prior year. The adjusted operating margin as a percentage of revenue by business segment: 2022 2021 Change 22/21 €m % of revenue €m % of revenue Change (€m) Margin rate (bp) Street Furniture 417.7 23.9% 323.4 22.5% +94.3 +140bp Transport 118.3 11.0% 58.2 6.6% +60.1 +440bp Billboard 67.0 13.5% 40.7 9.5% +26.3 +400bp Total 602.9 18.2% 422.3 15.4% +180.7 +280bp ADJUSTED EBIT (2) In 2022  adjusted EBIT before impairment charge improved by €195.7 million to €212.0 million. As a percentage of revenue  this represented a 580bp increase to 6.4%  from +0.6%. Excluding the positive impact from the accounting revaluation of our stake in Interstate JCDecaux  adjusted EBIT before impairment charge for 2022 reached 5.1% as a percentage of revenue. The net impairment charge on tangible and intangible assets  rights-of-use assets and joint-ventures of €19.1 million in 2022 is mainly related to assets in China reflecting the historically low level of activity due to mobility restrictions in this geography. Adjusted EBIT  after impairment charge  has improved by €184.3 million from €8.7 million in 2021 to €193.0 million in 2022. NET FINANCIAL INCOME / (LOSS) (3) In 2022  interest expenses on IFRS 16 leases were quite stable at -€84.1 million compared to -€82.2 million in 2021  the mechanical reduction of the IFRS 16 lease liability related to the contract life progression being compensated by the additions coming from new contracts  contracts extended and contracts renewed. In 2022  excluding IFRS 16  other net financial income / (loss) was -€55.0 million compared to -€42.8 million in 2021  a variation of -€12.2 million mainly due the impact of currency hedges and the increase in financial interests from the €500 million bond issued in February 2022. EQUITY AFFILIATES In 2022  the share of net profit from equity affiliates was €8.6 million  a decrease of €40.0 million mainly due to an impairment charge on our investment in Clear Media reflecting the historically low level of activity due to mobility restrictions in this geography. NET INCOME GROUP SHARE In 2022  net income Group share turned positive as it increased by €146.7 million to €132.1 million compared to -€14.5 million in 2021  which mainly came from the improvement in our operational performance  the net positive impact from the accounting revaluation of our stake in Interstate JCDecaux being partly offset by the net negative impact of the impairment charges over the period. ADJUSTED CAPITAL EXPENDITURE In 2022  adjusted net capex (acquisition of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets  net of disposals of assets) at €349.9 million increased by €192.4 million  +68.2% year-on-year  mainly driven by the pick-up in tenders in 2022 following Covid delays including €84.9 million of payment for advertising rights related to the renewal and extension of our long-term partnership with Shanghai Metro. Excluding this specific payment  the capex to sales ratio amounted to 8% consistent with the average ratio over the last 10 years. ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW (4) In 2022  operating cash flows reached +€399.4 million improving by +€161.8 million compared to 2021 mainly driven by the improving operating margin. Changes in our working capital had almost no impact on the cash-flow generation during the period (-€6.4 million) despite the strong increase in revenue thanks to an ongoing tight management over cash collection and payments. After capital expenditure  adjusted free cash flow amounted to €43.2 million. DIVIDEND No dividend was paid in 2022 in order to strengthen Group’s liquidity  balance sheet and financial flexibility.To continue to reinforce our capacity to seize future organic and external bolt-on investment opportunities  we will propose at the Annual General Meeting which will take place on May 16th  2023  not to pay any dividend in 2023. NET DEBT (5) Net debt amounted to €975.0 million as of December 31st  2022  a slight increase vs December 31st  2021 where it stood at €924.5 million mainly driven by bolt on M&A activity. In January 2023  we decided to take advantage of the good market conditions to extend our debt maturity schedule and secured our financing profile with the issuance of a €600 million bond with a maturity in 2029 and a coupon at 5.00%. Subscribed more than 2 times and placed with investors of high quality  the success of this new issuance demonstrates both the quality of JCDecaux’s signature and the investors’ confidence in the rebound capacity and in the growth potential of the Group. RIGHT-OF-USE & LEASE LIABILITIES IFRS 16 Right-of-use IFRS 16 as of December 31st  2022 amounted to €2 725.3 million compared to €2 964.8 million as of December 31st  2021  a decrease related to the amortisation of rights-of-use and contracts renegotiations partially offset by foreign exchange rate impacts  perimeter impacts  new contracts  contracts extended and contracts renewed. IFRS 16 lease liabilities decreased from €3 655.8 million as of December 31st  2021 to €3 412 1 million as of December 31st  2022. The decrease  mainly related to repayments occurred in 2022 as well as renegotiations and end of contracts is partially offset by new contracts  extensions and renewals  a positive foreign exchange rates impact and a positive perimeter impact. ADJUSTED DATA Under IFRS 11  applicable from January 1st  2014  companies under joint control are accounted for using the equity method.Under IFRS 16  applicable from January 1st  2019  a lease liability for contractual fixed rental payments is recognised on the balance sheet  against a right-of-use asset to be depreciated over the lease term. As regards P&L  the fixed rent expense is replaced by the depreciation of the right-of-use in EBIT  below the operating margin  and a lease interest expense on the lease liability in financial result  below EBIT. IFRS 16 has no impact on cash payments but payment of debt (principal) is booked in funds from financing activities.However  in order to reflect the business reality of the Group and the readability of our performance  our operating management reports used to monitor the activity  allocate resources and measure performance continue: To integrate on proportional basis operating data of the companies under joint control and;To exclude the IFRS 16 impact on our core business (lease agreements of locations for advertising structures excluding real estate and vehicle rental contracts). As regards the P&L  it concerns all aggregates down to the EBIT. As regards the cash flow statement  it concerns all aggregates down to the free cash flow.Consequently  pursuant to IFRS 8  Segment Reporting presented in the financial statements complies with the Group’s internal information  and the Group’s external financial communication therefore relies on this operating financial information. Financial information and comments are therefore based on “adjusted” data  consistent with historical data  which is reconciled with IFRS financial statements. In 2022  the impacts of IFRS 11 and IFRS 16 on our adjusted aggregates are: -€242.5 million for IFRS 11 on adjusted revenue (-€222.1 million for IFRS 11 in 2021) leaving IFRS revenue at €3 074.0 million (€2 522.5 million in 2021).-€60.6 million for IFRS 11 and €780.2 million for IFRS 16 on adjusted operating margin(-€58.9 million for IFRS 11 and €800.5 million for IFRS 16 in 2021) leaving IFRS operating margin at €1 322.5 million (€1 163.9 million in 2021).(-€58.9 million for IFRS 11 and €800.5 million for IFRS 16 in 2021) leaving IFRS operating margin at €1 322.5 million (€1 163.9 million in 2021). -€45.0 million for IFRS 11 and €114.1 million for IFRS 16 on adjusted EBIT before impairment charge (-€39.5 million for IFRS 11 and €99.5 million for IFRS 16 in 2021) leaving IFRS EBIT before impairment charge at €281.1 million (€76.2 million in 2021).-€43.6 million for IFRS 11 and €114.1 million for IFRS 16 on adjusted EBIT after impairment charge (-€39.5 million for IFRS 11 and €99.5 million for IFRS 16 in 2021) leaving IFRS EBIT after impairment charge at €263.4 million (€68.6 million in 2021).€8.1 million for IFRS 11 on adjusted capital expenditure (€7.2 million for IFRS 11 in 2021) leaving IFRS capital expenditure at -€341.8 million (-€150.3 million in 2021).€12.1 million for IFRS 11 and €702.5 million for IFRS 16 on adjusted free cash flow (-€7.8 million for IFRS 11 and €647.8 million for IFRS 16 in 2021) leaving IFRS free cash flow at €757.8 million (€851.5 million in 2021). The full reconciliation between adjusted figures and IFRS figures is provided on page 8 of this release. NOTES (1) Operating Margin: Revenue less Direct Operating Expenses (excluding Maintenance spare parts) less SG&A expenses.(2) EBIT: Earnings Before Interests and Taxes = Operating Margin less Depreciation  amortization and provisions (net) less Impairment of goodwill less Maintenance spare parts less Other operating income and expenses.(3) Net financial income / (loss): Excluding the net impact of discounting and revaluation of debt on commitments to purchase minority interests (€3.6 million and -€2.1 million in FY 2022 and FY 2021 respectively).(4) Free cash flow: Net cash flow from operating activities less capital investments (property  plant and equipment and intangible assets) net of disposals.(5) Net debt: Debt net of managed cash less bank overdrafts  excluding the non-cash IAS 32 impact (debt on commitments to purchase minority interests)  including the non-cash IFRS 9 impact on both debt and hedging financial derivatives and excluding IFRS 16 lease liabilities.ORGANIC GROWTH DEFINITION The Group’s organic growth corresponds to the adjusted revenue growth excluding foreign exchange impact and perimeter effect. The reference fiscal year remains unchanged regarding the reported figures  and the organic growth is calculated by converting the revenue of the current fiscal year at the average exchange rates of the previous year and taking into account the perimeter variations prorata temporis  but including revenue variations from the gains of new contracts and the losses of contracts previously held in our portfolio. €m Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 FY 2021 adjusted revenue (a) 454.3 628.1 706.5 955.8 2 744.6 2022 IFRS revenue (b) 628.5 739.3 747.5 958.7 3 074.0 IFRS 11 impacts (c) 54.4 52.5 60.9 74.7 242.5 2022 adjusted revenue (d) = (b) + (c) 683.0 791.8 808.4 1 033.3 3 316.5 Currency impacts (e) -20.9 -28.3 -37.8 -26.0 -113.0 2022 adjusted revenue at 2021 exchange rates (f) = (d) + (e) 662.1 763.5 770.6 1 007.3 3 203.5 Change in scope (g) 0.0 0.0 -0.4 -3.0 -3.4 2022 adjusted organic revenue (h) = (f) + (g) 662.1 763.5 770.2 1 004.3 3 200.1 Organic growth (i) = (h) / (a) - 1 +45.7% +21.6% +9.0% +5.1% +16.6%€m Impact of currency as of December 31st  2022 USD -28.7 RMB -18.1 HKD -13.0 BRL -12.3 Other -40.9 Total -113.0Average exchange rate FY 2022 FY 2021 USD 0.9496 0.8455 RMB 0.1413 0.1311 HKD 0.1213 0.1088 BRL 0.1838 0.1568Next information:Q1 2023 revenue: May 11th  2023 (after market) Key Figures for JCDecaux 2022 revenue: €3 317m (a)N°1 Out-of-Home Media company worldwideA daily audience of more than 850 million people in more than 80 countries1 042 132 advertising panels worldwidePresent in 3 573 cities with more than 10 000 inhabitants11 200 employeesJCDecaux is listed on the Eurolist of Euronext Paris and is part of the Euronext 100 and Euronext Family Business indexesJCDecaux is recognised for its extra-financial performance in the FTSE4Good (3.6/5)  CDP (A- Leadership)  MSCI (AA) and has achieved Platinum Medal status from EcoVadis1 st Out-of-Home Media company to join the RE100 (committed to 100% renewable energy)Out-of-Home Media company to join the RE100 (committed to 100% renewable energy) Leader in self-service bike rental scheme: pioneer in eco-friendly mobilityN°1 worldwide in street furniture (603 119 advertising panels)N°1 worldwide in transport advertising with 153 airports and 205 contracts in metros  buses  trains and tramways (330 470 advertising panels)N°1 in Europe for billboards (81 162 advertising panels)N°1 in outdoor advertising in Europe (654 957 advertising panels)N°1 in outdoor advertising in Asia-Pacific (170 973 advertising panels)N°1 in outdoor advertising in Latin America (129 305 advertising panels)N°1 in outdoor advertising in Africa (24 198 advertising panels)N°1 in outdoor advertising in the Middle East (19 371 advertising panels) (a) Adjusted revenue For more information about JCDecaux  please visit jcdecaux.com .Join us on Twitter   Linkedin   Facebook   Instagram and Youtube .

An explanation of these measures together with other abbreviated terms is provided at note 9 on page 25 of the Condensed Financial Statements.Revenue increased by €250.4 million (74.9%) to €584.9 million.EBITDA increase of €74.9 million to €127.2 million principally due to increased revenues and a continued focus on costs.The Ferries Division’s Dover – Calais service was further expanded by the introduction the Isle of Inisheer to the route on 26 April 2022. The introduction of the third vessel is the culmination of our planned investment for the route. This has made Irish Ferries a genuine alternative for all customers on the Channel route  with Irish Ferries now offering up to 30 sailings per day on the Dover – Calais route.The fleet was also increased with the acquisition of a container vessel  the CT Pachuca  bringing the total owned fleet to six ferries and eight container ships.The Group commenced operations at a container depot at the new Dublin Inland Port in January 2022 following an earlier public tender. This is an important facility for the Group as we look to expand our container operations in Dublin in the knowledge of the scarcity of space to expand in the core Dublin Port area.During 2022  the Group took delivery of a further five remote control semi-automated electric rubber-tyred gantry cranes (RTGs)  which brings the total number of electrically powered units at DFT to nine. Of the nine RTG’s  six are fully commissioned and in use  with a further three to be commissioned in Q2 of 2023  continuing our transition to this more environmentally efficient mode of operation. The Group has also ordered one new electrically powered ship-to-shore crane (STS) for delivery in 2023. The equipment replacement programme puts us on track to achieve emissions reduction targets of net zero emissions by 2030 in our terminal operations.The Group had strong cash generation during the year with cash generated from operations of €132.0 million (2021 €67.0 million). Cash outflows included strategic capital expenditure of €57.4 million (2021: €41.7 million)  share buybacks of €49.2 million (2021: €19.8 million) and dividends paid of €24.2 million (2021: €nil). Net debt at year end was €171.1 million (€128.7 million pre-IFRS 16) which was 1.2 times EBITDA under banking covenant definitions. The Group is in a strong financial position with available liquidity comprising cash and committed bank facilities of €67.4 million at 31 December 2022.Story continuesCommenting on the results  Chairman John B. McGuckian said;“2022 has been a year not just of recovery but of building for long-term growth. With the Covid-19 pandemic now behind us  we have turned our full attention to maximising the opportunities that have arisen for the Group over the last two years. We come out of the pandemic with operations larger than we had at its commencement  and with a balance sheet that remains strong. 2022 saw the completion of our planned fleet investment for the Dover – Calais route. The entry to this route has been a long-term objective for the Group and the expansion to a three ship operation during 2022 allows us to compete effectively on this route. While there is some uncertainty around economic growth rates  we look forward to continued growth during 2023 through the leveraging of our recent investments and the continued support of all customers.”9 March 2023Enquiries: Eamonn Rothwell  Chief Executive Officer Tel: +353 1 607 5628 Email: info@icg.ie David Ledwidge  Chief Financial Officer Tel: +353 1 607 5628 Email: info@icg.ie Media enquiries: Q4 Public Relations Tel: +353 1 475 1444 Email: press@q4pr.ieResultsFinancial Highlights 2022 2021 Change Revenue €584.9m €334.5m +74.9% EBITDA €127.2m €52.3m +143.2% Operating profit / (loss) €66.7m €(0.2)mThe overall financial outcome for the Group was a profit before tax of €62.5 million (2021: loss of €4.1 million) while operating profit was €66.7 million (2021: loss of €0.2 million). EBITDA generated was €127.2 million (2021: €52.3 million) from total revenues of €584.9 million (2021: €334.5 million).EBITDA increased significantly on the prior year in our Ferries Division where EBITDA was €95.7 million (2021: €23.2 million). The division saw increased revenues from the easing of travel restrictions and expansion of the Dover – Calais service which was offset by an increase in costs  driven primarily by higher fuel prices and increased activity. Performance in our Container and Terminal Division improved with an increased EBITDA of €31.5 million (2021: €29.1 million) through a continued focus on cost optimisation and increases in revenue.As in the prior year  when the Group also faced challenging trading conditions  our diversified revenue streams and cost containment measures protected our strong balance sheet. Cash generated from operations amounted to €132.0 million (2021: €67.0 million) and together with loan drawdowns  this funded strategic capital expenditure of €57.4 million  share buybacks of €49.2 million and dividends of €24.2 million. Net debt at 31 December 2022 stood at €171.1 million (2021: €142.2 million). It is testament to the strength of the business and the balance sheet that  despite challenging trading conditions  we had the ability to continue investing in the future growth of our business.Operational ReviewICG operates through two divisions; the Ferries Division and the Container and Terminal Division. The Ferries Division  which owns and manages the Group’s fleet  operates under the Irish Ferries brand  offering passenger and RoRo freight services. The division is also engaged in ship chartering activities with vessels chartered within the Group and to third parties. The Container and Terminal Division includes the intermodal shipping line Eucon as well as the division’s strategically located container terminals in Dublin and its terminal operations in Belfast.Ferries DivisionFinancial summary 2022 2021 Change Revenue* €399.9m €175.5m +127.9% EBITDA €95.7m €23.2m +312.5% Operating profit / (loss) €46.4m €(17.4)m*Includes inter-segment revenue of €35.3 million (2021: €13.8 million)Operational Highlights 2022 2021 Change Volumes ‘000 ‘000 Cars 573.4 203.6 +181.6% Passengers 2 315.0 667.8 +246.7% RoRo freight units 696.6 290.0 +140.2%Revenue in the division was 127.9% higher than the previous year at €399.9 million (2021: €175.5 million). Revenue in the first half of the year increased by 166.9% to €167.9 million (2021: €62.9 million)  while in the second half revenue increased by 106.0%  to €232.0 million (2021: €112.6 million). EBITDA increased to €95.7 million (2021: €23.2 million) while operating profit was €46.4 million compared with a loss of €(17.4) million in 2021.Fuel costs were €104.6 million  an increase of €61.5 million on the prior year. The division achieved a return on capital employed of 14.9% (2021: (5.9%)). In total  Irish Ferries operated 13 865 sailings in 2022 (2021: 6 331)  the increase due to additional sailings on the Irish Ferries Dover – Calais service  commenced in June 2021  as it moved to a three vessel operation during 2022.Car and Passenger marketsIt is estimated that the overall car market  on the routes that we operate (Republic of Ireland to UK/France and the Dover Straits)  grew by approximately 147.2% in 2022 to 4 131 000 cars. While encouraging  this level of car carryings is still 23.9% behind 2019 levels.Irish Ferries’ car carryings during the year were increased over the previous year by 181.6% to 573 400 cars (2021: 203 600 cars). The increase in carryings versus 2021 levels is primarily due to the lifting of Covid-19 travel restrictions and the expansion to a three ship service on the Dover – Calais route.The total sea passenger market (i.e. comprising car  coach and foot passengers on the Republic of Ireland to UK/France and the Dover Straits) increased by 95.5% on 2021 to a total of 16.6 million passengers. Irish Ferries’ passenger numbers carried increased by 246.7% at 2 315 000 (2021: 667 800)..RoRo FreightThe RoRo freight market between the Republic of Ireland to the UK and France and the Dover Straits fell slightly in 2022. The total number of trucks and trailers decreased by 1.1%  to approximately 4 389 700 units.Irish Ferries’ freight carryings  at 696 600 freight units (2021: 290 000 freight units)  increased by 140.2% versus the prior year. The increased carryings over market performance was enabled through the additional capacity of the three vessel service on the Dover – Calais route.CharteringThe Group continued to charter a number of vessels to third parties during 2022. Overall external charter revenues were €17.2 million in 2022 (2021: €8.1 million). Of our eight owned LoLo container vessels  five are currently on charter to the Group’s container shipping subsidiary Eucon on routes between Ireland and the Continent whilst three are chartered to third parties.

The revenue is derived from container handling and related ancillary revenues at our terminals and in Eucon from a mix of domestic door-to-door  quay-to-quay and feeder services with 74% (2021: 72%) of shipping revenue generated from imports into Ireland. With a flexible chartered fleet and slot charter arrangements  Eucon was able to adjust capacity and thereby continue to meet the requirements of customers in a cost effective and efficient manner.EBITDA in the division increased by 8.2% to €31.5 million (2021: €29.1 million) while operating profit grew 18.0% to €20.3 million (2021: €17.2 million). The division achieved a return on capital employed of 29.3% (2021: 25.5%).In Eucon  overall container volumes shipped were down 6.9% compared with the previous year at 322 600 teu (2021: 346 600 teu). Despite the reduction in volumes in Eucon and strong increases in the cost base  revenue and profitability increased due to recovery from our customers by increasing rates and the continued application of the flexible bunker and fuel surcharges.Containers handled at the Group’s terminals in Dublin Ferryport Terminals (DFT) and Belfast Container Terminal (BCT) were down 4.7% at 319 600 lifts (2021: 335 500 lifts). DFT’s volumes were down 4.5%  while BCT’s volumes were down 5.1%. While the reduction in volumes is disappointing  we are encouraged by the continued Revenue growth in the terminals offsetting the additional costs.Group Finance ReviewCash FlowA summary cash flow is presented below:2022 2021 €m €m Operating profit / (loss) (EBIT)* 66.7 (0.2) Depreciation and amortisation 60.5 52.5 EBITDA* 127.2 52.3 Working capital movements 1.2 11.7 Retirement benefit scheme movements 1.1 0.6 Share-based payment expense 3.0 1.3 Other movements (0.5) 1.1 Cash generated from operations 132.0 67.0 Interest paid (4.0) (8.4) Tax paid (1.7) (0.8) Capital expenditure excluding strategic capital expenditure (18.3) (13.5) Free cash flow before strategic capital expenditure* 108.0 44.3 Strategic capital expenditure (57.4) (41.7) Free cash flow after strategic capital expenditure 50.6 2.6 Proceeds on disposal of property  plant and equipment 3.0 2.8 Share issue 0.1 0.7 Settlement of employee equity plans through market purchases (2.9) (1.0) Dividends paid (24.2) - Share buyback (49.2) (19.8) Net cash flows (22.6) (14.7)*Additional information in relation to these Alternative Performance Measures (“APMs”) is disclosed on page 25.EBITDA for the year was €127.2 million (2021: €52.3 million). There was a net inflow of €1.2 million due to positive working capital movements  retirement benefit scheme movements of €1.1 million  share-based payment expense of €3.0 million and other net cash outflows amounting to €0.5 million  yielding cash generated from operations amounting to €132.0 million (2021: €67.0 million).Interest paid was €4.0 million (2021: €8.4 million) while taxation paid was €1.7 million (2021: €0.8 million).Capital expenditure outflows amounted to €75.7 million (2021: €55.2 million) which included €57.4 million of strategic capital expenditure. Strategic capital expenditure included the purchase of an eighth container vessel (the CT Pachuca)  the purchase of the Isle of Inisheer and RTG’s for Dublin Ferryport Terminal.There was €24.2 million (2021: €nil) of dividends paid during the year. There was €49.2 million (2021: €19.8 million) expended in buying back the Group’s equity.The above cash flows resulted in a year-end net debt of €171.1 million (2021: €142.2 million)  which comprised gross borrowings of €167.7 million (2021: €123.1 million)  lease obligations of €42.4 million (2021: €57.6 million) offset by cash balances of €39.0 million (2021: €38.5 million). The key net debt / EBITDA ratio was 1.2 times (2021: 2.6 times) under banking covenant definitions (see Appendix for further information).Balance SheetA summary balance sheet is presented below:2022 2021 €m €m Property  plant & equipment and intangible assets 364.2 330.1 Right-of-use assets 41.4 57.2 Long term receivable 10.5 13.6 Retirement benefit surplus 33.6 6.7 Other assets 85.2 65.8 Cash and bank balances 39.0 38.5 Total assets 573.9 511.9 Non-current borrowings 160.4 115.8 Non-current lease liabilities 30.7 37.5 Retirement benefit obligations 0.4 1.4 Other non-current liabilities 4.7 1.5 Current borrowings 7.3 7.3 Current lease liabilities 11.7 20.1 Other current liabilities 97.9 78.6 Total liabilities 313.1 262.2 Total equity 260.8 249.7 Total equity and liabilities 573.9 511.9The total net surplus of all defined benefit pension schemes at 31 December 2022 was €33.2 million in comparison to a €5.3 million surplus at 31 December 2021. The movement principally reflects a net actuarial gain of €29.4 million comprising a fall in asset values reflective of the investment market and a reduction in obligations due to higher discount rates. Movement in property  plant and equipment mainly relates to the acquisition of new vessels  partially offset by depreciation. The increase in other assets relates primarily to increased trade receivables. The movement in non-current borrowings principally relates to the drawdown during 2022 of €52.0 million worth of loans  offset by €7.6 million worth of scheduled repayments.Shareholders’ equity increased to €260.8 million from €249.7 million at 31 December 2021. The movement includes the profit for the financial period of €59.8 million  actuarial gains arising on retirement benefit schemes of €29.4 million  dividends paid of €24.2 million and buyback of equity of €49.2 million.FinancingThe borrowing facilities available to the Group at 31 December 2022 were as follows;Borrowing Facilities Facility Committed Committedfacilitiesdrawn Committed facilities undrawn €m €m €m €m Private placement loan notes 258.0 50.0 50.0 - Bank term loans 56.2 56.2 56.2 - Revolving credit 125.0 75.0 62.0 13.0 Overdraft and other 16.0 16.0 0.6 15.4 455.2 197.2 168.8 28.4At 31 December 2022  the Group had total lending facilities of €455.2 million available of which €197.2 million were committed facilities. Of these  €168.8 million have been utilised  of which €7.3 million are classified as repayable within one year. The interest rates on all Group borrowings at 31 December 2022  comprising loan notes and term loans  has been fixed at contracted rates at the date of drawdown with the relevant lender eliminating exposure to interest rate risk on borrowings. The average interest rate on borrowings at 31 December 2022 was 2.40% (2021: 1.60%) for remaining terms of between three months and 7.5 years. In addition to borrowings  the Group has recognised lease liabilities at 31 December 2022 relating to right-of-use assets amounting to €42.4 million.These facilities  together with undrawn committed facilities of €28.4 million and cash generated from operations  will be used to support the long-term strategic development of the Group.Fuel2022 2021 Change Fuel costs €124.0m €55.1m +125.0%Group fuel costs in 2022 amounted to €124.0 million (2021: €55.1 million). Bunker consumption was 161 900 tonnes in 2022 (2021: 129 400 tonnes). The increase in consumption was primarily due to increased sailings on the Dover – Calais service. The average cost per tonne of heavy fuel oil (HFO) fuel in 2022 was 47% higher than in 2021 while marine gas oil (MGO) was 107% higher than in 2021.In the Container and Terminal Division  bunker costs above a base level are offset to a large extent by the application of prearranged price adjustments with our customers. Similar arrangements are in place with freight customers in the Ferries Division. In the passenger sector  changes in bunker costs are included in the ticket price to the extent that market conditions will allow.Dividend and Share BuybackFollowing the easing of travel restrictions and the subsequent increase in our tourism carryings  the Directors declared and paid during 2022 a final dividend of 9.00 cent per ordinary share for 2021 and an interim dividend of 4.64 cent per ordinary share for 2022. Dividends paid during the year totalled €24.2 million. Payment of dividends had been suspended during 2020 and 2021 due to the effects of the Covid-19 travel restrictions on the financial performance of the Group.During the year  the Company bought back a total of 12.0 million shares which were cancelled. The total consideration paid for these shares was €49.2 million (2021: €19.8 million). The Directors are proposing a final dividend in respect of 2022 of 9.45 cent per share subject to shareholder approval at the AGM on 11 May 2023  which will be paid on 9 June 2023 to shareholders on the register at close of business on 19 May 2023.Exit of United Kingdom from the European UnionThe Group remains concerned at the lack of implementation of appropriate checks on goods arriving into Northern Ireland from Britain  which are required under the Northern Ireland Protocol. To the extent that goods are destined for the Republic of Ireland  this is causing a distortion in the level playing field as goods that arrive directly into the Republic of Ireland ports from Britain are being checked on arrival. The Group notes the proposals contained in the recent Windsor Framework  which as yet is not ratified by the UK Government and the EU. We welcome this initiative to introduce appropriate checks on goods moving between Britain and Ireland including movements via ports in Northern Ireland.Strategic DevelopmentsThe Group has continued to progress a number of key strategic developments during the year.In keeping with our progress over the last number of years  we have placed a significant focus on enhancing our approach to ESG and sustainability. We have rolled out a number of further initiatives across the Group and continued initiatives that commenced in prior years  highlights of which include the significant progress we have made in reducing the emissions of our container terminal operations. Continuing our expansion and modernisation programme at Dublin Port  2022 was a year of further material investment in this business. With the investment we have made and continue to make in more environmentally friendly terminal equipment  we are on course to achieve a reduction in the emissions from our container terminal operations of 70 per cent by 2025 over the course of the programme. With the progress made to date and the expected future investment  we expect to achieve our target of net zero emissions in our container terminal operations by 2030. We also continue to develop our environmental reporting processes in co-ordinating the collection of relevant data and considering how best this can be harnessed to affect behaviours in order to drive further improvement. This also provides the basis for increasing transparency over our sustainability credentials. We continue to engage with our stakeholders to understand their key pressing and material issues which we will evaluate and implement in our day to day business when appropriate.We introduced the Isle of Inisheer onto our Dover – Calais service as the third vessel on 26 April 2022. Joining the Isle of Inishmore and the Isle of Innisfree  this service now offers up to 30 sailings per day. Having commenced in June 2021  our service on Dover – Calais offers a genuine alternative for all users of the Channel Route.The Group also purchased a container vessel  the CT Pachuca  during the year. This brings the total number of container vessels owned by the Group to eight and upon delivery the vessel was chartered to Group subsidiary Eucon.During 2022  the Group took delivery of a further five remote control semi-automated electric RTG’s which brings the total number of electrically powered RTG’s at DFT to nine. Of the nine RTG’s  six are fully commissioned and in use with a further three to be commissioned during Q2 2023 continuing our transition to this more environmentally efficient mode of operation. The Group has also ordered one new electrically powered ship-to-shore crane (STS) for delivery in 2023. The deployment of these electric cranes puts us on track to meet our emissions reduction targets of net zero emissions by 2030.Belfast Container Terminal (BCT) operates the sole container terminal at Belfast under a services concession agreement with Belfast Harbour Commissioners (BHC) at a 27 acre site in Belfast Harbour. The £40 million re-investment project by BHC commenced in 2019 and continued into 2022. The project included extensive civil works and the delivery of two new ship-to-shore gantry cranes along with eight new electrically operated RTGs of which five are now in service. A further three RTG’s are scheduled to be commissioned in the second half of 2023. As per the investment in DFT  this investment is essential to reducing emissions in our terminal operations.The Group commenced operations at the new Dublin Inland Port in January 2022  under a 20 year lease agreement awarded following a public tender process. Trading as Dublin Ferryport Inland Depot (DFID)  this facility will be used for the remote storage  maintenance and upgrade of empty container boxes  releasing valuable capacity for the handling of containers in the port area. The Dublin Inland Port is located adjacent to Dublin Airport with direct access to the M50 Motorway (Dublin Ring Road) and Dublin Port via the Port Tunnel.Strategy and the EnvironmentThe Group is conscious that its activities have an environmental impact but is happy to note that reducing that impact aligns with our overall strategy. The Group has continued with the significant investments in installing exhaust gas cleaning systems (EGCS) and the ongoing program of electrification of heavy plant at our container terminals. Both of these investments  while reducing harmful emissions  also bring health and safety benefits to our operatives and align with the strategic objective of delivering sustained and profitable growth. This investment continued in 2022  including the commissioning of two additional electric cranes for our Dublin Ferryport Terminal. Three further electric RTG’s are on site and will be commissioned in 2023.The Group currently collects various data related to its environmental impact of its operations for external reporting purposes. In recognition of the powerful effect that data can have on creating awareness of individual actions  the Group collates and harnesses this data as a tool to promote environmental responsibility within the workforce. While we recognise that there is and always will be additional work to do in this space  we consider the ongoing improvement and progress together with the firm foundation established from prior years will enable the further development of our approach to sustainability  ESG and strong reporting in the years ahead.However  for certain aspects the Group will require the shipping sector as a whole to work together. This particularly relates to global regulation under the auspices of the International Maritime Organisation setting common standards and key equipment suppliers adopting the latest technologies. As a small operator in a global market  the Group will only apply proven technologies and we will recover the costs of same  either by increased efficiencies or by passing associated costs through to customers.The Group is aware that our stakeholders require us to be environmentally focused and the Group is committed to continuous improvement in everything that we do. Freight remains the backbone of the local Irish and European economies. Our efforts in greening the maritime industry is a vital part of moving the wider European economy to a sustainable footing in the face of the rising challenge from climate change.Current Trading and Outlook2023 Trading to date 1/1/23 – 4/3/23 1/1/22 – 4/3/22 Change Volumes ‘000 ‘000 Cars 50.0 35.2 +42.0% RoRo freight units 111.9 92.4 +21.1% Containers shipped (teu) 53.7 56.2 (4.4%) Port lifts 51.9 55.0 (5.6%)We have experienced strong growth in car and RoRo freight volumes in 2022  due partly to the unwinding of Covid-19 restrictions and also due to the expansion of our services on the Dover – Calais route. Container volumes were down slightly as they are more impacted by the slowdown in world growth and international trade volumes.In the period from 1 January 2023 to 4 March 2023  Irish Ferries carried 50 000 cars  an increase of 42.0% over the same period in the prior year. While these increases are encouraging  it is over a seasonally less significant time of the year for passenger travel. We do see an opportunity for material growth in our passenger business with the expected return to pre-pandemic levels.RoRo volumes in the Ferries Division have also started strongly in 2023. Overall  Irish Ferries RoRo volumes are up 21.1% on the same period in the prior year to 111 900 RoRo units. We expect that 2023 sees a continuation of the trend of freight customers returning to the landbridge and we are hopeful that the Windsor Framework will remove the distortion from the non-implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol. We welcome recent calls for the establishment of Green lanes on ferry routes between the UK and the Republic of Ireland  for traffic destined for Northern Ireland. This will ensure freight moves on and off the island of Ireland in the most efficient  timely and environmentally friendly manner.The Container and Terminal Division has seen a reduction in containers shipped in the period from 1 January 2023 to 4 March 2023 of 4.4%. The number of terminal lifts has seen a similar drop of 5.6% in the same period. This is indicative of a slowdown in the global economy and is not unexpected. However  the recent and ongoing investment in capacity expansion for longer term growth and plant modernisation at our container terminals will provide a platform for both growth and more efficient operations at our Dublin terminal. This will be further aided by the operations at our new Dublin Inland Port facility which commenced during 2022.We note the ever-increasing expectations and regulatory requirements to reduce the effects of our operations on the environment. While the Group acknowledges that its operations have an inevitable impact on the environment it does so in the knowledge that it operates essential services from the island of Ireland  which was clearly evident during the worst of the Covid-19 lockdowns. Our maritime transport operations remain the most environmentally sustainable form of transport for facilitating trade and movement of goods and people on and off the island. Nevertheless  reducing our impact on the environment is embedded in the Group’s DNA through maximising the effectiveness and efficiency in our operations while continuing to invest in appropriate technologies to reduce our impact on the environment.While there is some uncertainty around economic growth rates  we look forward to continued growth during 2023 through the leveraging of our recent investments and the continued support of all customers.Condensed Consolidated Income Statementfor the year ended 31 December 2022Notes 2022 2021 €m €m Revenue 2 584.9 334.5 Depreciation and amortisation (60.5) (52.5) Employee benefits expense (26.8) (20.8) Other operating expenses 2 (430.9) (261.4) Operating profit / (loss) 66.7 (0.2) Finance income 0.1 0.1 Finance costs (4.3) (4.0) Profit / (loss) before taxation 62.5 (4.1) Income tax expense 3 (2.7) (0.8) Profit / (loss) for the financial year: all attributable to equity holders of the parent 59.8 (4.9) Earnings per ordinary share– expressed in euro cent per share Basic 4 33.6 (2.6) Diluted 4 33.2 (2.6)Condensed Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Incomefor the year ended 31 December 20222022 2021 Notes €m €m Profit / (loss) for the financial year 59.8 (4.9) Items that may be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss: Currency translation adjustment (2.5) 1.3 Items that will not be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss: Actuarial gain on defined benefit obligations 7 29.4 7.1 Deferred tax on defined benefit pension schemes (2.4)(0.9)Other comprehensive income for the financial year 24.5 7.5 Total comprehensive income for the financial year: all attributable to equity holders of the parent 84.3 2.6Condensed Consolidated Statement of Financial Positionas at 31 December 20222022 2021 Notes €m €m Assets Non-current assets Property  plant and equipment 362.3 328.2 Intangible assets 1.9 1.9 Right-of-use assets 41.4 57.2 Retirement benefit surplus 7 33.6 6.7 Finance lease receivable 10.5 13.6 Deferred tax asset 0.1 0.1 449.8 407.7 Current assets Inventories 5.2 3.8 Trade and other receivables 79.9 61.9 Cash and bank balances 5 39.0 38.5 124.1 104.2 Total assets 573.9 511.9 Equity and liabilities Equity Share capital 11.1 11.9 Share premium 20.5 20.4 Other reserves (8.2) (8.1) Retained earnings 237.4 225.5 Equity attributable to equity holders 260.8 249.7 Non-current liabilities Borrowings 5 160.4 115.8 Lease liabilities 5 30.7 37.5 Deferred tax liabilities 3.6 1.3 Provisions 1.1 0.2 Retirement benefit obligation 7 0.4 1.4 196.2 156.2 Current liabilities Borrowings 5 7.3 7.3 Lease liabilities 5 11.7 20.1 Trade and other payables 96.2 75.5 Provisions 1.7 3.1 116.9 106.0 Total liabilities 313.1 262.2 Total equity and liabilities 573.9 511.9Condensed Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equityfor the year ended 31 December 2022Share Share Other Retained Capital Premium Reserves Earnings Total €m €m €m €m €m Balance at 1 January 2022 11.9 20.4 (8.1) 225.5 249.7 Profit for the financial year -

Segmental informationThe Executive Board is deemed the chief operating decision maker within the Group. For management purposes  the Group is currently organised into two operating segments: Ferries and Container and Terminal.Revenue has been disaggregated into categories which reflect how the nature  amount  timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. As revenues are recognised over short time periods of no more than days  a key determinant to categorising revenues is whether they principally arise from a business to customer or a business to business relationship as this impacts directly on the uncertainty of cash flows.i) Revenue analysisBy business segment:2022 2021 €m €m Ferries Passenger 162.7 59.0 Freight 184.7 94.6 Charter and other 52.5 21.9 399.9 175.5 Container and Terminal Freight 221.5 174.0 Inter-segment revenue (36.5) (15.0) Total 584.9 334.5By geographic origin of booking:2022 2021 €m €m Ireland 202.4 135.6 United Kingdom 142.2 64.1 Netherlands 99.7 73.7 Belgium 47.7 36.7 France 20.2 4.5 Poland 18.8 4.5 Austria 10.8 0.8 Other 43.1 14.6 584.9 334.5No single external customer in the current or prior financial year amounted to 10 per cent of the Group’s revenues.ii) Profit / (loss) for the financial yearFerries Container & Terminal Group Total 2022€m 2021€m 2022€m 2021€m 2022€m 2021€m Operating profit / (loss) 46.4 (17.4) 20.3 17.2 66.7 (0.2) Finance income 0.1 - - 0.1 0.1 0.1 Finance costs (3.1) (2.0) (1.2) (2.0) (4.3) (4.0) Profit / (loss) before tax 43.4 (19.4) 19.1 15.3 62.5 (4.1) Income tax expense (1.3) (0.1) (1.4) (0.7) (2.7) (0.8) Profit / (loss) for the financial year 42.1 (19.5) 17.7 14.6 59.8 (4.9)iii) Other operating expensesFerries Container & Terminal Group Total 2022€m 2021€m 2022€m 2021€m 2022€m 2021€m Fuel 104.6 43.1 19.4 12.0 124.0 55.1 Labour 48.3 28.7 12.6 9.7 60.9 38.4 Port costs 69.0 44.0 35.2 33.7 104.2 77.7 Haulage - - 56.6 50.0 56.6 50.0 Other 61.3 20.7 60.4 34.5 121.7 55.2 Inter-segment (1.2) (1.2) (35.3) (13.8) (36.5) (15.0) Other operating expenses 282.0 135.3 148.9 126.1 430.9 261.4iv) Statement of Financial PositionFerries Container & Terminal Group Total 2022€m 2021€m 2022€m 2021€m 2022€m 2021€m Assets Segment assets 422.5 367.0 112.4 106.4 534.9 473.4 Cash and cash equivalents 34.5 29.9 4.5 8.6 39.0 38.5 Consolidated total assets 457.0 396.9 116.9 115.0 573.9 511.9 Liabilities Segment liabilities 66.7 49.8 36.3 31.7 103.0 81.5 Borrowings and lease liabilities 174.6 140.0 35.5 40.7 210.1 180.7 Consolidated total liabilities 241.3 189.8 71.8 72.4 313.1 262.23.

These forward-looking statements are based on current plans  estimates and beliefs of management. All statements  other than statements of historical facts  are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements  including estimates of revenues  operating margins  capital expenditures  cash  other financial information  expected legal  arbitration  political  regulatory or clinical results or practices and other such estimates and results. By their nature  such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and assumptions which might cause the actual results  financial condition  performance or achievements of UCB  or industry results  to differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Important factors that could result in such differences include: the global spread and impact of COVID-19  changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  will progress to product approval or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products  which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB's efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover  sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment  including pricing pressure  political and public scrutiny  customer and prescriber patterns or practices  and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes. Finally  a breakdown  cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality  integrity and availability of UCB's data and systems.Given these uncertainties  you should not place undue reliance on any of such forward-looking statements. There can be no guarantee that the investigational or approved products described in this press release will be submitted or approved for sale or for any additional indications or labelling in any market  or at any particular time  nor can there be any guarantee that such products will be or will continue to be commercially successful in the future.UCB is providing this information  including forward-looking statements  only as of the date of this press release and it does not reflect any potential impact from the evolving COVID-19 pandemic  unless indicated otherwise. UCB is following the worldwide developments diligently to assess the financial significance of this pandemic to UCB.

IFRS 17 is the first international accou…,The Hague  March 9  2023 - Aegon will today host an educational webinar to outline its implementation of the accounting standards IFRS 17 and IFRS 9  which have become effective on January 1  2023. IFRS 17 is the first international accounting standard for insurance contracts and aims to create more consistency and comparability between companies. While the new accounting standard will impact Aegon’s financial reporting  it will not impact its strategy  capital management approach  financial targets  and outlook.During the webinar  Aegon will explain the choices it has made in implementing IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 and the impact of the new standards on its balance sheet and income statement by using selected key financial information.Reducing earnings volatilityThe new standard more closely aligns the valuation of assets and liabilities  which will reduce the impact from accounting mismatches in the financial results compared with the previous standards. Aegon has made accounting choices in implementing IFRS 17 where possible that allow for alignment of earnings with the relevant local capital frameworks and limit earnings volatility from accounting mismatches.Financial impact of the transition to new accounting standardsIn the IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 opening balance sheet of January 1  2022  Aegon’s shareholders’ equity is expected to decline to around EUR 11.7 billion from around EUR 17.8 billion excluding revaluation reserves under IFRS 4. This reflects the establishment of a contractual service margin (CSM) of EUR 11.8 billion pre-tax. The CSM represents a substantial stock of future value that is expected to be released through the operating result over time and to lead to a higher operating result than under IFRS 4.Further details will be shared during the educational webinar  that will be hosted by Matt Rider  CFO  and Jan Willem Weidema  Head of Investor Relations.

Under the theme “making the difference for people and planet” we give stakeholders an insight into our strategy  business activities and performance over the past year. Our activities are presented in the context of our strategic priorities: providing a superior customer experience and putting sustainability at the heart of what we do.On Sustainability  the report includes enhanced disclosures around our climate ambition and sustainable finance. With our Terra approach  we aim to steer the most carbon-intensive parts of our loan book towards net zero by 2050. In 2022  to promote immediate action towards decarbonisation  we set intermediate 2030 targets for all nine Terra sectors. We also reinforced our commitment to support the energy transition  announcing an aim to grow new commitments in renewable energy production by 50% by the end of 2025  as compared to 2021. Already  renewables comprise around 60% of our power generation portfolio. In 2022  we also announced to end the provision of dedicated upstream finance to new oil and gas fields.We also report on the four areas enabling us to execute our strategy: providing a seamless digital experience  using our scalable Tech and Ops  staying safe and secure and unlocking our people’s full potential. On the latter  the report highlights our commitment to diversity  inclusion and belonging  including an analysis of the gender pay gap. We realise there is more to be done in this area  especially on the underrepresentation of women in leadership positions. We introduced a new target of at least 30% female representation in our senior management by 2025 and 35% in 2028. In 2022  that figure was 29%. The report describes initiatives such as changing how we hire  progress and retain talented women  with a bank-wide action plan introduced in 2022.A major factor in 2022 affecting our company  customers and employees was the war in Ukraine - an immense human tragedy. We decided to do no new business with Russian clients and to get existing exposures repaid as quickly as possible - in effect setting a course for ending our involvement in Russia. Our total Russia-related exposures more than halved from the amount at the end of February 2022. Our global results in connection with these exposures declined sharply as we recognised significant risk costs. This was partly offset by results of our local subsidiary  also driven by interest rate and currency developments. Going forward  we will continue to actively reduce our Russia-related credit exposure.The report features interviews with ING’s chief executive officer Steven van Rijswijk and Hans Wijers  chairman of the Supervisory Board  as well as sections on Risk Management  Corporate Governance and the definitive consolidated and parent company financial statements.

The tender offer  which was initially announced by Tetragon on 3 March 2023  will be conducted as a ""modified Dutch auction"" with shareholders able to tender their Tetragon non-voting shares at prices ranging from and including $9.25 up to and including $11.00 per share. The tender offer is expected to expire at 11:59 p.m. (ET) on 6 April 2023  unless extended or terminated earlier. J.P. Morgan Securities plc (which conducts its U.K. investment banking business as J.P. Morgan Cazenove) will act as dealer manager for the tender offer and Computershare Investor Services PLC will act as tender agent for the tender offer.Eligible shareholders will be able to indicate how many Tetragon non-voting shares and at what price or prices within the specified range they wish to tender. Based on the number of shares tendered and the prices specified by the tendering shareholders  J.P. Morgan  as dealer manager  will determine the lowest price per share within the range that will enable Tetragon to purchase $25 000 000 in value of Tetragon non-voting shares  or a lower amount if the tender offer is not fully subscribed. All shares purchased by Tetragon in the tender offer will be purchased at the same price. If  based on the determined purchase price  more than $25 000 000 in value of shares are properly tendered and not properly withdrawn  valid tenders made below the determined purchase price are expected to be accepted in full  except in the limited circumstances described below  while valid tenders made at the determined purchase price will be subject to proration. However  if the pro rata reduction of the number of shares eligible to be purchased at the determined purchase price is insufficient to reduce the value of the shares to be purchased to $25 000 000  then none of the shares tendered at the determined purchase price will be purchased  and instead there will be a pro rata reduction in the purchase of shares tendered at the next highest price below the determined purchase price to the extent necessary to reduce the value of shares purchased to $25 000 000. The determined purchase price  as well as the proration factor (if applicable)  is expected to be announced on or about 11 April 2023  and Tetragon expects the purchase of shares in the tender offer would be settled promptly thereafter.The tender offer is not conditioned upon the receipt of any minimum number of shares being tendered.This release is for informational purposes only and is neither an offer to buy nor the solicitation of an offer to sell any shares of Tetragon.

The strong partnership with our customers and suppliers is also fundamental for our business performance.The excellent 2022 result is one more milestone in our ambitious strategy that we will continue to deploy. We remain focused on our core business  but will keep investing in other growth opportunities. We keep recruiting new key talents who will contribute to the execution of our medium and long term plans.Looking to 2023  while we are experiencing an improvement in the global supply chain and in the component shortages  we also see signs of broader macro-related inflationary uncertainties that are affecting consumer confidence. This is creating demand uncertainty for the year. We will keep working closely with our customers and suppliers to react quickly to any market events  and to keep delivering on our commitments to them and to our other stakeholders. Considering all this  we are confident of delivering on our guidance for 2023”. I- 2022 Key Highlights & 2023 OutlookIn € million  continuing operations 2022 2021 Change at current rate Change at Constant Rate Revenues 2 776 2 250 23.4% 11.4% Adjusted EBITDA 161 141 14.3% 3.7% As a % of revenues 5.8% 6.3% (46bps) (43 bps) Adjusted EBITA 55 39 39.7% 28.2% Free Cash Flow before Financial & Tax 88 (112) 200 187 2022 Key Hi ghlights The group’s growth has been fueled by higher broadband volumes thanks to the success of our Fiber and Wi Fi 6 offer  price increases to partially recover cost inflation  and improved product-mix at the Connected Home division. Supply Chain Solutions’ performance has been negatively impacted by lower demand in optical discs against a strong base of comparison. Vantiva revenues totaled €2 776 million  up 23.4% (+11.4% at constant exchange rate).Connected Home revenues amounted to €2 120 million for the fiscal year  an increase of 37.3% (+23.3% at constant exchange rate). Supply Chain Solutions revenues were €655 million  down 6.6% (-14.3% at constant exchange rate).Adjusted EBITDA improvement stems from the product mix-effect for Connected Home  better pass through of additional costs versus last year  and strict cost control in both divisions. The group’s adjusted EBITDA reached €161 million in the year  a €20 million improvement over last year. The margin dilution  from 6.3% to 5.8%  resulted from the higher contribution of the Connected Home division to the group’s adjusted EBITDA (+10pts) and a lower gross margin in percentage terms.Connected Home contributed €135 million (versus €103 million last year) to adjusted EBITDA while Supply Chain Solutions contributed €56 million (versus €67 million last year). FCF  before financial and tax  in the year was positive at €88 million  showing a €200 million improvement over last year  largely explained by the change in working capital. Outlook Visibility on the level of demand for Connected Home products is limited as Network Services Providers (NSP) are carefully managing their inventories  especially in the US  in a context of economic uncertainty. In 2023  Vantiva forecasts continuing growth for broadband products but anticipates a decline for video devices. Therefore revenues of Connected Home division are expected to be down  but on a challenging base of comparison due to the strong performance achieved last year. For SCS  activity should remain on the same trend as last year with a natural decline in demand for optical discs  but increased revenues for “growth activities”. The increase in vinyl production capacity should be the main growth driver in the latter area. Globally  the group expects a slight decrease in the division’s revenues.

At constant exchange rate  the growth would have been +23.3% compared with 2021. This revenue development has been driven by the combined positive effect of pricing and product-mix outweighing the volume decrease. Broadband business has been the main growth driver in the year representing 75% of revenues versus 64% the prior year  while demand for video devices suffered in some geographies  and especially in India. Globally  delivered units were down 4.4% mostly due to a drop in demand in Asia Pacific  notably in India and for entry level video products. Adjusted EBITDA of the division accounted for 84% of the group’s adjusted EBITDA compared with 73% in 2021. It amounted to €135 million in 2022 (vs €103 million in 2021)  or 6.3% of revenue (vs 6.7% in 2021). Despite the improvement in euro terms  the EBITDA margin fell 32 basis points over last year. This is mostly due to the dilutive impact of the measures implemented for countering inflation which brought additional revenues with no margin contribution. Supply Chain Solutions In € million 2022 2021 Change at current rate Change at constant rate Revenues 655 701 -6.6% -14.3% EBITDA 56 67 -15.5% -21.7% As a % of revenues 8.6% 9.5% Supply Chain Solutions revenues totaled €655 million in 2022  down 6.6% from 2021. At constant exchange rate the decline would have been 14.3%. Beyond the structural decline of the optical disc activity  the performance of the year has been severely impacted by the decline in demand from one major customer and a high base of comparison. Distribution and freight businesses were also down in the year. While growing  the other activities  have not been able to offset entirely this decline. The group has successfully launched vinyl production delivering its first 2 million albums in the year. Performance was however penalized by a slower intake of new vinyl presses than planned due to delivery delays  which prevented us from meeting the strong demand. Adjusted EBITDA of the division amounted to €56 million (vs €67m in 2021)  or 8.6% of revenues (9.5% in 2021)  Margin decline mainly resulted from the lower volumes in optical discs  distribution and freight activities  despite the positive development in the “growth activities”. The decline in EBITDA has been mitigated by the continued benefits of the cost reduction plan started in 2020 and the first contribution of the vinyl activity. In addition  the group has swiftly implemented additional footprint adjustment measures to mitigate the negative impact of the lower revenues.

The United Sates remained the first market of the group with 58% of revenues compared to 52% the previous year. The strong improvement of Connected Home (+37.3%) was driven by  North America  broadband products and forex  more than offsetting the decline of Supply Chain Solutions (-6.6%)  which was hit by lower optical disc demand. 2022 Adjusted EBITDA amounted to €161 million  up 14.3% year-on-year and 3.7% at constant rate. The EBITDA margin dropped by 46 basis points to stand at 5.8% of revenues. This decline reflects a slightly lower margin for both divisions and the higher weight of Connected Home division in the group’s total as this division generates a lower margin than SCS in percentage terms 2022 Adjusted EBITA of €55 million represented a €16 million year-on-year improvement. This resulted from the higher EBITDA and a moderate depreciation increase. EBITA margin improved by 23 basis points to 2.0% of revenues. PPA amortization was almost stable at -€31 million. Non-recurring items are coming from: restructuring costs accounting for -€17 million versus -€31 million in 2021 as the cost-cutting program “Panorama” launched by the division a few years ago is nearly completed other income and expenses that showed an expense of -€13 million related to litigations reserves and depreciation compared to income of €10 million in 2021 explained by a capital gain booked that year on disposals net impairment on non-current operating asset for -€5m vs -€2m in the previous year.EBIT from continuing operations was a -€11 million loss compared to -€13 million losses in 2021. The financial result totaled -€177 million in 2022  compared to -€117 million in 2021. About half of this amount stems from the costs related to the anticipated reimbursement as part of the spin off. Interest expenses  excluding operating leases  amounted to €84 million and included for 9 months the debt allocated to TCS during the spin off. Income tax amounted to -€30 million versus -€14 million in 2021. Result from associated is a loss of -€311 million  mostly explained by the depreciation of the value of our 35% stake in TCS. Net loss from continued operations amounted to -€529 million compared to -€143 million in 2021. Result of discontinued operations showed a profit of €680 million  explained by the gain booked on TCS’ valuation at the time of the spin off. Group net result therefore is a profit of €151 million in 2022  compared to a loss of -€140 million in 2021.

This significant improvement reflects the stronger EBITDA (+€20 million)  lower cash out for restructuring (+€39 million) and the change in working capital (+€155 million) while capex increased by €11 million. The change in working capital derived mainly from the negative impact related to changes in payment terms in 2021 with some Connected Home partners and new factoring facilities in 2022. Pension liabilities were down by -€66 million mainly due to a positive effect from discount rates of €49 million  and payments of €27 million. Cash outflow for restructuring totaled -€22 million in 2022 versus -€61 million in 2021. This sharp decrease is explained by the near completion of the cost optimization program launched in 2020. Capital expenditures amounted to -€80 million (up by €11 million). The majority is capitalized R&D for Connected Home. This increase reflects the attention paid by the group to innovation in order to supply state of the art technology. The cash position at the end of December 2022 was €167 million compared to €196 million at the end of December 2021. Net financial debt at nominal value amounted to €282 million at the end of December 2022 following the refinancing implemented at the time of the spin off. IFRS net debt amounted to €263 million as of December 31  2022. Post closing event Technicolor Creative Studios announced March 8th 2023  before market opening  that it had reached with its main shareholders and lenders an agreement on principle for its refinancing.

This is the result of the business transformations carried out in the recent past. The strong partnership with our customers and suppliers is also fundamental for our business performance.The excellent 2022 result is one more milestone in our ambitious strategy that we will continue to deploy. We remain focused on our core business  but will keep investing in other growth opportunities. We keep recruiting new key talents who will contribute to the execution of our medium and long term plans.Looking to 2023  while we are experiencing an improvement in the global supply chain and in the component shortages  we also see signs of broader macro-related inflationary uncertainties that are affecting consumer confidence. This is creating demand uncertainty for the year. We will keep working closely with our customers and suppliers to react quickly to any market events  and to keep delivering on our commitments to them and to our other stakeholders. Considering all this  we are confident of delivering on our guidance for 2023”.

Supply Chain Solutions’ performance has been negatively impacted by lower demand in optical discs against a strong base of comparison. Vantiva revenues totaled €2 776 million  up 23.4% (+11.4% at constant exchange rate).Connected Home revenues amounted to €2 120 million for the fiscal year  an increase of 37.3% (+23.3% at constant exchange rate). Supply Chain Solutions revenues were €655 million  down 6.6% (-14.3% at constant exchange rate).Adjusted EBITDA improvement stems from the product mix-effect for Connected Home  better pass through of additional costs versus last year  and strict cost control in both divisions. The group’s adjusted EBITDA reached €161 million in the year  a €20 million improvement over last year. The margin dilution  from 6.3% to 5.8%  resulted from the higher contribution of the Connected Home division to the group’s adjusted EBITDA (+10pts) and a lower gross margin in percentage terms.Connected Home contributed €135 million (versus €103 million last year) to adjusted EBITDA while Supply Chain Solutions contributed €56 million (versus €67 million last year). FCF  before financial and tax  in the year was positive at €88 million  showing a €200 million improvement over last year  largely explained by the change in working capital. Outlook Visibility on the level of demand for Connected Home products is limited as Network Services Providers (NSP) are carefully managing their inventories  especially in the US  in a context of economic uncertainty. In 2023  Vantiva forecasts continuing growth for broadband products but anticipates a decline for video devices. Therefore revenues of Connected Home division are expected to be down  but on a challenging base of comparison due to the strong performance achieved last year. For SCS  activity should remain on the same trend as last year with a natural decline in demand for optical discs  but increased revenues for “growth activities”. The increase in vinyl production capacity should be the main growth driver in the latter area. Globally  the group expects a slight decrease in the division’s revenues. Management also anticipates a persistent inflationary environment. However  thanks to operational efficiency and despite this context  the group is confident of meeting the following targets in 2023: EBITDA > €140mEBITA > € 45mFCF(1) > €50m (1) Before interests and tax II- Segment Review – Full Year 2022 Results HighlightsConnected Home Revenues breakdown by product In € million 2022 2021 Change at current rate Change at constant rate Revenues 2 120 1 544 37.3% 23.3% o/w by product Broadband 1 598 996 60.5% 43.4% Video 522 548 -4.9% -13.3% EBITDA adj 135 103 30.6% 19.5% As a % of revenues 6.3% 6.7% Connected Home revenues contributed 76% of group revenues (69% in 2021) and totaled €2 120 million in 2022  up 37.3%.

The EBITDA margin dropped by 46 basis points to stand at 5.8% of revenues. This decline reflects a slightly lower margin for both divisions and the higher weight of Connected Home division in the group’s total as this division generates a lower margin than SCS in percentage terms 2022 Adjusted EBITA of €55 million represented a €16 million year-on-year improvement. This resulted from the higher EBITDA and a moderate depreciation increase. EBITA margin improved by 23 basis points to 2.0% of revenues. PPA amortization was almost stable at -€31 million. Non-recurring items are coming from: restructuring costs accounting for -€17 million versus -€31 million in 2021 as the cost-cutting program “Panorama” launched by the division a few years ago is nearly completed other income and expenses that showed an expense of -€13 million related to litigations reserves and depreciation compared to income of €10 million in 2021 explained by a capital gain booked that year on disposals net impairment on non-current operating asset for -€5m vs -€2m in the previous year.EBIT from continuing operations was a -€11 million loss compared to -€13 million losses in 2021. The financial result totaled -€177 million in 2022  compared to -€117 million in 2021. About half of this amount stems from the costs related to the anticipated reimbursement as part of the spin off. Interest expenses  excluding operating leases  amounted to €84 million and included for 9 months the debt allocated to TCS during the spin off. Income tax amounted to -€30 million versus -€14 million in 2021. Result from associated is a loss of -€311 million  mostly explained by the depreciation of the value of our 35% stake in TCS. Net loss from continued operations amounted to -€529 million compared to -€143 million in 2021. Result of discontinued operations showed a profit of €680 million  explained by the gain booked on TCS’ valuation at the time of the spin off. Group net result therefore is a profit of €151 million in 2022  compared to a loss of -€140 million in 2021.

This significant improvement reflects the stronger EBITDA (+€20 million)  lower cash out for restructuring (+€39 million) and the change in working capital (+€155 million) while capex increased by €11 million. The change in working capital derived mainly from the negative impact related to changes in payment terms in 2021 with some Connected Home partners and new factoring facilities in 2022. Pension liabilities were down by -€66 million mainly due to a positive effect from discount rates of €49 million  and payments of €27 million. Cash outflow for restructuring totaled -€22 million in 2022 versus -€61 million in 2021. This sharp decrease is explained by the near completion of the cost optimization program launched in 2020. Capital expenditures amounted to -€80 million (up by €11 million). The majority is capitalized R&D for Connected Home. This increase reflects the attention paid by the group to innovation in order to supply state of the art technology. The cash position at the end of December 2022 was €167 million compared to €196 million at the end of December 2021. Net financial debt at nominal value amounted to €282 million at the end of December 2022 following the refinancing implemented at the time of the spin off.

The strong partnership with our customers and suppliers is also fundamental for our business performance.The excellent 2022 result is one more milestone in our ambitious strategy that we will continue to deploy. We remain focused on our core business  but will keep investing in other growth opportunities. We keep recruiting new key talents who will contribute to the execution of our medium and long term plans.Looking to 2023  while we are experiencing an improvement in the global supply chain and in the component shortages  we also see signs of broader macro-related inflationary uncertainties that are affecting consumer confidence. This is creating demand uncertainty for the year. We will keep working closely with our customers and suppliers to react quickly to any market events  and to keep delivering on our commitments to them and to our other stakeholders. Considering all this  we are confident of delivering on our guidance for 2023”.I- 2022 Key Highlights & 2023 OutlookIn € million  continuing operations 2022 2021 Change at current rate Change at Constant Rate Revenues 2 776 2 250 23.4% 11.4% Adjusted EBITDA 161 141 14.3% 3.7% As a % of revenues 5.8% 6.3% (46bps) (43 bps) Adjusted EBITA 55 39 39.7% 28.2% Free Cash Flow before Financial & Tax 88 (112) 200 1872022 Key Hi ghlightsThe group’s growth has been fueled by higher broadband volumes thanks to the success of our Fiber and Wi Fi 6 offer  price increases to partially recover cost inflation  and improved product-mix at the Connected Home division. Supply Chain Solutions’ performance has been negatively impacted by lower demand in optical discs against a strong base of comparison.Vantiva revenues totaled €2 776 million  up 23.4% (+11.4% at constant exchange rate).Connected Home revenues amounted to €2 120 million for the fiscal year  an increase of 37.3% (+23.3% at constant exchange rate). Supply Chain Solutions revenues were €655 million  down 6.6% (-14.3% at constant exchange rate).Adjusted EBITDA improvement stems from the product mix-effect for Connected Home  better pass through of additional costs versus last year  and strict cost control in both divisions.The group’s adjusted EBITDA reached €161 million in the year  a €20 million improvement over last year. The margin dilution  from 6.3% to 5.8%  resulted from the higher contribution of the Connected Home division to the group’s adjusted EBITDA (+10pts) and a lower gross margin in percentage terms.Connected Home contributed €135 million (versus €103 million last year) to adjusted EBITDA while Supply Chain Solutions contributed €56 million (versus €67 million last year).FCF  before financial and tax  in the year was positive at €88 million  showing a €200 million improvement over last year  largely explained by the change in working capital.OutlookVisibility on the level of demand for Connected Home products is limited as Network Services Providers (NSP) are carefully managing their inventories  especially in the US  in a context of economic uncertainty. In 2023  Vantiva forecasts continuing growth for broadband products but anticipates a decline for video devices. Therefore revenues of Connected Home division are expected to be down  but on a challenging base of comparison due to the strong performance achieved last year.For SCS  activity should remain on the same trend as last year with a natural decline in demand for optical discs  but increased revenues for “growth activities”. The increase in vinyl production capacity should be the main growth driver in the latter area. Globally  the group expects a slight decrease in the division’s revenues.Management also anticipates a persistent inflationary environment. However  thanks to operational efficiency and despite this context  the group is confident of meeting the following targets in 2023:EBITDA > €140mEBITA > € 45mFCF(1) > €50m(1) Before interests and taxII- Segment Review – Full Year 2022 Results HighlightsConnected HomeRevenues breakdown by productIn € million 2022 2021 Change at current rate Change at constant rate Revenues 2 120 1 544 37.3% 23.3% o/w by product Broadband 1 598 996 60.5% 43.4% Video 522 548 -4.9% -13.3% EBITDA adj 135 103 30.6% 19.5% As a % of revenues 6.3% 6.7%Connected Home revenues contributed 76% of group revenues (69% in 2021) and totaled €2 120 million in 2022  up 37.3%. At constant exchange rate  the growth would have been +23.3% compared with 2021. This revenue development has been driven by the combined positive effect of pricing and product-mix outweighing the volume decrease. Broadband business has been the main growth driver in the year representing 75% of revenues versus 64% the prior year  while demand for video devices suffered in some geographies  and especially in India.Globally  delivered units were down 4.4% mostly due to a drop in demand in Asia Pacific  notably in India and for entry level video products.Adjusted EBITDA of the division accounted for 84% of the group’s adjusted EBITDA compared with 73% in 2021. It amounted to €135 million in 2022 (vs €103 million in 2021)  or 6.3% of revenue (vs 6.7% in 2021). Despite the improvement in euro terms  the EBITDA margin fell 32 basis points over last year. This is mostly due to the dilutive impact of the measures implemented for countering inflation which brought additional revenues with no margin contribution.Supply Chain SolutionsIn € million 2022 2021 Change at current rate Change at constant rate Revenues 655 701 -6.6% -14.3% EBITDA 56 67 -15.5% -21.7% As a % of revenues 8.6% 9.5%Supply Chain Solutions revenues totaled €655 million in 2022  down 6.6% from 2021. At constant exchange rate the decline would have been 14.3%. Beyond the structural decline of the optical disc activity  the performance of the year has been severely impacted by the decline in demand from one major customer and a high base of comparison. Distribution and freight businesses were also down in the year. While growing  the other activities  have not been able to offset entirely this decline. The group has successfully launched vinyl production delivering its first 2 million albums in the year. Performance was however penalized by a slower intake of new vinyl presses than planned due to delivery delays  which prevented us from meeting the strong demand.Adjusted EBITDA of the division amounted to €56 million (vs €67m in 2021)  or 8.6% of revenues (9.5% in 2021)  Margin decline mainly resulted from the lower volumes in optical discs  distribution and freight activities  despite the positive development in the “growth activities”. The decline in EBITDA has been mitigated by the continued benefits of the cost reduction plan started in 2020 and the first contribution of the vinyl activity. In addition  the group has swiftly implemented additional footprint adjustment measures to mitigate the negative impact of the lower revenues.Corporate & OtherIn € million 2022 2021 Change at current rate Change at constant rate Revenues 1 5 -75.5% -75.5% EBITDA (30) (29) -3.8% nm As a % of revenues ns nsCorporate & Other recorded revenues of €1 million versus €5 million last year as the group disposed of its licensing activities in May 2022.Adjusted EBITDA amounted to -€30 million in line with last year which stood at -€29 million.

IFRS 17 is the first international accounting standard for insurance contracts and aims to create more consistency and comparability between companies. While the new accounting standard will impact Aegon's financial reporting  it will not impact its strategy  capital management approach  financial targets and outlook.During the webinar  Aegon will explain the choices it has made in implementing IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 and the impact of the new standards on its balance sheet and income statement by using selected key financial information.Reducing earnings volatilityThe new standard more closely aligns the valuation of assets and liabilities  which will reduce the impact from accounting mismatches in the financial results compared with the previous standards. Aegon has made accounting choices in implementing IFRS 17 where possible that allow for alignment of earnings with the relevant local capital frameworks and limit earnings volatility from accounting mismatches.Financial impact of the transition to new accounting standardsIn the IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 opening balance sheet of January 1  2022  Aegon's shareholders' equity is expected to decline to around EUR 11.7 billion from around EUR 17.8 billion excluding revaluation reserves under IFRS 4. This reflects the establishment of a contractual service margin (CSM) of EUR 11.8 billion pre-tax. The CSM represents a substantial stock of future value that is expected to be released through the operating result over time and to lead to a higher operating result than under IFRS 4.Further details will be shared during the educational webinar  that will be hosted by Matt Rider  CFO  and Jan Willem Weidema  Head of Investor Relations. The webinar will commence at 12:30 pm CET and a link to register for the livestream is available on the corporate website.

All initiatives to contain costs have been delivered on target. In December  Maisons du Monde paid to its employees an exceptional bonus as part of measures to support their purchasing power.Advertising expenses were managed with strict discipline  decreasing by 7% to €61 million vs €65 million in 2021. Focus was put on supporting online sales including the marketplace and on brand-reinforcing initiatives in a context of rising customer acquisition costs. Conversely  the discontinuation of paper catalogues resulted in substantial savings.Logistics costs decreased by 6% to €160 million compared to last year  even though the Group opened a second distribution center  thanks to further negotiations with carriers and enhanced efficiencies in operations.EBITDA was down -19% to €227 million with a margin at 18.3% vs €279 million in 2021 (margin at 21.4%)D&A expenses increased by €4 million at €159 million vs €155 million in 2021  mainly due to amortization directly linked to the €32 million increase in other intangible assets  property  plant and equipment and rights of use related to leases (IFRS 16).2022 EBIT reached €68.5 million with an associated margin of 5.5%. Other net operating expenses  at €5 million  were mainly related to store closure costs.Net financial result was €18 million vs €19 million in 2021  due to lower long-term debt and revolving credit facility interest expense compared to 2021  as well as gains on currency transactions.Income tax represented €18 million vs €26 million in 2021. The effective tax rate increased from 28% in 2021 to 35% due to a one-off international tax risk provision.Net income amounted to €34 million vs €79 million in 2021. EPS was €0.80  compared to €1.72 in 2021 (€1.52 without the positive 2021 effect of Modani’s disposal).Free Cash Flow above updated guidance  at €32 million(in EUR million) 31 Dec. 202231 Dec. 2021 EBITDA227.0 279.2 Change in working capital (2.8) 9.8 Change in other operating items (12.2) (37.9) Net cash generated by/ (used in) operating activities 212.0 251.1 Capital expenditures (Capex) (66.6) (51.5) Change in debt on fixed assets 5.3 2.4 Proceeds from sale of non-current assets 0.8 1.2 Decrease in lease debt (107.3) (102.1) Decrease in lease debt/Lease interest paid (11.8) (11.3) Free cash flow 32.3 89.8In 2022  total CAPEX amounted to €67 million  up +€15 million vs 2021  mainly related to the opening of the new distribution center and priority IT projects (Alma  Appshop and Marketplace). Conversely  the reduction in store openings (13 vs 21 in 2021) reduced network CAPEX needs.Regarding working capital requirement  the Group made significant headway on implementing more favorable payment term agreements with key suppliers. It also actively managed its shipping plans throughout the second half of 2022 to mitigate the excess inventory risk  while selectively rebuilding inventories to support upcoming sales. Inventory value was €246 million at year end (+€52 million vs 2021 mainly due to the material increase in cost of goods).Free cash flow amounted €32 million compared to €90 million in 2021  above the updated guidance of €10 million to €30 million  reflecting the €52 million decrease in EBITDA  additional capex described above  and negative effect of inventory offset by other working capital adjustments.Net financial debtNet debt & leverage(in EUR million) Net debt calculation31 Dec. 202231 Dec. 2021 Convertible bonds (“OCEANE”) 195.6 191.0 Term loan (0.5) - Revolving Credit Facilities (RCFs) (0.7) (0.1) Share buyback 28.1 29.3 Other debt 1.7 1.5 Gross debt 224.2 221.7 Finance leases 613.1 594.2 Cash & cash equivalents (121.3) (163.2) Net debt (IFRS 16) 716.0 652.6 Less: Lease debt (IFRS 16) (613.1) (594.2) Plus: Lease debt (finance lease) 2.2 2.7 Net debt 105.1 61.1 LTM (Last twelve months) EBITDA4 109.5 169.0 Leverage 0.96X 0.36XThe Group’s gross debt position as of 31 December 2022 was €224 million  broadly stable vs €222 million at the end of December 2021.

The cancellation will be effective on March 10th  2023. As a result  the Group’s share capital will amount to €133 million comprised of 40 988 097 shares.The Shareholders’ General Meeting is scheduled to be held on 29 June 2023  at which time shareholders will be asked to approve the payment of a dividend of €0.30 per share for the 2022 financial year  translating to a 37% pay-out ratio  in line with mid-term guidance (30%-40%).The ex-dividend date is 5 July 2023  with payment on 7 July 2023.2023: KEY PRIORITIES – GUIDANCE TO BE SPECIFIED IN MAYIn the context of high inflation and macroeconomic uncertainty  Maisons du Monde is fully committed to continuing to grow revenues by leveraging its highly attractive product portfolio and well-developed omnichannel approach. At the same time  the company will put clear emphasis on store productivity and operational excellence to restore its margins and return to robust cash generation. The company remains focused on developing a profitable and sustainable growth model  while capitalizing on its assets and strengths: Enhancing customer experience through its unique product portfolio and international omnichannel model to further increase customer loyalty and develop Maisons du Monde’s brand awareness  Continuing its ESG journey by further reducing its environmental impact and promoting equal opportunities as well as diversity and inclusion in its teams and beyond.Considering continued headwinds from macro trends that affect consumption and the high 2022 base for that period  we expect Q1 to be the low point of the year  with sales down in low double digits. The comparable base will start to ease in May and more so in the second half of the year.In this environment of persistently soft trading conditions  Maisons du Monde is developing forceful initiatives to preserve and improve its economic equation by adapting its cost structure and optimizing Capex with the ambition of progressively restoring its historical profitability level and cash generation. Maisons du Monde will specify its 2023 guidance in May.In the context of the current economic conditions  management is fully focused on the execution of the 2023 roadmap. As a result  the 2025 medium-term guidance is suspended until visibility improves.GOVERNANCEAs announced on January 25  2022  François-Melchior de Polignac will become Chief Executive Officer of Maisons du Monde from 15 March 2023.***Conference call for investors and analystsDate : 9 March 2023 at 09.00 am CETSpeakers :Julie Walbaum  CEO  François-Melchior de Polignac  Deputy CEO and Régis Massuyeau  CFOConnection details :***Financial calendar11 May 2023 Q1 2023 sales29 June 2023 Annual General Meeting27 July 2023 Q2 and H1 2022 financial results26 October 2023 Q3 and 9M 2022 salesDisclaimer: Forward Looking StatementThis press release contains certain statements that constitute ""forward-looking statements "" including but not limited to statements that are predictions of or indicate future events  trends  plans or objectives  based on certain assumptions or which do not directly relate to historical or current facts.

The non- IFRS operational and statistical information related to Group's operations included in this press release is unaudited and has been taken from internal reporting systems. Although none of these metrics are measures of financial performance under IFRS  the Group believes that they provide important insight into the operations and strength of its business. These metrics may not be comparable to similar terms used by competitors or other companies.Sales: Represent the revenue from 1) sales of decorative items and furniture through the Group’s retail stores  websites and B2B activities  2) marketplace commissions  and 3) service revenue and commissions. They mainly exclude:customer contribution to delivery costs  revenue for logistics services provided to third parties  and franchise revenue.The Group uses the metric of “Sales” rather than “Total revenue” to calculate growth at constant perimeter  like-for-like growth  gross margin  EBITDA margin and EBIT margin. Like-for-like sales (LFL) growth: Represents the percentage change in sales from the Group’s retail stores  websites and B2B activities  net of product returns between one financial period (n) and the comparable preceding financial period (n-1)  excluding changes in sales attributable to stores that opened or were closed during either of the comparable periods. Sales attributable to stores that closed temporarily for refurbishment during any of the periods are included. Gross margin: Is defined as sales minus cost of sales. Gross margin is also expressed as a percentage of Sales. EBITDA: Is defined as current operating profit  excluding: depreciation  amortization  and allowance for provisions and  the change in the fair value of derivative financial instruments. The EBITDA margin is calculated as EBITDA divided by Sales. LTM EBITDA: Last twelve months EBITDA. EBIT: Is defined as EBITDA minus depreciation  amortization  and allowance for provisions. The EBIT margin is calculated as EBIT divided by Sales. Net debt: Is defined as the Group’s finance leases  convertible bond (“OCEANE”)  unsecured term loan  unsecured revolving credit facilities  the French state guaranteed term loan  short- and long-term rental  deposits and bank borrowings  net of cash and cash equivalents. Leverage ratio: Is defined as net debt less finance leases divided by LTM EBITDA. Free cash flow: Is defined as net cash from operating activities less the sum of capital expenditures (capital outlays for property  plant and equipment)  intangible and other non-current assets  change in debt on fixed assets  proceeds from disposal of non-current assets and reduction of and interest on rental debt. ***1 2022 updated guidance: Top line: Decrease in the mid-single digit range - Ebit margin: 5% or above - Free cash flow: €10m to €30m - Dividend Pay-out ratio: 30% to 40% - Reduction of the Group’s carbon intensity: CO2 neutrality for scopes 1 and 2 2 Leverage: Net debt divided by LTM (Last twelve months) EBITDA 3 Sales for the 4th quarter of 2022 were commented in the Trading update press release published on January 26  2023 4 EBITDA of €117.3 million is restated in accordance with the senior credit facility agreement dated April 22  2022Attachment",neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.59,0.2,0.2,True,English,"['Maisons du Monde', '2022 Full-Year Results', 'François-Melchior de Polignac', 'cash savings action plan', 'new customer financing options', '2022 Full Year Key Figures', 'Free Cash Flow', 'Maisons du Monde', 'higher profitability level', 'second distribution center', 'teams’ exceptional commitment', 'selective price increases', 'influencer Lisa Gachet', 'Sakina M’Sa', 'sustained profitable growth', 'full year targets', 'several key milestones', 'two iconic collaborations', 'key opinion leader', 'two additional countries', 'balanced growth model', 'Total active customers', '3 million new customers', 'active customer base', 'gross margin erosion', 'unique omnichannel model', 'cash generation 2023 guidance', 'consumer love brand', 'Solid Group revenue', 'sustainable decoration products', 'store marketplace corner', '2022 KEY HIGHLIGHTS', 'sustainable growth', 'customer service', 'customer satisfaction', 'Omnichannel customers', 'Significant milestones', 'store operations', 'European leader', 'Base EPS', 'consumer confidence', 'inspiring collaborations', '8.6 million followers', 'three countries', 'solid foundations', 'eco-friendly products', 'products catalogue', 'sustainable home', 'sustainable fashion', 'English French', '2022 FULL-YEAR RESULTS', 'full-year guidance1', 'challenging environment', 'shareholder returns', 'Euronext Paris', 'affordable home', 'consolidated results', 'Conference call', 'Julie Walbaum', 'B2B operations', 'significant headway', 'ESG ambition', 'carbon footprint', 'Diluted EPS', 'Net debt', 'geopolitical uncertainty', 'inflationary context', 'supplier relationships', 'disciplined approach', 'same time', 'strategic agenda', 'ESG achievements', 'ESG DEVELOPMENTS', 'soft consumption', 'global community', 'social media', '+30% yoy increase', 'renowned creators', 'limited-edition collection', 'Memphis movement', 'organic cotton', 'pioneer designer', 'shopping experience', 'updated guidance', 'The Group', 'PRESS RELEASE', 'press mentions', 'operational initiatives', 'various initiatives', 'Financial performance', 'EBIT margin', 'Change Sales', 'living brand', 'GMV', 'FY', '2023 priorities', 'May', 'NANTES', '9 March', '07:00 CET', 'MDM', 'inspirational', '09:00 CET', 'details', 'page', 'CEO', 'internationalization', 'acceleration', 'opening', 'lasting', 'leadership', 'Leverage2', 'company', 'number', 'promotions', 'agility', 'cost', 'Q2', 'resources', 'future', 'strength', 'COMMERCIAL', 'creativity', 'engagement', '31 December', 'Collections', 'influencers', 'mission', 'desirable', 'ceramics', 'textiles', 'France', 'Spain', 'Italy', '200,000 references', '500 vendors', 'web', 'stores', '6 s']",2023-03-09,2023-03-10,globenewswire.com

FY 2022 online GMV was €449 million down -5% yoy due to declining traffic on Maisons du Monde’ website  in line with the sector  and partly offset by robust marketplace growth in France (+60% yoy) and by the dynamic ramp-up of the marketplace in Spain and in Italy. Marketplace GMV doubled compared to 2021 to €122million  accounting for 25% of total online GMV. FY 2022 sales were €1 240 million down -5% yoy (+5% vs 2019)  in line with the updated guidance.

Compared to 2019  sales in that region were up by +15%. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE In 2022  Maisons du Monde fully met its updated financial targets  thanks to the implementation of its forceful action plan to protect profit and cash in a soft consumption and highly inflationary environment. The Group succeeded in delivering its target of €5 million in cost savings at gross margin level and adjusting costs by €20 million at SG&A level to mitigate the impact of rising costs.

Facing adverse market conditions including a sharp increase in freight and raw material costs  energy price inflation and a material deterioration in the EUR/USD currency rate  the Group partly offset its gross margin erosion thanks to: a dynamic category mix management and discount strategy  containing the level of discount below 8% (similar to the pre-Covid period) gradual and selective price increases the generation of ambitious operating efficiencies  notably via further negotiations with suppliers  and freight forwarders and extra operational efficiencies.Store operating and central costs were broadly stable at €355 million vs €354 million in 2021  despite the inflationary context that impacted direct costs such as energy and rent and the reversal of €12 million in one-off unemployment subsidies and lease payment reductions that had been obtained in 2021. All initiatives to contain costs have been delivered on target. In December  Maisons du Monde paid to its employees an exceptional bonus as part of measures to support their purchasing power. Advertising expenses were managed with strict discipline  decreasing by 7% to €61 million vs €65 million in 2021. Focus was put on supporting online sales including the marketplace and on brand-reinforcing initiatives in a context of rising customer acquisition costs. Conversely  the discontinuation of paper catalogues resulted in substantial savings. Logistics costs decreased by 6% to €160 million compared to last year  even though the Group opened a second distribution center  thanks to further negotiations with carriers and enhanced efficiencies in operations. EBITDA was down -19% to €227 million with a margin at 18.3% vs €279 million in 2021 (margin at 21.4%) D&A expenses increased by €4 million at €159 million vs €155 million in 2021  mainly due to amortization directly linked to the €32 million increase in other intangible assets  property  plant and equipment and rights of use related to leases (IFRS 16). 2022 EBIT reached €68.5 million with an associated margin of 5.5%. Other net operating expenses  at €5 million  were mainly related to store closure costs.Net financial result was €18 million vs €19 million in 2021  due to lower long-term debt and revolving credit facility interest expense compared to 2021  as well as gains on currency transactions. Income tax represented €18 million vs €26 million in 2021. The effective tax rate increased from 28% in 2021 to 35% due to a one-off international tax risk provision. Net income amounted to €34 million vs €79 million in 2021. EPS was €0.80  compared to €1.72 in 2021 (€1.52 without the positive 2021 effect of Modani’s disposal).

Conversely  the reduction in store openings (13 vs 21 in 2021) reduced network CAPEX needs. Regarding working capital requirement  the Group made significant headway on implementing more favorable payment term agreements with key suppliers. It also actively managed its shipping plans throughout the second half of 2022 to mitigate the excess inventory risk  while selectively rebuilding inventories to support upcoming sales. Inventory value was €246 million at year end (+€52 million vs 2021 mainly due to the material increase in cost of goods). Free cash flow amounted €32 million compared to €90 million in 2021  above the updated guidance of €10 million to €30 million  reflecting the €52 million decrease in EBITDA  additional capex described above  and negative effect of inventory offset by other working capital adjustments.

CAPITAL ALLOCATION AND 2022 DIVIDEND On 29 July 2022  the Group launched a second share buyback program with an objective of repurchasing up to 10% of its outstanding shares at market price over a period of several months.By 31 January 2023  the Group had purchased 2 316 161 of its own shares  i.e. 54% of the program  at an average price per share of €10.19.On 8 March 2023  the Board of Directors decided to cancel 2 300 000 of the treasury shares (or 5.3% of the total shares) it acquired under this share buyback program. The cancellation will be effective on March 10th  2023. As a result  the Group’s share capital will amount to €133 million comprised of 40 988 097 shares. The Shareholders’ General Meeting is scheduled to be held on 29 June 2023  at which time shareholders will be asked to approve the payment of a dividend of €0.30 per share for the 2022 financial year  translating to a 37% pay-out ratio  in line with mid-term guidance (30%-40%).The ex-dividend date is 5 July 2023  with payment on 7 July 2023. 2023: KEY PRIORITIES – GUIDANCE TO BE SPECIFIED IN MAY In the context of high inflation and macroeconomic uncertainty  Maisons du Monde is fully committed to continuing to grow revenues by leveraging its highly attractive product portfolio and well-developed omnichannel approach. At the same time  the company will put clear emphasis on store productivity and operational excellence to restore its margins and return to robust cash generation. The company remains focused on developing a profitable and sustainable growth model  while capitalizing on its assets and strengths: Enhancing customer experience through its unique product portfolio and international omnichannel model to further increase customer loyalty and develop Maisons du Monde’s brand awareness  Continuing its ESG journey by further reducing its environmental impact and promoting equal opportunities as well as diversity and inclusion in its teams and beyond.Considering continued headwinds from macro trends that affect consumption and the high 2022 base for that period  we expect Q1 to be the low point of the year  with sales down in low double digits. The comparable base will start to ease in May and more so in the second half of the year. In this environment of persistently soft trading conditions  Maisons du Monde is developing forceful initiatives to preserve and improve its economic equation by adapting its cost structure and optimizing Capex with the ambition of progressively restoring its historical profitability level and cash generation. Maisons du Monde will specify its 2023 guidance in May. In the context of the current economic conditions  management is fully focused on the execution of the 2023 roadmap. As a result  the 2025 medium-term guidance is suspended until visibility improves.

FY 2022 online GMV was €449 million down -5% yoy due to declining traffic on Maisons du Monde’ website  in line with the sector  and partly offset by robust marketplace growth in France (+60% yoy) and by the dynamic ramp-up of the marketplace in Spain and in Italy. Marketplace GMV doubled compared to 2021 to €122million  accounting for 25% of total online GMV. FY 2022 sales were €1 240 million down -5% yoy (+5% vs 2019)  in line with the updated guidance. FY22 sales by channel FY online sales were €360 million  down -16% yoy but up +21% vs 2019 and represented 29% of Group sales over the year. FY store sales amounted to €881 million  stable both yoy and compared to 2019. Store traffic improved during the period compared to 2021  due to a positive base effect (stores were partly closed in H1 2021) but remained down from 2019. Continuing its active store network management  Maisons du Monde operated 357 stores at the end of December 2022  stable yoy  with 13 store openings and 13 closures over the year. Sales by category FY decoration sales amounted to €738 million  down 4% yoy  but up+12% vs 2019  and accounted for 60% of total sales. Frames  tableware  lighting  and scented candles performed particularly well amid persistently soft discretionary spending. FY furniture sales totaled €502 million  down -7% yoy and -4% vs 2019. Armchairs  sofas  bookcases and shelves were among best-sellers. Both categories benefitted from targeted promotions and continuing improvement in immediate availability. Sales by geography FY sales in France reached € 664 million  down -5% yoy due to the soft consumption environment and negative net store openings. Sales were broadly stable vs 2019 ( -1%). Online sales were down -16% yoy but up +19% vs 2019. FY international sales totaled € 577 million  down -5% yoy  but up +14% vs 2019. Combined sales in Spain and Italy (58% of total international sales) were up +2% yoy partly thanks to positive net store openings  and up +12% vs 2019. Combined sales in Belgium  Germany  and Switzerland (35% of total international sales) decreased by -13% yoy due to particularly poor market conditions and negative net store openings. Compared to 2019  sales in that region were up by +15%. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE In 2022  Maisons du Monde fully met its updated financial targets  thanks to the implementation of its forceful action plan to protect profit and cash in a soft consumption and highly inflationary environment. The Group succeeded in delivering its target of €5 million in cost savings at gross margin level and adjusting costs by €20 million at SG&A level to mitigate the impact of rising costs. EBIT margin at 5.5%  compared to an updated guidance of 5% or above Gross margin  EBITDA  EBIT(in EUR million) 2022 2021%Change Sales 1 240.4 1 306.8 -5.1% Cost of goods sold (437.9) (438.2) -0.1% Gross margin 802.5 868.5 -7.6% As a % of Sales 64.7% 66.5% Store operating and central costs (355.0) (354.4) 0.2% Advertising costs (60.6) (64.9) -6.7% Logistics costs (159.8) (170.0) -6.0% Operating Costs (575.5) (589.4) -2.4% EBITDA 227.0 279.2 -18.7%As a % of Sales 18.3% 21.4% Depreciation  amortization  and allowance for provisions (158.5) (155.4) 2.0% EBIT 68.5 123.8 -43.6% As a % of Sales 5.5% 9.5% FY2022 gross margin came in at 64.7%  above the revised objective but down 180 bps compared to 66.5% in 2021. Facing adverse market conditions including a sharp increase in freight and raw material costs  energy price inflation and a material deterioration in the EUR/USD currency rate  the Group partly offset its gross margin erosion thanks to: a dynamic category mix management and discount strategy  containing the level of discount below 8% (similar to the pre-Covid period) gradual and selective price increases the generation of ambitious operating efficiencies  notably via further negotiations with suppliers  and freight forwarders and extra operational efficiencies.Store operating and central costs were broadly stable at €355 million vs €354 million in 2021  despite the inflationary context that impacted direct costs such as energy and rent and the reversal of €12 million in one-off unemployment subsidies and lease payment reductions that had been obtained in 2021. All initiatives to contain costs have been delivered on target. In December  Maisons du Monde paid to its employees an exceptional bonus as part of measures to support their purchasing power. Advertising expenses were managed with strict discipline  decreasing by 7% to €61 million vs €65 million in 2021. Focus was put on supporting online sales including the marketplace and on brand-reinforcing initiatives in a context of rising customer acquisition costs. Conversely  the discontinuation of paper catalogues resulted in substantial savings. Logistics costs decreased by 6% to €160 million compared to last year  even though the Group opened a second distribution center  thanks to further negotiations with carriers and enhanced efficiencies in operations. EBITDA was down -19% to €227 million with a margin at 18.3% vs €279 million in 2021 (margin at 21.4%) D&A expenses increased by €4 million at €159 million vs €155 million in 2021  mainly due to amortization directly linked to the €32 million increase in other intangible assets  property  plant and equipment and rights of use related to leases (IFRS 16). 2022 EBIT reached €68.5 million with an associated margin of 5.5%. Other net operating expenses  at €5 million  were mainly related to store closure costs.Net financial result was €18 million vs €19 million in 2021  due to lower long-term debt and revolving credit facility interest expense compared to 2021  as well as gains on currency transactions. Income tax represented €18 million vs €26 million in 2021. The effective tax rate increased from 28% in 2021 to 35% due to a one-off international tax risk provision. Net income amounted to €34 million vs €79 million in 2021. EPS was €0.80  compared to €1.72 in 2021 (€1.52 without the positive 2021 effect of Modani’s disposal).

Conversely  the reduction in store openings (13 vs 21 in 2021) reduced network CAPEX needs. Regarding working capital requirement  the Group made significant headway on implementing more favorable payment term agreements with key suppliers. It also actively managed its shipping plans throughout the second half of 2022 to mitigate the excess inventory risk  while selectively rebuilding inventories to support upcoming sales. Inventory value was €246 million at year end (+€52 million vs 2021 mainly due to the material increase in cost of goods). Free cash flow amounted €32 million compared to €90 million in 2021  above the updated guidance of €10 million to €30 million  reflecting the €52 million decrease in EBITDA  additional capex described above  and negative effect of inventory offset by other working capital adjustments.

Taking into account its cash and cash equivalents position of €121 million (vs €163 million as of 31 December 2021)  Maisons du Monde’s net debt position on 31 December 2022 was €105 million (leverage of 0.96x  compared to 0.36x on 31 December 2021). CAPITAL ALLOCATION AND 2022 DIVIDEND On 29 July 2022  the Group launched a second share buyback program with an objective of repurchasing up to 10% of its outstanding shares at market price over a period of several months.By 31 January 2023  the Group had purchased 2 316 161 of its own shares  i.e. 54% of the program  at an average price per share of €10.19.On 8 March 2023  the Board of Directors decided to cancel 2 300 000 of the treasury shares (or 5.3% of the total shares) it acquired under this share buyback program. The cancellation will be effective on March 10th  2023. As a result  the Group’s share capital will amount to €133 million comprised of 40 988 097 shares. The Shareholders’ General Meeting is scheduled to be held on 29 June 2023  at which time shareholders will be asked to approve the payment of a dividend of €0.30 per share for the 2022 financial year  translating to a 37% pay-out ratio  in line with mid-term guidance (30%-40%).The ex-dividend date is 5 July 2023  with payment on 7 July 2023. 2023: KEY PRIORITIES – GUIDANCE TO BE SPECIFIED IN MAY In the context of high inflation and macroeconomic uncertainty  Maisons du Monde is fully committed to continuing to grow revenues by leveraging its highly attractive product portfolio and well-developed omnichannel approach. At the same time  the company will put clear emphasis on store productivity and operational excellence to restore its margins and return to robust cash generation. The company remains focused on developing a profitable and sustainable growth model  while capitalizing on its assets and strengths: Enhancing customer experience through its unique product portfolio and international omnichannel model to further increase customer loyalty and develop Maisons du Monde’s brand awareness  Continuing its ESG journey by further reducing its environmental impact and promoting equal opportunities as well as diversity and inclusion in its teams and beyond.Considering continued headwinds from macro trends that affect consumption and the high 2022 base for that period  we expect Q1 to be the low point of the year  with sales down in low double digits. The comparable base will start to ease in May and more so in the second half of the year. In this environment of persistently soft trading conditions  Maisons du Monde is developing forceful initiatives to preserve and improve its economic equation by adapting its cost structure and optimizing Capex with the ambition of progressively restoring its historical profitability level and cash generation. Maisons du Monde will specify its 2023 guidance in May. In the context of the current economic conditions  management is fully focused on the execution of the 2023 roadmap. As a result  the 2025 medium-term guidance is suspended until visibility improves.

Sales attributable to stores that closed temporarily for refurbishment during any of the periods are included. Gross margin: Is defined as sales minus cost of sales. Gross margin is also expressed as a percentage of Sales.

An explanation of these measures together with other abbreviated terms is provided at note 9 on page 25 of the Condensed Financial Statements.Revenue increased by €250.4 million (74.9%) to €584.9 million.EBITDA increase of €74.9 million to €127.2 million principally due to increased revenues and a continued focus on costs.The Ferries Division’s Dover – Calais service was further expanded by the introduction the Isle of Inisheer to the route on 26 April 2022. The introduction of the third vessel is the culmination of our planned investment for the route. This has made Irish Ferries a genuine alternative for all customers on the Channel route  with Irish Ferries now offering up to 30 sailings per day on the Dover – Calais route.The fleet was also increased with the acquisition of a container vessel  the CT Pachuca  bringing the total owned fleet to six ferries and eight container ships.The Group commenced operations at a container depot at the new Dublin Inland Port in January 2022 following an earlier public tender. This is an important facility for the Group as we look to expand our container operations in Dublin in the knowledge of the scarcity of space to expand in the core Dublin Port area.During 2022  the Group took delivery of a further five remote control semi-automated electric rubber-tyred gantry cranes (RTGs)  which brings the total number of electrically powered units at DFT to nine. Of the nine RTG’s  six are fully commissioned and in use  with a further three to be commissioned in Q2 of 2023  continuing our transition to this more environmentally efficient mode of operation. The Group has also ordered one new electrically powered ship-to-shore crane (STS) for delivery in 2023. The equipment replacement programme puts us on track to achieve emissions reduction targets of net zero emissions by 2030 in our terminal operations.The Group had strong cash generation during the year with cash generated from operations of €132.0 million (2021 €67.0 million). Cash outflows included strategic capital expenditure of €57.4 million (2021: €41.7 million)  share buybacks of €49.2 million (2021: €19.8 million) and dividends paid of €24.2 million (2021: €nil). Net debt at year end was €171.1 million (€128.7 million pre-IFRS 16) which was 1.2 times EBITDA under banking covenant definitions. The Group is in a strong financial position with available liquidity comprising cash and committed bank facilities of €67.4 million at 31 December 2022.Commenting on the results  Chairman John B. McGuckian said;“2022 has been a year not just of recovery but of building for long-term growth. With the Covid-19 pandemic now behind us  we have turned our full attention to maximising the opportunities that have arisen for the Group over the last two years. We come out of the pandemic with operations larger than we had at its commencement  and with a balance sheet that remains strong. 2022 saw the completion of our planned fleet investment for the Dover – Calais route. The entry to this route has been a long-term objective for the Group and the expansion to a three ship operation during 2022 allows us to compete effectively on this route. While there is some uncertainty around economic growth rates  we look forward to continued growth during 2023 through the leveraging of our recent investments and the continued support of all customers.”9 March 2023Enquiries: Eamonn Rothwell  Chief Executive Officer Tel: +353 1 607 5628 Email: info@icg.ie David Ledwidge  Chief Financial Officer Tel: +353 1 607 5628 Email: info@icg.ie Media enquiries: Q4 Public Relations Tel: +353 1 475 1444 Email: press@q4pr.ieResultsFinancial Highlights 2022 2021 Change Revenue €584.9m €334.5m +74.9% EBITDA €127.2m €52.3m +143.2% Operating profit / (loss) €66.7m €(0.2)mThe overall financial outcome for the Group was a profit before tax of €62.5 million (2021: loss of €4.1 million) while operating profit was €66.7 million (2021: loss of €0.2 million). EBITDA generated was €127.2 million (2021: €52.3 million) from total revenues of €584.9 million (2021: €334.5 million).EBITDA increased significantly on the prior year in our Ferries Division where EBITDA was €95.7 million (2021: €23.2 million). The division saw increased revenues from the easing of travel restrictions and expansion of the Dover – Calais service which was offset by an increase in costs  driven primarily by higher fuel prices and increased activity. Performance in our Container and Terminal Division improved with an increased EBITDA of €31.5 million (2021: €29.1 million) through a continued focus on cost optimisation and increases in revenue.As in the prior year  when the Group also faced challenging trading conditions  our diversified revenue streams and cost containment measures protected our strong balance sheet. Cash generated from operations amounted to €132.0 million (2021: €67.0 million) and together with loan drawdowns  this funded strategic capital expenditure of €57.4 million  share buybacks of €49.2 million and dividends of €24.2 million. Net debt at 31 December 2022 stood at €171.1 million (2021: €142.2 million). It is testament to the strength of the business and the balance sheet that  despite challenging trading conditions  we had the ability to continue investing in the future growth of our business.Operational ReviewICG operates through two divisions; the Ferries Division and the Container and Terminal Division. The Ferries Division  which owns and manages the Group’s fleet  operates under the Irish Ferries brand  offering passenger and RoRo freight services. The division is also engaged in ship chartering activities with vessels chartered within the Group and to third parties. The Container and Terminal Division includes the intermodal shipping line Eucon as well as the division’s strategically located container terminals in Dublin and its terminal operations in Belfast.Ferries DivisionFinancial summary 2022 2021 Change Revenue* €399.9m €175.5m +127.9% EBITDA €95.7m €23.2m +312.5% Operating profit / (loss) €46.4m €(17.4)m*Includes inter-segment revenue of €35.3 million (2021: €13.8 million)Operational Highlights 2022 2021 Change Volumes ‘000 ‘000 Cars 573.4 203.6 +181.6% Passengers 2 315.0 667.8 +246.7% RoRo freight units 696.6 290.0 +140.2%Revenue in the division was 127.9% higher than the previous year at €399.9 million (2021: €175.5 million). Revenue in the first half of the year increased by 166.9% to €167.9 million (2021: €62.9 million)  while in the second half revenue increased by 106.0%  to €232.0 million (2021: €112.6 million). EBITDA increased to €95.7 million (2021: €23.2 million) while operating profit was €46.4 million compared with a loss of €(17.4) million in 2021.Fuel costs were €104.6 million  an increase of €61.5 million on the prior year. The division achieved a return on capital employed of 14.9% (2021: (5.9%)). In total  Irish Ferries operated 13 865 sailings in 2022 (2021: 6 331)  the increase due to additional sailings on the Irish Ferries Dover – Calais service  commenced in June 2021  as it moved to a three vessel operation during 2022.Car and Passenger marketsIt is estimated that the overall car market  on the routes that we operate (Republic of Ireland to UK/France and the Dover Straits)  grew by approximately 147.2% in 2022 to 4 131 000 cars. While encouraging  this level of car carryings is still 23.9% behind 2019 levels.Irish Ferries’ car carryings during the year were increased over the previous year by 181.6% to 573 400 cars (2021: 203 600 cars). The increase in carryings versus 2021 levels is primarily due to the lifting of Covid-19 travel restrictions and the expansion to a three ship service on the Dover – Calais route.The total sea passenger market (i.e. comprising car  coach and foot passengers on the Republic of Ireland to UK/France and the Dover Straits) increased by 95.5% on 2021 to a total of 16.6 million passengers. Irish Ferries’ passenger numbers carried increased by 246.7% at 2 315 000 (2021: 667 800)..RoRo FreightThe RoRo freight market between the Republic of Ireland to the UK and France and the Dover Straits fell slightly in 2022. The total number of trucks and trailers decreased by 1.1%  to approximately 4 389 700 units.Irish Ferries’ freight carryings  at 696 600 freight units (2021: 290 000 freight units)  increased by 140.2% versus the prior year. The increased carryings over market performance was enabled through the additional capacity of the three vessel service on the Dover – Calais route.CharteringThe Group continued to charter a number of vessels to third parties during 2022. Overall external charter revenues were €17.2 million in 2022 (2021: €8.1 million). Of our eight owned LoLo container vessels  five are currently on charter to the Group’s container shipping subsidiary Eucon on routes between Ireland and the Continent whilst three are chartered to third parties. The Oscar Wilde continues on a bareboat hire purchase agreement with MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company SA.Container and Terminal DivisionFinancial summary 2022 2021 Change Revenue* €221.5m €174.0m +27.3% EBITDA €31.5m €29.1m +8.2% Operating profit €20.3m €17.2m +18.0%*Includes inter-segment revenue of €1.2 million (2021: €1.2 million)Operational Highlights 2022 2021 Change Volumes ‘000 ‘000 Containers shipped (teu) 322.6 346.6 (6.9%) Port lifts 319.6 335.5 (4.7%)Revenue in the division increased to €221.5 million (2021: €174.0 million). The revenue is derived from container handling and related ancillary revenues at our terminals and in Eucon from a mix of domestic door-to-door  quay-to-quay and feeder services with 74% (2021: 72%) of shipping revenue generated from imports into Ireland. With a flexible chartered fleet and slot charter arrangements  Eucon was able to adjust capacity and thereby continue to meet the requirements of customers in a cost effective and efficient manner.EBITDA in the division increased by 8.2% to €31.5 million (2021: €29.1 million) while operating profit grew 18.0% to €20.3 million (2021: €17.2 million). The division achieved a return on capital employed of 29.3% (2021: 25.5%).In Eucon  overall container volumes shipped were down 6.9% compared with the previous year at 322 600 teu (2021: 346 600 teu). Despite the reduction in volumes in Eucon and strong increases in the cost base  revenue and profitability increased due to recovery from our customers by increasing rates and the continued application of the flexible bunker and fuel surcharges.Containers handled at the Group’s terminals in Dublin Ferryport Terminals (DFT) and Belfast Container Terminal (BCT) were down 4.7% at 319 600 lifts (2021: 335 500 lifts). DFT’s volumes were down 4.5%  while BCT’s volumes were down 5.1%. While the reduction in volumes is disappointing  we are encouraged by the continued Revenue growth in the terminals offsetting the additional costs.Group Finance ReviewCash FlowA summary cash flow is presented below:2022 2021 €m €m Operating profit / (loss) (EBIT)* 66.7 (0.2) Depreciation and amortisation 60.5 52.5 EBITDA* 127.2 52.3 Working capital movements 1.2 11.7 Retirement benefit scheme movements 1.1 0.6 Share-based payment expense 3.0 1.3 Other movements (0.5) 1.1 Cash generated from operations 132.0 67.0 Interest paid (4.0) (8.4) Tax paid (1.7) (0.8) Capital expenditure excluding strategic capital expenditure (18.3) (13.5) Free cash flow before strategic capital expenditure* 108.0 44.3 Strategic capital expenditure (57.4) (41.7) Free cash flow after strategic capital expenditure 50.6 2.6 Proceeds on disposal of property  plant and equipment 3.0 2.8 Share issue 0.1 0.7 Settlement of employee equity plans through market purchases (2.9) (1.0) Dividends paid (24.2) - Share buyback (49.2) (19.8) Net cash flows (22.6) (14.7)*Additional information in relation to these Alternative Performance Measures (“APMs”) is disclosed on page 25.EBITDA for the year was €127.2 million (2021: €52.3 million). There was a net inflow of €1.2 million due to positive working capital movements  retirement benefit scheme movements of €1.1 million  share-based payment expense of €3.0 million and other net cash outflows amounting to €0.5 million  yielding cash generated from operations amounting to €132.0 million (2021: €67.0 million).Interest paid was €4.0 million (2021: €8.4 million) while taxation paid was €1.7 million (2021: €0.8 million).Capital expenditure outflows amounted to €75.7 million (2021: €55.2 million) which included €57.4 million of strategic capital expenditure. Strategic capital expenditure included the purchase of an eighth container vessel (the CT Pachuca)  the purchase of the Isle of Inisheer and RTG’s for Dublin Ferryport Terminal.There was €24.2 million (2021: €nil) of dividends paid during the year. There was €49.2 million (2021: €19.8 million) expended in buying back the Group’s equity.The above cash flows resulted in a year-end net debt of €171.1 million (2021: €142.2 million)  which comprised gross borrowings of €167.7 million (2021: €123.1 million)  lease obligations of €42.4 million (2021: €57.6 million) offset by cash balances of €39.0 million (2021: €38.5 million). The key net debt / EBITDA ratio was 1.2 times (2021: 2.6 times) under banking covenant definitions (see Appendix for further information).Balance SheetA summary balance sheet is presented below:2022 2021 €m €m Property  plant & equipment and intangible assets 364.2 330.1 Right-of-use assets 41.4 57.2 Long term receivable 10.5 13.6 Retirement benefit surplus 33.6 6.7 Other assets 85.2 65.8 Cash and bank balances 39.0 38.5 Total assets 573.9 511.9 Non-current borrowings 160.4 115.8 Non-current lease liabilities 30.7 37.5 Retirement benefit obligations 0.4 1.4 Other non-current liabilities 4.7 1.5 Current borrowings 7.3 7.3 Current lease liabilities 11.7 20.1 Other current liabilities 97.9 78.6 Total liabilities 313.1 262.2 Total equity 260.8 249.7 Total equity and liabilities 573.9 511.9The total net surplus of all defined benefit pension schemes at 31 December 2022 was €33.2 million in comparison to a €5.3 million surplus at 31 December 2021. The movement principally reflects a net actuarial gain of €29.4 million comprising a fall in asset values reflective of the investment market and a reduction in obligations due to higher discount rates. Movement in property  plant and equipment mainly relates to the acquisition of new vessels  partially offset by depreciation. The increase in other assets relates primarily to increased trade receivables. The movement in non-current borrowings principally relates to the drawdown during 2022 of €52.0 million worth of loans  offset by €7.6 million worth of scheduled repayments.Shareholders’ equity increased to €260.8 million from €249.7 million at 31 December 2021. The movement includes the profit for the financial period of €59.8 million  actuarial gains arising on retirement benefit schemes of €29.4 million  dividends paid of €24.2 million and buyback of equity of €49.2 million.FinancingThe borrowing facilities available to the Group at 31 December 2022 were as follows;Borrowing Facilities Facility Committed Committedfacilitiesdrawn Committed facilities undrawn €m €m €m €m Private placement loan notes 258.0 50.0 50.0 - Bank term loans 56.2 56.2 56.2 - Revolving credit 125.0 75.0 62.0 13.0 Overdraft and other 16.0 16.0 0.6 15.4 455.2 197.2 168.8 28.4At 31 December 2022  the Group had total lending facilities of €455.2 million available of which €197.2 million were committed facilities. Of these  €168.8 million have been utilised  of which €7.3 million are classified as repayable within one year. The interest rates on all Group borrowings at 31 December 2022  comprising loan notes and term loans  has been fixed at contracted rates at the date of drawdown with the relevant lender eliminating exposure to interest rate risk on borrowings. The average interest rate on borrowings at 31 December 2022 was 2.40% (2021: 1.60%) for remaining terms of between three months and 7.5 years. In addition to borrowings  the Group has recognised lease liabilities at 31 December 2022 relating to right-of-use assets amounting to €42.4 million.These facilities  together with undrawn committed facilities of €28.4 million and cash generated from operations  will be used to support the long-term strategic development of the Group.Fuel2022 2021 Change Fuel costs €124.0m €55.1m +125.0%Group fuel costs in 2022 amounted to €124.0 million (2021: €55.1 million). Bunker consumption was 161 900 tonnes in 2022 (2021: 129 400 tonnes). The increase in consumption was primarily due to increased sailings on the Dover – Calais service. The average cost per tonne of heavy fuel oil (HFO) fuel in 2022 was 47% higher than in 2021 while marine gas oil (MGO) was 107% higher than in 2021.In the Container and Terminal Division  bunker costs above a base level are offset to a large extent by the application of prearranged price adjustments with our customers. Similar arrangements are in place with freight customers in the Ferries Division. In the passenger sector  changes in bunker costs are included in the ticket price to the extent that market conditions will allow.Dividend and Share BuybackFollowing the easing of travel restrictions and the subsequent increase in our tourism carryings  the Directors declared and paid during 2022 a final dividend of 9.00 cent per ordinary share for 2021 and an interim dividend of 4.64 cent per ordinary share for 2022. Dividends paid during the year totalled €24.2 million. Payment of dividends had been suspended during 2020 and 2021 due to the effects of the Covid-19 travel restrictions on the financial performance of the Group.During the year  the Company bought back a total of 12.0 million shares which were cancelled. The total consideration paid for these shares was €49.2 million (2021: €19.8 million). The Directors are proposing a final dividend in respect of 2022 of 9.45 cent per share subject to shareholder approval at the AGM on 11 May 2023  which will be paid on 9 June 2023 to shareholders on the register at close of business on 19 May 2023.Exit of United Kingdom from the European UnionThe Group remains concerned at the lack of implementation of appropriate checks on goods arriving into Northern Ireland from Britain  which are required under the Northern Ireland Protocol. To the extent that goods are destined for the Republic of Ireland  this is causing a distortion in the level playing field as goods that arrive directly into the Republic of Ireland ports from Britain are being checked on arrival. The Group notes the proposals contained in the recent Windsor Framework  which as yet is not ratified by the UK Government and the EU. We welcome this initiative to introduce appropriate checks on goods moving between Britain and Ireland including movements via ports in Northern Ireland.Strategic DevelopmentsThe Group has continued to progress a number of key strategic developments during the year.In keeping with our progress over the last number of years  we have placed a significant focus on enhancing our approach to ESG and sustainability. We have rolled out a number of further initiatives across the Group and continued initiatives that commenced in prior years  highlights of which include the significant progress we have made in reducing the emissions of our container terminal operations. Continuing our expansion and modernisation programme at Dublin Port  2022 was a year of further material investment in this business. With the investment we have made and continue to make in more environmentally friendly terminal equipment  we are on course to achieve a reduction in the emissions from our container terminal operations of 70 per cent by 2025 over the course of the programme. With the progress made to date and the expected future investment  we expect to achieve our target of net zero emissions in our container terminal operations by 2030. We also continue to develop our environmental reporting processes in co-ordinating the collection of relevant data and considering how best this can be harnessed to affect behaviours in order to drive further improvement. This also provides the basis for increasing transparency over our sustainability credentials. We continue to engage with our stakeholders to understand their key pressing and material issues which we will evaluate and implement in our day to day business when appropriate.We introduced the Isle of Inisheer onto our Dover – Calais service as the third vessel on 26 April 2022. Joining the Isle of Inishmore and the Isle of Innisfree  this service now offers up to 30 sailings per day. Having commenced in June 2021  our service on Dover – Calais offers a genuine alternative for all users of the Channel Route.The Group also purchased a container vessel  the CT Pachuca  during the year. This brings the total number of container vessels owned by the Group to eight and upon delivery the vessel was chartered to Group subsidiary Eucon.During 2022  the Group took delivery of a further five remote control semi-automated electric RTG’s which brings the total number of electrically powered RTG’s at DFT to nine. Of the nine RTG’s  six are fully commissioned and in use with a further three to be commissioned during Q2 2023 continuing our transition to this more environmentally efficient mode of operation. The Group has also ordered one new electrically powered ship-to-shore crane (STS) for delivery in 2023. The deployment of these electric cranes puts us on track to meet our emissions reduction targets of net zero emissions by 2030.Belfast Container Terminal (BCT) operates the sole container terminal at Belfast under a services concession agreement with Belfast Harbour Commissioners (BHC) at a 27 acre site in Belfast Harbour. The £40 million re-investment project by BHC commenced in 2019 and continued into 2022. The project included extensive civil works and the delivery of two new ship-to-shore gantry cranes along with eight new electrically operated RTGs of which five are now in service. A further three RTG’s are scheduled to be commissioned in the second half of 2023. As per the investment in DFT  this investment is essential to reducing emissions in our terminal operations.The Group commenced operations at the new Dublin Inland Port in January 2022  under a 20 year lease agreement awarded following a public tender process. Trading as Dublin Ferryport Inland Depot (DFID)  this facility will be used for the remote storage  maintenance and upgrade of empty container boxes  releasing valuable capacity for the handling of containers in the port area. The Dublin Inland Port is located adjacent to Dublin Airport with direct access to the M50 Motorway (Dublin Ring Road) and Dublin Port via the Port Tunnel.Strategy and the EnvironmentThe Group is conscious that its activities have an environmental impact but is happy to note that reducing that impact aligns with our overall strategy. The Group has continued with the significant investments in installing exhaust gas cleaning systems (EGCS) and the ongoing program of electrification of heavy plant at our container terminals. Both of these investments  while reducing harmful emissions  also bring health and safety benefits to our operatives and align with the strategic objective of delivering sustained and profitable growth. This investment continued in 2022  including the commissioning of two additional electric cranes for our Dublin Ferryport Terminal. Three further electric RTG’s are on site and will be commissioned in 2023.The Group currently collects various data related to its environmental impact of its operations for external reporting purposes. In recognition of the powerful effect that data can have on creating awareness of individual actions  the Group collates and harnesses this data as a tool to promote environmental responsibility within the workforce. While we recognise that there is and always will be additional work to do in this space  we consider the ongoing improvement and progress together with the firm foundation established from prior years will enable the further development of our approach to sustainability  ESG and strong reporting in the years ahead.However  for certain aspects the Group will require the shipping sector as a whole to work together. This particularly relates to global regulation under the auspices of the International Maritime Organisation setting common standards and key equipment suppliers adopting the latest technologies. As a small operator in a global market  the Group will only apply proven technologies and we will recover the costs of same  either by increased efficiencies or by passing associated costs through to customers.The Group is aware that our stakeholders require us to be environmentally focused and the Group is committed to continuous improvement in everything that we do. Freight remains the backbone of the local Irish and European economies. Our efforts in greening the maritime industry is a vital part of moving the wider European economy to a sustainable footing in the face of the rising challenge from climate change.Current Trading and Outlook2023 Trading to date 1/1/23 – 4/3/23 1/1/22 – 4/3/22 Change Volumes ‘000 ‘000 Cars 50.0 35.2 +42.0% RoRo freight units 111.9 92.4 +21.1% Containers shipped (teu) 53.7 56.2 (4.4%) Port lifts 51.9 55.0 (5.6%)We have experienced strong growth in car and RoRo freight volumes in 2022  due partly to the unwinding of Covid-19 restrictions and also due to the expansion of our services on the Dover – Calais route. Container volumes were down slightly as they are more impacted by the slowdown in world growth and international trade volumes.In the period from 1 January 2023 to 4 March 2023  Irish Ferries carried 50 000 cars  an increase of 42.0% over the same period in the prior year. While these increases are encouraging  it is over a seasonally less significant time of the year for passenger travel. We do see an opportunity for material growth in our passenger business with the expected return to pre-pandemic levels.RoRo volumes in the Ferries Division have also started strongly in 2023. Overall  Irish Ferries RoRo volumes are up 21.1% on the same period in the prior year to 111 900 RoRo units. We expect that 2023 sees a continuation of the trend of freight customers returning to the landbridge and we are hopeful that the Windsor Framework will remove the distortion from the non-implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol. We welcome recent calls for the establishment of Green lanes on ferry routes between the UK and the Republic of Ireland  for traffic destined for Northern Ireland. This will ensure freight moves on and off the island of Ireland in the most efficient  timely and environmentally friendly manner.The Container and Terminal Division has seen a reduction in containers shipped in the period from 1 January 2023 to 4 March 2023 of 4.4%. The number of terminal lifts has seen a similar drop of 5.6% in the same period. This is indicative of a slowdown in the global economy and is not unexpected. However  the recent and ongoing investment in capacity expansion for longer term growth and plant modernisation at our container terminals will provide a platform for both growth and more efficient operations at our Dublin terminal. This will be further aided by the operations at our new Dublin Inland Port facility which commenced during 2022.We note the ever-increasing expectations and regulatory requirements to reduce the effects of our operations on the environment. While the Group acknowledges that its operations have an inevitable impact on the environment it does so in the knowledge that it operates essential services from the island of Ireland  which was clearly evident during the worst of the Covid-19 lockdowns. Our maritime transport operations remain the most environmentally sustainable form of transport for facilitating trade and movement of goods and people on and off the island. Nevertheless  reducing our impact on the environment is embedded in the Group’s DNA through maximising the effectiveness and efficiency in our operations while continuing to invest in appropriate technologies to reduce our impact on the environment.While there is some uncertainty around economic growth rates  we look forward to continued growth during 2023 through the leveraging of our recent investments and the continued support of all customers.Condensed Consolidated Income Statementfor the year ended 31 December 2022Notes 2022 2021 €m €m Revenue 2 584.9 334.5 Depreciation and amortisation (60.5) (52.5) Employee benefits expense (26.8) (20.8) Other operating expenses 2 (430.9) (261.4) Operating profit / (loss) 66.7 (0.2) Finance income 0.1 0.1 Finance costs (4.3) (4.0) Profit / (loss) before taxation 62.5 (4.1) Income tax expense 3 (2.7) (0.8) Profit / (loss) for the financial year: all attributable to equity holders of the parent 59.8 (4.9) Earnings per ordinary share– expressed in euro cent per share Basic 4 33.6 (2.6) Diluted 4 33.2 (2.6)Condensed Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Incomefor the year ended 31 December 20222022 2021 Notes €m €m Profit / (loss) for the financial year 59.8 (4.9) Items that may be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss: Currency translation adjustment (2.5) 1.3 Items that will not be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss: Actuarial gain on defined benefit obligations 7 29.4 7.1 Deferred tax on defined benefit pension schemes (2.4)(0.9)Other comprehensive income for the financial year 24.5 7.5 Total comprehensive income for the financial year: all attributable to equity holders of the parent 84.3 2.6Condensed Consolidated Statement of Financial Positionas at 31 December 20222022 2021 Notes €m €m Assets Non-current assets Property  plant and equipment 362.3 328.2 Intangible assets 1.9 1.9 Right-of-use assets 41.4 57.2 Retirement benefit surplus 7 33.6 6.7 Finance lease receivable 10.5 13.6 Deferred tax asset 0.1 0.1 449.8 407.7 Current assets Inventories 5.2 3.8 Trade and other receivables 79.9 61.9 Cash and bank balances 5 39.0 38.5 124.1 104.2 Total assets 573.9 511.9 Equity and liabilities Equity Share capital 11.1 11.9 Share premium 20.5 20.4 Other reserves (8.2) (8.1) Retained earnings 237.4 225.5 Equity attributable to equity holders 260.8 249.7 Non-current liabilities Borrowings 5 160.4 115.8 Lease liabilities 5 30.7 37.5 Deferred tax liabilities 3.6 1.3 Provisions 1.1 0.2 Retirement benefit obligation 7 0.4 1.4 196.2 156.2 Current liabilities Borrowings 5 7.3 7.3 Lease liabilities 5 11.7 20.1 Trade and other payables 96.2 75.5 Provisions 1.7 3.1 116.9 106.0 Total liabilities 313.1 262.2 Total equity and liabilities 573.9 511.9Condensed Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equityfor the year ended 31 December 2022Share Share Other Retained Capital Premium Reserves Earnings Total €m €m €m €m €m Balance at 1 January 2022 11.9 20.4 (8.1) 225.5 249.7 Profit for the financial year -

Segmental informationThe Executive Board is deemed the chief operating decision maker within the Group. For management purposes  the Group is currently organised into two operating segments: Ferries and Container and Terminal.Revenue has been disaggregated into categories which reflect how the nature  amount  timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. As revenues are recognised over short time periods of no more than days  a key determinant to categorising revenues is whether they principally arise from a business to customer or a business to business relationship as this impacts directly on the uncertainty of cash flows.i) Revenue analysisBy business segment:2022 2021 €m €m Ferries Passenger 162.7 59.0 Freight 184.7 94.6 Charter and other 52.5 21.9 399.9 175.5 Container and Terminal Freight 221.5 174.0 Inter-segment revenue (36.5) (15.0) Total 584.9 334.5By geographic origin of booking:2022 2021 €m €m Ireland 202.4 135.6 United Kingdom 142.2 64.1 Netherlands 99.7 73.7 Belgium 47.7 36.7 France 20.2 4.5 Poland 18.8 4.5 Austria 10.8 0.8 Other 43.1 14.6 584.9 334.5No single external customer in the current or prior financial year amounted to 10 per cent of the Group’s revenues.ii) Profit / (loss) for the financial yearFerries Container & Terminal Group Total 2022€m 2021€m 2022€m 2021€m 2022€m 2021€m Operating profit / (loss) 46.4 (17.4) 20.3 17.2 66.7 (0.2) Finance income 0.1 - - 0.1 0.1 0.1 Finance costs (3.1) (2.0) (1.2) (2.0) (4.3) (4.0) Profit / (loss) before tax 43.4 (19.4) 19.1 15.3 62.5 (4.1) Income tax expense (1.3) (0.1) (1.4) (0.7) (2.7) (0.8) Profit / (loss) for the financial year 42.1 (19.5) 17.7 14.6 59.8 (4.9)iii) Other operating expensesFerries Container & Terminal Group Total 2022€m 2021€m 2022€m 2021€m 2022€m 2021€m Fuel 104.6 43.1 19.4 12.0 124.0 55.1 Labour 48.3 28.7 12.6 9.7 60.9 38.4 Port costs 69.0 44.0 35.2 33.7 104.2 77.7 Haulage - - 56.6 50.0 56.6 50.0 Other 61.3 20.7 60.4 34.5 121.7 55.2 Inter-segment (1.2) (1.2) (35.3) (13.8) (36.5) (15.0) Other operating expenses 282.0 135.3 148.9 126.1 430.9 261.4iv) Statement of Financial PositionFerries Container & Terminal Group Total 2022€m 2021€m 2022€m 2021€m 2022€m 2021€m Assets Segment assets 422.5 367.0 112.4 106.4 534.9 473.4 Cash and cash equivalents 34.5 29.9 4.5 8.6 39.0 38.5 Consolidated total assets 457.0 396.9 116.9 115.0 573.9 511.9 Liabilities Segment liabilities 66.7 49.8 36.3 31.7 103.0 81.5 Borrowings and lease liabilities 174.6 140.0 35.5 40.7 210.1 180.7 Consolidated total liabilities 241.3 189.8 71.8 72.4 313.1 262.23.

Under the tonnage tax method  taxable profit on eligible activities is calculated on a specified notional profit per day related to the tonnage of the vessels utilised.In accordance with the IFRIC guidance on IAS 12 Income Taxes  the tonnage tax charge is not considered an income tax expense and has been included in other operating expenses in the Consolidated Income Statement.Domestic income tax is calculated at 12.5% of the estimated assessable profit for the year for all activities which do not fall to be taxed under the tonnage tax system. Taxation for other jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in the relevant jurisdictions. The income tax expense for the year includes a current tax charge of €2.7 million (2021: €0.7 million) and a deferred tax charge of €nil million (2021: €0.1 million.The total expense for the year is reconciled to the accounting profit as follows:2022 2021 €m €m Profit / (loss) before tax 62.5 (4.1) Tax at the domestic income tax rate of 12.5% (2021: 12.5%) 7.8 - Losses not eligible for surrender under loss provisions - 2.4 Effect of tonnage relief (6.6) (2.2) Difference in effective tax rates 0.3 0.8 Other items 1.2 (0.2)Income tax expense recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement 2.7 0.84.

Where the performance conditions have been met at the end of the performance period and the awards remain unexercised  they are no longer treated as contingently issuable and are treated as issued shares from the end of the performance period and included in the weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purpose of basic earnings per share.Those contingently issuable shares for which the performance period has not yet expired  are included in the weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purposes of diluted earnings per share unless the performance conditions governing their exercisability have not been met at the reporting date.A total of 664 484 (2021: 3 646 828) unvested share options outstanding at the reporting date have been excluded from the weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purposes of diluted earnings per share as they were either antidilutive or had not met the performance conditions governing their exercisability.The earnings used in both the adjusted basic and adjusted diluted earnings per share are adjusted to take into account the net interest on defined benefit obligations and the effect of non-trading items after tax.

Revenue increased by €250.4 million (74.9%) to €584.9 million.EBITDA increase of €74.9 million to €127.2 million principally due to increased revenues and a continued focus on costs.The Ferries Division’s Dover – Calais service was further expanded by the introduction the Isle of Inisheer to the route on 26 April 2022. The introduction of the third vessel is the culmination of our planned investment for the route. This has made Irish Ferries a genuine alternative for all customers on the Channel route  with Irish Ferries now offering up to 30 sailings per day on the Dover – Calais route.The fleet was also increased with the acquisition of a container vessel  the CT Pachuca  bringing the total owned fleet to six ferries and eight container ships.The Group commenced operations at a container depot at the new Dublin Inland Port in January 2022 following an earlier public tender. This is an important facility for the Group as we look to expand our container operations in Dublin in the knowledge of the scarcity of space to expand in the core Dublin Port area.During 2022  the Group took delivery of a further five remote control semi-automated electric rubber-tyred gantry cranes (RTGs)  which brings the total number of electrically powered units at DFT to nine. Of the nine RTG’s  six are fully commissioned and in use  with a further three to be commissioned in Q2 of 2023  continuing our transition to this more environmentally efficient mode of operation. The Group has also ordered one new electrically powered ship-to-shore crane (STS) for delivery in 2023. The equipment replacement programme puts us on track to achieve emissions reduction targets of net zero emissions by 2030 in our terminal operations.The Group had strong cash generation during the year with cash generated from operations of €132.0 million (2021 €67.0 million). Cash outflows included strategic capital expenditure of €57.4 million (2021: €41.7 million)  share buybacks of €49.2 million (2021: €19.8 million) and dividends paid of €24.2 million (2021: €nil). Net debt at year end was €171.1 million (€128.7 million pre-IFRS 16) which was 1.2 times EBITDA under banking covenant definitions. The Group is in a strong financial position with available liquidity comprising cash and committed bank facilities of €67.4 million at 31 December 2022.Commenting on the results  Chairman John B. McGuckian said; “2022 has been a year not just of recovery but of building for long-term growth. With the Covid-19 pandemic now behind us  we have turned our full attention to maximising the opportunities that have arisen for the Group over the last two years. We come out of the pandemic with operations larger than we had at its commencement  and with a balance sheet that remains strong. 2022 saw the completion of our planned fleet investment for the Dover – Calais route. The entry to this route has been a long-term objective for the Group and the expansion to a three ship operation during 2022 allows us to compete effectively on this route. While there is some uncertainty around economic growth rates  we look forward to continued growth during 2023 through the leveraging of our recent investments and the continued support of all customers.” 9 March 2023Enquiries: Eamonn Rothwell  Chief Executive Officer Tel: +353 1 607 5628 Email: info@icg.ie David Ledwidge  Chief Financial Officer Tel: +353 1 607 5628 Email: info@icg.ie Media enquiries: Q4 Public Relations Tel: +353 1 475 1444 Email: press@q4pr.ie Results Financial Highlights 2022 2021 Change Revenue €584.9m €334.5m +74.9% EBITDA €127.2m €52.3m +143.2% Operating profit / (loss) €66.7m €(0.2)m The overall financial outcome for the Group was a profit before tax of €62.5 million (2021: loss of €4.1 million) while operating profit was €66.7 million (2021: loss of €0.2 million). EBITDA generated was €127.2 million (2021: €52.3 million) from total revenues of €584.9 million (2021: €334.5 million). EBITDA increased significantly on the prior year in our Ferries Division where EBITDA was €95.7 million (2021: €23.2 million). The division saw increased revenues from the easing of travel restrictions and expansion of the Dover – Calais service which was offset by an increase in costs  driven primarily by higher fuel prices and increased activity. Performance in our Container and Terminal Division improved with an increased EBITDA of €31.5 million (2021: €29.1 million) through a continued focus on cost optimisation and increases in revenue. As in the prior year  when the Group also faced challenging trading conditions  our diversified revenue streams and cost containment measures protected our strong balance sheet. Cash generated from operations amounted to €132.0 million (2021: €67.0 million) and together with loan drawdowns  this funded strategic capital expenditure of €57.4 million  share buybacks of €49.2 million and dividends of €24.2 million. Net debt at 31 December 2022 stood at €171.1 million (2021: €142.2 million). It is testament to the strength of the business and the balance sheet that  despite challenging trading conditions  we had the ability to continue investing in the future growth of our business. Operational Review ICG operates through two divisions; the Ferries Division and the Container and Terminal Division. The Ferries Division  which owns and manages the Group’s fleet  operates under the Irish Ferries brand  offering passenger and RoRo freight services. The division is also engaged in ship chartering activities with vessels chartered within the Group and to third parties. The Container and Terminal Division includes the intermodal shipping line Eucon as well as the division’s strategically located container terminals in Dublin and its terminal operations in Belfast.

Revenue in the first half of the year increased by 166.9% to €167.9 million (2021: €62.9 million)  while in the second half revenue increased by 106.0%  to €232.0 million (2021: €112.6 million). EBITDA increased to €95.7 million (2021: €23.2 million) while operating profit was €46.4 million compared with a loss of €(17.4) million in 2021. Fuel costs were €104.6 million  an increase of €61.5 million on the prior year. The division achieved a return on capital employed of 14.9% (2021: (5.9%)). In total  Irish Ferries operated 13 865 sailings in 2022 (2021: 6 331)  the increase due to additional sailings on the Irish Ferries Dover – Calais service  commenced in June 2021  as it moved to a three vessel operation during 2022. Car and Passenger markets It is estimated that the overall car market  on the routes that we operate (Republic of Ireland to UK/France and the Dover Straits)  grew by approximately 147.2% in 2022 to 4 131 000 cars. While encouraging  this level of car carryings is still 23.9% behind 2019 levels. Irish Ferries’ car carryings during the year were increased over the previous year by 181.6% to 573 400 cars (2021: 203 600 cars). The increase in carryings versus 2021 levels is primarily due to the lifting of Covid-19 travel restrictions and the expansion to a three ship service on the Dover – Calais route. The total sea passenger market (i.e. comprising car  coach and foot passengers on the Republic of Ireland to UK/France and the Dover Straits) increased by 95.5% on 2021 to a total of 16.6 million passengers. Irish Ferries’ passenger numbers carried increased by 246.7% at 2 315 000 (2021: 667 800).. RoRo Freight The RoRo freight market between the Republic of Ireland to the UK and France and the Dover Straits fell slightly in 2022. The total number of trucks and trailers decreased by 1.1%  to approximately 4 389 700 units. Irish Ferries’ freight carryings  at 696 600 freight units (2021: 290 000 freight units)  increased by 140.2% versus the prior year. The increased carryings over market performance was enabled through the additional capacity of the three vessel service on the Dover – Calais route. Chartering The Group continued to charter a number of vessels to third parties during 2022. Overall external charter revenues were €17.2 million in 2022 (2021: €8.1 million). Of our eight owned LoLo container vessels  five are currently on charter to the Group’s container shipping subsidiary Eucon on routes between Ireland and the Continent whilst three are chartered to third parties. The Oscar Wilde continues on a bareboat hire purchase agreement with MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company SA.

With a flexible chartered fleet and slot charter arrangements  Eucon was able to adjust capacity and thereby continue to meet the requirements of customers in a cost effective and efficient manner.EBITDA in the division increased by 8.2% to €31.5 million (2021: €29.1 million) while operating profit grew 18.0% to €20.3 million (2021: €17.2 million).

In Eucon  overall container volumes shipped were down 6.9% compared with the previous year at 322 600 teu (2021: 346 600 teu). Despite the reduction in volumes in Eucon and strong increases in the cost base  revenue and profitability increased due to recovery from our customers by increasing rates and the continued application of the flexible bunker and fuel surcharges. Containers handled at the Group’s terminals in Dublin Ferryport Terminals (DFT) and Belfast Container Terminal (BCT) were down 4.7% at 319 600 lifts (2021: 335 500 lifts). DFT’s volumes were down 4.5%  while BCT’s volumes were down 5.1%. While the reduction in volumes is disappointing  we are encouraged by the continued Revenue growth in the terminals offsetting the additional costs.

EBITDA for the year was €127.2 million (2021: €52.3 million). There was a net inflow of €1.2 million due to positive working capital movements  retirement benefit scheme movements of €1.1 million  share-based payment expense of €3.0 million and other net cash outflows amounting to €0.5 million  yielding cash generated from operations amounting to €132.0 million (2021: €67.0 million). Interest paid was €4.0 million (2021: €8.4 million) while taxation paid was €1.7 million (2021: €0.8 million). Capital expenditure outflows amounted to €75.7 million (2021: €55.2 million) which included €57.4 million of strategic capital expenditure. Strategic capital expenditure included the purchase of an eighth container vessel (the CT Pachuca)  the purchase of the Isle of Inisheer and RTG’s for Dublin Ferryport Terminal. There was €24.2 million (2021: €nil) of dividends paid during the year. There was €49.2 million (2021: €19.8 million) expended in buying back the Group’s equity. The above cash flows resulted in a year-end net debt of €171.1 million (2021: €142.2 million)  which comprised gross borrowings of €167.7 million (2021: €123.1 million)  lease obligations of €42.4 million (2021: €57.6 million) offset by cash balances of €39.0 million (2021: €38.5 million). The key net debt / EBITDA ratio was 1.2 times (2021: 2.6 times) under banking covenant definitions (see Appendix for further information). Balance Sheet A summary balance sheet is presented below: 2022 2021 €m €m Property  plant & equipment and intangible assets 364.2 330.1 Right-of-use assets 41.4 57.2 Long term receivable 10.5 13.6 Retirement benefit surplus 33.6 6.7 Other assets 85.2 65.8 Cash and bank balances 39.0 38.5 Total assets 573.9 511.9 Non-current borrowings 160.4 115.8 Non-current lease liabilities 30.7 37.5 Retirement benefit obligations 0.4 1.4 Other non-current liabilities 4.7 1.5 Current borrowings 7.3 7.3 Current lease liabilities 11.7 20.1 Other current liabilities 97.9 78.6 Total liabilities 313.1 262.2 Total equity 260.8 249.7 Total equity and liabilities 573.9 511.9 The total net surplus of all defined benefit pension schemes at 31 December 2022 was €33.2 million in comparison to a €5.3 million surplus at 31 December 2021. The movement principally reflects a net actuarial gain of €29.4 million comprising a fall in asset values reflective of the investment market and a reduction in obligations due to higher discount rates. Movement in property  plant and equipment mainly relates to the acquisition of new vessels  partially offset by depreciation. The increase in other assets relates primarily to increased trade receivables. The movement in non-current borrowings principally relates to the drawdown during 2022 of €52.0 million worth of loans  offset by €7.6 million worth of scheduled repayments. Shareholders’ equity increased to €260.8 million from €249.7 million at 31 December 2021. The movement includes the profit for the financial period of €59.8 million  actuarial gains arising on retirement benefit schemes of €29.4 million  dividends paid of €24.2 million and buyback of equity of €49.2 million. FinancingThe borrowing facilities available to the Group at 31 December 2022 were as follows; Borrowing Facilities Facility Committed Committedfacilitiesdrawn Committed facilities undrawn €m €m €m €m Private placement loan notes 258.0 50.0 50.0 - Bank term loans 56.2 56.2 56.2 - Revolving credit 125.0 75.0 62.0 13.0 Overdraft and other 16.0 16.0 0.6 15.4 455.2 197.2 168.8 28.4 At 31 December 2022  the Group had total lending facilities of €455.2 million available of which €197.2 million were committed facilities. Of these  €168.8 million have been utilised  of which €7.3 million are classified as repayable within one year. The interest rates on all Group borrowings at 31 December 2022  comprising loan notes and term loans  has been fixed at contracted rates at the date of drawdown with the relevant lender eliminating exposure to interest rate risk on borrowings. The average interest rate on borrowings at 31 December 2022 was 2.40% (2021: 1.60%) for remaining terms of between three months and 7.5 years. In addition to borrowings  the Group has recognised lease liabilities at 31 December 2022 relating to right-of-use assets amounting to €42.4 million. These facilities  together with undrawn committed facilities of €28.4 million and cash generated from operations  will be used to support the long-term strategic development of the Group. Fuel 2022 2021 Change Fuel costs €124.0m €55.1m +125.0% Group fuel costs in 2022 amounted to €124.0 million (2021: €55.1 million). Bunker consumption was 161 900 tonnes in 2022 (2021: 129 400 tonnes). The increase in consumption was primarily due to increased sailings on the Dover – Calais service. The average cost per tonne of heavy fuel oil (HFO) fuel in 2022 was 47% higher than in 2021 while marine gas oil (MGO) was 107% higher than in 2021. In the Container and Terminal Division  bunker costs above a base level are offset to a large extent by the application of prearranged price adjustments with our customers. Similar arrangements are in place with freight customers in the Ferries Division. In the passenger sector  changes in bunker costs are included in the ticket price to the extent that market conditions will allow. Dividend and Share Buyback Following the easing of travel restrictions and the subsequent increase in our tourism carryings  the Directors declared and paid during 2022 a final dividend of 9.00 cent per ordinary share for 2021 and an interim dividend of 4.64 cent per ordinary share for 2022. Dividends paid during the year totalled €24.2 million. Payment of dividends had been suspended during 2020 and 2021 due to the effects of the Covid-19 travel restrictions on the financial performance of the Group. During the year  the Company bought back a total of 12.0 million shares which were cancelled. The total consideration paid for these shares was €49.2 million (2021: €19.8 million). The Directors are proposing a final dividend in respect of 2022 of 9.45 cent per share subject to shareholder approval at the AGM on 11 May 2023  which will be paid on 9 June 2023 to shareholders on the register at close of business on 19 May 2023. Exit of United Kingdom from the European Union The Group remains concerned at the lack of implementation of appropriate checks on goods arriving into Northern Ireland from Britain  which are required under the Northern Ireland Protocol. To the extent that goods are destined for the Republic of Ireland  this is causing a distortion in the level playing field as goods that arrive directly into the Republic of Ireland ports from Britain are being checked on arrival. The Group notes the proposals contained in the recent Windsor Framework  which as yet is not ratified by the UK Government and the EU. We welcome this initiative to introduce appropriate checks on goods moving between Britain and Ireland including movements via ports in Northern Ireland. Strategic Developments The Group has continued to progress a number of key strategic developments during the year. In keeping with our progress over the last number of years  we have placed a significant focus on enhancing our approach to ESG and sustainability. We have rolled out a number of further initiatives across the Group and continued initiatives that commenced in prior years  highlights of which include the significant progress we have made in reducing the emissions of our container terminal operations. Continuing our expansion and modernisation programme at Dublin Port  2022 was a year of further material investment in this business. With the investment we have made and continue to make in more environmentally friendly terminal equipment  we are on course to achieve a reduction in the emissions from our container terminal operations of 70 per cent by 2025 over the course of the programme. With the progress made to date and the expected future investment  we expect to achieve our target of net zero emissions in our container terminal operations by 2030. We also continue to develop our environmental reporting processes in co-ordinating the collection of relevant data and considering how best this can be harnessed to affect behaviours in order to drive further improvement. This also provides the basis for increasing transparency over our sustainability credentials. We continue to engage with our stakeholders to understand their key pressing and material issues which we will evaluate and implement in our day to day business when appropriate. We introduced the Isle of Inisheer onto our Dover – Calais service as the third vessel on 26 April 2022. Joining the Isle of Inishmore and the Isle of Innisfree  this service now offers up to 30 sailings per day. Having commenced in June 2021  our service on Dover – Calais offers a genuine alternative for all users of the Channel Route. The Group also purchased a container vessel  the CT Pachuca  during the year. This brings the total number of container vessels owned by the Group to eight and upon delivery the vessel was chartered to Group subsidiary Eucon. During 2022  the Group took delivery of a further five remote control semi-automated electric RTG’s which brings the total number of electrically powered RTG’s at DFT to nine. Of the nine RTG’s  six are fully commissioned and in use with a further three to be commissioned during Q2 2023 continuing our transition to this more environmentally efficient mode of operation. The Group has also ordered one new electrically powered ship-to-shore crane (STS) for delivery in 2023. The deployment of these electric cranes puts us on track to meet our emissions reduction targets of net zero emissions by 2030. Belfast Container Terminal (BCT) operates the sole container terminal at Belfast under a services concession agreement with Belfast Harbour Commissioners (BHC) at a 27 acre site in Belfast Harbour. The £40 million re-investment project by BHC commenced in 2019 and continued into 2022. The project included extensive civil works and the delivery of two new ship-to-shore gantry cranes along with eight new electrically operated RTGs of which five are now in service. A further three RTG’s are scheduled to be commissioned in the second half of 2023. As per the investment in DFT  this investment is essential to reducing emissions in our terminal operations. The Group commenced operations at the new Dublin Inland Port in January 2022  under a 20 year lease agreement awarded following a public tender process. Trading as Dublin Ferryport Inland Depot (DFID)  this facility will be used for the remote storage  maintenance and upgrade of empty container boxes  releasing valuable capacity for the handling of containers in the port area. The Dublin Inland Port is located adjacent to Dublin Airport with direct access to the M50 Motorway (Dublin Ring Road) and Dublin Port via the Port Tunnel. Strategy and the Environment The Group is conscious that its activities have an environmental impact but is happy to note that reducing that impact aligns with our overall strategy. The Group has continued with the significant investments in installing exhaust gas cleaning systems (EGCS) and the ongoing program of electrification of heavy plant at our container terminals. Both of these investments  while reducing harmful emissions  also bring health and safety benefits to our operatives and align with the strategic objective of delivering sustained and profitable growth. This investment continued in 2022  including the commissioning of two additional electric cranes for our Dublin Ferryport Terminal. Three further electric RTG’s are on site and will be commissioned in 2023. The Group currently collects various data related to its environmental impact of its operations for external reporting purposes. In recognition of the powerful effect that data can have on creating awareness of individual actions  the Group collates and harnesses this data as a tool to promote environmental responsibility within the workforce. While we recognise that there is and always will be additional work to do in this space  we consider the ongoing improvement and progress together with the firm foundation established from prior years will enable the further development of our approach to sustainability  ESG and strong reporting in the years ahead. However  for certain aspects the Group will require the shipping sector as a whole to work together. This particularly relates to global regulation under the auspices of the International Maritime Organisation setting common standards and key equipment suppliers adopting the latest technologies. As a small operator in a global market  the Group will only apply proven technologies and we will recover the costs of same  either by increased efficiencies or by passing associated costs through to customers. The Group is aware that our stakeholders require us to be environmentally focused and the Group is committed to continuous improvement in everything that we do. Freight remains the backbone of the local Irish and European economies. Our efforts in greening the maritime industry is a vital part of moving the wider European economy to a sustainable footing in the face of the rising challenge from climate change. Current Trading and Outlook 2023 Trading to date 1/1/23 – 4/3/23 1/1/22 – 4/3/22 Change Volumes ‘000 ‘000 Cars 50.0 35.2 +42.0% RoRo freight units 111.9 92.4 +21.1% Containers shipped (teu) 53.7 56.2 (4.4%) Port lifts 51.9 55.0 (5.6%) We have experienced strong growth in car and RoRo freight volumes in 2022  due partly to the unwinding of Covid-19 restrictions and also due to the expansion of our services on the Dover – Calais route. Container volumes were down slightly as they are more impacted by the slowdown in world growth and international trade volumes. In the period from 1 January 2023 to 4 March 2023  Irish Ferries carried 50 000 cars  an increase of 42.0% over the same period in the prior year. While these increases are encouraging  it is over a seasonally less significant time of the year for passenger travel. We do see an opportunity for material growth in our passenger business with the expected return to pre-pandemic levels. RoRo volumes in the Ferries Division have also started strongly in 2023. Overall  Irish Ferries RoRo volumes are up 21.1% on the same period in the prior year to 111 900 RoRo units. We expect that 2023 sees a continuation of the trend of freight customers returning to the landbridge and we are hopeful that the Windsor Framework will remove the distortion from the non-implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol. We welcome recent calls for the establishment of Green lanes on ferry routes between the UK and the Republic of Ireland  for traffic destined for Northern Ireland. This will ensure freight moves on and off the island of Ireland in the most efficient  timely and environmentally friendly manner. The Container and Terminal Division has seen a reduction in containers shipped in the period from 1 January 2023 to 4 March 2023 of 4.4%. The number of terminal lifts has seen a similar drop of 5.6% in the same period. This is indicative of a slowdown in the global economy and is not unexpected. However  the recent and ongoing investment in capacity expansion for longer term growth and plant modernisation at our container terminals will provide a platform for both growth and more efficient operations at our Dublin terminal. This will be further aided by the operations at our new Dublin Inland Port facility which commenced during 2022. We note the ever-increasing expectations and regulatory requirements to reduce the effects of our operations on the environment. While the Group acknowledges that its operations have an inevitable impact on the environment it does so in the knowledge that it operates essential services from the island of Ireland  which was clearly evident during the worst of the Covid-19 lockdowns. Our maritime transport operations remain the most environmentally sustainable form of transport for facilitating trade and movement of goods and people on and off the island. Nevertheless  reducing our impact on the environment is embedded in the Group’s DNA through maximising the effectiveness and efficiency in our operations while continuing to invest in appropriate technologies to reduce our impact on the environment. While there is some uncertainty around economic growth rates  we look forward to continued growth during 2023 through the leveraging of our recent investments and the continued support of all customers.

Segmental information The Executive Board is deemed the chief operating decision maker within the Group. For management purposes  the Group is currently organised into two operating segments: Ferries and Container and Terminal. Revenue has been disaggregated into categories which reflect how the nature  amount  timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. As revenues are recognised over short time periods of no more than days  a key determinant to categorising revenues is whether they principally arise from a business to customer or a business to business relationship as this impacts directly on the uncertainty of cash flows. i) Revenue analysis By business segment: 2022 2021 €m €m Ferries Passenger 162.7 59.0 Freight 184.7 94.6 Charter and other 52.5 21.9 399.9 175.5 Container and Terminal Freight 221.5 174.0 Inter-segment revenue (36.5) (15.0) Total 584.9 334.5 By geographic origin of booking: 2022 2021 €m €m Ireland 202.4 135.6 United Kingdom 142.2 64.1 Netherlands 99.7 73.7 Belgium 47.7 36.7 France 20.2 4.5 Poland 18.8 4.5 Austria 10.8 0.8 Other 43.1 14.6 584.9 334.5 No single external customer in the current or prior financial year amounted to 10 per cent of the Group’s revenues. ii) Profit / (loss) for the financial yearFerries Container & Terminal Group Total 2022€m 2021€m 2022€m 2021€m 2022€m 2021€m Operating profit / (loss) 46.4 (17.4) 20.3 17.2 66.7 (0.2) Finance income 0.1 - - 0.1 0.1 0.1 Finance costs (3.1) (2.0) (1.2) (2.0) (4.3) (4.0) Profit / (loss) before tax 43.4 (19.4) 19.1 15.3 62.5 (4.1) Income tax expense (1.3) (0.1) (1.4) (0.7) (2.7) (0.8) Profit / (loss) for the financial year 42.1 (19.5) 17.7 14.6 59.8 (4.9) iii) Other operating expensesFerries Container & Terminal Group Total 2022€m 2021€m 2022€m 2021€m 2022€m 2021€m Fuel 104.6 43.1 19.4 12.0 124.0 55.1 Labour 48.3 28.7 12.6 9.7 60.9 38.4 Port costs 69.0 44.0 35.2 33.7 104.2 77.7 Haulage - - 56.6 50.0 56.6 50.0 Other 61.3 20.7 60.4 34.5 121.7 55.2 Inter-segment (1.2) (1.2) (35.3) (13.8) (36.5) (15.0) Other operating expenses 282.0 135.3 148.9 126.1 430.9 261.4 iv) Statement of Financial Position Ferries Container & Terminal Group Total 2022€m 2021€m 2022€m 2021€m 2022€m 2021€m Assets Segment assets 422.5 367.0 112.4 106.4 534.9 473.4 Cash and cash equivalents 34.5 29.9 4.5 8.6 39.0 38.5 Consolidated total assets 457.0 396.9 116.9 115.0 573.9 511.9 Liabilities Segment liabilities 66.7 49.8 36.3 31.7 103.0 81.5 Borrowings and lease liabilities 174.6 140.0 35.5 40.7 210.1 180.7 Consolidated total liabilities 241.3 189.8 71.8 72.4 313.1 262.2 3. Income tax expense 2022 2021 €m €m Current tax 2.7 0.7 Deferred tax - 0.1Income tax expense for the year 2.7 0.8 The Company and its Irish tax resident subsidiaries  where appropriate  have elected to be taxed under the Irish tonnage tax method. Under the tonnage tax method  taxable profit on eligible activities is calculated on a specified notional profit per day related to the tonnage of the vessels utilised. In accordance with the IFRIC guidance on IAS 12 Income Taxes  the tonnage tax charge is not considered an income tax expense and has been included in other operating expenses in the Consolidated Income Statement. Domestic income tax is calculated at 12.5% of the estimated assessable profit for the year for all activities which do not fall to be taxed under the tonnage tax system. Taxation for other jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in the relevant jurisdictions. The income tax expense for the year includes a current tax charge of €2.7 million (2021: €0.7 million) and a deferred tax charge of €nil million (2021: €0.1 million. The total expense for the year is reconciled to the accounting profit as follows: 2022 2021 €m €m Profit / (loss) before tax 62.5 (4.1) Tax at the domestic income tax rate of 12.5% (2021: 12.5%) 7.8 - Losses not eligible for surrender under loss provisions - 2.4 Effect of tonnage relief (6.6) (2.2) Difference in effective tax rates 0.3 0.8 Other items 1.2 (0.2)Income tax expense recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement 2.7 0.8 4.

Where the performance conditions have been met at the end of the performance period and the awards remain unexercised  they are no longer treated as contingently issuable and are treated as issued shares from the end of the performance period and included in the weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purpose of basic earnings per share. Those contingently issuable shares for which the performance period has not yet expired  are included in the weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purposes of diluted earnings per share unless the performance conditions governing their exercisability have not been met at the reporting date. A total of 664 484 (2021: 3 646 828) unvested share options outstanding at the reporting date have been excluded from the weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purposes of diluted earnings per share as they were either antidilutive or had not met the performance conditions governing their exercisability. The earnings used in both the adjusted basic and adjusted diluted earnings per share are adjusted to take into account the net interest on defined benefit obligations and the effect of non-trading items after tax. The calculation of the basic and diluted earnings per share attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent is based on the following data: 2022 2021 Earnings €m €m Earnings for the purpose of basic and diluted earnings per share – Profit / (loss) for the financial period attributable to equity holders of the parent 59.8 (4.9) Effect of net interest income on defined benefit assets (0.1) (0.1) Earnings for the purpose of adjusted basic and adjusted diluted earnings per share59.7(5.0) Cent Cent Basic earnings per share 33.6 (2.6) Diluted earnings per share 33.2 (2.6) Adjusted basic earnings per share 33.6 (2.7) Adjusted diluted earnings per share 33.1 (2.7) 5.
