Provided that the AGM votes in favor of this proposal  the dividend is expected to be sent out via Euroclear on Monday  April 24  2023.Long-term share savings programBackgroundSince 2012 the AGMs have resolved on the implementation of long-term share saving programs for employees of the company. The terms of the share savings program (the “Program”) now proposed by the Board of Directors to the 2023 AGM corresponds to the program adopted by the 2022 AGM. Industrivärden’s long-term share savings programs that are outstanding and were completed during the year are presented in more detail in Note 8 of the Annual Report 2022.The Program entails that the employee after three years receives so-called performance shares  provided that certain conditions are fulfilled and that the employee has invested a portion of his or her base salary in Industrivärden shares and that the employee has not given  or been served  notice of termination during the Lock-in Period (as defined in item d below).The purpose of the Program is to encourage Industrivärden’s employees to increase their shareholdings and thereby further emphasize long-term shareholder value. The share savings program is deemed to increase Industrivärden’s prospects for retaining and recruiting competent employees as well as the employees’ interest and involvement in Industrivärden’s business and development. The performance conditions  which are based on the total return for Industrivärden shares during the term of the Program  are deemed to further enhance the participants’ long-term commitment and the mutual interests between Industrivärden’s shareholders and employees. The Program is intended to be annually recurring and constitute the form of long-term variable remuneration.The Board of Directors thus proposes that the 2023 AGM resolve to implement a long-term share savings program for in total no more than 20 employees of Industrivärden.The Board of Directors’ proposal for resolutionThe Board of Directors proposes that the AGM resolve to implement the Program based on the terms and conditions set out below.a. The Program is open to the CEO and a maximum of 4 other members of Industrivärden’s management (“CEO” and “Management” respectively)  to a maximum of 6 key persons employed by Industrivärden (“Key Persons”)  and to other permanent employees of Industrivärden (“Employees”)  however in total a maximum of 20 permanent employees of Industrivärden.b. Provided that the CEO  Management  Key Persons and Employees (as applicable) have made an own investment in Class C shares in Industrivärden (“Savings Shares”) during the Acquisition Period (defined in item c below)  such participant is under the terms of the Program offered the opportunity to be granted shares free of charge  from a designated third party at the end of the Lock-in Period  as follows:(i) Provided that the total return for the Industrivärden Class C shares during the Lock-in Period is equal to or exceeds 10 percent  all program participants may be granted 0.5 Class C shares in Industrivärden (“Performance Share”) per Savings Share (ii) Provided that the average annual total return for Industrivärden Class C shares during the Lock-in Period is equal to or exceeds SIXRX during the same period of time  the CEO and Management may be granted 1 additional Performance Share  Key Persons may be granted 0.5 additional Performance Share  and Employees may be granted 0.5 additional Performance Share  per Savings Share (iii) Provided that the average annual total return for Industrivärden Class C shares during the Lock-in Period exceeds SIXRX by 2 percentage points during the same period of time  the CEO and Management may be granted 1.5 additional Performance Shares and Key Persons may be granted 1 additional Performance Share per Savings Share  and(iv) Provided that the average annual total return for Industrivärden Class C shares during the Lock-in Period exceeds SIXRX by 3 percentage points during the same period of time  the CEO may be granted 1 additional Performance Share per Savings share.In total  the Program thus entails that the CEO may be granted 4 Performance Shares per Savings Share  that Management may be granted 3 Performance Shares per Savings Share  that Key Persons may be granted 2 Performance Shares per Savings Share  and that Employees may be granted 1 Performance Share per Savings Share.c. The maximum number of Savings Shares that each program participant may acquire is limited in such way that Savings Shares may be acquired for an amount corresponding to a maximum of 10 percent of the participant’s gross annual base salary for 2023. Acquisition of Savings Shares shall take place during the period from 21 July 2023 until and including 31 October 2023  however with a right for the Board of Directors to extend the period in certain circumstances (the “Acquisition Period”).d. Grants of Performance Shares are expected to take place shortly after publication of Industrivärden’s third quarter interim report for 2026. The time from the last day of the Acquisition Period to the date of publication of Industrivärden’s third quarter interim report for 2026 is defined as the “Lock-in Period”.e. In order for a program participant to be granted Performance Shares it is required that  with certain specific exemptions  the participant has not given  or been served  notice of termination of employment in Industrivärden during the Lock-in Period and that the participant  throughout the Lock-in Period  has retained the Savings Shares. Saving Shares disposed of prior to the expiration of the Lock-in Period will therefore not entitle to any grants of Performance Shares. Should a program participant retire during the Lock-in Period  the entitlement to receive allotment of Performance Shares shall be reduced in proportion to the time remaining in the Lock-in Period.f. The Program shall comprise a maximum of 50 000 Class C shares in Industrivärden. Should Savings Shares be acquired at a share price such that the total number of Performance Shares exceeds 50 000  the number of Performance Shares that may be transferred to the program participants will be proportionally reduced.g. The Board of Directors shall be authorized to establish the detailed terms and conditions for the Program.h. In the event significant changes occur in Industrivärden or the market  or in the event the costs for the Program significantly exceed the estimated costs  and this  in the opinion of the Board of Directors  results in a situation where the conditions for grants of Performance Shares under the Program become unreasonable  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to make adjustments to the Program  including  among other things  a decision to reduce the grant of Performance Shares or to not grant any Performance Shares at all.i. The number of Performance Shares shall be subject to recalculation as a result of intervening bonus issues  splits  rights issues and/or other similar company events.Drafting of the proposalThe proposal regarding the Program to the 2023 AGM has been decided on by the Board of Directors following preparation by the Compensation Committee.Hedging  etc.To hedge the financial exposure that the Program is expected to have  the Board of Directors intends to enter into a share swap agreement with a third party on behalf of Industrivärden  at market terms  whereby the third party in its own name shall be entitled to acquire and transfer Class C shares in Industrivärden to the program participants.As proposed the Program may comprise a maximum of 50 000 Class C shares in Industrivärden  representing approximately 0.01 percent of all outstanding shares in Industrivärden and approximately 0.03 percent of all outstanding Class C shares in Industrivärden.In accordance with the scope of the Program as described above  the cost upon full grant is estimated to approximately SEK 13 million  under the assumption all employees participate in the Program and that all program participants acquire the maximum number of Savings Shares.The Program is expected to have only marginal effect on Industrivärden’s and the Industrivärden Group’s key ratios.Majority requirementsThe AGM’s resolution in accordance with the above requires a majority of more than half of the votes cast.Nominating Committee’s proposalsThe Nominating Committee has consisted of Bo Damberg (Jan Wallanders and Tom Hedelius Foundation and others)  Mats Guldbrand (L E Lundbergföretagen)  Fredrik Lundberg (Chairman of the Board of AB Industrivärden)  Mikael Schmidt (Essity Pension Foundations and others)  and Jan Svedjebrant (SCA Pension Foundations and others).

The authorization may be used for the implementation of long-term incentive plans for the members of the Board of Directors  management and the personnel of the Company. The authorization can also be used for incentive arrangements and payment of the Board fees. Authorizations do not revoke previously granted authorizations on the issuance of shares and the issuance of special rights entitling to shares. 17 AMENDING THE ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION The Board of Directors proposes that an addition be made to the Articles of Association regarding participation in the general meeting via remote connection or completely without a physical meeting place in accordance with Chapter 5 § 16 of the Companies Act (21 July 2006/624).

The terms of the share savings program (the “Program”) now proposed by the Board of Directors to the 2023 AGM corresponds to the program adopted by the 2022 AGM. Industrivärden’s long-term share savings programs that are outstanding and were completed during the year are presented in more detail in Note 8 of the Annual Report 2022.The Program entails that the employee after three years receives so-called performance shares  provided that certain conditions are fulfilled and that the employee has invested a portion of his or her base salary in Industrivärden shares and that the employee has not given  or been served  notice of termination during the Lock-in Period (as defined in item d below).The purpose of the Program is to encourage Industrivärden’s employees to increase their shareholdings and thereby further emphasize long-term shareholder value. The share savings program is deemed to increase Industrivärden’s prospects for retaining and recruiting competent employees as well as the employees’ interest and involvement in Industrivärden’s business and development. The performance conditions  which are based on the total return for Industrivärden shares during the term of the Program  are deemed to further enhance the participants’ long-term commitment and the mutual interests between Industrivärden’s shareholders and employees. The Program is intended to be annually recurring and constitute the form of long-term variable remuneration.The Board of Directors thus proposes that the 2023 AGM resolve to implement a long-term share savings program for in total no more than 20 employees of Industrivärden.The Board of Directors’ proposal for resolutionThe Board of Directors proposes that the AGM resolve to implement the Program based on the terms and conditions set out below.a. The Program is open to the CEO and a maximum of 4 other members of Industrivärden’s management (“CEO” and “Management” respectively)  to a maximum of 6 key persons employed by Industrivärden (“Key Persons”)  and to other permanent employees of Industrivärden (“Employees”)  however in total a maximum of 20 permanent employees of Industrivärden.b. Provided that the CEO  Management  Key Persons and Employees (as applicable) have made an own investment in Class C shares in Industrivärden (“Savings Shares”) during the Acquisition Period (defined in item c below)  such participant is under the terms of the Program offered the opportunity to be granted shares free of charge  from a designated third party at the end of the Lock-in Period  as follows:(i) Provided that the total return for the Industrivärden Class C shares during the Lock-in Period is equal to or exceeds 10 percent  all program participants may be granted 0.5 Class C shares in Industrivärden (“Performance Share”) per Savings Share (ii) Provided that the average annual total return for Industrivärden Class C shares during the Lock-in Period is equal to or exceeds SIXRX during the same period of time  the CEO and Management may be granted 1 additional Performance Share  Key Persons may be granted 0.5 additional Performance Share  and Employees may be granted 0.5 additional Performance Share  per Savings Share (iii) Provided that the average annual total return for Industrivärden Class C shares during the Lock-in Period exceeds SIXRX by 2 percentage points during the same period of time  the CEO and Management may be granted 1.5 additional Performance Shares and Key Persons may be granted 1 additional Performance Share per Savings Share  and(iv) Provided that the average annual total return for Industrivärden Class C shares during the Lock-in Period exceeds SIXRX by 3 percentage points during the same period of time  the CEO may be granted 1 additional Performance Share per Savings share.In total  the Program thus entails that the CEO may be granted 4 Performance Shares per Savings Share  that Management may be granted 3 Performance Shares per Savings Share  that Key Persons may be granted 2 Performance Shares per Savings Share  and that Employees may be granted 1 Performance Share per Savings Share.c. The maximum number of Savings Shares that each program participant may acquire is limited in such way that Savings Shares may be acquired for an amount corresponding to a maximum of 10 percent of the participant’s gross annual base salary for 2023. Acquisition of Savings Shares shall take place during the period from 21 July 2023 until and including 31 October 2023  however with a right for the Board of Directors to extend the period in certain circumstances (the “Acquisition Period”).d. Grants of Performance Shares are expected to take place shortly after publication of Industrivärden’s third quarter interim report for 2026. The time from the last day of the Acquisition Period to the date of publication of Industrivärden’s third quarter interim report for 2026 is defined as the “Lock-in Period”.e. In order for a program participant to be granted Performance Shares it is required that  with certain specific exemptions  the participant has not given  or been served  notice of termination of employment in Industrivärden during the Lock-in Period and that the participant  throughout the Lock-in Period  has retained the Savings Shares. Saving Shares disposed of prior to the expiration of the Lock-in Period will therefore not entitle to any grants of Performance Shares. Should a program participant retire during the Lock-in Period  the entitlement to receive allotment of Performance Shares shall be reduced in proportion to the time remaining in the Lock-in Period.f. The Program shall comprise a maximum of 50 000 Class C shares in Industrivärden. Should Savings Shares be acquired at a share price such that the total number of Performance Shares exceeds 50 000  the number of Performance Shares that may be transferred to the program participants will be proportionally reduced.g. The Board of Directors shall be authorized to establish the detailed terms and conditions for the Program.h.

Provided that the AGM votes in favor of this proposal  the dividend is expected to be sent out via Euroclear on Monday  April 24  2023.Long-term share savings programBackgroundSince 2012 the AGMs have resolved on the implementation of long-term share saving programs for employees of the company. The terms of the share savings program (the “Program”) now proposed by the Board of Directors to the 2023 AGM corresponds to the program adopted by the 2022 AGM. Industrivärden’s long-term share savings programs that are outstanding and were completed during the year are presented in more detail in Note 8 of the Annual Report 2022.The Program entails that the employee after three years receives so-called performance shares  provided that certain conditions are fulfilled and that the employee has invested a portion of his or her base salary in Industrivärden shares and that the employee has not given  or been served  notice of termination during the Lock-in Period (as defined in item d below).The purpose of the Program is to encourage Industrivärden’s employees to increase their shareholdings and thereby further emphasize long-term shareholder value. The share savings program is deemed to increase Industrivärden’s prospects for retaining and recruiting competent employees as well as the employees’ interest and involvement in Industrivärden’s business and development. The performance conditions  which are based on the total return for Industrivärden shares during the term of the Program  are deemed to further enhance the participants’ long-term commitment and the mutual interests between Industrivärden’s shareholders and employees. The Program is intended to be annually recurring and constitute the form of long-term variable remuneration.The Board of Directors thus proposes that the 2023 AGM resolve to implement a long-term share savings program for in total no more than 20 employees of Industrivärden.The Board of Directors’ proposal for resolutionThe Board of Directors proposes that the AGM resolve to implement the Program based on the terms and conditions set out below.a. The Program is open to the CEO and a maximum of 4 other members of Industrivärden’s management (“CEO” and “Management” respectively)  to a maximum of 6 key persons employed by Industrivärden (“Key Persons”)  and to other permanent employees of Industrivärden (“Employees”)  however in total a maximum of 20 permanent employees of Industrivärden.b. Provided that the CEO  Management  Key Persons and Employees (as applicable) have made an own investment in Class C shares in Industrivärden (“Savings Shares”) during the Acquisition Period (defined in item c below)  such participant is under the terms of the Program offered the opportunity to be granted shares free of charge  from a designated third party at the end of the Lock-in Period  as follows:(i) Provided that the total return for the Industrivärden Class C shares during the Lock-in Period is equal to or exceeds 10 percent  all program participants may be granted 0.5 Class C shares in Industrivärden (“Performance Share”) per Savings Share (ii) Provided that the average annual total return for Industrivärden Class C shares during the Lock-in Period is equal to or exceeds SIXRX during the same period of time  the CEO and Management may be granted 1 additional Performance Share  Key Persons may be granted 0.5 additional Performance Share  and Employees may be granted 0.5 additional Performance Share  per Savings Share (iii) Provided that the average annual total return for Industrivärden Class C shares during the Lock-in Period exceeds SIXRX by 2 percentage points during the same period of time  the CEO and Management may be granted 1.5 additional Performance Shares and Key Persons may be granted 1 additional Performance Share per Savings Share  and(iv) Provided that the average annual total return for Industrivärden Class C shares during the Lock-in Period exceeds SIXRX by 3 percentage points during the same period of time  the CEO may be granted 1 additional Performance Share per Savings share.In total  the Program thus entails that the CEO may be granted 4 Performance Shares per Savings Share  that Management may be granted 3 Performance Shares per Savings Share  that Key Persons may be granted 2 Performance Shares per Savings Share  and that Employees may be granted 1 Performance Share per Savings Share.c. The maximum number of Savings Shares that each program participant may acquire is limited in such way that Savings Shares may be acquired for an amount corresponding to a maximum of 10 percent of the participant’s gross annual base salary for 2023. Acquisition of Savings Shares shall take place during the period from 21 July 2023 until and including 31 October 2023  however with a right for the Board of Directors to extend the period in certain circumstances (the “Acquisition Period”).d. Grants of Performance Shares are expected to take place shortly after publication of Industrivärden’s third quarter interim report for 2026. The time from the last day of the Acquisition Period to the date of publication of Industrivärden’s third quarter interim report for 2026 is defined as the “Lock-in Period”.e. In order for a program participant to be granted Performance Shares it is required that  with certain specific exemptions  the participant has not given  or been served  notice of termination of employment in Industrivärden during the Lock-in Period and that the participant  throughout the Lock-in Period  has retained the Savings Shares. Saving Shares disposed of prior to the expiration of the Lock-in Period will therefore not entitle to any grants of Performance Shares. Should a program participant retire during the Lock-in Period  the entitlement to receive allotment of Performance Shares shall be reduced in proportion to the time remaining in the Lock-in Period.f. The Program shall comprise a maximum of 50 000 Class C shares in Industrivärden. Should Savings Shares be acquired at a share price such that the total number of Performance Shares exceeds 50 000  the number of Performance Shares that may be transferred to the program participants will be proportionally reduced.g. The Board of Directors shall be authorized to establish the detailed terms and conditions for the Program.h. In the event significant changes occur in Industrivärden or the market  or in the event the costs for the Program significantly exceed the estimated costs  and this  in the opinion of the Board of Directors  results in a situation where the conditions for grants of Performance Shares under the Program become unreasonable  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to make adjustments to the Program  including  among other things  a decision to reduce the grant of Performance Shares or to not grant any Performance Shares at all.i. The number of Performance Shares shall be subject to recalculation as a result of intervening bonus issues  splits  rights issues and/or other similar company events.Drafting of the proposalThe proposal regarding the Program to the 2023 AGM has been decided on by the Board of Directors following preparation by the Compensation Committee.Hedging  etc.To hedge the financial exposure that the Program is expected to have  the Board of Directors intends to enter into a share swap agreement with a third party on behalf of Industrivärden  at market terms  whereby the third party in its own name shall be entitled to acquire and transfer Class C shares in Industrivärden to the program participants.As proposed the Program may comprise a maximum of 50 000 Class C shares in Industrivärden  representing approximately 0.01 percent of all outstanding shares in Industrivärden and approximately 0.03 percent of all outstanding Class C shares in Industrivärden.In accordance with the scope of the Program as described above  the cost upon full grant is estimated to approximately SEK 13 million  under the assumption all employees participate in the Program and that all program participants acquire the maximum number of Savings Shares.The Program is expected to have only marginal effect on Industrivärden’s and the Industrivärden Group’s key ratios.Majority requirementsThe AGM’s resolution in accordance with the above requires a majority of more than half of the votes cast.Nominating Committee’s proposalsThe Nominating Committee has consisted of Bo Damberg (Jan Wallanders and Tom Hedelius Foundation and others)  Mats Guldbrand (L E Lundbergföretagen)  Fredrik Lundberg (Chairman of the Board of AB Industrivärden)  Mikael Schmidt (Essity Pension Foundations and others)  and Jan Svedjebrant (SCA Pension Foundations and others).

Transfer of shares shall be made free of charge at the time for  and according to the terms for  the allotment of shares to participants in Share Saving Plan 2024-2027. The number of shares that may be transferred under Share Saving Plan 2024-2027 may be recalculated due to any intervening split or reverse share split  bonus issue  preferential issue and/or similar corporate actions. The reason for deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights is to enable the company to transfer Performance Shares to the participants in Share Saving Plan 2024-2027. Shares that have been acquired by the company  and which are not transferred to participants in the Share Saving Plan 2024-2027 may be transferred to participants in previous share saving plans or future share saving plans decided on by the General Meeting of the company. Also such shares acquired by the company within previous years' share saving plans may be transferred to participants in the Share Saving Plan 2024-2027  previous share saving plans or future share saving plans decided on by the General Meeting. Transfer shall take place in accordance with applicable rules for the current share saving plan. Estimated costsThe program will generate costs related to the application of IFRS 2 “Share-related remuneration” amounting to approximately MSEK 26 and costs for social security contributions of approximately MSEK 9 for the shares which are allotted free of charge. The total effect on the income statement is estimated to amount to approximately MSEK 35  distributed over the years 2024-2027. Costs according to IFRS 2 do not affect the cash flow or equity during the duration of the Share Saving Plan. The acquisition cost of the shares is estimated to approximately MSEK 26 and will affect the cash flow and equity in connection with acquisition of the shares. The social security contributions effect the equity continuously  but the cash flow only in 2028  after that the shares has been allotted. Administrative costs for the program are estimated to amount to MSEK 0.8 during the duration of the program. The above cost-estimate is based on assumptions that just over half of the employees participate in the program  that all participants remain until the end of the program  an investment level per participant based on historical outcome and a maximum outcome on the performance conditions corresponding to two (2) Performance Shares per Saving Share. For the share price at the end of the program  a development corresponding to the outcome of the performance condition earnings per share has been assumed. Reason for the proposalThe Board of Directors’ reason for the abovementioned proposal on Share Saving Plan 2024-2027 is that a personal long-term owner commitment in the company by the employees is expected to stimulate an increased interest for the company’s operation and earnings  and to increase the motivation and affinity with the company. The offering and participation in the Share Saving Plan shall be considered as a part of the total remuneration package. Therefore  the Board of Directors assesses that the Share Saving Plan is favourably for both the company and its shareholders. It is the Board of Directors’ intention to annually return to the Annual General Meeting with proposals for share saving plans with equivalent conditions and effects. In case the conditions for the assumptions on number of employees that may be offered to participate in the share saving program or otherwise that is the basis for the calculations of the maximum size of the program change  the Board of Directors’ intends to return with a supplementary proposal to the Annual General Meeting 2024 regarding repurchase and transfer of own shares within Share Saving Plan 2024-2027  in order to ensure that all employees as per 31 December 2023 who wish to participate in the program can do so. Effects on key ratiosAs per the date of the Board of Directors’ proposal  the number of shares in the company amounts to 46 818 868. The Share Saving Plan 2024-2027 is expected to result in acquisition and transfer of a total of approximately 70 000 shares  which corresponds to approximately 0.15% of the total number of outstanding shares and votes. The key ratio earnings per share is not expected to be affected substantially. Majority resolutionDecision on the Board of Directors’ proposal under items A  B and C shall be made as a joint decision. The proposal  to be valid  must be supported by shareholders holding at least nine-tenths of both the number of votes cast  as well as of the number of shares represented at the meeting. Shareholders’ right to receive informationThe Board of Directors and CEO shall at the Annual General Meeting  if any shareholder so requests and the Board of Directors believes that it can be done without material harm to the company  provide information regarding circumstances that may affect the assessment of an item on the agenda  circumstances that may affect the assessment of the company’s or its subsidiaries’ financial situation and the company’s relation to another company within the group.

Each Saving Share entitles the participant to receive free of charge a maximum of two (2) shares in the company  based on the achievement of certain performance conditions (“Performance Share”).

Transfer of own shares to participants in the Share Saving Plan 2024-2027To be able to deliver Performance Shares under Share Saving Plan 2024-2027  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves on transfer of own shares in accordance with the following conditions:A maximum number of 70 000 shares may be transferred free of charge to participants in Share Saving Plan 2024-2027.

The idea that the end of history had arrived has been shattered.As we entered 2023  we witnessed certain stocks soaring in the markets  attempting to recover from their previous losses  while other macroeconomic indicators continued to deteriorate. However  uncertainty still weighs heavily on the minds of investors  perhaps even more so than ever before  given the threats of inflation  labor market instability  dollarization pitfalls  trust decay in central banks and financial institutions  interest rates  potential real estate crash in specific local areas…A significant question raises: how to protect ourselves against such circumstances and what can we expect in each possible scenario?Therefore  it presents a fantastic opportunity to brush up our R  tidy & ggplot  skills and delve further into the market structure. Through this series of posts  we are primarily examining the stock market  its dynamics  cycles  valuation metrics  as well as the pre-IPO and startup ecosystem  the bond market  real estate  and even a touch of crypto. However  as you’ll see  we are mainly deepening our understanding of value/fundamentals-focused investing strategies.What is value investing? Value investing is an investment strategy that involves buying stocks or other financial assets that are believed to be undervalued by the market  focusing in their intrinsic value. The ultimate goal of value investing then  is to identify companies that are temporarily undervalued by the market due to factors such as short-term negative news  volatility  or even investor sentiment. By buying these assets at a discounted price  value investors hope to profit from the market’s eventual recognition of the company’s true value  resulting in a higher stock price. So we are far in this series from the high frequency  short-term or daily trades. Although  it’s a quite prolific and profitable field  also an interesting intersection between Data Science and Finance 😉 The approach  skills and even the involved risks are quite different from one way to trade to other. The value investing approach could also be seen or performed as a defensive strategy  not as greedy as other ones. But it also involves long-term and macroeconomic risks that are not present (or have less impact) in short-to-medium term strategies.Generating Financial Market Prep free API key To start  we need to access the data. There are many options for doing so  one of which is to create an API token in the Financial Market Prep page. The available data on this API continues to grow month after month. Truth be told  some functionalities could be improved  such as allowing for more parameterization in data retrieval. Nevertheless  the sheer amount and quality of the data available is just stunning  which is why we are using it throughout this series. Select the free plan. Then we’ll come back and set up the API key in your R environment. library(tidyverse) library(ggplot2) library(ggthemes) library(magrittr) library(lubridate) library(factoextra) library(fmpcloudr) fmpc_set_token('your_token') # example fmpc_set_token('09431214923a63117b0p00ff1cart2alp') Now the token is already set up  so we can start downloading data. As in March 2023  you can do 250 call to the free API. In this post we are exploring the API and doing the first plotsFinancial Market Prep API in fmpcloudr package As you have seen  they also have a very handy R package  fmpcloudr . In this paragraph we are briefly exploring the kind of data available.

Sentiment data not available in the R package. So we have to construct the GET call. We are showing how in next posts and opening a PR to their package.

Such and awesome collection of data! 😀 And it’s probably enough (with the free tier) to start to analyze and even slow trade in a more value investing way. More information in their documentationMarket Capitalization in R As promised  we are just introducing the package and brushing up our ggplot skills. Therefore  we are focusing in this post on the evolution of market cap  allowing us to compare trends between different stocks. It is well known that growth stocks have experienced a massive surge in recent years  ranging from technology growth companies to pump-and-dump penny stocks  ‘meme-stocks’ defying the establishment (good luck Credit Suisse  SVB..) and SPACs frenzy. The market has been flooded with free money for almost a decade  with tech players lowering the entry barriers for retail investors  and benefiting from lockdown savings and subsidies. Let’s examine the impact of this phenomenon on a set of stocks categorized as ‘growth’ and ‘value’. Since life is a continuum  we will first categorize them by hand according to the consensus. We will then conduct an initial analysis  which will be elaborated further in subsequent posts  attempting to cluster them based on their actual performance. In this chapter  we will use the market cap fluctuation to achieve this  although other features could also be utilized and macroeconomic factors taken into account. Stay tuned for upcoming TypeThePipe posts! symbols = c('AAPL'  'META'  'AMZN'  'GOOG' 'MSFT') data <- fmpcloudr::fmpc_security_mrktcap(symbols  limit = 30*12*12) data %<>% mutate(date = ymd(date)) ggplot(data  aes(date  marketCap  colour = symbol)) + geom_line()Financial Times Theme in Ggplot Not bad for a 2 lines plot  but lets add some Financial Times theme kind of flavor: # old chunk in my codebase seen in Reddit but and can't find the source.

Time series clustering is a very controversial topic. Therefore we are skipping it during this first introductory post  and we are using a simple clustering based on simple stats: daily return (approximated using the already downloaded market cap delta) and volatility. data_basic_stats <- data %>% filter(date>='2023-01-01') %>% group_by(symbol) %>% mutate(lag_mktcap = lag(marketCap order_by = date)  diff = (marketCap - lag_mktcap) /lag_mktcap * 100) %>% summarise_at(.vars = 'diff'  c(funs(mean(.  na.rm = TRUE))  funs(sd(.  na.rm = TRUE)))) data_value_basic_stats <- data_value %>% filter(date>='2023-01-01') %>% group_by(symbol) %>% mutate(lag_mktcap = lag(marketCap order_by = date)  diff = (marketCap - lag_mktcap) /lag_mktcap * 100) %>% summarise_at(.vars = 'diff'  c(funs(mean(.  na.rm = TRUE))  funs(sd(.  na.rm = TRUE)))) Since we are only examining the dataset and it only has two dimensions  we opt to use the straightforward elbow method to select 3 clusters. However  we could also try with 2 and 4 clusters to compare the outcomes. data_stats <- data_basic_stats %>% bind_rows(data_value_basic_stats) tot_withinss <- map_dbl(2:5  function(k) { model <- kmeans(data_stats %>% select(mean  sd)  centers = k) model$tot.withinss }) data.frame(k = 2:5  tot_withinss = tot_withinss) %>% ggplot(aes(x = k  y = tot_withinss)) + geom_line() + scale_x_continuous(breaks = 2:5) fit = kmeans(data_stats %>% select(mean  sd)  3) data_stats %<>% mutate(cluster = fit$cluster  cluster_mean = fit$centers[cluster 1]  cluster_sd = fit$centers[cluster 2]  ) In the field of economics  there is a tendency to apply discrete categories  often based on historical but arbitrary thresholds  such as recession / not recession  stagflation  growth stocks versus value stocks… We should go beyond basic KPIs and try to approximate underlaying factors driving the markets. Throughout this series  we will strive to analyze and categorize data in a way that reflects richer and higher-dimensional information. ggplot(data_stats  aes(mean  sd  colour=factor(cluster))) + geom_point() + geom_label(aes(label = symbol)  size=3  label.r = unit(5  'points')) + guides(colour=FALSE) We can easily expand our analysis to other stocks. Let’s discover how to do so in using the Financial Market Prep API and R package  and in next post we’ll elaborate on those ts clusterization methods  common patterns  turning points… total_tickers <- fmpc_symbols_available() total_tickers$exchangeShortName %>% unique() %>% head(20) ## [1] ""MCX"" ""NSE"" ""STO"" ""HEL"" ""CPH"" ""NASDAQ"" ## [7] ""TAL"" ""CBT"" ""EURONEXT"" ""LSE"" ""IST"" ""VIE"" ## [13] ""JNB"" ""MIL"" ""XETRA"" ""AMS"" ""PRA"" ""BSE"" ## [19] ""LIS"" ""OSE"" list_symbols <- total_tickers %>% filter(exchangeShortName=='NYSE') %>% pull(symbol) This APi call provides quite a lot (all) of them! data <- fmpcloudr::fmpc_security_mrktcap(list_symbols  limit = 30*3) We now have the capability to conduct the analysis on the entire NYSE  or at least the most highly capitalized stocks. But that will be another day ;) For now  we can see again a decay in the value stocks in these two first months of 2023 vs the growth ones. The market has once again received a dose of optimism. Could it be a good option to start/continue a DCA strategy? Perhaps its suitability varies based on industry and current valuation? Most likely  it does. We are extending this analysis and talking about valuation metrics in our second post of the series!

Over the past quarters  the Company has been facing operational issues as well as market headwinds. To better seize market opportunities and strengthen Technicolor Creative Studios’ leading positions  the Company took a series of concrete measures through the Re*Imagined program. I am convinced that our strong position in this industry  a new reinforced leadership structure  together with ambitious operational initiatives  and now a reinforced capital structure will set Technicolor Creative Studios back on its journey towards sustainable and profitable growth. In addition  the Company will leverage its unique technological expertise  deep and long-standing customer relationships  and the world’s best talents. I would like to express my utmost gratitude to all Technicolor Creative Studios teams  who have demonstrated relentless commitment towards delivering extraordinary work to our clients. The whole industry continues to rely on our award-winning creativity and expertise to deliver our clients’ visions and additional projects. I would also like to thank our key creditors and shareholders for their renewed confidence with the recent signing of an agreement in principle on the refinancing of the Company. In conjunction with the improvement actions initiated through the Re*imagined program  this will improve the Company’s balance sheet and profitability  re-establishing its market leading position. “ TECHNICOLOR CREATIVE STUDIOS RECENT KEY EVOLUTIONS As announced on March 8  2023  Technicolor Creative Studios has reached an agreement in principle with a large majority of shareholders and lenders on a new financing structure which includes a c.€170 million new money injection. The refinancing would also reduce the financial liabilities of the business by reducing cash interest across all instruments as well as by subordinating €170 million and converting €30 million of existing debt into equity. A part of this new money financing would be made by end of March / beginning of April 2023  subject to finalization of the relevant documentation and satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set out therein. The remaining part of the c.€170 million new money financing is expected to be made available by the end of Q2 2023. The Agreement in Principle would therefore enable Technicolor Creative Studios to address its liquidity needs from Q2 2023 and allows operating cash flow to be focused on operational needs and would be combined with an evolution of the Company’s governance to be further detailed upon finalization of the conciliation protocol. Technicolor Creative Studios and its shareholders and lenders will pursue the implementation of the Agreement in Principle  which will be submitted for approval to the Commercial Court of Paris by the end of March.For further information on the Agreement in Principle  please refer to the press release dated March 8  2023 available at the following address: https://www.technicolorcreative.com/investor-center/. RESUMPTION OF TRADING ON MARCH 10  2023 UPON MARKET OPENING Following the suspension on March 8  2023  the trading of the shares issued by Technicolor Creative Studios will resume on this Friday 10 March 2023  at the market opening. FORWARD LOOKING ASSUMPTIONS Demand for VFX and original content remains strong  and the industry is recognizing Technicolor Creative Studios for the high quality work its studios are delivering. However  this demand for original content is facing a VFX production capacity still impacted by unprecedented post-Covid recovery challenges and corresponding operational issues. As a consequence  the Company has been focused on its Re*Imagined program: Third-party reviews by renowned firms helping the Company to identify areas for improvements from a financial  reporting and operational perspective;Continued improvement of real-time project tracking with action-orientated processes to resolve current delivery issues  to run initiatives to develop efficient best practices across our client facing delivery brands and to capitalize on our unique global unified platform;Deep-dive assessment of top management completed  and recruitment of critical hires is progressing well;New retention program for key talents launched  along with plan to attract the right new talents;Improve functional performance and overall cash management.In the period preceding today’s announcement  as part of the process  the Company shared forward looking assumptions with some of its shareholders and lenders who will participate in and/or support the transactions. The figures given for 2023 to 2025 were established in the context of the discussions on the refinancing  in no case they should constitute a guidance  nor forecasts of any kind.As a consequence of the above  the Company is publishing the following forward-looking assumptions: Overall demand is expected to continue to grow throughout the period.Despite benefits from Re*Imagined actions implemented starting in Q4 2022 are expected to materialize progressively over the year  for 2023: adjusted EBITDA after lease is to remain slightly positive but below 2022 levels  with results continuing to be impacted by additional costs to deliver major client projects coming from our last year operational issues.For 2024: sharp rebound in revenues and adjusted EBITDA after lease not to exceed €110 million mostly driven by benefits from actions to improve operations at MPC and the Mill. Mikros Animation to continue to be awarded with multiple new projects and Technicolor Games to continue to gain market shares.The Company is to continue to grow and expects a return to a normalized profitability in 2025. As mentioned in the press release published on March 8  2023  the completion of the refinancing of the Company would enable Technicolor Creative Studios to address its liquidity needs from Q2 2023 and allows operating cash flow to be focused on operational needs. In addition  notably as a consequence of the implementation of its Re*Imagined transformation program along with the Company’s footprint optimization  whose expected effects are included in the above forward-looking assumptions  the Company expects restructuring cost to amount to approximately €40 million in 2023  and to be reduced to approximately €15 million per year for 2024 and 2025. To finance its future growth and the Re*Imagined plan  the Company expects a level of capex (mainly IT) and capital leases to remain broadly stable in 2023 compared to 2022 and to progressively decrease to c. €50 million in 2025. Technicolor Creative Studios results are sensitive to external macro-economic assumptions  including the valuation of its main currencies - notably the US dollar  the Canadian dollar  and the British pound – which have evolved favorably since the beginning of 2022. These forward looking assumptions assume a EUR/USD exchange rate of 1.15  EUR/CAD of 1.52  EUR/GBP of 0.89 for 2023 and 2024. 2022 AND EARLY 2023 MAJOR CREATIVE SUCCESSES MPC: In 2022 and early 2023  20+ theatrical projects and 45+ streaming / episodic projects were in production at MPC.

This improvement resulted from a sustained demand and was achieved despite a significant shortage of experienced talents which caused delays on both ongoing projects and the start of new ones and highlighted the need for improved project management and monitoring to deliver on time. In addition to this lack of adequate resources  operations were negatively impacted by internal reorganisations at MPC and The Mill post-Covid. Those headwinds impacted fourth quarter revenue which decreased by 9% to €160 million versus Q4 2021. At MPC  FY 2022 revenue amounted to €375 million  up 55%. Full year significant revenue growth was driven by the continued ramp-up in production of major theatrical projects  as well as increasing contributions from all the major streaming platforms  while 2021 revenue was still affected by the Covid impacts. Post-Covid demand has been strong and MPC delivered 65+ major films with heavy visual effects content in 2022. However  fourth quarter revenue was down 30% to €58 million  due to the shortage of experienced talents creating more delays and inefficiencies in delivering some major projects. At Mikros Animation  FY 2022 revenue amounted to €147 million and were up 79%  and Q4 2022 revenue was up 105% year-on-year to €49 million. This improvement  in line with expectations  was mainly a result of higher volumes in feature animation projects. At The Mill  FY 2022 advertising revenue amounted to €248 million  representing a 6% decrease compared to 2021. Activity was restrained by decelerating advertising spending growth compared with a high comparative base in 2021  along with the impact from passing on certain projects in Q3 and Q4 because of the lack of specific types of experienced talent. Q4 revenue declined by 24% year-on-year to €51 million. At Technicolor Games  FY 2022 revenue amounted to €13 million  compared to €10 million in FY 2021 thanks to greater production capacity. Adjusted EBITDA after lease Q4 2022 Q4 2021 Var In € millions FY 2022 FY 2021 Var 160 177 -17 Revenue 784 601 183 -32 23 -55 Adjusted EBITDA after lease 20 75 -55 -20% 13% n.a. In % of revenue 3% 13% n.a. In FY 2022  adjusted EBITDA after lease amounted to €20 million compared to €75 million in FY 2021  with margin down from 13% to 3%. The €55 million decrease year-on-year  mainly in the fourth quarter 2022 (-€55 million compared to Q4 2021)  was primarily explained by unprecedented post-Covid recovery challenges and corresponding operational issues leading to higher costs. Despite an increased margin at Mikros Animation driven by higher sales  the margin at MPC was impacted by the shortage of experienced talent and a high-level departure of key talents  which drove production inefficiencies notably over the second half of the year. This resulted in higher costs and production delays. In addition  margin at The Mill decreased due to lower sales combined with the shortage of experienced talents resulting in fewer higher margin projects. For FY 20223  adjusted EBITDA after lease amounted to €32 million (6% margin) at MPC & Mikros Animation  €7 million (3% margin) at The Mill & Technicolor Games  and -€18 million for corporate & other. At December 31  2022  the Company employed approximately 11 800 people. Analysis of F ull Y ear net result in € million 2022 2021 Revenue 784 601 Cost of sales (716) (495) Gross margin 68 106 Selling and administrative expenses (93) (78) Restructuring costs (24) (5) Net impairment losses on non-current operating assets (1) (4) Other income (expense) (1) 0 Earnings before Interest & Tax (EBIT) from continuing operations (51) 20 Net financial expense (39) (21) Income tax expense (9) (18) Loss from continuing operations (99) (19) Net gain (loss) from discontinued operations 0 5 Net loss for the year (99) (14) Cost of sales amounted to €716 million in 2022 or 91.3% of revenue  compared to €495 million in 2021  or 82.4% of revenue. This €221 million increase mainly reflected higher revenue and higher costs linked to operational inefficiencies. Cost of sales in percentage of revenue has increased due to a lower absorption of costs linked to operational inefficiencies. The principal components of the Company’s cost of sales were labor costs  as well as costs related to real estate and fixed asset depreciation. As a result  gross margin amounted to €68 million in 2022  or 8.7% of revenue  compared to €106 million in 2021  or 17.6% of revenue. Selling and administrative expenses amounted to €93 million in 2022  or 11.9% of revenue  compared to €78 million in 2021  or 13.0% of revenue. General and administrative expenses amounted to €72 million (9.2% of revenue) compared to €63 million in 2021  or 10.5% of revenue. This percentage decrease reflects the cost structure optimization done throughout the Group. Selling and marketing expenses amounted to €21 million in 2022 compared to €15 million in 2021. Restructuring costs: in 2022  restructuring costs amounted to €24 million  compared to €5 million in 2021. This increase mainly resulted from footprint reorganization and the implementation of the Re*Imagined transformation plan. In 2022  the Company recorded net impairment losses of €1 million compared to €4 million in 2021 which mostly related to the impairment of Mr. X following integration of all VFX brands under MPC. As a result of the above  earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) from continuing operations was a loss of €51 million in 2022 compared to a profit of €20 million in 2021. The Company’s net financial expense amounted to €39 million in 2022 compared to €21 million in 2021: Net interest expense amounted to €43 million in 2022 compared to €21 million in 2021. FY 2021 and the first nine month of 2022 were mainly impacted by the financial interest on current accounts with the former parent company prior to the spin-off (Vantiva) while fourth quarter 2022 mainly corresponds to interest on the new Technicolor Creative Studios debt signed on September 15  2022.Other financial income was €4 million in 2022 (mainly due to foreign exchange gains) compared to nil in 2021. The Company’s total income tax expense  including both current and deferred taxes  amounted to an expense of €9 million in 2022 compared to an expense of €18 million in 2021. This decline mainly results from lower profit before tax. As a result of the above  loss from continuing operations amounted to €99 million in 2022 compared to a loss of €19 million in 2021. Net gain (loss) from discontinuing operations was nil in 2022 compared to a gain of €5 million in 2021 consisting of discontinued activities related to post-production activities sold to Streamland Media in April 2021. Net loss totaled €99 million in 2022 compared to a net loss €14 million in 2021. There was no net income attributable to non-controlling interests in 2022 nor in 2021. Adjusted Operating Free Cash Flow after lease Over FY 2022  adjusted Operating Free Cash Flow after lease4 amounted to €(76) million  compared to €74 million for 2021. This €150 million deterioration is explained by: € (55) million adjusted EBITDA after lease deterioration as a result of unprecedented post-Covid recovery challenges and corresponding operational issues leading to higher costs;€ (50) million working capital deterioration  primarily due to lower advanced payments as the order book is lower compared with the order book at the end of 2021  and in parallel cash received from 2021 advanced payments was consumed over the period in line with the advancement of the related projects;€ (38) million capex and capital lease cash out increase to €64 million  as a result of increased level of activity over the period;€ (5) million higher restructuring cash out  mainly due to the implementation of the Re*Imagined transformation plan.€ (2) million of higher other non-current cash out.Standalone cash and debt Cash and cash equivalents at the end of December 31  2022 amounted to €38 million and nominal gross debt to €828 million (€776 million IFRS debt  including €140 million of operating lease liabilities5). Liquidity as of December 31  2022 amounted to €38 million  consisting of the above €38 million of cash and cash equivalents  while the €40 million RCF was fully drawn.

Over the past quarters  the Company has been facing operational issues as well as market headwinds. To better seize market opportunities and strengthen Technicolor Creative Studios’ leading positions  the Company took a series of concrete measures through the Re*Imagined program. I am convinced that our strong position in this industry  a new reinforced leadership structure  together with ambitious operational initiatives  and now a reinforced capital structure will set Technicolor Creative Studios back on its journey towards sustainable and profitable growth. In addition  the Company will leverage its unique technological expertise  deep and long-standing customer relationships  and the world’s best talents. I would like to express my utmost gratitude to all Technicolor Creative Studios teams  who have demonstrated relentless commitment towards delivering extraordinary work to our clients. The whole industry continues to rely on our award-winning creativity and expertise to deliver our clients’ visions and additional projects. I would also like to thank our key creditors and shareholders for their renewed confidence with the recent signing of an agreement in principle on the refinancing of the Company. In conjunction with the improvement actions initiated through the Re*imagined program  this will improve the Company’s balance sheet and profitability  re-establishing its market leading position. “ TECHNICOLOR CREATIVE STUDIOS RECENT KEY EVOLUTIONS As announced on March 8  2023  Technicolor Creative Studios has reached an agreement in principle with a large majority of shareholders and lenders on a new financing structure which includes a c.€170 million new money injection. The refinancing would also reduce the financial liabilities of the business by reducing cash interest across all instruments as well as by subordinating €170 million and converting €30 million of existing debt into equity. A part of this new money financing would be made by end of March / beginning of April 2023  subject to finalization of the relevant documentation and satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set out therein. The remaining part of the c.€170 million new money financing is expected to be made available by the end of Q2 2023. The Agreement in Principle would therefore enable Technicolor Creative Studios to address its liquidity needs from Q2 2023 and allows operating cash flow to be focused on operational needs and would be combined with an evolution of the Company’s governance to be further detailed upon finalization of the conciliation protocol. Technicolor Creative Studios and its shareholders and lenders will pursue the implementation of the Agreement in Principle  which will be submitted for approval to the Commercial Court of Paris by the end of March.For further information on the Agreement in Principle  please refer to the press release dated March 8  2023 available at the following address: https://www.technicolorcreative.com/investor-center/. RESUMPTION OF TRADING ON MARCH 10  2023 UPON MARKET OPENING Following the suspension on March 8  2023  the trading of the shares issued by Technicolor Creative Studios will resume on this Friday 10 March 2023  at the market opening. FORWARD LOOKING ASSUMPTIONS Demand for VFX and original content remains strong  and the industry is recognizing Technicolor Creative Studios for the high quality work its studios are delivering. However  this demand for original content is facing a VFX production capacity still impacted by unprecedented post-Covid recovery challenges and corresponding operational issues. As a consequence  the Company has been focused on its Re*Imagined program: Third-party reviews by renowned firms helping the Company to identify areas for improvements from a financial  reporting and operational perspective;Continued improvement of real-time project tracking with action-orientated processes to resolve current delivery issues  to run initiatives to develop efficient best practices across our client facing delivery brands and to capitalize on our unique global unified platform;Deep-dive assessment of top management completed  and recruitment of critical hires is progressing well;New retention program for key talents launched  along with plan to attract the right new talents;Improve functional performance and overall cash management.In the period preceding today’s announcement  as part of the process  the Company shared forward looking assumptions with some of its shareholders and lenders who will participate in and/or support the transactions. The figures given for 2023 to 2025 were established in the context of the discussions on the refinancing  in no case they should constitute a guidance  nor forecasts of any kind.As a consequence of the above  the Company is publishing the following forward-looking assumptions: Overall demand is expected to continue to grow throughout the period.Despite benefits from Re*Imagined actions implemented starting in Q4 2022 are expected to materialize progressively over the year  for 2023: adjusted EBITDA after lease is to remain slightly positive but below 2022 levels  with results continuing to be impacted by additional costs to deliver major client projects coming from our last year operational issues.For 2024: sharp rebound in revenues and adjusted EBITDA after lease not to exceed €110 million mostly driven by benefits from actions to improve operations at MPC and the Mill. Mikros Animation to continue to be awarded with multiple new projects and Technicolor Games to continue to gain market shares.The Company is to continue to grow and expects a return to a normalized profitability in 2025. As mentioned in the press release published on March 8  2023  the completion of the refinancing of the Company would enable Technicolor Creative Studios to address its liquidity needs from Q2 2023 and allows operating cash flow to be focused on operational needs. In addition  notably as a consequence of the implementation of its Re*Imagined transformation program along with the Company’s footprint optimization  whose expected effects are included in the above forward-looking assumptions  the Company expects restructuring cost to amount to approximately €40 million in 2023  and to be reduced to approximately €15 million per year for 2024 and 2025. To finance its future growth and the Re*Imagined plan  the Company expects a level of capex (mainly IT) and capital leases to remain broadly stable in 2023 compared to 2022 and to progressively decrease to c. €50 million in 2025. Technicolor Creative Studios results are sensitive to external macro-economic assumptions  including the valuation of its main currencies - notably the US dollar  the Canadian dollar  and the British pound – which have evolved favorably since the beginning of 2022. These forward looking assumptions assume a EUR/USD exchange rate of 1.15  EUR/CAD of 1.52  EUR/GBP of 0.89 for 2023 and 2024. 2022 AND EARLY 2023 MAJOR CREATIVE SUCCESSES MPC: In 2022 and early 2023  20+ theatrical projects and 45+ streaming / episodic projects were in production at MPC.

Mikros Animation: During 2022  6 features and 15+ episodic series were in production at Mikros Animation. The Mill: During 2022  The Mill contributed to approximately 3 400 projects  including 34 Super Bowl LVI projects - 29 of which were TV spots that aired during the game  and were nominated for and won several prestigious industry awards.

Corporate & Other 1 1 n.a. n.a. 160 177 -9% -12% Total 784 601 30% 23% Technicolor Creative Studios FY 2022 revenue amounted to €784 million  up 30% (up 23% at constant rate) compared to 2021. This improvement resulted from a sustained demand and was achieved despite a significant shortage of experienced talents which caused delays on both ongoing projects and the start of new ones and highlighted the need for improved project management and monitoring to deliver on time. In addition to this lack of adequate resources  operations were negatively impacted by internal reorganisations at MPC and The Mill post-Covid. Those headwinds impacted fourth quarter revenue which decreased by 9% to €160 million versus Q4 2021. At MPC  FY 2022 revenue amounted to €375 million  up 55%. Full year significant revenue growth was driven by the continued ramp-up in production of major theatrical projects  as well as increasing contributions from all the major streaming platforms  while 2021 revenue was still affected by the Covid impacts. Post-Covid demand has been strong and MPC delivered 65+ major films with heavy visual effects content in 2022. However  fourth quarter revenue was down 30% to €58 million  due to the shortage of experienced talents creating more delays and inefficiencies in delivering some major projects. At Mikros Animation  FY 2022 revenue amounted to €147 million and were up 79%  and Q4 2022 revenue was up 105% year-on-year to €49 million. This improvement  in line with expectations  was mainly a result of higher volumes in feature animation projects. At The Mill  FY 2022 advertising revenue amounted to €248 million  representing a 6% decrease compared to 2021. Activity was restrained by decelerating advertising spending growth compared with a high comparative base in 2021  along with the impact from passing on certain projects in Q3 and Q4 because of the lack of specific types of experienced talent. Q4 revenue declined by 24% year-on-year to €51 million. At Technicolor Games  FY 2022 revenue amounted to €13 million  compared to €10 million in FY 2021 thanks to greater production capacity. Adjusted EBITDA after lease Q4 2022 Q4 2021 Var In € millions FY 2022 FY 2021 Var 160 177 -17 Revenue 784 601 183 -32 23 -55 Adjusted EBITDA after lease 20 75 -55 -20% 13% n.a. In % of revenue 3% 13% n.a. In FY 2022  adjusted EBITDA after lease amounted to €20 million compared to €75 million in FY 2021  with margin down from 13% to 3%. The €55 million decrease year-on-year  mainly in the fourth quarter 2022 (-€55 million compared to Q4 2021)  was primarily explained by unprecedented post-Covid recovery challenges and corresponding operational issues leading to higher costs. Despite an increased margin at Mikros Animation driven by higher sales  the margin at MPC was impacted by the shortage of experienced talent and a high-level departure of key talents  which drove production inefficiencies notably over the second half of the year. This resulted in higher costs and production delays. In addition  margin at The Mill decreased due to lower sales combined with the shortage of experienced talents resulting in fewer higher margin projects. For FY 20223  adjusted EBITDA after lease amounted to €32 million (6% margin) at MPC & Mikros Animation  €7 million (3% margin) at The Mill & Technicolor Games  and -€18 million for corporate & other. At December 31  2022  the Company employed approximately 11 800 people. Analysis of F ull Y ear net result in € million 2022 2021 Revenue 784 601 Cost of sales (716) (495) Gross margin 68 106 Selling and administrative expenses (93) (78) Restructuring costs (24) (5) Net impairment losses on non-current operating assets (1) (4) Other income (expense) (1) 0 Earnings before Interest & Tax (EBIT) from continuing operations (51) 20 Net financial expense (39) (21) Income tax expense (9) (18) Loss from continuing operations (99) (19) Net gain (loss) from discontinued operations 0 5 Net loss for the year (99) (14) Cost of sales amounted to €716 million in 2022 or 91.3% of revenue  compared to €495 million in 2021  or 82.4% of revenue. This €221 million increase mainly reflected higher revenue and higher costs linked to operational inefficiencies. Cost of sales in percentage of revenue has increased due to a lower absorption of costs linked to operational inefficiencies. The principal components of the Company’s cost of sales were labor costs  as well as costs related to real estate and fixed asset depreciation. As a result  gross margin amounted to €68 million in 2022  or 8.7% of revenue  compared to €106 million in 2021  or 17.6% of revenue. Selling and administrative expenses amounted to €93 million in 2022  or 11.9% of revenue  compared to €78 million in 2021  or 13.0% of revenue. General and administrative expenses amounted to €72 million (9.2% of revenue) compared to €63 million in 2021  or 10.5% of revenue. This percentage decrease reflects the cost structure optimization done throughout the Group. Selling and marketing expenses amounted to €21 million in 2022 compared to €15 million in 2021. Restructuring costs: in 2022  restructuring costs amounted to €24 million  compared to €5 million in 2021. This increase mainly resulted from footprint reorganization and the implementation of the Re*Imagined transformation plan. In 2022  the Company recorded net impairment losses of €1 million compared to €4 million in 2021 which mostly related to the impairment of Mr. X following integration of all VFX brands under MPC. As a result of the above  earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) from continuing operations was a loss of €51 million in 2022 compared to a profit of €20 million in 2021. The Company’s net financial expense amounted to €39 million in 2022 compared to €21 million in 2021: Net interest expense amounted to €43 million in 2022 compared to €21 million in 2021. FY 2021 and the first nine month of 2022 were mainly impacted by the financial interest on current accounts with the former parent company prior to the spin-off (Vantiva) while fourth quarter 2022 mainly corresponds to interest on the new Technicolor Creative Studios debt signed on September 15  2022.Other financial income was €4 million in 2022 (mainly due to foreign exchange gains) compared to nil in 2021. The Company’s total income tax expense  including both current and deferred taxes  amounted to an expense of €9 million in 2022 compared to an expense of €18 million in 2021. This decline mainly results from lower profit before tax. As a result of the above  loss from continuing operations amounted to €99 million in 2022 compared to a loss of €19 million in 2021. Net gain (loss) from discontinuing operations was nil in 2022 compared to a gain of €5 million in 2021 consisting of discontinued activities related to post-production activities sold to Streamland Media in April 2021. Net loss totaled €99 million in 2022 compared to a net loss €14 million in 2021. There was no net income attributable to non-controlling interests in 2022 nor in 2021. Adjusted Operating Free Cash Flow after lease Over FY 2022  adjusted Operating Free Cash Flow after lease4 amounted to €(76) million  compared to €74 million for 2021. This €150 million deterioration is explained by: € (55) million adjusted EBITDA after lease deterioration as a result of unprecedented post-Covid recovery challenges and corresponding operational issues leading to higher costs;€ (50) million working capital deterioration  primarily due to lower advanced payments as the order book is lower compared with the order book at the end of 2021  and in parallel cash received from 2021 advanced payments was consumed over the period in line with the advancement of the related projects;€ (38) million capex and capital lease cash out increase to €64 million  as a result of increased level of activity over the period;€ (5) million higher restructuring cash out  mainly due to the implementation of the Re*Imagined transformation plan.€ (2) million of higher other non-current cash out.Standalone cash and debt Cash and cash equivalents at the end of December 31  2022 amounted to €38 million and nominal gross debt to €828 million (€776 million IFRS debt  including €140 million of operating lease liabilities5). Liquidity as of December 31  2022 amounted to €38 million  consisting of the above €38 million of cash and cash equivalents  while the €40 million RCF was fully drawn.

Adjusted EBITA (Earnings before Interest  tax  depreciation and amortization) after lease corresponds to EBIT (Earnings before interest and taxes) adjusted positively by the amortization of intangibles that arose from acquisitions or disposals (PPA amortization)  restructuring costs  other non-current items  comprising Other (expenses) income  Impairment (losses) gain and Capital gains/losses  and negatively by the difference between operating lease payments and operating leases assets depreciation.Adjusted Operating Free Cash Flow after lease is defined as Adjusted EBITDA after lease minus capital expenditures  excluding usage-based IT cost (without cloud rendering)  capital leases cash out  restructuring cash out  change in working capital (excluding cloud rendering cash out) and other non-current cash out.

To better seize market opportunities and strengthen Technicolor Creative Studios’ leading positions  the Company took a series of concrete measures through the Re*Imagined program. I am convinced that our strong position in this industry  a new reinforced leadership structure  together with ambitious operational initiatives  and now a reinforced capital structure will set Technicolor Creative Studios back on its journey towards sustainable and profitable growth. In addition  the Company will leverage its unique technological expertise  deep and long-standing customer relationships  and the world’s best talents.I would like to express my utmost gratitude to all Technicolor Creative Studios teams  who have demonstrated relentless commitment towards delivering extraordinary work to our clients. The whole industry continues to rely on our award-winning creativity and expertise to deliver our clients’ visions and additional projects.I would also like to thank our key creditors and shareholders for their renewed confidence with the recent signing of an agreement in principle on the refinancing of the Company. In conjunction with the improvement actions initiated through the Re*imagined program  this will improve the Company’s balance sheet and profitability  re-establishing its market leading position. “TECHNICOLOR CREATIVE STUDIOS RECENT KEY EVOLUTIONSAs announced on March 8  2023  Technicolor Creative Studios has reached an agreement in principle with a large majority of shareholders and lenders on a new financing structure which includes a c.€170 million new money injection. The refinancing would also reduce the financial liabilities of the business by reducing cash interest across all instruments as well as by subordinating €170 million and converting €30 million of existing debt into equity.A part of this new money financing would be made by end of March / beginning of April 2023  subject to finalization of the relevant documentation and satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set out therein. The remaining part of the c.€170 million new money financing is expected to be made available by the end of Q2 2023.The Agreement in Principle would therefore enable Technicolor Creative Studios to address its liquidity needs from Q2 2023 and allows operating cash flow to be focused on operational needs and would be combined with an evolution of the Company’s governance to be further detailed upon finalization of the conciliation protocol.Technicolor Creative Studios and its shareholders and lenders will pursue the implementation of the Agreement in Principle  which will be submitted for approval to the Commercial Court of Paris by the end of March.For further information on the Agreement in Principle  please refer to the press release dated March 8  2023 available at the following address: https://www.technicolorcreative.com/investor-center/.RESUMPTION OF TRADING ON MARCH 10  2023 UPON MARKET OPENINGFollowing the suspension on March 8  2023  the trading of the shares issued by Technicolor Creative Studios will resume on this Friday 10 March 2023  at the market opening.FORWARD LOOKING ASSUMPTIONSDemand for VFX and original content remains strong  and the industry is recognizing Technicolor Creative Studios for the high quality work its studios are delivering. However  this demand for original content is facing a VFX production capacity still impacted by unprecedented post-Covid recovery challenges and corresponding operational issues. As a consequence  the Company has been focused on its Re*Imagined program:Third-party reviews by renowned firms helping the Company to identify areas for improvements from a financial  reporting and operational perspective;Continued improvement of real-time project tracking with action-orientated processes to resolve current delivery issues  to run initiatives to develop efficient best practices across our client facing delivery brands and to capitalize on our unique global unified platform;Deep-dive assessment of top management completed  and recruitment of critical hires is progressing well;New retention program for key talents launched  along with plan to attract the right new talents;Improve functional performance and overall cash management.In the period preceding today’s announcement  as part of the process  the Company shared forward looking assumptions with some of its shareholders and lenders who will participate in and/or support the transactions.The figures given for 2023 to 2025 were established in the context of the discussions on the refinancing  in no case they should constitute a guidance  nor forecasts of any kind.As a consequence of the above  the Company is publishing the following forward-looking assumptions:Overall demand is expected to continue to grow throughout the period.Despite benefits from Re*Imagined actions implemented starting in Q4 2022 are expected to materialize progressively over the year  for 2023: adjusted EBITDA after lease is to remain slightly positive but below 2022 levels  with results continuing to be impacted by additional costs to deliver major client projects coming from our last year operational issues.For 2024: sharp rebound in revenues and adjusted EBITDA after lease not to exceed €110 million mostly driven by benefits from actions to improve operations at MPC and the Mill. Mikros Animation to continue to be awarded with multiple new projects and Technicolor Games to continue to gain market shares.The Company is to continue to grow and expects a return to a normalized profitability in 2025.As mentioned in the press release published on March 8  2023  the completion of the refinancing of the Company would enable Technicolor Creative Studios to address its liquidity needs from Q2 2023 and allows operating cash flow to be focused on operational needs.In addition  notably as a consequence of the implementation of its Re*Imagined transformation program along with the Company’s footprint optimization  whose expected effects are included in the above forward-looking assumptions  the Company expects restructuring cost to amount to approximately €40 million in 2023  and to be reduced to approximately €15 million per year for 2024 and 2025.To finance its future growth and the Re*Imagined plan  the Company expects a level of capex (mainly IT) and capital leases to remain broadly stable in 2023 compared to 2022 and to progressively decrease to c. €50 million in 2025.Technicolor Creative Studios results are sensitive to external macro-economic assumptions  including the valuation of its main currencies - notably the US dollar  the Canadian dollar  and the British pound – which have evolved favorably since the beginning of 2022. These forward looking assumptions assume a EUR/USD exchange rate of 1.15  EUR/CAD of 1.52  EUR/GBP of 0.89 for 2023 and 2024.2022 AND EARLY 2023 MAJOR CREATIVE SUCCESSESMPC: In 2022 and early 2023  20+ theatrical projects and 45+ streaming / episodic projects were in production at MPC. The Studio in 2022 won a Visual Effects Society (“VES”) award for Outstanding Animated Character in a Photoreal Feature for its work on Apple TV+’s Finch and a César Award for Best Visual Effects for Annette. 11 films selected for the 2022 Cannes Film Festival featured the work of MPC  including the Dardenne brothers’ Tori and Lokita (Prix Spécial); the world premiere of Baz Luhrmann’s Elvis; and screening of Top Gun: Maverick starring Tom Cruise.

In February 2023  MPC won three VES Awards for its work on Thirteen Lives (Outstanding Supporting Visual Effects in a Photoreal Feature) and Guillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio (Outstanding Visual Effects in an Animated Feature and Outstanding Created Environment in an Animated Feature).Mikros Animation: During 2022  6 features and 15+ episodic series were in production at Mikros Animation.The Mill: During 2022  The Mill contributed to approximately 3 400 projects  including 34 Super Bowl LVI projects - 29 of which were TV spots that aired during the game  and were nominated for and won several prestigious industry awards. Notable projects during the year include Burberry’s ‘Open Spaces’  Samsung’s ‘The Spider and the Window’  Samsung’s ‘Playtime Is Over’  Pepsi’s Super Bowl halftime trailer ‘The Call’  Mastercard’s ‘What’s Priceless to You?’ and the title sequence for Netflix’s Cabinet of Curiosities.

This improvement resulted from a sustained demand and was achieved despite a significant shortage of experienced talents which caused delays on both ongoing projects and the start of new ones and highlighted the need for improved project management and monitoring to deliver on time. In addition to this lack of adequate resources  operations were negatively impacted by internal reorganisations at MPC and The Mill post-Covid. Those headwinds impacted fourth quarter revenue which decreased by 9% to €160 million versus Q4 2021.At MPC  FY 2022 revenue amounted to €375 million  up 55%. Full year significant revenue growth was driven by the continued ramp-up in production of major theatrical projects  as well as increasing contributions from all the major streaming platforms  while 2021 revenue was still affected by the Covid impacts. Post-Covid demand has been strong and MPC delivered 65+ major films with heavy visual effects content in 2022.However  fourth quarter revenue was down 30% to €58 million  due to the shortage of experienced talents creating more delays and inefficiencies in delivering some major projects.At Mikros Animation  FY 2022 revenue amounted to €147 million and were up 79%  and Q4 2022 revenue was up 105% year-on-year to €49 million. This improvement  in line with expectations  was mainly a result of higher volumes in feature animation projects.At The Mill  FY 2022 advertising revenue amounted to €248 million  representing a 6% decrease compared to 2021. Activity was restrained by decelerating advertising spending growth compared with a high comparative base in 2021  along with the impact from passing on certain projects in Q3 and Q4 because of the lack of specific types of experienced talent. Q4 revenue declined by 24% year-on-year to €51 million.At Technicolor Games  FY 2022 revenue amounted to €13 million  compared to €10 million in FY 2021 thanks to greater production capacity.Adjusted EBITDA after leaseQ4 2022 Q4 2021 Var In € millions FY 2022 FY 2021 Var 160 177 -17 Revenue 784 601 183 -32 23 -55 Adjusted EBITDA after lease 20 75 -55 -20% 13% n.a. In % of revenue 3% 13% n.a.In FY 2022  adjusted EBITDA after lease amounted to €20 million compared to €75 million in FY 2021  with margin down from 13% to 3%.The €55 million decrease year-on-year  mainly in the fourth quarter 2022 (-€55 million compared to Q4 2021)  was primarily explained by unprecedented post-Covid recovery challenges and corresponding operational issues leading to higher costs. Despite an increased margin at Mikros Animation driven by higher sales  the margin at MPC was impacted by the shortage of experienced talent and a high-level departure of key talents  which drove production inefficiencies notably over the second half of the year. This resulted in higher costs and production delays. In addition  margin at The Mill decreased due to lower sales combined with the shortage of experienced talents resulting in fewer higher margin projects.For FY 20223  adjusted EBITDA after lease amounted to €32 million (6% margin) at MPC & Mikros Animation  €7 million (3% margin) at The Mill & Technicolor Games  and -€18 million for corporate & other.At December 31  2022  the Company employed approximately 11 800 people.Analysis of F ull Y ear net resultin € million 2022 2021 Revenue 784 601 Cost of sales (716) (495) Gross margin 68 106 Selling and administrative expenses (93) (78) Restructuring costs (24) (5) Net impairment losses on non-current operating assets (1) (4) Other income (expense) (1) 0 Earnings before Interest & Tax (EBIT) from continuing operations (51) 20 Net financial expense (39) (21) Income tax expense (9) (18) Loss from continuing operations (99) (19) Net gain (loss) from discontinued operations 0 5 Net loss for the year (99) (14)Cost of sales amounted to €716 million in 2022 or 91.3% of revenue  compared to €495 million in 2021  or 82.4% of revenue. This €221 million increase mainly reflected higher revenue and higher costs linked to operational inefficiencies. Cost of sales in percentage of revenue has increased due to a lower absorption of costs linked to operational inefficiencies. The principal components of the Company’s cost of sales were labor costs  as well as costs related to real estate and fixed asset depreciation. As a result  gross margin amounted to €68 million in 2022  or 8.7% of revenue  compared to €106 million in 2021  or 17.6% of revenue.Selling and administrative expenses amounted to €93 million in 2022  or 11.9% of revenue  compared to €78 million in 2021  or 13.0% of revenue. General and administrative expenses amounted to €72 million (9.2% of revenue) compared to €63 million in 2021  or 10.5% of revenue. This percentage decrease reflects the cost structure optimization done throughout the Group. Selling and marketing expenses amounted to €21 million in 2022 compared to €15 million in 2021.Restructuring costs: in 2022  restructuring costs amounted to €24 million  compared to €5 million in 2021. This increase mainly resulted from footprint reorganization and the implementation of the Re*Imagined transformation plan.In 2022  the Company recorded net impairment losses of €1 million compared to €4 million in 2021 which mostly related to the impairment of Mr. X following integration of all VFX brands under MPC.As a result of the above  earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) from continuing operations was a loss of €51 million in 2022 compared to a profit of €20 million in 2021.The Company’s net financial expense amounted to €39 million in 2022 compared to €21 million in 2021:Net interest expense amounted to €43 million in 2022 compared to €21 million in 2021. FY 2021 and the first nine month of 2022 were mainly impacted by the financial interest on current accounts with the former parent company prior to the spin-off (Vantiva) while fourth quarter 2022 mainly corresponds to interest on the new Technicolor Creative Studios debt signed on September 15  2022.Other financial income was €4 million in 2022 (mainly due to foreign exchange gains) compared to nil in 2021.The Company’s total income tax expense  including both current and deferred taxes  amounted to an expense of €9 million in 2022 compared to an expense of €18 million in 2021. This decline mainly results from lower profit before tax.As a result of the above  loss from continuing operations amounted to €99 million in 2022 compared to a loss of €19 million in 2021.Net gain (loss) from discontinuing operations was nil in 2022 compared to a gain of €5 million in 2021 consisting of discontinued activities related to post-production activities sold to Streamland Media in April 2021.Net loss totaled €99 million in 2022 compared to a net loss €14 million in 2021. There was no net income attributable to non-controlling interests in 2022 nor in 2021.Adjusted Operating Free Cash Flow after leaseOver FY 2022  adjusted Operating Free Cash Flow after lease4 amounted to €(76) million  compared to €74 million for 2021.This €150 million deterioration is explained by:€ (55) million adjusted EBITDA after lease deterioration as a result of unprecedented post-Covid recovery challenges and corresponding operational issues leading to higher costs;€ (50) million working capital deterioration  primarily due to lower advanced payments as the order book is lower compared with the order book at the end of 2021  and in parallel cash received from 2021 advanced payments was consumed over the period in line with the advancement of the related projects;€ (38) million capex and capital lease cash out increase to €64 million  as a result of increased level of activity over the period;€ (5) million higher restructuring cash out  mainly due to the implementation of the Re*Imagined transformation plan.€ (2) million of higher other non-current cash out.Standalone cash and debtCash and cash equivalents at the end of December 31  2022 amounted to €38 million and nominal gross debt to €828 million (€776 million IFRS debt  including €140 million of operating lease liabilities5).Liquidity as of December 31  2022 amounted to €38 million  consisting of the above €38 million of cash and cash equivalents  while the €40 million RCF was fully drawn.Status of audit work: The audit work is in progress.***WARNING / FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTSThis press release contains certain statements that constitute ""forward-looking statements""  including but not limited to statements that are predictions of or indicate future events  trends  plans or objectives  based on certain assumptions or which do not directly relate to historical or current facts.

20305,EuroNext,Bing API,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4586629-care-property-invest-stubbornly-holding-not-a-good-idea,Care Property Invest: Holding Onto A 7.5% Yield Isn’t A Good Idea (OTCMKTS:CRPIF),Care Property Invest recently completed a capital raise. This will be a tremendous help for the balance sheet but has a very negative impact on the AFFO per share. Read more here.,Goran13/iStock via Getty ImagesIntroductionCare Property Invest (OTCPK:CRPIF) is a Brussels-listed REIT focusing on healthcare and nursing home properties. The REIT aggressively expanded its asset base in the past few years but it looks like reality is catching up and a recent rights issue will severely dilute the results on a per-share basis. Despite this  the REIT plans to keep its dividend for this year unchanged which will result in a substantial increase of the payout ratio from roughly 80% to 98% which is pretty high considering the REIT still has to bear the brunt of the recent interest rate increases.Yahoo FinanceCare Property Invest has its primary listing on Euronext Brussels where it's trading with CPINV as ticker symbol. The average daily volume is approximately 80 000 shares per day and the current market cap is just over 500M EUR after taking the impact of the recent capital raise into account.The FY 2022 results look good - But that's just an optical illusionI will be pretty brief about the company's financial results in 2022 as those are no longer very relevant given the recent completion of a capital increase which increases the share count and dilutes the EPRA earnings per share. But in order to estimate the magnitude of the impact on the per-share performance it makes sense to have a quick look at the reported results.Care Property Invest reported a total net rental income of just over 54M EUR  an increase of about 25% compared to the previous year thanks to an expanded asset base as Care's business model was mainly based on growth through acquisitions and organic development. The total property result (comparable to the NOI) was 54.3M EUR which is a good result.Care Property Investor RelationsThe net income of Care Property Invest was 88.7M EUR  mainly thanks to a 38.6M EUR increase in the value of financial assets and a 19M EUR increase in the value of the properties. The latter is a bit surprising given the contraction of rental yields on the market while the former is entirely related to the value increase of the interest rate hedges. Nice to see pop up in the results  but not very relevant as this is just a temporary effect.So just like North American REITs we should ignore the reported net income and look at the EPRA earnings (which is pretty similar to the FFO calculation in North America). We see the FFO was 30.8M EUR or 1.11 EUR per share while the AFFO was 34.3M EUR or 1.24 EUR per share. The AFFO is higher because there are no maintenance capital expenditures (Care Property's assets are leased on a triple net basis) and approximately 3.5M EUR in lease incentives are added back to the equation there.Care Property Investor RelationsThe REIT is paying a distribution of 1 EUR per share which is very well covered based on these results. The dividend tax is 15% for this type of REIT: While Belgium has a standard 30% dividend tax  healthcare and nursing home REITs enjoy a reduced rate of 15% if they qualify - which Care Property Invest does. The current yield of 7.7% looks pretty appealing.Care Property's 2023 result will be much lower and there's more pain aheadWhile the 2022 results were excellent and you'd think Care Property Invest is a buy  let's not forget there is quite a bit of pain ahead of us. Subsequent to the end of 2022  Care Property completed a capital raise  issuing 9.25 million new shares at 12.00 EUR per share in a rights issue for total gross proceeds of 110M EUR. That's good news and bad news. The good news is obviously that this raise is a tremendous help to the balance sheet as Care Property had to do something to get its LTV ratio below 50% again.Care Property Investor RelationsThe bad news is of course that the financial results now have to be distributed over more than 30% more shares and this will result in a tremendous dilution of the earnings per share. You can argue Care Property Invest will also save money due to lower interest expenses and while that is correct  that benefit won't be even close to mitigating the impact of the dilution.In fact  despite reducing the debt pile by in excess of 100M EUR  I expect Care Property to continue to see its interest expenses to increase in the next few years. For 2023  Care Property Invest estimates an AFFO of 1.03-1.05 EUR per share which is already a reduction from the 1.05-1.10 EUR it mentioned in the prospectus which was issued in January as part of the rights issue.But let's take a step back and have a look at the bigger picture.We know the NOI was 54.3M EUR and we know about 3.5M EUR in rent incentives will roll off later this year. So the underlying NOI would be around 58M EUR. We should be able to round this up to 60M EUR based on the H2 performance of Care Property Invest and if we apply an additional 5% rent hike for this year I think it is okay to assume a 63M EUR NOI for this year. So far  so good.One of the elements that caught the market by surprise was the increase of the average interest rate. Although Care Property Invest has hedged about 70% of its interest exposure  the average cost of debt increased to 2.14% as of the end of 2022. That includes the hedges as the market rates are about 4-4.5% now which means that as debt has to be refinanced  Care Property's average cost of debt will increase pretty fast.But let's focus on the current debt situation. Care Property Invest had 581M EUR of net debt as of the end of 2022. Let's assume this decreased to 475M EUR after the completion of the recent rights issue. If I would now apply an average cost of debt of 2.30% for this year (the 2.14% as of the end of 2022 will undoubtedly continue to increase so I think I'm still pretty generous here)  the total amount of interest expenses will increase to 11M EUR compared to 10M EUR in FY 2022. So despite the capital raise  Care Property will likely still face a higher interest bill.This also means the EPRA earnings will likely see an increase of 6-7M EUR based on the net rental income increase while also taking higher G&A expenses into account. But it will lose about 1M EUR on the interest side. So let's say the Adjusted EPRA earnings (comparable to the AFFO) will increase by 5M EUR to 39M EUR.There are now 37M EUR shares outstanding so this means the AFFO would come in at approximately 1.05 EUR per share. So far so good  and my numbers match up with the REIT's guidance.But 2023 is just a transition year and I'm using an average interest rate of just 2.3% while we know things will get much worse.So let's have a look at 2024 and beyond. Let's assume the NOI increases by 4% again to 65M EUR while the operating expenses don't increase further. But in 2024 an additional 30M EUR in debt has to be refinanced followed by 50M EUR in 2025 and 104M EUR in 2026.Care Property Investor RelationsLet's assume Care Property Invest can continue to increase its NOI at 3% per year until 2027. That would result in a NOI of 72M EUR by the end of 2027. That's 9M EUR higher than what we can reasonably expect in 2023 but G&A will undoubtedly increase as well  so let's take off 1M EUR of that NOI growth. That's 8M EUR in anticipated NOI growth between now and 2027.Meanwhile  between 2024 and 2027  the REIT has to refinance 275M EUR of debt. Debt that's costing on average 2.3% in my 2023 model  but will likely cost north of 4% further down the road. This means the total amount of interest expenses will increase by approximately 5M EUR per year. That's lower than the anticipated NOI increase  but that NOI increase is based on zero rent incentives  a 5% rent hike in 2023 followed by 3% per year over the next few years. As some of the nursing home operators are in tough shape (Orpea  for instance  is working through a restructuring plan) I doubt the REIT can get away without giving more rent incentives to make sure its tenants survive.The recent capital raise definitely helps the balance sheet safety. Even if you would apply a higher capitalization rate of 6.25% on the anticipated normalized NOI of 63M EUR the LTV ratio will remain below 50% after the recent 110M EUR raise.Investment thesisAnd that's the double-edged sword here. In a perfect world  Care Property Invest will get through a difficult year in 2023 and should be able to continue to cover its dividend on the condition of being able to continuously hike its NOI by 3% per year and not seeing its cost of debt exceed 4% (which may be a tough ask).Care Property Investor RelationsThe problem is of course that if this does not go perfectly according to plan  Care Property will no longer be able to afford its dividend. Let's say that by 2027 Care Property needs to give about 5M EUR per year in rental incentives. That would reduce the AFFO to just under 1 EUR per share which makes the current yield unsustainable. Care Property also offers a scrip dividend to its investors and while that will help to keep cash inside the REIT and keep the LTV ratio under control  it also means the AFFO will have to be divided over more shares. Assuming 30% of the dividend rights are converted into new shares  the share count will increase from 37M shares right now to almost 42M EUR assuming a scrip dividend priced at 12-12.5 EUR per share.This means the margin of safety is too thin for now. Speculative investors could consider picking up the stock here but the dividend can only be maintained if the conditions I mentioned above are met as there is very little wiggle room. I think this is a missed opportunity for Care Property Invest to have cut the dividend to 80 or 85 cents rather than the 1 EUR per share as that slightly lower dividend would be sustainable.If Care Property Invest would drop towards 10 EUR per share I would be interested in going long  while realizing a dividend cut further down the road is pretty likely. This makes Care Property a speculative buy right now  but not a reliable dividend stock to hold forever.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.
