Release time   ...https:/‚Ä¶,Polymetal International plc (POLY)Polymetal: Preliminary results for the year ended 31 December 202216-March-2023 / 10:00 MSKThe issuer is solely responsible for the content of this announcement.Release time IMMEDIATE LSE  MOEX  AIX: POLYADR: AUCOY Date 16 March 2023 Polymetal International plc Preliminary results for the year ended 31 December 2022 Polymetal International plc (‚ÄúPolymetal‚Äù or the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù) announces the Group's preliminary results for the year ended 31 December 2022. ‚ÄúIn 2022  the Company was subject to extraordinary and unprecedented external challenges. Despite these adverse circumstances  Polymetal managed to maintain operational stability and achieve excellent safety performance. Nonetheless  international sanctions against Russia have had a huge impact on domestic inflation  supply chains and sales channels. As a result  costs have risen and working capital requirements ballooned with cash flow plummeting. We start 2023 from a position of relative strength and expect the resumption of free cash flows and a reduction in net debt over the course of the coming year‚Äù  said Vitaly Nesis  Group CEO  commenting on the results. FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS In 2022  revenue decreased by 3%  totalling US$ 2 801 million (2021: US$ 2 890 million)  of which US$ 933 million (33%) was generated from operations in Kazakhstan and US$ 1 868 million (67%) from operations in the Russian Federation. Average realised gold price decreased by 2% while silver price decreased by 12%  both almost tracking market dynamics. Gold equivalent (GE) production was 1 712 Koz  a 2% increase year-on-year (y-o-y). Gold sales decreased by 1% y-o-y to 1 376 Koz  while silver sales increased by 6% to 18.5 Moz. Disruption in sales channels resulted in a huge gap between production and sales in Q2-Q3 2022  but was largely eliminated in Q4 2022. The remaining gap is expected to close during the course of 1H 2023.Group Total Cash Costs (TCC) [1] for 2022 were US$ 942/GE oz and within the Group‚Äôs guidance of US$ 900-1 000/GE oz  although representing an increase of 29% y-o-y  which was predominantly due to double-digit domestic inflation and the appreciation of Rouble/USD exchange rate. Escalation of logistical costs and sharp increases in the price of consumables caused by the imposition of sanctions (explosives  equipment spares  cyanide) also impacted the Group‚Äôs TCC.[1] All-in Sustaining Cash Costs (AISC) 1 amounted to US$ 1 344/GE oz  up 31% y-o-y  which was within the Group‚Äôs guidance of US$ 1 300-1 400/GE and also driven by the same factors as above.Adjusted EBITDA 1 was US$ 1 017 million  31% lower than in 2021  as costs rose and metals prices declined. US$ 478 million (47%) of Group EBITDA originated in Kazakhstan and US$ 539 million (53%) in the Russian Federation. The Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased by 15 percentage points to 36% (2021: 51%).Underlying net earnings [2] were US$ 440 million (2021: US$ 913 million). As a result of a lower Group EBITDA and non-cash impairment charges (a post-tax amount of US$ 653 million)  the Group recorded a net loss for the period of US$ 288 million in 2022  compared to profits of US$ 904 million in 2021.[2] Capital expenditure was US$ 794 million [3]   up 5% compared with US$ 759 million in 2021 and 2% above the guidance range of US$ 725-775 million  reflecting accelerated purchases and contractor advances for ongoing projects (most notably  Amursk POX-2)  combined with inflationary and logistical pressures on imported equipment  materials and services.[3] Net operating cash inflow was US$ 206 million (2021: US$ 1 195 million)  on the back of inventories build-up of US$ 473 million. This includes positive cash flow of US$ 337 million from operations in Kazakhstan and negative cash flow of US$ 131 million from operations in the Russian Federation. The Group reported negative free cash flow 1 of US$ 445 million in 2022 (2021: positive US$ 418 million).Net debt 1 increased to US$ 2 393 million during the period (31 December 2021: US$ 1 647 million)  representing 2.35x of the Adjusted EBITDA (2021: 1.13x). The increase in net debt was driven by the decline in profitability  the persistently high capital intensity of the business and a very significant expansion in working capital. DIVIDENDS The Board has carefully evaluated the liquidity and solvency of the business in light of multiple external uncertainties. Taking into account the Group‚Äôs leverage (2.35x Net debt/EBITDA  materially above the level of 1.5x target leverage ratio and the significant level of uncertainty regarding external factors  the Board has decided not to propose any dividend for 2022 in order to allow the Group to maintain strategic and operating flexibility in a highly volatile and uncertain external environment.

Lost time injury frequency rate (LTIFR) among the Company‚Äôs workforce for the full year decreased by 17% y-o-y to 0.10. Days lost due to work-related injuries (DIS) fell by 42% y-o-y to 877.The Company‚Äôs FY 2022 GE production amounted to 1 712 Koz  a y-o-y increase of 2% and in line with the original production guidance of 1.7 Moz. The first full year of operations at Nezhda and initial production at Kutyn (Albazino hub) compensated for declining grades at mature assets.Amursk POX-2 and other development projects progressed in line with schedules revised after the introduction of international sanctions against Russia in Q1 and Q2 2022. ENVIRONMENTAL  SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE (‚ÄúESG‚Äù) HIGHLIGHTS Varvara Mine in Kazakhstan was certified for full compliance under the International Cyanide Management Code by the International Cyanide Management Institute (ICMI).In 2022  Polymetal continued to receive external recognition of its ESG efforts with high ratings and scores by Sustainalytics  Vigeo Eiris and ISS ESG Corporate Rating.In January 2023  the Group published its second green loan allocation report under the corporate green financing framework  which confirmed spending of US$ 125 million loan given by Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale for environmentally friendly projects at the Company‚Äôs sites. Our total green and sustainability-linked loan portfolio is now US$ 592 million  amounting to 20% of the total outstanding debt of the Group.Greenhouse gas emissions intensity (scopes 1 and 2) was 15% lower in 2022 compared to 2019 (Scope 1 and 2)  attributed to increasing our renewable electricity consumption (30% of total)  as well as energy efficiency initiatives  such as improving heat utilization systems and the implementation of solar power generation.In 2022  the share of water reused and recycled amounted to 91% of the total water consumption at our sites (compared to 90% in 2021). In 2022  fresh water intensity for ore processing [9] decreased by 49% (as compared to the 2019 baseline)  to 138 m 3 /1000 t of ore processed.[9] We continue to promote equal-opportunity culture through training and communications  empowering more women to take leadership roles: in 2022  the share of female participants of our Talent Pool development program increased to 35% (compared to 30% in 2021). 2023 OUTLOOK The Group reiterates its current production guidance of 1.7 Moz of GE for FY 2023. Production will be weighted towards 2H 2023 due to traditional seasonality at several production sites.Polymetal expects its costs to be in the ranges of US$ 950-1 000/GE oz for TCC and US$ 1 300-1 400/GE oz for AISC [10] . A minor y-o-y increase is mostly due to expected domestic inflation and royalty increase in Kazakhstan.[10] Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of US$ 700-750 million. Major investment projects include Amursk POX-2  Albazino power line  Voro flotation (completion expected Q2)  Prognoz (completion expected Q4)  and Mayskoye backfill plant. PRESERVING SHAREHOLDER VALUE The Group continues to evaluate all available options to modify the Group‚Äôs asset-holding structure in order to maximise shareholder value.The Group‚Äôs preferred option is the potential re-domiciliation of the parent company  Polymetal International plc  into the Astana International Financial Centre (AIFC)  a financial hub in Astana  Kazakhstan  taking into account the Group‚Äôs significant operations and presence in the region  the AIFC legal system  tax regime and the ability to execute such a re-domiciliation.The key objective of any re-domiciliation will be to preserve shareholder value  restore our ability to pay dividends and increase the strategic flexibility to conduct our operations  as well enabling us to pursue different strategic developments for the Russian and Kazakhstan businesses.No decision has been made and there can therefore be no certainty that the Company will proceed with  or ultimately complete a re-domiciliation.The Company has attempted to secure the services of a depository interest provider in order to continue trading on the London Stock Exchange  should the re-domiciliation proceed. However  as at the date of this announcement  the Company has not yet been able to secure such services due to the depository interest providers approached by the Company being unable or unwilling to provide such arrangements  while Euroclear  as the CREST system operator  has not confirmed the availability of this kind of services for the AIFC jurisdiction. The Company is continuing its efforts to secure such services.The Company confirms that any actions will be compliant with all applicable international sanctions  counter-sanctions and regulatory requirements and the Company will continue to take into consideration the interests of its stakeholders prior to making a decision.Further announcements in relation to the Group‚Äôs efforts to restore shareholder value and modify the Group‚Äôs asset-holding structure will be made when appropriate.

The cycle of the Semiconductor Industry segment is expected to return to growth in the second half of the year.Aspocomp estimates that its net sales for 2023 will increase from 2022 and its operating result for 2023 will be at the same level as in 2022. In 2022  net sales amounted to EUR 39.1 million and the operating result to EUR 4.5 million.CEO‚ÄôS REVIEW‚Äú2022 was the best financial year in the history of Aspocomp in its current form. Full year net sales grew by 18 percent to EUR 39.1 million. However  in the last quarter of the year  net sales decreased by 6 percent compared to the previous year after a few individual customer orders were pushed back to the current fiscal year.The flattening of the demand for information and communication technology equipment  which was strongly accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic  is slowing down the cycle of the semiconductor industry. The temporary slowdown in the cycle is typical for the industry. Now it also involves an increase in inventory levels in different parts of the supply chain  mainly due to availability problems. The development of Aspocomp‚Äôs net sales in the last quarter reflected the decline in the semiconductor industry‚Äôs strong demand at the end of 2022. The industry‚Äôs long-term growth prospects are still strong. We expect inventory levels to normalize  investment to pick up and the cycle to turn upward again in the second half of 2023.Despite the slowdown of the cycle in the last quarter  Aspocomp‚Äôs Semiconductor Industry customer segment‚Äôs full-year net sales grew by 158 percent. As expected  the Automotive customer segment‚Äôs sales decreased in the last quarter compared to the corresponding period of the previous year  when customers increased their inventory levels. Aspocomp gained dozens of new customers during the year  especially in the Security  Defense and Aerospace customer segment. Order cycles are typically long in this segment  so we expect net sales growth to materialize with a delay.Our order book amounted to EUR 14.3 million. The order book decreased by EUR 2.2 million from the comparison period because the orders are scheduled for a shorter period than before due to the normalization of the production supplies market and the general improvement in availability.Aspocomp‚Äôs operating result for the entire fiscal year 2022 was excellent  amounting to EUR 4.5 million. The operating result was 11.5 percent of net sales  while the fourth-quarter operating result amounted to EUR 0.7 million  7.3 percent of net sales. In the fourth quarter  the result was reduced by the weakening of the US dollar against the euro  the high price of electricity and higher personnel costs related to the company‚Äôs growth. Exchange rates weakened the fourth-quarter operating result by EUR 0.3 million. Increased inflation is reflected in Aspocomp‚Äôs costs. We strive to transfer the cost increase due to changes in the business environment to our product prices.Aspocomp‚Äôs Board of Directors proposes to the Annual General Meeting 2023 that a dividend of EUR 0.21 per share be paid for the financial year 2022 (EUR 0.15 per share for the financial year 2021).Inflation and interest rates  the risk of recession and the uncertainties posed by the Russian war of aggression affect the operating environment of the company and its customers in the financial year 2023. The cycle of the Semiconductor Industry segment is expected to return to growth in the second half of the year. We estimate that Aspocomp‚Äôs net sales for 2023 will increase from 2022 and its operating result for 2023 will be at the same level as in 2022. In 2022  net sales amounted to EUR 39.1 million and the operating result to EUR 4.5 million.‚ÄùNET SALES AND EARNINGSOctober-December 2022Fourth-quarter net sales amounted to EUR 10.1 (10.8) million. Net sales decreased by 6 percent compared to the previous year after some customer orders were transferred to the current fiscal year.The Semiconductor Industry customer segment‚Äôs net sales doubled to EUR 4.5 (2.1) million during the fourth quarter.The Industrial Electronics customer segment‚Äôs net sales decreased by 45% to EUR 1.1 (1.9) million during the fourth quarter due to the slowing effect of inflation and the threat of recession on customer investments.The Security  Defense and Aerospace customer segment‚Äôs net sales decreased by 22% to EUR 1.6 (2.0) million. In the customer segment  activity increased significantly  but the order cycles are long  and the results are visible with a delay.The Automotive customer segment‚Äôs net sales decreased by 50% to EUR 1.8 (3.6) million. As expected  the Automotive customer segment‚Äôs sales decreased in the last quarter compared to the corresponding period of the previous year  when customers increased their inventory levels.The Telecommunication customer segment‚Äôs demand increased by 10% to EUR 1.1 (1.0) million. The net sales of the customer segment remained moderate due to the phases of the customers‚Äô product development projects.The five largest customers accounted for 58% (54%) of net sales. In geographical terms  69% (84%) of net sales were generated in Europe and 31% (16%) on other continents.The operating result for the fourth quarter amounted to EUR 0.7 (1.2) million. In the last quarter  the result decreased due to the weakening of the US dollar against the euro  the high price of electricity and higher personnel costs related to the company‚Äôs growth. Exchange rates weakened the operating profit of the last quarter by EUR 0.3 million. Fourth-quarter operating result was 7.3% (11.5%) of net sales.Net financial expenses amounted to EUR 0.0 (0.0) million. The result of the review period amounted to EUR -0.2 (1.1) million. The result of the review period was affected by the use of losses confirmed in taxation. The related reduction of the deferred tax asset has no cash flow effect. Earnings per share were EUR -0.02 (0.17).January-December 2022January-December 2022 net sales amounted to EUR 39.1 (33.2) million  a year-on-year increase of 18 percent.The Semiconductor Industry customer segment‚Äôs net sales grew to EUR 15.9 (6.2) million. Strong demand in the entire semiconductor industry came to an end in the second half of 2022.The Industrial Electronics customer segment‚Äôs net sales decreased by 26% to EUR 5.5 (7.5) million due to the slowing effect of inflation and the threat of recession on customer investments.The Security  Defense and Aerospace customer segment‚Äôs net sales increased by 1% to EUR 6.1 (6.1) million. The changing geopolitical environment and the increase in defense procurements increased the demand for local manufacturing in Europe.The Automotive customer segment‚Äôs demand declined by 24%  with net sales remaining at EUR 6.8 (8.9) million. Growth in the Automotive segment was limited by a shortage of components and extended delivery times.The Telecommunication customer segment‚Äôs net sales amounted to EUR 4.7 (4.5) million  a year-on-year increase of 5%. Product development needs remained at the previous year‚Äôs level.The five largest customers accounted for 53 (48) percent of net sales. In geographical terms  89 (84) percent of net sales were generated in Europe and 11 (16) percent on other continents.January-December 2022 operating result amounted to EUR 4.5 (2.2) million. The operating result was 11.5 (6.8) percent of net sales. The improvement in operating result was mainly due to the growth in net sales and the increase in the share of technologically more demanding and profitable PCBs in the product mix.Net financial expenses amounted to EUR 0.0 (0.0) million. Earnings per share were EUR 0.52 (0.31).The order book at the end of the review period was EUR 14.3 (16.5) million. The order book decreased by EUR 2.2 million from the comparison period  as the orders are scheduled for a shorter period than before due to the normalization of the production supplies market and the general improvement in availability.THE GROUP'S KEY FIGURES 10-12/22 10-12/21 Change 1-12/22 1-12/21 Change Net sales  M‚Ç¨ 10.1 10.8 -6 % 39.1 33.2 18 % EBITDA  M‚Ç¨ 1.2 1.7 -26 % 6.4 4.1 58 % Operating result  M‚Ç¨ 0.7 1.2 -40 % 4.5 2.2 101 % % of net sales 7% 12% -4 ppts 12% 7% 5 ppts Pre-tax profit/loss  M‚Ç¨ 0.7 1.2 -44 % 4.4 2.2 100 % % of net sales 7% 11% -5 ppts 11% 7% 5 ppts Profit/loss for the period  M‚Ç¨ -0.2 1.1 -114 % 3.5 2.1 68 % % of net sales -2% 11% -12 ppts 9% 6% 3 ppts Earnings per share  ‚Ç¨ -0.02 0.17 -112 % 0.52 0.31 68 % Investments  M‚Ç¨ 0.7 0.4 60 % 2.5 1.3 94 % % of net sales 7% 4% 3 ppts 6% 4% 3 ppts Cash  end of the period 1.4 2.6 -122 % 1.4 2.6 -122 % Equity / share  ‚Ç¨ 3.19 2.80 39 % 3.19 2.80 39 % Equity ratio  % 69% 61% 9 ppts 69% 61% 9 ppts Gearing  % 8% 9% -1 ppts 8% 9% -1 ppts Personnel  end of the period 156 145 11 persons 156 145 11 persons * The total may deviate from the sum totals due to rounding up and down.INVESTMENTSInvestments during the review period amounted to EUR 2.5 (1.3) million. The company has continued its investments to increase capacity in line with its strategy  but the installation of equipment has been slowed down in part due to delays in material and component deliveries caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The investments were focused on upgrading the capacity of the Oulu plant  improving automation  and increasing production efficiency.In 2017  Aspocomp launched an investment program amounting to a total of EUR 10 million to further strengthen its position as a strategic partner to leading companies in the semiconductor  automotive  defense and aerospace  and telecommunications (5G) industries. The second phase of investments was launched in the spring of 2020  when the company was granted a total of EUR 1.35 million in development support by the ELY Center  corresponding to about 25 percent of its total cost. The ongoing second phase of the investment program aims in particular to increase the capacity of the Oulu plant  improve automation and increase production efficiency. In this current program  which will run until the end of the third quarter of 2023  all of the new equipment will be installed in the existing Oulu plant building and no additional plant space will be built.CASH FLOW AND FINANCINGJanuary-December 2022 cash flow from operations amounted to EUR 3.6 (2.3) million.

Nominee-registered shares accounted for 0.8% of the total shares.SHARE-BASED LONG-TERM INCENTIVE SCHEMEThe Board of Directors of Aspocomp Group Plc decided on the establishment of a share-based long-term incentive scheme for the company‚Äôs top management and selected key employees on July 20  2022. The objectives of the Performance Share Plan are to align the interests of Aspocomp‚Äôs management with those of the company‚Äôs shareholders and  thereby promote shareholder value creation in the long term as well as to commit the management to achieving Aspocomp‚Äôs strategic targets.The Performance Share Plan consists of annually commencing individual performance share plans. The commencement of each new plan is subject to a separate decision of Aspocomp‚Äôs Board of Directors. Each plan comprises a performance period followed by the payment of the potential share rewards in listed shares of Aspocomp. The payment of the rewards is conditional on the achievement of the performance targets set by the Board of Directors for the respective plan.The performance period of the first plan  PSP 2022-2024  covers the period from the beginning of July 2022 until the end of the year 2024. Eligible for participation in PSP 2022-2024 are approximately 20 individuals  including the members of Aspocomp‚Äôs Management Team.The share rewards potentially payable thereunder will be paid during the first half of the year 2025. The performance measures based on which the potential share rewards under PSP 2022-2024 will be paid are cumulative EBIT and the total shareholder return of Aspocomp‚Äôs share (absolute TSR).If all the performance targets set for the first plan  PSP 2022‚Äì2024  are fully achieved  the aggregate maximum number of shares to be paid as a reward based on this plan is approximately 92 000 shares (referring to gross earnings before the withholding of the applicable payroll tax).SHAREHOLDERS‚Äô NOMINATION BOARDAspocomp‚Äôs Annual General Meeting held on April 26  2022  decided on the appointment of the Shareholders‚Äô Nomination Board. Based on the company‚Äôs list of shareholders dated September 1  2022  the three largest shareholders were defined  who appointed the following members to the Nomination Board:-P√§ivi Marttila  appointed by Etola Group and Erkki Etola-Ky√∂sti Kakkonen  appointed by Joensuun Kauppa ja Kone Oy-Mikko Montonen  representing himself.The Nomination Board submits proposals regarding the company‚Äôs Board members and their fees to the 2023 Annual General Meeting. The proposals are announced in the AGM notice.ASSESSMENT OF SHORT-TERM BUSINESS RISKSA major share of Aspocomp‚Äôs net sales is generated by quick-turn deliveries and R&D series  and thus the company‚Äôs order book is short. The company's aim is to systematically expand its services to cover the PCB needs of customers over the entire life cycle and thereby balance out variations in demand and the order book.Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the electronics supply chainThe COVID-19 pandemic may affect the availability of parts and components required by electronic assemblers  primarily from China  which would weaken demand.Risks affecting the operating environmentRussia‚Äôs war against Ukraine and the sanctions imposed on Russia in response are not expected to have a significant direct impact on the company. Aspocomp has no business operations and no direct customers or suppliers in Russia  Belarus or Ukraine. However  the changed operating environment may affect our sourcing and logistics chains.The geopolitical situation and the COVID-19 pandemic have increased the risks related to customers‚Äô global supply chains. Weak economic development  inflation and rising interest rates cause uncertainty in the operating environment and may affect customer demand. Cyber risks and disruptions in information systems can affect production. Disturbances in the labor market can also affect production and delivery capacity.Dependence on key customersAspocomp‚Äôs customer base is concentrated; approximately half of sales are generated by five key customers. This exposes the company to significant fluctuations in demand.Market trendsAlthough Aspocomp is a marginal player in the global electronics market  changes in global PCB demand also have an impact on the company‚Äôs business. Competition for quick-turn deliveries and short production series will accelerate as the market for PCBs weakens and continues to have a negative impact on both total demand and market prices.Aspocomp‚Äôs main market area comprises Northern and Central Europe. In case Aspocomp‚Äôs clients would transfer their R&D and manufacturing out of Europe  demand for Aspocomp‚Äôs offerings might weaken significantly.BOARD OF DIRECTORS‚Äô DIVIDEND PROPOSAL AND ANNUAL GENERAL MEETINGAccording to the financial statements dated December 31  2022 the parent company‚Äôs distributable earnings amounted to EUR 9 542 884.91  of which the retained earnings were EUR 6 517 665.13.The Board of Directors will propose to the Annual General Meeting to be held on April 20  2023  that a dividend of EUR 0.21 per share be paid. The dividend would be paid to shareholders registered in the Register of Shareholders maintained by Euroclear Finland Ltd on the record date of the dividend distribution  April 24  2023. The Board of Directors proposes that the dividend will be paid on May 2  2023.There have been no significant changes in the company‚Äôs financial position since the close of the financial period. According to the Board of Directors  the proposed dividend distribution does not endanger the company‚Äôs financial standing.EVENTS AFTER THE FINANCIAL PERIODOn February 15  2022  the Board of Directors of Aspocomp Group Plc approved commencement of a new performance period within the share-based long-term incentive scheme for the company‚Äôs top management and selected key employees  the Performance Share Plan (also ‚ÄúPSP‚Äù): Aspocomp Group originally announced the establishment of the long-term incentive scheme with a stock exchange release issued on July 20  2022.The next plan within the PSP structure  PSP 2023-2025  commences as of the beginning of 2023 and the share rewards potentially earned thereunder will be paid during H1 2026.

The cycle of the Semiconductor Industry segment is expected to return to growth in the second half of the year.Aspocomp estimates that its net sales for 2023 will increase from 2022 and its operating result for 2023 will be at the same level as in 2022. In 2022  net sales amounted to EUR 39.1 million and the operating result to EUR 4.5 million.CEO‚ÄôS REVIEW‚Äú2022 was the best financial year in the history of Aspocomp in its current form. Full year net sales grew by 18 percent to EUR 39.1 million. However  in the last quarter of the year  net sales decreased by 6 percent compared to the previous year after a few individual customer orders were pushed back to the current fiscal year.The flattening of the demand for information and communication technology equipment  which was strongly accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic  is slowing down the cycle of the semiconductor industry. The temporary slowdown in the cycle is typical for the industry. Now it also involves an increase in inventory levels in different parts of the supply chain  mainly due to availability problems. The development of Aspocomp‚Äôs net sales in the last quarter reflected the decline in the semiconductor industry‚Äôs strong demand at the end of 2022. The industry‚Äôs long-term growth prospects are still strong. We expect inventory levels to normalize  investment to pick up and the cycle to turn upward again in the second half of 2023.Despite the slowdown of the cycle in the last quarter  Aspocomp‚Äôs Semiconductor Industry customer segment‚Äôs full-year net sales grew by 158 percent. As expected  the Automotive customer segment‚Äôs sales decreased in the last quarter compared to the corresponding period of the previous year  when customers increased their inventory levels. Aspocomp gained dozens of new customers during the year  especially in the Security  Defense and Aerospace customer segment. Order cycles are typically long in this segment  so we expect net sales growth to materialize with a delay.Our order book amounted to EUR 14.3 million. The order book decreased by EUR 2.2 million from the comparison period because the orders are scheduled for a shorter period than before due to the normalization of the production supplies market and the general improvement in availability.Aspocomp‚Äôs operating result for the entire fiscal year 2022 was excellent  amounting to EUR 4.5 million. The operating result was 11.5 percent of net sales  while the fourth-quarter operating result amounted to EUR 0.7 million  7.3 percent of net sales. In the fourth quarter  the result was reduced by the weakening of the US dollar against the euro  the high price of electricity and higher personnel costs related to the company‚Äôs growth. Exchange rates weakened the fourth-quarter operating result by EUR 0.3 million. Increased inflation is reflected in Aspocomp‚Äôs costs. We strive to transfer the cost increase due to changes in the business environment to our product prices.Aspocomp‚Äôs Board of Directors proposes to the Annual General Meeting 2023 that a dividend of EUR 0.21 per share be paid for the financial year 2022 (EUR 0.15 per share for the financial year 2021).Inflation and interest rates  the risk of recession and the uncertainties posed by the Russian war of aggression affect the operating environment of the company and its customers in the financial year 2023. The cycle of the Semiconductor Industry segment is expected to return to growth in the second half of the year. We estimate that Aspocomp‚Äôs net sales for 2023 will increase from 2022 and its operating result for 2023 will be at the same level as in 2022. In 2022  net sales amounted to EUR 39.1 million and the operating result to EUR 4.5 million.‚ÄùNET SALES AND EARNINGSOctober-December 2022Fourth-quarter net sales amounted to EUR 10.1 (10.8) million. Net sales decreased by 6 percent compared to the previous year after some customer orders were transferred to the current fiscal year.The Semiconductor Industry customer segment‚Äôs net sales doubled to EUR 4.5 (2.1) million during the fourth quarter.The Industrial Electronics customer segment‚Äôs net sales decreased by 45% to EUR 1.1 (1.9) million during the fourth quarter due to the slowing effect of inflation and the threat of recession on customer investments.The Security  Defense and Aerospace customer segment‚Äôs net sales decreased by 22% to EUR 1.6 (2.0) million. In the customer segment  activity increased significantly  but the order cycles are long  and the results are visible with a delay.The Automotive customer segment‚Äôs net sales decreased by 50% to EUR 1.8 (3.6) million. As expected  the Automotive customer segment‚Äôs sales decreased in the last quarter compared to the corresponding period of the previous year  when customers increased their inventory levels.The Telecommunication customer segment‚Äôs demand increased by 10% to EUR 1.1 (1.0) million. The net sales of the customer segment remained moderate due to the phases of the customers‚Äô product development projects.The five largest customers accounted for 58% (54%) of net sales. In geographical terms  69% (84%) of net sales were generated in Europe and 31% (16%) on other continents.The operating result for the fourth quarter amounted to EUR 0.7 (1.2) million. In the last quarter  the result decreased due to the weakening of the US dollar against the euro  the high price of electricity and higher personnel costs related to the company‚Äôs growth. Exchange rates weakened the operating profit of the last quarter by EUR 0.3 million. Fourth-quarter operating result was 7.3% (11.5%) of net sales.Net financial expenses amounted to EUR 0.0 (0.0) million. The result of the review period amounted to EUR -0.2 (1.1) million. The result of the review period was affected by the use of losses confirmed in taxation. The related reduction of the deferred tax asset has no cash flow effect. Earnings per share were EUR -0.02 (0.17).January-December 2022January-December 2022 net sales amounted to EUR 39.1 (33.2) million  a year-on-year increase of 18 percent.The Semiconductor Industry customer segment‚Äôs net sales grew to EUR 15.9 (6.2) million. Strong demand in the entire semiconductor industry came to an end in the second half of 2022.The Industrial Electronics customer segment‚Äôs net sales decreased by 26% to EUR 5.5 (7.5) million due to the slowing effect of inflation and the threat of recession on customer investments.The Security  Defense and Aerospace customer segment‚Äôs net sales increased by 1% to EUR 6.1 (6.1) million. The changing geopolitical environment and the increase in defense procurements increased the demand for local manufacturing in Europe.The Automotive customer segment‚Äôs demand declined by 24%  with net sales remaining at EUR 6.8 (8.9) million. Growth in the Automotive segment was limited by a shortage of components and extended delivery times.The Telecommunication customer segment‚Äôs net sales amounted to EUR 4.7 (4.5) million  a year-on-year increase of 5%. Product development needs remained at the previous year‚Äôs level.The five largest customers accounted for 53 (48) percent of net sales. In geographical terms  89 (84) percent of net sales were generated in Europe and 11 (16) percent on other continents.January-December 2022 operating result amounted to EUR 4.5 (2.2) million. The operating result was 11.5 (6.8) percent of net sales. The improvement in operating result was mainly due to the growth in net sales and the increase in the share of technologically more demanding and profitable PCBs in the product mix.Net financial expenses amounted to EUR 0.0 (0.0) million. Earnings per share were EUR 0.52 (0.31).The order book at the end of the review period was EUR 14.3 (16.5) million. The order book decreased by EUR 2.2 million from the comparison period  as the orders are scheduled for a shorter period than before due to the normalization of the production supplies market and the general improvement in availability.THE GROUP'S KEY FIGURES 10-12/22 10-12/21 Change 1-12/22 1-12/21 Change Net sales  M‚Ç¨ 10.1 10.8 -6 % 39.1 33.2 18 % EBITDA  M‚Ç¨ 1.2 1.7 -26 % 6.4 4.1 58 % Operating result  M‚Ç¨ 0.7 1.2 -40 % 4.5 2.2 101 % % of net sales 7% 12% -4 ppts 12% 7% 5 ppts Pre-tax profit/loss  M‚Ç¨ 0.7 1.2 -44 % 4.4 2.2 100 % % of net sales 7% 11% -5 ppts 11% 7% 5 ppts Profit/loss for the period  M‚Ç¨ -0.2 1.1 -114 % 3.5 2.1 68 % % of net sales -2% 11% -12 ppts 9% 6% 3 ppts Earnings per share  ‚Ç¨ -0.02 0.17 -112 % 0.52 0.31 68 % Investments  M‚Ç¨ 0.7 0.4 60 % 2.5 1.3 94 % % of net sales 7% 4% 3 ppts 6% 4% 3 ppts Cash  end of the period 1.4 2.6 -122 % 1.4 2.6 -122 % Equity / share  ‚Ç¨ 3.19 2.80 39 % 3.19 2.80 39 % Equity ratio  % 69% 61% 9 ppts 69% 61% 9 ppts Gearing  % 8% 9% -1 ppts 8% 9% -1 ppts Personnel  end of the period 156 145 11 persons 156 145 11 persons * The total may deviate from the sum totals due to rounding up and down.INVESTMENTSInvestments during the review period amounted to EUR 2.5 (1.3) million. The company has continued its investments to increase capacity in line with its strategy  but the installation of equipment has been slowed down in part due to delays in material and component deliveries caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The investments were focused on upgrading the capacity of the Oulu plant  improving automation  and increasing production efficiency.In 2017  Aspocomp launched an investment program amounting to a total of EUR 10 million to further strengthen its position as a strategic partner to leading companies in the semiconductor  automotive  defense and aerospace  and telecommunications (5G) industries. The second phase of investments was launched in the spring of 2020  when the company was granted a total of EUR 1.35 million in development support by the ELY Center  corresponding to about 25 percent of its total cost. The ongoing second phase of the investment program aims in particular to increase the capacity of the Oulu plant  improve automation and increase production efficiency.

The objectives of the Performance Share Plan are to align the interests of Aspocomp‚Äôs management with those of the company‚Äôs shareholders and  thereby promote shareholder value creation in the long term as well as to commit the management to achieving Aspocomp‚Äôs strategic targets.The Performance Share Plan consists of annually commencing individual performance share plans. The commencement of each new plan is subject to a separate decision of Aspocomp‚Äôs Board of Directors. Each plan comprises a performance period followed by the payment of the potential share rewards in listed shares of Aspocomp. The payment of the rewards is conditional on the achievement of the performance targets set by the Board of Directors for the respective plan.The performance period of the first plan  PSP 2022-2024  covers the period from the beginning of July 2022 until the end of the year 2024. Eligible for participation in PSP 2022-2024 are approximately 20 individuals  including the members of Aspocomp‚Äôs Management Team.The share rewards potentially payable thereunder will be paid during the first half of the year 2025. The performance measures based on which the potential share rewards under PSP 2022-2024 will be paid are cumulative EBIT and the total shareholder return of Aspocomp‚Äôs share (absolute TSR).If all the performance targets set for the first plan  PSP 2022‚Äì2024  are fully achieved  the aggregate maximum number of shares to be paid as a reward based on this plan is approximately 92 000 shares (referring to gross earnings before the withholding of the applicable payroll tax).SHAREHOLDERS‚Äô NOMINATION BOARDAspocomp‚Äôs Annual General Meeting held on April 26  2022  decided on the appointment of the Shareholders‚Äô Nomination Board. Based on the company‚Äôs list of shareholders dated September 1  2022  the three largest shareholders were defined  who appointed the following members to the Nomination Board:-P√§ivi Marttila  appointed by Etola Group and Erkki Etola-Ky√∂sti Kakkonen  appointed by Joensuun Kauppa ja Kone Oy-Mikko Montonen  representing himself.The Nomination Board submits proposals regarding the company‚Äôs Board members and their fees to the 2023 Annual General Meeting. The proposals are announced in the AGM notice.ASSESSMENT OF SHORT-TERM BUSINESS RISKSA major share of Aspocomp‚Äôs net sales is generated by quick-turn deliveries and R&D series  and thus the company‚Äôs order book is short. The company's aim is to systematically expand its services to cover the PCB needs of customers over the entire life cycle and thereby balance out variations in demand and the order book.Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the electronics supply chainThe COVID-19 pandemic may affect the availability of parts and components required by electronic assemblers  primarily from China  which would weaken demand.Risks affecting the operating environmentRussia‚Äôs war against Ukraine and the sanctions imposed on Russia in response are not expected to have a significant direct impact on the company. Aspocomp has no business operations and no direct customers or suppliers in Russia  Belarus or Ukraine. However  the changed operating environment may affect our sourcing and logistics chains.The geopolitical situation and the COVID-19 pandemic have increased the risks related to customers‚Äô global supply chains. Weak economic development  inflation and rising interest rates cause uncertainty in the operating environment and may affect customer demand. Cyber risks and disruptions in information systems can affect production. Disturbances in the labor market can also affect production and delivery capacity.Dependence on key customersAspocomp‚Äôs customer base is concentrated; approximately half of sales are generated by five key customers. This exposes the company to significant fluctuations in demand.Market trendsAlthough Aspocomp is a marginal player in the global electronics market  changes in global PCB demand also have an impact on the company‚Äôs business. Competition for quick-turn deliveries and short production series will accelerate as the market for PCBs weakens and continues to have a negative impact on both total demand and market prices.Aspocomp‚Äôs main market area comprises Northern and Central Europe. In case Aspocomp‚Äôs clients would transfer their R&D and manufacturing out of Europe  demand for Aspocomp‚Äôs offerings might weaken significantly.BOARD OF DIRECTORS‚Äô DIVIDEND PROPOSAL AND ANNUAL GENERAL MEETINGAccording to the financial statements dated December 31  2022 the parent company‚Äôs distributable earnings amounted to EUR 9 542 884.91  of which the retained earnings were EUR 6 517 665.13.The Board of Directors will propose to the Annual General Meeting to be held on April 20  2023  that a dividend of EUR 0.21 per share be paid.

The Board of Directors proposes that the dividend will be paid on May 2  2023.There have been no significant changes in the company‚Äôs financial position since the close of the financial period.

The cycle of the Semiconductor Industry segment is expected to return to growth in the second half of the year.Aspocomp estimates that its net sales for 2023 will increase from 2022 and its operating result for 2023 will be at the same level as in 2022. In 2022  net sales amounted to EUR 39.1 million and the operating result to EUR 4.5 million.CEO‚ÄôS REVIEW‚Äú2022 was the best financial year in the history of Aspocomp in its current form. Full year net sales grew by 18 percent to EUR 39.1 million. However  in the last quarter of the year  net sales decreased by 6 percent compared to the previous year after a few individual customer orders were pushed back to the current fiscal year.The flattening of the demand for information and communication technology equipment  which was strongly accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic  is slowing down the cycle of the semiconductor industry. The temporary slowdown in the cycle is typical for the industry. Now it also involves an increase in inventory levels in different parts of the supply chain  mainly due to availability problems. The development of Aspocomp‚Äôs net sales in the last quarter reflected the decline in the semiconductor industry‚Äôs strong demand at the end of 2022. The industry‚Äôs long-term growth prospects are still strong. We expect inventory levels to normalize  investment to pick up and the cycle to turn upward again in the second half of 2023.Despite the slowdown of the cycle in the last quarter  Aspocomp‚Äôs Semiconductor Industry customer segment‚Äôs full-year net sales grew by 158 percent. As expected  the Automotive customer segment‚Äôs sales decreased in the last quarter compared to the corresponding period of the previous year  when customers increased their inventory levels. Aspocomp gained dozens of new customers during the year  especially in the Security  Defense and Aerospace customer segment. Order cycles are typically long in this segment  so we expect net sales growth to materialize with a delay.Our order book amounted to EUR 14.3 million. The order book decreased by EUR 2.2 million from the comparison period because the orders are scheduled for a shorter period than before due to the normalization of the production supplies market and the general improvement in availability.Aspocomp‚Äôs operating result for the entire fiscal year 2022 was excellent  amounting to EUR 4.5 million. The operating result was 11.5 percent of net sales  while the fourth-quarter operating result amounted to EUR 0.7 million  7.3 percent of net sales. In the fourth quarter  the result was reduced by the weakening of the US dollar against the euro  the high price of electricity and higher personnel costs related to the company‚Äôs growth. Exchange rates weakened the fourth-quarter operating result by EUR 0.3 million. Increased inflation is reflected in Aspocomp‚Äôs costs. We strive to transfer the cost increase due to changes in the business environment to our product prices.Aspocomp‚Äôs Board of Directors proposes to the Annual General Meeting 2023 that a dividend of EUR 0.21 per share be paid for the financial year 2022 (EUR 0.15 per share for the financial year 2021).Inflation and interest rates  the risk of recession and the uncertainties posed by the Russian war of aggression affect the operating environment of the company and its customers in the financial year 2023. The cycle of the Semiconductor Industry segment is expected to return to growth in the second half of the year. We estimate that Aspocomp‚Äôs net sales for 2023 will increase from 2022 and its operating result for 2023 will be at the same level as in 2022. In 2022  net sales amounted to EUR 39.1 million and the operating result to EUR 4.5 million.‚ÄùNET SALES AND EARNINGSOctober-December 2022Fourth-quarter net sales amounted to EUR 10.1 (10.8) million.

The net sales of the customer segment remained moderate due to the phases of the customers‚Äô product development projects.The five largest customers accounted for 58% (54%) of net sales. In geographical terms  69% (84%) of net sales were generated in Europe and 31% (16%) on other continents.The operating result for the fourth quarter amounted to EUR 0.7 (1.2) million. In the last quarter  the result decreased due to the weakening of the US dollar against the euro  the high price of electricity and higher personnel costs related to the company‚Äôs growth.

The changing geopolitical environment and the increase in defense procurements increased the demand for local manufacturing in Europe.The Automotive customer segment‚Äôs demand declined by 24%  with net sales remaining at EUR 6.8 (8.9) million. Growth in the Automotive segment was limited by a shortage of components and extended delivery times.The Telecommunication customer segment‚Äôs net sales amounted to EUR 4.7 (4.5) million  a year-on-year increase of 5%. Product development needs remained at the previous year‚Äôs level.The five largest customers accounted for 53 (48) percent of net sales.

Earnings per share were EUR 0.52 (0.31).The order book at the end of the review period was EUR 14.3 (16.5) million.

The company has continued its investments to increase capacity in line with its strategy  but the installation of equipment has been slowed down in part due to delays in material and component deliveries caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The investments were focused on upgrading the capacity of the Oulu plant  improving automation  and increasing production efficiency.In 2017  Aspocomp launched an investment program amounting to a total of EUR 10 million to further strengthen its position as a strategic partner to leading companies in the semiconductor  automotive  defense and aerospace  and telecommunications (5G) industries. The second phase of investments was launched in the spring of 2020  when the company was granted a total of EUR 1.35 million in development support by the ELY Center  corresponding to about 25 percent of its total cost. The ongoing second phase of the investment program aims in particular to increase the capacity of the Oulu plant  improve automation and increase production efficiency.

The objectives of the Performance Share Plan are to align the interests of Aspocomp‚Äôs management with those of the company‚Äôs shareholders and  thereby promote shareholder value creation in the long term as well as to commit the management to achieving Aspocomp‚Äôs strategic targets.The Performance Share Plan consists of annually commencing individual performance share plans. The commencement of each new plan is subject to a separate decision of Aspocomp‚Äôs Board of Directors. Each plan comprises a performance period followed by the payment of the potential share rewards in listed shares of Aspocomp. The payment of the rewards is conditional on the achievement of the performance targets set by the Board of Directors for the respective plan.The performance period of the first plan  PSP 2022-2024  covers the period from the beginning of July 2022 until the end of the year 2024. Eligible for participation in PSP 2022-2024 are approximately 20 individuals  including the members of Aspocomp‚Äôs Management Team.The share rewards potentially payable thereunder will be paid during the first half of the year 2025. The performance measures based on which the potential share rewards under PSP 2022-2024 will be paid are cumulative EBIT and the total shareholder return of Aspocomp‚Äôs share (absolute TSR).If all the performance targets set for the first plan  PSP 2022‚Äì2024  are fully achieved  the aggregate maximum number of shares to be paid as a reward based on this plan is approximately 92 000 shares (referring to gross earnings before the withholding of the applicable payroll tax).SHAREHOLDERS‚Äô NOMINATION BOARDAspocomp‚Äôs Annual General Meeting held on April 26  2022  decided on the appointment of the Shareholders‚Äô Nomination Board. Based on the company‚Äôs list of shareholders dated September 1  2022  the three largest shareholders were defined  who appointed the following members to the Nomination Board:-P√§ivi Marttila  appointed by Etola Group and Erkki Etola-Ky√∂sti Kakkonen  appointed by Joensuun Kauppa ja Kone Oy-Mikko Montonen  representing himself.The Nomination Board submits proposals regarding the company‚Äôs Board members and their fees to the 2023 Annual General Meeting. The proposals are announced in the AGM notice.ASSESSMENT OF SHORT-TERM BUSINESS RISKSA major share of Aspocomp‚Äôs net sales is generated by quick-turn deliveries and R&D series  and thus the company‚Äôs order book is short. The company's aim is to systematically expand its services to cover the PCB needs of customers over the entire life cycle and thereby balance out variations in demand and the order book.Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the electronics supply chainThe COVID-19 pandemic may affect the availability of parts and components required by electronic assemblers  primarily from China  which would weaken demand.Risks affecting the operating environmentRussia‚Äôs war against Ukraine and the sanctions imposed on Russia in response are not expected to have a significant direct impact on the company. Aspocomp has no business operations and no direct customers or suppliers in Russia  Belarus or Ukraine. However  the changed operating environment may affect our sourcing and logistics chains.The geopolitical situation and the COVID-19 pandemic have increased the risks related to customers‚Äô global supply chains. Weak economic development  inflation and rising interest rates cause uncertainty in the operating environment and may affect customer demand. Cyber risks and disruptions in information systems can affect production. Disturbances in the labor market can also affect production and delivery capacity.Dependence on key customersAspocomp‚Äôs customer base is concentrated; approximately half of sales are generated by five key customers. This exposes the company to significant fluctuations in demand.Market trendsAlthough Aspocomp is a marginal player in the global electronics market  changes in global PCB demand also have an impact on the company‚Äôs business. Competition for quick-turn deliveries and short production series will accelerate as the market for PCBs weakens and continues to have a negative impact on both total demand and market prices.Aspocomp‚Äôs main market area comprises Northern and Central Europe. In case Aspocomp‚Äôs clients would transfer their R&D and manufacturing out of Europe  demand for Aspocomp‚Äôs offerings might weaken significantly.BOARD OF DIRECTORS‚Äô DIVIDEND PROPOSAL AND ANNUAL GENERAL MEETINGAccording to the financial statements dated December 31  2022 the parent company‚Äôs distributable earnings amounted to EUR 9 542 884.91  of which the retained earnings were EUR 6 517 665.13.The Board of Directors will propose to the Annual General Meeting to be held on April 20  2023  that a dividend of EUR 0.21 per share be paid. The dividend would be paid to shareholders registered in the Register of Shareholders maintained by Euroclear Finland Ltd on the record date of the dividend distribution  April 24  2023. The Board of Directors proposes that the dividend will be paid on May 2  2023.There have been no significant changes in the company‚Äôs financial position since the close of the financial period. According to the Board of Directors  the proposed dividend distribution does not endanger the company‚Äôs financial standing.EVENTS AFTER THE FINANCIAL PERIODOn February 15  2022  the Board of Directors of Aspocomp Group Plc approved commencement of a new performance period within the share-based long-term incentive scheme for the company‚Äôs top management and selected key employees  the Performance Share Plan (also ‚ÄúPSP‚Äù): Aspocomp Group originally announced the establishment of the long-term incentive scheme with a stock exchange release issued on July 20  2022.The next plan within the PSP structure  PSP 2023-2025  commences as of the beginning of 2023 and the share rewards potentially earned thereunder will be paid during H1 2026.

Resolution (t)Performance share plan for the senior managementThe Board of Directors has reviewed remuneration for the senior management and concluded that the Company would benefit from a continuation of a performance share plan that complements the stock option plan to further increase the senior management's alignment with long-term shareholder value creation. The Board proposes that the 2023 Annual General Meeting resolves to approve the Board of Directors' proposal regarding a performance share plan to the senior management in Kindred Group which will be used in conjunction with the existing stock option plan (SOP).In the proposed plan  the performance measure is a non-market based condition that provides participants (approximately 109) with a high degree of alignment to Company performance. PSP awards will depend on Kindred achieving financial performance target (i.e. EBITDA) over three financial years establishing a clearer link between how Kindred performs and the value that the PSP can deliver.The suggested performance share plan may in total comprise no more than 0 3% of all issued shares in Kindred annually  and on an accumulated basis the five plans of 2023-2027 will amount to around 1 1% of dilution.Closing of the meetingInformation about proposals related to Agenda itemsAgenda item 2The Nomination Committee will publish the information of its proposal for a Chairman of the AGM 2023 on a later date.Agenda item 8The Board of Directors proposes a dividend of GBP 0.345  which is approximately SEK 4.35 at the exchange rate 12.63 GBP/SEK at 28 February 2023 per SDR/share  to be paid to holders of ordinary shares/ SDRs.

Should any of these shareholders appoint the Chairman of the Board of Directors to the Nomination Committee  the Nomination Committee shall consist of five members. Otherwise  the Chairman of the Board shall be adjunct to the Nomination Committee. The other members shall be appointed by each of the subsequent largest shareholders expressing their willingness to participate in the Nomination Committee  within one week after they have been so asked. At the appointment of a member to the Nomination Committee  it shall be stated which shareholder that has appointed the member in question. Should a shareholder waive its right to appoint a member to the Nomination Committee  the opportunity to appoint a member shall be passed to the following largest shareholder which has already not appointed a member to the Nomination Committee.The members of the Nomination Committee shall appoint the committee chair among themselves. The Chairman of the Board shall not chair the Nomination Committee. The names of the members of the Nomination Committee shall be announced no later than the date of the publication of the Company's interim report for the third quarter of 2023.Should the ownership in the Company change  after the announcement of the Nomination Committee but before the end of the fourth quarter of 2023  to such an extent that the members of the Nomination Committee no longer reflect the shareholding structure as stipulated above  and the Nomination Committee so considers appropriate  the member of the Nomination Committee representing the shareholder with the lesser number of shares in the Company shall resign from the committee and the shareholder who has become the larger shareholder in the Company shall  in the order corresponding to its shareholding in the Company  be offered to appoint a new member to the Nomination Commit-tee.

However  the Nomination Committee shall have the right to engage outside expertise and consultancy services related to its assignments and to ensure their reimbursement by the Company.Agenda item 24Acquisition of Own SharesThe Board of Directors proposes that the acquisition of shares/SDRs shall take place on Nasdaq Stockholm or via an offer to acquire the shares/SDRs to all shareholders. The purchases may take place on multiple occasions and will be based on actual market price and terms  prevailing regulations and the capital situation at any given time. Notification of any purchase will be made to Nasdaq Stockholm and details will appear in the Company's annual report and accounts.The objective of the purchase is to achieve added value for the Company's shareholders (including through the implementation of the share buy-back program previously announced)[1] and to give the Board increased flexibility with the Company's capital structure.Following the purchase  the intention of the Board would be to either cancel  use as consideration for an acquisition or issue to employees under a Share Option programme or Share Performance Scheme.Once purchased under the Maltese Companies Act further shareholder approval will be required before those shares could be cancelled only. Shares/SDRs bought back pursuant to the Company's share buy-back program will be cancelled (refer to Agenda item 26). A separate authorisation for such cancellation is being recommended pursuant to Resolution (s).If used as consideration for an acquisition  the intention would be that the actual shares/SDRs would be offered to any potential transferor.Agenda item 25Share cancellationThe directors may decide to cancel all or some of shares/SDRs acquired pursuant to the buy-back program.The Companies Act (Cap. 386 of the laws of Malta) stipulates that an extraordinary resolution of the shareholders of the Company is required in order to approve the reduction in the issued share capital of the Company.Such resolution needs to be filed with the Registrar of Companies in Malta  who will publish details of such reduction. Creditors of the Company will then have a period of three months during which they can contest the reduction in capital. Upon the lapse of the three-month period  assuming that no contestations are received  the reduction in share capital can become effective.In order to reflect the changes in the issued share capital  a revised memorandum of association of the Company indicating the reduced number of shares then in issue in the capital of the Company will need to be submitted to the Registrar of Companies.The reduction in issued share capital will take place at such intervals and in such amounts (subject to the maximum amount of GBP 14 375) as the directors shall determine from time to time.Agenda item 26Share issueThe objectives of the authorisation to be granted in terms of this resolution are to increase the financial flexibility of the Company and to enable the Company to use its own financial instruments for payment in kind or through a set-off to a selling partner in connection with any business acquisitions the Company may undertake or to settle any deferred payments in connection with business acquisitions. The market value of the shares/SDRs on each issue date that will be used in determining the price at which shares/SDRs will be issued  should be the same as the market value of the shares/SDRs listed on Nasdaq Stockholm. A cap of 23 million ordinary shares/SDRs in the Company is being requested in connection with this authorisation. The cap will be reduced by the amount of any shares/SDRs bought back and held by the Company excluding however any shares/SDRs held by the Company from the said calculation.Agenda item 27Performance share plan for the senior managementThe Board of Directors has reviewed remuneration for the senior management and concluded that the Company would benefit from a continuation of a performance share plan that complements the stock option plan to further increase the senior management's alignment with long-term shareholder value creation. The Board proposes that the 2023 Annual General Meeting resolves to approve the Board of Directors' proposal regarding a performance share plan to the senior management in Kindred Group which will be used in conjunction with the existing stock option plan (SOP).In the proposed plan  the performance measure is a non-market based condition that provides participants (approximately 109) with a high degree of alignment to Company performance.

Other participants are divided into two categories depending on seniority  each comprising approximately 15 persons  who shall be offered a maximum of 10 000 and 5 000 call options  respectively  per person.d) If a participant refrains in full or in part from acquiring offered call options  such un-acquired call options shall be allocated on a pro rata basis between those participants who have  in writing  expressed their interest in acquiring additional call options. Participants are not entitled in this manner to acquire more than an additional 30 per cent of the original number of call options offered.e) The call options shall be allotted against payment in accordance with the Board of Directors‚Äô resolution to the CEO  senior executives and other key employees within the Bufab group  in accordance with the guidelines stated in items c) and d) above. Allotment is expected to take place during the second or third quarter 2023.f) Allotment of call options according to item e) shall be made at market value calculated by Ernst & Young AB as an independent valuation institute  applying the Black & Scholes valuation method. The calculation is based on the variables risk-free interest rate  volatility  the term of the call options  expected dividends during the term of the call options  current share price and the acquisition price for shares when exercising the call options (strike price). Since the call options are acquired at market price  no criteria for allocation in the Program are established.g) The issuance of call options to employees outside of Sweden is dependent on tax effects  that there is no legal impediment  and that the Board of Directors determines that such allocation can be carried out with reasonable administrative and financial resources. The Board of Directors shall be entitled to make such minor amendments to the Program as required by applicable foreign legislation and regulations.h) The call options are freely transferable.i) The number of shares which the call options bring entitlement to acquire  as well as the exercise price  may be recalculated as a result of e.g. bonus issues  revers splits or splits of shares  new share issues  a reduction of the share capital  or similar actions. The time of transfer of shares may be brought forward as a result of any merger or similar actions.j) In order to encourage participation in the Program  the Board of Directors is authorised to resolve on a subsidy in the form of gross salary additions  maximum corresponding to the premium paid for each call option. In such cases  the subsidy will be paid in June 2026  subject to the participant at such point in time is remaining in his/her employment or another corresponding employment within the Bufab group and still holding call options. If a participant has disposed a part of its call options  the participant should receive a subsidy maximum corresponding to the premium paid for the call options held by the participant at the time of payment.k) The Company has the right but not any obligation to  on its own or through a third party  repurchase call options at a price corresponding to no more than the market value  with the purpose of facilitating the participant's exercise of the remaining call options acquired under the Program. However  call options may not be repurchased during any such period when trading in the Company‚Äôs shares is prohibited in accordance with Article 19 of the market abuse regulation or any other equivalent legislation which applies at any given time.l) The Board of Directors shall  within the framework of the above terms and conditions  be responsible for the preparation and management of the Program.(B) Resolution on authorisation of the Board of Directors to resolve on repurchase of own sharesIn order to hedge Bufab‚Äôs delivery of shares to the participants of the Program  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to authorise the Board of Directors to acquire  during the period until the next Annual General Meeting  a maximum of 210 000 shares in the Company. Acquisition shall be made on Nasdaq Stockholm in accordance with stock exchange regulations at a price within the registered price interval from time to time  which is the interval between the highest purchase price and the lowest sale price. Acquired shares shall be paid in cash and acquisitions may be made on one or several occasions.(C) Resolution on transfer of repurchased shares to participants of the Company‚Äôs incentive programsThe Board of Directors‚Äô proposal also implies that the Annual General Meeting approves that the Company  with deviation from the shareholders‚Äô preferential right  transfer a maximum of 210 000 of the Company‚Äôs repurchased shares to the participants of the Program at the fixed exercise price (subject to any recalculation). Transfer shall take place during the time the participants have the right to exercise call options to acquire shares in accordance with the terms and conditions for the Program. The reason for deviation from the shareholders‚Äô preferential right at transfer of own shares is to enable Bufab to deliver shares in the Company to the participants of the Program.Shares that have been acquired by the Company  and which are not transferred to participants in the Program may be transferred to participants in previous incentive programs or future incentive programs decided on by the General Meeting of the Company. Also such shares acquired by the Company within previous years' incentive programs may be transferred to participants in the Program  previous incentive programs or future incentive programs decided on by the General Meeting. Transfer shall take place in accordance with applicable rules for the current incentive program.Dilution  costs and impact on important key ratiosThe Program does not cause any dilution of the existing shareholders‚Äô share of the votes and capital in the Company since it is based on call options for shares already issued by the Company. The Program corresponds to approximately 0.6 per cent of the total number of shares and votes in the Company. Based on actual participation in the 2020  2021 and 2022 incentive programs  these programs correspond  together with the Program proposed for the Annual General Meeting 2023  to a total of 1.6 per cent of the total number of shares and votes in the Company.The costs of the Program consist of the subsidy that during June 2026 may be paid as per the above  the social security charges payable on this subsidy and the financing costs for repurchased shares. The total cost has been estimated to approximately MSEK 12 after corporation tax over the duration of the Program. To be compared with the subsidy  the option premium which the Company will receive on transfer of the call options corresponds to a total of approximately MSEK 11.During its duration  the Program will impact the key ratio earnings per share positively through the Company‚Äôs repurchase of shares and negatively because of the Company‚Äôs transfer of the repurchased shares to the participants in the Program. The net effect on the key ratio earnings per share will be maximum 0.6% during the duration of the Program. The cost for the Company‚Äôs repurchase of own shares is estimated to amount to approximately MSEK 60 and will affect the cash flow  liquidity and equity in connection with the repurchase during the duration of the Program. After the duration of the Program  the above effects are expected to be neutralised. The Program is considered to only result in immaterial impact on other important key ratios.Reason for the Program and its preparationSince 2017  the Company has  after a resolution by the Annual General Meeting each year  implemented a yearly recurring long-term incentive program comprising call options  on terms and conditions in all material aspects corresponding to the proposed Program. In the Board of Directors‚Äô assessment  the previously resolved incentive programs have so far fulfilled their purposes. Therefore  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting 2023 resolves on a corresponding incentive program. The reason for implementing the Program is that key employees within the Bufab group should be able to benefit from and strive for  through their own investment  an increase in the price of the Company‚Äôs shares  thus more closely aligning the interests of key employees and the Company‚Äôs shareholders. The purposes of the Program is also to contribute towards key employees increasing their long-term shareholding in Bufab. The Program is also expected to create conditions for retaining and recruiting competent personnel for the Bufab group  to provide competitive remuneration and to align the interest of the executive management and shareholders. The Board of Directors considers that the Program is reasonable in scope and cost effective. The key employees included in the Program is the group of persons that  in an otherwise heavily decentralised organisation  can create positive effects for the Bufab group. On the basis of this  the Board of Directors believes that the Program has a positive effect on the continued development of the Bufab-group  and that the Program benefits both the shareholders and the Company.The proposal for the Program has been prepared by the Company‚Äôs Remuneration Committee in consultation with the Board of Directors of the Company. The Company‚Äôs management has not been involved in the preparation. The resolution to propose the Program to the Annual General Meeting has been taken by the Board of Directors. Members of the Board of the Company are not included in the Program.Majority requirementThe Board of Directors‚Äô proposal pursuant to items 19 (A) ‚Äì (C) above shall be resolved on as one resolution with application of the majority rules in Chapter 16 of the Swedish Companies Act  meaning that shareholders representing at least nine-tenths of both the votes cast and shares represented at the meeting must support the resolution.Resolution on authorization to transfer shares in the Company (item 20)The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorizes the Board of Directors to  on one or more occasions during the period up until the next Annual General Meeting  resolve upon transfer of the Company‚Äôs own shares according to the following terms.The maximum number of shares to be transferred may not exceed the number of own shares held by the Company at the time of the Board of Directors‚Äô resolution  provided that the Company always holds such a number of shares that the Company needs to ensure delivery of shares under the Company's ongoing call option-based incentive programs (including any recalculation).Transfer of the Company‚Äôs own shares may only take place on Nasdaq Stockholm at a price within the share price interval registered at each point in time  meaning the interval between the highest purchase price and the lowest selling price.The purpose of the authorization is to enable the Company to transfer such shares that the Company has repurchased in order to ensure delivery of shares within the framework of one of the Company‚Äôs call option-based incentive programs  but which  partly as a result of the structure of the incentive programs  have not been used for delivery of shares to participants in such incentive programs.The resolution by the meeting requires the support of shareholders representing at least two thirds of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the meeting.E. NUMBER OF SHARES AND VOTES IN THE COMPANYAt the time of the issue of this convening notice  the total number of shares in the Company amounts to 38 110 533 shares corresponding to 38 110 533 votes in total. Of these shares  381 363 are held in treasury and may not be represented at the Annual General Meeting.F. RIGHT TO REQUEST INFORMATIONThe Board of Directors and the CEO shall  upon request of a shareholder  and if the Board of Directors deems this can be done without causing material harm to the Company  inform about matters which might affect the assessment of an item on the agenda or about Bufab¬¥s or its subsidiaries¬¥ financial situation or about Bufab¬¥s relation to another group entity in relation to the consolidated financial statements.G. AVAILABLE DOCUMENTSThe Nomination Committee‚Äôs reasoned statement  form of proxy and postal voting form are available at the Company and on the Company‚Äôs website  www.bufabgroup.com.The annual report and the audit report as well as the Board of Directors‚Äô complete proposals pursuant to items 9b (including the Board of Directors‚Äô reasoned statement pursuant to Chapter 18  Section 4 of the Swedish Companies Act)  18 (including statement from the auditor pursuant to Chapter 8  Section 54 of the Swedish Companies Act)  19-20  as well as the Nomination Committee‚Äôs proposals pursuant to items 2 and 11-17  will be available at the Company and at the Company¬¥s website; www.bufabgroup.com  no later than on 30 March 2023.The documents will be sent free of charge to shareholders who so request and state their address.H.

In Asia  stock benchmarks gained  Treasury yields were mixed; the dollar edged lower; while oil futures and gold advanced.Equities:European stock futures rose early Friday  tracking gains on Wall Street  and as fears of a rolling banking crisis eased after after 11 of the U.S.'s biggest banks on Thursday deposited $30 billion to prop up First Republic Bank.Worries about risk in the banking sector following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and two other U.S. lenders have weighed on markets over the past week.""We certainly are on alert and watching for signals that the stress can permeate across asset classes and industries and leak into the real economy  which it certainly will "" said Adam Abbas  co-head of fixed income at Harris Associates.""There will be knock-on effects.""In light of the market volatility  federal-funds futures point to an 80% chance that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates by a quarter-percentage point next week. A week ago  wagers reflected only a one-third odds of such an increase  suggesting a larger half-percentage point raise was more likely.The ECB's decision to plow through with a half-point hike despite the turmoil in the banking sector is being seen as offering a potential model for the Fed  according to analysts.""Here's the challenge-if they go with 50 basis points  I would say that they are probably not being sensitive enough to some of the stressors that are obviously impacting the banks "" said Gerry Goldberg  chief executive at GYL Financial Synergies.""If they do nothing  while some might be relieved  it may also be interpreted by the broader market as  'Wait a second  if they are pausing  maybe we should have greater concern.'""Mr. Goldberg said he believes that leaves the Fed with the option of raising rates by quarter-percentage point.Forex:The dollar edged lower early Friday amid a mild risk-on mood.A U.S. banking-industry-wide rescue to shore up ailing First Republic Bank has given some much-needed reassurances to market participants  said IG.This news has helped to calm market nerves in an extremely bearish risk environment  it added.""It's pretty fascinating given the chaos we've seen in fixed income and yields "" Oanda said.""We're on standby until we get to the March 22 meeting "" it said.""Haven flows into the yen has been one of the clearer trades over this period. Now we're going to see if risk appetite comes back even more  and that could weigh on the dollar. You may see European currencies get a nice rebound here.""Bonds:Treasury yields were mixed as markets look more convinced that the Fed will raise rates next week instead of taking a pause.""The Fed's goal is getting inflation in check and stabilizing the labor market. Neither of these are directly impacted by the SVB [Silicon Valley Bank] situation. SVB is a result of Fed tightening  however  the direct response is likely contained to a small subset of the market -- primarily VC backed companies. The decline of VC backed companies will likely not have a significant impact on inflation or the labor market in the US economy "" said Austin Graff  co-chief investment officer and portfolio manager of the TrueShares Low Volatility Equity Income ETF.""The Fed wants to avoid a stop/start process to rate hikes so we probably won't see the Fed change their course on rates until there is more clear data that inflation and the labor market are closer to desired levels "" Graff said.""Many strategists are forecasting key interest rate cuts later this year  but that seems very premature to me "" Louis Navellier  from Navellier & Associates said.Energy:Oil futures were higher in Asia  amid positive market sentiment  spurred by news that eleven U.S. banks have deposited $30 billion to support ailing First Republic Bank.However  an increase in U.S. crude-oil inventories adds fuel to recent sell off in oil  said DailyFX.com  noting EIA data showing weekly crude-oil stockpiles rose more than expected.Crude was pressured in recent sessions as banking woes amplified recession worries.""Global recession risks have never been greater and that is bad news for the crude demand outlook. The initial move lower for crude however might not last as traders might grow confident this will be the last rate hike for the ECB and that next week the Fed will stop after delivering one more "" Oanda said.Metals:Gold prices rose early Friday  as traders sought safety in haven assets.Fresh concerns emerged about the financial sector  as First Republic Bank plunged  with the lender said to be exploring a sale  ANZ analysts said  adding that markets will carefully watch next week's Fed meeting.""The risk environment is still treading on some cautious optimism while 'dovish' rate expectations also remain supportive of the yellow metal "" IG said.--Copper prices rose early Friday buoyed by strong China data released earlier this week.Data showed that growth in fixed asset investments in China was picking up after the Lunar New Year  said ANZ analysts.Property investment in China has risen more-than-expected over January and February  ANZ added.--Chinese iron-ore futures gained  with some analysts warning of the ferrous metal's high valuation.The production of iron melt is unlikely to exceed last year's level  and steel mills are cautious of adding iron ore stock  Donghai Futures analysts said.They also expect iron ore supply to rebound in 2Q  which might further weigh on prices.TODAY'S TOP HEADLINESEleven Banks Deposit $30 Billion in First Republic BankThe biggest banks in the U.S. swooped in to rescue First Republic Bank with a flood of cash totaling $30 billion  in an effort to stop a spreading panic following a pair of recent bank failures.The bank's executives came together in recent days to formulate the plan  discussing it with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and other officials and regulators in Washington  D.C.  people familiar with the matter said.Don't Bet on a Fed Pause. Why a Rate Hike Is Still Likely.Turmoil in the banking sector went global on Wednesday  sending equity markets tumbling and sparking renewed calls for the Federal Reserve to pause its monetary-policy tightening efforts when officials meet next week.Despite widespread market volatility over the past several days  however  inflation remains well above the Fed's 2% target  particularly in the most-worrisome services sector  and the macroeconomic outlook so far is mostly unchanged. That suggests to many economists that the central bank  in its quest to balance its dual priorities of financial stability and price stability  is still likely to raise rates by a modest quarter of a percentage point when officials meet for their March policy meeting next week.U.S. stocks set for wild swings as trillions in options contracts set to expire FridayU.S. stocks could see increasingly wild swings in the coming days as option contracts tied to trillions of dollars in securities are set to expire on Friday  removing a buffer that some say has helped to keep the S&P 500 index from breaking out of a tight trading range.Option contracts worth $2.8 trillion are set to expire during Friday's ""quadruple witching"" event  according to figures from Goldman Sachs Group GS.Bursting Bubble Is Expected to Curb 2023 BonusesBonuses for private-equity executives will fall again this year after declining across much of the industry in 2022  with the heaviest cuts seen for smaller and midsize firms  according to Alan Johnson  managing director of Wall Street compensation consulting firm Johnson Associates Inc.However  the largest buyout shops may escape unscathed  he said.Poland Says Russian Spies Sought to Sabotage Western Arms Transfers to UkraineWARSAW-Poland's domestic security agency detained nine foreigners suspected of planning to sabotage Western weapons shipments to Ukraine  in the largest known attempt by Russia to target arms deliveries from within Europe.Interior Minister Mariusz Kami≈Ñski said Thursday that the nine people  who have been detained in recent days  had been paid by Russian special services.China's Foreign Minister Talks With Ukraine Counterpart as Xi Plans Moscow TripChina's foreign minister on Thursday spoke by telephone with his Ukrainian counterpart as Beijing continues to signal its desire to play a part in ending that country's war with Russia.Qin Gang  the Chinese official  spoke with Ukraine's Dmytro Kuleba  both governments confirmed.U.N.

Only the top 8% of companies who disclosed information for the full climate questionnaire achieved a place on the CDP Supplier Engagement Leaderboard.The CDP Supplier Engagement assessment complements the CDP results published in December 2022  in which Atos secured a place on CDP‚Äôs A List for tackling climate change. CDP‚Äôs annual environmental disclosure and scoring process is widely recognized as the gold standard of corporate environmental transparency.Atos Procurement‚Äôs objective is to have as much of its spend as possible with sustainable and green suppliers  and therefore aims to work with suppliers that are assessed by EcoVadis. In 2022  70% of total Atos Group spend was covered by such suppliers. Atos is also using an internal maturity assessment to understand suppliers‚Äô maturity from a decarbonization perspective. For those suppliers that have no sufficient carbon reduction program in place  Atos works to support them on their decarbonization journey. Atos suppliers can demonstrate their commitment to fight climate change by signing a dedicated contract clause with Atos  from which they commit to start measuring and reporting their emissions and commit to a globally recognized climate change related target. Atos also collects actual emissions data from its suppliers to calculate its own scope 3 emissions.Additionally  Atos itself  has received an EcoVadis Platinum Award for its performance in Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)  thereby confirming its position in the top 1% of companies assessed by EcoVadis in its Industry (Computer programming  consultancy and related activities). EcoVadis evaluates across four categories: Environment  Labor & Human Rights  Ethics  and Sustainable Procurement. Atos has achieved excellent results in all four categories  particularly in Environment.Story continuesAtos‚Äô commitment is also reinforced by its client DLAs (Decarbonization Level Agreements).

In many cases we have been informed by the end users that they hold warrants alongside DCAC Ordinary Shares.

Full-year capex of USD 832 million was 2.9% higher than in 2021  with capex intensity up 1.1 p.p. as the company invested in 4G network expansion. Total cash and cash equivalents were USD 3.1 billion  with USD 2.5 billion held at the HQ level.Commenting on the results  Kaan Terzioƒülu said: ‚ÄúIn the final quarter of 2022  we added further operational momentum and recorded double-digit local currency revenue growth in five of our countries  doubling the growth rate from a year ago. With our Russian operations now classified as ‚Äòheld for sale‚Äô and ‚Äòdiscontinued operations‚Äô and not contributing to Group revenues  VEON‚Äôs topline growth in local currency for the full year 2022 was 14.0%. Furthermore  the sale of Russia will result in the significant deleveraging of the Group balance sheet. While we are smaller in size  we are now a faster growing company  serving emerging markets with strong potential demand for the services that VEON‚Äôs Digital Operator 1440 model offers.Story continuesIn 2022  each of our operations achieved significant growth  both in terms of financial performance and the operational metrics that underpin our business. Our local operating companies collectively added 14 million 4G customers  bringing 4G-powered digital ‚Äòmultiplay‚Äô users to 22% of our subscriber base while growing ARPU and customer engagement by providing more relevant connected services for our core telecom users. This strong operational performance has continued and YTD February 2023 local currency revenues are up by 15.2% YoY and local currency EBITDA up by 11.8% YoY. With continued focus on operational performance as well as financial discipline and liquidity management  including our strong liquidity position at year-end  we are well positioned to deliver growth while significantly deleveraging VEON‚Äôs balance sheet and enhancing VEON‚Äôs credit profile in 2023.‚ÄùQ4 2022 highlightsRevenue of USD 940 million  -4.9% YoY (+18.6% YoY in local currency)Service revenue of USD 901 million  -4.4% YoY (+19.2% YoY in local currency)Data and digital revenues of USD 474 million  -7.5% YoY (+15.8% YoY in local currency)EBITDA of USD 453 million  +1.2% YoY (+30.1% YoY in local currency)Capex of USD 263 million  -5.1% YoY  with capex intensity of 22.1%Total cash and cash equivalents of USD 3.1 billion  +37.9% YoY  with USD 2.5 billion at Headquarters157 million mobile subscribers  up 2.7% YoY85 million 4G users  up 19.4% YoY  with 53.9% penetration of customer baseFY 2022 highlightsRevenue of USD 3 755 million  -2.4% YoY (+14.0% YoY in local currency)Service revenue of USD 3 600 million  -2.4% YoY (+13.9% YoY in local currency)Data and digital revenues of USD 1 937 million  -0.7% YoY (+16.5% YoY in local currency)EBITDA of USD 453 million  -5.3% YoY (+12.6% YoY in local currency)Capex of USD 832 million  +2.9% YoY  with capex intensity of 22.1%Total cash and cash equivalents of USD 3.1 billion  +37.9% YoY  with USD 2.5 billion at Headquarters157 million mobile subscribers  up 2.7% YoY85 million 4G users  up 19.4% YoY  with 53.9% penetration of customer baseIn 4Q22  VEON accelerated local currency revenue & EBITDA growth and continued to gain market share in each of its markets. The Group maintained strong liquidity  with Group cash and cash equivalents of USD 3.1 billion as of 31 December 2022.Total Group revenues decreased by 4.9% YoY during 4Q22 in reported currency and increased by 18.6% in local currency terms  with Ukraine revenues growing 8.7% YoY in local currency and all other countries reporting double-digit local currency revenue growth for the period. Service revenues decreased by 4.4% YoY in reported currency and rose by 19.2% YoY in local currency.In 4Q22  Group EBITDA increased by 1.2% YoY in reported currency terms (+30.1% in local currency)  with Group EBITDA margin of 48.2% (+2.9 p.p. YoY). Energy costs increased across the Group +c.30% YoY negatively impacting Group EBITDA margin. We remain focused on implementing planned cost-efficiency measures across the Group and on applying inflationary pricing across our operations. Project Optimum delivered c.USD 95 million of savings in 2022 with cost intensity improving by 2.5 p.p. YoY in local currency.The Group‚Äôs YoY revenues and EBITDA performance was impacted by several extraordinary non-recurring items in 4Q22 and in 4Q21  as noted in the Country Performance section. Excluding these one-off items  Group total revenue increased by 15.4% YoY  service revenue increased by 15.8% YoY and EBITDA increased by 7.4% YoY in local currency.In 4Q22  we reported subscriber base growth of 2.7% YoY. The Group continued to focus on overall customer experience  seeing improving Net Promoter Score (‚ÄúNPS‚Äù) across most of the countries. This supported a 19.4% YoY increase in 4G users  which reached 84.6 million  with 13.8 million users added during the year. As of 31 December 2022  4G subscribers accounted for 53.9% of our total subscriber base  up 7.5 p.p. from a year earlier supporting the execution of VEON‚Äôs Digital Operator strategy.Each of our operations have increased their ARPU levels YoY as they delivered a broader range of services to their customers  achieving greater wallet shares while also implementing inflationary pricing.Our operating companies continued to execute VEON‚Äôs Digital Operator strategy (‚ÄúDO1440‚Äù)  aiming to deliver digital experiences for every minute of the day powered by high-quality mobile internet connectivity. On the back of our growing 4G penetration and with increasing usage of our digital services  we have expanded our multiplay customer base by 40.3% YoY  with 28.4 million multiplay customers at the end of December. While representing just 22% of the user base  multiplay customers were the source of 38.6% of VEON‚Äôs B2C revenues. Multiplay customer ARPU is 3.6 times higher  and churn is 0.4 times lower than for single play voice-only customers.Media streaming services Toffee in Bangladesh and Tamasha in Pakistan were among key drivers of growth in multiplay  as well as our overall digital offering. Toffee in Bangladesh reached 21.2 million monthly active users (‚ÄúMAUs‚Äù) in December 2022  a 3.3-fold YoY increase  with 5.2 million average daily users (5.0 times higher YoY).

At 22.1%  capex intensity increased marginally by 1.1 p.p. YoY  primarily due to adverse FX rate movements. We closed the fourth quarter with total cash of USD 3.1 billion  including USD 2.5 billion at the HQ level. Our operations remain largely self-funding.In Ukraine  the team continued to work to keep the country connected  with around 90% of our radio network operational at the end of the quarter. However  over the course of the quarter  damage to Ukrainian power infrastructure impacted network availability at times. Kyivstar‚Äôs revenues were up 8.7% YoY in local currency (-20.7% YoY in reported currency); the Ukrainian hryvnia‚Äôs forex performance negatively impacted reported currency growth rates. Kyivstar‚Äôs 4G customer base grew 8.2% YoY  and our customers consumed more data  with data usage rising 26.3% YoY. EBITDA decreased by 7.3% YoY in local currency (-32.4% YoY in reported currency) in 4Q22. EBITDA performance was impacted by the change in revenue mix impacting margins  operational cost pressures including energy costs  indexation of frequency fees  as well as by charitable donations and the staff care program  as Kyivstar continues to support its employees and the community.Pakistan revenues rose 24.3% YoY in local currency (-2.6% YoY in reported currency)  driven by strong growth in data revenue  despite the negative impact of the increase in withholding tax from 10% to 15% on 16 January 2022  and the further reduction in mobile termination rates from PKR 0.70 last year to PKR 0.40 from 01 July 2022. The weakness in the Pakistani rupee negatively impacted financial performance in reported currency. Jazz grew its subscriber base (+1.5% YoY)  4G users (+17.9% YoY) and ARPU (+22.0% YoY) in 4Q22. EBITDA in Pakistan rose by 86.9% YoY in local currency (+46.9% YoY in reported currency). Revenue and EBITDA performance in 4Q22 was positively impacted by the reversal of a provision following a favorable decision from the Islamabad High Court on pending litigation  increasing recorded revenues by PKR 6.6 billion (c.USD 30 million) and EBITDA by PKR 20.2 billion (c.USD 91 million). Higher energy prices in Pakistan negatively impacted EBITDA margin by c.4 p.p.In Kazakhstan  revenues increased 20.0% YoY in local currency (+10.2% YoY in reported currency)  another quarter of strong growth supported by further expansion of our mobile customer base (+6.8% YoY)  higher data usage (+19.2% YoY) and inflationary pricing of tariffs. This was the seventh consecutive quarter of local-currency revenue YoY growth above 20%  while Beeline Kazakhstan reached 68.3% 4G penetration in the customer base (+4.7 p.p. YoY). EBITDA rose by 7.0% YoY in local currency terms (-1.6% YoY in reported currency).In Bangladesh  Banglalink‚Äôs revenues increased 16.9% YoY in local currency (-2.5% YoY in reported currency). This was the third quarter of double-digit local currency revenue growth. Banglalink‚Äôs execution of its Digital Operator strategy  4G focus and nation-wide expansion continue to deliver results  with the rising number of data and  in particular  4G users  driving growth in data consumption. Banglalink reported balanced expansion of its subscriber base (+7.1% YoY) and ARPU (+5.0% YoY) in 4Q22. EBITDA decreased 9.7% YoY in local currency (-24.7% YoY in reported currency) impacted by the higher network related costs and minimum tax on gross revenue paid in 4Q22.In Uzbekistan  revenues increased 30.3% YoY in local currency (+25.3% YoY in reported currency)  a sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth and a fourth consecutive quarter of revenue growth above 20%. This was driven by a 28.4% YoY expansion in the 4G subscriber base and a solid increase in data revenues  which were 38.9% higher YoY. EBITDA rose 14.4% YoY in local currency (+10.0% YoY in reported currency).As VEON Group strengthens its position for accelerating growth  our 2023 local currency guidance for both revenue and EBITDA is growth of 10%-14%.

As such  you should not place undue reliance on this information. This information may not be indicative of the actual results for any future period.The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the sanctions imposed by the United States  member states of the European Union  the European Union itself  the United Kingdom  Ukraine and certain other nations  counter-sanctions by Russia and other legal and regulatory responses  as well as responses by our service providers  partners  suppliers and other counterparties  and the consequences of all of the foregoing have impacted and  if the conflict  sanctions and such responses continue or escalate  may significantly impact our results and aspects of our operations in Russia and Ukraine  and may significantly affect our results and aspects of our operations in the other countries in which we operate. We are closely monitoring events in Russia and Ukraine  as well as the possibility of the imposition of further sanctions in connection with the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and any resulting further rise in tensions between Russia and the United States  the United Kingdom and/or the European Union. Although our Russian operations are now classified as ‚Äòheld for sale‚Äô and ‚Äòdiscontinued operations‚Äô and do not contribute to our comparison base or actual reported numbers in this release (except as specifically stated)  our operations in Ukraine continue to be affected by the conflict. We hope that there will be a peaceful and amicable resolution and are doing everything we can to protect the safety of our employees  while continuing to ensure the uninterrupted operation of our communications  financial and digital services.The comprehensive sanctions on investment and vendors in Russia and the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine have had and may continue to have a significant impact on the Company‚Äôs operations and business plans in Russia and Ukraine. During the twelve months-ended 31 December 2022  we have recorded significant impairment charges related to the Russian and Ukrainian operations. We may need to record future impairment charges  which could be significant if the conflict continues or escalates and as more information becomes available to management. It is possible further impairment charges may rise to such a level on an accounting basis as to require additional analysis of true asset values in order to determine the true value of assets to be compared to liabilities as outlined in the provisions of our debt agreements.Due to the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the consequences as mentioned above  the Company requires additional time to complete all necessary disclosures in its Annual Report on Form 20-F to be filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (‚ÄúU.S. SEC‚Äù) as well as its Dutch financial statements to be filed with the Autoriteit Financi√´le Markten (‚ÄúAFM‚Äù)  including completing its preparation of VEON‚Äôs consolidated financial statements and subsequently receiving the related audit report on the financial statements and internal control over financial reporting from its independent registered public accounting firm.

Sanofi announces that it will cut the list price of Lantus (insulin glargine injection) 100 Units/mL  its most widely prescribed insulin in the U.S.  by 78 percent. The company also will establish a $35 cap on out-of-pocket costs for Lantus for all patients with commercial insurance  underscoring its longstanding commitment to offer affordable access to medicines.These moves  which go into effect January 1  2024  will come in addition to decisions taken in June 2022 to lower diabetes medicines costs: the launch of an unbranded Lantus biologic at -60% versus Lantus list price  and a cap on out-of-pocket costs on insulin to $35 for all people without insurance. With all those decisions  now Sanofi‚Äôs suite of savings programs ensures that no patient will pay more than $35 for a monthly supply of Lantus. Finally  Sanofi will also cut the list price of its short-acting Apidra (insulin glulisine injection) 100 Units/mL by 70%.Olivier BogillotHead  U.S. General Medicines  Sanofi‚ÄúSanofi believes that no one should struggle to pay for their insulin and we are proud of our continued actions to improve access and affordability for millions of patients for many years. We launched our unbranded biologic for Lantus at 60 percent less than the Lantus list price in June 2022 but  despite this pioneering low-price approach  the health system was unable to take advantage of it due to its inherent structural challenges. We are pleased to see others join our efforts to help patients as we now accelerate the transformation of the U.S. insulin market. Our decision to cut the list price of our lead insulin needs to be coupled with broader change to the overall system to actually drive savings for patients at the pharmacy counter.‚ÄùSanofi Savings ProgramsStory continuesSanofi will continue to provide different programs to ensure access and affordability to patients depending on their coverage situations and will continue to monitor policy and market changes. Our suite of innovative programs includes:100% of commercially insured people are eligible for Sanofi‚Äôs copay assistance programs  regardless of income or insurance plan design  which  in 2022 limited out-of-pocket expenses for a majority of participating patients to $15 or less for their diabetes medicines for a 30-day supply.100% of uninsured people are eligible for the Insulins Valyou Savings Program ‚Äì regardless of income level ‚Äì enabling them to buy one or multiple Sanofi insulins at $35 for a 30-day supply. The Soliqua (insulin glargine and lixisenatide) injection 100 Units/mL and 33 mcg/mL cash offer also allows uninsured people to pay as little as $99 per box of pens  for up to two boxes of pens for a 30-day supply.We also provide free medications to qualified low- and middle-income patients the Sanofi Patient Connection program. Some people facing an unexpected financial hardship may be eligible for a one-time  immediate month‚Äôs supply of their Sanofi medicine as they wait for their application to process.Beginning in 2023  Sanofi insulins and Soliqua are included under the Inflation Reduction Act  where covered on Medicare formulary  which provides insulin savings  capping monthly cost at $35 for Seniors who have Medicare Part D. This ensures a predictable  stable co-pay  regardless of phase including the donut hole. Prior to the Inflation Reduction Act  Sanofi voluntarily participated in part of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services‚Äô (CMS) Senior Savings Model which allowed patients enrolled in participating Part D plans to pay a $35 or less co-pay for each 30-day prescription of a Sanofi insulin throughout the year.Every patient has unique circumstances  and Sanofi has live support specialists who can be reached at (855) 984-6302 to answer individual patient‚Äôs questions and navigate their unique situation to find the best resources and programs to help lower their out-of-pocket costs.Learn more about Sanofi‚Äôs transparent approach to pricing in our 2023 Pricing Principles Report.About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people‚Äôs lives.

20705,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/biosenic-delivers-post-hoc-analysis-060000561.html,BioSenic delivers a new post-hoc analysis of its Phase III JTA-004 trial on knee osteo-arthritis with positive action on the most severely affected patient population,REGULATED INFORMATION New analysis and formal identification of patient subsets open up further potential clinical development options for JTA-004 Mont-Saint...,"BioSenicREGULATED INFORMATIONNew analysis and formal identification of patient subsets open up further potential clinical development options for JTA-004Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium  March 16  2023  7am CET - BIOSENIC (Euronext Brussels and Paris: BIOS)  the clinical stage company specializing in severe autoimmune/inflammatory diseases and cellular repair  announces today it has re-evaluated the results of its Phase III trial of its enhanced viscosupplement JTA-004 targeting knee osteoarthritis (OA).BioSenic has obtained new statistical analysis results from the JTA-004 Phase III clinical trial data  released in August 2021. The multicenter  randomized  double blind  placebo- and active-controlled Phase III study was conducted in 7 European countries and Hong Kong and included a total of 743 patients. The study did not meet the primary and consequently the key secondary endpoints  despite JTA-004‚Äôs favorable safety profile. The final report was recently communicated to EudraCT (2019-000796-16).In March 2022  in the journal ‚ÄòAnnals of the Rheumatic Diseases‚Äô1  a peer-reviewed paper formally identified three subtypes of OA  amongst which a subtype of OA patients with more severe symptoms and inflammation. A better understanding of disease stratification to classify patients with OA provided the input for this fresh  in-depth post hoc analysis. BioSenic has used the statistical analysis capabilities of Artialis to study the results of the Phase III JTA-004 trial in the subset of patients with the most painful and inflammatory form of OA. This allowed BioSenic to distinguish a group of patients  representing about one third of the total patients  who show a pain-relieving effect of JTA-004 not only superior to placebo but also to the active comparator.By identifying three subtypes of OA  amongst which a subtype of OA patients with more severe symptoms and inflammation  this new post-hoc analysis changes the therapeutic profile of the molecule and potentially allows for the possibility of stratifying patients for a new  optimized Phase III clinical study. BioSenic  which does not intend to allocate R&D resources to support the clinical development of JTA-004 and will continue to focus its R&D activities on the development of its autoimmune (ATO) and cell therapy (ALLOB) platforms  is now seeking to collaborate with existing and potential partners to explore options for the future development of JTA-004 based on this new post-hoc analysis.Following the data of the Arthritis Foundation  OA is now recognized as a disease of the whole joint  affecting more than 32.5 million adults in the United States. By far the most common form of arthritis  OA does not yet have any drugs that can slow or modify the disease and only offers transitory relief of symptoms.Story continuesJTA-004 was designed as a next generation of intra-articular injectable for the treatment of osteoarthritic pain in the knee. Consisting of a unique patented mix of plasma proteins  hyaluronic acid - a natural component of knee synovial fluid  and a fast-acting analgesic  JTA-004 was designed to provide added lubrication and protection to the cartilage of the arthritic joint and to alleviate OA pain.""These new data demonstrate that JTA-004 may have the potential to provide an improved treatment for the most affected osteoarthritis patients that suffer from severe chronic pain and active  mostly progressive  inflammatory disease that is an under-served medical need "" said Fran√ßois Rieger  PhD  BioSenic's Chairman and CEO. ""As a result  this opens up fresh options for BioSenic in addition to our current multiple autoimmune and cell therapy platforms. BioSenic will formally publish the fresh JTA-004 post hoc analysis results in a peer-reviewed paper in the second half of 2023 and will meanwhile explore multiple options for the further development of JTA  with potential partnership options and potential additional clinical development.‚ÄùAbout BioSenicBioSenic is a biotech company focused on (i) the development of innovative products to address high unmet needs in orthopedics and (ii) exploiting the possibilities offered by the therapeutic use of arsenic salts (mainly arsenic trioxide (ATO) for patients with autoimmune diseases. Key target indications for the platforms include Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD)  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) and high-risk tibial fractures and other orthopedics indications  such as osteoarthritis  by combining new and tested  IP protected  techniques.Following the merger in October 2022  BioSenic combines the strategic positionings and strengths of Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics. The merger also enables Biosenic to add to its innovative cell therapy platform and strong IP for tissue repair or protection with an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/OATO.BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About BioSenic technology platformsBioSenic‚Äôs technology is based on two main platforms:1) The allogeneic cell and gene therapy platform  developed by BioSenic with differentiated bone marrow sourced Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) that can be stored at the point of use in hospitals. Its current investigational medicinal product  ALLOB  represents a unique  proprietary approach to organ repair and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells on the site of injury after a single local injection. These cells are produced via a BioSenic's scalable manufacturing process. Following the CTA approval by regulatory authorities in Europe  BioSenic has initiated patient recruitment for the Phase IIb clinical trial with ALLOB in patients with difficult tibial fractures  using its optimized production process. ALLOB is currently being evaluated in a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase IIb study in patients with high-risk tibial fractures  using its optimized production process  after a successful first safety and efficacy study (Phase 1/2a) on fractured long bones  with late delayed union. The patient recruitment has been halted late February 2023 with 57 patients and the new rules permitted for statistical analysis should allow BioSenic to get the main results of this trial much earlier than anticipated in the original protocol  since they are expected by mid-2023.2) The Arsenic TriOxide (ATO) platform developed by Medsenic. The immunomodulatory properties of ATO have demonstrated a double basic effect on cells of the immune system. The first effect is the increase of the cell oxidative stress in activated B  T or other cells of the innate/adaptative immune system to the point they will enter a cell death program (apoptosis) and be eliminated. The second effect is potent immunomodulatory properties on several pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in inflammatory or autoimmune cell pathways. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. GvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). GvHD is primarily mediated by the transplanted immune system that can lead to severe multiorgan damage. Medsenic had been successful in a Phase II trial with its intravenous formulation  allowing arsenic trioxide to be granted an orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA and is heading towards an international Phase III confirmatory study  with a new  IP protected  oral (OATO) formulation.Moderate to Severe forms of Systemic Lupus erythematosus (SLE) is another selected target  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastro-intestinal tract) in a Phase IIa study.Systemic Sclerosis is  in addition  part of the clinical pipeline of BioSenic. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive. This gives good grounds to launch a Phase II clinical protocol for this serious disease that badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and with no actual current effective treatment.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAPr.

Frequent customers want to take advantage of their travel to feel unique and valued. Ac...,The ALL ‚Äì Accor Live Limitless program reinforces its portfolio of tailored subscription cards with its ALL PLUS frequent traveler offerings to provide customers with subscription cards that best meet their global and local travel needs.Adapting To Changing Travel HabitsAs the subscription economy booms  more and more hospitality brands are looking at subscription-based models to drive loyalty. Frequent customers want to take advantage of their travel to feel unique and valued.Accor strives to be as close as possible to guests  with the aim of meeting their high expectations  adapting to a mix of global and local travel and anticipating evolving needs and desires. According to the Skift Report  the line between work and leisure is blurring . And locals are often just as keen as global travelers to use the experiences offered by a program like ALL.To be relevant and drive real added value  subscription cards are an opportunity for loyalty programs but need to adapt to changing travel habits and guest behavior. For travelers who travel more frequently and for longer periods of time  we launched the Business PLUS and ibis Business cards  which are now reinvented as ALL PLUS Voyageur and ALL PLUS ibis to reinforce their added value and better meet our guests needs and expectations.ALL PLUS  a Key Value DriverALL PLUS Voyageur and ALL PLUS ibis subscription cards are tailored to our most valuable guests and offer two value boosters: biggest discounts and a status accelerator. In addition to earning Reward points  guests also enjoy the best fixed discount available all year long and earn Status points enabling them to move up their status tiers and an elite status. Since both cards are fully part of ALL  all earned points are cumulated in their ALL account and allow members to benefit from the rich value proposition of ALL.Ultimately  these subscription cards create a virtuous circle for both our guests and hotels: the more our guests spend in our ALL ecosystem  the more points  status  discounts and exclusive benefits they gain to live more limitless experiences. At the same time  hotels then have more loyal and engaged guests who generate more revenue and provide more knowledge and opportunities to build stronger relationships.Meeting Local Needs and Expectations with Regional ALL PLUS cardsIn addition to the ALL PLUS Voyageur and ALL PLUS ibis cards in order to elevate guest experience  keep driving real added value  and build lasting loyalty  we are enriching the ALL subscription cards portfolio  as are its customer needs and expectations  with tailored regional ALL PLUS products aligned to market specificities.Off the back of our industry acclaimed loyalty program  ALL - Accor Live Limitless  we wanted to craft regional subscription products which would resonate with today‚Äôs traveler. These cards provide access to our best hospitality brands at the highest rational value when booking on ALL.com or App. MEHDI HEMICI  Chief Loyalty & E-Commerce OfficerAfter 10 years of existence  it was time for paid BUSINESS cards to embrace the bleisure & ‚Äòwork from anywhere‚Äô growing trends. Simpler  stronger and better embedded with the core loyalty program  ALL PLUS provides companies of all size  friends  couples and families the best way to enjoy 4 000 properties across 100 countries. MAXIME GAREAU  Vice President Global Membership SubscriptionBy innovating and adapting  we reinforce connections with clients who frequently travel locally and internationally with different needs and expectations.

The non-IFRS financial measures presented are measures used by management to monitor the underlying performance of the business and operations and  have therefore not been audited or reviewed. Furthermore  they may not be indicative of the historical operating results  nor are they meant to be predictive of future results. These non-IFRS measures are presented because they are considered important supplementary measurements of FL Entertainment N.V.'s (the ""Company"") performance  and we believe that these and similar measures are widely used in the industry in which the Company operates as a way to evaluate a company‚Äôs operating performance and liquidity. Not all companies calculate non-IFRS financial measures in the same manner or on a consistent basis. As a result  these measures and ratios may not be comparable to measures used by other companies under the same or similar names.Regulated information related to this press release is available on the website:https://www.flentertainment.com/results-center/https://www.flentertainment.com/APPENDIXGlossaryTransaction: business combination with Pegasus Entrepreneurial Acquisition Company Europe B.V.  a special purpose acquisition company to become a listed company on Euronext Amsterdam as well as the Group‚Äôs reorganizationAdjusted EBITDA: for a period is defined as the operating profit for that period excluding restructuring costs and other non-core items  costs associated with the long-term incentive plan within the Group (the ""LTIP"") and employment related earn-out and option expenses  and depreciation and amortization (excluding D&A fiction).

20721,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pharming-group-reports-financial-results-060000237.html,Pharming Group reports financial results for full year 2022,Total revenues increased by 3% to US$205.6 million  in line with single digit growth guidance,"LEIDEN  Netherlands  March 16  2023 /PRNewswire/ --Total revenues increased by 3% to US$205.6 million  in line with single digit growth guidanceOperating profit increased by 34% to US$18.2 millionRobust cash flows from operations of US$22.9 million drove overall cash balance from US$193.0 million to US$208.7 millionLeniolisib FDA review remains on track with a PDUFA goal date of March 29  2023Significant investments made in leniolisib launch preparations  organizational structure and pipeline developmentPharming confirms that it has full access to its cash depositsPharming Group N.V. (""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (Euronext Amsterdam: PHARM) (Nasdaq: PHAR) presents its preliminary (unaudited) financial report for the full year ended December 31  2022.Chief Executive Officer  Sijmen de Vries commented:""2022 was a pivotal year for Pharming. It was a year in which we prioritized our efforts in rare diseases and affirmed our commitment to our purpose of serving the unserved rare disease patient. It is this priority and commitment that forms the foundation as we build Pharming into a leading  global rare disease company across multiple geographies  with multiple products  a well-defined pipeline and with the necessary commercial infrastructure in place to enhance our future ambition.Beginning in early 2022  we put into motion a bold strategy and made significant regulatory progress in advancing leniolisib towards marketing approval. In the U.S. and Europe  dossiers were filed and validated  with plans for the U.K. filing in the second half of 2023 remaining on track.We also announced positive Phase 3 clinical trial data for leniolisib with our findings published in Blood  the peer reviewed international medical journal of the American Society of Hematology. This was followed by the presentation of positive interim analysis data from the open label extension study at the 64th American Society Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting.Story continuesIn preparation for the FDA PDUFA goal date of March 29 in the U.S.  and to ensure commercial success with what will be our second marketed product  Pharming began investing significantly in its commercial infrastructure both in the U.S. and Europe from the third quarter. With this ramp up of commercial capabilities  we feel we are well positioned to successfully commercialize leniolisib in the U.S. shortly after receiving a positive decision. Looking to Europe  having those commercial capabilities already in place will be vital to executing our launch strategy following a positive CHMP opinion expected in the second half of 2023 and marketing authorisation expected approximately two months later.To support leniolisib and our broader growth ambitions in the rare disease space  we will continue advancing our pipeline via internal projects  as well as through potential in-licensing or acquisitions. The focus of these potential opportunities would target rare disease assets in mid to-late stage development  including assets with a clinical-proof-of-concept where we feel comfortable taking Phase III clinical risk. Internally  our focus will be additional indications for leniolisib  as well as the advancement of OTL-105 for the treatment of HAE.With a clear foundation laid  and a great start to our strategic execution  we have much to be proud of in 2022. I would like to thank our employees  our partners and suppliers and all of those who worked tirelessly to make this year such a success. We look forward to continuing to execute on our strategic objectives in 2023 as we follow through on Pharming's vision to become a leading  global rare disease company.""Strategic highlightsIn 2022  we prioritized our efforts on rare diseases and executed on a number of our strategic objectives to help build a sustainable global rare disease business focused on RUCONEST¬Æ sales  the approval  launch and commercialization of leniolisib for activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3KŒ¥) syndrome (APDS) in key markets  and the ongoing development and management of our pipeline.We significantly expanded our organization and headcount in 2022  especially in the second half of the year when we added commercial and medical affairs personnel to support market development and to prepare for the anticipated launch and commercialization of leniolisib for APDS. These investments are in line with our strategy to become a global  multi-product  rare disease company.In line with our renewed focus on rare diseases  we are advancing the development of our pipeline through a combination of internal development projects - including the development of additional indications for leniolisib  as well as OTL-105 as a gene therapy for HAE - and the potential acquisition or in-licensing of mid to late-stage assets.Investments in our internal pipeline projects and potential acquisitions and in-licensing will be financed through a combination of positive cash flow from the RUCONEST¬Æ business  anticipated future leniolisib business  and available cash from our strong balance sheet. If required  Pharming may access additional funding from the capital markets.Leniolisib development and commercializationFor leniolisib  Pharming has a three-step approach planned for the coming years.The first step is the anticipated regulatory approval and commercial launch of leniolisib for the treatment of activated PI3K delta syndrome (APDS) in adults and adolescents aged 12 and older in the U.S. during the first half of 2023. This will be followed by key markets in the European Economic Area (EEA) and the U.K.  subject to an anticipated positive CHMP opinion in the second half of 2023. The Company currently plans to pursue regulatory approvals in Japan  Canada  and Australia  and will evaluate additional countries and regions for product expansion  and will commercialize the product either directly or through strategic distribution partnerships.The second step includes clinical development and regulatory approvals to expand the marketing of leniolisib as a treatment for APDS to children as young as one year of age.The third step is the development of leniolisib in additional indications beyond APDS. Prioritization and preclinical testing work is ongoing and we expect to announce further details on our plans to develop leniolisib in additional indications in the second half of 2023.Leniolisib clinical dataIn February 2022  Pharming announced positive results from the pivotal Phase II/III blinded randomized  placebo-controlled registration-enabling study of leniolisib for the treatment of APDS in adults and adolescents aged 12 years or older. Data from this trial was presented at the Clinical Immunology Society 2022 Annual Meeting in April 2022 and published in Blood  the peer-reviewed international medical journal of the American Society of Hematology  in December 2022. Also in December 2022  positive interim analysis data from the open-label extension study evaluating leniolisib as a treatment for adult and adolescent patients 12 years or older with APDS was shared in an oral presentation at the 64th American Society Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting.Addressable global market opportunitiesPharming believes there are more than 1 500 patients with APDS living in the United States  Europe  Japan  Australia  Canada  and Israel. This figure is based on current populations and available literature which estimates the prevalence of the disease to be approximately 1 to 2 patients per million.To date  we have identified more than 500 patients with a confirmed APDS diagnosis in the countries where we intend to initially commercialize leniolisib. These patients have been found through the efforts of our disease educators and patient finders  as well as through our genetic testing partnership with Invitae  which offers free of charge genetic testing to US-based clinicians who believe they may have a patient with APDS. A genetic test enables a clinician to confirm their clinical suspicions and definitively diagnose APDS.U.S. marketIn 2022  the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted for priority review Pharming's New Drug Application (NDA) for leniolisib to treat adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older with APDS. The FDA assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date of March 29  2023. We currently remain on track for the FDA decision on leniolisib  followed by the anticipated commercial launch in the second quarter of 2023.In anticipation of a positive decision by the FDA  in the second half of 2022 we grew our US commercial infrastructure  including our field force  and leveraged our marketing capabilities to prepare for the successful commercialization of leniolisib.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) added a new diagnosis for APDS to the International Classification of Diseases  10th Revision  Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM)  formally recognizing APDS as a discrete immunological disease. The diagnosis code  D81.82 ‚Äí Activated Phosphoinositide 3-kinase Delta Syndrome (APDS)  took effect on October 1  2022. The assignment of the ICD-10-CM code by the CDC enables physicians and payors in the U.S. to add a diagnosis of APDS to patients' health records  which will help connect these individuals with researchers studying the prevalence and course of the disease. In addition  by allocating a specific diagnosis  the new ICD-10-CM code may help confirm medical necessity in individual patients  thus improving their access to relevant care options through U.S. health insurance plans.EEA and U.K. marketIn the EEA  Pharming submitted a marketing authorisation application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for leniolisib as a treatment for APDS in adults and adolescents aged 12 and older. Our dossier was filed and validated by EMA in October 2022 under the accelerated assessment timetable.In February 2023  Pharming Group announced that the EMA's Committee for Human Medicinal Products (CHMP) decided to shift its assessment of the MAA for leniolisib to a standard review timetable. The list of questions received by Pharming from EMA included a request to submit updated data from the ongoing long-term extension study collected after the interim analysis included in the original MAA. We anticipate that the CHMP will issue its opinion on the leniolisib MAA in the second half of 2023 and expect European marketing authorisation approximately two months later.In the U.K. and in line with the European Commission Decision Reliance Procedure (ECDRP)  we intend to file the leniolisib dossier to the U.K.'s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) within five days of a positive CHMP opinion; expected in the second half of 2023.The U.K. government has extended the ECDRP until December 31  2023.JapanIn line with our strategy to expand the reach of our products to rare disease patients  on March 9  2023 we filed an Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) application with the Ministry of Health  Labor and Welfare (MHLW) in Japan. We expect to begin a clinical trial in Japan in second quarter of 2023 for APDS patients aged 12 and older. We currently anticipate marketing leniolisib in Japan directly following regulatory approval.Pediatric clinical developmentPharming has developed a clinical plan to include children as young as one year of age who are afflicted with APDS. During the first half of 2022  positive decisions were received from EMA and the U.K.'s MHRA on the Pediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) for leniolisib as a treatment for APDS in children younger than 12 years of age.In April 2022  the MHRA granted Promising Innovative Medicine (PIM) designation to leniolisib for the treatment of APDS. A PIM designation is an early indication that leniolisib is a candidate for the MHRA's Early Access to Medicines Scheme. This scheme provides an opportunity for treatment options to be used in clinical practice in parallel with the later stages of the regulatory process.The leniolisib PIP includes two planned global clinical trials in pediatric patients with APDS to support regulatory filings worldwide.In February 2023  Pharming announced that the first patient had been enrolled in its Phase III clinical trial evaluating leniolisib in children aged 4 to 11 with APDS at sites in the United States  Europe  and Japan.Leniolisib for additional indications (PI3KŒ¥ technology platform)As we continue to work towards regulatory approvals of leniolisib for APDS in the United States  Europe and the United Kingdom  we have also commenced working towards prioritizing other indications where leniolisib has the potential to deliver value for patients. PI3KŒ¥ has been identified as an important player in a variety of disease states  and leniolisib has demonstrated an attractive  long-term efficacy  safety and tolerability profile in clinical trials conducted in both healthy volunteers and patients. This provides a solid basis for our plans for the investigation and investment in further leniolisib indications Pre-Clinical PipelineOTL-105Pharming has an ongoing strategic collaboration with Orchard Therapeutics to research  develop  manufacture and commercialize OTL-105  a newly disclosed investigational ex vivo autologous hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene therapy for the treatment of hereditary angioedema (HAE). The program has made good progress developing the lentiviral vector to enhance C1-inhibitor expression and is now testing in preclinical HAE disease models. We anticipate providing further updates as we move towards preparing an Investigational New Drug (IND) filing.PompeWe are continuing the preclinical investigation of a next-generation alpha-glucosidase therapy for the treatment of Pompe disease  and are currently evaluating potential differentiating features of our product candidate in these preclinical studies. We expect to update the market on our findings in the second quarter of 2023.Discontinuation of non-rare disease assetsIn line with our strategic decision to focus on rare diseases  we announced at our half year financial results in August 2022 the discontinuation of development of recombinant human C1 esterase inhibitor (rhC1INH) for acute kidney injury (AKI) and pre-eclampsia (PE). In line with this decision  we also announce today that we have stopped further development in the large-scale production of rhC1INH through the use of our transgenic cattle herd program  and have stopped the ongoing Phase IIb clinical trial and we will no longer pursue other strategic options.RUCONEST¬Æ - marketed for the treatment of acute HAE attacksIn 2022  RUCONEST¬Æ returned to positive growth  achieving US$205.6 million in revenues and demonstrating the sustainability of our product for the treatment of acute HAE attacks  first commercialized in the United States in 2014.The United States accounted for the majority of worldwide revenues with US$200.1 million in 2022 compared to US$193.4 million in 2021. From the second quarter onward  we achieved quarter-on-quarter growth in the US market  both in volumes and revenues  reflecting the growing number of patients using RUCONEST¬Æ and physicians prescribing the medication.Revenues within Europe remained stable in spite of strong prophylactic and generic competition.While Pharming faces competition within the HAE market  the continued need for effective and reliable treatments for acute attacks  including breakthrough attacks in patients on prophylactic therapy  as well as RUCONEST¬Æ's distinct advantages as the only recombinant treatment that targets the root cause of HAE by replacing missing or dysfunctional C1-INH  allows for sustainability in RUCONEST¬Æ's revenues.Organizational highlightsPharming's headcount grew significantly in 2022. This growth was seen in commercial  medical and in back office support personnel in preparation for the launch and commercialization of leniolisib in key markets  most of which was in place at the tail end of the third quarter. Pharming will continue investing in its future by building the infrastructure to support the successful launch and commercialization of leniolisib and our other existing and future pipeline programs.Subsequent eventOn March 12 and 13  2023  Pharming issued three press releases regarding the events surrounding Silicon Valley Bank. Pharming confirms that it has full access to its deposits.Full Year 2022 Financial highlightsAmounts in US$m except per share data 2022 2021 % Change Income StatementRevenues 205.6 198.9 3 % Gross profit 188.1 177.7 6 % Operating profit 18.2 13.6 34 % Profit for the year 13.7 16.0 (14) % Balance SheetCash & marketable securities 208.7 193.0 8 % Share InformationBasic earnings per share (US$) 0.021 0.025 (16) % Diluted earnings per share (US$) 0.019 0.023 (17) %Financial ReviewIn 2022  Pharming's revenues increased by 3% to US$205.6 million and operating profit increased by 34% to US$18.2 million. Net profit decreased by 14% to US$13.7 million.This section will further elaborate on Pharming's financial performance in 2022.Revenues and Gross ProfitThe increase in revenues was primarily a result of higher sales of RUCONEST¬Æ in the U.S. market (US$200.1 million in 2022 compared to US$193.4 million in 2021)  which was supported by a price increase below CPI  as well as an increase in physicians prescribing and the number of patients using RUCONEST¬Æ.Revenues in Europe remained the same as last year at US$4.9 million in 2022. Revenue in the rest of the world  excluding Europe  increased to US$0.6 million from US$0.5 million in 2021.Cost of sales decreased by 17% from US$21.1 million in 2021 to US$17.6 million in 2022. Cost of sales related to product sales in 2022 amounted to US$17.4 million compared to US$19.1 million in 2021. The remainder of costs in 2022 (US$0.2 million) stem from impairment charges on inventory designated for commercial activities (2021: US$2.0 million).Gross profit increased by US$10.4 million  or 6%  to US$188.1 million for the year 2022. The main reasons for this increase were higher sales of RUCONEST¬Æ  a favorable currency translation effect and favorable production results.Operating Profit and Other Operating CostsFor 2022  the operating profit increased by US$4.6 million to US$18.2 million compared with US$13.6 million for the prior year. This increase was driven by increased gross profit (US$10.4 million) as mentioned above  increased other income (US$11.9 million) and offset by increased operating costs (US$17.6 million).Other income increased significantly by US$11.9 million in 2022 to US$14.5 million as compared to US$2.6 million in 2021 as Pharming reduced its minority stake in BioConnection from 43.85% to 22.98% in April 2022. As a result of this transaction  Pharming received one-off net cash proceeds of US$7.5 million and recognized a gain of US$12.2 million. This was partly offset by a decrease in government grants on R&D projects  due to Pharming's renewed strategy and pipeline.The operating costs for 2022 increased primarily from additional investments in leniolisib (development  medical affairs  commercial launch preparation). Furthermore  costs for the OTL-105 development increased and impairment costs were incurred from the discontinuation of the development of AKI and the cattle platform. Out of pocket costs of closed programs (Covid 19  PE  and AKI) were reduced versus the previous year.Financial income and expensesOther finance income decreased by US$10.4 million  to US$4.5 million for the year-end December 31  2022. This decrease was primarily caused by fluctuations in the U.S. Dollar versus Euro during 2021 and 2022. This had a particular impact on the bank balances due to our net cash position.During 2022  Pharming reduced its currency translation exposure causing the decrease of currency translation income in 2022 as compared to 2021.Other finance expenses decreased by US$0.7 million  from US$6.2 million for year-end December 31  2021 to US$5.5 million for the year ended December 31  2022  mainly caused by currency translation effects.The fair value loss on revaluation (US$1.2 million) relates to fair value adjustments in the BioConnection preference share which is included in Pharming's balance sheet as an investment in equity instruments designated at the Fair Value Through the Statement of Profit and Loss (FVTPL).Income tax expenseIncome tax expense decreased by US$5.8 million from US$7.1 million for the year ended December 31  2021 to US$1.3 million for the year ended December 31  2022  mainly due to the decrease in profit before tax and income from the BioConnection transaction  as mentioned above  being tax exempt.Profit for the yearA total net profit in 2022 of US$13.7 million represented a decrease of 14% over 2021 (US$16.0 million). The decrease was mainly caused by an increase in operating costs - due to company growth - investments in Pharming's product pipeline  decreasing foreign exchange gains and impairment charges on the cancelled downstream production facility. These increased costs were partly offset by an increase in revenues and other income.Intangible assetsIn 2022  intangible assets decreased by US$8.7 million from US$83.8 million in 2021 to US$75.1 million in 2022. The decrease was caused by regular amortization (US$4.3 million) and foreign currency effects (US$5.0 million)  and was partly offset by investments in assets (US$0.6 million).AmortizationThis relates to regular amortization of software and the re-acquired rights related to the acquisition of all North American commercialization rights from Bausch Health in 2016 and the acquisition of all European commercialization and distribution rights from Swedish Orphan International AB (""Sobi"") in 2020. Amortization is charged based on the economic lifetime of the intangible asset. The economic lifetime of the North American commercialization rights from Bausch Health is 20 years  where the economic lifetime of the European commercialization and distribution rights from Swedish Orphan International AB is 12 years. This estimate did not change compared to the previous year.InvestmentsInvestments in intangible assets relate to software. Assets acquired related to software (US$0.6 million) mainly relate to the improvements and updates to Pharming's ERP system SAP S/4HANA. The ERP system was implemented and operational as of January 1  2022 and amortized over five years  which is considered to be the expected economic lifetime.Property  plant and equipmentProperty  plant and equipment decreased from US$13.2 million for 2021 to US$10.4 million for 2022. The decrease was mainly caused by regular depreciation (US$2.6 million)  foreign currency effects US$0.7 million and impairments and divestment activities (US$0.9 million). These activities were related to assets designated to the development of rhC1INH therapy for Acute Kidney Injury  which was stopped.The decrease was partly offset by capital expenditures of US$1.4 million mainly relating to new machinery and equipment for Pharming's production process.Right-of-use assetsThe right-of-use assets increased by US$8.9 million to US$28.8 million for 2022 (2021: US$19.9 million). Investments of US$16.8 million in 2022  were primarily related to a new asset caused by the inception of the lease contract for the DSP facility at Pivot Park  Oss. As communicated in the prior year  as a result of our renewed strategic manufacturing partnership with long-term manufacturing partner Sanofi S.A.  Pharming decided to complete the construction of the new building  but will no longer pursue the realization of its own downstream production capacity at Pivot Park in Oss. During 2022 the lease commenced and resulted in an investment of US$14.6 million. Pharming is currently looking into possibilities for alternative use. As a result of aforementioned decision  the right-of-use asset was impaired for an amount of US$3.9 million. The remainder of the investments relate to investments in Pharming's lease car portfolio.The increase in the right-to-use assets are partly offset by regular depreciation (US$3.0 million) and foreign currency effects (US$0.8 million).InvestmentsInvestments increased by US$1.1 million to US$9.7 million at December 31  2022. This was caused by a decrease in investments accounted for using the equity method of US$4.7 million in 2022 from US$7.2 million at the end of the year in 2021  which resulted in a balance of US$2.5 million for the year ended December 31  2022. Next to this  a decrease was applicable in investments in debt instruments designated as at the Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income (FVTOCI) of US$1.0 million to US$0.4 million for the year ended December 31  2022 (2021: US$1.4 million). Finally  Pharming recognized a new investment in a debt instrument designated as at FVTPL (US$6.8 million).Investments accounted for using the equity methodThe asset relates to an investment in the ordinary shares of BioConnection Investments B.V.. During the second quarter of 2022  Pharming entered into a share purchase agreement  following receipt of an offer for all shares in BioConnection by Gimv  a European investment company listed on Euronext Brussels. The existing shareholders (including Pharming) reached an agreement with Gimv on the sale of all issued and outstanding shares to a new holding company (BioConnection Investments B.V.) incorporated by Gimv  followed by a partial re-investment by existing shareholders of the purchase price in the share capital of BioConnection Investments B.V. The re-investment relates to the purchase of ordinary shares and a preference share. The transaction diluted Pharming's stake in BioConnection from 43.85% in 2021 to 22.98% in 2022  which caused a decrease of US$3.0 millionAs a result of this transaction  Pharming received one-off net cash proceeds of US$7.5 million (EUR6.9 million) and recognized a gain of US$12.2 million.Furthermore  the remainder of the decrease was caused by the recognition of Pharming's share in the results of BioConnection and currency translation effects.Investment in debt instruments designated as at FVTPLThe asset relates to the preference share as obtained as part of the agreement referred to above relating to BioConnection Investments B.V. The fair value was calculated based on a commonly accepted valuation method  the option pricing model (""OPM""). As a result  Pharming recognized a fair value asset of US$7.9 million at inception date in Q2 2022. Management reassessed the fair value at December 31  2022  resulting in a decrease of the fair value of US$1.2 million.InventoriesInventories increased from US$27.3 million for the year ended December 31  2021 to US$42.3 million for the year ended December 31  2022. This was largely due to an increase in work in progress inventory.Cash and cash equivalentsCash and cash equivalents  together with restricted cash  increased to US$208.7 million at the year-end 2022  compared with US$193.0 million for the year ended December 31  2021. This was a result of positive cash flows from operating activities of US$22.9 million and positive cash flows generated from investing activities of US$5.3 million. This was offset by net cash flows used in financing activities of US$5.0 million and currency translation effect of US$7.8 million.EquityThe equity position increased by US$11.7 million from US$192.9 million for the year ended December 31  2021 to US$204.6 million for the year ended December 31  2022. This was mainly due to the changes in the net result achieved by Pharming (US$13.7 million) and transactions recognized directly in equity relating to share based compensation and exercised options (US$8.7 million)  and was partly offset by other comprehensive income relating to the currency translation reserve of US$10.4 million and fair value changes on investments designated as fair value with changes through other comprehensive income (US$0.7 million).Convertible bondThe convertible bond has decreased by US$7.5 million to US$133.4 million at year-end 2022  moving from US$140.9 million as of December 31  2021. This was mainly caused by foreign currency effects of US$8.3 million  which was partly offset by amortization of transactions costs (US$0.8 million). During 2022  a total of US$4.0 million of interest was paid on the bond.Lease liabilitiesLease liabilities increased by US$12.4 million from US$20.9 million as of 2021 to US$33.3 million per December 31  2022. The increase (US$16.2 million) was mainly due to new lease contracts for our DSP facility at Pivot Park  Oss in the Netherlands  inflation increases on lease prices for other facilities  and additions to the liability due to expansion of Pharming's car fleet. This was partly offset by monthly or quarterly lease payments (US$3.3 million). The remainder relates to regularly accrued interest expenses and foreign exchange effects.Outlook/SummaryFor 2023  the Company anticipates:Continued low single digit growth in annual revenues from RUCONEST¬Æ  with quarterly fluctuations expected.Subject to FDA approval in the U.S. for leniolisib  we plan to commercially launch leniolisib in 2Q 2023.We anticipate a positive CHMP opinion for leniolisib in 2H 2023. Marketing authorisation in Europe expected ‚àº2 months later  followed by commercial launches in individual EU countries.Following an anticipated positive CHMP opinion in 2H 2023  we intend to submit an ECDRP filing with the UK MHRA for leniolisib shortly thereafter. Approval expected several months later.Pharming will continue to allocate resources to accelerate future growth. Investments in launch preparations  commercialization  and focused clinical developments for leniolisib  including to support pediatric and Japan approvals and for the development of leniolisib in additional indications  will continue to impact profit throughout 2023.

Additional information on palovarotene clinical trial data  requested in a complete response letter to Ipsen in December 2022  will be reviewed as part of this resubmission process.If approved  palovarotene  which has received FDA Breakthrough Therapy and Orphan Drug designations  would be the first treatment for an estimated 400 people in the U.S. living with FOP  an ultra-rare  progressive  life-limiting bone disease.1 2Data submitted to the FDA include additional analyses from across the palovarotene clinical trial program  including the pivotal MOVE study 3 the first Phase III study carried out in people with FOP.Furthermore  Ipsen has requested a re-examination of the European Medicines Agency‚Äôs January 2023 Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) opinion on palovarotene.Palovarotene is authorized for use in appropriate patients in Canada where it is marketed as SohonosTM (palovarotene capsules). It also has conditional approval in United Arab Emirates. Investigational palovarotene is under review with several regulatory authorities.ENDSAbout FOPFOP impacts the lives of an estimated 900 people globally.1 2 The disease continuously progresses with flare-up episodes causing rapid bone growth. Most people living with FOP inevitably lose the ability to eat and drink on their own  cannot provide self-care or use the restroom themselves  and are unable to maintain employment.4 By the age of 30 years old  the majority of people with FOP require a wheelchair and full-time caregiver assistance.1 Without disease-modifying treatments  current management is limited to palliative care and ultimately FOP shortens the median life expectancy to 56 years  as untimely death is caused by bone formation around the ribcage leading to breathing problems and cardiorespiratory failure.4About the MOVE trialMOVE (NCT03312634) is a Phase III  multicenter  single-arm  open-label trial to assess the efficacy and safety of palovarotene. 107 study participants with FOP received oral palovarotene as a chronic (5mg once daily) and episodic (20mg once daily for 4 weeks  followed by 10mg for ‚â•8 weeks for flare-ups and trauma) regimen. The primary endpoint was annualized change in new HO (Heterotopic Ossification) volume measured by low-dose whole-body computed tomography. Efficacy data from participants enrolled in MOVE were compared with data from FOP Natural History Study (NHS) participants  untreated beyond standard of care. Individuals ‚â§65 years of age with clinically diagnosed FOP and a verified ACVR1R206H pathogenic variant were eligible for inclusion in the NHS.Results from the post-hoc interim three analysis demonstrated a clinically meaningful 60 percent reduction in new abnormal bone formation HO volume in participants treated with palovarotene  compared to patients on standard of care. Palovarotene also demonstrated a well-characterized safety profile consistent with other therapies in the systemic retinoids class.3These data were published in the Journal of Bone and Mineral Research in December 2022.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen‚Äôs future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‚Äòbelieves‚Äô  ‚Äòanticipates‚Äô and ‚Äòexpects‚Äô and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen‚Äôs expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen‚Äôs patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen‚Äôs activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen‚Äôs partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen‚Äôs business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law.

SNL is a company incorporated in Bermuda with Norway as its home state in the European Economic Area. The Companies Act 1981 of Bermuda (the 'Bermuda Companies Act') governs the incorporation  organisation and executive management of SNL. As a company listed on Oslo B√∏rs  SNL is also subject to certain obligations set out in Euronext Rule Book I and Oslo B√∏rs Rulebook II and  in addition  certain provisions of the Norwegian Securities Trading Act and other relevant Norwegian rules and regulations  including certain provisions of the Norwegian Securities Trading Regulations. According to the Oslo B√∏rs Rulebook II  the Norwegian Code of Practice for Corporate Governance (the 'Norwegian Code of Practice') also applies to the Company as no such code has been implemented in Bermuda. Adherence to the Norwegian Code of Practice is based on a 'comply or explain' principle  whereby companies are expected to either comply with its principles and recommendations  or explain the deviation and what alternative solutions it has selected. Pursuant to the Norwegian Accounting Act and the Oslo B√∏rs Rulebook II  the Company has summarised any expansions or deviations in the SNL Bye-Laws from the provisions of Chapter 5 of the Norwegian Public Limited Liability Companies Act (dealing with General Meetings of Shareholders). This summary  together with the Company's Bye-Laws  are available at www.stolt-nielsen. com/investors/governance/. The Norwegian Code of Practice is available at www.nues.no/English 1. Implementation and Reporting on Corporate Governance SNL has a Code of Business Conduct which applies to all directors  officers  employees  contractors and consultants of the Group. The Code of Business Conduct is reviewed annually by the Audit Committee and approved by the Board of Directors. The Company's overarching business conduct guidelines  including ethical and social responsibility guidance  are set out in its Code of Business Conduct and  where appropriate  more specific policies have been developed to provide more detailed guidance. The reasons for the deviations from the principles and recommendations of the Norwegian Code of Practice and the solutions the Company has selected are explained throughout this Corporate Governance Report. 2. Business In compliance with the Bermuda Companies Act and common practice for Bermuda companies  SNL's Memorandum of Association describes its objectives and purposes as 'unrestricted'. The Board of Directors sets  evaluates  and regularly reviews the Group's objectives  overall strategy and principal risks  taking into account sustainability  including how matters relating to the environment  social issues  the working environment  equality and non-discrimination are integrated into the value creation. This is further described in the Business Review and Sustainability sections of this Annual Report. Deviation from the Norwegian Code of Practice: the Company's objects are unrestricted under the SNL Bye-Laws  which is customary for a Bermuda company  but publicly disclosed in a manner that enables SNL's shareholders to anticipate its activities. 3. Equity and Dividends The Board of Directors is of the opinion that the Company currently has a suitable capital structure to meet its objectives  strategy and risk profile. The authorised share capital of SNL is $65 016 250  divided into 65 000 000 Common Shares  each with a par value of $1.00  and 16 250 000 Founder's Shares  each with a par value of $0.001. As of November 30  2022  58 523 796 Common Shares and 14 630 949 Founder's Shares were issued  and 53 523 796 Common Shares and 13 380 949 Founder's Shares were outstanding. In accordance with provisions of the SNL Bye-Laws  the authorised share capital of SNL may only be increased  reduced or otherwise altered by resolution of the shareholders. The Board of Directors  subject to any shareholder resolution to the contrary  has the power to issue any unissued shares of the Company within the limits of the authorised capital. In accordance with the provisions of the SNL Bye-Laws and the Bermuda Companies Act  the Company may purchase its own shares for cancellation or acquire such shares as treasury shares on such terms as the Board of Directors shall think fit. Historically  the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders of SNL has authorised the Company  or any wholly-owned subsidiary  to purchase Common Shares of the Company from time to time in the open market  subject to certain conditions and in conformity with applicable laws and standards. The Board of Directors has resolved to continue share purchases  if any  on the terms approved at the Annual General Meeting. 42 Stolt-Nielsen Limited | Annual Report 2022 Directors' Report The Board of Directors has established a dividend policy that is available on the SNL website: www.stolt-nielsen.com/investors/ dividends/. Under Bermuda law  a company's board of directors may not declare or pay dividends if there are reasonable grounds for believing that the company is  or would after the payment  be unable to pay its liabilities as they become due or that the realisable value of its assets would thereby be less than its liabilities. Deviation from the Norwegian Code of Practice: none 4. Equal Treatment of Shareholders SNL has two classes of shares  Common Shares and Founder's Shares  which carry rights as set forth in the SNL Bye-Laws. Subject to such rights  the Company treats shareholders within each class equally  in accordance with the Norwegian Code of Practice and the Norwegian Securities Trading Act. Only the Common Shares are listed on Oslo B√∏rs. You can find the list of our major shareholders at www.stolt-nielsen.com/investors/shareholder-information/ and the SNL Bye-Laws at www.stolt-nielsen.com/investors/governance/ Any transactions SNL carries out in its own shares are carried out either through Oslo B√∏rs or at prevailing stock exchange prices if carried out in any other way. Deviation from the Norwegian Code of Practice: none. 5. Shares and Negotiability Only the SNL Common Shares are listed on Oslo B√∏rs. The SNL Bye-Laws limit individual shareholdings of the Company's shares to 20% of the issued and outstanding shares (unless such ownership shall have been approved in advance by the Board of Directors)  single US person shareholdings to 9.9% and shareholders of any single country in aggregate to 49.9%. However  these restrictions do not apply to any person who was a shareholder of Stolt-Nielsen S.A. (which amalgamated with the Company on November 18  2010) as of August 31  1987 or any Affiliate or Associate (as such terms are defined in the SNL Bye-Laws) of such person  except in certain circumstances as outlined in Bye-Law 74 of the SNL Bye-Laws  which are available at: www.stolt-nielsen.com/investors/governance/ According to the SNL Bye-Laws  the Board of Directors is authorised to further restrict  reduce or prevent the ownership of shares if it appears to the Board of Directors that such ownership may threaten SNL with adverse consequences  including but not limited to adverse tax consequences  hostile takeover attempts or adverse governmental sanctions. The Board of Directors has to date not made use of its authority and will not use its authority unless the transfer will have sufficient adverse consequences for the Company and in no event if the exercise of such rights may cause disturbances in the market or would be in conflict with mandatory laws or regulations. Please also refer to Section 14. below for an explanation of the Board's approach to takeovers. Deviation from the Norwegian Code of Practice: a summary of provisions of Chapter 5 of the Norwegian Public Limited Liability Companies Act where the SNL Bye-Laws expand or deviate from the provisions of such Act can also be found on the Company's website at www.stolt-nielsen.com/investors/governance/ 6. General Meetings The Board of Directors or the Chairman are responsible for calling both Annual and Special General Meetings of Shareholders. At any General Meeting  two or more persons present in person throughout the meeting and representing in person or by proxy issued voting shares in the Company shall form a quorum for the transaction of business  except for those matters under the Bermuda Companies Act for which a specified super majority vote is required  in which case a quorum representing one-third of the issued and outstanding shares entitled to vote is required. The Company is obligated to hold an Annual General Meeting every year at such time and place as the Board of Directors or Chairman shall designate. A shareholder or group of shareholders representing at least one-tenth of the outstanding voting shares may request a Special General Meeting in writing indicating the agenda thereof. The Board of Directors will be obligated to convene the meeting forthwith. Notices for both Annual and Special General Meetings shall be sent by mail (or by such other method pursuant to the SNL Bye-Laws) to all holders entitled to attend and vote no later than 21 days before the date set for the General Meeting. Notices shall provide sufficiently detailed  comprehensive  and specific information on all matters to be considered at the General Meeting  voting instructions and the opportunity to vote by proxy. Matters at the General Meetings are restricted to those set forth in the agenda. Stolt-Nielsen Limited | Annual Report 2022 43 Corporate Governance continued The foregoing provisions relating to the holding of  and conduct at  General Meetings are set forth in the SNL Bye-Laws  as well as in relevant provisions of the Bermuda Companies Act. SNL is under the majority control of Fiducia Ltd  a company owned by a trust established for the benefit of the Stolt-Nielsen family. As of November 30  2022  Fiducia Ltd. controls 64.8% of the outstanding shares of SNL entitled to vote generally on matters brought to a vote of the shareholders of SNL. When the shares held by trusts established for the benefit of members of the Stolt-Nielsen family together with shares held by individual members of the Stolt-Nielsen family are taken into account  the combined shareholdings total 66.3% of the outstanding shares of SNL entitled to vote generally on matters brought to a vote of the shareholders of SNL. Deviation from the Norwegian Code of Practice: General Meetings are typically held by shareholders granting proxies  with voting instructions being given to such proxies ahead of the General Meeting. As such  the Chairman or the full Board of Directors may  but do not always  attend General Meetings. 7. Nomination Committee Neither Bermuda law nor the SNL Bye-Laws require that a nomination committee be established. Consequently  SNL has not established a nomination committee. Members of the Board of Directors identify and evaluate proposed candidates for nomination to the Board of Directors based on merit. Individuals are selected for nomination to the Board of Directors because of their business or professional experience  and their array of talents and perspectives  to promote a culture that generates the diversity of thought  approach and ideas needed to further the Company's strategic objectives. The Board of Directors regularly reviews its composition  to ensure that it can attend to the common interests of all shareholders and meet the Company's need for expertise  capability  diversity and independence. The Board of Directors also monitors that its members have sufficient capacity to carry out their duties. Directors' external commitments are described earlier in this Corporate Governance Report. Deviation from the Norwegian Code of Practice: the Company does not have a Nomination Committee  but the Board of Directors has put processes in place to review its performance and composition on an ongoing basis  as described above. 8. Board of Directors: Composition and Independence The business affairs of SNL are managed under the direction of the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors may delegate authority to the Chairman  specified committees of the Board of Directors  or to SNL's executive management. SNL does not have a corporate assembly as this is not required under Bermuda law. As provided in the SNL Bye-Laws  the Board of Directors shall be composed of at least three and not more than nine Directors. The Board of Directors believes that the optimal size for the Board of Directors should be six to eight Directors. The Board of Directors' size is flexible depending on the circumstances and the qualifications of proposed candidates. Directors are elected at the Annual General Meeting. Directors shall hold office for such term as decided by the General Meeting  or in absence of such determination  until the next Annual General Meeting or until their successors are elected or appointed or their office is otherwise vacated. Directors may be removed only for cause by a vote at a Special General Meeting held for that purpose. In the event of a vacancy on the Board of Directors  the remaining members of the Board of Directors may fill such vacancy and appoint a member to act until the next General Meeting at which the Directors are re-elected. The foregoing provisions relating to the election  removal and replacement of Directors are set forth in the SNL Bye-Laws. Four of the current seven SNL Directors  Samuel Cooperman  Janet Ashdown  Rolf Habben Jansen and Tor Olav Tr√∏im  are considered to be independent from the Company's major shareholders  the executive management  and the Company's main business associates according to the Norwegian Code of Practice. In the view of the Board of Directors  the composition of the Board of Directors and Board Committees ensures continuity and experience and is suitable to represent the interests of the minority shareholders. The Chairman of the Board of Directors is elected by the Annual General Meeting. The Chief Executive Officer is a member of the Board of Directors. Information on the members of the Board of Directors can be found earlier in this Corporate Governance Report  and an up-to-date composition of the Board of Directors is maintained and available on the Company's website at: www.stolt-nielsen.com/about-us/leadership-team/ Deviation from the Norwegian Code of Practice: as permitted under Bermuda law and customary for Bermuda companies  the Company's Chief Executive Officer has been elected to the Board of Directors by the Annual General Meeting. Bermuda law further permits non-independent board members to be nominated for election as board chair. 44 Stolt-Nielsen Limited | Annual Report 2022 Directors' Report 9. The Work of the Board of Directors Board Meetings The Board of Directors  acting as a collegiate body  has the ultimate responsibility for the management of the Company. The Board of Directors holds at least four regularly scheduled meetings a year  as well as ad-hoc meetings when required. Meeting schedules are approved annually by all members of the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors may appoint a Board Secretary who does not need to be a member of the Board of Directors. Decisions of the Board of Directors shall be taken by a majority of the votes cast by the Directors present and represented at such meeting provided a quorum is present. A majority of the Directors then in office shall constitute a quorum. The Board of Directors may also act by unanimous written consent. The Audit Committee has established processes to monitor all transactions which may give rise to conflict or potential conflict of interest. Members of the Board of Directors and executive management must notify the Audit Committee and Board of Directors if they have any material direct or indirect interest in any proposed transaction to be entered into by SNL. Following such notification  and unless disqualified by the chair of the relevant Audit Committee or Board of Directors meeting  a Director may vote in respect of any such matter and may be counted in the quorum for such meeting. Board Meetings - Executive Sessions Executive management is available to discuss matters of concern to the Board of Directors  and the Board of Directors has regular access to executive management. The basic duties and responsibilities of the Directors include attending Board of Directors' meetings  preparing for meetings by advance review of any meeting materials and actively participating in the Board of Directors' discussions. Directors are also expected to make themselves available outside scheduled meetings for advice and consultation. The Board of Directors ensures that SNL has effective internal controls in accordance with the regulations that apply to its activities  including SNL's corporate values and ethical guidelines. Board Committees The Board of Directors has established an Audit Committee and a Compensation Committee. The Board of Directors periodically reviews the size  structure and function of the Board Committees. The Audit Committee and Compensation Committee have written terms of reference  which are reviewed and reassessed by the relevant Committee and approved by the Board of Directors on an annual basis. The Audit Committee is composed of at least two members  a majority of whom should normally qualify as independent pursuant to all applicable regulatory requirements. The Audit Committee has overall responsibility for overseeing the accounting and financial reporting processes of the Company  the audits of the Company's financial statements  and the work of the Company's external auditor and Internal Audit department. The Audit Committee also recommends the external auditor's appointment  compensation and retention. Under Bermuda law the appointment of the external auditor has to be made by shareholders in General Meeting  but the approval of the external auditor's compensation may be delegated by the shareholders to the Board of Directors. The Compensation Committee is composed of at least two members  at least one of whom should normally qualify as independent pursuant to all applicable regulatory requirements. The Compensation Committee is responsible for compensation strategy  overall salary reviews and awards under its compensation programmes. It reviews and approves all aspects of senior executive management compensation  including performance incentive and equity-based compensation plans. Each Committee has a Chair who reports on the activities of such Committee at each meeting of the full Board of Directors. The members of the Committees are set out earlier in this Corporate Governance Report  and an up-to-date list is also maintained on the Company's website at: www.stolt-nielsen.com/about-us/leadership-team/ Agreements with Related Parties The Board of Directors reviews  at least annually  the financial and other relationships between each Director and SNL. Through the Audit Committee  the Board of Directors has adopted guidelines and procedures to ensure that  should any transaction involving related parties be considered  such transaction be appropriately reviewed for potential conflict of interest situations  with the aim of preventing value from being transferred to related parties. Any such transactions would require approval from the Audit Committee or Board of Directors and be disclosed in the Notes to the Financial Statements of this Annual Report. Deviation from the Norwegian Code of Practice: none. Stolt-Nielsen Limited | Annual Report 2022 45 Corporate Governance continued 10. Risk Management and Internal Control The Board of Directors is ultimately responsible for SNL's system of internal control  which covers financial  operational and compliance controls as well as risk management processes. SNL's system of internal control is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and provide reasonable assurance that SNL is operating legally  ethically and within approved financial and operational policies and procedures with sufficient safeguards against material financial statement misstatements or loss of assets. The main elements of the Company's system of internal control over financial reporting include the Code of Business Conduct and other corporate governance and compliance policies  global accounting policies and procedures  financial reporting risk assessments  annual budgets  authorisation limits  periodic reporting and evaluation of budgeted versus actual results. The different layers of control allow for a greater probability that errors in the financial reporting are identified early and corrected. SNL's business heads conduct an annual review of SNL's most significant areas of exposure to risk  which are detailed in the Directors' Report of this Annual Report. The Internal Audit department provides assurance that the Company has appropriate internal control  risk management and related corporate governance systems in place throughout the organisation  performs regular independent audit reviews of these systems to assure adherence and recommend improvements  and reports to the Audit Committee accordingly. The Board of Directors  through the Audit Committee  oversees the monitoring of compliance with the system of internal control over financial reporting. At its quarterly meeting the Audit Committee reviews and discusses results of internal audits performed by the Internal Audit department. This also includes matters of an ethical nature. All employees  customers  suppliers and other parties have direct access to the Audit Committee  through the Company's whistleblowing system  to report any potential illegal or unethical matters. This confidential system can be accessed on the Company's website at: https://report.whistleb.com/en/stolt-nielsen Deviation from the Norwegian Code of Practice: none. 11. Remuneration of the Board of Directors The Board of Directors reviews the Directors' compensation periodically. The review includes a comparison of the Company's compensation practices against the practices of comparable US and European companies. The remuneration of the Board of Directors reflects its responsibility  expertise  time commitment and the complexity of SNL's activities. The remuneration is not linked to the performance of the Company. Members of the Board of Directors and/or companies with which they are associated shall not in principle take on specific assignments for SNL in addition to their appointment as a member of the Board of Directors. If they do nonetheless take on such assignments this shall be disclosed to and receive prior approval from the full Board of Directors. The remuneration for such additional duties shall be approved by the Board of Directors. The remuneration awarded to the Board of Directors for their service as Directors is disclosed in aggregate in this Annual Report. Any remuneration in addition to normal directors' fees is specifically identified. Deviations from the Norwegian Code of Practice: none. 12. Salary and Other Remuneration for Executive Management The Compensation Committee of SNL is responsible for compensation strategy  overall salary reviews and awards under its compensation programmes. It reviews and approves all aspects of executive management compensation  including performance incentive compensation plans to ensure that such plans are linked to long-term value creation for the shareholders or the Company's earnings performance over time. The Company has in place an annual and a long-term incentive plan aimed at tying executive management's compensation with the performance of the Company. All performance related compensation is capped at a maximum percent of the salary of the executive management. Deviation from the Norwegian Code of Practice: Bermuda law does not require guidelines for the remuneration of executive personnel to be communicated to the Annual General Meeting  but the Compensation Committee carefully evaluates executive management's salary and other remuneration based on the key principles described above. 46 Stolt-Nielsen Limited | Annual Report 2022 Attachments Original LinkOriginal DocumentPermalink Disclaimer Stolt-Nielsen Ltd. published this content on 15 March 2023 and is solely responsible for the information contained therein.

The company also will establish a $35 cap on out-of-pocket costs for Lantus for all patients with commercial insurance  underscoring its longstanding commitment to offer affordable access to medicines.These moves  which go into effect January 1  2024  will come in addition to decisions taken in June 2022 to lower diabetes medicines costs: the launch of an unbranded Lantus biologic at -60% versus Lantus list price  and a cap on out-of-pocket costs on insulin to $35 for all people without insurance. With all those decisions  now Sanofi‚Äôs suite of savings programs ensures that no patient will pay more than $35 for a monthly supply of Lantus. Finally  Sanofi will also cut the list price of its short-acting Apidra (insulin glulisine injection) 100 Units/mL by 70%.Olivier BogillotHead  U.S. General Medicines  Sanofi‚ÄúSanofi believes that no one should struggle to pay for their insulin and we are proud of our continued actions to improve access and affordability for millions of patients for many years. We launched our unbranded biologic for Lantus at 60 percent less than the Lantus list price in June 2022 but  despite this pioneering low-price approach  the health system was unable to take advantage of it due to its inherent structural challenges. We are pleased to see others join our efforts to help patients as we now accelerate the transformation of the U.S. insulin market. Our decision to cut the list price of our lead insulin needs to be coupled with broader change to the overall system to actually drive savings for patients at the pharmacy counter.‚ÄùSanofi Savings ProgramsSanofi will continue to provide different programs to ensure access and affordability to patients depending on their coverage situations and will continue to monitor policy and market changes. Our suite of innovative programs includes:100% of commercially insured people are eligible for Sanofi‚Äôs copay assistance programs  regardless of income or insurance plan design  which  in 2022 limited out-of-pocket expenses for a majority of participating patients to $15 or less for their diabetes medicines for a 30-day supply.people are eligible for Sanofi‚Äôs copay assistance programs  regardless of income or insurance plan design  which  in 2022 limited out-of-pocket expenses for a majority of participating patients to $15 or less for their diabetes medicines for a 30-day supply. 100% of uninsured people are eligible for the Insulins Valyou Savings Program ‚Äì regardless of income level ‚Äì enabling them to buy one or multiple Sanofi insulins at $35 for a 30-day supply.

In many cases we have been informed by the end users that they hold warrants alongside DCAC Ordinary Shares. Once again  due to complexities resulting from incorrect tendering  it is necessary to make further enquiries to determine DCAC Public Warrant holdings.The total number of DCAC Ordinary Shares that could be tendered under the Stub Tender Offer was 325 000. In accordance with the Repurchase Tender Document and the Stub Tender Offer Circular each dated 25 January 2023  if tenders of more than 325 000 DCAC Ordinary Shares are received under the Stub Tender Offer  then the DCAC Sponsor and/or its assigns will offer to purchase such DCAC Ordinary Shares on the same or similar terms as those set out in this Circular.On receipt of valid tenders pursuant to the Stub Tender Offer in excess of 325 000 DCAC Ordinary Shares  DCAC shall  in its absolute discretion  determine the number of DCAC Ordinary Shares and accompanying DCAC Public Warrants that shall be acquired.Accordingly  the DCAC Sponsor anticipates it will purchase 418 DCAC Ordinary Shares. A price of up to ¬£2.20 per DCAC Ordinary Share and up to ¬£0.066 per DCAC Public Warrant will be paid  subject in each case to and provided that  such combined total amount payable under the Stub Tender Offer shall not exceed the equivalent of ¬£0.130 per DCAC Ordinary Share based on 100% of the tendering DCAC Ordinary Shareholders' original shareholding of DCAC Ordinary Shares at the Record Date. The Final settlement Date of the Stub Tender Offer is 20 March 2023 and valid Stub Tenders will be settled on that date  however  there may be a delay to the Final settlement Date where the DCAC Board considers that further enquiry is needed.Copies of the Stub Tender Offer Circular are available on DCAC's website: www.disruptivecapitalac.com .The repurchased DCAC Ordinary Shares will be held as treasury shares by he Company  pending prospective sale and transfer under the potential Business Combination with Global Inter Connection Group SA.

The figure for EBITDA in FY 2022 highlights was inaccurately cited. The correct amount is USD 1 743 million. The complete and corrected release follows: Amsterdam  16 March 2022 07:00 CET: VEON Ltd. (NASDAQ: VEON  Euronext Amsterdam: VEON)  a global digital operator that provides converged connectivity and online services  announces selected financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and full year ended 31 December 2022  excluding the results of the Russian operations  as they were classified as ‚Äòheld for sale‚Äô and ‚Äòdiscontinued operations‚Äô in 4Q22: In Q4 2022  VEON‚Äôs local currency performance accelerated sharply with total revenues of USD 940 million  -4.9% YoY in reported currency (+18.6% YoY in local currency)  service revenues were USD 901 million  -4.4% YoY in reported currency (+19.2% in local currency)  and EBITDA was USD 453 million  +1.2% YoY in reported currency (+30.1% YoY in local currency). For FY 2022  VEON‚Äôs total revenues amounted to USD 3 755 million  -2.4% YoY in reported currency (+14.0% YoY local currency)  service revenues were USD 3 600 million  -2.4% YoY in reported currency (+13.9% YoY in local currency)  and EBITDA was USD 1 743 million  -5.3% YoY in reported currency (+12.6% YoY local currency). Full-year capex of USD 832 million was 2.9% higher than in 2021  with capex intensity up 1.1 p.p. as the company invested in 4G network expansion. Total cash and cash equivalents were USD 3.1 billion  with USD 2.5 billion held at the HQ level. Commenting on the results  Kaan Terzioƒülu said: ‚ÄúIn the final quarter of 2022  we added further operational momentum and recorded double-digit local currency revenue growth in five of our countries  doubling the growth rate from a year ago. With our Russian operations now classified as ‚Äòheld for sale‚Äô and ‚Äòdiscontinued operations‚Äô and not contributing to Group revenues  VEON‚Äôs topline growth in local currency for the full year 2022 was 14.0%. Furthermore  the sale of Russia will result in the significant deleveraging of the Group balance sheet. While we are smaller in size  we are now a faster growing company  serving emerging markets with strong potential demand for the services that VEON‚Äôs Digital Operator 1440 model offers. In 2022  each of our operations achieved significant growth  both in terms of financial performance and the operational metrics that underpin our business. Our local operating companies collectively added 14 million 4G customers  bringing 4G-powered digital ‚Äòmultiplay‚Äô users to 22% of our subscriber base while growing ARPU and customer engagement by providing more relevant connected services for our core telecom users. This strong operational performance has continued and YTD February 2023 local currency revenues are up by 15.2% YoY and local currency EBITDA up by 11.8% YoY. With continued focus on operational performance as well as financial discipline and liquidity management  including our strong liquidity position at year-end  we are well positioned to deliver growth while significantly deleveraging VEON‚Äôs balance sheet and enhancing VEON‚Äôs credit profile in 2023.‚Äù Q4 2022 highlights Revenue of USD 940 million  -4.9% YoY (+18.6% YoY in local currency)Service revenue of USD 901 million  -4.4% YoY (+19.2% YoY in local currency)Data and digital revenues of USD 474 million  -7.5% YoY (+15.8% YoY in local currency)EBITDA of USD 453 million  +1.2% YoY (+30.1% YoY in local currency)Capex of USD 263 million  -5.1% YoY  with capex intensity of 22.1%Total cash and cash equivalents of USD 3.1 billion  +37.9% YoY  with USD 2.5 billion at Headquarters157 million mobile subscribers  up 2.7% YoY85 million 4G users  up 19.4% YoY  with 53.9% penetration of customer base FY 2022 highlights Revenue of USD 3 755 million  -2.4% YoY (+14.0% YoY in local currency)Service revenue of USD 3 600 million  -2.4% YoY (+13.9% YoY in local currency)Data and digital revenues of USD 1 937 million  -0.7% YoY (+16.5% YoY in local currency)EBITDA of USD 1 743 million  -5.3% YoY (+12.6% YoY in local currency)Capex of USD 832 million  +2.9% YoY  with capex intensity of 22.1%Total cash and cash equivalents of USD 3.1 billion  +37.9% YoY  with USD 2.5 billion at Headquarters157 million mobile subscribers  up 2.7% YoY85 million 4G users  up 19.4% YoY  with 53.9% penetration of customer base In 4Q22  VEON accelerated local currency revenue & EBITDA growth and continued to gain market share in each of its markets. The Group maintained strong liquidity  with Group cash and cash equivalents of USD 3.1 billion as of 31 December 2022. Total Group revenues decreased by 4.9% YoY during 4Q22 in reported currency and increased by 18.6% in local currency terms  with Ukraine revenues growing 8.7% YoY in local currency and all other countries reporting double-digit local currency revenue growth for the period. Service revenues decreased by 4.4% YoY in reported currency and rose by 19.2% YoY in local currency. In 4Q22  Group EBITDA increased by 1.2% YoY in reported currency terms (+30.1% in local currency)  with Group EBITDA margin of 48.2% (+2.9 p.p. YoY). Energy costs increased across the Group +c.30% YoY negatively impacting Group EBITDA margin. We remain focused on implementing planned cost-efficiency measures across the Group and on applying inflationary pricing across our operations. Project Optimum delivered c.USD 95 million of savings in 2022 with cost intensity improving by 2.5 p.p. YoY in local currency. The Group‚Äôs YoY revenues and EBITDA performance was impacted by several extraordinary non-recurring items in 4Q22 and in 4Q21  as noted in the Country Performance section. Excluding these one-off items  Group total revenue increased by 15.4% YoY  service revenue increased by 15.8% YoY and EBITDA increased by 7.4% YoY in local currency. In 4Q22  we reported subscriber base growth of 2.7% YoY. The Group continued to focus on overall customer experience  seeing improving Net Promoter Score (‚ÄúNPS‚Äù) across most of the countries. This supported a 19.4% YoY increase in 4G users  which reached 84.6 million  with 13.8 million users added during the year. As of 31 December 2022  4G subscribers accounted for 53.9% of our total subscriber base  up 7.5 p.p. from a year earlier supporting the execution of VEON‚Äôs Digital Operator strategy. Each of our operations have increased their ARPU levels YoY as they delivered a broader range of services to their customers  achieving greater wallet shares while also implementing inflationary pricing. Our operating companies continued to execute VEON‚Äôs Digital Operator strategy (‚ÄúDO1440‚Äù)  aiming to deliver digital experiences for every minute of the day powered by high-quality mobile internet connectivity. On the back of our growing 4G penetration and with increasing usage of our digital services  we have expanded our multiplay customer base by 40.3% YoY  with 28.4 million multiplay customers at the end of December. While representing just 22% of the user base  multiplay customers were the source of 38.6% of VEON‚Äôs B2C revenues. Multiplay customer ARPU is 3.6 times higher  and churn is 0.4 times lower than for single play voice-only customers. Media streaming services Toffee in Bangladesh and Tamasha in Pakistan were among key drivers of growth in multiplay  as well as our overall digital offering. Toffee in Bangladesh reached 21.2 million monthly active users (‚ÄúMAUs‚Äù) in December 2022  a 3.3-fold YoY increase  with 5.2 million average daily users (5.0 times higher YoY). Tamasha in Pakistan reached 4.3 million MAUs  a 3.5-fold YoY increase. Our digital financial services business in Pakistan  JazzCash  increased its monthly active users by 8.0% YoY  reaching 16.4 million MAUs and increasing its 12-month total transaction volume by 31.3% YoY. In 4Q22  Group capex was USD 263 million  driven by investment in 4G networks in Ukraine  Bangladesh and Uzbekistan  in line with our growth strategy. At 22.1%  capex intensity increased marginally by 1.1 p.p. YoY  primarily due to adverse FX rate movements. We closed the fourth quarter with total cash of USD 3.1 billion  including USD 2.5 billion at the HQ level. Our operations remain largely self-funding. In Ukraine  the team continued to work to keep the country connected  with around 90% of our radio network operational at the end of the quarter. However  over the course of the quarter  damage to Ukrainian power infrastructure impacted network availability at times. Kyivstar‚Äôs revenues were up 8.7% YoY in local currency (-20.7% YoY in reported currency); the Ukrainian hryvnia‚Äôs forex performance negatively impacted reported currency growth rates. Kyivstar‚Äôs 4G customer base grew 8.2% YoY  and our customers consumed more data  with data usage rising 26.3% YoY. EBITDA decreased by 7.3% YoY in local currency (-32.4% YoY in reported currency) in 4Q22. EBITDA performance was impacted by the change in revenue mix impacting margins  operational cost pressures including energy costs  indexation of frequency fees  as well as by charitable donations and the staff care program  as Kyivstar continues to support its employees and the community. Pakistan revenues rose 24.3% YoY in local currency (-2.6% YoY in reported currency)  driven by strong growth in data revenue  despite the negative impact of the increase in withholding tax from 10% to 15% on 16 January 2022  and the further reduction in mobile termination rates from PKR 0.70 last year to PKR 0.40 from 01 July 2022. The weakness in the Pakistani rupee negatively impacted financial performance in reported currency. Jazz grew its subscriber base (+1.5% YoY)  4G users (+17.9% YoY) and ARPU (+22.0% YoY) in 4Q22. EBITDA in Pakistan rose by 86.9% YoY in local currency (+46.9% YoY in reported currency). Revenue and EBITDA performance in 4Q22 was positively impacted by the reversal of a provision following a favorable decision from the Islamabad High Court on pending litigation  increasing recorded revenues by PKR 6.6 billion (c.USD 30 million) and EBITDA by PKR 20.2 billion (c.USD 91 million). Higher energy prices in Pakistan negatively impacted EBITDA margin by c.4 p.p. In Kazakhstan  revenues increased 20.0% YoY in local currency (+10.2% YoY in reported currency)  another quarter of strong growth supported by further expansion of our mobile customer base (+6.8% YoY)  higher data usage (+19.2% YoY) and inflationary pricing of tariffs. This was the seventh consecutive quarter of local-currency revenue YoY growth above 20%  while Beeline Kazakhstan reached 68.3% 4G penetration in the customer base (+4.7 p.p. YoY). EBITDA rose by 7.0% YoY in local currency terms (-1.6% YoY in reported currency). In Bangladesh  Banglalink‚Äôs revenues increased 16.9% YoY in local currency (-2.5% YoY in reported currency). This was the third quarter of double-digit local currency revenue growth. Banglalink‚Äôs execution of its Digital Operator strategy  4G focus and nation-wide expansion continue to deliver results  with the rising number of data and  in particular  4G users  driving growth in data consumption. Banglalink reported balanced expansion of its subscriber base (+7.1% YoY) and ARPU (+5.0% YoY) in 4Q22. EBITDA decreased 9.7% YoY in local currency (-24.7% YoY in reported currency) impacted by the higher network related costs and minimum tax on gross revenue paid in 4Q22. In Uzbekistan  revenues increased 30.3% YoY in local currency (+25.3% YoY in reported currency)  a sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth and a fourth consecutive quarter of revenue growth above 20%. This was driven by a 28.4% YoY expansion in the 4G subscriber base and a solid increase in data revenues  which were 38.9% higher YoY. EBITDA rose 14.4% YoY in local currency (+10.0% YoY in reported currency). As VEON Group strengthens its position for accelerating growth  our 2023 local currency guidance for both revenue and EBITDA is growth of 10%-14%. VEON‚Äôs 2023 outlook for the Group‚Äôs capex intensity is in the range of 18%-20% (See Disclaimer on pages 25-26 below for a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations).

As such  you should not place undue reliance on this information. This information may not be indicative of the actual results for any future period. The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the sanctions imposed by the United States  member states of the European Union  the European Union itself  the United Kingdom  Ukraine and certain other nations  counter-sanctions by Russia and other legal and regulatory responses  as well as responses by our service providers  partners  suppliers and other counterparties  and the consequences of all of the foregoing have impacted and  if the conflict  sanctions and such responses continue or escalate  may significantly impact our results and aspects of our operations in Russia and Ukraine  and may significantly affect our results and aspects of our operations in the other countries in which we operate. We are closely monitoring events in Russia and Ukraine  as well as the possibility of the imposition of further sanctions in connection with the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and any resulting further rise in tensions between Russia and the United States  the United Kingdom and/or the European Union. Although our Russian operations are now classified as ‚Äòheld for sale‚Äô and ‚Äòdiscontinued operations‚Äô and do not contribute to our comparison base or actual reported numbers in this release (except as specifically stated)  our operations in Ukraine continue to be affected by the conflict. We hope that there will be a peaceful and amicable resolution and are doing everything we can to protect the safety of our employees  while continuing to ensure the uninterrupted operation of our communications  financial and digital services. The comprehensive sanctions on investment and vendors in Russia and the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine have had and may continue to have a significant impact on the Company‚Äôs operations and business plans in Russia and Ukraine. During the twelve months-ended 31 December 2022  we have recorded significant impairment charges related to the Russian and Ukrainian operations. We may need to record future impairment charges  which could be significant if the conflict continues or escalates and as more information becomes available to management. It is possible further impairment charges may rise to such a level on an accounting basis as to require additional analysis of true asset values in order to determine the true value of assets to be compared to liabilities as outlined in the provisions of our debt agreements. Due to the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the consequences as mentioned above  the Company requires additional time to complete all necessary disclosures in its Annual Report on Form 20-F to be filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (‚ÄúU.S. SEC‚Äù) as well as its Dutch financial statements to be filed with the Autoriteit Financi√´le Markten (‚ÄúAFM‚Äù)  including completing its preparation of VEON‚Äôs consolidated financial statements and subsequently receiving the related audit report on the financial statements and internal control over financial reporting from its independent registered public accounting firm. As a result  VEON anticipates it will not be able to file its Dutch financial statements with the AFM by April 30  2023  nor its Annual Report on Form 20-F by May 1  2023  the respective deadlines for filing. If VEON is not able to complete these filings by the prescribed deadlines (or the May 16  2023 date for extension of the Form 20-F filing deadline provided by U.S. Securities Exchange Act Rule 12b-25)  it cannot be ruled out that the AFM  Euronext  U.S. SEC or Nasdaq might  following the missed deadline  take action against VEON  which could include imposition of a fine or grant of a further grace period  or in the most extreme cases  deregistration of VEON‚Äôs securities and/or delisting of such securities from Nasdaq and/or Euronext.

Full-year capex of USD 832 million was 2.9% higher than in 2021  with capex intensity up 1.1 p.p. as the company invested in 4G network expansion. Total cash and cash equivalents were USD 3.1 billion  with USD 2.5 billion held at the HQ level.Commenting on the results  Kaan Terzioƒülu said: ‚ÄúIn the final quarter of 2022  we added further operational momentum and recorded double-digit local currency revenue growth in five of our countries  doubling the growth rate from a year ago. With our Russian operations now classified as ‚Äòheld for sale‚Äô and ‚Äòdiscontinued operations‚Äô and not contributing to Group revenues  VEON‚Äôs topline growth in local currency for the full year 2022 was 14.0%. Furthermore  the sale of Russia will result in the significant deleveraging of the Group balance sheet. While we are smaller in size  we are now a faster growing company  serving emerging markets with strong potential demand for the services that VEON‚Äôs Digital Operator 1440 model offers.In 2022  each of our operations achieved significant growth  both in terms of financial performance and the operational metrics that underpin our business. Our local operating companies collectively added 14 million 4G customers  bringing 4G-powered digital ‚Äòmultiplay‚Äô users to 22% of our subscriber base while growing ARPU and customer engagement by providing more relevant connected services for our core telecom users. This strong operational performance has continued and YTD February 2023 local currency revenues are up by 15.2% YoY and local currency EBITDA up by 11.8% YoY. With continued focus on operational performance as well as financial discipline and liquidity management  including our strong liquidity position at year-end  we are well positioned to deliver growth while significantly deleveraging VEON‚Äôs balance sheet and enhancing VEON‚Äôs credit profile in 2023.‚ÄùQ4 2022 highlightsRevenue of USD 940 million  -4.9% YoY (+18.6% YoY in local currency)Service revenue of USD 901 million  -4.4% YoY (+19.2% YoY in local currency)Data and digital revenues of USD 474 million  -7.5% YoY (+15.8% YoY in local currency)EBITDA of USD 453 million  +1.2% YoY (+30.1% YoY in local currency)Capex of USD 263 million  -5.1% YoY  with capex intensity of 22.1%Total cash and cash equivalents of USD 3.1 billion  +37.9% YoY  with USD 2.5 billion at Headquarters157 million mobile subscribers  up 2.7% YoY85 million 4G users  up 19.4% YoY  with 53.9% penetration of customer baseFY 2022 highlightsRevenue of USD 3 755 million  -2.4% YoY (+14.0% YoY in local currency)Service revenue of USD 3 600 million  -2.4% YoY (+13.9% YoY in local currency)Data and digital revenues of USD 1 937 million  -0.7% YoY (+16.5% YoY in local currency)EBITDA of USD 453 million  -5.3% YoY (+12.6% YoY in local currency)Capex of USD 832 million  +2.9% YoY  with capex intensity of 22.1%Total cash and cash equivalents of USD 3.1 billion  +37.9% YoY  with USD 2.5 billion at Headquarters157 million mobile subscribers  up 2.7% YoY85 million 4G users  up 19.4% YoY  with 53.9% penetration of customer baseIn 4Q22  VEON accelerated local currency revenue & EBITDA growth and continued to gain market share in each of its markets. The Group maintained strong liquidity  with Group cash and cash equivalents of USD 3.1 billion as of 31 December 2022.Total Group revenues decreased by 4.9% YoY during 4Q22 in reported currency and increased by 18.6% in local currency terms  with Ukraine revenues growing 8.7% YoY in local currency and all other countries reporting double-digit local currency revenue growth for the period. Service revenues decreased by 4.4% YoY in reported currency and rose by 19.2% YoY in local currency.In 4Q22  Group EBITDA increased by 1.2% YoY in reported currency terms (+30.1% in local currency)  with Group EBITDA margin of 48.2% (+2.9 p.p. YoY). Energy costs increased across the Group +c.30% YoY negatively impacting Group EBITDA margin. We remain focused on implementing planned cost-efficiency measures across the Group and on applying inflationary pricing across our operations. Project Optimum delivered c.USD 95 million of savings in 2022 with cost intensity improving by 2.5 p.p. YoY in local currency.The Group‚Äôs YoY revenues and EBITDA performance was impacted by several extraordinary non-recurring items in 4Q22 and in 4Q21  as noted in the Country Performance section. Excluding these one-off items  Group total revenue increased by 15.4% YoY  service revenue increased by 15.8% YoY and EBITDA increased by 7.4% YoY in local currency.In 4Q22  we reported subscriber base growth of 2.7% YoY. The Group continued to focus on overall customer experience  seeing improving Net Promoter Score (‚ÄúNPS‚Äù) across most of the countries. This supported a 19.4% YoY increase in 4G users  which reached 84.6 million  with 13.8 million users added during the year. As of 31 December 2022  4G subscribers accounted for 53.9% of our total subscriber base  up 7.5 p.p. from a year earlier supporting the execution of VEON‚Äôs Digital Operator strategy.Each of our operations have increased their ARPU levels YoY as they delivered a broader range of services to their customers  achieving greater wallet shares while also implementing inflationary pricing.Our operating companies continued to execute VEON‚Äôs Digital Operator strategy (‚ÄúDO1440‚Äù)  aiming to deliver digital experiences for every minute of the day powered by high-quality mobile internet connectivity. On the back of our growing 4G penetration and with increasing usage of our digital services  we have expanded our multiplay customer base by 40.3% YoY  with 28.4 million multiplay customers at the end of December. While representing just 22% of the user base  multiplay customers were the source of 38.6% of VEON‚Äôs B2C revenues. Multiplay customer ARPU is 3.6 times higher  and churn is 0.4 times lower than for single play voice-only customers.Media streaming services Toffee in Bangladesh and Tamasha in Pakistan were among key drivers of growth in multiplay  as well as our overall digital offering. Toffee in Bangladesh reached 21.2 million monthly active users (‚ÄúMAUs‚Äù) in December 2022  a 3.3-fold YoY increase  with 5.2 million average daily users (5.0 times higher YoY). Tamasha in Pakistan reached 4.3 million MAUs  a 3.5-fold YoY increase.Our digital financial services business in Pakistan  JazzCash  increased its monthly active users by 8.0% YoY  reaching 16.4 million MAUs and increasing its 12-month total transaction volume by 31.3% YoY.In 4Q22  Group capex was USD 263 million  driven by investment in 4G networks in Ukraine  Bangladesh and Uzbekistan  in line with our growth strategy. At 22.1%  capex intensity increased marginally by 1.1 p.p. YoY  primarily due to adverse FX rate movements. We closed the fourth quarter with total cash of USD 3.1 billion  including USD 2.5 billion at the HQ level. Our operations remain largely self-funding.In Ukraine  the team continued to work to keep the country connected  with around 90% of our radio network operational at the end of the quarter. However  over the course of the quarter  damage to Ukrainian power infrastructure impacted network availability at times. Kyivstar‚Äôs revenues were up 8.7% YoY in local currency (-20.7% YoY in reported currency); the Ukrainian hryvnia‚Äôs forex performance negatively impacted reported currency growth rates.

Full-year capex of USD 832 million was 2.9% higher than in 2021  with capex intensity up 1.1 p.p. as the company invested in 4G network expansion. Total cash and cash equivalents were USD 3.1 billion  with USD 2.5 billion held at the HQ level. Commenting on the results  Kaan Terzioƒülu said: ‚ÄúIn the final quarter of 2022  we added further operational momentum and recorded double-digit local currency revenue growth in five of our countries  doubling the growth rate from a year ago. With our Russian operations now classified as ‚Äòheld for sale‚Äô and ‚Äòdiscontinued operations‚Äô and not contributing to Group revenues  VEON‚Äôs topline growth in local currency for the full year 2022 was 14.0%. Furthermore  the sale of Russia will result in the significant deleveraging of the Group balance sheet. While we are smaller in size  we are now a faster growing company  serving emerging markets with strong potential demand for the services that VEON‚Äôs Digital Operator 1440 model offers. In 2022  each of our operations achieved significant growth  both in terms of financial performance and the operational metrics that underpin our business. Our local operating companies collectively added 14 million 4G customers  bringing 4G-powered digital ‚Äòmultiplay‚Äô users to 22% of our subscriber base while growing ARPU and customer engagement by providing more relevant connected services for our core telecom users. This strong operational performance has continued and YTD February 2023 local currency revenues are up by 15.2% YoY and local currency EBITDA up by 11.8% YoY. With continued focus on operational performance as well as financial discipline and liquidity management  including our strong liquidity position at year-end  we are well positioned to deliver growth while significantly deleveraging VEON‚Äôs balance sheet and enhancing VEON‚Äôs credit profile in 2023.‚Äù Q4 2022 highlights Revenue of USD 940 million  -4.9% YoY (+18.6% YoY in local currency)Service revenue of USD 901 million  -4.4% YoY (+19.2% YoY in local currency)Data and digital revenues of USD 474 million  -7.5% YoY (+15.8% YoY in local currency)EBITDA of USD 453 million  +1.2% YoY (+30.1% YoY in local currency)Capex of USD 263 million  -5.1% YoY  with capex intensity of 22.1%Total cash and cash equivalents of USD 3.1 billion  +37.9% YoY  with USD 2.5 billion at Headquarters157 million mobile subscribers  up 2.7% YoY85 million 4G users  up 19.4% YoY  with 53.9% penetration of customer base FY 2022 highlights Revenue of USD 3 755 million  -2.4% YoY (+14.0% YoY in local currency)Service revenue of USD 3 600 million  -2.4% YoY (+13.9% YoY in local currency)Data and digital revenues of USD 1 937 million  -0.7% YoY (+16.5% YoY in local currency)EBITDA of USD 1 743 million  -5.3% YoY (+12.6% YoY in local currency)Capex of USD 832 million  +2.9% YoY  with capex intensity of 22.1%Total cash and cash equivalents of USD 3.1 billion  +37.9% YoY  with USD 2.5 billion at Headquarters157 million mobile subscribers  up 2.7% YoY85 million 4G users  up 19.4% YoY  with 53.9% penetration of customer base In 4Q22  VEON accelerated local currency revenue & EBITDA growth and continued to gain market share in each of its markets. The Group maintained strong liquidity  with Group cash and cash equivalents of USD 3.1 billion as of 31 December 2022. Total Group revenues decreased by 4.9% YoY during 4Q22 in reported currency and increased by 18.6% in local currency terms  with Ukraine revenues growing 8.7% YoY in local currency and all other countries reporting double-digit local currency revenue growth for the period. Service revenues decreased by 4.4% YoY in reported currency and rose by 19.2% YoY in local currency. In 4Q22  Group EBITDA increased by 1.2% YoY in reported currency terms (+30.1% in local currency)  with Group EBITDA margin of 48.2% (+2.9 p.p. YoY). Energy costs increased across the Group +c.30% YoY negatively impacting Group EBITDA margin. We remain focused on implementing planned cost-efficiency measures across the Group and on applying inflationary pricing across our operations. Project Optimum delivered c.USD 95 million of savings in 2022 with cost intensity improving by 2.5 p.p. YoY in local currency. The Group‚Äôs YoY revenues and EBITDA performance was impacted by several extraordinary non-recurring items in 4Q22 and in 4Q21  as noted in the Country Performance section. Excluding these one-off items  Group total revenue increased by 15.4% YoY  service revenue increased by 15.8% YoY and EBITDA increased by 7.4% YoY in local currency. In 4Q22  we reported subscriber base growth of 2.7% YoY. The Group continued to focus on overall customer experience  seeing improving Net Promoter Score (‚ÄúNPS‚Äù) across most of the countries. This supported a 19.4% YoY increase in 4G users  which reached 84.6 million  with 13.8 million users added during the year. As of 31 December 2022  4G subscribers accounted for 53.9% of our total subscriber base  up 7.5 p.p. from a year earlier supporting the execution of VEON‚Äôs Digital Operator strategy. Each of our operations have increased their ARPU levels YoY as they delivered a broader range of services to their customers  achieving greater wallet shares while also implementing inflationary pricing. Our operating companies continued to execute VEON‚Äôs Digital Operator strategy (‚ÄúDO1440‚Äù)  aiming to deliver digital experiences for every minute of the day powered by high-quality mobile internet connectivity. On the back of our growing 4G penetration and with increasing usage of our digital services  we have expanded our multiplay customer base by 40.3% YoY  with 28.4 million multiplay customers at the end of December. While representing just 22% of the user base  multiplay customers were the source of 38.6% of VEON‚Äôs B2C revenues. Multiplay customer ARPU is 3.6 times higher  and churn is 0.4 times lower than for single play voice-only customers. Media streaming services Toffee in Bangladesh and Tamasha in Pakistan were among key drivers of growth in multiplay  as well as our overall digital offering. Toffee in Bangladesh reached 21.2 million monthly active users (‚ÄúMAUs‚Äù) in December 2022  a 3.3-fold YoY increase  with 5.2 million average daily users (5.0 times higher YoY). Tamasha in Pakistan reached 4.3 million MAUs  a 3.5-fold YoY increase. Our digital financial services business in Pakistan  JazzCash  increased its monthly active users by 8.0% YoY  reaching 16.4 million MAUs and increasing its 12-month total transaction volume by 31.3% YoY. In 4Q22  Group capex was USD 263 million  driven by investment in 4G networks in Ukraine  Bangladesh and Uzbekistan  in line with our growth strategy. At 22.1%  capex intensity increased marginally by 1.1 p.p. YoY  primarily due to adverse FX rate movements. We closed the fourth quarter with total cash of USD 3.1 billion  including USD 2.5 billion at the HQ level. Our operations remain largely self-funding. In Ukraine  the team continued to work to keep the country connected  with around 90% of our radio network operational at the end of the quarter. However  over the course of the quarter  damage to Ukrainian power infrastructure impacted network availability at times. Kyivstar‚Äôs revenues were up 8.7% YoY in local currency (-20.7% YoY in reported currency); the Ukrainian hryvnia‚Äôs forex performance negatively impacted reported currency growth rates. Kyivstar‚Äôs 4G customer base grew 8.2% YoY  and our customers consumed more data  with data usage rising 26.3% YoY. EBITDA decreased by 7.3% YoY in local currency (-32.4% YoY in reported currency) in 4Q22. EBITDA performance was impacted by the change in revenue mix impacting margins  operational cost pressures including energy costs  indexation of frequency fees  as well as by charitable donations and the staff care program  as Kyivstar continues to support its employees and the community. Pakistan revenues rose 24.3% YoY in local currency (-2.6% YoY in reported currency)  driven by strong growth in data revenue  despite the negative impact of the increase in withholding tax from 10% to 15% on 16 January 2022  and the further reduction in mobile termination rates from PKR 0.70 last year to PKR 0.40 from 01 July 2022. The weakness in the Pakistani rupee negatively impacted financial performance in reported currency. Jazz grew its subscriber base (+1.5% YoY)  4G users (+17.9% YoY) and ARPU (+22.0% YoY) in 4Q22. EBITDA in Pakistan rose by 86.9% YoY in local currency (+46.9% YoY in reported currency). Revenue and EBITDA performance in 4Q22 was positively impacted by the reversal of a provision following a favorable decision from the Islamabad High Court on pending litigation  increasing recorded revenues by PKR 6.6 billion (c.USD 30 million) and EBITDA by PKR 20.2 billion (c.USD 91 million). Higher energy prices in Pakistan negatively impacted EBITDA margin by c.4 p.p. In Kazakhstan  revenues increased 20.0% YoY in local currency (+10.2% YoY in reported currency)  another quarter of strong growth supported by further expansion of our mobile customer base (+6.8% YoY)  higher data usage (+19.2% YoY) and inflationary pricing of tariffs. This was the seventh consecutive quarter of local-currency revenue YoY growth above 20%  while Beeline Kazakhstan reached 68.3% 4G penetration in the customer base (+4.7 p.p. YoY). EBITDA rose by 7.0% YoY in local currency terms (-1.6% YoY in reported currency). In Bangladesh  Banglalink‚Äôs revenues increased 16.9% YoY in local currency (-2.5% YoY in reported currency). This was the third quarter of double-digit local currency revenue growth. Banglalink‚Äôs execution of its Digital Operator strategy  4G focus and nation-wide expansion continue to deliver results  with the rising number of data and  in particular  4G users  driving growth in data consumption. Banglalink reported balanced expansion of its subscriber base (+7.1% YoY) and ARPU (+5.0% YoY) in 4Q22. EBITDA decreased 9.7% YoY in local currency (-24.7% YoY in reported currency) impacted by the higher network related costs and minimum tax on gross revenue paid in 4Q22. In Uzbekistan  revenues increased 30.3% YoY in local currency (+25.3% YoY in reported currency)  a sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth and a fourth consecutive quarter of revenue growth above 20%. This was driven by a 28.4% YoY expansion in the 4G subscriber base and a solid increase in data revenues  which were 38.9% higher YoY. EBITDA rose 14.4% YoY in local currency (+10.0% YoY in reported currency). As VEON Group strengthens its position for accelerating growth  our 2023 local currency guidance for both revenue and EBITDA is growth of 10%-14%. VEON‚Äôs 2023 outlook for the Group‚Äôs capex intensity is in the range of 18%-20% (See Disclaimer on pages 25-26 below for a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations).

As such  you should not place undue reliance on this information. This information may not be indicative of the actual results for any future period. The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the sanctions imposed by the United States  member states of the European Union  the European Union itself  the United Kingdom  Ukraine and certain other nations  counter-sanctions by Russia and other legal and regulatory responses  as well as responses by our service providers  partners  suppliers and other counterparties  and the consequences of all of the foregoing have impacted and  if the conflict  sanctions and such responses continue or escalate  may significantly impact our results and aspects of our operations in Russia and Ukraine  and may significantly affect our results and aspects of our operations in the other countries in which we operate. We are closely monitoring events in Russia and Ukraine  as well as the possibility of the imposition of further sanctions in connection with the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and any resulting further rise in tensions between Russia and the United States  the United Kingdom and/or the European Union. Although our Russian operations are now classified as ‚Äòheld for sale‚Äô and ‚Äòdiscontinued operations‚Äô and do not contribute to our comparison base or actual reported numbers in this release (except as specifically stated)  our operations in Ukraine continue to be affected by the conflict. We hope that there will be a peaceful and amicable resolution and are doing everything we can to protect the safety of our employees  while continuing to ensure the uninterrupted operation of our communications  financial and digital services. The comprehensive sanctions on investment and vendors in Russia and the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine have had and may continue to have a significant impact on the Company‚Äôs operations and business plans in Russia and Ukraine. During the twelve months-ended 31 December 2022  we have recorded significant impairment charges related to the Russian and Ukrainian operations. We may need to record future impairment charges  which could be significant if the conflict continues or escalates and as more information becomes available to management. It is possible further impairment charges may rise to such a level on an accounting basis as to require additional analysis of true asset values in order to determine the true value of assets to be compared to liabilities as outlined in the provisions of our debt agreements. Due to the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the consequences as mentioned above  the Company requires additional time to complete all necessary disclosures in its Annual Report on Form 20-F to be filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (‚ÄúU.S. SEC‚Äù) as well as its Dutch financial statements to be filed with the Autoriteit Financi√´le Markten (‚ÄúAFM‚Äù)  including completing its preparation of VEON‚Äôs consolidated financial statements and subsequently receiving the related audit report on the financial statements and internal control over financial reporting from its independent registered public accounting firm. As a result  VEON anticipates it will not be able to file its Dutch financial statements with the AFM by April 30  2023  nor its Annual Report on Form 20-F by May 1  2023  the respective deadlines for filing. If VEON is not able to complete these filings by the prescribed deadlines (or the May 16  2023 date for extension of the Form 20-F filing deadline provided by U.S. Securities Exchange Act Rule 12b-25)  it cannot be ruled out that the AFM  Euronext  U.S. SEC or Nasdaq might  following the missed deadline  take action against VEON  which could include imposition of a fine or grant of a further grace period  or in the most extreme cases  deregistration of VEON‚Äôs securities and/or delisting of such securities from Nasdaq and/or Euronext.

Sanofi announces that it will cut the list price of Lantus (insulin glargine injection) 100 Units/mL  its most widely prescribed insulin in the U.S.  by 78 percent. The company also will establish a $35 cap on out-of-pocket costs for Lantus for all patients with commercial insurance  underscoring its longstanding commitment to offer affordable access to medicines.These moves  which go into effect January 1  2024  will come in addition to decisions taken in June 2022 to lower diabetes medicines costs: the launch of an unbranded Lantus biologic at -60% versus Lantus list price  and a cap on out-of-pocket costs on insulin to $35 for all people without insurance. With all those decisions  now Sanofi‚Äôs suite of savings programs ensures that no patient will pay more than $35 for a monthly supply of Lantus. Finally  Sanofi will also cut the list price of its short-acting Apidra (insulin glulisine injection) 100 Units/mL by 70%.Olivier BogillotHead  U.S. General Medicines  Sanofi‚ÄúSanofi believes that no one should struggle to pay for their insulin and we are proud of our continued actions to improve access and affordability for millions of patients for many years. We launched our unbranded biologic for Lantus at 60 percent less than the Lantus list price in June 2022 but  despite this pioneering low-price approach  the health system was unable to take advantage of it due to its inherent structural challenges. We are pleased to see others join our efforts to help patients as we now accelerate the transformation of the U.S. insulin market. Our decision to cut the list price of our lead insulin needs to be coupled with broader change to the overall system to actually drive savings for patients at the pharmacy counter.‚ÄùSanofi Savings ProgramsSanofi will continue to provide different programs to ensure access and affordability to patients depending on their coverage situations and will continue to monitor policy and market changes. Our suite of innovative programs includes:100% of commercially insured people are eligible for Sanofi‚Äôs copay assistance programs  regardless of income or insurance plan design  which  in 2022 limited out-of-pocket expenses for a majority of participating patients to $15 or less for their diabetes medicines for a 30-day supply.people are eligible for Sanofi‚Äôs copay assistance programs  regardless of income or insurance plan design  which  in 2022 limited out-of-pocket expenses for a majority of participating patients to $15 or less for their diabetes medicines for a 30-day supply. 100% of uninsured people are eligible for the Insulins Valyou Savings Program ‚Äì regardless of income level ‚Äì enabling them to buy one or multiple Sanofi insulins at $35 for a 30-day supply.

Sanofi announces that it will cut the list price of Lantus (insulin glargine injection) 100 Units/mL  its most widely prescribed insulin in the U.S.  by 78 percent. The company also will establish a $35 cap on out-of-pocket costs for Lantus for all patients with commercial insurance  underscoring its longstanding commitment to offer affordable access to medicines.These moves  which go into effect January 1  2024  will come in addition to decisions taken in June 2022 to lower diabetes medicines costs: the launch of an unbranded Lantus biologic at -60% versus Lantus list price  and a cap on out-of-pocket costs on insulin to $35 for all people without insurance. With all those decisions  now Sanofi‚Äôs suite of savings programs ensures that no patient will pay more than $35 for a monthly supply of Lantus. Finally  Sanofi will also cut the list price of its short-acting Apidra (insulin glulisine injection) 100 Units/mL by 70%.Olivier BogillotHead  U.S. General Medicines  Sanofi‚ÄúSanofi believes that no one should struggle to pay for their insulin and we are proud of our continued actions to improve access and affordability for millions of patients for many years. We launched our unbranded biologic for Lantus at 60 percent less than the Lantus list price in June 2022 but  despite this pioneering low-price approach  the health system was unable to take advantage of it due to its inherent structural challenges. We are pleased to see others join our efforts to help patients as we now accelerate the transformation of the U.S. insulin market. Our decision to cut the list price of our lead insulin needs to be coupled with broader change to the overall system to actually drive savings for patients at the pharmacy counter.‚ÄùSanofi Savings ProgramsSanofi will continue to provide different programs to ensure access and affordability to patients depending on their coverage situations and will continue to monitor policy and market changes. Our suite of innovative programs includes:100% of commercially insured people are eligible for Sanofi‚Äôs copay assistance programs  regardless of income or insurance plan design  which  in 2022 limited out-of-pocket expenses for a majority of participating patients to $15 or less for their diabetes medicines for a 30-day supply.people are eligible for Sanofi‚Äôs copay assistance programs  regardless of income or insurance plan design  which  in 2022 limited out-of-pocket expenses for a majority of participating patients to $15 or less for their diabetes medicines for a 30-day supply. 100% of uninsured people are eligible for the Insulins Valyou Savings Program ‚Äì regardless of income level ‚Äì enabling them to buy one or multiple Sanofi insulins at $35 for a 30-day supply. The Soliqua (insulin glargine and lixisenatide) injection 100 Units/mL and 33 mcg/mL cash offer also allows uninsured people to pay as little as $99 per box of pens  for up to two boxes of pens for a 30-day supply.people are eligible for the Insulins Valyou Savings Program ‚Äì regardless of income level ‚Äì enabling them to buy one or multiple Sanofi insulins at $35 for a 30-day supply.

We also provide free medications to qualified low- and middle-income patients the Sanofi Patient Connection program. Some people facing an unexpected financial hardship may be eligible for a one-time  immediate month‚Äôs supply of their Sanofi medicine as they wait for their application to process.Beginning in 2023  Sanofi insulins and Soliqua are included under the Inflation Reduction Act  where covered on Medicare formulary  which provides insulin savings  capping monthly cost at $35 for Seniors who have Medicare Part D. This ensures a predictable  stable co-pay  regardless of phase including the donut hole. Prior to the Inflation Reduction Act  Sanofi voluntarily participated in part of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services‚Äô (CMS) Senior Savings Model which allowed patients enrolled in participating Part D plans to pay a $35 or less co-pay for each 30-day prescription of a Sanofi insulin throughout the year.Every patient has unique circumstances  and Sanofi has live support specialists who can be reached at (855) 984-6302 to answer individual patient‚Äôs questions and navigate their unique situation to find the best resources and programs to help lower their out-of-pocket costs.Learn more about Sanofi‚Äôs transparent approach to pricing in our 2023 Pricing Principles Report.About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people‚Äôs lives.

The multicenter  randomized  double blind  placebo- and active-controlled Phase III study was conducted in 7 European countries and Hong Kong and included a total of 743 patients. The study did not meet the primary and consequently the key secondary endpoints  despite JTA-004‚Äôs favorable safety profile. The final report was recently communicated to EudraCT (2019-000796-16).In March 2022  in the journal ‚ÄòAnnals of the Rheumatic Diseases‚Äô1  a peer-reviewed paper formally identified three subtypes of OA  amongst which a subtype of OA patients with more severe symptoms and inflammation. A better understanding of disease stratification to classify patients with OA provided the input for this fresh  in-depth post hoc analysis. BioSenic has used the statistical analysis capabilities of Artialis to study the results of the Phase III JTA-004 trial in the subset of patients with the most painful and inflammatory form of OA. This allowed BioSenic to distinguish a group of patients  representing about one third of the total patients  who show a pain-relieving effect of JTA-004 not only superior to placebo but also to the active comparator.By identifying three subtypes of OA  amongst which a subtype of OA patients with more severe symptoms and inflammation  this new post-hoc analysis changes the therapeutic profile of the molecule and potentially allows for the possibility of stratifying patients for a new  optimized Phase III clinical study. BioSenic  which does not intend to allocate R&D resources to support the clinical development of JTA-004 and will continue to focus its R&D activities on the development of its autoimmune (ATO) and cell therapy (ALLOB) platforms  is now seeking to collaborate with existing and potential partners to explore options for the future development of JTA-004 based on this new post-hoc analysis.Following the data of the Arthritis Foundation  OA is now recognized as a disease of the whole joint  affecting more than 32.5 million adults in the United States. By far the most common form of arthritis  OA does not yet have any drugs that can slow or modify the disease and only offers transitory relief of symptoms.JTA-004 was designed as a next generation of intra-articular injectable for the treatment of osteoarthritic pain in the knee. Consisting of a unique patented mix of plasma proteins  hyaluronic acid - a natural component of knee synovial fluid  and a fast-acting analgesic  JTA-004 was designed to provide added lubrication and protection to the cartilage of the arthritic joint and to alleviate OA pain.""These new data demonstrate that JTA-004 may have the potential to provide an improved treatment for the most affected osteoarthritis patients that suffer from severe chronic pain and active  mostly progressive  inflammatory disease that is an under-served medical need "" said Fran√ßois Rieger  PhD  BioSenic's Chairman and CEO. ""As a result  this opens up fresh options for BioSenic in addition to our current multiple autoimmune and cell therapy platforms. BioSenic will formally publish the fresh JTA-004 post hoc analysis results in a peer-reviewed paper in the second half of 2023 and will meanwhile explore multiple options for the further development of JTA  with potential partnership options and potential additional clinical development.‚ÄùAbout BioSenicBioSenic is a biotech company focused on (i) the development of innovative products to address high unmet needs in orthopedics and (ii) exploiting the possibilities offered by the therapeutic use of arsenic salts (mainly arsenic trioxide (ATO) for patients with autoimmune diseases. Key target indications for the platforms include Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD)  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) and high-risk tibial fractures and other orthopedics indications  such as osteoarthritis  by combining new and tested  IP protected  techniques.Following the merger in October 2022  BioSenic combines the strategic positionings and strengths of Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics. The merger also enables Biosenic to add to its innovative cell therapy platform and strong IP for tissue repair or protection with an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/OATO.BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About BioSenic technology platformsBioSenic‚Äôs technology is based on two main platforms:1) The allogeneic cell and gene therapy platform  developed by BioSenic with differentiated bone marrow sourced Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) that can be stored at the point of use in hospitals. Its current investigational medicinal product  ALLOB  represents a unique  proprietary approach to organ repair and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells on the site of injury after a single local injection. These cells are produced via a BioSenic's scalable manufacturing process. Following the CTA approval by regulatory authorities in Europe  BioSenic has initiated patient recruitment for the Phase IIb clinical trial with ALLOB in patients with difficult tibial fractures  using its optimized production process. ALLOB is currently being evaluated in a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase IIb study in patients with high-risk tibial fractures  using its optimized production process  after a successful first safety and efficacy study (Phase 1/2a) on fractured long bones  with late delayed union. The patient recruitment has been halted late February 2023 with 57 patients and the new rules permitted for statistical analysis should allow BioSenic to get the main results of this trial much earlier than anticipated in the original protocol  since they are expected by mid-2023.2) The Arsenic TriOxide (ATO) platform developed by Medsenic. The immunomodulatory properties of ATO have demonstrated a double basic effect on cells of the immune system. The first effect is the increase of the cell oxidative stress in activated B  T or other cells of the innate/adaptative immune system to the point they will enter a cell death program (apoptosis) and be eliminated. The second effect is potent immunomodulatory properties on several pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in inflammatory or autoimmune cell pathways. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. GvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). GvHD is primarily mediated by the transplanted immune system that can lead to severe multiorgan damage. Medsenic had been successful in a Phase II trial with its intravenous formulation  allowing arsenic trioxide to be granted an orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA and is heading towards an international Phase III confirmatory study  with a new  IP protected  oral (OATO) formulation.Moderate to Severe forms of Systemic Lupus erythematosus (SLE) is another selected target  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastro-intestinal tract) in a Phase IIa study.Systemic Sclerosis is  in addition  part of the clinical pipeline of BioSenic. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive. This gives good grounds to launch a Phase II clinical protocol for this serious disease that badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and with no actual current effective treatment.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAPr.

BioSenic will formally publish the fresh JTA-004 post hoc analysis results in a peer-reviewed paper in the second half of 2023 and will meanwhile explore multiple options for the further development of JTA  with potential partnership options and potential additional clinical development.‚ÄùAbout BioSenicBioSenic is a biotech company focused on (i) the development of innovative products to address high unmet needs in orthopedics and (ii) exploiting the possibilities offered by the therapeutic use of arsenic salts (mainly arsenic trioxide (ATO) for patients with autoimmune diseases. Key target indications for the platforms include Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD)  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) and high-risk tibial fractures and other orthopedics indications  such as osteoarthritis  by combining new and tested  IP protected  techniques.Following the merger in October 2022  BioSenic combines the strategic positionings and strengths of Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics. The merger also enables Biosenic to add to its innovative cell therapy platform and strong IP for tissue repair or protection with an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/OATO.BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About BioSenic technology platformsBioSenic‚Äôs technology is based on two main platforms:1) The allogeneic cell and gene therapy platform  developed by BioSenic with differentiated bone marrow sourced Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) that can be stored at the point of use in hospitals. Its current investigational medicinal product  ALLOB  represents a unique  proprietary approach to organ repair and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells on the site of injury after a single local injection. These cells are produced via a BioSenic's scalable manufacturing process. Following the CTA approval by regulatory authorities in Europe  BioSenic has initiated patient recruitment for the Phase IIb clinical trial with ALLOB in patients with difficult tibial fractures  using its optimized production process. ALLOB is currently being evaluated in a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase IIb study in patients with high-risk tibial fractures  using its optimized production process  after a successful first safety and efficacy study (Phase 1/2a) on fractured long bones  with late delayed union. The patient recruitment has been halted late February 2023 with 57 patients and the new rules permitted for statistical analysis should allow BioSenic to get the main results of this trial much earlier than anticipated in the original protocol  since they are expected by mid-2023.2) The Arsenic TriOxide (ATO) platform developed by Medsenic. The immunomodulatory properties of ATO have demonstrated a double basic effect on cells of the immune system. The first effect is the increase of the cell oxidative stress in activated B  T or other cells of the innate/adaptative immune system to the point they will enter a cell death program (apoptosis) and be eliminated. The second effect is potent immunomodulatory properties on several pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in inflammatory or autoimmune cell pathways. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. GvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). GvHD is primarily mediated by the transplanted immune system that can lead to severe multiorgan damage. Medsenic had been successful in a Phase II trial with its intravenous formulation  allowing arsenic trioxide to be granted an orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA and is heading towards an international Phase III confirmatory study  with a new  IP protected  oral (OATO) formulation.Moderate to Severe forms of Systemic Lupus erythematosus (SLE) is another selected target  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastro-intestinal tract) in a Phase IIa study.Systemic Sclerosis is  in addition  part of the clinical pipeline of BioSenic. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive. This gives good grounds to launch a Phase II clinical protocol for this serious disease that badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and with no actual current effective treatment.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAPr.

As a Group  we delivered strong results in line with our guidance  demonstrated rapid progress against the strategy presented at our listing and strengthened our financial position. In Content production & distribution  strong profitable growth is linked both to new shows  including scripted hits Marie-Antoinette and SAS Rogue Heroes  and the continued evolution of our unscripted superbrand offering built on powerful IP such as Masterchef  Big Brother and Survivor which are relaunching in key markets and entering new territories. This production  as well as our successful execution of 15 bolt on acquisitions in 10 territories have driven a 30% increase of our overall content catalog  cementing our position as the number one global independent content producer. We are perfectly positioned in this business to capture market consolidation opportunities going forward. In Online sports betting & gaming  the growth of our revenues has been also very strong  despite a high comparison base in 2021. The overall number of Unique Active Players increased by 25%  powered in part by our strong commercial performance during the football World Cup. Betclic has been the most downloaded sports betting app in our core markets of France  Poland and Portugal  and the second most downloaded across Europe  thanks to our state-of-the-art technology platform which leads the way in terms of reliability and efficiency.

Alternative performance measuresThe financial information in this release includes non-IFRS financial measures and ratios (e.g. non-IFRS metrics  such as adjusted EBITDA) that are not recognized as measures of financial performance or liquidity under IFRS. The non-IFRS financial measures presented are measures used by management to monitor the underlying performance of the business and operations and  have therefore not been audited or reviewed. Furthermore  they may not be indicative of the historical operating results  nor are they meant to be predictive of future results. These non-IFRS measures are presented because they are considered important supplementary measurements of FL Entertainment N.V.'s (the ""Company"") performance  and we believe that these and similar measures are widely used in the industry in which the Company operates as a way to evaluate a company‚Äôs operating performance and liquidity. Not all companies calculate non-IFRS financial measures in the same manner or on a consistent basis. As a result  these measures and ratios may not be comparable to measures used by other companies under the same or similar names.Regulated information related to this press release is available on the website:https://www.flentertainment.com/results-center/https://www.flentertainment.com/ APPENDIX Glossary Transaction: business combination with Pegasus Entrepreneurial Acquisition Company Europe B.V.  a special purpose acquisition company to become a listed company on Euronext Amsterdam as well as the Group‚Äôs reorganization Adjusted EBITDA: for a period is defined as the operating profit for that period excluding restructuring costs and other non-core items  costs associated with the long-term incentive plan within the Group (the ""LTIP"") and employment related earn-out and option expenses  and depreciation and amortization (excluding D&A fiction).

As a Group  we delivered strong results in line with our guidance  demonstrated rapid progress against the strategy presented at our listing and strengthened our financial position. In Content production & distribution  strong profitable growth is linked both to new shows  including scripted hits Marie-Antoinette and SAS Rogue Heroes  and the continued evolution of our unscripted superbrand offering built on powerful IP such as Masterchef  Big Brother and Survivor which are relaunching in key markets and entering new territories. This production  as well as our successful execution of 15 bolt on acquisitions in 10 territories have driven a 30% increase of our overall content catalog  cementing our position as the number one global independent content producer. We are perfectly positioned in this business to capture market consolidation opportunities going forward. In Online sports betting & gaming  the growth of our revenues has been also very strong  despite a high comparison base in 2021. The overall number of Unique Active Players increased by 25%  powered in part by our strong commercial performance during the football World Cup. Betclic has been the most downloaded sports betting app in our core markets of France  Poland and Portugal  and the second most downloaded across Europe  thanks to our state-of-the-art technology platform which leads the way in terms of reliability and efficiency.

Merola JF  Asahina A  Gisondi P et al.# 43744Notes to editors:About bimekizumabBimekizumab is a humanized monoclonal IgG1 antibody that is designed to selectively inhibit both interleukin 17A (IL-17A) and interleukin 17F (IL-17F)  two key cytokines driving inflammatory processes.5 7 In the U.S.  the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab have not been established for any indication and it is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.In August 2021  bimekizumab was first approved in the European Union (EU)/European Economic Area (EEA) and in Great Britain  for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy.5 6 The label information may differ in other countries where approved. Please check local prescribing information.About BIMZELX¬Æ‚ñº(bimekizumab) in the EU/EEA In the EU/EEA  BIMZELX¬Æ is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy.5BIMZELX¬Æ‚ñº(bimekizumab) EU/EEA Important Safety Information in PsoriasisThe most frequently reported adverse reactions with bimekizumab were upper respiratory tract infections (14.5%) (most frequently nasopharyngitis) and oral candidiasis (7.3%). Common adverse reactions (‚â•1/100 to <1/10) were oral candidiasis  tinea infections  ear infections  herpes simplex infections  oropharyngeal candidiasis  gastroenteritis  folliculitis  headache  dermatitis and eczema  acne  injection site reactions  fatigue. Elderly may be more likely to experience certain adverse reactions such as oral candidiasis  dermatitis and eczema when using bimekizumab.Bimekizumab is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the excipients and in patients with clinically important active infections (e.g. active tuberculosis).Bimekizumab may increase the risk of infections. Treatment with bimekizumab must not be administered in patients with any clinically important active infection. Patients treated with bimekizumab should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms suggestive of an infection occur. Prior to initiating treatment with bimekizumab  patients should be evaluated for tuberculosis (TB) infection. Bimekizumab should not be given in patients with active TB and patients receiving bimekizumab should be monitored for signs and symptoms of active TB.Cases of new or exacerbations of inflammatory bowel disease have been reported with bimekizumab. Bimekizumab is not recommended in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. If a patient develops signs and symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease or experiences an exacerbation of pre-existing inflammatory bowel disease  bimekizumab should be discontinued and appropriate medical management should be initiated. Serious hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions have been observed with IL-17 inhibitors. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs  administration of bimekizumab should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated.Live vaccines should not be given in patients treated with bimekizumab.Please consult the summary of product characteristics in relation to other side effects  full safety and prescribing information. https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/product-information/bimzelx-epar-product-information_en.pdfEU summary of product characteristics date of revision December 2022.Last accessed: March 2023.‚ñºThis medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring.

These forward-looking statements are based on current plans  estimates and beliefs of management. All statements  other than statements of historical facts  are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements  including estimates of revenues  operating margins  capital expenditures  cash  other financial information  expected legal  arbitration  political  regulatory or clinical results or practices and other such estimates and results. By their nature  such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and assumptions which might cause the actual results  financial condition  performance or achievements of UCB  or industry results  to differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Important factors that could result in such differences include: the global spread and impact of COVID-19  changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  will progress to product approval or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products  which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB's efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover  sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment  including pricing pressure  political and public scrutiny  customer and prescriber patterns or practices  and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes. Finally  a breakdown  cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality  integrity and availability of UCB's data and systems.Given these uncertainties  you should not place undue reliance on any of such forward-looking statements.

(""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (Euronext Amsterdam: PHARM) (Nasdaq: PHAR) presents its preliminary (unaudited) financial report for the full year ended December 31  2022.Chief Executive Officer  Sijmen de Vries commented:""2022 was a pivotal year for Pharming. It was a year in which we prioritized our efforts in rare diseases and affirmed our commitment to our purpose of serving the unserved rare disease patient. It is this priority and commitment that forms the foundation as we build Pharming into a leading  global rare disease company across multiple geographies  with multiple products  a well-defined pipeline and with the necessary commercial infrastructure in place to enhance our future ambition.Beginning in early 2022  we put into motion a bold strategy and made significant regulatory progress in advancing leniolisib towards marketing approval. In the U.S. and Europe  dossiers were filed and validated  with plans for the U.K. filing in the second half of 2023 remaining on track.We also announced positive Phase 3 clinical trial data for leniolisib with our findings published in Blood  the peer reviewed international medical journal of the American Society of Hematology. This was followed by the presentation of positive interim analysis data from the open label extension study at the 64th American Society Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting.In preparation for the FDA PDUFA goal date of March 29 in the U.S.  and to ensure commercial success with what will be our second marketed product  Pharming began investing significantly in its commercial infrastructure both in the U.S. and Europe from the third quarter. With this ramp up of commercial capabilities  we feel we are well positioned to successfully commercialize leniolisib in the U.S. shortly after receiving a positive decision. Looking to Europe  having those commercial capabilities already in place will be vital to executing our launch strategy following a positive CHMP opinion expected in the second half of 2023 and marketing authorisation expected approximately two months later.To support leniolisib and our broader growth ambitions in the rare disease space  we will continue advancing our pipeline via internal projects  as well as through potential in-licensing or acquisitions. The focus of these potential opportunities would target rare disease assets in mid to-late stage development  including assets with a clinical-proof-of-concept where we feel comfortable taking Phase III clinical risk. Internally  our focus will be additional indications for leniolisib  as well as the advancement of OTL-105 for the treatment of HAE.With a clear foundation laid  and a great start to our strategic execution  we have much to be proud of in 2022. I would like to thank our employees  our partners and suppliers and all of those who worked tirelessly to make this year such a success. We look forward to continuing to execute on our strategic objectives in 2023 as we follow through on Pharming's vision to become a leading  global rare disease company.""Strategic highlightsIn 2022  we prioritized our efforts on rare diseases and executed on a number of our strategic objectives to help build a sustainable global rare disease business focused on RUCONEST¬Æ sales  the approval  launch and commercialization of leniolisib for activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3KŒ¥) syndrome (APDS) in key markets  and the ongoing development and management of our pipeline.We significantly expanded our organization and headcount in 2022  especially in the second half of the year when we added commercial and medical affairs personnel to support market development and to prepare for the anticipated launch and commercialization of leniolisib for APDS. These investments are in line with our strategy to become a global  multi-product  rare disease company.In line with our renewed focus on rare diseases  we are advancing the development of our pipeline through a combination of internal development projects - including the development of additional indications for leniolisib  as well as OTL-105 as a gene therapy for HAE - and the potential acquisition or in-licensing of mid to late-stage assets.Investments in our internal pipeline projects and potential acquisitions and in-licensing will be financed through a combination of positive cash flow from the RUCONEST¬Æ business  anticipated future leniolisib business  and available cash from our strong balance sheet. If required  Pharming may access additional funding from the capital markets.Leniolisib development and commercializationFor leniolisib  Pharming has a three-step approach planned for the coming years.The first step is the anticipated regulatory approval and commercial launch of leniolisib for the treatment of activated PI3K delta syndrome (APDS) in adults and adolescents aged 12 and older in the U.S. during the first half of 2023. This will be followed by key markets in the European Economic Area (EEA) and the U.K.  subject to an anticipated positive CHMP opinion in the second half of 2023. The Company currently plans to pursue regulatory approvals in Japan  Canada  and Australia  and will evaluate additional countries and regions for product expansion  and will commercialize the product either directly or through strategic distribution partnerships.The second step includes clinical development and regulatory approvals to expand the marketing of leniolisib as a treatment for APDS to children as young as one year of age.The third step is the development of leniolisib in additional indications beyond APDS. Prioritization and preclinical testing work is ongoing and we expect to announce further details on our plans to develop leniolisib in additional indications in the second half of 2023.Leniolisib clinical dataIn February 2022  Pharming announced positive results from the pivotal Phase II/III blinded randomized  placebo-controlled registration-enabling study of leniolisib for the treatment of APDS in adults and adolescents aged 12 years or older. Data from this trial was presented at the Clinical Immunology Society 2022 Annual Meeting in April 2022 and published in Blood  the peer-reviewed international medical journal of the American Society of Hematology  in December 2022. Also in December 2022  positive interim analysis data from the open-label extension study evaluating leniolisib as a treatment for adult and adolescent patients 12 years or older with APDS was shared in an oral presentation at the 64th American Society Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting.Addressable global market opportunitiesPharming believes there are more than 1 500 patients with APDS living in the United States  Europe  Japan  Australia  Canada  and Israel. This figure is based on current populations and available literature which estimates the prevalence of the disease to be approximately 1 to 2 patients per million.To date  we have identified more than 500 patients with a confirmed APDS diagnosis in the countries where we intend to initially commercialize leniolisib. These patients have been found through the efforts of our disease educators and patient finders  as well as through our genetic testing partnership with Invitae  which offers free of charge genetic testing to US-based clinicians who believe they may have a patient with APDS. A genetic test enables a clinician to confirm their clinical suspicions and definitively diagnose APDS.U.S. marketIn 2022  the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted for priority review Pharming's New Drug Application (NDA) for leniolisib to treat adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older with APDS. The FDA assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date of March 29  2023. We currently remain on track for the FDA decision on leniolisib  followed by the anticipated commercial launch in the second quarter of 2023.In anticipation of a positive decision by the FDA  in the second half of 2022 we grew our US commercial infrastructure  including our field force  and leveraged our marketing capabilities to prepare for the successful commercialization of leniolisib.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) added a new diagnosis for APDS to the International Classification of Diseases  10th Revision  Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM)  formally recognizing APDS as a discrete immunological disease. The diagnosis code  D81.82 ‚Äí Activated Phosphoinositide 3-kinase Delta Syndrome (APDS)  took effect on October 1  2022. The assignment of the ICD-10-CM code by the CDC enables physicians and payors in the U.S. to add a diagnosis of APDS to patients' health records  which will help connect these individuals with researchers studying the prevalence and course of the disease. In addition  by allocating a specific diagnosis  the new ICD-10-CM code may help confirm medical necessity in individual patients  thus improving their access to relevant care options through U.S. health insurance plans.EEA and U.K. marketIn the EEA  Pharming submitted a marketing authorisation application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for leniolisib as a treatment for APDS in adults and adolescents aged 12 and older. Our dossier was filed and validated by EMA in October 2022 under the accelerated assessment timetable.In February 2023  Pharming Group announced that the EMA's Committee for Human Medicinal Products (CHMP) decided to shift its assessment of the MAA for leniolisib to a standard review timetable. The list of questions received by Pharming from EMA included a request to submit updated data from the ongoing long-term extension study collected after the interim analysis included in the original MAA. We anticipate that the CHMP will issue its opinion on the leniolisib MAA in the second half of 2023 and expect European marketing authorisation approximately two months later.In the U.K. and in line with the European Commission Decision Reliance Procedure (ECDRP)  we intend to file the leniolisib dossier to the U.K.'s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) within five days of a positive CHMP opinion; expected in the second half of 2023.The U.K. government has extended the ECDRP until December 31  2023.JapanIn line with our strategy to expand the reach of our products to rare disease patients  on March 9  2023 we filed an Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) application with the Ministry of Health  Labor and Welfare (MHLW) in Japan. We expect to begin a clinical trial in Japan in second quarter of 2023 for APDS patients aged 12 and older. We currently anticipate marketing leniolisib in Japan directly following regulatory approval.Pediatric clinical developmentPharming has developed a clinical plan to include children as young as one year of age who are afflicted with APDS. During the first half of 2022  positive decisions were received from EMA and the U.K.'s MHRA on the Pediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) for leniolisib as a treatment for APDS in children younger than 12 years of age.In April 2022  the MHRA granted Promising Innovative Medicine (PIM) designation to leniolisib for the treatment of APDS. A PIM designation is an early indication that leniolisib is a candidate for the MHRA's Early Access to Medicines Scheme. This scheme provides an opportunity for treatment options to be used in clinical practice in parallel with the later stages of the regulatory process.The leniolisib PIP includes two planned global clinical trials in pediatric patients with APDS to support regulatory filings worldwide.In February 2023  Pharming announced that the first patient had been enrolled in its Phase III clinical trial evaluating leniolisib in children aged 4 to 11 with APDS at sites in the United States  Europe  and Japan.Leniolisib for additional indications (PI3KŒ¥ technology platform)As we continue to work towards regulatory approvals of leniolisib for APDS in the United States  Europe and the United Kingdom  we have also commenced working towards prioritizing other indications where leniolisib has the potential to deliver value for patients. PI3KŒ¥ has been identified as an important player in a variety of disease states  and leniolisib has demonstrated an attractive  long-term efficacy  safety and tolerability profile in clinical trials conducted in both healthy volunteers and patients. This provides a solid basis for our plans for the investigation and investment in further leniolisib indications Pre-Clinical PipelineOTL-105Pharming has an ongoing strategic collaboration with Orchard Therapeutics to research  develop  manufacture and commercialize OTL-105  a newly disclosed investigational ex vivo autologous hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene therapy for the treatment of hereditary angioedema (HAE). The program has made good progress developing the lentiviral vector to enhance C1-inhibitor expression and is now testing in preclinical HAE disease models. We anticipate providing further updates as we move towards preparing an Investigational New Drug (IND) filing.PompeWe are continuing the preclinical investigation of a next-generation alpha-glucosidase therapy for the treatment of Pompe disease  and are currently evaluating potential differentiating features of our product candidate in these preclinical studies. We expect to update the market on our findings in the second quarter of 2023.Discontinuation of non-rare disease assetsIn line with our strategic decision to focus on rare diseases  we announced at our half year financial results in August 2022 the discontinuation of development of recombinant human C1 esterase inhibitor (rhC1INH) for acute kidney injury (AKI) and pre-eclampsia (PE). In line with this decision  we also announce today that we have stopped further development in the large-scale production of rhC1INH through the use of our transgenic cattle herd program  and have stopped the ongoing Phase IIb clinical trial and we will no longer pursue other strategic options.RUCONEST¬Æ - marketed for the treatment of acute HAE attacksIn 2022  RUCONEST¬Æ returned to positive growth  achieving US$205.6 million in revenues and demonstrating the sustainability of our product for the treatment of acute HAE attacks  first commercialized in the United States in 2014.The United States accounted for the majority of worldwide revenues with US$200.1 million in 2022 compared to US$193.4 million in 2021. From the second quarter onward  we achieved quarter-on-quarter growth in the US market  both in volumes and revenues  reflecting the growing number of patients using RUCONEST¬Æ and physicians prescribing the medication.Revenues within Europe remained stable in spite of strong prophylactic and generic competition.While Pharming faces competition within the HAE market  the continued need for effective and reliable treatments for acute attacks  including breakthrough attacks in patients on prophylactic therapy  as well as RUCONEST¬Æ's distinct advantages as the only recombinant treatment that targets the root cause of HAE by replacing missing or dysfunctional C1-INH  allows for sustainability in RUCONEST¬Æ's revenues.Organizational highlightsPharming's headcount grew significantly in 2022. This growth was seen in commercial  medical and in back office support personnel in preparation for the launch and commercialization of leniolisib in key markets  most of which was in place at the tail end of the third quarter. Pharming will continue investing in its future by building the infrastructure to support the successful launch and commercialization of leniolisib and our other existing and future pipeline programs.Subsequent eventOn March 12 and 13  2023  Pharming issued three press releases regarding the events surrounding Silicon Valley Bank. Pharming confirms that it has full access to its deposits.Full Year 2022 Financial highlightsAmounts in US$m except per share data 2022 2021 % Change Income StatementRevenues 205.6 198.9 3 % Gross profit 188.1 177.7 6 % Operating profit 18.2 13.6 34 % Profit for the year 13.7 16.0 (14) % Balance SheetCash & marketable securities 208.7 193.0 8 % Share InformationBasic earnings per share (US$) 0.021 0.025 (16) % Diluted earnings per share (US$) 0.019 0.023 (17) %Financial ReviewIn 2022  Pharming's revenues increased by 3% to US$205.6 million and operating profit increased by 34% to US$18.2 million. Net profit decreased by 14% to US$13.7 million.This section will further elaborate on Pharming's financial performance in 2022.Revenues and Gross ProfitThe increase in revenues was primarily a result of higher sales of RUCONEST¬Æ in the U.S. market (US$200.1 million in 2022 compared to US$193.4 million in 2021)  which was supported by a price increase below CPI  as well as an increase in physicians prescribing and the number of patients using RUCONEST¬Æ.Revenues in Europe remained the same as last year at US$4.9 million in 2022. Revenue in the rest of the world  excluding Europe  increased to US$0.6 million from US$0.5 million in 2021.Cost of sales decreased by 17% from US$21.1 million in 2021 to US$17.6 million in 2022. Cost of sales related to product sales in 2022 amounted to US$17.4 million compared to US$19.1 million in 2021. The remainder of costs in 2022 (US$0.2 million) stem from impairment charges on inventory designated for commercial activities (2021: US$2.0 million).Gross profit increased by US$10.4 million  or 6%  to US$188.1 million for the year 2022. The main reasons for this increase were higher sales of RUCONEST¬Æ  a favorable currency translation effect and favorable production results.Operating Profit and Other Operating CostsFor 2022  the operating profit increased by US$4.6 million to US$18.2 million compared with US$13.6 million for the prior year. This increase was driven by increased gross profit (US$10.4 million) as mentioned above  increased other income (US$11.9 million) and offset by increased operating costs (US$17.6 million).Other income increased significantly by US$11.9 million in 2022 to US$14.5 million as compared to US$2.6 million in 2021 as Pharming reduced its minority stake in BioConnection from 43.85% to 22.98% in April 2022. As a result of this transaction  Pharming received one-off net cash proceeds of US$7.5 million and recognized a gain of US$12.2 million. This was partly offset by a decrease in government grants on R&D projects  due to Pharming's renewed strategy and pipeline.The operating costs for 2022 increased primarily from additional investments in leniolisib (development  medical affairs  commercial launch preparation). Furthermore  costs for the OTL-105 development increased and impairment costs were incurred from the discontinuation of the development of AKI and the cattle platform. Out of pocket costs of closed programs (Covid 19  PE  and AKI) were reduced versus the previous year.Financial income and expensesOther finance income decreased by US$10.4 million  to US$4.5 million for the year-end December 31  2022. This decrease was primarily caused by fluctuations in the U.S. Dollar versus Euro during 2021 and 2022. This had a particular impact on the bank balances due to our net cash position.During 2022  Pharming reduced its currency translation exposure causing the decrease of currency translation income in 2022 as compared to 2021.Other finance expenses decreased by US$0.7 million  from US$6.2 million for year-end December 31  2021 to US$5.5 million for the year ended December 31  2022  mainly caused by currency translation effects.The fair value loss on revaluation (US$1.2 million) relates to fair value adjustments in the BioConnection preference share which is included in Pharming's balance sheet as an investment in equity instruments designated at the Fair Value Through the Statement of Profit and Loss (FVTPL).Income tax expenseIncome tax expense decreased by US$5.8 million from US$7.1 million for the year ended December 31  2021 to US$1.3 million for the year ended December 31  2022  mainly due to the decrease in profit before tax and income from the BioConnection transaction  as mentioned above  being tax exempt.Profit for the yearA total net profit in 2022 of US$13.7 million represented a decrease of 14% over 2021 (US$16.0 million). The decrease was mainly caused by an increase in operating costs - due to company growth - investments in Pharming's product pipeline  decreasing foreign exchange gains and impairment charges on the cancelled downstream production facility. These increased costs were partly offset by an increase in revenues and other income.Intangible assetsIn 2022  intangible assets decreased by US$8.7 million from US$83.8 million in 2021 to US$75.1 million in 2022. The decrease was caused by regular amortization (US$4.3 million) and foreign currency effects (US$5.0 million)  and was partly offset by investments in assets (US$0.6 million).AmortizationThis relates to regular amortization of software and the re-acquired rights related to the acquisition of all North American commercialization rights from Bausch Health in 2016 and the acquisition of all European commercialization and distribution rights from Swedish Orphan International AB (""Sobi"") in 2020. Amortization is charged based on the economic lifetime of the intangible asset. The economic lifetime of the North American commercialization rights from Bausch Health is 20 years  where the economic lifetime of the European commercialization and distribution rights from Swedish Orphan International AB is 12 years. This estimate did not change compared to the previous year.InvestmentsInvestments in intangible assets relate to software. Assets acquired related to software (US$0.6 million) mainly relate to the improvements and updates to Pharming's ERP system SAP S/4HANA. The ERP system was implemented and operational as of January 1  2022 and amortized over five years  which is considered to be the expected economic lifetime.Property  plant and equipmentProperty  plant and equipment decreased from US$13.2 million for 2021 to US$10.4 million for 2022. The decrease was mainly caused by regular depreciation (US$2.6 million)  foreign currency effects US$0.7 million and impairments and divestment activities (US$0.9 million). These activities were related to assets designated to the development of rhC1INH therapy for Acute Kidney Injury  which was stopped.The decrease was partly offset by capital expenditures of US$1.4 million mainly relating to new machinery and equipment for Pharming's production process.Right-of-use assetsThe right-of-use assets increased by US$8.9 million to US$28.8 million for 2022 (2021: US$19.9 million). Investments of US$16.8 million in 2022  were primarily related to a new asset caused by the inception of the lease contract for the DSP facility at Pivot Park  Oss. As communicated in the prior year  as a result of our renewed strategic manufacturing partnership with long-term manufacturing partner Sanofi S.A.  Pharming decided to complete the construction of the new building  but will no longer pursue the realization of its own downstream production capacity at Pivot Park in Oss. During 2022 the lease commenced and resulted in an investment of US$14.6 million. Pharming is currently looking into possibilities for alternative use. As a result of aforementioned decision  the right-of-use asset was impaired for an amount of US$3.9 million. The remainder of the investments relate to investments in Pharming's lease car portfolio.The increase in the right-to-use assets are partly offset by regular depreciation (US$3.0 million) and foreign currency effects (US$0.8 million).InvestmentsInvestments increased by US$1.1 million to US$9.7 million at December 31  2022. This was caused by a decrease in investments accounted for using the equity method of US$4.7 million in 2022 from US$7.2 million at the end of the year in 2021  which resulted in a balance of US$2.5 million for the year ended December 31  2022. Next to this  a decrease was applicable in investments in debt instruments designated as at the Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income (FVTOCI) of US$1.0 million to US$0.4 million for the year ended December 31  2022 (2021: US$1.4 million). Finally  Pharming recognized a new investment in a debt instrument designated as at FVTPL (US$6.8 million).Investments accounted for using the equity methodThe asset relates to an investment in the ordinary shares of BioConnection Investments B.V.. During the second quarter of 2022  Pharming entered into a share purchase agreement  following receipt of an offer for all shares in BioConnection by Gimv  a European investment company listed on Euronext Brussels. The existing shareholders (including Pharming) reached an agreement with Gimv on the sale of all issued and outstanding shares to a new holding company (BioConnection Investments B.V.) incorporated by Gimv  followed by a partial re-investment by existing shareholders of the purchase price in the share capital of BioConnection Investments B.V. The re-investment relates to the purchase of ordinary shares and a preference share. The transaction diluted Pharming's stake in BioConnection from 43.85% in 2021 to 22.98% in 2022  which caused a decrease of US$3.0 millionAs a result of this transaction  Pharming received one-off net cash proceeds of US$7.5 million (EUR6.9 million) and recognized a gain of US$12.2 million.Furthermore  the remainder of the decrease was caused by the recognition of Pharming's share in the results of BioConnection and currency translation effects.Investment in debt instruments designated as at FVTPLThe asset relates to the preference share as obtained as part of the agreement referred to above relating to BioConnection Investments B.V. The fair value was calculated based on a commonly accepted valuation method  the option pricing model (""OPM""). As a result  Pharming recognized a fair value asset of US$7.9 million at inception date in Q2 2022. Management reassessed the fair value at December 31  2022  resulting in a decrease of the fair value of US$1.2 million.InventoriesInventories increased from US$27.3 million for the year ended December 31  2021 to US$42.3 million for the year ended December 31  2022. This was largely due to an increase in work in progress inventory.Cash and cash equivalentsCash and cash equivalents  together with restricted cash  increased to US$208.7 million at the year-end 2022  compared with US$193.0 million for the year ended December 31  2021. This was a result of positive cash flows from operating activities of US$22.9 million and positive cash flows generated from investing activities of US$5.3 million. This was offset by net cash flows used in financing activities of US$5.0 million and currency translation effect of US$7.8 million.EquityThe equity position increased by US$11.7 million from US$192.9 million for the year ended December 31  2021 to US$204.6 million for the year ended December 31  2022. This was mainly due to the changes in the net result achieved by Pharming (US$13.7 million) and transactions recognized directly in equity relating to share based compensation and exercised options (US$8.7 million)  and was partly offset by other comprehensive income relating to the currency translation reserve of US$10.4 million and fair value changes on investments designated as fair value with changes through other comprehensive income (US$0.7 million).Convertible bondThe convertible bond has decreased by US$7.5 million to US$133.4 million at year-end 2022  moving from US$140.9 million as of December 31  2021. This was mainly caused by foreign currency effects of US$8.3 million  which was partly offset by amortization of transactions costs (US$0.8 million). During 2022  a total of US$4.0 million of interest was paid on the bond.Lease liabilitiesLease liabilities increased by US$12.4 million from US$20.9 million as of 2021 to US$33.3 million per December 31  2022. The increase (US$16.2 million) was mainly due to new lease contracts for our DSP facility at Pivot Park  Oss in the Netherlands  inflation increases on lease prices for other facilities  and additions to the liability due to expansion of Pharming's car fleet. This was partly offset by monthly or quarterly lease payments (US$3.3 million). The remainder relates to regularly accrued interest expenses and foreign exchange effects.Outlook/SummaryFor 2023  the Company anticipates:Continued low single digit growth in annual revenues from RUCONEST¬Æ  with quarterly fluctuations expected.Subject to FDA approval in the U.S. for leniolisib  we plan to commercially launch leniolisib in 2Q 2023.We anticipate a positive CHMP opinion for leniolisib in 2H 2023.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE‚ÄôS STATEMENT I joined BenevolentAI as Chief Executive Officer nearly five years ago with a mission to align emerging technologies with science in a bold new way. Today  our ground-breaking AI platform is helping to drive a transformation in drug discovery by empowering scientists to uncover novel targets across many therapeutic areas for different modalities. Our progress in 2022 has solidified our leadership in the sector as we continued to advance our in-house pipeline and enhance our AI drug discovery platform  the Benevolent Platform‚Ñ¢. Commercially  we delivered solid performance in our highly productive collaboration with AstraZeneca  an important revenue driver for the Company  which provides strong scientific and commercial validation of our approach. During the period  AstraZeneca selected three additional novel targets for its portfolio  bringing the total to five novel targets selected to date  and extended the collaboration agreement for a further three years and in two new disease areas. This expansion of our collaboration led to a significant cash investment by AstraZeneca into the business as part of the Business Combination. Discovery and development portfolio At BenevolentAI  our AI platform enables scientists to unravel the biological mechanisms underlying complex multifactorial diseases. Using our platform  we have generated a portfolio of 15 named drug programmes and more than ten exploratory programmes  representing a healthy balance of potentially first-in-class and best-in-class assets. This includes BEN-2293  which we are currently progressing through a Phase Ib/IIa clinical study as a treatment for mild and moderate atopic dermatitis  with results expected in the first quarter of 2023. We filed a clinical trial application (CTA) in 2022 for our next most advanced programme  BEN-8744  for ulcerative colitis  with the objective to complete the Phase I clinical study by H1 2024 before initiating a Phase II study. Whilst the Benevolent Platform‚Ñ¢ is disease-agnostic  with the unique ability to rapidly identify novel targets in any disease area  going forward  we will focus our internal development pipeline on three core strategic areas: immunology  neurology and oncology  as announced in September 2022. We look to co-develop or out-license the programmes that are outside these therapy areas. Product and technology Throughout the year  we delivered performance enhancements to our world-leading AI drug discovery platform. We enhanced our data foundations by launching our next-generation Knowledge Graph  which is powered by advanced natural language processing (NLP) to enable more precise target predictions. We also substantially improved our suite of target identification tools  allowing scientists to discover targets best prosecuted via alternative modalities  and introduced sophisticated large language models (LLM) to predict novel therapeutic drug targets from scientific literature. Finally  we improved R&D decisions by launching a powerful new tool that enables scientists to make target progressibility assessments based on factors like druggability  selectivity and competitor and patent landscapes. These improvements to our transformative  scalable technology infrastructure have played a pivotal role in delivering key milestones in 2022 through our in-house pipeline and our successful collaboration with AstraZeneca. Nurturing continuous innovation Innovation is at the centre of everything we do  and 2022 reinforced our commitment to creating the conditions for innovation to flourish at BenevolentAI. Building on the legacy of our monthly ‚ÄòChallenge Days‚Äô ‚Äì set up during the pandemic ‚Äì we brought our entire team together for Innovation Week 2022 hosted at our London headquarters for an intensive five days of cross-functional collaboration  which resulted in significant product enhancements  new development projects and enriched team cohesion. Our collaborations with academic innovators further multiply our opportunities for impact. In the first half of 2022  we initiated phase two of our AI research partnership with the Stanford University-based Helix Group  which focuses on discovering more effective methods to extract knowledge from biological and clinical information. Our innovation pipeline feeds into our intellectual property portfolio  including 91 tech-related applications and 122 drug discovery patent applications  representing an important strategic asset for BenevolentAI. Impact BenevolentAI is a purposeful company  and we believe it is important to amplify the impact of our platform and put our technology to good use for wider societal benefit. While our core strategy is to discover novel targets and develop better treatments through our in-house pipeline and partnerships  our non-commercial deployments compliment this core mission in the interest of the global good. One of the most visible applications of our approach was in support of the global campaign against COVID-19. This year we received further validation of the results of AI-enabled research  Baricitinib  the drug identified by BenevolentAI as a treatment for COVID-19 in January 2020  was fully approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Baricitinib has been a mainstay of treatment in hospitals globally since being approved for emergency use by the FDA in November 2020  and its success in saving the lives of critically ill COVID-19 patients is a testament to the power of our platform and its potential to enhance and accelerate life-saving research. Further underscoring our commitment to using our platform for broader societal benefit  we signed a new not-for-profit partnership with the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi) in 2022. The partnership aims to identify targets and approved drugs that could be used to treat dengue fever  a climate-sensitive neglected disease representing one of the top ten threats to global public health worldwide. Outlook Completing our business combination and successfully listing on Euronext Amsterdam in April 2022 was a testament to the strength of our business and growth story. As a result  we closed 2022 in a strong financial position  with a cash runway to Q4 2024 and sufficient capital to support our pipeline and strategy to drive long-term value creation. We have several value inflection points both in the near and medium term. We expect top-line results of the Phase IIa clinical study for BEN-2293 in Q1 2023  and subject to results we will focus on out-licensing of BEN-2293 for atopic dermatitis post-Phase IIa data and initiate a Phase I study for BEN-8744 for ulcerative colitis in H1 2023. We also plan on delivering one to two CTA or IND-stage drug candidates. We expect to commence IND-enabling studies for at least one additional asset whilst transitioning three projects into lead optimisation  initiating four new drug discovery programmes. We also aim at signing an additional collaboration in the year ahead. 2023 has the potential to be a breakthrough year for BenevolentAI. With the world‚Äôs attention on AI applications that deliver real-world impact  we are strongly positioned to capitalise on this moment. With our substantial portfolio of platform-generated drugs  our work with big pharma and research collaborators  and our continued investment in state-of-the-art technology  we are showing every day how AI can be used to unlock the next wave of biopharma innovation. We believe our leading platform will empower scientists to uncover novel treatments faster and with a higher probability of clinical success. Ultimately  our ambition is to facilitate the scaled development of new  more effective treatments for the patients who need them. I am confident in our ability to deliver on this mission. Joanna Shields Chief Executive Officer FINANCIAL REVIEW We have delivered a strong operational performance  achieving the majority of our strategic objectives within budget and ending the year with cash at the top end of our stated guidance. With the business combination completed (notes 2.4 and 4 of the financial statements) and the Company listed on Euronext Amsterdam in April 2022  we are in a strong position to deliver on our stated objectives and to create shareholder value. In 2023 we look forward to the results of BEN-2293 within atopic dermatitis and the upcoming Phase I study of BEN-8744 in ulcerative colitis while also continuing to drive progress across our broader development pipeline. We will also continue to invest and drive innovation across our Product & Technology stack in a targeted manner to retain our differentiated position. Against a macroeconomic backdrop of rising inflation and increasing financial pressures  we have reviewed and refined our spend profile to keep to our stated cash runway target of Q4 2024 whilst still delivering on the predefined objectives as at our interim results. Revenues At BenevolentAI  we aim to monetise our platform through commercial collaborations and through developing our pipeline of wholly-owned assets with the aim of out-licensing  co-developing/co-commercialising or  potentially  eventually  commercialising in-house. The Group‚Äôs revenues increased by ¬£6.0 million to ¬£10.6 million (2021: ¬£4.6 million)  primarily reflecting increased revenues from the AstraZeneca collaboration and the majority of this increase reflecting a second AI-enabled drug discovery collaboration that started in January 2022  combined with revenue from a one-year extension to the initial collaboration that began in late 2021. We also recognised three milestone payments in 2022 as AstraZeneca selected three additional novel targets in chronic kidney disease (one target) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (two targets). Alternative performance measures and normalised presentation The normalised presentation of the Group performance can be found in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income and explained further in note 2.4 of the financial statements. Research and development (R&D) expenses The Group‚Äôs investment in R&D is vital to its long-term growth strategy. Our spend can be split across two verticals: 1) Product & Technology  which helps scientists understand complex biology  predict targets and help design and develop drugs for disease and 2) Drug Discovery  where our team of scientists then use our technology stack to pick novel targets for disease before developing drugs for these targets. The output of this symbiotic relationship is in the form of collaborations  such as with AstraZeneca and our pipeline of now 15 named programmes. The normalised presentation of the Group performance can be found in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income and explained further in note 2.4 of the financial statements. Normalised product and technology spend  excluding share-based payments  for 2022 increased to ¬£21.9 million (2021: ¬£20.0 million) due to increased staff-related costs to support the continued expansion of the Benevolent Platform‚Ñ¢. Reported product and technology spend in 2022 decreased to ¬£24.3 million from ¬£25.1 million in 2021 reflecting lower share-based payment expenses. Normalised drug discovery spend  excluding share-based payments  for 2022 increased to ¬£43.2 million (2021: ¬£27.1 million). Reported drug discovery spend for 2022 increased to ¬£47.6 million (2021: ¬£31.8 million). The normalised increase was driven by advancing the BenevolentAI pipeline into later stages of development  particularly BEN-2293 and its progression through an adaptive Phase I/II clinical study  alongside BEN-8744 CTA filing enablement in December 2022. We also added a net 4 named programmes into our pipeline during the year. General and administrative costs With the business listing in 2022  we have made targeted investments in our operational structures to support our status as a listed business  particularly across finance  compliance  legal and risk activities. The Group continues to make material investments in building and protecting its IP portfolio (consisting of patents  trade secrets  copyright and trademarks). Finally  post-year end  we have also increased investment in our business development capabilities as our pipeline matures and reaches key value inflection points. Normalised business operations spend  excluding employee-related share-based payments  for 2022 has increased to ¬£16.5 million (2021: ¬£13.9 million). Reported business operations spend  excluding employee-related share-based payments  for 2022 has increased to ¬£115.0 million from ¬£27.6 million in 2021. The normalised increase reflects those additional costs related to listing readiness and operating as a public company highlighted above. These costs are expected to stay at these levels given the enhanced level of compliance and reporting obligations and previously discussed investments. Share-based payments (SBPs) Normalised SBP spend for 2022 has decreased to ¬£23.7 million (2021: ¬£51.4 million). Reported SBP spend for 2022 has decreased to ¬£27.6 million (2021: ¬£51.4 million). The normalised change is predominantly driven by the recognition of vested options under the legacy BEIS share incentive scheme for 2022 of ¬£22.4 million (2021: ¬£51.4 million). This includes a ¬£6.5 million credit in relation to employer-related taxes in 2022 (2021: ¬£12.4 million charge on initial recognition). In 2022  the Group initiated a new LTIP for which a ¬£1.3 million charge has been recognised and which is expected to incur an ongoing SBP charge  inclusive of employer-related taxes  of between ¬£6.2 million and ¬£9.0 million based upon the share price as at the end of December. The fair value charging methodology for the legacy BEIS plan has been re-assessed to reflect a now-known ‚Äúpoint of exit‚Äù and a graded vesting profile. This correction has resulted in an additional ¬£21.2 million SBP charge and restatement to 2021 profit and loss  with a corresponding credit to the share-based payment reserve and employer-related tax provision on 31 December 2021. Operating loss Normalised operating loss for 2022 decreased to ¬£94.6 million (2021: ¬£107.7 million). The reported operating loss for 2022 increased to ¬£197.0 million (2021: ¬£121.3 million) primarily due to the costs arising from the business combination  which are not expected to continue in 2023. Finance income Finance income for 2022 has increased to ¬£19.3 million (2021: ¬£56 000). This is predominantly driven by the fair value revaluation of the warrant liabilities acquired through the Transaction  reflecting an increase in their value as of 31 December 2022 compared to the Transaction date of ¬£17.7m. Taxation Taxation income for 2022 has increased to ¬£15.9 million (2021: ¬£14.1 million). This is predominantly composed of tax credits arising from the UK‚Äôs small and medium-sized enterprises' R&D tax relief regime  for which there has been increase in the claim between the two periods  driven by an increase in eligible R&D expenditure. Loss per share Normalised basic loss per share has decreased to 72.6 pence for 2022 (2021: 104.6 pence)  with the weighted average number of shares in both periods adjusted to reflect the exchange ratio of the share for share exchange completed during the Transaction  such as to reflect the capital structure of the legal parent. The increase reflects the decrease in normalised total loss. Current assets Current assets as of 31 December 2022 have increased to ¬£152.1 million (31 December 2021: ¬£56.6 million)  largely driven by an ¬£89.6 million increase in cash  cash equivalents and short-term deposits. Cash  cash equivalents and short-term deposits The cash position  including short-term deposits position as of 31 December 2022 has materially strengthened to ¬£130.2 million (31 December 2021: ¬£40.6 million). The PIPE drives this increase  backstop proceeds  Odyssey Acquisition acquired cash  with gross proceeds of ¬£186.8 million (‚Ç¨225 million) and AstraZeneca collaboration proceeds  offset by the settlement of Transaction expenses and ordinary course working capital expenditure. Warrants Warrants as of 31 December 2022 have decreased to ¬£0.4 million post transaction close (31 December 2021: ¬£nil)  part of the net assets acquired through the Transaction and revalued at the end of the reporting period. Other current liabilities Other current liabilities as of 31 December 2022 have increased to ¬£25.3 million (31 December 2021: ¬£23.0 million)  reflecting an increase in trade payables for R&D-related expenses as part of the Group‚Äôs core activities and an increase in deferred income under the AstraZeneca agreements. Normalised cash flow Cash expended from operating activities before taxation and Transaction-related items have increased to ¬£77.8 million for 2022 (2021: ¬£60.1 million)  primarily driven by normalised operating losses of ¬£94.6 million. Dividend No dividend has been proposed for the year ended 31 December 2022 (2021: nil) Accounting policies The Group‚Äôs consolidated financial information has been prepared in accordance with international accounting standards  as applicable to the EU  in conformity with the requirements of Luxembourg law. The accounting policies used in the consolidated financial information are consistent with those in the audited financial statements. Going concern After making enquiries and/or producing cash flow forecasts  the Directors have reasonable expectations  as at the date of approving the financial statements  that the Group will have adequate resources to fund activities for at least twelve months from the date of the approval of the financial statements. Although the business continued to make losses throughout the year to 31 December 2022  the Company and Group have sufficient funds  contracted revenue and expected R&D tax receipts to support a cash runway to Q4 2024. This is further discussed in the financial statements. Outlook Subject to the top-line results of our BEN-2293 asset in an adaptive Phase I/II clinical study (expected in Q1 2023)  we aim to out-license this asset in the second half of 2023. In addition  we also aim to sign an additional commercial collaboration in 2023. We anticipate that this additional capital will extend our cash runway beyond the guided Q4 2024 runway  which excludes revenues from unsigned out-licensing or collaboration agreements. In 2023  prioritisation of clinical programme spend will support our asset BEN-8744  which will enter a Phase I study in the first half of 2023. We will also invest in BEN-28010 with the aim of filing a CTA in H2 2023 for GBM  advance assets within our broader pipeline and bring new named drug programmes into the pipeline. The Company will continue to invest in the Benevolent Platform‚Ñ¢ to increase the understanding of underlying disease biology  power the development of our in-house pipeline  and support collaborations. Principal risks facing the business BenevolentAI operates an embedded risk management framework  which is monitored and reviewed by the Board. There are a number of potential risks and uncertainties that could have a material impact on the Group‚Äôs financial performance and position. These include risks relating to the development of our drug portfolio and ability to out-license  the commercialisation of our technologies through collaboration  the biotech funding environment  the political environment  competitive threat  supply chain disruption  legal and regulatory  IT systems and infrastructure  cyber and data security  foreign exchange  people  COVID-19  strategic acquisitions  and the environment and climate change. These risks and the Group‚Äôs mitigating actions are set out within the Annual Report 2022.

UNAUDITED NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL INFORMATION 1 Background to the Group 1.1 Corporate information BenevolentAI (the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù)  which is a Soci√©t√© Anonyme  is a publicly listed company on the Euronext Amsterdam  with the ticker symbol BAI. The Company is limited by shares  incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg under registered number B255412  having its registered office 9  rue de Bitbourg  L-273 Luxembourg  Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. The principal activity of the Company and its subsidiaries (collectively  the ‚ÄúGroup‚Äù or ‚ÄúBAI Group‚Äù) is that of creating and applying AI and machine learning to transform the way medicines are discovered and developed. 1.2 Group structure BenevolentAI was originally known as Odyssey Acquisition S.A. (‚ÄúOdyssey‚Äù)  a Special Purpose Acquisition Company established for the purpose of acquiring a business with principal business operations in Europe or in another geographic area  that is based in the healthcare sector or the TMT (technology  media  telecom) sector or any other sectors. Odyssey was listed on the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange on 6 July 2021. On 22 April 2022 (‚ÄúClosing date‚Äù)  Odyssey and BenevolentAI Limited (‚ÄúBAI Ltd‚Äù)  the former parent company of the privately held UK group before the capital reorganisation (‚ÄúTransaction‚Äù)  entered into a capital reorganisation agreement by way of contribution of all shares in BAI Ltd into Odyssey in exchange for Odyssey issuing new ordinary shares. The Transaction was completed on 22 April 2022 and the name of the ultimate holding company was changed from Odyssey Acquisition S.A. to BenevolentAI  whose consolidated Group post-Transaction is referred to as BAI Group. BAI Group is managed by its ultimate parent company BenevolentAI  with the following 5 trading subsidiaries operating under one segment. The Group‚Äôs opportunity to deliver future value depends on a unified and amalgamated approach across the whole of the Group and could not be achieved independently by any individual entity or separately identifiable line of business.

They have been prepared on a historical cost basis  except for financial instruments measured at fair value  and all amounts have been rounded to the nearest ¬£‚Äò000. As set out in note 2.2 below  the Group financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The accounting policies set out below have  unless otherwise stated  been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial statements. Judgements made by the directors in the application of these accounting policies that have significant effect on the financial statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year are discussed in note 3. No new standards have been early adopted by the Group in the year. A number of new standards are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023 and earlier application is permitted; however  the Group has not early adopted the new or amended standards in preparing these consolidated financial statements. The following new and amended standards are not expected to have a significant impact on the Group‚Äôs consolidated financial statements. IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts (issued on 18 May 2017; including Amendments to IFRS 17) and Initial Application of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 Comparative information (issued after 25 June 2021) Amendments to IAS 8 Accounting policies  Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors: Definition of Accounting Estimates (issued on 12 February 2021) Amendments to IFRS 16 Leases on sale and leaseback: These amendments include requirements for sale and leaseback transactions in IFRS 16 to explain how an entity accounts for a sale and leaseback after the date of the transaction (issued on 22 September 2022) Amendments to IAS 1  Non-current liabilities with covenants: These amendments clarify how conditions with which an entity must comply within twelve months after the reporting period affect the classification of a liability (issued on 31 October 2022) Amendments to IAS 1  aim to improve accounting policy disclosures and to help users of the financial statements to distinguish between changes in accounting estimates and changes in accounting policies. Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes: Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction (issued on 7 May 2021) 2.2 Going concern The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis  which the Directors consider appropriate for the following reasons. Cash flow forecasts have been prepared for a period in excess of 12 months from the date of approval of these financial statements (the going concern period). These forecasts include a base case scenario  which excludes any unsigned revenue contracts. Additionally  severe but plausible downside scenarios have also been considered  with corresponding mitigating actions that allow for an extension of the Group's cash runway. The Group‚Äôs cash  cash equivalents and short-term deposits position of ¬£130.2m (2021: ¬£40.6m) comes largely from issuing equity  most recently from the business combination completed in April 2022 (see note 4) and related equity PIPE investment. The base case scenario includes a substantial cash position held by the Group and excludes unsigned revenue which could be secured as part of normal operating activities. The severe but plausible scenario downside scenarios consider the Group‚Äôs exposure to macroeconomic factors  including inflation  tax credit regime changes and supply chain risk. No combination of these factors indicates that additional funding will be needed throughout the going concern period  due to various mitigating actions that the Directors could implement to preserve cash if needed. These mitigating actions include a reduction in operating expenses (which are within the control of the Directors). These forecasts indicate that the Group will have sufficient funds to meet its liabilities for the going concern period. The Group continues to rely on equity to fund its operations in the medium to long term. The Directors remain confident that  when it is required  such further funding will be accessible to the Group. As a result  the Directors are confident that the Group will have sufficient funds to continue to meet its liabilities as they fall due for at least 12 months from the date of approval of these financial statements and have therefore prepared the financial statements on a going concern basis. 2.3 Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to  or has rights to  variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. In assessing control  the Group takes into consideration potential voting rights that are currently exercisable. The acquisition date is the date on which control is transferred to the acquirer. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases. Losses applicable to the non-controlling interests in a subsidiary are allocated to the non-controlling interests even if doing so causes the non-controlling interests to have a deficit balance. Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intra-group balances and transactions  and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions  are eliminated. 2.4 Normalised operating loss and cash flows Normalised operating loss for the years ended 31 December 2022 and 31 December 2021 is defined as operating loss excluding non-normalised transactions  defined as those related to the business combination; the impairment of assets or revaluation of investments for which BAI does manage directly; and the revaluation of the warrants recognised as finance income. This is to show an underlying representation of operating losses for the respective periods and extends to normalised operating cash flows on the same basis. Normalised operating losses  normalised operating cash flows and non-normalised transactions are each alternative performance measures (‚ÄúAPMs‚Äù) that are not calculated in accordance with IFRS and  therefore  may not be directly comparable with other companies‚Äô APMs  including those in the Group‚Äôs industry. APMs should be considered in addition to  and are not intended to substitute or supersede  IFRS measures. This APM is in our view an important metric for a biotech company in the development stage. Removing the non-normalised costs  given their material  isolated and one-off nature  enables users to better compare the Group‚Äôs normal operating performance between reporting periods. The following table presents a reconciliation of normalised operating loss  to the closest IFRS measures  for the year ended 31 December: Note 2022 ¬£'000 2021 restated ¬£'000 Operating loss (197 034) (121 322) Adjustments for: Transaction-related expenditure 11 255 2 911 Transaction-related listing service SBP expense 4 83 067 - Transaction-related employee-related SBP expenses 28 3 883 - Impairment of assets 15 - 10 700 Transaction-related stamp duty 3 740 - Revaluation of investments 17 491 - Total non-normalised operating charges 102 436 13 611 Normalised operating loss (94 598) (107 711) Similarly  normalised operating cash flows are considered on the same basis and to the same effect. The following table presents a reconciliation to the closest IFRS measures for the year ended 31 December: Note 2022 ¬£'000 2021 restated ¬£'000 Cash flows from operating activities Operating loss for the year (197 034) (121 322) Non-normalised expenses 2.4 102 436 13 611 Normalised operating loss 2.4 (94 598) (107 711) Adjustments for: Depreciation charges 16  18 3 053 2 931 Amortisation charges 15 3 12 Loss on disposal of property  plant and equipment 2 27 Foreign exchange (gain)/loss (3 141) 6 Other employee-related SBP expense 28 29 935 39 016 Normalised operating cash flow before changes in working capital (64 746) (65 719) Increase in trade and other receivables (1 460) (656) Increase in R&D tax credit receivable (3 969) (1 472) Decrease in trade and other payables (1 505) (4 830) (Decrease)/increase in provisions (6 160) 12 625 Cash expended from operating activities before taxation and non-normalised items (77 840) (60 052) Cash outflows in respect of Transaction-related expenditure 2.4 (11 255) (2 911) Cash outflows in respect of Transaction-related stamp duty 2.4 (3 740) - Cash expended from operating activities before taxation (92 835) (62 963) Taxation 15 924 14 059 Net cash outflow from operating activities (76 911) (48 904) 2.5 Change in functional currency of BenevolentAI As of 22 April 2022  management reviewed the functional currency of BenevolentAI and the presentation currency of the Group. The change in functional currency for standalone BenevolentAI was made  from euros (‚ÄúEUR‚Äù) to pound sterling (‚ÄúGBP‚Äù) to reflect that GBP has become the predominant operating currency for the Company representing a significant part of its cash flows and its operating environment  while the Group presentation currency remains in GBP consistent with the prior year. The Group presents as comparative information the financial information of the former BenevolentAI Limited Group  which had GBP as its functional and presentation currency. That is  as discussed in note 2.14  the new Group‚Äôs consolidated statement of comprehensive income contains only the post-acquisition performance of BenevolentAI. Comparative information  therefore  has not been re-stated following this change to BenevolentAI‚Äôs functional currency. 2.6 Foreign currency Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of Group entities at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are retranslated to the functional currency at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined. The assets and liabilities of foreign operations  including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation  are translated to the Group‚Äôs presentational currency  GBP  at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated at an average rate for the year where this rate approximates to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions. Exchange differences arising from this translation of foreign operations are reported as an item of other comprehensive income and accumulated in the translation reserve. When a foreign operation is disposed of  such that control  or significant influence (as the case may be) is lost  the entire accumulated amount in the foreign currency translation reserve  is recycled to profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal. 2.7 Classification of financial instruments issued by the Company Following the adoption of IAS 32  financial instruments issued by the Company are treated as equity only to the extent that they meet the following two conditions: (a) they include no contractual obligations upon the Company to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Company; and (b) where the instrument will or may be settled in the Company‚Äôs own equity instruments  it is either a non-derivative that includes no obligation to deliver a variable number of the Company‚Äôs own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the Company‚Äôs exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments. To the extent that this definition is not met  the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability. Where the instrument so classified takes the legal form of the Company‚Äôs own shares  the amounts presented in these consolidated financial statements for called up share capital and share premium account exclude amounts in relation to those shares. 2.8 Non-derivative financial instruments Non-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in equity  trade and other receivables  cash and cash equivalents  and trade and other payables. Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method  less any expected credit losses (‚ÄúECLs‚Äù). Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash balances and cash deposits with maturities of less than 3 months at their inception Short-term deposits Short-term deposits include cash deposits with maturities of greater than 3 months but less than 12 months at their inception. Investments Investments are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to the initial recognition they are measured at fair value through profit or loss using latest observable share price. 2.9 Derivative financial instruments Warrants As part of the Business Combination transaction  BAI Group took on warrants which had been initially issued by Odyssey prior to the Transaction  as part of financing Odyssey‚Äôs working capital and investment. A derivative  other than a derivative that meets the definition of an equity instrument  is initially recognised as a financial asset or financial liability at its fair value on the date the derivative contract is entered into  and the related transaction costs are expensed. The fair values of the derivatives are remeasured at the end of each reporting period with changes in fair values recognised through profit or loss. A derivative that will be settled by the Company delivering a fixed number of its own equity instruments in exchange for a fixed amount of cash in terms of its functional currency or another financial asset is classified and presented as an equity instrument  rather than a financial liability. As the exercise price of the Company‚Äôs share purchase warrants that are exercisable into common shares is denominated in EUR  however  the Company will receive a variable amount of cash in terms of its GBP functional currency upon exercise of the warrants due to movements in foreign exchange. The warrants are  therefore  presented as derivative financial liabilities. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation of the EUR denominated warrants are recognised as finance income/expense in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. 2.10 Intangible assets Goodwill Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to a single identifiable cash-generating unit and is not amortised but instead tested annually for impairment. Research and development Expenditure on research activities is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as an expense as incurred. Expenditure on development activities is capitalised if the product or process is technically and commercially feasible and the Group intends and has the technical ability and sufficient resources to complete development  future economic benefits are probable and if the Group can measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development. Development activities involve a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products or processes. The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials  direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads and capitalised borrowing costs. Other development expenditure is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as an expense as incurred. Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and less accumulated impairment losses. Other Intangible assets Expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as an expense as incurred. Patents or rights to their future income acquired by the Company are initially recognised based on transaction price and stated at this cost less accumulated amortisation. Indicators of impairment are assessed at the end of each reporting period. Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Company are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and less accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation Amortisation is recognised as an administrative expense in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets  starting from the date they are available for use. The estimated useful life and amortisation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period  with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis. The estimated useful lives are as follows: Patents or rights to their future income ‚Äì over the expected duration of the patent Software - length of software licence Goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are not amortised but are systematically tested for impairment annually. 2.11 Property  plant and equipment Property  plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Where parts of an item of property  plant and equipment have different useful lives  they are accounted for as separate items of property  plant and equipment. Depreciation is charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income under either the administrative expense or R&D expense  depending on the classification of the asset  on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of tangible fixed assets. Leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives. The estimated useful lives are as follows: laboratory equipment 4 - 10 years computer equipment 3 years fixtures and fittings 4 - 5 years leasehold improvements life of the lease Depreciation methods  useful lives and residual values are reviewed if there is an indication of a significant change since last annual reporting date in the pattern by which the Company expects to consume an asset‚Äôs future economic benefits. 2.12 Right-of-use assets A right-of-use asset is recognised at the commencement date of a lease. The right-of-use asset is measured at cost  which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability  adjusted for  as applicable  any lease payments made at or before the commencement date net of any lease incentives received  any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs expected to be incurred for dismantling and removing the underlying asset  and restoring the site or asset. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the unexpired period of the lease or the estimated useful life of the asset  whichever is the shorter. Where the Company expects to obtain ownership of the leased asset at the end of the lease term  the depreciation is over its estimated useful life. Right-of-use assets are subject to impairment or adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The Company has elected not to recognise a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability for short-term leases with terms of 12 months or less and leases of low-value assets. Lease payments on these assets are expensed to profit or loss as incurred. 2.13 Business combinations Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date  which is the date on which control is transferred to the Group. The Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as: the fair value of the consideration transferred; plus the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree; plus the fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree; less the net recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. If the contingent consideration is classified as equity  it is not remeasured  and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise  subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss. 2.14 Capital reorganisation The business combination between BAI Ltd and Odyssey is accounted for within the scope of IFRS 2 as a capital reorganisation since Odyssey did not meet the definition of a business in accordance with IFRS 3. Under this accounting method  Odyssey is treated as the acquired company for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly  for financial reporting purposes  the Transaction was treated as the equivalent of BAI Ltd issuing shares at the closing of the Business Combination for the net assets of Odyssey as at the Closing date. The capital reorganisation reflects the transition of the share capital and share premium from BAI Ltd to BenevolentAI  which comprises the legal essence of the Transaction. This results in a decrease within share capital and related increase to share premium  to align the equity of BAI Ltd (as the acquirer for financial reporting purposes) with the equity of the Group‚Äôs new ultimate legal parent  BenevolentAI. The book value accounted for on consolidation is reflected through a corresponding charge to merger difference  such that the net impact to equity is equal to the net assets acquired (¬£5.2m  see note 4). The excess of the fair value of consideration for Odyssey over the fair value of its identifiable net assets acquired represents a compensation for the service of a stock exchange listing for its shares and expenses as incurred. The comparatives in the financial statements represent the financial information of BAI Ltd and its subsidiaries  both to 31 December 2021 and as at 31 December 2021. The activity and position of the acquired Odyssey is considered only from the Closing date onwards. That is  the consolidated statement of comprehensive income contains only the post-acquisition performance of BenevolentAI. See note 4 for further details. 2.15 Impairment Financial assets (including receivables) Financial assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at the end of the reporting period. The Group recognises an allowance for expected credit losses (‚ÄúECLs"") for all debt instruments not held at fair value through profit or loss. ECLs are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the company expects to receive  discounted at an approximation of the original effective interest rate. For credit exposures for which there has not been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition  ECLs are provided for credit losses that result from default events that are possible within the next twelve months. For those credit exposures for which there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition  a loss allowance is required for credit losses expected over the remaining life of the exposure  irrespective of the timing of the default. Non-financial assets The carrying amounts of the Company‚Äôs non-financial assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists  then the asset‚Äôs recoverable amount is estimated. The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit (‚ÄúCGU‚Äù) is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. In assessing the fair value of the CGU  we have considered quoted market prices in an active market  as we consider the Group as a single CGU. For the purpose of impairment testing  assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or groups of assets (the CGU). An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss. Impairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units  and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the unit (group of units) on a pro rata basis. An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets  impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset‚Äôs carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined  net of depreciation or amortisation  if no impairment loss had been recognised. 2.16 Employee benefits Defined contribution plans A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which the Company pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in the periods during which services are rendered by employees. Share-based payment transactions ‚Äì BenevolentAI Equity Incentive Scheme (‚ÄúBEIS‚Äù) Share-based payment arrangements in which the Group receives goods or services as consideration for its own equity instruments are accounted for as equity-settled share-based payment transactions  regardless of how the equity instruments are obtained by the Group. Options or restricted stock units (‚ÄúRSUs‚Äù) granted under the BEIS are comprised of tranches that represent each increment that participants become entitled to over the vesting period. The fair value of each of these vesting tranches is recognised as an employee or related expense in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income  on a straight-line basis over the longer of either the time until the service condition is met or the trigger event is expected to take place (‚Äúvesting period‚Äù)  with a corresponding movement to equity reserves. For each tranche continuing to have their FV charged after the trigger event  this is spread on a straight line basis over the service period. The fair value of the awards granted is measured using the Black-Scholes model. The amount to be expensed over the vesting period is adjusted to reflect the number of awards for which the related non-market vesting conditions are expected to be met  such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the number of awards that meet the related non-market performance conditions at the vesting date. At each consolidated statement of financial position date  the Group revises its estimates of the number of awards that are expected to vest  as well as the estimate of the vesting period. The impact of the revisions of original estimates  if any  is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income  with a corresponding adjustment to equity reserves  over the remaining vesting period. Share-based payment transactions ‚Äì Long Term Incentive Plan (‚ÄúLTIP‚Äù) Awards granted to participants under the LTIP comprise of RSUs and performance stock units (‚ÄúPSUs‚Äù). The fair value for the RSUs has been determined and recognised on the same basis as under the BEIS post trigger event  namely tied to the service condition. The PSUs include both non-market vesting conditions and market vesting conditions. As with the BEIS  the number of equity instruments expected to vest which are tied to the non-market conditions is revisited at each balance sheet date so that  ultimately  the cumulative amount recognised over the vesting period is based on the number of instruments that eventually vest. Market vesting conditions  however  are factored into the fair value of the awards granted. The portion of each PSU which relates to market vesting conditions carries a separate fair value  determined using the Monte Carlo Simulation model. Provided all other vesting conditions are satisfied  a charge is made irrespective of whether the market vesting conditions are satisfied. The cumulative expense is not adjusted for failure to achieve a market vesting condition. Tax payments related to share-based payments Historically  the liability arising from any tax due in any jurisdiction in relation to equity compensation sat with the beneficiary of that instrument. Following a board resolution and subsequent communication to employees in the second half of 2021  the tax liability has been transferred to the Group. This liability is recognised in-line with the relative portion of fair value charged for each tranche as at the balance sheet date  under both the BEIS and LTIP  adjusted for changes in expectation with regards to the non-market vesting conditions and based on the latest market share price available as at that same date. 2.17 Revenue recognition The Group‚Äôs revenue is generated from licence or collaboration agreements. Collaboration agreements typically have an initial upfront payment  periodic collaboration payments and potential milestone payments for research  development and commercial achievements plus royalties on net sales. We initially recognise income under the collaboration as deferred revenue  which we become entitled to reclassify as revenue in line with the completion of performance obligations  measured as a percentage complete against the latest collaboration team forecasts. When the Group receives milestone payments for achieving pre-defined targets during pre-clinical and clinical development  these milestones are recognised when probable (i.e. on achievement of the pre-defined target). except where the milestone or a proportion of the milestone is to be applied to the development of the programme which is the subject of the collaboration agreement. In such circumstances  the income is deferred and recognised as income by reference to the development costs incurred in developing the programme towards the next milestone. The rules for revenue recognition are stipulated by the accounting standard IFRS 15 which we have adopted in these consolidated financial statements. 2.18 Other income The group recognises income for all government grants in relation to research and development  where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and attached conditions will be complied with. 2.19 Expenses Operating lease Payments (excluding costs for services and insurance) made under operating leases are recognised in the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease where these are short-term leases with a period remaining of less than 12 months or for low value. Other leases that are assessed under IFRS 16 as finance leases have been accounted for in accordance with IFRS. Research & development (‚ÄúR&D‚Äù) expenditure R&D expenditure  which includes a proportion of staff costs and directly attributable overheads  is currently recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as incurred  on the basis that the recognition criteria of IAS 38 (Intangible Assets) are currently not met. 2.20 Interest income and expenditure Interest income and expenditure is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as it accrues on a timely basis  by reference to the principal outstanding and effective interest rate applicable. Other finance income and expenditure relates to the fair value revaluation of the warrant liabilities at the balance sheet date  as well as the settlement of forward contracts. 2.21 Taxation Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity  in which case it is recognised in equity. Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year  using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date  and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination  and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities  using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised. 2.22 Issued capital Ordinary  preference and growth shares are classified as equity. Proceeds in excess of the par value of the shares are shown as share premium in equity and incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction of share premium  net of tax  from the proceeds. 2.23 Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event  that can be reliably measured and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects risks specific to the liability  where this would be material. 3 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty Judgements and estimates are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other relevant factors  including management‚Äôs reasonable expectations of future events. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The estimates and the underlying assumptions are subject to continuous review. The Group based its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the financial statements were prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments  however  may change due to market changes or circumstances arising that are beyond the control of the Group. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur. In preparing these consolidated financial statements  the significant judgements made by management in applying the Group‚Äôs accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty are as follows. 3.1 Critical judgements in applying accounting policies Revenue In the year  the Group entered a second collaboration agreement with AstraZeneca (‚ÄúAZ‚Äù). The new collaboration is related to two new disease areas and has been treated by the Group as a separate agreement  since it has identified new and distinct performance obligations that did not exist in the previous agreement entered in 2021. The Group‚Äôs main collaboration works across two disease areas using a similar methodology in each. In identifying the performance obligations within the contract  management has made judgements in categorizing each disease area as its own discrete performance obligation  where their delivery is both independent from one another and deemed to require an equal amount of effort  and where they are individually considered a distinct bundle of services. Goodwill and Intangible Assets The amount of goodwill and intangible assets initially recognised as a result of a business combination is dependent on the allocation of the purchase price to the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. The determination of the fair value of the assets and liabilities is based  to a considerable extent  on management‚Äôs judgement and on industry benchmarks and information relevant to the specific assets in focus. The carrying value of the goodwill is in line with the allocation of the purchase price in 2018  arising from the acquisition of BenevolentAI Cambridge Limited. During 2022  management has performed an impairment assessment on the goodwill in accordance with IAS 36. For the purposes of impairment assessment  goodwill has been allocated to the Group‚Äôs CGU defined as the whole of the BenevolentAI Group (BAI Group). CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets. Management  as part of their continued evaluation of the goodwill  has considered that the CGU for 2022 is the BAI Group  since Management has now considered that the assets held by BenevolentAI Cambridge Limited is now  and increasingly so  strategically integrated with the other legal entities in the Group. By this very nature Management believes for any future commercial value created through the current and future drug programs  then a unified and amalgamated approach is required across the whole of the Group. In 2021 for the purposes of impairment testing  goodwill has been allocated to the Group‚Äôs CGU defined as the whole of the BenevolentAI Cambridge Limited entity. Per IAS 36.6  impairment is recognised as an expense in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income if the recoverable value (higher of fair value less cost of disposal or value in use  ‚ÄúFVLCTS‚Äù) of an asset is less than its carrying value. The carrying value of the goodwill which is currently held in the balance sheet as at 31 December 2022 is ¬£23 479k. The net recoverable amount or FVLCTS of the CGU is estimated using the Group‚Äôs quoted market value at year end. Since the Group is a listed quoted entity  the fair value can be determined by the quoted share price of BAI as at closing on 31 December 2022  which was at ¬£3.10 per share (‚Ç¨3.50 per share) equivalent to an overall ¬£364 775k fair value of the CGU. This exceeds the Group‚Äôs net assets of ¬£153 999k inclusive of the goodwill amount  as such there are no impairment indicators to the current carrying value of the goodwill. 3.2 Other accounting estimates The Group has not identified any significant accounting estimates  being those which present a significant risk of material adjustment in the next financial period. However  other areas of estimation uncertainty have been identified as follow: Revenue In recognizing revenue against the individual performance obligations  estimates have been made in the calculation of their percentage complete  the key driver of revenue release. This requires an estimation of full-time equivalent (‚ÄúFTE‚Äù) days needed to fully satisfy each performance obligation. Share-based payments charge The Group operates the BenevolentAI Equity Incentive Scheme (‚ÄúBEIS‚Äù) and long-term incentive plan (‚ÄúLTIP‚Äù). The fair value of equity incentive awards  or respective portions of awards  related solely to non-market vesting conditions is measured using the Black Scholes model at each grant date. The number of equity instruments expected to vest which are tied to the non-market conditions is revisited at each balance sheet date so that  ultimately  the cumulative amount recognised over the vesting period is based on the number of instruments expected to eventually vest. The fair value of equity incentive award portions related to market vesting conditions is measured using the Monte Carlo Simulation model at each grant date. Provided all other vesting conditions are satisfied  a charge is made irrespective of whether the market vesting conditions are satisfied. The net increase in relative portion of fair value charge during the year is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. The assumptions used in both the Black Scholes and Monte Carlo Simulation models are detailed in note 28. Fair value revaluation of class A warrants and class B warrants The Company's warrants are classified and presented as derivative financial liabilities and measured at fair value through profit or loss. The fair value of each warrant class is determined at each reporting date and exercise date and is based on quoted market prices  where available  or independently valued using the Binomial Tree method and Monte Carlo Simulation models  the inputs for which derive from significant observable market inputs (volatility  discount rate and share price). Fair value revaluation of class A shares and class B shares As part of the accounting impact of the business combination with Odyssey in the year  the consideration deemed to have been issued by BAI Ltd is based on the value of Odyssey shares at the Closing date. As with the warrants  the fair value of each share class was determined based on quoted market prices  where available  or independently valued using the Binomial Tree method and Monte Carlo Simulation models  the inputs for which derive from significant observable market inputs (volatility  discount rate and share price). 4 Accounting impact of the business combination Following the successful completion of the business combination with Odyssey on 22 April 2022  BenevolentAI became the new name of the holding company of the new BAI Group. This business combination was achieved through the contribution of ordinary and preferred shares in BAI Ltd in exchange for new ordinary shares in BenevolentAI (previously Odyssey)  the result being that the new BAI Group became listed on the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange. As discussed in note 2.14  the business combination between BAI Ltd and Odyssey was accounted for as a capital reorganisation under IFRS 2 (Share-based Payment). Accordingly  the Transaction was treated as the equivalent of BAI Ltd issuing shares at the closing of the business combination for the net assets of Odyssey as at the Closing date. The excess of the fair value of consideration for Odyssey over the fair value of its identifiable net assets acquired represents a compensation for the service of a stock exchange listing for its shares and expenses as incurred. This leads to a non-cash listing service SBP expense of ¬£83.1m  determined under IFRS 2 and recognised in administrative expenses. As at Closing date  the fair value of BAI Ltd‚Äôs shares that were deemed to be issued to Odyssey amounted to ¬£88.3m  based on the initial closing price of shares of Odyssey according to the table below. In return  BenevolentAI received Odyssey‚Äôs listing service and its net assets  equal to ¬£5.2m  which mainly consisted of remaining cash net of redemptions and liabilities related to the warrants  resulting in a total non-cash listing service SBP expense of ¬£83.1m to administrative expenses. Fair value in ¬£m Class A shares (4.9 million shares at ¬£8.22 per share) 40.0 Class B shares 2/3 (5 million shares at ¬£8.22 per share) 41.1 Class B shares 1/3 (2.5 million shares at ¬£2.87 per share) 7.2 BAI Ltd‚Äôs shares deemed issued 88.3 Less Odyssey‚Äôs net assets (5.2) IFRS 2 non-cash listing service SBP expense 83.1 Odyssey‚Äôs net assets at Closing  excluding the gross proceeds of ‚Ç¨136.1m (¬£113.0m) from PIPE Financing  of which ¬£9.5m was non-cash consideration; ‚Ç¨40m (¬£33.2m) backstop; and the ¬£11.3m of expenses related to them: Fair value in ¬£m at Closing Cash 41.6 Prepayments and other debtors 0.2 Accruals and trade creditors (18.5) Warrants at fair value (18.1) Net assets acquired 5.2 The warrants acquired represent the fair value of the 10 000 000 class A warrants and 6 600 000 class B warrants at the Closing date  assessed using significant observable market inputs. In conjunction with the Transaction  Odyssey entered into subscription agreements with investors (‚ÄúPIPE Investors‚Äù) in a Private Investment in Public Equity transaction (the ‚ÄúPIPE Financing‚Äù) in the aggregate amount of ‚Ç¨136.1m (¬£113.0m). In return for their investment  the PIPE Investors received a total of 13 613 394 additional Odyssey Class A shares. An equity back stop facility for ‚Ç¨40m (¬£33.2m) resulted in a further issuance of 4 000 000 ordinary shares were also issued (see note 29). This resulted in a total consideration of ¬£146.2m across the equity PIPE and Backstop  of which ¬£136.7m was received as cash. Prior to closing  as consistent with the original public share offering by Odyssey  a total of 25.1 million ordinary shares with an agreed redemption price of ‚Ç¨9.96 per share were redeemed for cash by eligible ordinary shareholders  following the redemption process. These are currently held as treasury shares. The redemption payable of ‚Ç¨250.3m (¬£207.8m) was paid by Odyssey prior to Transaction close. As part of the capital reorganisation  BAI Ltd‚Äôs share capital was exchanged for shares in Odyssey of ¬£75k  being 90 million shares at a par value of ‚Ç¨0.001. This capital reorganisation reflects the transition of the share capital and share premium from BAI Ltd to BenevolentAI. This results in a decrease within share capital of ¬£0.2m from the old share capital (par value of ¬£0.10) with an increase of ¬£584.5m reflecting the share premium as recorded by Odyssey in the share for share exchange. The book value accounted for on consolidation is reflected through a corresponding charge to merger difference of ¬£579.1m  such that the net impact to equity of ¬£5.2m is equal to the net assets acquired of ¬£5.2m. See note 29 for further details of the share for share exchange. 5 Revenue We initially recognise income under the AstraZeneca collaborations as deferred revenue  which we become entitled to recognise as revenue in line with the delivery efforts towards the completion of tasks and provision of the deliverables set out in the agreements governing the AZ collaborations. For the year to 31 December 2022  this is represented by a revenue of ¬£10.6m (2021: ¬£4.6m). Second AZ collaboration Building on the success of the first collaboration  the relationship with AZ has been expanded into a new 3-year partnership  starting 1 January 2022 and focusing on systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and heart failure (HF). As the result of this collaboration  BenevolentAI received an upfront fee of $15m (¬£11.8m) in January 2022. As the result of the upfront fee  a total of ¬£2.9m deferred revenue is recognised as of 31 December 2022 (31 December 2021: ¬£nil). Management have determined that costs directly attributable to the collaboration agreements are immaterial  and consequently cost of sales has not been presented. There is no related party revenue in the year to 31 December 2022 (year to 31 December 2021: ¬£nil). See note 31 for related party information. 2022 ¬£‚Äô000 2021 ¬£‚Äô000 By category: Collaboration revenue 10 560 4 625 10 560 4 625 2022 ¬£'000 2021 ¬£'000 By geographical market: UK 10 560 4 625 10 560 4 625 Revenue recognised in relation to contract liabilities since the beginning of each year has been explored further in note 23. 6 Research and development expenditure 2022 ¬£'000 2021 restated ¬£'000 Drug discovery 47 601 31 846 Included within drug discovery expenses: SBP expenses 4 422 4 717 Product and technology 24 283 25 070 Included within product & technology expenses: SBP expenses 2 369 5 107 71 884 56 916 The majority of the expenditure in drug discovery is related to staff costs and advancement of the BenevolentAI pipeline into later stages.

The total expense relating to this plan in the current year was ¬£1 392k (2021: ¬£1 081k). There was an accrual of ¬£260k at 31 December 2022 (2021: ¬£nil). 10 Finance income 2022 ¬£'000 2021 ¬£'000 Interest income on bank deposits 1 544 52 Unwinding of rent deposits 5 4 Fair value revaluation of warrants 17 737 - 19 286 56 Whilst the number of warrants in issue at the year end remains the same as at the Closing date  the fair value determined for each class has fallen significantly. This ¬£17.7m fall in fair value  from the ¬£18.1m acquired at the Closing date (per note 4) to the year end balance of ¬£0.4m (per note 24)  is represented as a credit to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. 11 Finance expense 2022 ¬£'000 2021 ¬£'000 Interest expense on lease liabilities 417 448 Interest expense on cash held 80 - Bank fees 42 - Change in fair value of settled forward contract 1 565 - 2 104 448 12 Taxation 2022 ¬£000 2021 restated ¬£000 Recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income Current tax on income for the year 15 924 12 026 Deferred tax - 2 033 Total tax credit 15 924 14 059 Reconciliation of effective tax rate Loss for the year before taxation (179 852) (121 714) Tax using the UK corporation tax rate of 19% (2021:19.00%) (34 172) (23 126) Reversal of DT (rights to future income) - 2 033 Surrender of tax losses for R&D tax credit refund 4 946 3 748 Additional deduction for R&D expenditure (11 820) (8 944) R&D expenditure credits 31 17 Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 23 770 6 333 Deferred tax not recognised on trading losses 1 311 5 891 Fixed asset differences 10 (11) Total tax refund included in accounts (15 924) (14 059) A deferred tax asset of ¬£53.7m (2021: ¬£50m) has not been recognised due to uncertainties over future profitability. The amount of trading losses carried forward indefinitely where a deferred tax asset has not been recognised is ¬£174.3m (2021: ¬£167.4m). The UK corporation tax rate for year ended 31 December 2022 is 19% (2021: 19%). Deferred tax has been calculated using 25% (2021: 25%) as this is the corporation tax rate effective 1 April 2023  following the announcement in the Budget on 3 March 2021 which has been substantively enacted. 13 Loss per share Loss per ordinary share has been calculated by dividing the loss attributable to equity holders of BenevolentAI after taxation for each financial period by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the financial period. The weighted average number of shares is calculated from the number of ordinary and preferred BenevolentAI shares in circulation at the beginning of the period adjusted by the number of ordinary shares issued during the period  alongside the impacts of the transaction and multiplied by a time-weighting factor. The time-weighting factor reflects the ratio of the number of days on which ordinary shares were issued and the total number of days of the period. The G2 Growth Shares have been excluded as they do not attract dividends and were subsequently cancelled prior to the Transaction. As the business combination is accounted for as if BAI Ltd has acquired Odyssey  the number of shares is adjusted to reflect the exchange ratio of the share for share exchange completed during the Transaction  such as to reflect the capital structure of the legal parent. In accordance with IAS 33  the calculation of the basic and diluted loss per share for all periods presented has been adjusted retrospectively due to these changes. Note 2022 ¬£‚Äô000 2021 ¬£‚Äô000 Basic and diluted loss per share  expressed in pence (150.2p) (119.8p) Weighted average ordinary shares outstanding 109 110 109 89 885 143 Total loss for the year (163 928) (107 655) Adjustments for: Non-normalised items within operating expenses 2.4 102 436 13 611 Fair value of warrants within finance income 10 (17 737) - Normalised total loss (79 229) (94 044) Normalised basic and diluted loss per ordinary share (72.6p) (104.6p) The dilutive shares and other instruments total 145 126 303 (2021: 90 012 909)  where the conversion factor has been applied). See note 29 for further details. A loss  however  cannot be further diluted beyond the basic per share calculation. As such  the loss per share is an equal value for both a basic and diluted view. 14 Goodwill Goodwill ¬£'000 Cost Balance at 1 January 2021 23 479 Balance at 31 December 2021 23 479 Balance at 1 January 2022 23 479 Balance at 31 December 2022 23 479 Net book value At 31 December 2021 23 479 At 31 December 2022 23 479 See note 3.1 for further details. 15 Intangible assets Rights to future income ¬£'000 Software ¬£'000 Total ¬£'000 Cost Balance at 1 January 2021 10 700 66 10 766 Disposals - (20) (20) Balance at 31 December 2021 10 700 46 10 746 Balance at 1 January 2022 10 700 46 10 746 Disposals - (14) (14) Balance at 31 December 2022 10 700 32 10 732 Amortisation Balance at 1 January 2021 - 31 31 Amortisation - 12 12 Impairment 10 700 - 10 700 Disposals - (20) (20) Balance at 31 December 2021 10 700 23 10 723 Balance at 1 January 2022 10 700 23 10 723 Amortisation - 3 3 Disposals - (14) (14) Balance at 31 December 2022 10 700 12 10 712 Net book value At 31 December 2021 - 23 23 At 31 December 2022 - 20 20 Software Modest balances relate to software intangibles representing domain names and software  all of which are integrated and fully used in the business and subject to amortisation.

Sales of microdrones  primarily the ANAFI for security (ANAFI USA) and inspection (ANAFI Ai)  are up 88% to represent 55% of the group‚Äôs revenues. The 11 Pix4D software solutions focused on image analysis (photogrammetry) for mapping  inspection  security and precision farming represent 45% of revenues and are up 25%. Based on the ‚ÄúNew Scope‚Äù monitored since the start of 2022(1)  the group‚Äôs revenues came to ‚Ç¨70.7m  with year-on-year growth of +75% (+64% at constant exchange rates).2022 businessIn 2022  Parrot met the challenges linked to the general environment (electronic and industrial components shortage  inflation  health context) to respond to the growing interest in its technologies. In line with the change in the group‚Äôs positioning and the monitoring of its performance  the group now has two operating segments: the microdrones business and the photogrammetry business (details appended).REVENUES (‚Ç¨m and % of revenues) FY 202212 months FY 202112 months Change A Microdrones 39.2 55% 20.9 38% +88% B Of which  consumer products(2) 1.3 2% 6.2 11% -79% C Photogrammetry 32.7 45% 26.2 48% +25% D Parrot SA 0.7 1% 0.3 1% +174% E Intragroup eliminations (0.7) (1)% -0.8 -2% -7% F SenseFly (activity divested in October 2021) - - 7.7 14% -100% CONSOLIDATED PARROT GROUP TOTAL 71.9 100% 54.3 100% +32% NEW SCOPE TOTAL(1) (=A-B+C+D+E) 70.6 98% 40.4 74% +75%(1) ‚ÄúNew Scope Total‚Äù is a performance indicator reflecting the impact of the strategy rolled out since end-2018. It corresponds to the Parrot group‚Äôs consolidated revenues after deducting revenues from consumer products (see 2) and revenues from the subsidiaries divested (Micasense in January 2021  with no revenues in 2021  and SenseFly SA and SenseFly Inc in October 2021).(2) Consumer products: in 2022  remaining accessories (batteries  spare parts) for consumer drones (all ranges)  whose sales were finalized in 2021.Microdrones businessWith revenues of ‚Ç¨39.2m  the microdrones business recorded annual growth of +88% (+82% at constant exchange rates). Parrot has responded to the growing demand for its microdrones by securing its purchases and production capacity.The ANAFI USA  focused on the security and defense markets  has been acquired by various institutions in NATO countries (including the United States  the United Kingdom  France  Northern Europe and Japan). With its easy deployment  robust design  reliability and high level of cybersecurity  it is the leading microdrone for reconnaissance and surveillance missions. It accounts for the majority of the microdrone sales. The geopolitical context has highlighted the strategic nature of microdrones  and this certainly represents an accelerating factor1.The ANAFI Ai  designed for inspection and mapping professionals  was rolled out commercially from the first quarter of 2022  supported by a gradual promotion strategy and the deployment of professional client services around the world. Its performance features  including its image precision (48 MP sensor)  its 4G connectivity  its capabilities for automating missions (Ai) and its protection of user data  are proving very popular. Thanks in particular to its extensive ecosystem of software partners  the ANAFI Ai covers a growing number of use cases for the inspection of strategic infrastructures (telecoms  energy  engineering works)  architecture and construction.Photogrammetry businessWith revenues of ‚Ç¨32.7m  the photogrammetry business recorded annual growth of 25% (+15% at constant exchange rates). Photogrammetry is a technique based on the robust modeling of the geometry of images and their acquisition to recreate an exact 3D copy of the reality  which is used as a basis for calculations  analysis and monitoring by many professionals. The offering is made up of eight business software solutions and three applications from the Pix4D brand  combined with optional equipment (sensors  GPS) supplied by third parties. The solutions have been adopted by 55 000 users to date.The flagship products in the geomatics and mapping sectors (PIX4Dmapper  PIX4Dmatic and PIX4Dsurvey) are still the main contributors. Recognized as market-leading solutions  they enable surveyors and drone service providers to handle increasingly large-scale projects. The use of the business solutions (Pix4Dreact  Pix4Dfields) launched at the end of 2019 is gradually ramping up. The Cloud solutions deployed in businesses and major groups from the architecture  engineering and construction (AEC) or telecommunications sectors are meeting the needs for digital twins and building information modeling (BIM)  which are becoming the standard for work in these industries. The photogrammetry footprint is also expanding thanks to the diversification of compatible equipment (fixed cameras  mobile phones).2022 earningsThe consolidated and annual financial statements for the year ended December 31  2022 were approved by the Board of Directors on March 15  2023. The audit procedures have been carried out by the statutory auditors and the reports will be issued once the necessary procedures have been completed. The Universal Registration Document will then be published on: https://www.parrot.com/uk/corporate/reports.An adjustment for an error has been applied to the 2021 consolidated accounts relating to a difference in the accounting treatment between the Swiss Code of Obligations and IFRS that concerned the recognition of Pix4D SA‚Äôs employee benefit plans. In accordance with IAS 19  the commitment relating to this plan was recognized at January 1  2021 against equity. Non-current liabilities (provisions for pensions and other employee benefits) for 2021 increased by ‚Ç¨1.7m. This adjustment did not impact 2021 revenues and is notably reflected in a reduction in 2021 income from ordinary operations by ‚Ç¨0.8m and 2021 net income by ‚Ç¨0.6m. This adjustment will be detailed in a dedicated note in the notes to the 2022 consolidated financial statements. All references to the results for 2021 in this press release are based on the adjusted figures.CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT (IFRS  ‚Ç¨m) Dec 31  2022 Dec 31  2021 (adjusted) Change Revenues 71.9 54.3 +32% Cost of sales -16.0 -15.2 +5% Gross margin 56.0 39.1 +43% % of revenues 77.8% 72.0% Research and development costs -43.6 -40.7 +7% % of revenues -60.6% -75.0% Sales and marketing costs -11.1 -14.1 -21% % of revenues -15.4% -26.0% Administrative costs and overheads -14.7 -13.7 +8% % of revenues -20.5% -25.3% - Production and quality costs -5.5 -5.4 -1% % of revenues -7.6% -10.0% - Income from ordinary operations -19.0 -34.9 +46% % of revenues -26.4% -64.4% - Other operating income and expenses -0.9 30.4 -103% EBIT -19.9 -4.5 - % of revenues -27.6% -8.3% Income from cash and cash equivalents 0.0 0.0 - Gross finance costs -0.5 -0.2 - Net finance costs -0.5 -0.2 - Other financial income and expenses 2.1 1.8 - Financial income and expenses 1.6 1.5 +7% Share in income from associates -1.0 0.4 - Tax -0.4 0.0 - Net income -19.7 -2.5 - Net income (group share) -19.5 -2.5 - % of revenues -27.1% -4.6% - Non-controlling interests -0.2 0.0 -In 2022  based on ‚Ç¨71.9m of revenues and ‚Ç¨16.0m for the cost of sales  the Parrot group recorded a gross margin of ‚Ç¨56.0m  representing 77.8% of its revenues. The group‚Äôs two operating segments contributed to this on a virtually equivalent value basis. The effective management of component purchases for professional microdrones  despite the shortage  made it possible to preserve the level of the group‚Äôs margin.Building on the success of its strategy  the Parrot group continued to allocate major resources to further strengthening its position as a European leader  with operating expenditure of ‚Ç¨75.0m  up from ‚Ç¨74.0m in 2021 (including ‚Ç¨9.1m allocated to the companies that were sold in October 2021). At end-2022  the group had 542 employees (permanent and fixed-term contracts)  split between the microdrones sector and the photogrammetry sector (versus 440 at December 31  2021). The group also employs 44 external contractors (52 at December 31  2021).R&D spending totaled ‚Ç¨43.6m  compared with ‚Ç¨40.7m in 2021. In 2022  53% was allocated to microdrones  with 47% for photogrammetry. In these still young markets for professional drones  innovation continues to be at the heart of the group‚Äôs development strategy and 60% of the workforce is focused on this. The objective is to offer customers a strong level of automation for data capture and analysis. This involves continuously improving the capacity to process high volumes of information  combined with the development of artificial intelligence in equipment. With this roadmap  the integration of drone technologies is being simplified  while ensuring the quality and relevance of the data acquired  particularly in terms of recurrence. This commitment is also reflected in the continued development of the partners ecosystem. In 2022  this was made up of more than 30 suppliers of solutions  players from the drone industry in Europe and the United States  which are perfectly integrated into the group‚Äôs products.Sales and marketing costs came to ‚Ç¨11.1m  compared with ‚Ç¨14.1m in 2021. They have continued to benefit from the elimination of the resources previously allocated to the companies divested in 2021 (-‚Ç¨2.2m) and the realignment around professional activities. They are focused on growing the group‚Äôs international footprint  present in 12 countries. Professional client support is being set up with local partners offering specific business expertise. The equipment and solutions are being promoted through demonstrations of various use cases presented during Tech Days  industry conferences or webinars for instance.Administrative costs and overheads represent ‚Ç¨14.7m  compared with ‚Ç¨13.7m in 2021. The reduction made possible by the divestments (-‚Ç¨1.8m) was offset by the strengthening of support functions  particularly for photogrammetry  and the spending rolled out by the parent company. They also aim to demonstrate the better level of transparency  personal data protection and cybersecurity (organization of bug bounties  hacking competitions and independent audits).Production and quality spending totaled ‚Ç¨5.5m  compared with ‚Ç¨5.4m in 2021. The outsourced production process continues to be effectively under control despite managing complex manufacturing and assembly logistics to ensure alignment with the highest standards of quality and security.Thanks to its sales growth  combined with the proactive and effectively managed allocation of resources  the group reduced its annual current operating losses to ‚Ç¨(19.0)m  compared with ‚Ç¨(34.9)m at end-2021. Other operating income and expenses totaled ‚Ç¨(0.9)m  with ‚Ç¨(19.9)m of EBIT in 2022  while the 2021 figure benefited from ‚Ç¨29.9m of non-recurring income recorded in connection with the subsidiaries divested in January and October 2021.Change in the cash positionThe group had ‚Ç¨68.5m of net cash at end-December 2022. Cash  cash equivalents and other current financial assets came to ‚Ç¨68.5m  down ‚Ç¨14.4m compared with the previous year‚Äôs closing position.Cash flow from operating activities totaled ‚Ç¨20.1m  reflecting the resources allocated to operations  as well as the increase in working capital requirements. This is linked to an increase in inventory in response to the continued supply chain disruption.Cash flow from investment activities totaled ‚Ç¨8.9m  linked primarily to the collection of outstanding receivables following the divestment of Micasense and SenseFly  as well as the payments for the interests sold in the companies Planck Aerosystems ($3.2m) and Chouette (‚Ç¨0.6m)  less ‚Ç¨1.9m of investments in IT infrastructure and equipment.Cash flow from financing activities came to ‚Ç¨4.2m  including ‚Ç¨3.3m for the repayment of lease liabilities with the application of IFRS 16.A presentation of the balance sheet and cash flow statement is appended.OutlookThe Parrot group is deploying on professional markets that are expanding rapidly  from microdrones to photogrammetry  on which it has solid technological capabilities and offers robust responses to the geopolitical and industrial challenges seen today. However  the technological disruption and the deep changes in operational practices are making it difficult to assess and forecast rates of growth. To consolidate its positioning  Parrot is moving forward with a demanding technological roadmap  focused primarily on automation  cybersecurity and respect for user data. The expression of its assets is reflected in its sales and marketing strategy.For the microdrones serving the defense and security markets  the geopolitical situation highlights the need for equipment ensuring high levels of both performance and security in a context of increased sovereignty. The ANAFI USA is now a world front-runner in this area. However  the cycles for sales to government institutions are long and the multi-year contracts cover different scales. With this type of contract  the frequency and volumes of renewals of orders are subject to adjudication by the contracting authorities. At a time when many countries have announced significant growth in their military budgets  Parrot is mobilizing to continue expanding its client portfolio.For industrial sectors  in which microdrones and photogrammetry are combined  the disruption and changes in operational practices have gradually taken shape over several years  particularly for telecoms  energy and construction  as well as more generally the inspection sector. The improvements in terms of productivity  traceability and security (people  infrastructure and data)  and the reduced carbon footprint (vs. aeronautical or satellite imaging) that they make possible are at the heart of the needs of businesses and major groups today. The capacity for investment of these clients and prospects continues to be guided mainly by the general environment.In terms of photogrammetry solutions  the ramping up of the various markets will also involve the diversification of dedicated equipment. Mobile phones  tablets and cameras  which are widely adopted by users  require the marketing of specific equipment that must enable these technologies to be used on a larger scale. The group intends to incorporate them into its range of solutions with a view to further extending its user base.In this context  following a first quarter of 2023 marked by a consolidation of sales trends  Parrot is taking action to continue moving forward with its growth. This is the group‚Äôs core focus to gradually financially balance its operations  and it will be able to adapt its cash consumption if necessary to the pace of its growth.Next financial dates2023 first-quarter business: Thursday May 11  2023Parrot‚Äôs general shareholders‚Äô meeting: Wednesday June 14  20232023 first-half business and earnings: Friday July 28  2023ABOUT THE PARROT GROUPParrot is Europe's leading commercial UAV group.

Sales of microdrones  primarily the ANAFI for security (ANAFI USA) and inspection (ANAFI Ai)  are up 88% to represent 55% of the group‚Äôs revenues. The 11 Pix4D software solutions focused on image analysis (photogrammetry) for mapping  inspection  security and precision farming represent 45% of revenues and are up 25%. Based on the ‚ÄúNew Scope‚Äù monitored since the start of 2022(1)  the group‚Äôs revenues came to ‚Ç¨70.7m  with year-on-year growth of +75% (+64% at constant exchange rates).2022 businessIn 2022  Parrot met the challenges linked to the general environment (electronic and industrial components shortage  inflation  health context) to respond to the growing interest in its technologies. In line with the change in the group‚Äôs positioning and the monitoring of its performance  the group now has two operating segments: the microdrones business and the photogrammetry business (details appended).REVENUES (‚Ç¨m and % of revenues) FY 202212 months FY 202112 months Change A Microdrones 39.2 55% 20.9 38% +88% B Of which  consumer products(2) 1.3 2% 6.2 11% -79% C Photogrammetry 32.7 45% 26.2 48% +25% D Parrot SA 0.7 1% 0.3 1% +174% E Intragroup eliminations (0.7) (1)% -0.8 -2% -7% F SenseFly (activity divested in October 2021) - - 7.7 14% -100% CONSOLIDATED PARROT GROUP TOTAL 71.9 100% 54.3 100% +32% NEW SCOPE TOTAL(1) (=A-B+C+D+E) 70.6 98% 40.4 74% +75%(1) ‚ÄúNew Scope Total‚Äù is a performance indicator reflecting the impact of the strategy rolled out since end-2018. It corresponds to the Parrot group‚Äôs consolidated revenues after deducting revenues from consumer products (see 2) and revenues from the subsidiaries divested (Micasense in January 2021  with no revenues in 2021  and SenseFly SA and SenseFly Inc in October 2021).(2) Consumer products: in 2022  remaining accessories (batteries  spare parts) for consumer drones (all ranges)  whose sales were finalized in 2021.Microdrones businessWith revenues of ‚Ç¨39.2m  the microdrones business recorded annual growth of +88% (+82% at constant exchange rates). Parrot has responded to the growing demand for its microdrones by securing its purchases and production capacity.The ANAFI USA  focused on the security and defense markets  has been acquired by various institutions in NATO countries (including the United States  the United Kingdom  France  Northern Europe and Japan). With its easy deployment  robust design  reliability and high level of cybersecurity  it is the leading microdrone for reconnaissance and surveillance missions. It accounts for the majority of the microdrone sales. The geopolitical context has highlighted the strategic nature of microdrones  and this certainly represents an accelerating factor1.The ANAFI Ai  designed for inspection and mapping professionals  was rolled out commercially from the first quarter of 2022  supported by a gradual promotion strategy and the deployment of professional client services around the world. Its performance features  including its image precision (48 MP sensor)  its 4G connectivity  its capabilities for automating missions (Ai) and its protection of user data  are proving very popular. Thanks in particular to its extensive ecosystem of software partners  the ANAFI Ai covers a growing number of use cases for the inspection of strategic infrastructures (telecoms  energy  engineering works)  architecture and construction.Photogrammetry businessWith revenues of ‚Ç¨32.7m  the photogrammetry business recorded annual growth of 25% (+15% at constant exchange rates). Photogrammetry is a technique based on the robust modeling of the geometry of images and their acquisition to recreate an exact 3D copy of the reality  which is used as a basis for calculations  analysis and monitoring by many professionals. The offering is made up of eight business software solutions and three applications from the Pix4D brand  combined with optional equipment (sensors  GPS) supplied by third parties. The solutions have been adopted by 55 000 users to date.The flagship products in the geomatics and mapping sectors (PIX4Dmapper  PIX4Dmatic and PIX4Dsurvey) are still the main contributors. Recognized as market-leading solutions  they enable surveyors and drone service providers to handle increasingly large-scale projects. The use of the business solutions (Pix4Dreact  Pix4Dfields) launched at the end of 2019 is gradually ramping up. The Cloud solutions deployed in businesses and major groups from the architecture  engineering and construction (AEC) or telecommunications sectors are meeting the needs for digital twins and building information modeling (BIM)  which are becoming the standard for work in these industries. The photogrammetry footprint is also expanding thanks to the diversification of compatible equipment (fixed cameras  mobile phones).2022 earningsThe consolidated and annual financial statements for the year ended December 31  2022 were approved by the Board of Directors on March 15  2023. The audit procedures have been carried out by the statutory auditors and the reports will be issued once the necessary procedures have been completed. The Universal Registration Document will then be published on: https://www.parrot.com/uk/corporate/reports.An adjustment for an error has been applied to the 2021 consolidated accounts relating to a difference in the accounting treatment between the Swiss Code of Obligations and IFRS that concerned the recognition of Pix4D SA‚Äôs employee benefit plans. In accordance with IAS 19  the commitment relating to this plan was recognized at January 1  2021 against equity. Non-current liabilities (provisions for pensions and other employee benefits) for 2021 increased by ‚Ç¨1.7m. This adjustment did not impact 2021 revenues and is notably reflected in a reduction in 2021 income from ordinary operations by ‚Ç¨0.8m and 2021 net income by ‚Ç¨0.6m. This adjustment will be detailed in a dedicated note in the notes to the 2022 consolidated financial statements. All references to the results for 2021 in this press release are based on the adjusted figures.CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT (IFRS  ‚Ç¨m) Dec 31  2022 Dec 31  2021 (adjusted) Change Revenues 71.9 54.3 +32% Cost of sales -16.0 -15.2 +5% Gross margin 56.0 39.1 +43% % of revenues 77.8% 72.0% Research and development costs -43.6 -40.7 +7% % of revenues -60.6% -75.0% Sales and marketing costs -11.1 -14.1 -21% % of revenues -15.4% -26.0% Administrative costs and overheads -14.7 -13.7 +8% % of revenues -20.5% -25.3% - Production and quality costs -5.5 -5.4 -1% % of revenues -7.6% -10.0% - Income from ordinary operations -19.0 -34.9 +46% % of revenues -26.4% -64.4% - Other operating income and expenses -0.9 30.4 -103% EBIT -19.9 -4.5 - % of revenues -27.6% -8.3% Income from cash and cash equivalents 0.0 0.0 - Gross finance costs -0.5 -0.2 - Net finance costs -0.5 -0.2 - Other financial income and expenses 2.1 1.8 - Financial income and expenses 1.6 1.5 +7% Share in income from associates -1.0 0.4 - Tax -0.4 0.0 - Net income -19.7 -2.5 - Net income (group share) -19.5 -2.5 - % of revenues -27.1% -4.6% - Non-controlling interests -0.2 0.0 -In 2022  based on ‚Ç¨71.9m of revenues and ‚Ç¨16.0m for the cost of sales  the Parrot group recorded a gross margin of ‚Ç¨56.0m  representing 77.8% of its revenues. The group‚Äôs two operating segments contributed to this on a virtually equivalent value basis. The effective management of component purchases for professional microdrones  despite the shortage  made it possible to preserve the level of the group‚Äôs margin.Building on the success of its strategy  the Parrot group continued to allocate major resources to further strengthening its position as a European leader  with operating expenditure of ‚Ç¨75.0m  up from ‚Ç¨74.0m in 2021 (including ‚Ç¨9.1m allocated to the companies that were sold in October 2021). At end-2022  the group had 542 employees (permanent and fixed-term contracts)  split between the microdrones sector and the photogrammetry sector (versus 440 at December 31  2021). The group also employs 44 external contractors (52 at December 31  2021).R&D spending totaled ‚Ç¨43.6m  compared with ‚Ç¨40.7m in 2021. In 2022  53% was allocated to microdrones  with 47% for photogrammetry. In these still young markets for professional drones  innovation continues to be at the heart of the group‚Äôs development strategy and 60% of the workforce is focused on this. The objective is to offer customers a strong level of automation for data capture and analysis. This involves continuously improving the capacity to process high volumes of information  combined with the development of artificial intelligence in equipment. With this roadmap  the integration of drone technologies is being simplified  while ensuring the quality and relevance of the data acquired  particularly in terms of recurrence. This commitment is also reflected in the continued development of the partners ecosystem. In 2022  this was made up of more than 30 suppliers of solutions  players from the drone industry in Europe and the United States  which are perfectly integrated into the group‚Äôs products.Sales and marketing costs came to ‚Ç¨11.1m  compared with ‚Ç¨14.1m in 2021. They have continued to benefit from the elimination of the resources previously allocated to the companies divested in 2021 (-‚Ç¨2.2m) and the realignment around professional activities. They are focused on growing the group‚Äôs international footprint  present in 12 countries. Professional client support is being set up with local partners offering specific business expertise. The equipment and solutions are being promoted through demonstrations of various use cases presented during Tech Days  industry conferences or webinars for instance.Administrative costs and overheads represent ‚Ç¨14.7m  compared with ‚Ç¨13.7m in 2021. The reduction made possible by the divestments (-‚Ç¨1.8m) was offset by the strengthening of support functions  particularly for photogrammetry  and the spending rolled out by the parent company. They also aim to demonstrate the better level of transparency  personal data protection and cybersecurity (organization of bug bounties  hacking competitions and independent audits).Production and quality spending totaled ‚Ç¨5.5m  compared with ‚Ç¨5.4m in 2021. The outsourced production process continues to be effectively under control despite managing complex manufacturing and assembly logistics to ensure alignment with the highest standards of quality and security.Thanks to its sales growth  combined with the proactive and effectively managed allocation of resources  the group reduced its annual current operating losses to ‚Ç¨(19.0)m  compared with ‚Ç¨(34.9)m at end-2021. Other operating income and expenses totaled ‚Ç¨(0.9)m  with ‚Ç¨(19.9)m of EBIT in 2022  while the 2021 figure benefited from ‚Ç¨29.9m of non-recurring income recorded in connection with the subsidiaries divested in January and October 2021.Change in the cash positionThe group had ‚Ç¨68.5m of net cash at end-December 2022. Cash  cash equivalents and other current financial assets came to ‚Ç¨68.5m  down ‚Ç¨14.4m compared with the previous year‚Äôs closing position.Cash flow from operating activities totaled ‚Ç¨20.1m  reflecting the resources allocated to operations  as well as the increase in working capital requirements. This is linked to an increase in inventory in response to the continued supply chain disruption.Cash flow from investment activities totaled ‚Ç¨8.9m  linked primarily to the collection of outstanding receivables following the divestment of Micasense and SenseFly  as well as the payments for the interests sold in the companies Planck Aerosystems ($3.2m) and Chouette (‚Ç¨0.6m)  less ‚Ç¨1.9m of investments in IT infrastructure and equipment.Cash flow from financing activities came to ‚Ç¨4.2m  including ‚Ç¨3.3m for the repayment of lease liabilities with the application of IFRS 16.A presentation of the balance sheet and cash flow statement is appended.OutlookThe Parrot group is deploying on professional markets that are expanding rapidly  from microdrones to photogrammetry  on which it has solid technological capabilities and offers robust responses to the geopolitical and industrial challenges seen today. However  the technological disruption and the deep changes in operational practices are making it difficult to assess and forecast rates of growth. To consolidate its positioning  Parrot is moving forward with a demanding technological roadmap  focused primarily on automation  cybersecurity and respect for user data. The expression of its assets is reflected in its sales and marketing strategy.For the microdrones serving the defense and security markets  the geopolitical situation highlights the need for equipment ensuring high levels of both performance and security in a context of increased sovereignty. The ANAFI USA is now a world front-runner in this area. However  the cycles for sales to government institutions are long and the multi-year contracts cover different scales. With this type of contract  the frequency and volumes of renewals of orders are subject to adjudication by the contracting authorities. At a time when many countries have announced significant growth in their military budgets  Parrot is mobilizing to continue expanding its client portfolio.For industrial sectors  in which microdrones and photogrammetry are combined  the disruption and changes in operational practices have gradually taken shape over several years  particularly for telecoms  energy and construction  as well as more generally the inspection sector. The improvements in terms of productivity  traceability and security (people  infrastructure and data)  and the reduced carbon footprint (vs. aeronautical or satellite imaging) that they make possible are at the heart of the needs of businesses and major groups today. The capacity for investment of these clients and prospects continues to be guided mainly by the general environment.In terms of photogrammetry solutions  the ramping up of the various markets will also involve the diversification of dedicated equipment. Mobile phones  tablets and cameras  which are widely adopted by users  require the marketing of specific equipment that must enable these technologies to be used on a larger scale. The group intends to incorporate them into its range of solutions with a view to further extending its user base.In this context  following a first quarter of 2023 marked by a consolidation of sales trends  Parrot is taking action to continue moving forward with its growth. This is the group‚Äôs core focus to gradually financially balance its operations  and it will be able to adapt its cash consumption if necessary to the pace of its growth.Next financial dates2023 first-quarter business: Thursday May 11  2023Parrot‚Äôs general shareholders‚Äô meeting: Wednesday June 14  20232023 first-half business and earnings: Friday July 28  2023ABOUT THE PARROT GROUPParrot is Europe's leading commercial UAV group.

By their nature  such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and assumptions which might cause the actual results  financial condition  performance or achievements of UCB  or industry results  to differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Important factors that could result in such differences include: the global spread and impact of COVID-19  changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  will progress to product approval or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products  which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB's efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover  sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment  including pricing pressure  political and public scrutiny  customer and prescriber patterns or practices  and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes.

The performance as a whole - exceeding the guidance disclosed to the market - is clear proof of the success of the strategic repositioning of our businesses  the result of various acquisitions.All this  combined with the many efficiency measures put in place by Management  has enabled us to further strengthen our operating-financial standing  despite a market and geopolitical scenario still dominated by uncertainty  marked among other things by a sharp increase in the cost of inputs""  stressed Antonio Porro  CEO of the Mondadori Group. PERFORMANCE AT 31 DECEMBER 2022Consolidated revenue amounted to ‚Ç¨ 903 million  growing by 11.8% versus 2021  despite the disposals in the Media area  thanks in particular to both the inclusion of D Scuola in the consolidation scope and the positive trend of the Books market  which benefited the Trade Books and Retail areas. Adjusted EBITDA came to ‚Ç¨ 136.3 million  increasing by approximately ‚Ç¨ 31 million  or improving by 29% : one-third of this strong growth stems from the operating performance of the original scope  thanks to the increased efficiency achieved  and two-thirds from the consolidation of D Scuola.Overall  profitability stood at 15.1%  up by 2 percentage points versus 2021. EBITDA   which came to ‚Ç¨ 130.7 million versus ‚Ç¨ 91.1 million in 2021  improved even more ( +43% )  thanks to the operating trend and to the reduction in restructuring costs in the Media and Corporate areas versus the prior year. EBIT   amounting to ‚Ç¨ 72.7 million  recorded a sharp improvement versus 2021 ( +60.8% )  despite the impact of higher amortization (‚Ç¨ 4.7 million) arising from the Purchase Price Allocation process of goodwill resulting from the concluded acquisitions (especially D Scuola).EBIT in 2022 also includes a number of write-offs  totaling ‚Ç¨ 7.2 million (‚Ç¨ 7.4 million in 2021)  resulting from the impairment process (relating in particular to the TV Sorrisi e Canzoni brand in the Media area  which was affected mainly by the increase in the discounting rates adopted). Adjusted EBIT in 2022  net of extraordinary expense and all non-cash items related to Purchase Price Allocation and impairment processes  would amount to ‚Ç¨ 90.1 million  up by more than ‚Ç¨ 22 million versus the prior year. Total financial expense for the period  amounting to ‚Ç¨ 5.7 million  increased by ‚Ç¨ 1 million  as a result of the Group's higher average financial debt and the new evaluation of the earn-out from the acquisition of Hej! (‚Ç¨ 0.9 million). The consolidated result before tax closed with a positive ‚Ç¨ 66.9 million versus ‚Ç¨ 38.6 million in 2021 (+73%).Contributing to the strong increase of ‚Ç¨ 28.3 million was the improvement of ‚Ç¨ 1.3 million in the results of the associates resulting from the disposal on 1 January 2022 of the stake in Monradio and the start of the accounting of the share of profits of A.L.I.  which more than offset the ‚Ç¨ 1.7 million write-down of the stake in Attica. Net profit   after non-controlling interests  amounted to ‚Ç¨ 52.1 million  up by 18%   the best result achieved by the Group in the last 15 years ; neutralizing the non-operating effects that impacted on 2021 and 2022  adjusted net profit would amount to ‚Ç¨ 64 million  up by more than 50%. In addition to the buoyant performance of operations  the Group confirmed solid cash generation in the year  with Cash Flow from Ordinary Operations of ‚Ç¨ 70.2 million versus ‚Ç¨ 68.2 million in 2021. The Net Financial Position (before IFRS 16) stood at ‚Ç¨ -106.1 million (‚Ç¨ -94.8 million in 2021); considering the effects of IFRS 16  the NFP stood at ‚Ç¨ -177.4 million  lower than ‚Ç¨ -179.1 million at December 2021  with a debt/Adjusted EBITDA ratio of 1.3x.The minor change in the Net Financial Position between 2021 and 2022 shows - also looking ahead - the Group's ability to self-finance  with its own cash generation  the active M&A policy implemented over the last year  preserving the ability to distribute dividends. 2022 saw  in fact  the return to a shareholder remuneration policy with the distribution of dividends totaling approximately ‚Ç¨ 22 million  equal to a pay-out of 50% of 2021 net profit. At 31 December 2022  Group employees amounted to 1 900 units  up by 5% versus 1 810 units at 31 December 2021 (+90)  due mainly to the inclusion of D Scuola staff (a total of 125 units).Neutralizing the effect of all scope changes - namely  the acquisitions of D Scuola  De Agostini Libri and Star Comics  and the disposals of titles and assets in the Media area - the Group workforce would drop by approximately 1%  thanks to the continued efforts to increase the efficiency of individual corporate areas and functions. BUSINESS OUTLOOKThe Group's current setup  operating performance  and cash generation ability shown in 2022 allow us to estimatea further improvement in results for the new year  despite the continuing negative impacts of rising prices related to the purchase of raw materials and services. From a strategic point of view  the Group intends to continue on the path ofconsolidatingits core business and therefore its leadership in the Books area  from a publishing point of view  by strengthening the identity and specialization of the various publishing houses  and by pursuing the process of vertical integration of book chain activities. In the School textbooks segment  the Group will also complete the operational integration project of D Scuola. In the Retail area  Mondadori will continue  on the one hand  the selective development of the network of stores functional to the completion of the widespread coverage of the Country  as well as the remodelling and downsizing of stores in order to optimize retail space and maximize network efficiency  and on the other  its efforts to focus on the book product in order to both increase the profitability of the area and to enhance its effectiveness in conveying the Group's publishing proposition to the market. In the Media area  the Mondadori Group will concurrently continue on the path of developing its digital skills and range of products  with particular regard to its presence on Social channels and influencer marketing. Thanks to the financial and capital solidity achieved  the Group can continue on the virtuous path of development it embarked on a few years ago  pursued also through the continued use  especially in the books and digital businesses  of M&As  beneficial to the Group's intention to continue to seize opportunities for inorganic growth. Income StatementThe Group's operating and financial targets that follow refer to a scope that includes only completed extraordinary transactions  therefore: in the Books area  full consolidation for the whole year of A.L.I. - Agenzia Libraria International  De Agostini Libri and Libromania (consolidated for 9 months in 2022)  as well as Star Comics (consolidated for 6 months in 2022);area  full consolidation for the whole year of A.L.I. - Agenzia Libraria International  De Agostini Libri and Libromania (consolidated for 9 months in 2022)  as well as Star Comics (consolidated for 6 months in 2022); in the Media area  deconsolidation for the whole year of Press-di and the print and digital operations referring to the Grazia and Icon In light of the above and the relevant context  reasonable estimates for 2023 point to a: single-digit growth of revenue   in relation to which the above changes in the consolidation scope will have a neutral impact overall; the different business areas are in fact expected to show different trends: growth in the areas focused on the Book product  an increase in the Digital segment of the Media area  and  consistent with the structural downtrend of markets  a continued reduction in the Print Media business  which is expected at year-end to account for less than 10% of Group revenue;  in relation to which the above changes in the consolidation scope will have a neutral impact overall; the different business areas are in fact expected to show different trends: growth in the areas focused on the Book product  an increase in the Digital segment of the Media area  and  consistent with the structural downtrend of markets  a continued reduction in the Print Media business  which is expected at year-end to account for less than 10% of Group revenue; Single-digit growth of adjusted EBITDA . Even net of the recognition of relief to the museum business that benefited 2022 (approximately ‚Ç¨ 6.4 million)  not planned however for 2023  adjusted EBITDA would grow high single-digit. Margins are likewise expected to grow - from 14% to 15% - thanks to: targeted pricing policies  careful cost containment policies  completion of the operational integration of D Scuola .

Today  Wendel is a very solid company  with high-quality teams and excellent financial health.It is on the basis of these strong fundamentals  inherited from Andr√© Fran√ßois Poncet  that Wendel is ready to write a new chapter in its development  based on strategic orientations that create value for all its shareholders. Our first ambition is to invest around ‚Ç¨2 billion in the next 24 months in companies in Europe and North America. Wendel will be a hands-on  influential shareholder  working closely with its portfolio companies to accelerate their growth. This is the case for Bureau Veritas  whose potential is clear.Wendel has also decided to develop a third-party asset management business  leveraging the proven track record and expertise of its teams. This new business  which will grow over time  will be another source of value creation alongside our activity as a long-term investor. Our objective is to target a double-digit TSR.I would like to thank Wendel‚Äôs Supervisory Board and Nicolas ver Hulst  its Chairman  for their confidence and their full support to the Executive board to implement this strategy  for which the roadmap will be defined in the coming months.‚Äù2022 net sales2022 consolidated net sales(in millions of euros) 2021 2022 Œî Organic Œî Bureau Veritas 4 981.1 5 650.6 +13.4% +7.8% Constantia Flexibles(1) 1 603.4 1 954.5 +21.9% +23.6% Stahl 831.3 914.9 +10.1% +6.3% CPI 88.2 114.2 +29.5% +17.0% ACAMS(2) n/a 66.2 n/a n/a Consolidated net sales 7 503.9 8 700.4 +15.9% +10.7%Organic growth in Constantia Flexibles net sales is calculated based on a like for like scope excluding India  which was classified as discontinued operations according to IFRS 5 in 2022.

The financial statements were audited by the Statutory Auditors prior to their publication.Wendel Group‚Äôs consolidated net sales totaled ‚Ç¨8 700.4 million  up +15.9% overall and up +10.7% organically. FX contribution is positive  up +4.6% and scope effect is 0.6% including the effect of Constantia Flexibles‚Äô Indian operations being classified as discontinued operations in accordance with IFRS 5.The overall contribution of Group companies to net income from operations amounted to ‚Ç¨670.6 million  up +2.6% year on year. This contribution is impacted by a negative scope effect resulting from the deconsolidation of Cromology and IHS Towers in 2022. Adjusted4 for these scope effects  net income from operations was up +17.2% in 2022.Financial expenses  operating expenses and taxes at Wendel SE level totaled ‚Ç¨118.7 million  up +6.6% from the ‚Ç¨111.3 million reported in 2021. Operating expenses were up notably due to an increase in rent payments as well as other items  partially offset by a decrease in financial expenses.Non-recurring income came in at ‚Ç¨610.6 million  compared to ‚Ç¨846.3 million in 2021. This change is largely due to the accounting treatment in 2021 of the deconsolidation of IHS Towers following its IPO which generated  a ‚Ç¨913 million capital gain (corresponding to the difference between the IPO value and the net book value in Wendel‚Äôs consolidated financial statements).As a result of the above  consolidated net income reached ‚Ç¨1 022.1 million in 2022 (‚Ç¨1 376.4 million in 2021) and net income Group share ‚Ç¨656.3 million (‚Ç¨1 046.9 million in 2021).Group companies‚Äô resultsFigures include IFRS 16 unless otherwise specified.Bureau Veritas: Strong operating and financial performance delivered in 2022; Solid 2023 outlook(full consolidation)Revenue in 2022 amounted to ‚Ç¨5 650.6 million  a +13.4% increase compared with 2021. Organic revenue was up +7.8% in 2022  benefiting from solid trends across most businesses and geographies and a maintained momentum for Sustainability and ESG-related solutions across the entire portfolio  representing 55% of Bureau Veritas sales through the BV Green Line of services and solutions.Four businesses delivered high single-digit to low double-digit organic revenue growth  with Industry up +11.4%  Marine & Offshore +9.4%  Agri-Food & Commodities +9.3% and Buildings & Infrastructure (B&I) +7.6%. The remainder of the portfolio saw low to mid organic revenue growth with Certification  up +5.5% and Consumer Products  up +1.0%.The scope effect was a positive +0.9% (including 1.6% in the last quarter)  reflecting the four bolt-on acquisitions realized in 2022  alongside those of the prior year. Currency fluctuations had a positive impact of +4.7% (including a positive impact of 3.0% in Q4 2022)  mainly due to the strong appreciation of the USD and pegged currencies against the euro  which was partly offset by the depreciation of some emerging countries‚Äô currencies.Adjusted operating profit increased by 12.5% to ‚Ç¨902.1 million; the 2022 adjusted operating margin decreased by 13 basis points to 16.0%  including a 6 basis-point positive foreign exchange impact and a 1-basis point negative scope impact. Excluding the Chinese impact  it progressed by c.10 basis points to 16.2% compared to 2021.Strong financial positionAt the end of December 2022  Bureau Veritas‚Äô adjusted net financial debt decreased compared with the level at December 31  2021. Bureau Veritas has a solid financial structure with the bulk of its maturities beyond 2024 and 100% at fixed interest rates. Bureau Veritas had ‚Ç¨1.7 billion in available cash and cash equivalents and ‚Ç¨600 million in undrawn committed credit lines. At December 31  2022  the adjusted net financial debt/EBITDA ratio was further reduced to 0.97x5 (from 1.10x as of December 31  2021). The average maturity of Bureau Veritas‚Äô financial debt was 3.9 years. 100% of debt at fixed rate with a blended average cost of funds over the year of 2.1% excluding the impact of IFRS 16 (compared with 2.3% in 2021 excluding the impact of IFRS 16).Proposed dividendThe Board of Directors of Bureau Veritas is proposing a dividend of EUR 0.77 per share  payable in cash  for 2022  up +45.3% compared to the prior year. Moving forward  Bureau Veritas expects to maintain a dividend of around 65% of its adjusted net profit. This is subject to the approval of the Shareholders‚Äô Meeting to be held on June 22  2023.Strong free cash flow at ‚Ç¨657 million driven by operating performanceFree cash flow (operating cash flow after tax  interest expenses and capex) was ‚Ç¨657.0 million (11.6% of Group revenue)  compared to ‚Ç¨603.0 million in 2021  up +9.0% year on year  notably led by currency moves  a reversing trend versus 2021.

Significant organic growth of +23.6%7 mainly driven by price increases but also through mix improvement and volume growth. EBITDA reached the record level of ‚Ç¨256.4 million  up 27.6% vs 2021.(Full consolidation)Full-year sales totaled ‚Ç¨1 954.5 million  up +23.6% on an organic basis with a strong performance across both Consumer and Pharma markets. The growth was driven by (i) price increases to compensate for the impact of cost inflation  (ii) volume growth notably in the pharma market  and (iii) a favorable sales mix effect. Total growth was +21.9%. The acquisitions of Propak in June 2021 and FFP Packaging Solutions in August 2022 contributed positively to top line growth (+3.7%) and foreign exchange by +4.5%. In accordance with IFRS 5  Indian activities are classified as discontinued operations and are not consolidated anymore. Impact on total growth was -9.8%.Full-year EBITDA of ‚Ç¨256.4 million8 (representing a reported margin of 13.1% versus 12.5% last year) improved by ‚Ç¨55.4m driven by: (i) continued growth in Pharma with a significant overall improvement in the US operations (ii) strong performance in the Aluminum division with the hub plant optimizing its sales mix whilst the satellite plants continued to enhance performance through operational excellence and organic volume growth (iii) excellent performance in the Film division with strong international organic growth and Propak (acquired in June 2021) delivering a record full-year performance. Throughout the year margins were protected by successfully passing through the unprecedented cost inflation to the customer base on a timely basis whilst effectively managing the significant supply chain disruptions. EBITDA margins based on 2020 price levels improved from 12.6% to 16.0%.Net debt stood at ‚Ç¨313.1 million9 at the end of 2022 representing a significant reduction from the ‚Ç¨400.3 million on December 31  2021 reflecting the strong performance and improved cash generation of the Group in 2022 whilst also funding the acquisition of FFP and growth capital expenditure. Leverage ratio has been improved to 1.2x EBITDA compared to 1.8x at the beginning of the year.On March 2  2023  Constantia announced the acquisition of the Polish company Drukpol Flexo  a well-established player in the Polish flexible packaging market thereby further enhancing the Group‚Äôs flexo printing capabilities after the Propak and FFP acquisitions. It also provides access to a more local customer base and enhances the Group‚Äôs cost competitiveness.On January 20  2023 Constantia Flexibles  signed a joint venture agreement for its Indian business with Premji Invest and SB Packagings.

Record EBITDA margin at 51.5%; continued cash flow generation and deleveraging.(Full consolidation)Crisis Prevention Institute recorded revenue of $120.1 million in 2022  up +15.1% in total compared to 2021  or +17.0% organically. Foreign exchange impact was -1.8%. This performance reflects several factors:Continued enhancements to the sales and marketing functions enabled the Company to drive quality leads and increase sales team efficiency;Growth in new programs  including specialty topics such as Trauma  Autism  and Advanced Physical Skills;International growth outside North America of +20%. Promising international expansion outside of North America  with the 2021 launch of the French market and in the UAE in 2023;Continued mix shift towards digital solutions for both new Certified Instructors and renewals into mandatory in-person training programs. Virtual Learner Materials continue to comprise a strong share of overall delivery  accounting for 44% of total Learner Materials sales.The strong revenue growth was accompanied by an even stronger EBITDA growth of +20.2% to $61.9 million10. This corresponds with a record margin of 51.5% over the period (+210 basis points versus 2021). EBITDA benefited primarily from the flow-through of higher sales to earnings  effective cost management  and early year labor vacancy. CPI‚Äôs operating costs  however  are expected to increase in 2023.As of December 31  2022  net debt totaled $300.6 million11  or 4.9x EBITDA as defined in CPI‚Äôs credit agreement  reflecting a c. 35% decline in leverage levels since acquisition in December 2019. In 2022  cash flow conversion represented c.80% of EBITDA12. Furthermore  in July 2022  CPI amended its credit agreement  resulting in more attractive pricing and terms.Stahl ‚Äì Sales up +10.1% with organic growth of +6.3% mostly driven by strong performance of Performance Coatings division and price increases to offset input cost inflation. Solid EBITDA margin at 21.2% with very strong cash generation. Strategic acquisition of ICP Industrial Solutions Group in the field of Specialty Coatings.(Full consolidation)Stahl  the world leader in specialty coatings for flexible substrates  posted total sales of ‚Ç¨914.9 million in 2022  representing an increase of +10.1% over 2021. Organic growth was +6.3% while FX contributed positively (+3.8%)  mostly through USD and RMB strengthening against the Euro.Activity for the period was above expectations at group level  with a strong growth in Performance Coatings and positive price/mix effects as volumes declined  notably due to (i) the slowdown in certain end markets especially for the Leather business and (ii) China lockdowns.Across all segments  price increases have been implemented throughout the year to mitigate the strong impact of rising input costs. Stahl‚Äôs management continues to closely monitor the inflationary environment  as well as any supply chain disruptions.FY2022 EBITDA13 amounted to ‚Ç¨194.3 million  translating into an EBITDA margin of 21.2%  in line with Stahl‚Äôs historical levels. Stahl remained highly cash generative  notably thanks to the good EBITDA level. As a result  net debt as of December 31  2022  was ‚Ç¨97.7 million14  vs. ‚Ç¨183.8 million end of June 2022.On 16 March 2023  the Stahl Group acquired 100% of the shares in ICP Industrial Solutions Group (ISG)  a leader in high-performance packaging coatings which reinforces Stahl‚Äôs position as the global leader in the field of specialty coatings for flexible materials. ICP ISG offers a comprehensive portfolio of high-performance coatings used primarily in packaging and labeling applications  notably in the resilient food and pharmaceutical sectors. It is mostly present in North America (close to 70% of sales).Following this acquisition  Stahl sales will cross the ‚Ç¨1 billion mark with an EBITDA margin above 20%. The transaction is carried out at an enterprise value of c. $205 million.Concurrently  Stahl secured new financing of $580 million with a group of relationship banks  extending maturities until 2028. The financing will be used to finance this acquisition  refinance its existing credit facilities and fund future external growth  with a focus on opportunities in specialty coatings.Stahl‚Äôs standalone leverage was reported at 0.4x15 EBITDA as of December 31  2022. Pro forma of the ISG transaction  leverage would stand at 1.5x.Stahl announced on July 5  2022  the submission of a greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction target  aligned with the most recent guidance provided by the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi). Stahl‚Äôs extended commitment builds on the company‚Äôs existing targets to reduce its emissions for Scopes 1 and 2  which were set shortly after the Paris Agreement in 2015. Stahl has since reduced its Scope 1 and 2 (direct) GHG emissions by more than 30%  thanks to operational efficiency gains and by decarbonizing its energy supply.In September 2022  Stahl was awarded the highest EcoVadis Platinum rating  placing it within the top 1% of companies assessed by EcoVadis. The award underlines Stahl‚Äôs commitment to collaborating with its partners to reduce its environmental impact and build a more responsible and transparent supply chain.ACAMS ‚Äì Strong 2022 performance for ACAMS  with revenue up +15.4% and EBITDA margin of 19.7%. Carve-out process on track.(Full consolidation since March 10  2022 ‚Äì Unaudited figures)On March 10  2022  Wendel acquired ACAMS  a global leader in professional education and training for anti-financial crime (AFC) professionals.ACAMS reported 2022 revenue of $98.4 million16  up +15.4% vs. the same period in 2021. Organic growth was +15.9%  and the impact of foreign exchange was -0.5%. Year-over-year growth was driven by conference recovery and greater sales of Certifications  Memberships and Training  especially to large bank customers across the globe. 2022 revenue growth benefited from the increasing regulatory activity amidst the recent geopolitical turmoil. At the end of December 2022  ACAMS‚Äô global membership base reached 103k  a +12% increase compared to December 2021. In Q4 2022  ACAMS launched the Certified Cryptoasset Anti-Financial Crime Specialist (CCAS) credential to mitigate the illicit-finance risks associated with blockchain technology for anti-financial crime professionals engaged with the virtual-asset sector.As of December 31  2022  EBITDA17 pro forma for the carve-out was c. $19.4 million  resulting in a pro forma margin of 19.7%. ACAMS is targeting go-forward EBITDA margin in excess of 20%.As of December 31  2022  net debt totaled $143.4 million18  which represents 5.9x EBITDA as defined in ACAMS‚Äô credit agreement. ACAMS‚Äô cash flow generation was impacted by one-time expenditures related to the carve-out  but ACAMS is expected to deliver cash conversion above 75% on a run-rate basis.19ACAMS‚Äô separation from its prior parent company is nearly complete is expected to be finalized during the first half of 2023.Tarkett ‚Äì Sustained sales growth driven by Sport and price increases despite volume slowdown in the 4th quarter. Improved adjusted EBITDA due to positive inflation balance in 2022.(Equity method)In 2022 Tarkett totaled ‚Ç¨3 359 million in net sales  up by +20.3% compared to 2021. Organic growth reached +8.9%  or +11.7% including sales price increases in the CIS countries implemented to counter the inflation in purchasing costs (price adjustments in the CIS are historically excluded from organic growth to offset currency movements). The effect of sales price increases implemented across all segments is +11.7% on average in 2022 compared to 2021. Volumes were stable for the year. Record activity in Sport and growth in the commercial segments in North America offset the slowdown in the CIS and residential segments. The foreign exchange impact made a positive contribution  particularly thanks to the strengthening of the dollar against the euro.Adjusted EBITDA was ‚Ç¨234.9 million  or 7.0% of revenue  compared to ‚Ç¨229 million in 2021  or 8.2% of revenue. Inflation in raw materials  energy and transport is unprecedented. It was ‚Ç¨268 million and was accompanied by tensions on the supply of certain raw materials in the first part of the year. Tarkett successfully implemented sales price increases throughout the year achieving a favorable effect of ‚Ç¨327 million compared to 2021  resulting in a positive inflation balance of ‚Ç¨59 million  beyond the initial inflation neutralization target. Although volumes were broadly constant  the product mix deteriorated and had a negative effect on profitability. Industrial productivity was ‚Ç¨13 million  lower than expected  mainly due to lower business volumes. It therefore only partially compensated for the increase in salaries and overheads.Working capital requirement was ‚Ç¨233 million at the end of December 2022  compared to ‚Ç¨90 million at the end of December 2021  a historically low level. Inventories have increased due to inflation  growing activities  and the need to replenish inventories of raw materials and certain finished products in an environment with supply difficulties  and in value due to inflation.Tarkett generated a negative free cash flow for the year of ‚Äê‚Ç¨148.3 million  down from 2021 (‚Ç¨19.5 million)  impacted by the significant increase in working capital requirement.

Tarkett had a good amount of liquidity  ‚Ç¨479 million  at the end of 2022 comprising the undrawn RCF in an amount of ‚Ç¨215 million  other confirmed and unconfirmed credit lines in an amount of ‚Ç¨44 million and ‚Ç¨221 million in cash.2023 Outlook (published on February 15th):The macroeconomic environment will continue to impact the level of demand in 2023  particularly due to the level of inflation and interest rate rises.The geopolitical situation in Russia and Ukraine is having a significant impact on demand in the region‚Äôs main markets. In Russia  where Tarkett generated approximately 9% of its revenue in 2022 (based on average exchange rates in 2022)  Tarkett observed an approximately 25% lower of business volume than in 2021.In this context  Tarkett has taken immediate steps to reduce discretionary spending. At the same time  actions to reduce the cost structure are being implemented in the regions most affected by the slowdown in activity.Tarkett is also implementing all necessary measures to reduce debt leverage. The level of activity in the factories has been significantly reduced in order to adapt the level of production to demand and to reduce inventories in areas where sales volumes are slowing down. Structural measures to simplify product ranges and optimize inventory management are also contributing to the control of working capital requirement. Investments will be made selectively  the level of capital expenditure will be limited to ‚Ç¨90 million.For more information: https://www.tarkett-group.com/en/investors/IHS Towers ‚Äì IHS Towers will report its FY 2022 results on March 28  2023Wendel Growth: accelerating the development through new capital commitments and already new direct investments realized by the new teamWith Wendel Growth (formerly Wendel Lab)  Wendel invests via funds or directly in innovative  high-growth companies.

Our first ambition is to invest around ‚Ç¨2 billion in the next 24 months in companies in Europe and North America. Wendel will be a hands-on  influential shareholder  working closely with its portfolio companies to accelerate their growth. This is the case for Bureau Veritas  whose potential is clear.Wendel has also decided to develop a third-party asset management business  leveraging the proven track record and expertise of its teams. This new business  which will grow over time  will be another source of value creation alongside our activity as a long-term investor. Our objective is to target a double-digit TSR.I would like to thank Wendel‚Äôs Supervisory Board and Nicolas ver Hulst  its Chairman  for their confidence and their full support to the Executive board to implement this strategy  for which the roadmap will be defined in the coming months.‚Äù2022 net sales 2022 consolidated net sales (in millions of euros) 2021 2022 Œî Organic Œî Bureau Veritas 4 981.1 5 650.6 +13.4% +7.8% Constantia Flexibles(1) 1 603.4 1 954.5 +21.9% +23.6% Stahl 831.3 914.9 +10.1% +6.3% CPI 88.2 114.2 +29.5% +17.0% ACAMS(2) n/a 66.2 n/a n/a Consolidated net sales 7 503.9 8 700.4 +15.9% +10.7% Organic growth in Constantia Flexibles net sales is calculated based on a like for like scope excluding India  which was classified as discontinued operations according to IFRS 5 in 2022.

The financial statements were audited by the Statutory Auditors prior to their publication. Wendel Group‚Äôs consolidated net sales totaled ‚Ç¨8 700.4 million  up +15.9% overall and up +10.7% organically. FX contribution is positive  up +4.6% and scope effect is 0.6% including the effect of Constantia Flexibles‚Äô Indian operations being classified as discontinued operations in accordance with IFRS 5. The overall contribution of Group companies to net income from operations amounted to ‚Ç¨670.6 million  up +2.6% year on year. This contribution is impacted by a negative scope effect resulting from the deconsolidation of Cromology and IHS Towers in 2022. Adjusted4 for these scope effects  net income from operations was up +17.2% in 2022. Financial expenses  operating expenses and taxes at Wendel SE level totaled ‚Ç¨118.7 million  up +6.6% from the ‚Ç¨111.3 million reported in 2021. Operating expenses were up notably due to an increase in rent payments as well as other items  partially offset by a decrease in financial expenses. Non-recurring income came in at ‚Ç¨610.6 million  compared to ‚Ç¨846.3 million in 2021. This change is largely due to the accounting treatment in 2021 of the deconsolidation of IHS Towers following its IPO which generated  a ‚Ç¨913 million capital gain (corresponding to the difference between the IPO value and the net book value in Wendel‚Äôs consolidated financial statements). As a result of the above  consolidated net income reached ‚Ç¨1 022.1 million in 2022 (‚Ç¨1 376.4 million in 2021) and net income Group share ‚Ç¨656.3 million (‚Ç¨1 046.9 million in 2021). Group companies‚Äô results Figures include IFRS 16 unless otherwise specified. Bureau Veritas: Strong operating and financial performance delivered in 2022; Solid 2023 outlook (full consolidation) Revenue in 2022 amounted to ‚Ç¨5 650.6 million  a +13.4% increase compared with 2021. Organic revenue was up +7.8% in 2022  benefiting from solid trends across most businesses and geographies and a maintained momentum for Sustainability and ESG-related solutions across the entire portfolio  representing 55% of Bureau Veritas sales through the BV Green Line of services and solutions. Four businesses delivered high single-digit to low double-digit organic revenue growth  with Industry up +11.4%  Marine & Offshore +9.4%  Agri-Food & Commodities +9.3% and Buildings & Infrastructure (B&I) +7.6%. The remainder of the portfolio saw low to mid organic revenue growth with Certification  up +5.5% and Consumer Products  up +1.0%. The scope effect was a positive +0.9% (including 1.6% in the last quarter)  reflecting the four bolt-on acquisitions realized in 2022  alongside those of the prior year. Currency fluctuations had a positive impact of +4.7% (including a positive impact of 3.0% in Q4 2022)  mainly due to the strong appreciation of the USD and pegged currencies against the euro  which was partly offset by the depreciation of some emerging countries‚Äô currencies. Adjusted operating profit increased by 12.5% to ‚Ç¨902.1 million; the 2022 adjusted operating margin decreased by 13 basis points to 16.0%  including a 6 basis-point positive foreign exchange impact and a 1-basis point negative scope impact. Excluding the Chinese impact  it progressed by c.10 basis points to 16.2% compared to 2021. Strong financial position At the end of December 2022  Bureau Veritas‚Äô adjusted net financial debt decreased compared with the level at December 31  2021. Bureau Veritas has a solid financial structure with the bulk of its maturities beyond 2024 and 100% at fixed interest rates. Bureau Veritas had ‚Ç¨1.7 billion in available cash and cash equivalents and ‚Ç¨600 million in undrawn committed credit lines. At December 31  2022  the adjusted net financial debt/EBITDA ratio was further reduced to 0.97x5 (from 1.10x as of December 31  2021). The average maturity of Bureau Veritas‚Äô financial debt was 3.9 years. 100% of debt at fixed rate with a blended average cost of funds over the year of 2.1% excluding the impact of IFRS 16 (compared with 2.3% in 2021 excluding the impact of IFRS 16). Proposed dividend The Board of Directors of Bureau Veritas is proposing a dividend of EUR 0.77 per share  payable in cash  for 2022  up +45.3% compared to the prior year. Moving forward  Bureau Veritas expects to maintain a dividend of around 65% of its adjusted net profit. This is subject to the approval of the Shareholders‚Äô Meeting to be held on June 22  2023. Strong free cash flow at ‚Ç¨657 million driven by operating performance Free cash flow (operating cash flow after tax  interest expenses and capex) was ‚Ç¨657.0 million (11.6% of Group revenue)  compared to ‚Ç¨603.0 million in 2021  up +9.0% year on year  notably led by currency moves  a reversing trend versus 2021. On an organic basis  free cash flow was up +2.6% year on year.

Significant organic growth of +23.6%7 mainly driven by price increases but also through mix improvement and volume growth. EBITDA reached the record level of ‚Ç¨256.4 million  up 27.6% vs 2021. (Full consolidation) Full-year sales totaled ‚Ç¨1 954.5 million  up +23.6% on an organic basis with a strong performance across both Consumer and Pharma markets. The growth was driven by (i) price increases to compensate for the impact of cost inflation  (ii) volume growth notably in the pharma market  and (iii) a favorable sales mix effect. Total growth was +21.9%. The acquisitions of Propak in June 2021 and FFP Packaging Solutions in August 2022 contributed positively to top line growth (+3.7%) and foreign exchange by +4.5%. In accordance with IFRS 5  Indian activities are classified as discontinued operations and are not consolidated anymore. Impact on total growth was -9.8%. Full-year EBITDA of ‚Ç¨256.4 million8 (representing a reported margin of 13.1% versus 12.5% last year) improved by ‚Ç¨55.4m driven by: (i) continued growth in Pharma with a significant overall improvement in the US operations (ii) strong performance in the Aluminum division with the hub plant optimizing its sales mix whilst the satellite plants continued to enhance performance through operational excellence and organic volume growth (iii) excellent performance in the Film division with strong international organic growth and Propak (acquired in June 2021) delivering a record full-year performance. Throughout the year margins were protected by successfully passing through the unprecedented cost inflation to the customer base on a timely basis whilst effectively managing the significant supply chain disruptions. EBITDA margins based on 2020 price levels improved from 12.6% to 16.0%.Net debt stood at ‚Ç¨313.1 million9 at the end of 2022 representing a significant reduction from the ‚Ç¨400.3 million on December 31  2021 reflecting the strong performance and improved cash generation of the Group in 2022 whilst also funding the acquisition of FFP and growth capital expenditure. Leverage ratio has been improved to 1.2x EBITDA compared to 1.8x at the beginning of the year. On March 2  2023  Constantia announced the acquisition of the Polish company Drukpol Flexo  a well-established player in the Polish flexible packaging market thereby further enhancing the Group‚Äôs flexo printing capabilities after the Propak and FFP acquisitions. It also provides access to a more local customer base and enhances the Group‚Äôs cost competitiveness. On January 20  2023 Constantia Flexibles  signed a joint venture agreement for its Indian business with Premji Invest and SB Packagings. The combination will help Constantia Flexibles achieve its ambition to grow further and create value in the Indian market both organically as well through further acquisitions.On the sustainability front  Constantia is actively developing and promoting its Ecolutions portfolio in line with the industry transformation towards recyclable packaging.

Crisis Prevention Institute ‚Äì Revenue growth of +15.1% as compared with 2021  +17.0% organically. Record EBITDA margin at 51.5%; continued cash flow generation and deleveraging. (Full consolidation) Crisis Prevention Institute recorded revenue of $120.1 million in 2022  up +15.1% in total compared to 2021  or +17.0% organically. Foreign exchange impact was -1.8%. This performance reflects several factors: Continued enhancements to the sales and marketing functions enabled the Company to drive quality leads and increase sales team efficiency;Growth in new programs  including specialty topics such as Trauma  Autism  and Advanced Physical Skills;International growth outside North America of +20%. Promising international expansion outside of North America  with the 2021 launch of the French market and in the UAE in 2023;Continued mix shift towards digital solutions for both new Certified Instructors and renewals into mandatory in-person training programs. Virtual Learner Materials continue to comprise a strong share of overall delivery  accounting for 44% of total Learner Materials sales. The strong revenue growth was accompanied by an even stronger EBITDA growth of +20.2% to $61.9 million10. This corresponds with a record margin of 51.5% over the period (+210 basis points versus 2021). EBITDA benefited primarily from the flow-through of higher sales to earnings  effective cost management  and early year labor vacancy. CPI‚Äôs operating costs  however  are expected to increase in 2023. As of December 31  2022  net debt totaled $300.6 million11  or 4.9x EBITDA as defined in CPI‚Äôs credit agreement  reflecting a c. 35% decline in leverage levels since acquisition in December 2019. In 2022  cash flow conversion represented c.80% of EBITDA12. Furthermore  in July 2022  CPI amended its credit agreement  resulting in more attractive pricing and terms. Stahl ‚Äì Sales up +10.1% with organic growth of +6.3% mostly driven by strong performance of Performance Coatings division and price increases to offset input cost inflation. Solid EBITDA margin at 21.2% with very strong cash generation. Strategic acquisition of ICP Industrial Solutions Group in the field of Specialty Coatings. (Full consolidation) Stahl  the world leader in specialty coatings for flexible substrates  posted total sales of ‚Ç¨914.9 million in 2022  representing an increase of +10.1% over 2021. Organic growth was +6.3% while FX contributed positively (+3.8%)  mostly through USD and RMB strengthening against the Euro. Activity for the period was above expectations at group level  with a strong growth in Performance Coatings and positive price/mix effects as volumes declined  notably due to (i) the slowdown in certain end markets especially for the Leather business and (ii) China lockdowns. Across all segments  price increases have been implemented throughout the year to mitigate the strong impact of rising input costs. Stahl‚Äôs management continues to closely monitor the inflationary environment  as well as any supply chain disruptions. FY2022 EBITDA13 amounted to ‚Ç¨194.3 million  translating into an EBITDA margin of 21.2%  in line with Stahl‚Äôs historical levels. Stahl remained highly cash generative  notably thanks to the good EBITDA level. As a result  net debt as of December 31  2022  was ‚Ç¨97.7 million14  vs. ‚Ç¨183.8 million end of June 2022. On 16 March 2023  the Stahl Group acquired 100% of the shares in ICP Industrial Solutions Group (ISG)  a leader in high-performance packaging coatings which reinforces Stahl‚Äôs position as the global leader in the field of specialty coatings for flexible materials. ICP ISG offers a comprehensive portfolio of high-performance coatings used primarily in packaging and labeling applications  notably in the resilient food and pharmaceutical sectors. It is mostly present in North America (close to 70% of sales). Following this acquisition  Stahl sales will cross the ‚Ç¨1 billion mark with an EBITDA margin above 20%. The transaction is carried out at an enterprise value of c. $205 million. Concurrently  Stahl secured new financing of $580 million with a group of relationship banks  extending maturities until 2028. The financing will be used to finance this acquisition  refinance its existing credit facilities and fund future external growth  with a focus on opportunities in specialty coatings. Stahl‚Äôs standalone leverage was reported at 0.4x15 EBITDA as of December 31  2022. Pro forma of the ISG transaction  leverage would stand at 1.5x. Stahl announced on July 5  2022  the submission of a greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction target  aligned with the most recent guidance provided by the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi). Stahl‚Äôs extended commitment builds on the company‚Äôs existing targets to reduce its emissions for Scopes 1 and 2  which were set shortly after the Paris Agreement in 2015. Stahl has since reduced its Scope 1 and 2 (direct) GHG emissions by more than 30%  thanks to operational efficiency gains and by decarbonizing its energy supply. In September 2022  Stahl was awarded the highest EcoVadis Platinum rating  placing it within the top 1% of companies assessed by EcoVadis. The award underlines Stahl‚Äôs commitment to collaborating with its partners to reduce its environmental impact and build a more responsible and transparent supply chain. ACAMS ‚Äì Strong 2022 performance for ACAMS  with revenue up +15.4% and EBITDA margin of 19.7%. Carve-out process on track. (Full consolidation since March 10  2022 ‚Äì Unaudited figures) On March 10  2022  Wendel acquired ACAMS  a global leader in professional education and training for anti-financial crime (AFC) professionals. ACAMS reported 2022 revenue of $98.4 million16  up +15.4% vs. the same period in 2021. Organic growth was +15.9%  and the impact of foreign exchange was -0.5%. Year-over-year growth was driven by conference recovery and greater sales of Certifications  Memberships and Training  especially to large bank customers across the globe. 2022 revenue growth benefited from the increasing regulatory activity amidst the recent geopolitical turmoil. At the end of December 2022  ACAMS‚Äô global membership base reached 103k  a +12% increase compared to December 2021. In Q4 2022  ACAMS launched the Certified Cryptoasset Anti-Financial Crime Specialist (CCAS) credential to mitigate the illicit-finance risks associated with blockchain technology for anti-financial crime professionals engaged with the virtual-asset sector. As of December 31  2022  EBITDA17 pro forma for the carve-out was c. $19.4 million  resulting in a pro forma margin of 19.7%. ACAMS is targeting go-forward EBITDA margin in excess of 20%. As of December 31  2022  net debt totaled $143.4 million18  which represents 5.9x EBITDA as defined in ACAMS‚Äô credit agreement. ACAMS‚Äô cash flow generation was impacted by one-time expenditures related to the carve-out  but ACAMS is expected to deliver cash conversion above 75% on a run-rate basis.19 ACAMS‚Äô separation from its prior parent company is nearly complete is expected to be finalized during the first half of 2023. Tarkett ‚Äì Sustained sales growth driven by Sport and price increases despite volume slowdown in the 4th quarter. Improved adjusted EBITDA due to positive inflation balance in 2022. (Equity method) In 2022 Tarkett totaled ‚Ç¨3 359 million in net sales  up by +20.3% compared to 2021. Organic growth reached +8.9%  or +11.7% including sales price increases in the CIS countries implemented to counter the inflation in purchasing costs (price adjustments in the CIS are historically excluded from organic growth to offset currency movements). The effect of sales price increases implemented across all segments is +11.7% on average in 2022 compared to 2021. Volumes were stable for the year. Record activity in Sport and growth in the commercial segments in North America offset the slowdown in the CIS and residential segments. The foreign exchange impact made a positive contribution  particularly thanks to the strengthening of the dollar against the euro. Adjusted EBITDA was ‚Ç¨234.9 million  or 7.0% of revenue  compared to ‚Ç¨229 million in 2021  or 8.2% of revenue. Inflation in raw materials  energy and transport is unprecedented. It was ‚Ç¨268 million and was accompanied by tensions on the supply of certain raw materials in the first part of the year. Tarkett successfully implemented sales price increases throughout the year achieving a favorable effect of ‚Ç¨327 million compared to 2021  resulting in a positive inflation balance of ‚Ç¨59 million  beyond the initial inflation neutralization target. Although volumes were broadly constant  the product mix deteriorated and had a negative effect on profitability. Industrial productivity was ‚Ç¨13 million  lower than expected  mainly due to lower business volumes. It therefore only partially compensated for the increase in salaries and overheads. Working capital requirement was ‚Ç¨233 million at the end of December 2022  compared to ‚Ç¨90 million at the end of December 2021  a historically low level. Inventories have increased due to inflation  growing activities  and the need to replenish inventories of raw materials and certain finished products in an environment with supply difficulties  and in value due to inflation. Tarkett generated a negative free cash flow for the year of ‚Äê‚Ç¨148.3 million  down from 2021 (‚Ç¨19.5 million)  impacted by the significant increase in working capital requirement. Free cash flow generation was particularly significant in the fourth quarter thanks to inventory reduction actions. Net financial debt was ‚Ç¨655 million at the end of December 2022  compared with ‚Ç¨476 million at the end of December 2021  including an increase of ‚Ç¨20 million related to the currency effect on dollar‚Äêdenominated debt. Debt leverage stands at 2.8x adjusted EBITDA at the end of December 2022. Tarkett had a good amount of liquidity  ‚Ç¨479 million  at the end of 2022 comprising the undrawn RCF in an amount of ‚Ç¨215 million  other confirmed and unconfirmed credit lines in an amount of ‚Ç¨44 million and ‚Ç¨221 million in cash. 2023 Outlook (published on February 15th): The macroeconomic environment will continue to impact the level of demand in 2023  particularly due to the level of inflation and interest rate rises. The geopolitical situation in Russia and Ukraine is having a significant impact on demand in the region‚Äôs main markets. In Russia  where Tarkett generated approximately 9% of its revenue in 2022 (based on average exchange rates in 2022)  Tarkett observed an approximately 25% lower of business volume than in 2021. In this context  Tarkett has taken immediate steps to reduce discretionary spending. At the same time  actions to reduce the cost structure are being implemented in the regions most affected by the slowdown in activity. Tarkett is also implementing all necessary measures to reduce debt leverage. The level of activity in the factories has been significantly reduced in order to adapt the level of production to demand and to reduce inventories in areas where sales volumes are slowing down. Structural measures to simplify product ranges and optimize inventory management are also contributing to the control of working capital requirement. Investments will be made selectively  the level of capital expenditure will be limited to ‚Ç¨90 million.

Our first ambition is to invest around ‚Ç¨2 billion in the next 24 months in companies in Europe and North America. Wendel will be a hands-on  influential shareholder  working closely with its portfolio companies to accelerate their growth. This is the case for Bureau Veritas  whose potential is clear.Wendel has also decided to develop a third-party asset management business  leveraging the proven track record and expertise of its teams.

The financial statements were audited by the Statutory Auditors prior to their publication. Wendel Group‚Äôs consolidated net sales totaled ‚Ç¨8 700.4 million  up +15.9% overall and up +10.7% organically. FX contribution is positive  up +4.6% and scope effect is 0.6% including the effect of Constantia Flexibles‚Äô Indian operations being classified as discontinued operations in accordance with IFRS 5. The overall contribution of Group companies to net income from operations amounted to ‚Ç¨670.6 million  up +2.6% year on year. This contribution is impacted by a negative scope effect resulting from the deconsolidation of Cromology and IHS Towers in 2022. Adjusted4 for these scope effects  net income from operations was up +17.2% in 2022. Financial expenses  operating expenses and taxes at Wendel SE level totaled ‚Ç¨118.7 million  up +6.6% from the ‚Ç¨111.3 million reported in 2021. Operating expenses were up notably due to an increase in rent payments as well as other items  partially offset by a decrease in financial expenses. Non-recurring income came in at ‚Ç¨610.6 million  compared to ‚Ç¨846.3 million in 2021. This change is largely due to the accounting treatment in 2021 of the deconsolidation of IHS Towers following its IPO which generated  a ‚Ç¨913 million capital gain (corresponding to the difference between the IPO value and the net book value in Wendel‚Äôs consolidated financial statements). As a result of the above  consolidated net income reached ‚Ç¨1 022.1 million in 2022 (‚Ç¨1 376.4 million in 2021) and net income Group share ‚Ç¨656.3 million (‚Ç¨1 046.9 million in 2021). Group companies‚Äô results Figures include IFRS 16 unless otherwise specified. Bureau Veritas: Strong operating and financial performance delivered in 2022; Solid 2023 outlook (full consolidation) Revenue in 2022 amounted to ‚Ç¨5 650.6 million  a +13.4% increase compared with 2021. Organic revenue was up +7.8% in 2022  benefiting from solid trends across most businesses and geographies and a maintained momentum for Sustainability and ESG-related solutions across the entire portfolio  representing 55% of Bureau Veritas sales through the BV Green Line of services and solutions. Four businesses delivered high single-digit to low double-digit organic revenue growth  with Industry up +11.4%  Marine & Offshore +9.4%  Agri-Food & Commodities +9.3% and Buildings & Infrastructure (B&I) +7.6%. The remainder of the portfolio saw low to mid organic revenue growth with Certification  up +5.5% and Consumer Products  up +1.0%. The scope effect was a positive +0.9% (including 1.6% in the last quarter)  reflecting the four bolt-on acquisitions realized in 2022  alongside those of the prior year. Currency fluctuations had a positive impact of +4.7% (including a positive impact of 3.0% in Q4 2022)  mainly due to the strong appreciation of the USD and pegged currencies against the euro  which was partly offset by the depreciation of some emerging countries‚Äô currencies. Adjusted operating profit increased by 12.5% to ‚Ç¨902.1 million; the 2022 adjusted operating margin decreased by 13 basis points to 16.0%  including a 6 basis-point positive foreign exchange impact and a 1-basis point negative scope impact. Excluding the Chinese impact  it progressed by c.10 basis points to 16.2% compared to 2021. Strong financial position At the end of December 2022  Bureau Veritas‚Äô adjusted net financial debt decreased compared with the level at December 31  2021. Bureau Veritas has a solid financial structure with the bulk of its maturities beyond 2024 and 100% at fixed interest rates. Bureau Veritas had ‚Ç¨1.7 billion in available cash and cash equivalents and ‚Ç¨600 million in undrawn committed credit lines. At December 31  2022  the adjusted net financial debt/EBITDA ratio was further reduced to 0.97x5 (from 1.10x as of December 31  2021). The average maturity of Bureau Veritas‚Äô financial debt was 3.9 years. 100% of debt at fixed rate with a blended average cost of funds over the year of 2.1% excluding the impact of IFRS 16 (compared with 2.3% in 2021 excluding the impact of IFRS 16). Proposed dividend The Board of Directors of Bureau Veritas is proposing a dividend of EUR 0.77 per share  payable in cash  for 2022  up +45.3% compared to the prior year. Moving forward  Bureau Veritas expects to maintain a dividend of around 65% of its adjusted net profit. This is subject to the approval of the Shareholders‚Äô Meeting to be held on June 22  2023. Strong free cash flow at ‚Ç¨657 million driven by operating performance Free cash flow (operating cash flow after tax  interest expenses and capex) was ‚Ç¨657.0 million (11.6% of Group revenue)  compared to ‚Ç¨603.0 million in 2021  up +9.0% year on year  notably led by currency moves  a reversing trend versus 2021.

Significant organic growth of +23.6%7 mainly driven by price increases but also through mix improvement and volume growth. EBITDA reached the record level of ‚Ç¨256.4 million  up 27.6% vs 2021. (Full consolidation) Full-year sales totaled ‚Ç¨1 954.5 million  up +23.6% on an organic basis with a strong performance across both Consumer and Pharma markets. The growth was driven by (i) price increases to compensate for the impact of cost inflation  (ii) volume growth notably in the pharma market  and (iii) a favorable sales mix effect. Total growth was +21.9%. The acquisitions of Propak in June 2021 and FFP Packaging Solutions in August 2022 contributed positively to top line growth (+3.7%) and foreign exchange by +4.5%. In accordance with IFRS 5  Indian activities are classified as discontinued operations and are not consolidated anymore. Impact on total growth was -9.8%. Full-year EBITDA of ‚Ç¨256.4 million8 (representing a reported margin of 13.1% versus 12.5% last year) improved by ‚Ç¨55.4m driven by: (i) continued growth in Pharma with a significant overall improvement in the US operations (ii) strong performance in the Aluminum division with the hub plant optimizing its sales mix whilst the satellite plants continued to enhance performance through operational excellence and organic volume growth (iii) excellent performance in the Film division with strong international organic growth and Propak (acquired in June 2021) delivering a record full-year performance. Throughout the year margins were protected by successfully passing through the unprecedented cost inflation to the customer base on a timely basis whilst effectively managing the significant supply chain disruptions. EBITDA margins based on 2020 price levels improved from 12.6% to 16.0%.Net debt stood at ‚Ç¨313.1 million9 at the end of 2022 representing a significant reduction from the ‚Ç¨400.3 million on December 31  2021 reflecting the strong performance and improved cash generation of the Group in 2022 whilst also funding the acquisition of FFP and growth capital expenditure. Leverage ratio has been improved to 1.2x EBITDA compared to 1.8x at the beginning of the year. On March 2  2023  Constantia announced the acquisition of the Polish company Drukpol Flexo  a well-established player in the Polish flexible packaging market thereby further enhancing the Group‚Äôs flexo printing capabilities after the Propak and FFP acquisitions. It also provides access to a more local customer base and enhances the Group‚Äôs cost competitiveness. On January 20  2023 Constantia Flexibles  signed a joint venture agreement for its Indian business with Premji Invest and SB Packagings. The combination will help Constantia Flexibles achieve its ambition to grow further and create value in the Indian market both organically as well through further acquisitions.On the sustainability front  Constantia is actively developing and promoting its Ecolutions portfolio in line with the industry transformation towards recyclable packaging.

Crisis Prevention Institute ‚Äì Revenue growth of +15.1% as compared with 2021  +17.0% organically. Record EBITDA margin at 51.5%; continued cash flow generation and deleveraging. (Full consolidation) Crisis Prevention Institute recorded revenue of $120.1 million in 2022  up +15.1% in total compared to 2021  or +17.0% organically. Foreign exchange impact was -1.8%. This performance reflects several factors: Continued enhancements to the sales and marketing functions enabled the Company to drive quality leads and increase sales team efficiency;Growth in new programs  including specialty topics such as Trauma  Autism  and Advanced Physical Skills;International growth outside North America of +20%. Promising international expansion outside of North America  with the 2021 launch of the French market and in the UAE in 2023;Continued mix shift towards digital solutions for both new Certified Instructors and renewals into mandatory in-person training programs. Virtual Learner Materials continue to comprise a strong share of overall delivery  accounting for 44% of total Learner Materials sales. The strong revenue growth was accompanied by an even stronger EBITDA growth of +20.2% to $61.9 million10. This corresponds with a record margin of 51.5% over the period (+210 basis points versus 2021). EBITDA benefited primarily from the flow-through of higher sales to earnings  effective cost management  and early year labor vacancy. CPI‚Äôs operating costs  however  are expected to increase in 2023. As of December 31  2022  net debt totaled $300.6 million11  or 4.9x EBITDA as defined in CPI‚Äôs credit agreement  reflecting a c. 35% decline in leverage levels since acquisition in December 2019. In 2022  cash flow conversion represented c.80% of EBITDA12. Furthermore  in July 2022  CPI amended its credit agreement  resulting in more attractive pricing and terms. Stahl ‚Äì Sales up +10.1% with organic growth of +6.3% mostly driven by strong performance of Performance Coatings division and price increases to offset input cost inflation. Solid EBITDA margin at 21.2% with very strong cash generation. Strategic acquisition of ICP Industrial Solutions Group in the field of Specialty Coatings. (Full consolidation) Stahl  the world leader in specialty coatings for flexible substrates  posted total sales of ‚Ç¨914.9 million in 2022  representing an increase of +10.1% over 2021. Organic growth was +6.3% while FX contributed positively (+3.8%)  mostly through USD and RMB strengthening against the Euro. Activity for the period was above expectations at group level  with a strong growth in Performance Coatings and positive price/mix effects as volumes declined  notably due to (i) the slowdown in certain end markets especially for the Leather business and (ii) China lockdowns. Across all segments  price increases have been implemented throughout the year to mitigate the strong impact of rising input costs. Stahl‚Äôs management continues to closely monitor the inflationary environment  as well as any supply chain disruptions. FY2022 EBITDA13 amounted to ‚Ç¨194.3 million  translating into an EBITDA margin of 21.2%  in line with Stahl‚Äôs historical levels. Stahl remained highly cash generative  notably thanks to the good EBITDA level. As a result  net debt as of December 31  2022  was ‚Ç¨97.7 million14  vs. ‚Ç¨183.8 million end of June 2022. On 16 March 2023  the Stahl Group acquired 100% of the shares in ICP Industrial Solutions Group (ISG)  a leader in high-performance packaging coatings which reinforces Stahl‚Äôs position as the global leader in the field of specialty coatings for flexible materials. ICP ISG offers a comprehensive portfolio of high-performance coatings used primarily in packaging and labeling applications  notably in the resilient food and pharmaceutical sectors. It is mostly present in North America (close to 70% of sales). Following this acquisition  Stahl sales will cross the ‚Ç¨1 billion mark with an EBITDA margin above 20%. The transaction is carried out at an enterprise value of c. $205 million. Concurrently  Stahl secured new financing of $580 million with a group of relationship banks  extending maturities until 2028. The financing will be used to finance this acquisition  refinance its existing credit facilities and fund future external growth  with a focus on opportunities in specialty coatings. Stahl‚Äôs standalone leverage was reported at 0.4x15 EBITDA as of December 31  2022. Pro forma of the ISG transaction  leverage would stand at 1.5x. Stahl announced on July 5  2022  the submission of a greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction target  aligned with the most recent guidance provided by the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi). Stahl‚Äôs extended commitment builds on the company‚Äôs existing targets to reduce its emissions for Scopes 1 and 2  which were set shortly after the Paris Agreement in 2015. Stahl has since reduced its Scope 1 and 2 (direct) GHG emissions by more than 30%  thanks to operational efficiency gains and by decarbonizing its energy supply. In September 2022  Stahl was awarded the highest EcoVadis Platinum rating  placing it within the top 1% of companies assessed by EcoVadis. The award underlines Stahl‚Äôs commitment to collaborating with its partners to reduce its environmental impact and build a more responsible and transparent supply chain. ACAMS ‚Äì Strong 2022 performance for ACAMS  with revenue up +15.4% and EBITDA margin of 19.7%. Carve-out process on track. (Full consolidation since March 10  2022 ‚Äì Unaudited figures) On March 10  2022  Wendel acquired ACAMS  a global leader in professional education and training for anti-financial crime (AFC) professionals. ACAMS reported 2022 revenue of $98.4 million16  up +15.4% vs. the same period in 2021. Organic growth was +15.9%  and the impact of foreign exchange was -0.5%. Year-over-year growth was driven by conference recovery and greater sales of Certifications  Memberships and Training  especially to large bank customers across the globe. 2022 revenue growth benefited from the increasing regulatory activity amidst the recent geopolitical turmoil. At the end of December 2022  ACAMS‚Äô global membership base reached 103k  a +12% increase compared to December 2021. In Q4 2022  ACAMS launched the Certified Cryptoasset Anti-Financial Crime Specialist (CCAS) credential to mitigate the illicit-finance risks associated with blockchain technology for anti-financial crime professionals engaged with the virtual-asset sector. As of December 31  2022  EBITDA17 pro forma for the carve-out was c. $19.4 million  resulting in a pro forma margin of 19.7%. ACAMS is targeting go-forward EBITDA margin in excess of 20%. As of December 31  2022  net debt totaled $143.4 million18  which represents 5.9x EBITDA as defined in ACAMS‚Äô credit agreement. ACAMS‚Äô cash flow generation was impacted by one-time expenditures related to the carve-out  but ACAMS is expected to deliver cash conversion above 75% on a run-rate basis.19 ACAMS‚Äô separation from its prior parent company is nearly complete is expected to be finalized during the first half of 2023. Tarkett ‚Äì Sustained sales growth driven by Sport and price increases despite volume slowdown in the 4th quarter. Improved adjusted EBITDA due to positive inflation balance in 2022. (Equity method) In 2022 Tarkett totaled ‚Ç¨3 359 million in net sales  up by +20.3% compared to 2021. Organic growth reached +8.9%  or +11.7% including sales price increases in the CIS countries implemented to counter the inflation in purchasing costs (price adjustments in the CIS are historically excluded from organic growth to offset currency movements). The effect of sales price increases implemented across all segments is +11.7% on average in 2022 compared to 2021. Volumes were stable for the year. Record activity in Sport and growth in the commercial segments in North America offset the slowdown in the CIS and residential segments. The foreign exchange impact made a positive contribution  particularly thanks to the strengthening of the dollar against the euro. Adjusted EBITDA was ‚Ç¨234.9 million  or 7.0% of revenue  compared to ‚Ç¨229 million in 2021  or 8.2% of revenue. Inflation in raw materials  energy and transport is unprecedented. It was ‚Ç¨268 million and was accompanied by tensions on the supply of certain raw materials in the first part of the year. Tarkett successfully implemented sales price increases throughout the year achieving a favorable effect of ‚Ç¨327 million compared to 2021  resulting in a positive inflation balance of ‚Ç¨59 million  beyond the initial inflation neutralization target. Although volumes were broadly constant  the product mix deteriorated and had a negative effect on profitability. Industrial productivity was ‚Ç¨13 million  lower than expected  mainly due to lower business volumes. It therefore only partially compensated for the increase in salaries and overheads. Working capital requirement was ‚Ç¨233 million at the end of December 2022  compared to ‚Ç¨90 million at the end of December 2021  a historically low level. Inventories have increased due to inflation  growing activities  and the need to replenish inventories of raw materials and certain finished products in an environment with supply difficulties  and in value due to inflation. Tarkett generated a negative free cash flow for the year of ‚Äê‚Ç¨148.3 million  down from 2021 (‚Ç¨19.5 million)  impacted by the significant increase in working capital requirement. Free cash flow generation was particularly significant in the fourth quarter thanks to inventory reduction actions. Net financial debt was ‚Ç¨655 million at the end of December 2022  compared with ‚Ç¨476 million at the end of December 2021  including an increase of ‚Ç¨20 million related to the currency effect on dollar‚Äêdenominated debt. Debt leverage stands at 2.8x adjusted EBITDA at the end of December 2022. Tarkett had a good amount of liquidity  ‚Ç¨479 million  at the end of 2022 comprising the undrawn RCF in an amount of ‚Ç¨215 million  other confirmed and unconfirmed credit lines in an amount of ‚Ç¨44 million and ‚Ç¨221 million in cash. 2023 Outlook (published on February 15th): The macroeconomic environment will continue to impact the level of demand in 2023  particularly due to the level of inflation and interest rate rises. The geopolitical situation in Russia and Ukraine is having a significant impact on demand in the region‚Äôs main markets. In Russia  where Tarkett generated approximately 9% of its revenue in 2022 (based on average exchange rates in 2022)  Tarkett observed an approximately 25% lower of business volume than in 2021. In this context  Tarkett has taken immediate steps to reduce discretionary spending. At the same time  actions to reduce the cost structure are being implemented in the regions most affected by the slowdown in activity. Tarkett is also implementing all necessary measures to reduce debt leverage. The level of activity in the factories has been significantly reduced in order to adapt the level of production to demand and to reduce inventories in areas where sales volumes are slowing down. Structural measures to simplify product ranges and optimize inventory management are also contributing to the control of working capital requirement. Investments will be made selectively  the level of capital expenditure will be limited to ‚Ç¨90 million.

(""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (Euronext Amsterdam: PHARM) (Nasdaq: PHAR) presents its preliminary (unaudited) financial report for the full year ended December 31  2022.Chief Executive Officer  Sijmen de Vries commented:""2022 was a pivotal year for Pharming. It was a year in which we prioritized our efforts in rare diseases and affirmed our commitment to our purpose of serving the unserved rare disease patient. It is this priority and commitment that forms the foundation as we build Pharming into a leading  global rare disease company across multiple geographies  with multiple products  a well-defined pipeline and with the necessary commercial infrastructure in place to enhance our future ambition.Beginning in early 2022  we put into motion a bold strategy and made significant regulatory progress in advancing leniolisib towards marketing approval. In the U.S. and Europe  dossiers were filed and validated  with plans for the U.K. filing in the second half of 2023 remaining on track.We also announced positive Phase 3 clinical trial data for leniolisib with our findings published in Blood  the peer reviewed international medical journal of the American Society of Hematology. This was followed by the presentation of positive interim analysis data from the open label extension study at the 64th American Society Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting.In preparation for the FDA PDUFA goal date of March 29 in the U.S.  and to ensure commercial success with what will be our second marketed product  Pharming began investing significantly in its commercial infrastructure both in the U.S. and Europe from the third quarter. With this ramp up of commercial capabilities  we feel we are well positioned to successfully commercialize leniolisib in the U.S. shortly after receiving a positive decision. Looking to Europe  having those commercial capabilities already in place will be vital to executing our launch strategy following a positive CHMP opinion expected in the second half of 2023 and marketing authorisation expected approximately two months later.To support leniolisib and our broader growth ambitions in the rare disease space  we will continue advancing our pipeline via internal projects  as well as through potential in-licensing or acquisitions. The focus of these potential opportunities would target rare disease assets in mid to-late stage development  including assets with a clinical-proof-of-concept where we feel comfortable taking Phase III clinical risk. Internally  our focus will be additional indications for leniolisib  as well as the advancement of OTL-105 for the treatment of HAE.With a clear foundation laid  and a great start to our strategic execution  we have much to be proud of in 2022. I would like to thank our employees  our partners and suppliers and all of those who worked tirelessly to make this year such a success. We look forward to continuing to execute on our strategic objectives in 2023 as we follow through on Pharming's vision to become a leading  global rare disease company.""Strategic highlightsIn 2022  we prioritized our efforts on rare diseases and executed on a number of our strategic objectives to help build a sustainable global rare disease business focused on RUCONEST¬Æ sales  the approval  launch and commercialization of leniolisib for activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3KŒ¥) syndrome (APDS) in key markets  and the ongoing development and management of our pipeline.We significantly expanded our organization and headcount in 2022  especially in the second half of the year when we added commercial and medical affairs personnel to support market development and to prepare for the anticipated launch and commercialization of leniolisib for APDS. These investments are in line with our strategy to become a global  multi-product  rare disease company.In line with our renewed focus on rare diseases  we are advancing the development of our pipeline through a combination of internal development projects - including the development of additional indications for leniolisib  as well as OTL-105 as a gene therapy for HAE - and the potential acquisition or in-licensing of mid to late-stage assets.Investments in our internal pipeline projects and potential acquisitions and in-licensing will be financed through a combination of positive cash flow from the RUCONEST¬Æ business  anticipated future leniolisib business  and available cash from our strong balance sheet. If required  Pharming may access additional funding from the capital markets.Leniolisib development and commercializationFor leniolisib  Pharming has a three-step approach planned for the coming years.The first step is the anticipated regulatory approval and commercial launch of leniolisib for the treatment of activated PI3K delta syndrome (APDS) in adults and adolescents aged 12 and older in the U.S. during the first half of 2023. This will be followed by key markets in the European Economic Area (EEA) and the U.K.  subject to an anticipated positive CHMP opinion in the second half of 2023. The Company currently plans to pursue regulatory approvals in Japan  Canada  and Australia  and will evaluate additional countries and regions for product expansion  and will commercialize the product either directly or through strategic distribution partnerships.The second step includes clinical development and regulatory approvals to expand the marketing of leniolisib as a treatment for APDS to children as young as one year of age.The third step is the development of leniolisib in additional indications beyond APDS. Prioritization and preclinical testing work is ongoing and we expect to announce further details on our plans to develop leniolisib in additional indications in the second half of 2023.Leniolisib clinical dataIn February 2022  Pharming announced positive results from the pivotal Phase II/III blinded randomized  placebo-controlled registration-enabling study of leniolisib for the treatment of APDS in adults and adolescents aged 12 years or older. Data from this trial was presented at the Clinical Immunology Society 2022 Annual Meeting in April 2022 and published in Blood  the peer-reviewed international medical journal of the American Society of Hematology  in December 2022. Also in December 2022  positive interim analysis data from the open-label extension study evaluating leniolisib as a treatment for adult and adolescent patients 12 years or older with APDS was shared in an oral presentation at the 64th American Society Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting.Addressable global market opportunitiesPharming believes there are more than 1 500 patients with APDS living in the United States  Europe  Japan  Australia  Canada  and Israel. This figure is based on current populations and available literature which estimates the prevalence of the disease to be approximately 1 to 2 patients per million.To date  we have identified more than 500 patients with a confirmed APDS diagnosis in the countries where we intend to initially commercialize leniolisib. These patients have been found through the efforts of our disease educators and patient finders  as well as through our genetic testing partnership with Invitae  which offers free of charge genetic testing to US-based clinicians who believe they may have a patient with APDS. A genetic test enables a clinician to confirm their clinical suspicions and definitively diagnose APDS.U.S. marketIn 2022  the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted for priority review Pharming's New Drug Application (NDA) for leniolisib to treat adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older with APDS. The FDA assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date of March 29  2023. We currently remain on track for the FDA decision on leniolisib  followed by the anticipated commercial launch in the second quarter of 2023.In anticipation of a positive decision by the FDA  in the second half of 2022 we grew our US commercial infrastructure  including our field force  and leveraged our marketing capabilities to prepare for the successful commercialization of leniolisib.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) added a new diagnosis for APDS to the International Classification of Diseases  10th Revision  Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM)  formally recognizing APDS as a discrete immunological disease. The diagnosis code  D81.82 ‚Äí Activated Phosphoinositide 3-kinase Delta Syndrome (APDS)  took effect on October 1  2022. The assignment of the ICD-10-CM code by the CDC enables physicians and payors in the U.S. to add a diagnosis of APDS to patients' health records  which will help connect these individuals with researchers studying the prevalence and course of the disease. In addition  by allocating a specific diagnosis  the new ICD-10-CM code may help confirm medical necessity in individual patients  thus improving their access to relevant care options through U.S. health insurance plans.EEA and U.K. marketIn the EEA  Pharming submitted a marketing authorisation application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for leniolisib as a treatment for APDS in adults and adolescents aged 12 and older. Our dossier was filed and validated by EMA in October 2022 under the accelerated assessment timetable.In February 2023  Pharming Group announced that the EMA's Committee for Human Medicinal Products (CHMP) decided to shift its assessment of the MAA for leniolisib to a standard review timetable. The list of questions received by Pharming from EMA included a request to submit updated data from the ongoing long-term extension study collected after the interim analysis included in the original MAA. We anticipate that the CHMP will issue its opinion on the leniolisib MAA in the second half of 2023 and expect European marketing authorisation approximately two months later.In the U.K. and in line with the European Commission Decision Reliance Procedure (ECDRP)  we intend to file the leniolisib dossier to the U.K.'s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) within five days of a positive CHMP opinion; expected in the second half of 2023.The U.K. government has extended the ECDRP until December 31  2023.JapanIn line with our strategy to expand the reach of our products to rare disease patients  on March 9  2023 we filed an Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) application with the Ministry of Health  Labor and Welfare (MHLW) in Japan. We expect to begin a clinical trial in Japan in second quarter of 2023 for APDS patients aged 12 and older. We currently anticipate marketing leniolisib in Japan directly following regulatory approval.Pediatric clinical developmentPharming has developed a clinical plan to include children as young as one year of age who are afflicted with APDS. During the first half of 2022  positive decisions were received from EMA and the U.K.'s MHRA on the Pediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) for leniolisib as a treatment for APDS in children younger than 12 years of age.In April 2022  the MHRA granted Promising Innovative Medicine (PIM) designation to leniolisib for the treatment of APDS. A PIM designation is an early indication that leniolisib is a candidate for the MHRA's Early Access to Medicines Scheme. This scheme provides an opportunity for treatment options to be used in clinical practice in parallel with the later stages of the regulatory process.The leniolisib PIP includes two planned global clinical trials in pediatric patients with APDS to support regulatory filings worldwide.In February 2023  Pharming announced that the first patient had been enrolled in its Phase III clinical trial evaluating leniolisib in children aged 4 to 11 with APDS at sites in the United States  Europe  and Japan.Leniolisib for additional indications (PI3KŒ¥ technology platform)As we continue to work towards regulatory approvals of leniolisib for APDS in the United States  Europe and the United Kingdom  we have also commenced working towards prioritizing other indications where leniolisib has the potential to deliver value for patients. PI3KŒ¥ has been identified as an important player in a variety of disease states  and leniolisib has demonstrated an attractive  long-term efficacy  safety and tolerability profile in clinical trials conducted in both healthy volunteers and patients. This provides a solid basis for our plans for the investigation and investment in further leniolisib indications Pre-Clinical PipelineOTL-105Pharming has an ongoing strategic collaboration with Orchard Therapeutics to research  develop  manufacture and commercialize OTL-105  a newly disclosed investigational ex vivo autologous hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene therapy for the treatment of hereditary angioedema (HAE). The program has made good progress developing the lentiviral vector to enhance C1-inhibitor expression and is now testing in preclinical HAE disease models. We anticipate providing further updates as we move towards preparing an Investigational New Drug (IND) filing.PompeWe are continuing the preclinical investigation of a next-generation alpha-glucosidase therapy for the treatment of Pompe disease  and are currently evaluating potential differentiating features of our product candidate in these preclinical studies. We expect to update the market on our findings in the second quarter of 2023.Discontinuation of non-rare disease assetsIn line with our strategic decision to focus on rare diseases  we announced at our half year financial results in August 2022 the discontinuation of development of recombinant human C1 esterase inhibitor (rhC1INH) for acute kidney injury (AKI) and pre-eclampsia (PE). In line with this decision  we also announce today that we have stopped further development in the large-scale production of rhC1INH through the use of our transgenic cattle herd program  and have stopped the ongoing Phase IIb clinical trial and we will no longer pursue other strategic options.RUCONEST¬Æ - marketed for the treatment of acute HAE attacksIn 2022  RUCONEST¬Æ returned to positive growth  achieving US$205.6 million in revenues and demonstrating the sustainability of our product for the treatment of acute HAE attacks  first commercialized in the United States in 2014.The United States accounted for the majority of worldwide revenues with US$200.1 million in 2022 compared to US$193.4 million in 2021. From the second quarter onward  we achieved quarter-on-quarter growth in the US market  both in volumes and revenues  reflecting the growing number of patients using RUCONEST¬Æ and physicians prescribing the medication.Revenues within Europe remained stable in spite of strong prophylactic and generic competition.While Pharming faces competition within the HAE market  the continued need for effective and reliable treatments for acute attacks  including breakthrough attacks in patients on prophylactic therapy  as well as RUCONEST¬Æ's distinct advantages as the only recombinant treatment that targets the root cause of HAE by replacing missing or dysfunctional C1-INH  allows for sustainability in RUCONEST¬Æ's revenues.Organizational highlightsPharming's headcount grew significantly in 2022. This growth was seen in commercial  medical and in back office support personnel in preparation for the launch and commercialization of leniolisib in key markets  most of which was in place at the tail end of the third quarter. Pharming will continue investing in its future by building the infrastructure to support the successful launch and commercialization of leniolisib and our other existing and future pipeline programs.Subsequent eventOn March 12 and 13  2023  Pharming issued three press releases regarding the events surrounding Silicon Valley Bank. Pharming confirms that it has full access to its deposits.Full Year 2022 Financial highlightsAmounts in US$m except per share data 2022 2021 % Change Income StatementRevenues 205.6 198.9 3 % Gross profit 188.1 177.7 6 % Operating profit 18.2 13.6 34 % Profit for the year 13.7 16.0 (14) % Balance SheetCash & marketable securities 208.7 193.0 8 % Share InformationBasic earnings per share (US$) 0.021 0.025 (16) % Diluted earnings per share (US$) 0.019 0.023 (17) %Financial ReviewIn 2022  Pharming's revenues increased by 3% to US$205.6 million and operating profit increased by 34% to US$18.2 million. Net profit decreased by 14% to US$13.7 million.This section will further elaborate on Pharming's financial performance in 2022.Revenues and Gross ProfitThe increase in revenues was primarily a result of higher sales of RUCONEST¬Æ in the U.S. market (US$200.1 million in 2022 compared to US$193.4 million in 2021)  which was supported by a price increase below CPI  as well as an increase in physicians prescribing and the number of patients using RUCONEST¬Æ.Revenues in Europe remained the same as last year at US$4.9 million in 2022. Revenue in the rest of the world  excluding Europe  increased to US$0.6 million from US$0.5 million in 2021.Cost of sales decreased by 17% from US$21.1 million in 2021 to US$17.6 million in 2022. Cost of sales related to product sales in 2022 amounted to US$17.4 million compared to US$19.1 million in 2021. The remainder of costs in 2022 (US$0.2 million) stem from impairment charges on inventory designated for commercial activities (2021: US$2.0 million).Gross profit increased by US$10.4 million  or 6%  to US$188.1 million for the year 2022. The main reasons for this increase were higher sales of RUCONEST¬Æ  a favorable currency translation effect and favorable production results.Operating Profit and Other Operating CostsFor 2022  the operating profit increased by US$4.6 million to US$18.2 million compared with US$13.6 million for the prior year. This increase was driven by increased gross profit (US$10.4 million) as mentioned above  increased other income (US$11.9 million) and offset by increased operating costs (US$17.6 million).Other income increased significantly by US$11.9 million in 2022 to US$14.5 million as compared to US$2.6 million in 2021 as Pharming reduced its minority stake in BioConnection from 43.85% to 22.98% in April 2022. As a result of this transaction  Pharming received one-off net cash proceeds of US$7.5 million and recognized a gain of US$12.2 million. This was partly offset by a decrease in government grants on R&D projects  due to Pharming's renewed strategy and pipeline.The operating costs for 2022 increased primarily from additional investments in leniolisib (development  medical affairs  commercial launch preparation). Furthermore  costs for the OTL-105 development increased and impairment costs were incurred from the discontinuation of the development of AKI and the cattle platform. Out of pocket costs of closed programs (Covid 19  PE  and AKI) were reduced versus the previous year.Financial income and expensesOther finance income decreased by US$10.4 million  to US$4.5 million for the year-end December 31  2022. This decrease was primarily caused by fluctuations in the U.S. Dollar versus Euro during 2021 and 2022. This had a particular impact on the bank balances due to our net cash position.During 2022  Pharming reduced its currency translation exposure causing the decrease of currency translation income in 2022 as compared to 2021.Other finance expenses decreased by US$0.7 million  from US$6.2 million for year-end December 31  2021 to US$5.5 million for the year ended December 31  2022  mainly caused by currency translation effects.The fair value loss on revaluation (US$1.2 million) relates to fair value adjustments in the BioConnection preference share which is included in Pharming's balance sheet as an investment in equity instruments designated at the Fair Value Through the Statement of Profit and Loss (FVTPL).Income tax expenseIncome tax expense decreased by US$5.8 million from US$7.1 million for the year ended December 31  2021 to US$1.3 million for the year ended December 31  2022  mainly due to the decrease in profit before tax and income from the BioConnection transaction  as mentioned above  being tax exempt.Profit for the yearA total net profit in 2022 of US$13.7 million represented a decrease of 14% over 2021 (US$16.0 million). The decrease was mainly caused by an increase in operating costs - due to company growth - investments in Pharming's product pipeline  decreasing foreign exchange gains and impairment charges on the cancelled downstream production facility. These increased costs were partly offset by an increase in revenues and other income.Intangible assetsIn 2022  intangible assets decreased by US$8.7 million from US$83.8 million in 2021 to US$75.1 million in 2022. The decrease was caused by regular amortization (US$4.3 million) and foreign currency effects (US$5.0 million)  and was partly offset by investments in assets (US$0.6 million).AmortizationThis relates to regular amortization of software and the re-acquired rights related to the acquisition of all North American commercialization rights from Bausch Health in 2016 and the acquisition of all European commercialization and distribution rights from Swedish Orphan International AB (""Sobi"") in 2020. Amortization is charged based on the economic lifetime of the intangible asset. The economic lifetime of the North American commercialization rights from Bausch Health is 20 years  where the economic lifetime of the European commercialization and distribution rights from Swedish Orphan International AB is 12 years. This estimate did not change compared to the previous year.InvestmentsInvestments in intangible assets relate to software. Assets acquired related to software (US$0.6 million) mainly relate to the improvements and updates to Pharming's ERP system SAP S/4HANA. The ERP system was implemented and operational as of January 1  2022 and amortized over five years  which is considered to be the expected economic lifetime.Property  plant and equipmentProperty  plant and equipment decreased from US$13.2 million for 2021 to US$10.4 million for 2022. The decrease was mainly caused by regular depreciation (US$2.6 million)  foreign currency effects US$0.7 million and impairments and divestment activities (US$0.9 million). These activities were related to assets designated to the development of rhC1INH therapy for Acute Kidney Injury  which was stopped.The decrease was partly offset by capital expenditures of US$1.4 million mainly relating to new machinery and equipment for Pharming's production process.Right-of-use assetsThe right-of-use assets increased by US$8.9 million to US$28.8 million for 2022 (2021: US$19.9 million). Investments of US$16.8 million in 2022  were primarily related to a new asset caused by the inception of the lease contract for the DSP facility at Pivot Park  Oss. As communicated in the prior year  as a result of our renewed strategic manufacturing partnership with long-term manufacturing partner Sanofi S.A.  Pharming decided to complete the construction of the new building  but will no longer pursue the realization of its own downstream production capacity at Pivot Park in Oss. During 2022 the lease commenced and resulted in an investment of US$14.6 million. Pharming is currently looking into possibilities for alternative use. As a result of aforementioned decision  the right-of-use asset was impaired for an amount of US$3.9 million. The remainder of the investments relate to investments in Pharming's lease car portfolio.The increase in the right-to-use assets are partly offset by regular depreciation (US$3.0 million) and foreign currency effects (US$0.8 million).InvestmentsInvestments increased by US$1.1 million to US$9.7 million at December 31  2022. This was caused by a decrease in investments accounted for using the equity method of US$4.7 million in 2022 from US$7.2 million at the end of the year in 2021  which resulted in a balance of US$2.5 million for the year ended December 31  2022. Next to this  a decrease was applicable in investments in debt instruments designated as at the Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income (FVTOCI) of US$1.0 million to US$0.4 million for the year ended December 31  2022 (2021: US$1.4 million). Finally  Pharming recognized a new investment in a debt instrument designated as at FVTPL (US$6.8 million).Investments accounted for using the equity methodThe asset relates to an investment in the ordinary shares of BioConnection Investments B.V.. During the second quarter of 2022  Pharming entered into a share purchase agreement  following receipt of an offer for all shares in BioConnection by Gimv  a European investment company listed on Euronext Brussels. The existing shareholders (including Pharming) reached an agreement with Gimv on the sale of all issued and outstanding shares to a new holding company (BioConnection Investments B.V.) incorporated by Gimv  followed by a partial re-investment by existing shareholders of the purchase price in the share capital of BioConnection Investments B.V. The re-investment relates to the purchase of ordinary shares and a preference share. The transaction diluted Pharming's stake in BioConnection from 43.85% in 2021 to 22.98% in 2022  which caused a decrease of US$3.0 millionAs a result of this transaction  Pharming received one-off net cash proceeds of US$7.5 million (EUR6.9 million) and recognized a gain of US$12.2 million.Furthermore  the remainder of the decrease was caused by the recognition of Pharming's share in the results of BioConnection and currency translation effects.Investment in debt instruments designated as at FVTPLThe asset relates to the preference share as obtained as part of the agreement referred to above relating to BioConnection Investments B.V. The fair value was calculated based on a commonly accepted valuation method  the option pricing model (""OPM""). As a result  Pharming recognized a fair value asset of US$7.9 million at inception date in Q2 2022. Management reassessed the fair value at December 31  2022  resulting in a decrease of the fair value of US$1.2 million.InventoriesInventories increased from US$27.3 million for the year ended December 31  2021 to US$42.3 million for the year ended December 31  2022. This was largely due to an increase in work in progress inventory.Cash and cash equivalentsCash and cash equivalents  together with restricted cash  increased to US$208.7 million at the year-end 2022  compared with US$193.0 million for the year ended December 31  2021. This was a result of positive cash flows from operating activities of US$22.9 million and positive cash flows generated from investing activities of US$5.3 million. This was offset by net cash flows used in financing activities of US$5.0 million and currency translation effect of US$7.8 million.EquityThe equity position increased by US$11.7 million from US$192.9 million for the year ended December 31  2021 to US$204.6 million for the year ended December 31  2022. This was mainly due to the changes in the net result achieved by Pharming (US$13.7 million) and transactions recognized directly in equity relating to share based compensation and exercised options (US$8.7 million)  and was partly offset by other comprehensive income relating to the currency translation reserve of US$10.4 million and fair value changes on investments designated as fair value with changes through other comprehensive income (US$0.7 million).Convertible bondThe convertible bond has decreased by US$7.5 million to US$133.4 million at year-end 2022  moving from US$140.9 million as of December 31  2021. This was mainly caused by foreign currency effects of US$8.3 million  which was partly offset by amortization of transactions costs (US$0.8 million). During 2022  a total of US$4.0 million of interest was paid on the bond.Lease liabilitiesLease liabilities increased by US$12.4 million from US$20.9 million as of 2021 to US$33.3 million per December 31  2022. The increase (US$16.2 million) was mainly due to new lease contracts for our DSP facility at Pivot Park  Oss in the Netherlands  inflation increases on lease prices for other facilities  and additions to the liability due to expansion of Pharming's car fleet. This was partly offset by monthly or quarterly lease payments (US$3.3 million). The remainder relates to regularly accrued interest expenses and foreign exchange effects.Outlook/SummaryFor 2023  the Company anticipates:Continued low single digit growth in annual revenues from RUCONEST¬Æ  with quarterly fluctuations expected.Subject to FDA approval in the U.S. for leniolisib  we plan to commercially launch leniolisib in 2Q 2023.We anticipate a positive CHMP opinion for leniolisib in 2H 2023.
