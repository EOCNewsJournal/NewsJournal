THE BOARD OF DIRECTOR´S PROPOSED RESOLUTIONS WITH RESPECT TO ITEMS 3  9 b AND 19-20Preparation and approval of the voting list (item 3)The voting list proposed for approval is the voting list drawn up by Euroclear Sweden AB on behalf of the Company  based on the Annual General Meeting’s register of shareholders  shareholders having given notice of participation and being present in the meeting room  and postal votes received.Appropriation of the Company’s profit pursuant to the adopted balance sheet (item 9 b)The Board of Directors proposes a dividend for the financial year 2022 of SEK 4.75 per share.The Board of Director proposes that the dividend should be disbursed in two instalments  with 24 April 2023 as record date for the first instalment of SEK 2.50 and 24 October 2023 as record date for the second instalment of SEK 2.25.If the Annual General Meeting resolves in accordance with the Board of Directors’ proposal  the estimated date for payment of the dividend from Euroclear Sweden AB to those who are recorded in the share register on the respective record date  is 27 April 2023 for the first instalment and 27 October 2023 for the second instalment.Resolution on the Board of Directors’ proposal to implement a long-term share based incentive program by (A) issuing call options for shares in Bufab  (B) authorising of the Board of Directors to resolve on acquisition of own shares and (C) transferring repurchased shares to participants of the Company’s incentive programs (item 19)Like previous years  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting 2023 resolves to adopt a long-term share based incentive program (the “Program”)  on terms and conditions in line with the 2022 incentive program. The Program  which is proposed to comprise approximately 30 key employees within the Bufab group  essentially involves that the participants are given the opportunity to acquire  at market price  call options relating to shares in Bufab AB (publ) (“Bufab” or the “Company”) repurchased by the Company and that participants who remain as employees within the group after three years and still hold call options may receive a subsidy in the form of gross salary additions corresponding to the premium paid for the call options held at the time of payment.Formally  the Program consists of (A) the issuing of call options for shares in Bufab  (B) an authorisation of the Board of Directors to resolve on acquisition of own shares and (C) transfer of repurchased shares to participants of the Company’s incentive programs in accordance with the following.(A) Resolution on issuing call options for shares in Bufaba) The number of call options to be issued shall not exceed 210 000  corresponding to approximately 0.6 per cent of the total number of shares and votes in the Company. Each call option entitles the holder to acquire one (1) repurchased share in the Company during the period from and including 15 May 2026 up to and including 15 November 2026. However  shares may not be purchased during any such period when trading in the Company’s shares is prohibited in accordance with regulation (EU) no 596/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014 on market abuse (the “market abuse regulation”) or any other equivalent legislation which applies at any given time.b) The purchase price for shares upon exercise of the call option shall correspond to 115 per cent of the volume-weighted average closing prices for the Company’s share on Nasdaq Stockholm during the five trading days before the Board of Directors’ resolution on allotment of call options.c) The right to acquire the call options shall be granted to the CEO of Bufab group  to senior executives and to other key employees within the group who are directly able to influence the group’s profit. The CEO shall be offered a maximum of 30 000 call options. Other participants are divided into two categories depending on seniority  each comprising approximately 15 persons  who shall be offered a maximum of 10 000 and 5 000 call options  respectively  per person.d) If a participant refrains in full or in part from acquiring offered call options  such un-acquired call options shall be allocated on a pro rata basis between those participants who have  in writing  expressed their interest in acquiring additional call options. Participants are not entitled in this manner to acquire more than an additional 30 per cent of the original number of call options offered.e) The call options shall be allotted against payment in accordance with the Board of Directors’ resolution to the CEO  senior executives and other key employees within the Bufab group  in accordance with the guidelines stated in items c) and d) above. Allotment is expected to take place during the second or third quarter 2023.f) Allotment of call options according to item e) shall be made at market value calculated by Ernst & Young AB as an independent valuation institute  applying the Black & Scholes valuation method. The calculation is based on the variables risk-free interest rate  volatility  the term of the call options  expected dividends during the term of the call options  current share price and the acquisition price for shares when exercising the call options (strike price). Since the call options are acquired at market price  no criteria for allocation in the Program are established.g) The issuance of call options to employees outside of Sweden is dependent on tax effects  that there is no legal impediment  and that the Board of Directors determines that such allocation can be carried out with reasonable administrative and financial resources. The Board of Directors shall be entitled to make such minor amendments to the Program as required by applicable foreign legislation and regulations.h) The call options are freely transferable.i) The number of shares which the call options bring entitlement to acquire  as well as the exercise price  may be recalculated as a result of e.g. bonus issues  revers splits or splits of shares  new share issues  a reduction of the share capital  or similar actions. The time of transfer of shares may be brought forward as a result of any merger or similar actions.j) In order to encourage participation in the Program  the Board of Directors is authorised to resolve on a subsidy in the form of gross salary additions  maximum corresponding to the premium paid for each call option. In such cases  the subsidy will be paid in June 2026  subject to the participant at such point in time is remaining in his/her employment or another corresponding employment within the Bufab group and still holding call options. If a participant has disposed a part of its call options  the participant should receive a subsidy maximum corresponding to the premium paid for the call options held by the participant at the time of payment.k) The Company has the right but not any obligation to  on its own or through a third party  repurchase call options at a price corresponding to no more than the market value  with the purpose of facilitating the participant's exercise of the remaining call options acquired under the Program. However  call options may not be repurchased during any such period when trading in the Company’s shares is prohibited in accordance with Article 19 of the market abuse regulation or any other equivalent legislation which applies at any given time.l) The Board of Directors shall  within the framework of the above terms and conditions  be responsible for the preparation and management of the Program.(B) Resolution on authorisation of the Board of Directors to resolve on repurchase of own sharesIn order to hedge Bufab’s delivery of shares to the participants of the Program  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to authorise the Board of Directors to acquire  during the period until the next Annual General Meeting  a maximum of 210 000 shares in the Company. Acquisition shall be made on Nasdaq Stockholm in accordance with stock exchange regulations at a price within the registered price interval from time to time  which is the interval between the highest purchase price and the lowest sale price. Acquired shares shall be paid in cash and acquisitions may be made on one or several occasions.(C) Resolution on transfer of repurchased shares to participants of the Company’s incentive programsThe Board of Directors’ proposal also implies that the Annual General Meeting approves that the Company  with deviation from the shareholders’ preferential right  transfer a maximum of 210 000 of the Company’s repurchased shares to the participants of the Program at the fixed exercise price (subject to any recalculation). Transfer shall take place during the time the participants have the right to exercise call options to acquire shares in accordance with the terms and conditions for the Program. The reason for deviation from the shareholders’ preferential right at transfer of own shares is to enable Bufab to deliver shares in the Company to the participants of the Program.Shares that have been acquired by the Company  and which are not transferred to participants in the Program may be transferred to participants in previous incentive programs or future incentive programs decided on by the General Meeting of the Company. Also such shares acquired by the Company within previous years' incentive programs may be transferred to participants in the Program  previous incentive programs or future incentive programs decided on by the General Meeting. Transfer shall take place in accordance with applicable rules for the current incentive program.Dilution  costs and impact on important key ratiosThe Program does not cause any dilution of the existing shareholders’ share of the votes and capital in the Company since it is based on call options for shares already issued by the Company. The Program corresponds to approximately 0.6 per cent of the total number of shares and votes in the Company. Based on actual participation in the 2020  2021 and 2022 incentive programs  these programs correspond  together with the Program proposed for the Annual General Meeting 2023  to a total of 1.6 per cent of the total number of shares and votes in the Company.The costs of the Program consist of the subsidy that during June 2026 may be paid as per the above  the social security charges payable on this subsidy and the financing costs for repurchased shares. The total cost has been estimated to approximately MSEK 12 after corporation tax over the duration of the Program. To be compared with the subsidy  the option premium which the Company will receive on transfer of the call options corresponds to a total of approximately MSEK 11.During its duration  the Program will impact the key ratio earnings per share positively through the Company’s repurchase of shares and negatively because of the Company’s transfer of the repurchased shares to the participants in the Program. The net effect on the key ratio earnings per share will be maximum 0.6% during the duration of the Program. The cost for the Company’s repurchase of own shares is estimated to amount to approximately MSEK 60 and will affect the cash flow  liquidity and equity in connection with the repurchase during the duration of the Program. After the duration of the Program  the above effects are expected to be neutralised. The Program is considered to only result in immaterial impact on other important key ratios.Reason for the Program and its preparationSince 2017  the Company has  after a resolution by the Annual General Meeting each year  implemented a yearly recurring long-term incentive program comprising call options  on terms and conditions in all material aspects corresponding to the proposed Program. In the Board of Directors’ assessment  the previously resolved incentive programs have so far fulfilled their purposes. Therefore  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting 2023 resolves on a corresponding incentive program. The reason for implementing the Program is that key employees within the Bufab group should be able to benefit from and strive for  through their own investment  an increase in the price of the Company’s shares  thus more closely aligning the interests of key employees and the Company’s shareholders. The purposes of the Program is also to contribute towards key employees increasing their long-term shareholding in Bufab. The Program is also expected to create conditions for retaining and recruiting competent personnel for the Bufab group  to provide competitive remuneration and to align the interest of the executive management and shareholders. The Board of Directors considers that the Program is reasonable in scope and cost effective. The key employees included in the Program is the group of persons that  in an otherwise heavily decentralised organisation  can create positive effects for the Bufab group. On the basis of this  the Board of Directors believes that the Program has a positive effect on the continued development of the Bufab-group  and that the Program benefits both the shareholders and the Company.The proposal for the Program has been prepared by the Company’s Remuneration Committee in consultation with the Board of Directors of the Company. The Company’s management has not been involved in the preparation. The resolution to propose the Program to the Annual General Meeting has been taken by the Board of Directors. Members of the Board of the Company are not included in the Program.Majority requirementThe Board of Directors’ proposal pursuant to items 19 (A) – (C) above shall be resolved on as one resolution with application of the majority rules in Chapter 16 of the Swedish Companies Act  meaning that shareholders representing at least nine-tenths of both the votes cast and shares represented at the meeting must support the resolution.Resolution on authorization to transfer shares in the Company (item 20)The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorizes the Board of Directors to  on one or more occasions during the period up until the next Annual General Meeting  resolve upon transfer of the Company’s own shares according to the following terms.The maximum number of shares to be transferred may not exceed the number of own shares held by the Company at the time of the Board of Directors’ resolution  provided that the Company always holds such a number of shares that the Company needs to ensure delivery of shares under the Company's ongoing call option-based incentive programs (including any recalculation).Transfer of the Company’s own shares may only take place on Nasdaq Stockholm at a price within the share price interval registered at each point in time  meaning the interval between the highest purchase price and the lowest selling price.The purpose of the authorization is to enable the Company to transfer such shares that the Company has repurchased in order to ensure delivery of shares within the framework of one of the Company’s call option-based incentive programs  but which  partly as a result of the structure of the incentive programs  have not been used for delivery of shares to participants in such incentive programs.The resolution by the meeting requires the support of shareholders representing at least two thirds of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the meeting.E. NUMBER OF SHARES AND VOTES IN THE COMPANYAt the time of the issue of this convening notice  the total number of shares in the Company amounts to 38 110 533 shares corresponding to 38 110 533 votes in total. Of these shares  381 363 are held in treasury and may not be represented at the Annual General Meeting.F. RIGHT TO REQUEST INFORMATIONThe Board of Directors and the CEO shall  upon request of a shareholder  and if the Board of Directors deems this can be done without causing material harm to the Company  inform about matters which might affect the assessment of an item on the agenda or about Bufab´s or its subsidiaries´ financial situation or about Bufab´s relation to another group entity in relation to the consolidated financial statements.G.

Resolution (t)Performance share plan for the senior managementThe Board of Directors has reviewed remuneration for the senior management and concluded that the Company would benefit from a continuation of a performance share plan that complements the stock option plan to further increase the senior management's alignment with long-term shareholder value creation. The Board proposes that the 2023 Annual General Meeting resolves to approve the Board of Directors' proposal regarding a performance share plan to the senior management in Kindred Group which will be used in conjunction with the existing stock option plan (SOP).In the proposed plan  the performance measure is a non-market based condition that provides participants (approximately 109) with a high degree of alignment to Company performance. PSP awards will depend on Kindred achieving financial performance target (i.e. EBITDA) over three financial years establishing a clearer link between how Kindred performs and the value that the PSP can deliver.The suggested performance share plan may in total comprise no more than 0 3% of all issued shares in Kindred annually  and on an accumulated basis the five plans of 2023-2027 will amount to around 1 1% of dilution.Closing of the meetingInformation about proposals related to Agenda itemsAgenda item 2The Nomination Committee will publish the information of its proposal for a Chairman of the AGM 2023 on a later date.Agenda item 8The Board of Directors proposes a dividend of GBP 0.345  which is approximately SEK 4.35 at the exchange rate 12.63 GBP/SEK at 28 February 2023 per SDR/share  to be paid to holders of ordinary shares/ SDRs.

Should any of these shareholders appoint the Chairman of the Board of Directors to the Nomination Committee  the Nomination Committee shall consist of five members. Otherwise  the Chairman of the Board shall be adjunct to the Nomination Committee. The other members shall be appointed by each of the subsequent largest shareholders expressing their willingness to participate in the Nomination Committee  within one week after they have been so asked. At the appointment of a member to the Nomination Committee  it shall be stated which shareholder that has appointed the member in question. Should a shareholder waive its right to appoint a member to the Nomination Committee  the opportunity to appoint a member shall be passed to the following largest shareholder which has already not appointed a member to the Nomination Committee.The members of the Nomination Committee shall appoint the committee chair among themselves. The Chairman of the Board shall not chair the Nomination Committee. The names of the members of the Nomination Committee shall be announced no later than the date of the publication of the Company's interim report for the third quarter of 2023.Should the ownership in the Company change  after the announcement of the Nomination Committee but before the end of the fourth quarter of 2023  to such an extent that the members of the Nomination Committee no longer reflect the shareholding structure as stipulated above  and the Nomination Committee so considers appropriate  the member of the Nomination Committee representing the shareholder with the lesser number of shares in the Company shall resign from the committee and the shareholder who has become the larger shareholder in the Company shall  in the order corresponding to its shareholding in the Company  be offered to appoint a new member to the Nomination Commit-tee.

However  the Nomination Committee shall have the right to engage outside expertise and consultancy services related to its assignments and to ensure their reimbursement by the Company.Agenda item 24Acquisition of Own SharesThe Board of Directors proposes that the acquisition of shares/SDRs shall take place on Nasdaq Stockholm or via an offer to acquire the shares/SDRs to all shareholders. The purchases may take place on multiple occasions and will be based on actual market price and terms  prevailing regulations and the capital situation at any given time. Notification of any purchase will be made to Nasdaq Stockholm and details will appear in the Company's annual report and accounts.The objective of the purchase is to achieve added value for the Company's shareholders (including through the implementation of the share buy-back program previously announced)1 and to give the Board increased flexibility with the Company's capital structure.Following the purchase  the intention of the Board would be to either cancel  use as consideration for an acquisition or issue to employees under a Share Option programme or Share Performance Scheme.Once purchased under the Maltese Companies Act further shareholder approval will be required before those shares could be cancelled only. Shares/SDRs bought back pursuant to the Company's share buy-back program will be cancelled (refer to Agenda item 26). A separate authorisation for such cancellation is being recommended pursuant to Resolution (s).If used as consideration for an acquisition  the intention would be that the actual shares/SDRs would be offered to any potential transferor.Agenda item 25Share cancellationThe directors may decide to cancel all or some of shares/SDRs acquired pursuant to the buy-back program.The Companies Act (Cap. 386 of the laws of Malta) stipulates that an extraordinary resolution of the shareholders of the Company is required in order to approve the reduction in the issued share capital of the Company.Such resolution needs to be filed with the Registrar of Companies in Malta  who will publish details of such reduction. Creditors of the Company will then have a period of three months during which they can contest the reduction in capital. Upon the lapse of the three-month period  assuming that no contestations are received  the reduction in share capital can become effective.In order to reflect the changes in the issued share capital  a revised memorandum of association of the Company indicating the reduced number of shares then in issue in the capital of the Company will need to be submitted to the Registrar of Companies.The reduction in issued share capital will take place at such intervals and in such amounts (subject to the maximum amount of GBP 14 375) as the directors shall determine from time to time.Agenda item 26Share issueThe objectives of the authorisation to be granted in terms of this resolution are to increase the financial flexibility of the Company and to enable the Company to use its own financial instruments for payment in kind or through a set-off to a selling partner in connection with any business acquisitions the Company may undertake or to settle any deferred payments in connection with business acquisitions. The market value of the shares/SDRs on each issue date that will be used in determining the price at which shares/SDRs will be issued  should be the same as the market value of the shares/SDRs listed on Nasdaq Stockholm. A cap of 23 million ordinary shares/SDRs in the Company is being requested in connection with this authorisation. The cap will be reduced by the amount of any shares/SDRs bought back and held by the Company excluding however any shares/SDRs held by the Company from the said calculation.Agenda item 27Performance share plan for the senior managementThe Board of Directors has reviewed remuneration for the senior management and concluded that the Company would benefit from a continuation of a performance share plan that complements the stock option plan to further increase the senior management's alignment with long-term shareholder value creation.

THE BOARD OF DIRECTOR´S PROPOSED RESOLUTIONS WITH RESPECT TO ITEMS 3  9 b AND 19-20Preparation and approval of the voting list (item 3)The voting list proposed for approval is the voting list drawn up by Euroclear Sweden AB on behalf of the Company  based on the Annual General Meeting’s register of shareholders  shareholders having given notice of participation and being present in the meeting room  and postal votes received.Appropriation of the Company’s profit pursuant to the adopted balance sheet (item 9 b)The Board of Directors proposes a dividend for the financial year 2022 of SEK 4.75 per share.The Board of Director proposes that the dividend should be disbursed in two instalments  with 24 April 2023 as record date for the first instalment of SEK 2.50 and 24 October 2023 as record date for the second instalment of SEK 2.25.If the Annual General Meeting resolves in accordance with the Board of Directors’ proposal  the estimated date for payment of the dividend from Euroclear Sweden AB to those who are recorded in the share register on the respective record date  is 27 April 2023 for the first instalment and 27 October 2023 for the second instalment.Resolution on the Board of Directors’ proposal to implement a long-term share based incentive program by (A) issuing call options for shares in Bufab  (B) authorising of the Board of Directors to resolve on acquisition of own shares and (C) transferring repurchased shares to participants of the Company’s incentive programs (item 19)Like previous years  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting 2023 resolves to adopt a long-term share based incentive program (the “Program”)  on terms and conditions in line with the 2022 incentive program. The Program  which is proposed to comprise approximately 30 key employees within the Bufab group  essentially involves that the participants are given the opportunity to acquire  at market price  call options relating to shares in Bufab AB (publ) (“Bufab” or the “Company”) repurchased by the Company and that participants who remain as employees within the group after three years and still hold call options may receive a subsidy in the form of gross salary additions corresponding to the premium paid for the call options held at the time of payment.Formally  the Program consists of (A) the issuing of call options for shares in Bufab  (B) an authorisation of the Board of Directors to resolve on acquisition of own shares and (C) transfer of repurchased shares to participants of the Company’s incentive programs in accordance with the following.(A) Resolution on issuing call options for shares in Bufaba) The number of call options to be issued shall not exceed 210 000  corresponding to approximately 0.6 per cent of the total number of shares and votes in the Company. Each call option entitles the holder to acquire one (1) repurchased share in the Company during the period from and including 15 May 2026 up to and including 15 November 2026. However  shares may not be purchased during any such period when trading in the Company’s shares is prohibited in accordance with regulation (EU) no 596/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014 on market abuse (the “market abuse regulation”) or any other equivalent legislation which applies at any given time.b) The purchase price for shares upon exercise of the call option shall correspond to 115 per cent of the volume-weighted average closing prices for the Company’s share on Nasdaq Stockholm during the five trading days before the Board of Directors’ resolution on allotment of call options.c) The right to acquire the call options shall be granted to the CEO of Bufab group  to senior executives and to other key employees within the group who are directly able to influence the group’s profit. The CEO shall be offered a maximum of 30 000 call options. Other participants are divided into two categories depending on seniority  each comprising approximately 15 persons  who shall be offered a maximum of 10 000 and 5 000 call options  respectively  per person.d) If a participant refrains in full or in part from acquiring offered call options  such un-acquired call options shall be allocated on a pro rata basis between those participants who have  in writing  expressed their interest in acquiring additional call options. Participants are not entitled in this manner to acquire more than an additional 30 per cent of the original number of call options offered.e) The call options shall be allotted against payment in accordance with the Board of Directors’ resolution to the CEO  senior executives and other key employees within the Bufab group  in accordance with the guidelines stated in items c) and d) above. Allotment is expected to take place during the second or third quarter 2023.f) Allotment of call options according to item e) shall be made at market value calculated by Ernst & Young AB as an independent valuation institute  applying the Black & Scholes valuation method. The calculation is based on the variables risk-free interest rate  volatility  the term of the call options  expected dividends during the term of the call options  current share price and the acquisition price for shares when exercising the call options (strike price). Since the call options are acquired at market price  no criteria for allocation in the Program are established.g) The issuance of call options to employees outside of Sweden is dependent on tax effects  that there is no legal impediment  and that the Board of Directors determines that such allocation can be carried out with reasonable administrative and financial resources. The Board of Directors shall be entitled to make such minor amendments to the Program as required by applicable foreign legislation and regulations.h) The call options are freely transferable.i) The number of shares which the call options bring entitlement to acquire  as well as the exercise price  may be recalculated as a result of e.g. bonus issues  revers splits or splits of shares  new share issues  a reduction of the share capital  or similar actions. The time of transfer of shares may be brought forward as a result of any merger or similar actions.j) In order to encourage participation in the Program  the Board of Directors is authorised to resolve on a subsidy in the form of gross salary additions  maximum corresponding to the premium paid for each call option. In such cases  the subsidy will be paid in June 2026  subject to the participant at such point in time is remaining in his/her employment or another corresponding employment within the Bufab group and still holding call options. If a participant has disposed a part of its call options  the participant should receive a subsidy maximum corresponding to the premium paid for the call options held by the participant at the time of payment.k) The Company has the right but not any obligation to  on its own or through a third party  repurchase call options at a price corresponding to no more than the market value  with the purpose of facilitating the participant's exercise of the remaining call options acquired under the Program. However  call options may not be repurchased during any such period when trading in the Company’s shares is prohibited in accordance with Article 19 of the market abuse regulation or any other equivalent legislation which applies at any given time.l) The Board of Directors shall  within the framework of the above terms and conditions  be responsible for the preparation and management of the Program.(B) Resolution on authorisation of the Board of Directors to resolve on repurchase of own sharesIn order to hedge Bufab’s delivery of shares to the participants of the Program  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to authorise the Board of Directors to acquire  during the period until the next Annual General Meeting  a maximum of 210 000 shares in the Company. Acquisition shall be made on Nasdaq Stockholm in accordance with stock exchange regulations at a price within the registered price interval from time to time  which is the interval between the highest purchase price and the lowest sale price. Acquired shares shall be paid in cash and acquisitions may be made on one or several occasions.(C) Resolution on transfer of repurchased shares to participants of the Company’s incentive programsThe Board of Directors’ proposal also implies that the Annual General Meeting approves that the Company  with deviation from the shareholders’ preferential right  transfer a maximum of 210 000 of the Company’s repurchased shares to the participants of the Program at the fixed exercise price (subject to any recalculation). Transfer shall take place during the time the participants have the right to exercise call options to acquire shares in accordance with the terms and conditions for the Program. The reason for deviation from the shareholders’ preferential right at transfer of own shares is to enable Bufab to deliver shares in the Company to the participants of the Program.Shares that have been acquired by the Company  and which are not transferred to participants in the Program may be transferred to participants in previous incentive programs or future incentive programs decided on by the General Meeting of the Company. Also such shares acquired by the Company within previous years' incentive programs may be transferred to participants in the Program  previous incentive programs or future incentive programs decided on by the General Meeting. Transfer shall take place in accordance with applicable rules for the current incentive program.Dilution  costs and impact on important key ratiosThe Program does not cause any dilution of the existing shareholders’ share of the votes and capital in the Company since it is based on call options for shares already issued by the Company. The Program corresponds to approximately 0.6 per cent of the total number of shares and votes in the Company. Based on actual participation in the 2020  2021 and 2022 incentive programs  these programs correspond  together with the Program proposed for the Annual General Meeting 2023  to a total of 1.6 per cent of the total number of shares and votes in the Company.The costs of the Program consist of the subsidy that during June 2026 may be paid as per the above  the social security charges payable on this subsidy and the financing costs for repurchased shares. The total cost has been estimated to approximately MSEK 12 after corporation tax over the duration of the Program. To be compared with the subsidy  the option premium which the Company will receive on transfer of the call options corresponds to a total of approximately MSEK 11.During its duration  the Program will impact the key ratio earnings per share positively through the Company’s repurchase of shares and negatively because of the Company’s transfer of the repurchased shares to the participants in the Program. The net effect on the key ratio earnings per share will be maximum 0.6% during the duration of the Program. The cost for the Company’s repurchase of own shares is estimated to amount to approximately MSEK 60 and will affect the cash flow  liquidity and equity in connection with the repurchase during the duration of the Program. After the duration of the Program  the above effects are expected to be neutralised. The Program is considered to only result in immaterial impact on other important key ratios.Reason for the Program and its preparationSince 2017  the Company has  after a resolution by the Annual General Meeting each year  implemented a yearly recurring long-term incentive program comprising call options  on terms and conditions in all material aspects corresponding to the proposed Program. In the Board of Directors’ assessment  the previously resolved incentive programs have so far fulfilled their purposes. Therefore  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting 2023 resolves on a corresponding incentive program. The reason for implementing the Program is that key employees within the Bufab group should be able to benefit from and strive for  through their own investment  an increase in the price of the Company’s shares  thus more closely aligning the interests of key employees and the Company’s shareholders. The purposes of the Program is also to contribute towards key employees increasing their long-term shareholding in Bufab. The Program is also expected to create conditions for retaining and recruiting competent personnel for the Bufab group  to provide competitive remuneration and to align the interest of the executive management and shareholders. The Board of Directors considers that the Program is reasonable in scope and cost effective. The key employees included in the Program is the group of persons that  in an otherwise heavily decentralised organisation  can create positive effects for the Bufab group. On the basis of this  the Board of Directors believes that the Program has a positive effect on the continued development of the Bufab-group  and that the Program benefits both the shareholders and the Company.The proposal for the Program has been prepared by the Company’s Remuneration Committee in consultation with the Board of Directors of the Company. The Company’s management has not been involved in the preparation. The resolution to propose the Program to the Annual General Meeting has been taken by the Board of Directors. Members of the Board of the Company are not included in the Program.Majority requirementThe Board of Directors’ proposal pursuant to items 19 (A) – (C) above shall be resolved on as one resolution with application of the majority rules in Chapter 16 of the Swedish Companies Act  meaning that shareholders representing at least nine-tenths of both the votes cast and shares represented at the meeting must support the resolution.Resolution on authorization to transfer shares in the Company (item 20)The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorizes the Board of Directors to  on one or more occasions during the period up until the next Annual General Meeting  resolve upon transfer of the Company’s own shares according to the following terms.The maximum number of shares to be transferred may not exceed the number of own shares held by the Company at the time of the Board of Directors’ resolution  provided that the Company always holds such a number of shares that the Company needs to ensure delivery of shares under the Company's ongoing call option-based incentive programs (including any recalculation).Transfer of the Company’s own shares may only take place on Nasdaq Stockholm at a price within the share price interval registered at each point in time  meaning the interval between the highest purchase price and the lowest selling price.The purpose of the authorization is to enable the Company to transfer such shares that the Company has repurchased in order to ensure delivery of shares within the framework of one of the Company’s call option-based incentive programs  but which  partly as a result of the structure of the incentive programs  have not been used for delivery of shares to participants in such incentive programs.The resolution by the meeting requires the support of shareholders representing at least two thirds of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the meeting.E. NUMBER OF SHARES AND VOTES IN THE COMPANYAt the time of the issue of this convening notice  the total number of shares in the Company amounts to 38 110 533 shares corresponding to 38 110 533 votes in total. Of these shares  381 363 are held in treasury and may not be represented at the Annual General Meeting.F. RIGHT TO REQUEST INFORMATIONThe Board of Directors and the CEO shall  upon request of a shareholder  and if the Board of Directors deems this can be done without causing material harm to the Company  inform about matters which might affect the assessment of an item on the agenda or about Bufab´s or its subsidiaries´ financial situation or about Bufab´s relation to another group entity in relation to the consolidated financial statements.G.

If  during the term of office of the Nomination Committee  a shareholder who have appointed a member of the Nomination Committee is no longer among the four largest shareholders with regard to the number of votes held (who upon inquiry has expressed a wish to participate in the nomination committee work)  the member appointed by such shareholder shall resign and the shareholder who have become one of the four largest shareholders with regard to the number of votes held shall be offered to appoint a member of the Nomination Committee. If there are only marginal changes in the number of votes held or if the change occurs later than three months before the Annual General Meeting  no changes shall be made in the composition of the Nomination Committee unless there are special circumstances. A shareholder who has appointed a member of the Nomination Committee has the right to dismiss such member and appoint a new person as member of the Committee.

THE BOARD OF DIRECTOR´S PROPOSED RESOLUTIONS WITH RESPECT TO ITEMS 3  9 b AND 19-20 Preparation and approval of the voting list (item 3)The voting list proposed for approval is the voting list drawn up by Euroclear Sweden AB on behalf of the Company  based on the Annual General Meeting’s register of shareholders  shareholders having given notice of participation and being present in the meeting room  and postal votes received. Appropriation of the Company’s profit pursuant to the adopted balance sheet (item 9 b)The Board of Directors proposes a dividend for the financial year 2022 of SEK 4.75 per share. The Board of Director proposes that the dividend should be disbursed in two instalments  with 24 April 2023 as record date for the first instalment of SEK 2.50 and 24 October 2023 as record date for the second instalment of SEK 2.25. If the Annual General Meeting resolves in accordance with the Board of Directors’ proposal  the estimated date for payment of the dividend from Euroclear Sweden AB to those who are recorded in the share register on the respective record date  is 27 April 2023 for the first instalment and 27 October 2023 for the second instalment. Resolution on the Board of Directors’ proposal to implement a long-term share based incentive program by (A) issuing call options for shares in Bufab  (B) authorising of the Board of Directors to resolve on acquisition of own shares and (C) transferring repurchased shares to participants of the Company’s incentive programs (item 19)Like previous years  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting 2023 resolves to adopt a long-term share based incentive program (the “Program”)  on terms and conditions in line with the 2022 incentive program. The Program  which is proposed to comprise approximately 30 key employees within the Bufab group  essentially involves that the participants are given the opportunity to acquire  at market price  call options relating to shares in Bufab AB (publ) (“Bufab” or the “Company”) repurchased by the Company and that participants who remain as employees within the group after three years and still hold call options may receive a subsidy in the form of gross salary additions corresponding to the premium paid for the call options held at the time of payment. Formally  the Program consists of (A) the issuing of call options for shares in Bufab  (B) an authorisation of the Board of Directors to resolve on acquisition of own shares and (C) transfer of repurchased shares to participants of the Company’s incentive programs in accordance with the following. (A) Resolution on issuing call options for shares in Bufab a) The number of call options to be issued shall not exceed 210 000  corresponding to approximately 0.6 per cent of the total number of shares and votes in the Company. Each call option entitles the holder to acquire one (1) repurchased share in the Company during the period from and including 15 May 2026 up to and including 15 November 2026. However  shares may not be purchased during any such period when trading in the Company’s shares is prohibited in accordance with regulation (EU) no 596/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014 on market abuse (the “market abuse regulation”) or any other equivalent legislation which applies at any given time. b) The purchase price for shares upon exercise of the call option shall correspond to 115 per cent of the volume-weighted average closing prices for the Company’s share on Nasdaq Stockholm during the five trading days before the Board of Directors’ resolution on allotment of call options. c) The right to acquire the call options shall be granted to the CEO of Bufab group  to senior executives and to other key employees within the group who are directly able to influence the group’s profit. The CEO shall be offered a maximum of 30 000 call options. Other participants are divided into two categories depending on seniority  each comprising approximately 15 persons  who shall be offered a maximum of 10 000 and 5 000 call options  respectively  per person. d) If a participant refrains in full or in part from acquiring offered call options  such un-acquired call options shall be allocated on a pro rata basis between those participants who have  in writing  expressed their interest in acquiring additional call options. Participants are not entitled in this manner to acquire more than an additional 30 per cent of the original number of call options offered.e) The call options shall be allotted against payment in accordance with the Board of Directors’ resolution to the CEO  senior executives and other key employees within the Bufab group  in accordance with the guidelines stated in items c) and d) above. Allotment is expected to take place during the second or third quarter 2023.f) Allotment of call options according to item e) shall be made at market value calculated by Ernst & Young AB as an independent valuation institute  applying the Black & Scholes valuation method. The calculation is based on the variables risk-free interest rate  volatility  the term of the call options  expected dividends during the term of the call options  current share price and the acquisition price for shares when exercising the call options (strike price). Since the call options are acquired at market price  no criteria for allocation in the Program are established.g) The issuance of call options to employees outside of Sweden is dependent on tax effects  that there is no legal impediment  and that the Board of Directors determines that such allocation can be carried out with reasonable administrative and financial resources. The Board of Directors shall be entitled to make such minor amendments to the Program as required by applicable foreign legislation and regulations.h) The call options are freely transferable.i) The number of shares which the call options bring entitlement to acquire  as well as the exercise price  may be recalculated as a result of e.g. bonus issues  revers splits or splits of shares  new share issues  a reduction of the share capital  or similar actions. The time of transfer of shares may be brought forward as a result of any merger or similar actions.j) In order to encourage participation in the Program  the Board of Directors is authorised to resolve on a subsidy in the form of gross salary additions  maximum corresponding to the premium paid for each call option. In such cases  the subsidy will be paid in June 2026  subject to the participant at such point in time is remaining in his/her employment or another corresponding employment within the Bufab group and still holding call options. If a participant has disposed a part of its call options  the participant should receive a subsidy maximum corresponding to the premium paid for the call options held by the participant at the time of payment. k) The Company has the right but not any obligation to  on its own or through a third party  repurchase call options at a price corresponding to no more than the market value  with the purpose of facilitating the participant's exercise of the remaining call options acquired under the Program. However  call options may not be repurchased during any such period when trading in the Company’s shares is prohibited in accordance with Article 19 of the market abuse regulation or any other equivalent legislation which applies at any given time.l) The Board of Directors shall  within the framework of the above terms and conditions  be responsible for the preparation and management of the Program. (B) Resolution on authorisation of the Board of Directors to resolve on repurchase of own sharesIn order to hedge Bufab’s delivery of shares to the participants of the Program  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to authorise the Board of Directors to acquire  during the period until the next Annual General Meeting  a maximum of 210 000 shares in the Company. Acquisition shall be made on Nasdaq Stockholm in accordance with stock exchange regulations at a price within the registered price interval from time to time  which is the interval between the highest purchase price and the lowest sale price. Acquired shares shall be paid in cash and acquisitions may be made on one or several occasions. (C) Resolution on transfer of repurchased shares to participants of the Company’s incentive programsThe Board of Directors’ proposal also implies that the Annual General Meeting approves that the Company  with deviation from the shareholders’ preferential right  transfer a maximum of 210 000 of the Company’s repurchased shares to the participants of the Program at the fixed exercise price (subject to any recalculation). Transfer shall take place during the time the participants have the right to exercise call options to acquire shares in accordance with the terms and conditions for the Program. The reason for deviation from the shareholders’ preferential right at transfer of own shares is to enable Bufab to deliver shares in the Company to the participants of the Program. Shares that have been acquired by the Company  and which are not transferred to participants in the Program may be transferred to participants in previous incentive programs or future incentive programs decided on by the General Meeting of the Company. Also such shares acquired by the Company within previous years' incentive programs may be transferred to participants in the Program  previous incentive programs or future incentive programs decided on by the General Meeting. Transfer shall take place in accordance with applicable rules for the current incentive program. Dilution  costs and impact on important key ratiosThe Program does not cause any dilution of the existing shareholders’ share of the votes and capital in the Company since it is based on call options for shares already issued by the Company. The Program corresponds to approximately 0.6 per cent of the total number of shares and votes in the Company. Based on actual participation in the 2020  2021 and 2022 incentive programs  these programs correspond  together with the Program proposed for the Annual General Meeting 2023  to a total of 1.6 per cent of the total number of shares and votes in the Company. The costs of the Program consist of the subsidy that during June 2026 may be paid as per the above  the social security charges payable on this subsidy and the financing costs for repurchased shares. The total cost has been estimated to approximately MSEK 12 after corporation tax over the duration of the Program. To be compared with the subsidy  the option premium which the Company will receive on transfer of the call options corresponds to a total of approximately MSEK 11.During its duration  the Program will impact the key ratio earnings per share positively through the Company’s repurchase of shares and negatively because of the Company’s transfer of the repurchased shares to the participants in the Program. The net effect on the key ratio earnings per share will be maximum 0.6% during the duration of the Program. The cost for the Company’s repurchase of own shares is estimated to amount to approximately MSEK 60 and will affect the cash flow  liquidity and equity in connection with the repurchase during the duration of the Program. After the duration of the Program  the above effects are expected to be neutralised. The Program is considered to only result in immaterial impact on other important key ratios. Reason for the Program and its preparationSince 2017  the Company has  after a resolution by the Annual General Meeting each year  implemented a yearly recurring long-term incentive program comprising call options  on terms and conditions in all material aspects corresponding to the proposed Program. In the Board of Directors’ assessment  the previously resolved incentive programs have so far fulfilled their purposes. Therefore  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting 2023 resolves on a corresponding incentive program. The reason for implementing the Program is that key employees within the Bufab group should be able to benefit from and strive for  through their own investment  an increase in the price of the Company’s shares  thus more closely aligning the interests of key employees and the Company’s shareholders. The purposes of the Program is also to contribute towards key employees increasing their long-term shareholding in Bufab. The Program is also expected to create conditions for retaining and recruiting competent personnel for the Bufab group  to provide competitive remuneration and to align the interest of the executive management and shareholders. The Board of Directors considers that the Program is reasonable in scope and cost effective. The key employees included in the Program is the group of persons that  in an otherwise heavily decentralised organisation  can create positive effects for the Bufab group. On the basis of this  the Board of Directors believes that the Program has a positive effect on the continued development of the Bufab-group  and that the Program benefits both the shareholders and the Company. The proposal for the Program has been prepared by the Company’s Remuneration Committee in consultation with the Board of Directors of the Company. The Company’s management has not been involved in the preparation. The resolution to propose the Program to the Annual General Meeting has been taken by the Board of Directors. Members of the Board of the Company are not included in the Program. Majority requirementThe Board of Directors’ proposal pursuant to items 19 (A) – (C) above shall be resolved on as one resolution with application of the majority rules in Chapter 16 of the Swedish Companies Act  meaning that shareholders representing at least nine-tenths of both the votes cast and shares represented at the meeting must support the resolution. Resolution on authorization to transfer shares in the Company (item 20)The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorizes the Board of Directors to  on one or more occasions during the period up until the next Annual General Meeting  resolve upon transfer of the Company’s own shares according to the following terms. The maximum number of shares to be transferred may not exceed the number of own shares held by the Company at the time of the Board of Directors’ resolution  provided that the Company always holds such a number of shares that the Company needs to ensure delivery of shares under the Company's ongoing call option-based incentive programs (including any recalculation).Transfer of the Company’s own shares may only take place on Nasdaq Stockholm at a price within the share price interval registered at each point in time  meaning the interval between the highest purchase price and the lowest selling price.The purpose of the authorization is to enable the Company to transfer such shares that the Company has repurchased in order to ensure delivery of shares within the framework of one of the Company’s call option-based incentive programs  but which  partly as a result of the structure of the incentive programs  have not been used for delivery of shares to participants in such incentive programs. The resolution by the meeting requires the support of shareholders representing at least two thirds of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the meeting. E. NUMBER OF SHARES AND VOTES IN THE COMPANYAt the time of the issue of this convening notice  the total number of shares in the Company amounts to 38 110 533 shares corresponding to 38 110 533 votes in total. Of these shares  381 363 are held in treasury and may not be represented at the Annual General Meeting. F. RIGHT TO REQUEST INFORMATIONThe Board of Directors and the CEO shall  upon request of a shareholder  and if the Board of Directors deems this can be done without causing material harm to the Company  inform about matters which might affect the assessment of an item on the agenda or about Bufab´s or its subsidiaries´ financial situation or about Bufab´s relation to another group entity in relation to the consolidated financial statements.

THE BOARD OF DIRECTOR´S PROPOSED RESOLUTIONS WITH RESPECT TO ITEMS 3  9 b AND 19-20 Preparation and approval of the voting list (item 3)The voting list proposed for approval is the voting list drawn up by Euroclear Sweden AB on behalf of the Company  based on the Annual General Meeting’s register of shareholders  shareholders having given notice of participation and being present in the meeting room  and postal votes received. Appropriation of the Company’s profit pursuant to the adopted balance sheet (item 9 b)The Board of Directors proposes a dividend for the financial year 2022 of SEK 4.75 per share. The Board of Director proposes that the dividend should be disbursed in two instalments  with 24 April 2023 as record date for the first instalment of SEK 2.50 and 24 October 2023 as record date for the second instalment of SEK 2.25. If the Annual General Meeting resolves in accordance with the Board of Directors’ proposal  the estimated date for payment of the dividend from Euroclear Sweden AB to those who are recorded in the share register on the respective record date  is 27 April 2023 for the first instalment and 27 October 2023 for the second instalment. Resolution on the Board of Directors’ proposal to implement a long-term share based incentive program by (A) issuing call options for shares in Bufab  (B) authorising of the Board of Directors to resolve on acquisition of own shares and (C) transferring repurchased shares to participants of the Company’s incentive programs (item 19)Like previous years  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting 2023 resolves to adopt a long-term share based incentive program (the “Program”)  on terms and conditions in line with the 2022 incentive program. The Program  which is proposed to comprise approximately 30 key employees within the Bufab group  essentially involves that the participants are given the opportunity to acquire  at market price  call options relating to shares in Bufab AB (publ) (“Bufab” or the “Company”) repurchased by the Company and that participants who remain as employees within the group after three years and still hold call options may receive a subsidy in the form of gross salary additions corresponding to the premium paid for the call options held at the time of payment. Formally  the Program consists of (A) the issuing of call options for shares in Bufab  (B) an authorisation of the Board of Directors to resolve on acquisition of own shares and (C) transfer of repurchased shares to participants of the Company’s incentive programs in accordance with the following. (A) Resolution on issuing call options for shares in Bufab a) The number of call options to be issued shall not exceed 210 000  corresponding to approximately 0.6 per cent of the total number of shares and votes in the Company. Each call option entitles the holder to acquire one (1) repurchased share in the Company during the period from and including 15 May 2026 up to and including 15 November 2026. However  shares may not be purchased during any such period when trading in the Company’s shares is prohibited in accordance with regulation (EU) no 596/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014 on market abuse (the “market abuse regulation”) or any other equivalent legislation which applies at any given time. b) The purchase price for shares upon exercise of the call option shall correspond to 115 per cent of the volume-weighted average closing prices for the Company’s share on Nasdaq Stockholm during the five trading days before the Board of Directors’ resolution on allotment of call options. c) The right to acquire the call options shall be granted to the CEO of Bufab group  to senior executives and to other key employees within the group who are directly able to influence the group’s profit. The CEO shall be offered a maximum of 30 000 call options. Other participants are divided into two categories depending on seniority  each comprising approximately 15 persons  who shall be offered a maximum of 10 000 and 5 000 call options  respectively  per person. d) If a participant refrains in full or in part from acquiring offered call options  such un-acquired call options shall be allocated on a pro rata basis between those participants who have  in writing  expressed their interest in acquiring additional call options. Participants are not entitled in this manner to acquire more than an additional 30 per cent of the original number of call options offered.e) The call options shall be allotted against payment in accordance with the Board of Directors’ resolution to the CEO  senior executives and other key employees within the Bufab group  in accordance with the guidelines stated in items c) and d) above. Allotment is expected to take place during the second or third quarter 2023.f) Allotment of call options according to item e) shall be made at market value calculated by Ernst & Young AB as an independent valuation institute  applying the Black & Scholes valuation method. The calculation is based on the variables risk-free interest rate  volatility  the term of the call options  expected dividends during the term of the call options  current share price and the acquisition price for shares when exercising the call options (strike price). Since the call options are acquired at market price  no criteria for allocation in the Program are established.g) The issuance of call options to employees outside of Sweden is dependent on tax effects  that there is no legal impediment  and that the Board of Directors determines that such allocation can be carried out with reasonable administrative and financial resources. The Board of Directors shall be entitled to make such minor amendments to the Program as required by applicable foreign legislation and regulations.h) The call options are freely transferable.i) The number of shares which the call options bring entitlement to acquire  as well as the exercise price  may be recalculated as a result of e.g. bonus issues  revers splits or splits of shares  new share issues  a reduction of the share capital  or similar actions. The time of transfer of shares may be brought forward as a result of any merger or similar actions.j) In order to encourage participation in the Program  the Board of Directors is authorised to resolve on a subsidy in the form of gross salary additions  maximum corresponding to the premium paid for each call option. In such cases  the subsidy will be paid in June 2026  subject to the participant at such point in time is remaining in his/her employment or another corresponding employment within the Bufab group and still holding call options. If a participant has disposed a part of its call options  the participant should receive a subsidy maximum corresponding to the premium paid for the call options held by the participant at the time of payment. k) The Company has the right but not any obligation to  on its own or through a third party  repurchase call options at a price corresponding to no more than the market value  with the purpose of facilitating the participant's exercise of the remaining call options acquired under the Program. However  call options may not be repurchased during any such period when trading in the Company’s shares is prohibited in accordance with Article 19 of the market abuse regulation or any other equivalent legislation which applies at any given time.l) The Board of Directors shall  within the framework of the above terms and conditions  be responsible for the preparation and management of the Program. (B) Resolution on authorisation of the Board of Directors to resolve on repurchase of own sharesIn order to hedge Bufab’s delivery of shares to the participants of the Program  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to authorise the Board of Directors to acquire  during the period until the next Annual General Meeting  a maximum of 210 000 shares in the Company. Acquisition shall be made on Nasdaq Stockholm in accordance with stock exchange regulations at a price within the registered price interval from time to time  which is the interval between the highest purchase price and the lowest sale price. Acquired shares shall be paid in cash and acquisitions may be made on one or several occasions. (C) Resolution on transfer of repurchased shares to participants of the Company’s incentive programsThe Board of Directors’ proposal also implies that the Annual General Meeting approves that the Company  with deviation from the shareholders’ preferential right  transfer a maximum of 210 000 of the Company’s repurchased shares to the participants of the Program at the fixed exercise price (subject to any recalculation). Transfer shall take place during the time the participants have the right to exercise call options to acquire shares in accordance with the terms and conditions for the Program. The reason for deviation from the shareholders’ preferential right at transfer of own shares is to enable Bufab to deliver shares in the Company to the participants of the Program. Shares that have been acquired by the Company  and which are not transferred to participants in the Program may be transferred to participants in previous incentive programs or future incentive programs decided on by the General Meeting of the Company. Also such shares acquired by the Company within previous years' incentive programs may be transferred to participants in the Program  previous incentive programs or future incentive programs decided on by the General Meeting. Transfer shall take place in accordance with applicable rules for the current incentive program. Dilution  costs and impact on important key ratiosThe Program does not cause any dilution of the existing shareholders’ share of the votes and capital in the Company since it is based on call options for shares already issued by the Company. The Program corresponds to approximately 0.6 per cent of the total number of shares and votes in the Company. Based on actual participation in the 2020  2021 and 2022 incentive programs  these programs correspond  together with the Program proposed for the Annual General Meeting 2023  to a total of 1.6 per cent of the total number of shares and votes in the Company. The costs of the Program consist of the subsidy that during June 2026 may be paid as per the above  the social security charges payable on this subsidy and the financing costs for repurchased shares. The total cost has been estimated to approximately MSEK 12 after corporation tax over the duration of the Program. To be compared with the subsidy  the option premium which the Company will receive on transfer of the call options corresponds to a total of approximately MSEK 11.During its duration  the Program will impact the key ratio earnings per share positively through the Company’s repurchase of shares and negatively because of the Company’s transfer of the repurchased shares to the participants in the Program. The net effect on the key ratio earnings per share will be maximum 0.6% during the duration of the Program. The cost for the Company’s repurchase of own shares is estimated to amount to approximately MSEK 60 and will affect the cash flow  liquidity and equity in connection with the repurchase during the duration of the Program. After the duration of the Program  the above effects are expected to be neutralised. The Program is considered to only result in immaterial impact on other important key ratios. Reason for the Program and its preparationSince 2017  the Company has  after a resolution by the Annual General Meeting each year  implemented a yearly recurring long-term incentive program comprising call options  on terms and conditions in all material aspects corresponding to the proposed Program. In the Board of Directors’ assessment  the previously resolved incentive programs have so far fulfilled their purposes. Therefore  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting 2023 resolves on a corresponding incentive program. The reason for implementing the Program is that key employees within the Bufab group should be able to benefit from and strive for  through their own investment  an increase in the price of the Company’s shares  thus more closely aligning the interests of key employees and the Company’s shareholders. The purposes of the Program is also to contribute towards key employees increasing their long-term shareholding in Bufab. The Program is also expected to create conditions for retaining and recruiting competent personnel for the Bufab group  to provide competitive remuneration and to align the interest of the executive management and shareholders. The Board of Directors considers that the Program is reasonable in scope and cost effective. The key employees included in the Program is the group of persons that  in an otherwise heavily decentralised organisation  can create positive effects for the Bufab group. On the basis of this  the Board of Directors believes that the Program has a positive effect on the continued development of the Bufab-group  and that the Program benefits both the shareholders and the Company. The proposal for the Program has been prepared by the Company’s Remuneration Committee in consultation with the Board of Directors of the Company. The Company’s management has not been involved in the preparation. The resolution to propose the Program to the Annual General Meeting has been taken by the Board of Directors. Members of the Board of the Company are not included in the Program. Majority requirementThe Board of Directors’ proposal pursuant to items 19 (A) – (C) above shall be resolved on as one resolution with application of the majority rules in Chapter 16 of the Swedish Companies Act  meaning that shareholders representing at least nine-tenths of both the votes cast and shares represented at the meeting must support the resolution. Resolution on authorization to transfer shares in the Company (item 20)The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorizes the Board of Directors to  on one or more occasions during the period up until the next Annual General Meeting  resolve upon transfer of the Company’s own shares according to the following terms. The maximum number of shares to be transferred may not exceed the number of own shares held by the Company at the time of the Board of Directors’ resolution  provided that the Company always holds such a number of shares that the Company needs to ensure delivery of shares under the Company's ongoing call option-based incentive programs (including any recalculation).Transfer of the Company’s own shares may only take place on Nasdaq Stockholm at a price within the share price interval registered at each point in time  meaning the interval between the highest purchase price and the lowest selling price.The purpose of the authorization is to enable the Company to transfer such shares that the Company has repurchased in order to ensure delivery of shares within the framework of one of the Company’s call option-based incentive programs  but which  partly as a result of the structure of the incentive programs  have not been used for delivery of shares to participants in such incentive programs. The resolution by the meeting requires the support of shareholders representing at least two thirds of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the meeting. E. NUMBER OF SHARES AND VOTES IN THE COMPANYAt the time of the issue of this convening notice  the total number of shares in the Company amounts to 38 110 533 shares corresponding to 38 110 533 votes in total. Of these shares  381 363 are held in treasury and may not be represented at the Annual General Meeting. F. RIGHT TO REQUEST INFORMATIONThe Board of Directors and the CEO shall  upon request of a shareholder  and if the Board of Directors deems this can be done without causing material harm to the Company  inform about matters which might affect the assessment of an item on the agenda or about Bufab´s or its subsidiaries´ financial situation or about Bufab´s relation to another group entity in relation to the consolidated financial statements.

This resolution is being taken in terms and for the purposes of the approvals necessary in terms of the Companies Act and the Articles of Association of the Company.27. Resolution (t)Performance share plan for the senior managementThe Board of Directors has reviewed remuneration for the senior management and concluded that the Company would benefit from a continuation of a performance share plan that complements the stock option plan to further increase the senior management's alignment with long-term shareholder value creation. The Board proposes that the 2023 Annual General Meeting resolves to approve the Board of Directors' proposal regarding a performance share plan to the senior management in Kindred Group which will be used in conjunction with the existing stock option plan (SOP).In the proposed plan  the performance measure is a non-market based condition that provides participants (approximately 109) with a high degree of alignment to Company performance. PSP awards will depend on Kindred achieving financial performance target (i.e. EBITDA) over three financial years establishing a clearer link between how Kindred performs and the value that the PSP can deliver.The suggested performance share plan may in total comprise no more than 0 3% of all issued shares in Kindred annually  and on an accumulated basis the five plans of 2023-2027 will amount to around 1 1% of dilution.Closing of the meetingInformation about proposals related to Agenda itemsAgenda item 2The Nomination Committee will publish the information of its proposal for a Chairman of the AGM 2023 on a later date.Agenda item 8The Board of Directors proposes a dividend of GBP 0.345  which is approximately SEK 4.35 at the exchange rate 12.63 GBP/SEK at 28 February 2023 per SDR/share  to be paid to holders of ordinary shares/ SDRs. In order to facilitate a more efficient cash management  the dividend is proposed to be paid in two equal instalments.

Should any of these shareholders appoint the Chairman of the Board of Directors to the Nomination Committee  the Nomination Committee shall consist of five members. Otherwise  the Chairman of the Board shall be adjunct to the Nomination Committee. The other members shall be appointed by each of the subsequent largest shareholders expressing their willingness to participate in the Nomination Committee  within one week after they have been so asked. At the appointment of a member to the Nomination Committee  it shall be stated which shareholder that has appointed the member in question. Should a shareholder waive its right to appoint a member to the Nomination Committee  the opportunity to appoint a member shall be passed to the following largest shareholder which has already not appointed a member to the Nomination Committee.The members of the Nomination Committee shall appoint the committee chair among themselves. The Chairman of the Board shall not chair the Nomination Committee. The names of the members of the Nomination Committee shall be announced no later than the date of the publication of the Company's interim report for the third quarter of 2023.Should the ownership in the Company change  after the announcement of the Nomination Committee but before the end of the fourth quarter of 2023  to such an extent that the members of the Nomination Committee no longer reflect the shareholding structure as stipulated above  and the Nomination Committee so considers appropriate  the member of the Nomination Committee representing the shareholder with the lesser number of shares in the Company shall resign from the committee and the shareholder who has become the larger shareholder in the Company shall  in the order corresponding to its shareholding in the Company  be offered to appoint a new member to the Nomination Commit-tee.

Should a member of the Nomination Committee leave his/her assignment prematurely and if the Nomination Committee deems appropriate  a new member shall be appointed by the shareholder who appointed the resigning member or  if the company shareholding structure has changed in the relevant make  by the shareholder who at that point of time has the larger shareholding in the Company.No remuneration shall be paid to the members of the Nomination Committee. However  the Nomination Committee shall have the right to engage outside expertise and consultancy services related to its assignments and to ensure their reimbursement by the Company.Agenda item 24Acquisition of Own SharesThe Board of Directors proposes that the acquisition of shares/SDRs shall take place on Nasdaq Stockholm or via an offer to acquire the shares/SDRs to all shareholders. The purchases may take place on multiple occasions and will be based on actual market price and terms  prevailing regulations and the capital situation at any given time. Notification of any purchase will be made to Nasdaq Stockholm and details will appear in the Company's annual report and accounts.The objective of the purchase is to achieve added value for the Company's shareholders (including through the implementation of the share buy-back program previously announced)1 and to give the Board increased flexibility with the Company's capital structure.Following the purchase  the intention of the Board would be to either cancel  use as consideration for an acquisition or issue to employees under a Share Option programme or Share Performance Scheme.Once purchased under the Maltese Companies Act further shareholder approval will be required before those shares could be cancelled only. Shares/SDRs bought back pursuant to the Company's share buy-back program will be cancelled (refer to Agenda item 26). A separate authorisation for such cancellation is being recommended pursuant to Resolution (s).If used as consideration for an acquisition  the intention would be that the actual shares/SDRs would be offered to any potential transferor.Agenda item 25Share cancellationThe directors may decide to cancel all or some of shares/SDRs acquired pursuant to the buy-back program.The Companies Act (Cap. 386 of the laws of Malta) stipulates that an extraordinary resolution of the shareholders of the Company is required in order to approve the reduction in the issued share capital of the Company.Such resolution needs to be filed with the Registrar of Companies in Malta  who will publish details of such reduction. Creditors of the Company will then have a period of three months during which they can contest the reduction in capital. Upon the lapse of the three-month period  assuming that no contestations are received  the reduction in share capital can become effective.In order to reflect the changes in the issued share capital  a revised memorandum of association of the Company indicating the reduced number of shares then in issue in the capital of the Company will need to be submitted to the Registrar of Companies.The reduction in issued share capital will take place at such intervals and in such amounts (subject to the maximum amount of GBP 14 375) as the directors shall determine from time to time.Agenda item 26Share issueThe objectives of the authorisation to be granted in terms of this resolution are to increase the financial flexibility of the Company and to enable the Company to use its own financial instruments for payment in kind or through a set-off to a selling partner in connection with any business acquisitions the Company may undertake or to settle any deferred payments in connection with business acquisitions. The market value of the shares/SDRs on each issue date that will be used in determining the price at which shares/SDRs will be issued  should be the same as the market value of the shares/SDRs listed on Nasdaq Stockholm. A cap of 23 million ordinary shares/SDRs in the Company is being requested in connection with this authorisation. The cap will be reduced by the amount of any shares/SDRs bought back and held by the Company excluding however any shares/SDRs held by the Company from the said calculation.Agenda item 27Performance share plan for the senior managementThe Board of Directors has reviewed remuneration for the senior management and concluded that the Company would benefit from a continuation of a performance share plan that complements the stock option plan to further increase the senior management's alignment with long-term shareholder value creation. The Board proposes that the 2023 Annual General Meeting resolves to approve the Board of Directors' proposal regarding a performance share plan to the senior management in Kindred Group which will be used in conjunction with the existing stock option plan (SOP).In the proposed plan  the performance measure is a non-market based condition that provides participants (approximately 109) with a high degree of alignment to Company performance. PSP awards will depend on Kindred achieving financial performance target (i.e. EBITDA) over three financial years establishing a clearer link between how Kindred performs and the value that the PSP can deliver.The suggested performance share plan may in total comprise no more than 0 3% of all issued shares in Kindred annually  and on an accumulated basis the five plans of 2023-2027 will amount to around 1 1% of dilution.The Annual Report in English together with other documents regarding the AGM are available on the Company's website www.kindredgroup.com /AGM .For information on how personal data are processed please seehttps://www.euroclear.com/dam/ESwithLegal/Privacy-notice-bolagsstammor-engelska.pdfBy order of the BoardKindred Group plcMalta  March 17 2023Contact:Johan WilsbyJohan.Wilsby@kindredgroup.comNOTE1.

The Share Issue Limit shall be reduced by the amount of any shares/SDRs which are bought back and held by the Company). This resolution is being taken in terms and for the purposes of the approvals necessary in terms of the Companies Act and the Articles of Association of the Company.27. Resolution (t)Performance share plan for the senior managementThe Board of Directors has reviewed remuneration for the senior management and concluded that the Company would benefit from a continuation of a performance share plan that complements the stock option plan to further increase the senior management's alignment with long-term shareholder value creation. The Board proposes that the 2023 Annual General Meeting resolves to approve the Board of Directors' proposal regarding a performance share plan to the senior management in Kindred Group which will be used in conjunction with the existing stock option plan (SOP).In the proposed plan  the performance measure is a non-market based condition that provides participants (approximately 109) with a high degree of alignment to Company performance. PSP awards will depend on Kindred achieving financial performance target (i.e. EBITDA) over three financial years establishing a clearer link between how Kindred performs and the value that the PSP can deliver.The suggested performance share plan may in total comprise no more than 0 3% of all issued shares in Kindred annually  and on an accumulated basis the five plans of 2023-2027 will amount to around 1 1% of dilution.Closing of the meetingInformation about proposals related to Agenda itemsAgenda item 2The Nomination Committee will publish the information of its proposal for a Chairman of the AGM 2023 on a later date.Agenda item 8The Board of Directors proposes a dividend of GBP 0.345  which is approximately SEK 4.35 at the exchange rate 12.63 GBP/SEK at 28 February 2023 per SDR/share  to be paid to holders of ordinary shares/ SDRs. In order to facilitate a more efficient cash management  the dividend is proposed to be paid in two equal instalments. If approved at the AGM  the record date for the first instalment will be 24 April 2023 and distributed by Euroclear Sweden AB on 27 April 2023 with an ex-dividend date of 21 April 2023  and for the second instalment the record date will be 24 October 2023 and distributed by Euroclear Sweden AB on 27 October 2023 with an ex-dividend date of 23 October 2023. For accounting purposes  the rates of exchange to be used shall be the SEK-GBP rate prevalent on 21 April 2023 and 23 October 2023 respectively.Agenda item 9The 2022 Annual Report was finalised and signed on 15 March 2023 and reflects events up to that date.Agenda item 10The Board of Directors proposes that the AGM approves the remuneration report on pages 103-109 of the Company's Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2022.Agenda item 11The Nomination Committee proposes that the Board of Directors should consist of eight Directors.The following members of the current Board of Directors of the Company  being Peter Boggs  Gunnel Duveblad  Erik Forsberg  Carl-Magnus Månsson and Fredrik Peyron  have declared that they will not stand for re-election at the Company's 2023 AGM.Agenda item 12The Nomination Committee proposes that a total fee of maximum GBP 861 500 (2022: GBP757 000) be paid to Directors elected at the AGM  who are not employees of the Company.

Should any of these shareholders appoint the Chairman of the Board of Directors to the Nomination Committee  the Nomination Committee shall consist of five members. Otherwise  the Chairman of the Board shall be adjunct to the Nomination Committee. The other members shall be appointed by each of the subsequent largest shareholders expressing their willingness to participate in the Nomination Committee  within one week after they have been so asked. At the appointment of a member to the Nomination Committee  it shall be stated which shareholder that has appointed the member in question. Should a shareholder waive its right to appoint a member to the Nomination Committee  the opportunity to appoint a member shall be passed to the following largest shareholder which has already not appointed a member to the Nomination Committee.The members of the Nomination Committee shall appoint the committee chair among themselves. The Chairman of the Board shall not chair the Nomination Committee. The names of the members of the Nomination Committee shall be announced no later than the date of the publication of the Company's interim report for the third quarter of 2023.Should the ownership in the Company change  after the announcement of the Nomination Committee but before the end of the fourth quarter of 2023  to such an extent that the members of the Nomination Committee no longer reflect the shareholding structure as stipulated above  and the Nomination Committee so considers appropriate  the member of the Nomination Committee representing the shareholder with the lesser number of shares in the Company shall resign from the committee and the shareholder who has become the larger shareholder in the Company shall  in the order corresponding to its shareholding in the Company  be offered to appoint a new member to the Nomination Commit-tee.

However  the Nomination Committee shall have the right to engage outside expertise and consultancy services related to its assignments and to ensure their reimbursement by the Company.Agenda item 24Acquisition of Own SharesThe Board of Directors proposes that the acquisition of shares/SDRs shall take place on Nasdaq Stockholm or via an offer to acquire the shares/SDRs to all shareholders. The purchases may take place on multiple occasions and will be based on actual market price and terms  prevailing regulations and the capital situation at any given time. Notification of any purchase will be made to Nasdaq Stockholm and details will appear in the Company's annual report and accounts.The objective of the purchase is to achieve added value for the Company's shareholders (including through the implementation of the share buy-back program previously announced)1 and to give the Board increased flexibility with the Company's capital structure.Following the purchase  the intention of the Board would be to either cancel  use as consideration for an acquisition or issue to employees under a Share Option programme or Share Performance Scheme.Once purchased under the Maltese Companies Act further shareholder approval will be required before those shares could be cancelled only. Shares/SDRs bought back pursuant to the Company's share buy-back program will be cancelled (refer to Agenda item 26). A separate authorisation for such cancellation is being recommended pursuant to Resolution (s).If used as consideration for an acquisition  the intention would be that the actual shares/SDRs would be offered to any potential transferor.Agenda item 25Share cancellationThe directors may decide to cancel all or some of shares/SDRs acquired pursuant to the buy-back program.The Companies Act (Cap. 386 of the laws of Malta) stipulates that an extraordinary resolution of the shareholders of the Company is required in order to approve the reduction in the issued share capital of the Company.Such resolution needs to be filed with the Registrar of Companies in Malta  who will publish details of such reduction. Creditors of the Company will then have a period of three months during which they can contest the reduction in capital. Upon the lapse of the three-month period  assuming that no contestations are received  the reduction in share capital can become effective.In order to reflect the changes in the issued share capital  a revised memorandum of association of the Company indicating the reduced number of shares then in issue in the capital of the Company will need to be submitted to the Registrar of Companies.The reduction in issued share capital will take place at such intervals and in such amounts (subject to the maximum amount of GBP 14 375) as the directors shall determine from time to time.Agenda item 26Share issueThe objectives of the authorisation to be granted in terms of this resolution are to increase the financial flexibility of the Company and to enable the Company to use its own financial instruments for payment in kind or through a set-off to a selling partner in connection with any business acquisitions the Company may undertake or to settle any deferred payments in connection with business acquisitions. The market value of the shares/SDRs on each issue date that will be used in determining the price at which shares/SDRs will be issued  should be the same as the market value of the shares/SDRs listed on Nasdaq Stockholm. A cap of 23 million ordinary shares/SDRs in the Company is being requested in connection with this authorisation. The cap will be reduced by the amount of any shares/SDRs bought back and held by the Company excluding however any shares/SDRs held by the Company from the said calculation.Agenda item 27Performance share plan for the senior managementThe Board of Directors has reviewed remuneration for the senior management and concluded that the Company would benefit from a continuation of a performance share plan that complements the stock option plan to further increase the senior management's alignment with long-term shareholder value creation. The Board proposes that the 2023 Annual General Meeting resolves to approve the Board of Directors' proposal regarding a performance share plan to the senior management in Kindred Group which will be used in conjunction with the existing stock option plan (SOP).In the proposed plan  the performance measure is a non-market based condition that provides participants (approximately 109) with a high degree of alignment to Company performance.

Kaiko feeds data to the likes of Deutsche Boerse and ICE Global Network.“With all of the recent changes and initiatives from the Hong Kong regulatory bodies  we realized that this is clearly where we have to be  where the capital is going to flow in  and where we are seeing a lot of attractiveness when it comes to hedge funds  investors and asset managers ” Soubiran said.Hong Kong is trying to develop crypto rules that will encourage growth and protect investors  seeking to learn lessons from bankruptcies like the FTX exchange while positioning for a rebound from a $2 trillion market rout.The city plans to let retail investors trade larger tokens like Bitcoin and Ether later this year. A mandatory licensing regime for stablecoins — a type of crypto token that’s meant to hold a constant value — is due by 2023-2024.The developments in Hong Kong contrast with a swingeing crackdown on crypto in the US  where digital-asset firms are also increasingly cut off from the traditional banking sector after a trio of lenders collapsed. Singapore  meanwhile  has proposed tighter rules in the wake of the FTX wipeout.Hong Kong’s “regulatory landscape is changing positively ” said Soubiran. She added that she wants to “make sure we can support that institutionalization and that kind of growth and establishment of the asset class in Hong Kong.”Story continuesChallengesA major challenge for Hong Kong is that the virtual-asset industry remains in a deep downturn after a bubble in token prices deflated last year and investors fled. Exchanges Coinbase Global Inc.  Crypto.com and Huobi are among a slew of firms that have slashed thousands of jobs in the past few months.Other companies are in a holding pattern as they await a crypto recovery and the final version of Hong Kong’s revamped digital-asset rules before deciding whether to commit scarce investment funds.Kaiko said Head of Asia-Pacific Sean Lawrence will relocate from Singapore by the end of March. Figuratively “something like nine out of 10 people” in crypto are discussing about returning to Hong Kong in some way  Lawrence said in an interview.A new Hong Kong licensing regime for crypto exchanges is due on June 1. The pivot toward fostering the digital-asset sector is part of a wider effort to restore Hong Kong’s credentials as a cutting-edge financial center after Covid-related curbs and political unrest sparked a brain drain.For crypto market prices: CRYP; for top crypto news: TOP CRYPTO.Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek©2023 Bloomberg L.P.,neutral,0.02,0.98,0.0,mixed,0.36,0.19,0.45,True,English,"['Hong Kong Lures', 'Data Provider Kaiko', 'Crypto Hub', 'Push', 'Chief Executive Officer Ambre Soubiran', 'new Hong Kong licensing regime', 'Exchanges Coinbase Global Inc.', 'Cryptocurrency market data provider', 'Hong Kong regulatory bodies', 'mandatory licensing regime', '$2 trillion market rout', 'ICE Global Network', 'cutting-edge financial center', 'traditional banking sector', 'scarce investment funds', 'Asia-Pacific Sean Lawrence', 'crypto market prices', 'Bloomberg L.P.', 'top crypto news', 'crypto policy pivot', 'crypto exchanges', 'global hub', 'regulatory landscape', 'hedge funds', 'token prices', 'digital-asset sector', 'crypto rules', 'crypto token', 'Crypto.com', 'crypto recovery', 'Asian headquarters', 'digital-asset industry', 'Covid-related curbs', 'Paris-based company', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'recent changes', 'asset managers', 'FTX exchange', 'larger tokens', 'constant value', 'swingeing crackdown', 'tighter rules', 'FTX wipeout', 'asset class', 'major challenge', 'virtual-asset industry', 'deep downturn', 'Other companies', 'holding pattern', 'final version', 'digital-asset rules', 'wider effort', 'political unrest', 'brain drain', 'Bloomberg Businessweek', 'digital-asset firms', 'retail investors', 'Kaiko', 'Singapore', 'city', 'push', 'emergence', 'decision', 'interview', 'Thursday', 'likes', 'initiatives', 'capital', 'lot', 'attractiveness', 'growth', 'lessons', 'bankruptcies', 'rebound', 'Bitcoin', 'Ether', 'stablecoins', 'type', 'developments', 'trio', 'lenders', 'wake', 'institutionalization', 'kind', 'establishment', 'Story', 'Challenges', 'bubble', 'Huobi', 'slew', 'thousands', 'jobs', 'past', 'months', 'March', 'something', 'nine', '10 people', 'way', 'June', 'part', 'credentials']",2023-03-17,2023-03-18,finance.yahoo.com

In Asia  stock benchmarks gained  Treasury yields were mixed; the dollar edged lower; while oil futures and gold advanced.Equities:European stock futures rose early Friday  tracking gains on Wall Street  and as fears of a rolling banking crisis eased after after 11 of the U.S.'s biggest banks on Thursday deposited $30 billion to prop up First Republic Bank.Worries about risk in the banking sector following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and two other U.S. lenders have weighed on markets over the past week.""We certainly are on alert and watching for signals that the stress can permeate across asset classes and industries and leak into the real economy  which it certainly will "" said Adam Abbas  co-head of fixed income at Harris Associates.""There will be knock-on effects.""In light of the market volatility  federal-funds futures point to an 80% chance that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates by a quarter-percentage point next week. A week ago  wagers reflected only a one-third odds of such an increase  suggesting a larger half-percentage point raise was more likely.The ECB's decision to plow through with a half-point hike despite the turmoil in the banking sector is being seen as offering a potential model for the Fed  according to analysts.""Here's the challenge-if they go with 50 basis points  I would say that they are probably not being sensitive enough to some of the stressors that are obviously impacting the banks "" said Gerry Goldberg  chief executive at GYL Financial Synergies.""If they do nothing  while some might be relieved  it may also be interpreted by the broader market as  'Wait a second  if they are pausing  maybe we should have greater concern.'""Mr. Goldberg said he believes that leaves the Fed with the option of raising rates by quarter-percentage point.Forex:The dollar edged lower early Friday amid a mild risk-on mood.A U.S. banking-industry-wide rescue to shore up ailing First Republic Bank has given some much-needed reassurances to market participants  said IG.This news has helped to calm market nerves in an extremely bearish risk environment  it added.""It's pretty fascinating given the chaos we've seen in fixed income and yields "" Oanda said.""We're on standby until we get to the March 22 meeting "" it said.""Haven flows into the yen has been one of the clearer trades over this period. Now we're going to see if risk appetite comes back even more  and that could weigh on the dollar. You may see European currencies get a nice rebound here.""Bonds:Treasury yields were mixed as markets look more convinced that the Fed will raise rates next week instead of taking a pause.""The Fed's goal is getting inflation in check and stabilizing the labor market. Neither of these are directly impacted by the SVB [Silicon Valley Bank] situation. SVB is a result of Fed tightening  however  the direct response is likely contained to a small subset of the market -- primarily VC backed companies. The decline of VC backed companies will likely not have a significant impact on inflation or the labor market in the US economy "" said Austin Graff  co-chief investment officer and portfolio manager of the TrueShares Low Volatility Equity Income ETF.""The Fed wants to avoid a stop/start process to rate hikes so we probably won't see the Fed change their course on rates until there is more clear data that inflation and the labor market are closer to desired levels "" Graff said.""Many strategists are forecasting key interest rate cuts later this year  but that seems very premature to me "" Louis Navellier  from Navellier & Associates said.Energy:Oil futures were higher in Asia  amid positive market sentiment  spurred by news that eleven U.S. banks have deposited $30 billion to support ailing First Republic Bank.However  an increase in U.S. crude-oil inventories adds fuel to recent sell off in oil  said DailyFX.com  noting EIA data showing weekly crude-oil stockpiles rose more than expected.Crude was pressured in recent sessions as banking woes amplified recession worries.""Global recession risks have never been greater and that is bad news for the crude demand outlook. The initial move lower for crude however might not last as traders might grow confident this will be the last rate hike for the ECB and that next week the Fed will stop after delivering one more "" Oanda said.Metals:Gold prices rose early Friday  as traders sought safety in haven assets.Fresh concerns emerged about the financial sector  as First Republic Bank plunged  with the lender said to be exploring a sale  ANZ analysts said  adding that markets will carefully watch next week's Fed meeting.""The risk environment is still treading on some cautious optimism while 'dovish' rate expectations also remain supportive of the yellow metal "" IG said.--Copper prices rose early Friday buoyed by strong China data released earlier this week.Data showed that growth in fixed asset investments in China was picking up after the Lunar New Year  said ANZ analysts.Property investment in China has risen more-than-expected over January and February  ANZ added.--Chinese iron-ore futures gained  with some analysts warning of the ferrous metal's high valuation.The production of iron melt is unlikely to exceed last year's level  and steel mills are cautious of adding iron ore stock  Donghai Futures analysts said.They also expect iron ore supply to rebound in 2Q  which might further weigh on prices.TODAY'S TOP HEADLINESEleven Banks Deposit $30 Billion in First Republic BankThe biggest banks in the U.S. swooped in to rescue First Republic Bank with a flood of cash totaling $30 billion  in an effort to stop a spreading panic following a pair of recent bank failures.The bank's executives came together in recent days to formulate the plan  discussing it with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and other officials and regulators in Washington  D.C.  people familiar with the matter said.Don't Bet on a Fed Pause. Why a Rate Hike Is Still Likely.Turmoil in the banking sector went global on Wednesday  sending equity markets tumbling and sparking renewed calls for the Federal Reserve to pause its monetary-policy tightening efforts when officials meet next week.Despite widespread market volatility over the past several days  however  inflation remains well above the Fed's 2% target  particularly in the most-worrisome services sector  and the macroeconomic outlook so far is mostly unchanged. That suggests to many economists that the central bank  in its quest to balance its dual priorities of financial stability and price stability  is still likely to raise rates by a modest quarter of a percentage point when officials meet for their March policy meeting next week.U.S. stocks set for wild swings as trillions in options contracts set to expire FridayU.S. stocks could see increasingly wild swings in the coming days as option contracts tied to trillions of dollars in securities are set to expire on Friday  removing a buffer that some say has helped to keep the S&P 500 index from breaking out of a tight trading range.Option contracts worth $2.8 trillion are set to expire during Friday's ""quadruple witching"" event  according to figures from Goldman Sachs Group GS.Bursting Bubble Is Expected to Curb 2023 BonusesBonuses for private-equity executives will fall again this year after declining across much of the industry in 2022  with the heaviest cuts seen for smaller and midsize firms  according to Alan Johnson  managing director of Wall Street compensation consulting firm Johnson Associates Inc.However  the largest buyout shops may escape unscathed  he said.Poland Says Russian Spies Sought to Sabotage Western Arms Transfers to UkraineWARSAW-Poland's domestic security agency detained nine foreigners suspected of planning to sabotage Western weapons shipments to Ukraine  in the largest known attempt by Russia to target arms deliveries from within Europe.Interior Minister Mariusz Kami?ski said Thursday that the nine people  who have been detained in recent days  had been paid by Russian special services.China's Foreign Minister Talks With Ukraine Counterpart as Xi Plans Moscow TripChina's foreign minister on Thursday spoke by telephone with his Ukrainian counterpart as Beijing continues to signal its desire to play a part in ending that country's war with Russia.Qin Gang  the Chinese official  spoke with Ukraine's Dmytro Kuleba  both governments confirmed.U.N.

Situated...,The 5th episode of the 'Our Planet  Our Commitment' series zooms in on the initiatives to reduce single-use plastic for guests and make operations more sustainable at the Adagio  ibis & ibis budget São Bernardo do Campo in southeast Brazil.Situated on the edge of the Amazon Rainforest  São Bernardo do Campo is home to the vast Represa Billings dam that supplies water to 1 5 million people. In the city center  across 3 hotels  464 rooms  2 restaurants and 1 bar  the hotel teams strive to put sustainability and plastic alternatives at the heart of the guest experience and operations.

Plastic bags have been replaced by paper formats for guest laundry and removed from bins  saving more than 180 000 plastic bags a year.: single-dose toilet amenities have been replaced by refillable dispensers and guests are encouraged to use fewer other single-use amenities.

The effective date of the Ratio Change (the “Effective Date”) is expected to be March 30th  2023.Pursuant to the Ratio Change  as of the Effective Date  record holders who directly hold ADRs will be required to exchange their existing ADRs for new ADRs on the basis of one new ADR for every 10 existing ADRs surrendered. The Depositary will contact ADR holders and arrange for the exchange of their existing ADRs for new ADRs. ADS beneficial holders who hold through an ADR holder intermediary need not take any action in connection with the Ratio Change. For ADS holders  the Ratio Change will have the same effect as a one-for-ten reverse ADS split. The ADSs will continue to be traded on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “BPTS”.No new Shares will be issued in connection with the Ratio Change and this Ratio Change does not change the total number of Biophytis ordinary shares.As a result of the Ratio Change  the trading price of the Company’s ADSs is expected to automatically increase proportionally  but the Company can give no assurance that the ADS trading price following the Ratio Change will be at least equal to the ADS trading price before the Ratio Change multiplied by the new 10:1 ratio.Biophytis CEO Stanislas Veillet commented: “We believe the Ratio Change is in the best interest of all our stakeholders  as it will allow us to ensure Biophytis’ continued listing on Nasdaq and provide a pathway toward increasing Biophytis’ visibility on Nasdaq.”About BIOPHYTISBiophytis SA is a clinical-stage biotechnology company specialized in the development of therapeutics that are aimed at slowing the degenerative processes associated with aging and improving functional outcomes for patients suffering from age-related diseases  including severe respiratory failure in patients suffering from COVID-19.

Published earlier this month  the LegalVIEW Insights 2023-1 report found that corporate legal departments may hold more pricing negotiation power over both large and small law firms than previously realized  with approximately 32% of the timekeepers practicing inside the Am Law 100 receiving no rate increases at all during the period July 2021 to June 2022.Cemenska tells Legal Speak host Zack Needles that in-house legal teams can bolster their negotiating power with large- and medium-sized law firms alike by gradually building  testing  and – should the results warrant it – expanding their relationships with smaller  often less expensive firms. Growing a diverse portfolio of legal service providers takes time  but the investment can pay dividends.“Buyers at corporate law departments that have invested in cultivating relationships with a broad range of trusted law firm partners will find themselves in a strong position to negotiate rates ” Cemenska says. “However  that requires foresight in addition to an intimate understanding of an organization’s legal spend.”Owned and operated by ALM Media  Law.com is the hub connecting more than 18 online U.S. national and regional award-winning legal publications  including The American Lawyer and Legaltech News.

Photograph: EPAEuropean stocks came under renewed pressure on Friday as Thursday’s relief rally faded from view. Reports that four US banks would join forces to pump $30 billion (€28bn into stumbling lender First Republic failed to generate much optimism despite a brief early morning rally. Sentiment across global markets remained fragile in the aftermath of Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse one week ago.DUBLINIn a characteristically light St Patrick’s Day session on the Euronext Dublin  the Iseq index  down close to 2 per cent  gave back most of Thursday’s 2.3 per cent gain.Cardboard boxmaker Smurfit Kappa  down 3.4 per cent to €32.18 per share  was among the biggest movers on the day. Traders in Dublin said it was a sectoral move  with the company’s main British competitors in the packaging sector  Mondi and DS Smith  also weaker on the session.Having regained some lost ground on Thursday  Irish banks also came under pressure on Friday. Permanent TSB tumbled more than 5.5 per cent to close at €2.39  while AIB was off by 2.1 per cent to €3.54 per share. Bank of Ireland was trading at almost €8.95 by closing bell  down 1.1 per cent.READ MOREWeak macro sentiment was also in evidence in the travel and leisure sector. Ryanair followed most of its European peers  falling 2.8 per cent to €13.99. Hotel group Dalata was off by than 4.8 per cent to €4.09 per share  while Irish Ferries-owner Irish Continental Group gave back nearly 2.2 per cent €4.51.LONDONA flurry of optimism in London markets on Friday morning quickly ran out of steam  with the FTSE 100 index down 1 per cent on the session.As part of a wider trend in the European airline sector amid declining economic optimism  EasyJet shed more than 5.4 per cent  while Aer Lingus-owner IAG was off by close to 2.3 per cent. London-listed package holiday company Tui  down 5.7 per cent on the session  also felt the sting of pessimism  while hotel giant Intercontinental Group shed 2 per cent.Banks came in for more scrutiny from investors after Thursday’s rally  with Barclays  Lloyds and HSBC down between 2 and 3 per cent.Moving the other way  oil major Shell was up 0.2 per cent despite tumbling crude prices  while miners Anglo American and Glencore added 1 per cent and 2 per cent respectively.EUROPEBoth the pan-European Stoxx 600 and blue-chip Stoxx 50 indices turned around 1.2 per cent lower  with the French Cac 40 and the German Dax off by around 1.4 per cent.Shares in troubled Swiss lender Credit Suisse resumed a decline  falling as much as 13 per cent after the idea of a forced combination with a larger rival UBS was shot down. The stock had rallied 19 per cent Thursday after the Swiss central bank stepped in with support.The big names in banking all took a hit  with Spain’s Santander and BBVA down 4.6 per cent and 3.6 per cent  while Dutch ING also tumbled 3.6 per cent. France’s BNP Paribas  meanwhile  shed 2 per cent.German pharma giant Bayer and Dutch industrial Phillips  up between 0.3 and 0.5 per cent  were among the few larger-caps to finish in green.NEW YORKWall Street’s main indices fell more than 1 per cent on Friday as efforts to provide lifelines to some regional lenders failed to assuage investor fears of a broader banking crisis.Big banks including JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had stepped in to inject $30 billion into First Republic on Thursday  helping calm some nerves and lifting US stocks. The boost was short-lived  however  and fears of a banking crisis gripped the market on Friday  with shares of First Republic  which also suspended its dividend payout  dropping 24.5 per cent.The local fallout from Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse continued with its regional peer PacWest Bancorp  down 13.1 per cent  while Western Alliance slid 16.9 per cent.Big banks including JP Morgan  Citigroup and Wells Fargo also declined between 3 per cent and 4.1 per cent.On a mixed day for tech stocks Apple dipped 0.2 per cent  while Microsoft rose 1 per cent.

The average daily volume is currently approximately 800 000 shares per day  so the Paris listing clearly offers superior liquidity compared to the ...,MGPhotos/iStock via Getty ImagesIntroductionKlepierre (OTCPK:KLPEF) (OTCPK:KLPPY) is a French REIT focusing on commercial real estate. The REIT has done a good job in reducing its leverage  and as of the end of 2022  its LTV ratio stood at less than 38% despite having hiked the average capitalization rate of the assets by about 20 basis points. As several European REITs are plagued by the increasing interest rates (which weigh on the financial results and the value of the assets)  I will focus on how Klepierre manages this exposure.Yahoo FinanceKlepierre has its primary listing on Euronext Paris where it's trading with LI as its ticker symbol. The average daily volume is currently approximately 800 000 shares per day  so the Paris listing clearly offers superior liquidity compared to the secondary listings. I will use the EUR as the base currency throughout this article.The corporate website contains a few download-only links but all relevant data related to the results can be found here. The most recent corporate presentation can be found here.2022 was a successful year for the REITAs my focus in this article will be on balance sheet management and the impact of increasing interest rates  I will be relatively brief when it comes to the REIT's financial results in 2022.The REIT reported a net rental income of 1.04B EUR which is a substantial increase compared to the 880M EUR in 2021 as Klepierre was able to hike the rent while the COVID-related lease incentives rolled off throughout the year.The EPRA earnings and net current cash flow are obviously more important for a REIT than the net income is. As you can see below  the total amount of net current cash flow was 741M EUR or 2.59 EUR per share. This was however adjusted to 2.62 EUR due to an IFRS addition.Klepierre Investor RelationsWhile 2.62 EUR per share sounds great  let's not forget this includes two non-recurring items. First of all  there was a reversal of provisions and the reported current cash flow also includes the contribution from assets that have since been disposed of. The underlying net current cash flow was 2.24 EUR per share which means Klepierre is currently trading at about 10 times the underlying cash earnings.As 2022 was a good year  the REIT will also pay a very attractive dividend of 1.75 EUR per share. A first interim distribution of 87 cents will be paid on March 30 followed by an additional payment of 0.88 EUR with a payment date in July. That second portion of 88 cents will consist of a 4 cent 'normal' REIT distribution and 84 cents that will qualify as an equity repayment under the French tax system. This means that 91 eurocents will be subject to the standard French dividend withholding tax (12.8% if you complete the paperwork with your broker) while the remaining 84 cents should be tax free as it is a capital repayment.As of the end of December  the reported LTV ratio was just under 38%  and that's a pretty good result considering the REIT has started to slowly increase the capitalization rate of its assets. I think there's more work to do and additional cap rate increases are likely but I don't mind the gradual approach.Klepierre Investor RelationsAnd as you can see below  even a sudden 100 basis point shock to the discount rate and exit rate used to value the properties  the impact should be manageable.Klepierre Investor RelationsThe outlook for 2023 is pretty positive as wellKlepierre obviously also already released the guidance for 2023. The REIT expects to generate a net current cash flow of 2.35 EUR per share which would be about 5% higher than the 2.24 EUR generated in 2022. That's a pretty optimistic view in an investment climate where most REITs have to reduce their expectations for 2023 and beyond due to the increasing interest rates.This rather upbeat outlook (compared to peers) is caused by Klepierre's excellent financial management and debt management. As you can see below  the maturity dates of the existing debt is well-spread out over the next decade. This means that the average cost of debt will only gradually increase as existing debt has to be refinanced. So rather than seeing a 'shock' when for instance 2B EUR of debt would have to be refinanced  Klepierre has the luxury to see a gradual refinancing schedule.Klepierre Investor RelationsSo even if the average cost of debt for the 2023 and 2024 refinancings increases by 400 basis points  that's still an increase of just 56M EUR. Sure  that is an impact that will be felt further down the road as this represents approximately 20 cents per share but let's not forget the NOI of Klepierre's assets was about 1.04B EUR in FY 2022 with about 1.06B EUR per year if we would annualize the H2 results.This means that if Klepierre can hike the rent by on average 3% per year in 2023 and 2024  the entire impact of the interest rate increases will be covered. Of course that assumes there will be no sudden spikes in the other operating items. But in general  Klepierre's NOI and pre-financing recurring result will likely increase in line with the anticipated increase in interest expenses.Klepierre Investor RelationsAnd let's also not forget that the majority of the existing debt has been hedged. 100% of this year's exposure is hedged and even for 2024 the 90% hedge ratio provides excellent visibility going forward. And while the hedging ratio drops to just 68% by 2025  Klepierre will likely take additional action by then.And let's not forget that considering the recurring cash flow in 2022 was approximately 2.24 EUR per share  Klepierre is retaining about 50 cents per share per year. This means that - assuming the recurring earnings remain stable - Klepierre will be able to hoard about 400M EUR in earnings in the 2022-2025 era which provides the REIT with yet another tool: repaying a portion of the debt so the total amount of principal outstanding decreases. This won't really help the cost of debt (unless lenders see a substantial decrease in the LTV ratio) but it will help to keep the interest expenses (expressed in an absolute number) down.Investment thesisWhile a lot of REITs in Europe are now finally realizing the era of almost-free debt is over  Klepierre is actually in a good position. A large part of its debt has a fixed interest rate and seeing how the maturity dates are staggered  the refinancing agreements should not result in a sudden interest expense shock. Sure  the earnings will be under pressure the next few years as the increase in rental income and NOI will be needed to cover the higher interest expenses but I don't anticipate a massive earnings decrease in the next few years.The dividend is pretty attractive  not in the least because about half will be paid on a tax-free basis. Unless you think the entire commercial real estate space will collapse in the next few years  Klepierre still is attractive at the current valuation.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.
