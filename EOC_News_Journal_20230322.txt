Resolution regarding automatic share redemption procedure including a) share split 2:1  b) reduction of the share capital through redemption of shares and c) increase of the share capital through a bonus issue (item 21) Background Boliden has generated substantial cash flows over the past year and the financial position is strong. At the end of the year  the net debt/equity ratio was zero (0) per cent  which means that the balance sheet is stronger than Boliden's target of about 20 per cent at economic peaks. The Board proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves on an automatic share redemption  which will not jeopardise the ability to handle any deterioration in market terms nor the ability to finance additional growth. Through this  each existing share is split into two shares (share split 2:1)  whereof one of those shares will automatically be redeemed at SEK 11.50. In addition to the proposed ordinary dividend of approximately SEK 4 103 million  approximately SEK 3 145 million will be distributed to the shareholders through this procedure. The dividend and the redemption amount to a total of approximately SEK 7 248 million  or SEK 26.50 per share. To achieve a quick and efficient redemption procedure the Board further proposes that the company's share capital is restored to its current amount by means of a bonus issue. In view hereof  the Board proposes that the meeting resolves in accordance with the following proposal. 21 i) share split 2:1 The Board proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves on a share split 2:1  meaning that each existing share is divided into two shares  of which one is to be referred to as redemption share in the Euroclear system and be redeemed in the manner described under item b) below. The suggested record date at Euroclear for the share split is May 10  2023. The last trading day for the company's shares including the right to receive redemption shares will therefore be May 8  2023 and the first trading day for the company's shares excluding the right to receive redemption shares will be May 9  2023. After the share split  the number of shares in the company will increase from 273 511 169 to 547 022 338  each share with a quota value of approximately SEK 1.06. 21 ii) reduction of the share capital through redemption of shares The Board proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves that the company's share capital shall be reduced by SEK 289 457 169 (the reduction amount) for repayment to the shareholders. The reduction of the share capital will be made by means of redemption of 273 511 169 shares. The shares to be redeemed shall be those shares that  after the share split in accordance with item a) above  are referred to as redemption shares in the Euroclear system  whereby the record date for the right to receive redemption shares according to item a) above is May 10  2023. Trading in the redemption shares is estimated to take place as from May 11  2023 up to June 1  2023. For each redeemed share a redemption amount of SEK 11.50 will be paid in cash  of which approximately SEK 10.44 exceeds the quota value of the share. The total redemption amount is estimated to SEK 3 145 378 443.50. In addition to the reduction amount of SEK 289 457 169  an estimated amount of SEK 2 855 921 274.50 will be distributed  by use of the company's non-restricted equity. The record date for the right to receive the redemption amount is proposed to be June 5  2023. Payment of the redemption amount is estimated to be made by Euroclear on June 9  2023. Following the reduction  the company's share capital will amount to SEK 289 457 169  allocated on in total 273 511 169 shares  each share with a quota value of approximately SEK 1.06. Apart from the reduction of the share capital  the company's restricted equity will not be affected. 21 iii) increase of the share capital through a bonus issue Further  to achieve a quick and efficient redemption procedure without the requirement of obtaining the Swedish Companies Registration Office's or a general court's permission  the Board proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves on a bonus issue to increase the company's share capital by SEK 289 457 169  to SEK 578 914 338  through a transfer of SEK 289 457 169 from the company's non-restricted equity. No new shares are to be issued in connection with the bonus issue. The number of shares in the company will  after implementation of the increase of the share capital  be 273 511 169  each share with a quota value of approximately SEK 2.12. The resolutions by the Annual General Meeting in accordance with items a) – c) above are conditional upon each other and shall therefore be adopted as one resolution. In order for the resolution by the Annual General Meeting to be valid  the resolution must be approved by shareholders representing at least two thirds of the votes cast as well as the shares represented at the Annual General Meeting. Finally  the Board proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorises the company's President to make the minor adjustments to the resolutions in this item 21 that may be required in connection with the registration of the resolutions with the Swedish Companies Registration Office or Euroclear. The Board's statement pursuant to Chapter 20  Section 8 and Chapter 20  Section 13 of the Swedish Companies Act as well as the Auditor's statements pursuant to Chapter 20  Section 8 and Section 14 of the Swedish Companies Act are provided separately. A separate information brochure regarding the proposed automatic share redemption procedure in accordance with this item will be provided before the Annual General Meeting. Resolution on the implementation of a long-term share savings programme 2023/2026 (item 22a) and hedging arrangements related thereto (item 22b) Background The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves on a long-term share savings programme (the ""Programme"" or ""LTIP 2023/2026""). The Programme is aimed at the CEO  members of the Group Management  General Managers and certain other key employees in the Boliden Group and shall be implemented after Boliden's Annual General Meeting in 2023. The overall purpose of the Programme is to maintain a close community of interest between employees and shareholders by incentivising employees to increase the value of the company. The Programme is intended to attract and retain key employees. The programme should be achievable  easy to understand  cost-effective to administer and easy to communicate. 22 i) Implementation of the Programme The Board of Directors proposes to implement the Programme on the main terms set out below. a. The Programme is proposed to be directed to 17 permanent employees within the Boliden Group  which are divided into the following four categories: the CEO of Boliden (""Group 1"")  members of the Group Management (currently four persons) (""Group 2"")  General Managers (currently ten persons) (""Group 3"") and two other pre-identified key persons in the Boliden Group (""Group 4""). The participants in Groups 1-4 are together referred to as the ""Participants"". b. In order to participate in the Programme  the employees are required to personally invest in shares in Boliden  and that these shares are allocated to the Programme  or that shares already held in Boliden are allocated to the Programme1  which shall take place no later than 31 December 2023  unless the Board of Directors decides to postpone the date (""Investment Shares""). The Investment Shares shall be retained throughout the Vesting Period (as defined below). For each Investment Share  the Participants have the possibility to  free of charge  either by Boliden  by another company in the Boliden Group or by a designated third party  be allotted a maximum of three (3) shares in Boliden conditional upon continued employment and uninterrupted holding of Investment Shares and fulfilment of certain performance conditions (as further described in section (d) below) (""Performance Shares""). c. The Performance Shares will be granted after the expiry of a vesting period  which runs from and including 1 June 2023 up to and including 31 May 2026 (the ""Vesting Period""). d. The allotment of Performance Shares shall be dependent on the extent to which the performance conditions for the Programme have been fulfilled. The performance conditions shall consist of a financial target specific to the Programme related to the total shareholder return (""TSR"") for Boliden's share (the ""TSR Condition"") and a sustainability target (the ""Sustainability Condition"")  as further described below. The TSR Condition will be weighted with 80 per cent and the Sustainability Condition with 20 per cent when determining the allotment of Performance Shares. After the end of the Vesting Period  the Board of Directors will publish the extent to which the TSR Condition and the Sustainability Conditions have been fulfilled. The TSR Condition shall be related to the TSR of Boliden's share during a period of 20 trading days after Boliden's publication of the year-end report for the financial year 2022 compared to 20 trading days after Boliden's publication of the year-end report for the financial year 2025 (the ""Measurement Period"") in relation to the TSR of a peer group of other companies.2 A condition for allotment of Performance Shares under the TSR Condition is that the TSR for Boliden's share exceeds the weighted TSR outcome for the peer group during the Measurement Period (the ""TSR Minimum Level""). If the TSR Minimum Level is not achieved  no allotment of Performance Shares related to the TSR Condition will be made. For maximum allotment (100 per cent)  the TSR for Boliden's share must exceed the weighted TSR outcome for the peer group by at least 12.5 percentage points during the Measurement Period (the ""TSR Maximum Level""). If the TSR for Boliden's share amounts to between the TSR Minimum Level and the TSR Maximum Level during the Measurement Period  a linear allocation is made. The Sustainability Condition shall be related to the reduction of Boliden's carbon dioxide emissions in absolute terms. A condition for allotment of Performance Shares under the Sustainability Condition is that Boliden's carbon dioxide emissions in absolute terms (Scope 1 and Scope 2 according to the Green-house Gas Protocol) during the financial year 2025 have been reduced by at least 12 per cent compared to Boliden's carbon dioxide emissions in absolute terms during the financial year 2021.3 e. Participants in Group 1-2 may invest in Investment Shares at a value corresponding to a maximum of 15 per cent of the Participant's annual gross fixed base salary for 2023. Participants in Group 3-4 may invest in Investment Shares at a value corresponding to a maximum of 10 per cent of the Participant's annual gross fixed base salary for 2023. The number of Investment Shares that Participants may acquire is determined on the basis of the volume-weighted average share price of the Boliden share during a period of 20 trading days after Boliden's publication of the year-end report for the financial year 2022. f. Performance Shares may normally only be allotted after the end of the Vesting Period. The total value of Performance Shares allotted to Participants may not exceed 150 per cent of the Participant's annual individual gross fixed base salary for 2026 (the ""Cap""). The value of the Performance Shares for calculation of the Cap is determined based on the volume weighted average share price of the Boliden share during a period of 20 trading days prior to the end of the Vesting Period. g. For a Participant to be allotted Performance Shares  it shall normally have been a permanent employee within the Boliden Group during the entire Vesting Period  and have retained the Investment Shares until the end of the Vesting Period. Investment Shares disposed of before the end of the Vesting Period shall not be included in the calculation for determining the allotment of Performance Shares. h. If there are significant changes in the Boliden Group or in the market which  in the opinion of the Board of Directors  would mean that the conditions for allotment of Performance Shares under the Programme are no longer reasonable  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to make adjustments to the Programme  including  inter alia  a right to resolve on a reduced allotment of Performance Shares  or that no allotment of Performance Shares shall take place at all. i. The Board of Directors shall be entitled to decide on the detailed terms and conditions of the Programme. In this respect  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to make necessary adjustments to these terms and conditions in order to fulfil specific rules or market conditions outside Sweden. j. Participation in the Programme is contingent upon such participation being legal in the relevant jurisdictions. Where  in the Board's opinion  Participants outside Sweden cannot be allotted Performance Shares at a reasonable cost or with reasonable administrative efforts  it shall be entitled to decide on a cash settlement for such Participants. k. The Programme shall comprise a maximum of 40 000 Performance Shares in Boliden. l. The number of Performance Shares shall be subject to recalculation to take into account any intervening bonus issues  splits  rights issues  dividend exceeding 15 per cent of the Group's equity for a given financial year and/or other similar corporate events. Costs of the Programme  etc.The costs for the Programme  which are recognised in the income statement  are calculated in accordance with the accounting standard IFRS 2 and are accrued over the Vesting Period. The calculation has been carried out based on the quoted closing price for shares in Boliden as of 15 February 2023  i.e. SEK 437.4 per share  and with the following assumptions: (i) an annual dividend yield of approximately 5 per cent  (ii) an annual employee turnover of approximately 7 per cent  (iii) fulfilment of the TSR Condition of 100 per cent and fulfilment of the Sustainability Condition  (iv) all 17 Participants invest the maximum amount in the Programme  (v) all remaining Participants are entitled to allotment of the maximum number of Performance Shares in the Programme  (vi) a tax rate for social security contributions of 28 per cent  and (vii) a total maximum of 40 000 Performance Shares available for allotment. Based on the above assumptions  the total costs for the Programme under IFRS 2 are estimated to amount to approximately SEK 9 million  excluding social security contributions. Assuming an annual share price increase of 15 per cent during the term of the Programme  the costs for social security contributions are estimated to amount to approximately SEK 7 million. Assuming instead an annual share price increase of 30 per cent during the duration of the Programme  the costs for social security contributions are estimated to amount to approximately SEK 10 million. Based on the above assumptions (and an annual share price increase of 15 per cent for calculation of the social security contributions)  the yearly costs are estimated to amount to approximately SEK 5.3 million  including social security contributions. This corresponds to approximately 0.1 per cent of the Boliden Group's total personnel costs for the financial year 2022. DilutionThe allotment of repurchased shares to fulfil the obligations under the Programme would result in the following dilution effects (under the assumptions stated below). At the maximum allotment of Performance Shares  the number of shares to be allotted free of charge in the Programme amounts to 40 000 shares in Boliden  which corresponds to approximately 0.01 per cent of the shares and votes (calculated based on the number of outstanding shares in Boliden as of 15 February 2023). The effects on key ratios and earnings per share are thus marginal. Hedging arrangementsIn order to be able to implement the Programme in a cost-efficient and flexible manner  the Board of Directors has considered different methods for delivery of Performance Shares. The Board of Directors has thereby found the most cost-efficient alternative to be  and therefore proposes that the Annual General Meeting as a main alternative resolves on  repurchase and transfer of treasury shares. The Company currently holds no treasury shares. The detailed terms and conditions for the Board of Directors' main alternative are set out in section 22.b.i below. Should the required majority for item 22.b.i below not be reached  the Board of Directors proposes that Boliden shall be able to enter into equity swap agreements with third parties in accordance with item 22.b.ii below. Preparation of the proposalThe proposed Programme has  according to guidelines issued by Boliden's Board of Directors  been prepared by Boliden's Remuneration Committee  with the assistance of external advisors. The Remuneration Committee has presented the work to the Board of Directors  after which the Board of Directors has decided to propose that the Programme is adopted at the Annual General Meeting 2023. 22 ii) Hedging arrangements in respect of the Programme a. Decisions on acquisitions and transfers of treasury shares The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting (a) authorise the Board of Directors to resolve on acquisitions of treasury shares on Nasdaq Stockholm and (b) resolve that treasury shares may be transferred to the Participants in the Programme. a) The acquisition of treasury shares is subject to the following terms: i. Purchases of treasury shares may only be made on Nasdaq Stockholm. ii. A maximum of 40 000 shares may be acquired to ensure delivery of shares to Participants. iii. Acquisitions of shares in Boliden on Nasdaq Stockholm may only be made at a price within the price interval applicable from time to time on Nasdaq Stockholm  i.e. the interval between the highest buying price and the lowest selling price on Nasdaq Stockholm from time to time. iv. The authorisation may be exercised on one or more occasions until the Annual General Meeting in 2024. b) The transfer of Boliden's treasury shares to the Participants may take place under the following terms: i. A maximum of 40 000 shares in Boliden may be transferred free of charge to the Participants. ii. The right to acquire shares in Boliden free of charge shall  with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  be granted to the Participants  with a right for each Participant to acquire a maximum number of shares in accordance with the terms of the Programme. Furthermore  with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  subsidiaries of Boliden shall be entitled to acquire shares in Boliden free of charge  whereby such company shall be obliged to  according to the terms of the Programme  immediately transfer the shares to the Participants. iii. Transfers of shares in Boliden shall be made free of charge at the time and on the other terms and conditions that the Participants are entitled to be allocated shares. iv. The number of shares in Boliden that may be transferred under the Programme shall be subject to recalculation to take into account any intervening bonus issues  splits  rights issues  dividend exceeding 15 per cent of the Group's equity for a given financial year and/or other similar corporate events. The transfer of own shares is part of the proposed Programme and the Board of Directors considers it to be beneficial to Boliden and the shareholders that Participants in the Programme are offered the opportunity to become shareholders under the terms of the Programme. b. Equity swap agreement with a third party The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting  in the event that the required majority for item 22.b.i above cannot be reached  resolve to hedge the financial exposure that the Programme is expected to entail by enabling Boliden to enter into an equity swap agreement with a third party on terms in accordance with market practice  whereby the third party undertakes  in its own name and in exchange for a fee  to acquire and transfer shares in Boliden to the Participants in accordance with the terms of the Programme. Majority requirements  etc. The Annual General Meeting's resolution to implement the Programme in accordance with item 22.a. above is conditional upon the Annual General Meeting resolving either in accordance with the proposal under item 22.b.i or the proposal under item 22.b.ii. The Annual General Meeting's resolution under item 22.a above requires a simple majority of the votes cast. A valid resolution under item 22.b.i above requires that shareholders representing not less than nine-tenths of the votes cast as well as of the shares represented at the Annual General Meeting approve the resolution. A valid resolution under item 22.b.ii above requires a simple majority of the votes cast. Resolution regarding guidelines for remuneration to Group Management (item 23) The Board of Directors proposes the following guidelines for remuneration to the company's Group Management. While the Board of Directors proposes some adjustments  the proposal is essentially in accordance with the guidelines adopted by the Annual General Meeting in previous years. These guidelines apply to the President and other members of Group Management. The guidelines set out the principles applied by the company with regard to their remuneration. The guidelines' promotion of the company's strategy  long-term interests and sustainability Information regarding the company's strategy can be found in the annual report. In order to successfully implement the strategy and safeguard the company's long-term interests  including its sustainability  the company must be able to recruit and retain qualified employees. To do so  the company must be able to offer competitive remuneration. These guidelines enable a competitive remuneration package to be offered to Group Management. Forms of remuneration  etc. The total remuneration shall be on market terms and shall comprise fixed salary  variable cash compensation  pension benefits and other benefits. In addition  members of the Group Management may be offered long-term share-related incentive programmes. Any such programme is decided by the general meeting and is therefore not covered by these guidelines. The Board of Directors evaluates annually whether a share-related incentive programme should be proposed to the General Meeting. Any long-term share-related incentive programme shall have a clear link to the business strategy and be designed with the aim of aligning the interests of the shareholders and the participants for long-term value creation. (i) Fixed salary The fixed salary shall be determined on the basis of factors including competence  responsibilities  experience and performance. The Group uses an internationally recognised evaluation system to determine the scope and level of responsibility of executive positions. Comparisons are made with similar companies. Such evaluation is performed annually by the Remuneration Committee and forms the basis for its decisions and the proposed fixed salary for the President that the Committee submits to the Board of Directors for approval. (ii) Variable cash compensation The variable cash compensation shall not exceed 60 per cent of the fixed salary and shall be linked to predefined  measurable criteria  which may be financial or non-financial. Some of the criteria may consist of quantitative or qualitative goals that are specific to the individual. The criteria shall be designed in such a way as to promote the company's strategy and long-term interests. The Board of Directors shall have the possibility  subject to the limitations that may result from by law or agreement  to demand repayment of variable cash compensation paid on erroneous grounds (claw back). Once the annual accounts have been approved by the Board of Directors  an assessment is made of the extent to which the criteria have been met. The Board of Directors is responsible  following the preparatory work of the Remuneration Committee  for such assessment in respect of variable cash compensation to the President. The President is responsible for the assessment in respect of other executives. (iii) Pension benefits The pension benefits for the President and other members of the Group Management shall be defined contribution. The variable cash compensation shall not be included in the basis for calculation of pension. Pension contributions shall not exceed 35 per cent of the fixed annual cash salary. For other members of the Group Management  the defined contribution solution does not include costs for ITP's base plan (Sw. ITPS bottenplatta)  ITPK  part-time pension and supplementary health insurance. (iv) Other benefits Other benefits may include health insurance and company car benefit. Premiums and other costs related to such benefits may not in total exceed 15 per cent of the fixed annual cash salary. Mandatory legal and collective agreement provisions Nothing in these guidelines shall restrict mandatory legislation or collective agreement provisions  where these are applicable. Termination of employment A notice period of six months applies to termination of employment by a member of Group Management. On termination of employment by the company  the total remuneration during the notice period and severance compensation  if any  shall not exceed 18 months' fixed salary. Salary and terms of employment for employees In the preparation of the Board's proposal for these remuneration guidelines  the salary and terms of employment of the company's employees shall be taken into account by information concerning the total remuneration of employees  the components of the remuneration and the increase and rate of increase in remuneration over time having been part of the decision-making basis for the Remuneration Committee and the Board of Directors in evaluating the reasonableness of the guidelines and the limitations arising from them. The decision-making process for establishing  evaluating and implementing the guidelines The Board of Directors has established a Remuneration Committee. The Committee's tasks include preparing the Board's resolution on the proposed guidelines for remuneration to Group Management. The Board of Directors shall draw up proposals for new guidelines at least every four years and submit these proposals for resolution at the Annual General Meeting. The guidelines shall apply until new guidelines are adopted by the General Meeting. The Remuneration Committee submits proposals to the Board of Directors regarding remuneration  etc. to the President. Furthermore  the Remuneration Committee prepares principles for remuneration to the Group Management and approves  on proposal from the President  remuneration  etc. to the Group Management. The Remuneration Committee shall also monitor and evaluate variable compensation schemes for Group Management  the application of remuneration guidelines for Group Management and current remuneration structures and levels of remuneration within the company. The President and other members of Group Management shall not be in attendance during the Board of Directors' consideration and decisions on matters relating to their remuneration. Departure from the guidelines The Board of Directors may decide to depart temporarily from the guidelines  in whole or in part  where there are particular reasons for doing so in an individual case and where such departure is necessary in order to safeguard the long-term interests of the company  including its sustainability  or to ensure the company's financial viability. Significant changes to the guidelines and how shareholders' views have been taken into account The Board of Director's proposal to the Annual General Meeting 2023 does not entail any significant changes in relation to the guidelines adopted in 2020. However  some adjustments have been made in order to reflect that member of the Group Management can be offered long-term share-related incentive programmes decided by the General Meeting. The design of variable cash remuneration from 2023 is no longer linked to the individual investing in additional shares in the company for part of the variable cash remuneration. At the 2022 Annual General Meeting  no comments were made by shareholders regarding the guidelines. The company has thus not had to consider any comments during the year. Shares and Votes The company's share capital amounts to SEK 578 914 338 distributed among 273 511 169 shares and votes. The company holds no own shares.

Volume-weighted average share prices during a period of 20 trading days after Boliden's publication of the year-end report for the financial year 2022 are compared with volume-weighted average share prices during a period of 20 trading days after Boliden's publication of the year-end report for the financial year 2025  with the addition of dividends and other returns. Upon implementation of the Programme  the peer group consists of the following companies: Antofagasta  Aurubis  Lundin Mining  First Quantum  Fresnillo  KGHM  Korea Zinc and TECK. The peer group may be adjusted as decided by the Board of Directors if the Board of Directors finds it appropriate. 3 Boliden aims to have 40 per cent lower absolute carbon dioxide emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 2 according to the Green-house Gas Protocol) in 2030 compared to the base year 2021. The emission target for 2030 is expected to be validated by the Science Based Target Initiative (""SBTi"") during the second half of 2023. The validation process may lead to the Sustainability Condition being adjusted. However  any such adjustment must be approved by the Board of Directors and will be communicated by Boliden.

Item 14 The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolve to reduce the share capital by cancellation of the 550 508 shares currently held by Alfa Laval AB. The Board of Directors proposes that the reduction amount is transferred to the company's non-restricted equity  whereby the share capital is reduced by SEK 1 485 377.34. The 550 508 shares held by Alfa Laval AB  refer to such shares repurchased during the period from March 21  2022  in connection with the publication of the notice to the Annual General Meeting 2022  and the 2022 Annual General Meeting.

To restore the share capital after the reduction of the share capital  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting simultaneously resolves to increase the share capital by SEK 1 485 377.34 by way of a bonus issue without issuing new shares. The reduction amount is proposed to be transferred from the company's non-restricted equity. The Board of Director's report in accordance with Chapter 20  Section 13 of the Swedish Companies Act: The effect of the Board of Directors' proposal on reduction of the share capital is that the company's share capital and restricted equity will be reduced by SEK 1 485 377.34. The effect of the Board of Directors' proposal regarding increase of the share capital by way of a bonus issue is that the share capital and restricted equity will be increased by SEK 1 485 377.34. Thus  the combined effect is that neither the company's share capital nor the restricted equity is reduced. The auditors' statement in accordance with Chapter 20  Section 14 of the Swedish companies Act is included in the material for the Annual General Meeting. Item 15 The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves on an amendment of the Executive remuneration policy for executive officers that was adopted by the Annual general Meeting 2021. The proposed amendment has been marked below. Executive remuneration policy The executive officers  i.e. the CEO and other members of Group Management reporting to the CEO  fall within the provisions of this policy. The policy is forward-looking  i.e. applicable to remuneration agreed  and amendments to remuneration already agreed  after adoption of the policy by the annual general meeting in April 2023. This policy does not apply to any remuneration decided or approved by the general meeting. This policy is substantially in line with the policy adopted in 2021  however  with the addition of a possibility for the Board of Directors to delegate decision-making under the policy to its Remuneration Committee. A prerequisite for the successful implementation of the company's business strategy and safeguarding of its long-term interests  including its sustainability  is that the company is able to recruit and retain qualified personnel  consequently it is necessary that the company offers market competitive remuneration.

In the event of a restructuring of the Company or any other extraordinary event which the Remuneration Committee considers will affect the value of an award  the method of calculating the proportion of the maximum value of the award which will be paid to a Participant on vesting may be adjusted in such manner as the Remuneration Committee shall determine to be fair and reasonable. Opportunity Levels For executive officers the maximum opportunity for LTIP can amount up to 40% of fixed base salary for each three-year performance period.

Under the authorisation  a maximum of 281 828 shares may be issued for the implementation of the company’s incentive schemes  which corresponds to approximately 1.4% of all registered shares in the company calculated based on the number of shares on the date of the notice convening the General Meeting.Under the authorisation  the board of directors may issue either new shares or treasury shares. The board of directors would be authorised to decide on all other conditions of the issuance of shares and/or option rights or other special rights.It is proposed that the authorisation be valid until the end of the next annual General Meeting  but for no more than 18 months from the General Meeting’s resolution on the authorisation.19.

At the end of the year  the net debt/equity ratio was zero (0) per cent  which means that the balance sheet is stronger than Boliden's target of about 20 per cent at economic peaks. The Board proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves on an automatic share redemption  which will not jeopardise the ability to handle any deterioration in market terms nor the ability to finance additional growth. Through this  each existing share is split into two shares (share split 2:1)  whereof one of those shares will automatically be redeemed at SEK 11.50. In addition to the proposed ordinary dividend of approximately SEK 4 103 million  approximately SEK 3 145 million will be distributed to the shareholders through this procedure. The dividend and the redemption amount to a total of approximately SEK 7 248 million  or SEK 26.50 per share. To achieve a quick and efficient redemption procedure the Board further proposes that the company's share capital is restored to its current amount by means of a bonus issue. In view hereof  the Board proposes that the meeting resolves in accordance with the following proposal.21 i) share split 2:1The Board proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves on a share split 2:1  meaning that each existing share is divided into two shares  of which one is to be referred to as redemption share in the Euroclear system and be redeemed in the manner described under item b) below. The suggested record date at Euroclear for the share split is May 10  2023. The last trading day for the company's shares including the right to receive redemption shares will therefore be May 8  2023 and the first trading day for the company's shares excluding the right to receive redemption shares will be May 9  2023. After the share split  the number of shares in the company will increase from 273 511 169 to 547 022 338  each share with a quota value of approximately SEK 1.06.21 ii) reduction of the share capital through redemption of sharesThe Board proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves that the company's share capital shall be reduced by SEK 289 457 169 (the reduction amount) for repayment to the shareholders. The reduction of the share capital will be made by means of redemption of 273 511 169 shares.The shares to be redeemed shall be those shares that  after the share split in accordance with item a) above  are referred to as redemption shares in the Euroclear system  whereby the record date for the right to receive redemption shares according to item a) above is May 10  2023. Trading in the redemption shares is estimated to take place as from May 11  2023 up to June 1  2023.For each redeemed share a redemption amount of SEK 11.50 will be paid in cash  of which approximately SEK 10.44 exceeds the quota value of the share. The total redemption amount is estimated to SEK 3 145 378 443.50. In addition to the reduction amount of SEK 289 457 169  an estimated amount of SEK 2 855 921 274.50 will be distributed  by use of the company's non-restricted equity. The record date for the right to receive the redemption amount is proposed to be June 5  2023. Payment of the redemption amount is estimated to be made by Euroclear on June 9  2023.Following the reduction  the company's share capital will amount to SEK 289 457 169  allocated on in total 273 511 169 shares  each share with a quota value of approximately SEK 1.06. Apart from the reduction of the share capital  the company's restricted equity will not be affected.21 iii) increase of the share capital through a bonus issueFurther  to achieve a quick and efficient redemption procedure without the requirement of obtaining the Swedish Companies Registration Office's or a general court's permission  the Board proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves on a bonus issue to increase the company's share capital by SEK 289 457 169  to SEK 578 914 338  through a transfer of SEK 289 457 169 from the company's non-restricted equity. No new shares are to be issued in connection with the bonus issue.The number of shares in the company will  after implementation of the increase of the share capital  be 273 511 169  each share with a quota value of approximately SEK 2.12.The resolutions by the Annual General Meeting in accordance with items a) – c) above are conditional upon each other and shall therefore be adopted as one resolution. In order for the resolution by the Annual General Meeting to be valid  the resolution must be approved by shareholders representing at least two thirds of the votes cast as well as the shares represented at the Annual General Meeting.Finally  the Board proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorises the company's President to make the minor adjustments to the resolutions in this item 21 that may be required in connection with the registration of the resolutions with the Swedish Companies Registration Office or Euroclear.The Board's statement pursuant to Chapter 20  Section 8 and Chapter 20  Section 13 of the Swedish Companies Act as well as the Auditor's statements pursuant to Chapter 20  Section 8 and Section 14 of the Swedish Companies Act are provided separately.A separate information brochure regarding the proposed automatic share redemption procedure in accordance with this item will be provided before the Annual General Meeting.Resolution on the implementation of a long-term share savings programme 2023/2026 (item 22a) and hedging arrangements related thereto (item 22b)BackgroundThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves on a long-term share savings programme (the ""Programme"" or ""LTIP 2023/2026""). The Programme is aimed at the CEO  members of the Group Management  General Managers and certain other key employees in the Boliden Group and shall be implemented after Boliden's Annual General Meeting in 2023.The overall purpose of the Programme is to maintain a close community of interest between employees and shareholders by incentivising employees to increase the value of the company.

In order to participate in the Programme  the employees are required to personally invest in shares in Boliden  and that these shares are allocated to the Programme  or that shares already held in Boliden are allocated to the Programme1  which shall take place no later than 31 December 2023  unless the Board of Directors decides to postpone the date (""Investment Shares""). The Investment Shares shall be retained throughout the Vesting Period (as defined below). For each Investment Share  the Participants have the possibility to  free of charge  either by Boliden  by another company in the Boliden Group or by a designated third party  be allotted a maximum of three (3) shares in Boliden conditional upon continued employment and uninterrupted holding of Investment Shares and fulfilment of certain performance conditions (as further described in section (d) below) (""Performance Shares"").c. The Performance Shares will be granted after the expiry of a vesting period  which runs from and including 1 June 2023 up to and including 31 May 2026 (the ""Vesting Period"").d. The allotment of Performance Shares shall be dependent on the extent to which the performance conditions for the Programme have been fulfilled. The performance conditions shall consist of a financial target specific to the Programme related to the total shareholder return (""TSR"") for Boliden's share (the ""TSR Condition"") and a sustainability target (the ""Sustainability Condition"")  as further described below. The TSR Condition will be weighted with 80 per cent and the Sustainability Condition with 20 per cent when determining the allotment of Performance Shares. After the end of the Vesting Period  the Board of Directors will publish the extent to which the TSR Condition and the Sustainability Conditions have been fulfilled.The TSR Condition shall be related to the TSR of Boliden's share during a period of 20 trading days after Boliden's publication of the year-end report for the financial year 2022 compared to 20 trading days after Boliden's publication of the year-end report for the financial year 2025 (the ""Measurement Period"") in relation to the TSR of a peer group of other companies.2A condition for allotment of Performance Shares under the TSR Condition is that the TSR for Boliden's share exceeds the weighted TSR outcome for the peer group during the Measurement Period (the ""TSR Minimum Level""). If the TSR Minimum Level is not achieved  no allotment of Performance Shares related to the TSR Condition will be made. For maximum allotment (100 per cent)  the TSR for Boliden's share must exceed the weighted TSR outcome for the peer group by at least 12.5 percentage points during the Measurement Period (the ""TSR Maximum Level""). If the TSR for Boliden's share amounts to between the TSR Minimum Level and the TSR Maximum Level during the Measurement Period  a linear allocation is made.The Sustainability Condition shall be related to the reduction of Boliden's carbon dioxide emissions in absolute terms. A condition for allotment of Performance Shares under the Sustainability Condition is that Boliden's carbon dioxide emissions in absolute terms (Scope 1 and Scope 2 according to the Green-house Gas Protocol) during the financial year 2025 have been reduced by at least 12 per cent compared to Boliden's carbon dioxide emissions in absolute terms during the financial year 2021.3e. Participants in Group 1-2 may invest in Investment Shares at a value corresponding to a maximum of 15 per cent of the Participant's annual gross fixed base salary for 2023. Participants in Group 3-4 may invest in Investment Shares at a value corresponding to a maximum of 10 per cent of the Participant's annual gross fixed base salary for 2023. The number of Investment Shares that Participants may acquire is determined on the basis of the volume-weighted average share price of the Boliden share during a period of 20 trading days after Boliden's publication of the year-end report for the financial year 2022.f. Performance Shares may normally only be allotted after the end of the Vesting Period. The total value of Performance Shares allotted to Participants may not exceed 150 per cent of the Participant's annual individual gross fixed base salary for 2026 (the ""Cap""). The value of the Performance Shares for calculation of the Cap is determined based on the volume weighted average share price of the Boliden share during a period of 20 trading days prior to the end of the Vesting Period.g. For a Participant to be allotted Performance Shares  it shall normally have been a permanent employee within the Boliden Group during the entire Vesting Period  and have retained the Investment Shares until the end of the Vesting Period. Investment Shares disposed of before the end of the Vesting Period shall not be included in the calculation for determining the allotment of Performance Shares.h. If there are significant changes in the Boliden Group or in the market which  in the opinion of the Board of Directors  would mean that the conditions for allotment of Performance Shares under the Programme are no longer reasonable  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to make adjustments to the Programme  including  inter alia  a right to resolve on a reduced allotment of Performance Shares  or that no allotment of Performance Shares shall take place at all.i. The Board of Directors shall be entitled to decide on the detailed terms and conditions of the Programme. In this respect  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to make necessary adjustments to these terms and conditions in order to fulfil specific rules or market conditions outside Sweden.j. Participation in the Programme is contingent upon such participation being legal in the relevant jurisdictions. Where  in the Board's opinion  Participants outside Sweden cannot be allotted Performance Shares at a reasonable cost or with reasonable administrative efforts  it shall be entitled to decide on a cash settlement for such Participants.k. The Programme shall comprise a maximum of 40 000 Performance Shares in Boliden.l. The number of Performance Shares shall be subject to recalculation to take into account any intervening bonus issues  splits  rights issues  dividend exceeding 15 per cent of the Group's equity for a given financial year and/or other similar corporate events.Costs of the Programme  etc.The costs for the Programme  which are recognised in the income statement  are calculated in accordance with the accounting standard IFRS 2 and are accrued over the Vesting Period. The calculation has been carried out based on the quoted closing price for shares in Boliden as of 15 February 2023  i.e. SEK 437.4 per share  and with the following assumptions: (i) an annual dividend yield of approximately 5 per cent  (ii) an annual employee turnover of approximately 7 per cent  (iii) fulfilment of the TSR Condition of 100 per cent and fulfilment of the Sustainability Condition  (iv) all 17 Participants invest the maximum amount in the Programme  (v) all remaining Participants are entitled to allotment of the maximum number of Performance Shares in the Programme  (vi) a tax rate for social security contributions of 28 per cent  and (vii) a total maximum of 40 000 Performance Shares available for allotment.Based on the above assumptions  the total costs for the Programme under IFRS 2 are estimated to amount to approximately SEK 9 million  excluding social security contributions. Assuming an annual share price increase of 15 per cent during the term of the Programme  the costs for social security contributions are estimated to amount to approximately SEK 7 million. Assuming instead an annual share price increase of 30 per cent during the duration of the Programme  the costs for social security contributions are estimated to amount to approximately SEK 10 million.Based on the above assumptions (and an annual share price increase of 15 per cent for calculation of the social security contributions)  the yearly costs are estimated to amount to approximately SEK 5.3 million  including social security contributions. This corresponds to approximately 0.1 per cent of the Boliden Group's total personnel costs for the financial year 2022.DilutionThe allotment of repurchased shares to fulfil the obligations under the Programme would result in the following dilution effects (under the assumptions stated below). At the maximum allotment of Performance Shares  the number of shares to be allotted free of charge in the Programme amounts to 40 000 shares in Boliden  which corresponds to approximately 0.01 per cent of the shares and votes (calculated based on the number of outstanding shares in Boliden as of 15 February 2023). The effects on key ratios and earnings per share are thus marginal.Hedging arrangementsIn order to be able to implement the Programme in a cost-efficient and flexible manner  the Board of Directors has considered different methods for delivery of Performance Shares. The Board of Directors has thereby found the most cost-efficient alternative to be  and therefore proposes that the Annual General Meeting as a main alternative resolves on  repurchase and transfer of treasury shares. The Company currently holds no treasury shares. The detailed terms and conditions for the Board of Directors' main alternative are set out in section 22.b.i below.Should the required majority for item 22.b.i below not be reached  the Board of Directors proposes that Boliden shall be able to enter into equity swap agreements with third parties in accordance with item 22.b.ii below.Preparation of the proposalThe proposed Programme has  according to guidelines issued by Boliden's Board of Directors  been prepared by Boliden's Remuneration Committee  with the assistance of external advisors. The Remuneration Committee has presented the work to the Board of Directors  after which the Board of Directors has decided to propose that the Programme is adopted at the Annual General Meeting 2023.22 ii) Hedging arrangements in respect of the Programmea. Decisions on acquisitions and transfers of treasury sharesThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting (a) authorise the Board of Directors to resolve on acquisitions of treasury shares on Nasdaq Stockholm and (b) resolve that treasury shares may be transferred to the Participants in the Programme.a) The acquisition of treasury shares is subject to the following terms:i. Purchases of treasury shares may only be made on Nasdaq Stockholm.ii. A maximum of 40 000 shares may be acquired to ensure delivery of shares to Participants.iii. Acquisitions of shares in Boliden on Nasdaq Stockholm may only be made at a price within the price interval applicable from time to time on Nasdaq Stockholm  i.e. the interval between the highest buying price and the lowest selling price on Nasdaq Stockholm from time to time.iv. The authorisation may be exercised on one or more occasions until the Annual General Meeting in 2024.b) The transfer of Boliden's treasury shares to the Participants may take place under the following terms:i. A maximum of 40 000 shares in Boliden may be transferred free of charge to the Participants.ii. The right to acquire shares in Boliden free of charge shall  with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  be granted to the Participants  with a right for each Participant to acquire a maximum number of shares in accordance with the terms of the Programme. Furthermore  with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  subsidiaries of Boliden shall be entitled to acquire shares in Boliden free of charge  whereby such company shall be obliged to  according to the terms of the Programme  immediately transfer the shares to the Participants.iii. Transfers of shares in Boliden shall be made free of charge at the time and on the other terms and conditions that the Participants are entitled to be allocated shares.iv. The number of shares in Boliden that may be transferred under the Programme shall be subject to recalculation to take into account any intervening bonus issues  splits  rights issues  dividend exceeding 15 per cent of the Group's equity for a given financial year and/or other similar corporate events.The transfer of own shares is part of the proposed Programme and the Board of Directors considers it to be beneficial to Boliden and the shareholders that Participants in the Programme are offered the opportunity to become shareholders under the terms of the Programme.b. Equity swap agreement with a third partyThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting  in the event that the required majority for item 22.b.i above cannot be reached  resolve to hedge the financial exposure that the Programme is expected to entail by enabling Boliden to enter into an equity swap agreement with a third party on terms in accordance with market practice  whereby the third party undertakes  in its own name and in exchange for a fee  to acquire and transfer shares in Boliden to the Participants in accordance with the terms of the Programme.Majority requirements  etc.The Annual General Meeting's resolution to implement the Programme in accordance with item 22.a. above is conditional upon the Annual General Meeting resolving either in accordance with the proposal under item 22.b.i or the proposal under item 22.b.ii.The Annual General Meeting's resolution under item 22.a above requires a simple majority of the votes cast. A valid resolution under item 22.b.i above requires that shareholders representing not less than nine-tenths of the votes cast as well as of the shares represented at the Annual General Meeting approve the resolution. A valid resolution under item 22.b.ii above requires a simple majority of the votes cast.Resolution regarding guidelines for remuneration to Group Management (item 23)The Board of Directors proposes the following guidelines for remuneration to the company's Group Management. While the Board of Directors proposes some adjustments  the proposal is essentially in accordance with the guidelines adopted by the Annual General Meeting in previous years.These guidelines apply to the President and other members of Group Management. The guidelines set out the principles applied by the company with regard to their remuneration.The guidelines' promotion of the company's strategy  long-term interests and sustainabilityInformation regarding the company's strategy can be found in the annual report. In order to successfully implement the strategy and safeguard the company's long-term interests  including its sustainability  the company must be able to recruit and retain qualified employees. To do so  the company must be able to offer competitive remuneration. These guidelines enable a competitive remuneration package to be offered to Group Management.Forms of remuneration  etc.The total remuneration shall be on market terms and shall comprise fixed salary  variable cash compensation  pension benefits and other benefits.In addition  members of the Group Management may be offered long-term share-related incentive programmes. Any such programme is decided by the general meeting and is therefore not covered by these guidelines. The Board of Directors evaluates annually whether a share-related incentive programme should be proposed to the General Meeting. Any long-term share-related incentive programme shall have a clear link to the business strategy and be designed with the aim of aligning the interests of the shareholders and the participants for long-term value creation.(i) Fixed salaryThe fixed salary shall be determined on the basis of factors including competence  responsibilities  experience and performance. The Group uses an internationally recognised evaluation system to determine the scope and level of responsibility of executive positions. Comparisons are made with similar companies. Such evaluation is performed annually by the Remuneration Committee and forms the basis for its decisions and the proposed fixed salary for the President that the Committee submits to the Board of Directors for approval.(ii) Variable cash compensationThe variable cash compensation shall not exceed 60 per cent of the fixed salary and shall be linked to predefined  measurable criteria  which may be financial or non-financial. Some of the criteria may consist of quantitative or qualitative goals that are specific to the individual. The criteria shall be designed in such a way as to promote the company's strategy and long-term interests. The Board of Directors shall have the possibility  subject to the limitations that may result from by law or agreement  to demand repayment of variable cash compensation paid on erroneous grounds (claw back).Once the annual accounts have been approved by the Board of Directors  an assessment is made of the extent to which the criteria have been met. The Board of Directors is responsible  following the preparatory work of the Remuneration Committee  for such assessment in respect of variable cash compensation to the President. The President is responsible for the assessment in respect of other executives.(iii) Pension benefitsThe pension benefits for the President and other members of the Group Management shall be defined contribution. The variable cash compensation shall not be included in the basis for calculation of pension. Pension contributions shall not exceed 35 per cent of the fixed annual cash salary. For other members of the Group Management  the defined contribution solution does not include costs for ITP's base plan (Sw. ITPS bottenplatta)  ITPK  part-time pension and supplementary health insurance.(iv) Other benefitsOther benefits may include health insurance and company car benefit. Premiums and other costs related to such benefits may not in total exceed 15 per cent of the fixed annual cash salary.Mandatory legal and collective agreement provisionsNothing in these guidelines shall restrict mandatory legislation or collective agreement provisions  where these are applicable.Termination of employmentA notice period of six months applies to termination of employment by a member of Group Management. On termination of employment by the company  the total remuneration during the notice period and severance compensation  if any  shall not exceed 18 months' fixed salary.Salary and terms of employment for employeesIn the preparation of the Board's proposal for these remuneration guidelines  the salary and terms of employment of the company's employees shall be taken into account by information concerning the total remuneration of employees  the components of the remuneration and the increase and rate of increase in remuneration over time having been part of the decision-making basis for the Remuneration Committee and the Board of Directors in evaluating the reasonableness of the guidelines and the limitations arising from them.The decision-making process for establishing  evaluating and implementing the guidelinesThe Board of Directors has established a Remuneration Committee. The Committee's tasks include preparing the Board's resolution on the proposed guidelines for remuneration to Group Management. The Board of Directors shall draw up proposals for new guidelines at least every four years and submit these proposals for resolution at the Annual General Meeting. The guidelines shall apply until new guidelines are adopted by the General Meeting.The Remuneration Committee submits proposals to the Board of Directors regarding remuneration  etc. to the President. Furthermore  the Remuneration Committee prepares principles for remuneration to the Group Management and approves  on proposal from the President  remuneration  etc. to the Group Management.The Remuneration Committee shall also monitor and evaluate variable compensation schemes for Group Management  the application of remuneration guidelines for Group Management and current remuneration structures and levels of remuneration within the company.The President and other members of Group Management shall not be in attendance during the Board of Directors' consideration and decisions on matters relating to their remuneration.Departure from the guidelinesThe Board of Directors may decide to depart temporarily from the guidelines  in whole or in part  where there are particular reasons for doing so in an individual case and where such departure is necessary in order to safeguard the long-term interests of the company  including its sustainability  or to ensure the company's financial viability.Significant changes to the guidelines and how shareholders' views have been taken into accountThe Board of Director's proposal to the Annual General Meeting 2023 does not entail any significant changes in relation to the guidelines adopted in 2020. However  some adjustments have been made in order to reflect that member of the Group Management can be offered long-term share-related incentive programmes decided by the General Meeting. The design of variable cash remuneration from 2023 is no longer linked to the individual investing in additional shares in the company for part of the variable cash remuneration.At the 2022 Annual General Meeting  no comments were made by shareholders regarding the guidelines. The company has thus not had to consider any comments during the year.Shares and VotesThe company's share capital amounts to SEK 578 914 338 distributed among 273 511 169 shares and votes. The company holds no own shares.Further InformationInformation regarding all the proposed Board members of Boliden AB and the Nomination Committee's motivated statement are available on the company's website www.boliden.com.The annual report and the auditor's report  the auditor's statement on compliance with the guidelines for remuneration  etc. for the Group Management  the auditor's statements in accordance with Chapter 20  Section 8 and Chapter 20  Section 14 of the Swedish Companies Act  the Board's motivated statements in accordance with Chapter 18  Section 4 and Chapter 20  Section 8  Chapter 19  Section 22 and Chapter 20  Section 13 of the Swedish Companies Act  and the Board's remuneration report  are available on www.boliden.com and at the company's head office  Klarabergsviadukten 90 in Stockholm  Sweden  as of Tuesday  April 4  2023.

Volume-weighted average share prices during a period of 20 trading days after Boliden's publication of the year-end report for the financial year 2022 are compared with volume-weighted average share prices during a period of 20 trading days after Boliden's publication of the year-end report for the financial year 2025  with the addition of dividends and other returns. Upon implementation of the Programme  the peer group consists of the following companies: Antofagasta  Aurubis  Lundin Mining  First Quantum  Fresnillo  KGHM  Korea Zinc and TECK.

The Board of Directors proposes that the reduction amount is transferred to the company's non-restricted equity  whereby the share capital is reduced by SEK 1 485 377.34. The 550 508 shares held by Alfa Laval AB  refer to such shares repurchased during the period from March 21  2022  in connection with the publication of the notice to the Annual General Meeting 2022  and the 2022 Annual General Meeting.

The effect of the Board of Directors' proposal regarding increase of the share capital by way of a bonus issue is that the share capital and restricted equity will be increased by SEK 1 485 377.34. Thus  the combined effect is that neither the company's share capital nor the restricted equity is reduced.

In comparison with the current instruction  the proposal includes certain clarifications in relation to the Swedish Corporate Governance Code.According to the Swedish Corporate Governance Code (the Code)  Swedish companies whose shares are traded on a regulated market in Sweden are to have a Nomination Committee.The Nomination Committee shall be composed of representatives of the five largest shareholders in terms of voting rights registered in the shareholders' register maintained by Euroclear Sweden AB as of August 31 the year before the Annual General Meeting1. The Chairman of the Board shall convene the Nomination Committee to its first meeting and shall also be co-opted to the Nomination Committee.

A change in the composition of the Nomination Committee shall immediately be publicly announced.The term of office for the Nomination Committee runs until the next composition of the Nomination Committee has been announced. No remuneration shall be paid out to the members of the Nomination Committee. Any necessary expenses for the work of the Nomination Committee shall be paid by the company.The members of the Nomination Committee are to promote the common interests of all shareholders.

This instruction shall apply until further notice.Item 15 – Resolution on approval of remuneration reportThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to approve the Board of Directors' report on remuneration pursuant to Chapter 8  Section 53 a of the Swedish Companies Act.Item 16 – Resolution regarding authorization to repurchase and transfer Series B shares in the companyThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorizes the Board of Directors to pass a resolution  on one or more occasions for the period up until the next Annual General Meeting  on repurchasing Series B shares in the company in accordance with the following.- The repurchase may as a maximum comprise so many Series B shares that the company after each repurchase holds a maximum of 10 percent of the total number of shares in the company.- The repurchase of Series B shares shall take place on Nasdaq Stockholm.- The repurchase of Series B shares on Nasdaq Stockholm may only occur at a price within the share price interval registered at that time  where share price interval means the difference between the highest buying price and the lowest selling price- Payment of the Series B shares shall be made in cash.Furthermore  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorizes the Board of Directors to pass a resolution  on one or more occasions for the period up until the next Annual General Meeting  on transferring Series B shares in the company in accordance with the following.- The maximum number of Series B shares to be transferred may not exceed the number of shares held by the company at the time of the Board of Directors resolution.- Transfers of Series B shares shall take place:(i) on Nasdaq Stockholm  or(ii) in connection with acquisition of companies or businesses  on market terms.- Transfers of Series B shares on Nasdaq Stockholm may only occur at a price within the share price interval registered at that time  where share price interval means the difference between the highest buying price and the lowest selling price.- The authorization includes the right to resolve on deviation of the preferential rights of shareholders and that payment may be made in other forms than cash.The purpose of the authorizations is to make possible the ability for the Board of Directors to continuously adapt the company's capital structure and thereby contribute to increased shareholder value  to be able to exploit attractive acquisition opportunities by fully or partly financing future acquisitions with the company's own shares  and to ensure the company's undertakings  including social security costs  in accordance with the Board of Directors' proposal for a long-term incentive program under Item 17.The Board of Directors has presented a motivated statement pursuant to Chapter 19  Section 22 of the Swedish Companies Act  the statement is available at the company and on the company's website assaabloy.com/general-meeting.The proposal in this Item 16 requires an approval of shareholders representing at least two-thirds of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the Annual General Meeting to be valid.Item 17 – Resolution regarding long-term incentive programSummary of the programThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to implement a new long-term incentive program for senior executives and key employees within the ASSA ABLOY Group (LTI 2023). LTI 2023 is based on similar principles as LTI 2020  LTI 2021 and LTI 2022.LTI 2023 is proposed to include a maximum of 150 senior executives and key employees within the ASSA ABLOY Group. In order to participate in LTI 2023 the participants will have to hold Series B shares in ASSA ABLOY within the scope of LTI 2023 (saving shares). For every saving share held  the company will grant so called performance awards free-of-charge in accordance with the terms stipulated below.The rationale for the proposalThe purpose of LTI 2023 is to strengthen the ASSA ABLOY Group's ability to retain and recruit competent employees  to contribute to ASSA ABLOY providing a total remuneration that is on market conditions and competitive  and to align the interests of the shareholders with the interests of the employees concerned. Through a share-based long-term incentive program  the employees' remuneration is tied to ASSA ABLOY's future earnings and value growth. In light of the above  the Board of Directors believes that the implementation of LTI 2023 will have a positive effect on the long-term value growth of the Group  including its sustainability  and consequently that LTI 2023 is beneficial to both the shareholders and the company.Personal investment in saving sharesIn order to participate in LTI 2023  the participants will have to hold saving shares. The saving shares can either be Series B shares in ASSA ABLOY that have vested or been used as saving shares under LTI 2020 or previous years' long-term incentive programs  or Series B shares in ASSA ABLOY purchased on the market in connection with the notification to participate in LTI 2023.The personal investment shall amount to a value corresponding to a minimum of 5 percent (all participants) and a maximum of 15 percent (CEO and other senior executives) or 10 percent (other participants)  respectively  of the participant's fixed base salary. If the participant has access to inside information and is therefore prevented from making the personal investment in connection with the application to participate in LTI 2023  the personal investment shall be made as soon as possible  but no later than before the next Annual General Meeting.For employees who have not participated in previous LTI programs  the participation in LTI 2023 is  in addition  subject to renunciation of customary salary review for the year 2023.Participants in LTI 2023 and allocationLTI 2023 is proposed to include a maximum of 150 senior executives and key employees within the ASSA ABLOY Group  divided in three categories.For each saving share that the CEO of the Group holds under LTI 2023  the company will grant six performance awards. For each saving share that other senior executives (currently nine individuals) hold under LTI 2023  each such individual will be awarded five performance awards. For each saving share that other participants (140 individuals) hold under LTI 2023  each such individual will be awarded four performance awards.Performance conditionThe number of performance awards that gives right to receive Series B shares in the company depends on the annual development of ASSA ABLOY's earnings per share2 based on the target levels  as defined by the Board of Directors  during the measurement period 1 January 2023 – 31 December 2025  where each year during the measurement period is compared to the previous year. The outcome is calculated yearly  whereby one third of the performance awards is measured against the outcome for 2023  one third is measured against the outcome for 2024 and one third is measured against the outcome for 2025.The outcome for each year is measured linearly. Unless the minimum level is achieved for the year  none of the relevant performance awards will give right to Series B shares  and if the maximum level is achieved each performance award linked to the relevant year will give right to one Series B share. The Board of Directors intends to present the fulfilment of the performance based condition in the Annual Report for the financial year 2025.Other conditionsIn addition to the above conditions  the following shall apply for the performance awards.- The performance awards shall be granted free-of-charge after the 2023 Annual General Meeting.- Each performance award entitles the holder to receive one Series B share free-of-charge three years after allotment of the award (vesting period)  provided that the holder  with some exceptions  at the time of the release of the interim report for the first quarter 2026 still is employed by the ASSA ABLOY Group and has maintained the saving shares held under LTI 2023.- To make the participants' interest equal with the shareholders'  the company will compensate the participants for distributed dividend during the vesting period by increasing the number of Series B shares that each performance award gives right to after the vesting period.- The performance awards are non-transferable and may not be pledged.- The performance awards can be granted by the company or by any other company within the Group.Preparation and administrationThe Board of Directors shall be responsible for preparing the detailed terms and conditions of LTI 2023  in accordance with the mentioned terms and guidelines. To this end  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to make adjustments to meet foreign regulations or market conditions. The Board of Directors may also make other adjustments if significant changes in the ASSA ABLOY Group  or its operating environment  would result in a situation where the decided terms and conditions for LTI 2023 no longer are appropriate.In the event that the Board of Directors considers that the delivery of Series B shares under LTI 2023 cannot be achieved at reasonable cost  with reasonable administrative efforts or due to specific market conditions  participants may instead be offered a cash settlement.Scope and cost of the programLTI 2023 may  if the share price for the company's Series B share remains the same during the program's term  result in a maximum amount corresponding to 90 percent (CEO)  75 percent (other senior executives) or 40 percent (other participants)  respectively  of the participants annual base salary (excluding social security costs). Such outcome is subject to a maximum personal investment  meaning that the participant must hold saving shares at a value that corresponds to 15 percent (CEO and other senior executives) or 10 percent (other participants)  respectively  of the participants annual base salary and that the performance based condition has been fully achieved. Full vesting is further subject to the saving shares being retained and that the participant  with some exceptions  is still employed during the vesting period.The total number of saving shares  which corresponds to the participant's total maximum personal investment  and thus the total number of performance awards being allotted  depends on the share price for the company's Series B share at the time of allotment of performance awards under LTI 2023. The total number of outstanding shares in the company amounts to 1 112 576 334 shares.Provided that the share price for the company's Series B share is traded at around SEK 246 at the time of allotment of performance awards under LTI 2023  LTI 2023 will  in accordance with the principles and assumptions set out above  comprise a maximum of 750 000 Series B shares in total  which corresponds to approximately 0.1 percent of the total outstanding shares and votes in the company.LTI 2023 shall be expensed as personnel costs over the vesting period. Provided that the performance based condition is fully achieved  the cost for LTI 2023 before tax is  in accordance with the principles and assumptions set out above  estimated to approximately SEK 170 million  allocated over the vesting period. Estimated social security costs and financing cost are included in such amount.The costs are expected to have marginal effect on key ratios of the ASSA ABLOY Group.The Board of Directors deems that the positive effects on earnings that are expected to result from increased share ownership among senior executives and persons in senior managerial positions  which may be further increased through LTI 2023  outweigh the costs related to LTI 2023.Delivery of shares under LTI 2023To ensure the delivery of Series B shares under LTI 2023  the company intends to enter into an agreement with a third party  under which the third party shall  in its own name  buy and transfer Series B shares in the company to the participants in accordance with LTI 2023.Preparation of the proposalLTI 2023 has been initiated by the Board of Directors of ASSA ABLOY  and has been structured in consultation with external advisers based on an evaluation of previous incentive programs. LTI 2023 has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee and reviewed at meetings of the Board of Directors.Previous incentive programsThe company's other share-based incentive programs LTI 2020  LTI 2021 and LTI 2022 are based on the similar principles as LTI 2023. For a description of LTI 2020  LTI 2021 and LTI 2022  reference is made to the Annual Report 2022  Note 35  and the company's website www.assaabloy.com.Shares and votesThe total number of shares in the company at the time for the notice to the Annual General Meeting amount to 1 112 576 334 shares  of which 57 525 969 are Series A shares and 1 055 050 365 Series B shares  which is equivalent to a total of 1 630 310 055 votes. ASSA ABLOY AB is holding at the time of the notice to the Annual General Meeting  1 800 000 own Series B shares  corresponding to 1 800 000 votes that may not be represented at the Annual General Meeting.Shareholders´ right to right to request informationThe Board of Directors and the CEO shall  if any shareholder so requests and the Board of Directors believes that it can be done without material harm to the company  at the Annual General Meeting provide information regarding circumstances that may affect the assessment of an item on the agenda and circumstances that can affect the assessment of the company's or its subsidiaries' financial situation and the company's relation to other companies within the Group and the Group accounts.Documentation etc.The Annual Report and the Auditor's Report  the Board of Directors' remuneration report and all other supporting documentation for the Annual General Meeting are available at the company and on the company's website assaabloy.com/general-meeting no later than three weeks before the Annual General Meeting.

The principles are forward-looking  i.e. they are applicable to remuneration agreed  and amendments to remuneration already agreed  after adoption of the principles by the 2023 Annual General Meeting. These principles do not apply to any remuneration decided on or approved by the Annual General Meeting.Trelleborg is a world leader in engineered polymer solutions that seal  damp and protect critical applications in demanding environments. Trelleborg’s strategy of securing leading positions in selected industries is supported by four strategic cornerstones: Geographic balance  Portfolio optimization  Structural improvements and Excellence. These ensure that all levels within the Group maintain focus and conduct activities that are in line with the strategy. For more information regarding Trelleborg’s business strategy  please see the section of Group’s strategy at www.trelleborg.com.A prerequisite for the successful implementation of Trelleborg’s business strategy and safeguarding of its long-term interests  including its sustainability strategy  is that Trelleborg is able to recruit  develop and retain qualified senior executives. To this end  it is necessary that Trelleborg offers market-aligned and competitive remuneration. These principles enable Trelleborg to offer senior executives competitive total remuneration. The aim of all variable remuneration covered by these principles is to promote Trelleborg’s business strategy and long-term interests  including its sustainability profile.Types of remunerationRemuneration is to be on market terms and may consist of the following components: fixed salary  variable remuneration  pension benefits and other benefits. Additionally  the Annual General Meeting may – irrespective of these principles – resolve on  among other items  share-based or share-price-based remuneration.The satisfaction of criteria for awarding variable remuneration is to be measured over a period of one year (short-term incentive program) or several years (long-term incentive programs). The following applies for senior executives  including the President and CEO:- the short-term incentive program may amount to not more than 100 percent of the fixed salary during the measurement period.- the long-term incentive programs may amount to not more than 100 percent of the fixed salary during the measurement period.Further variable remuneration may be awarded in extraordinary circumstances  provided that such extraordinary arrangements are limited in time and only made on an individual basis  either for the purpose of recruiting or retaining senior executives  or as remuneration for extraordinary performance beyond the individual’s ordinary tasks. Such remuneration may not exceed an amount corresponding to 100 percent of the fixed salary and may not be paid more than once each year per individual. Any resolution on such remuneration for the President and CEO shall be made by the Board based on a proposal from the Remuneration Committee. Any resolution on such remuneration for other senior executives shall be made by the Remuneration Committee based on a proposal from the President and CEO.Variable remuneration will only qualify for pension benefits to the extent required by mandatory collective agreement provisions or otherwise stated by local law.For the President and CEO pension benefits  including health insurance  are to be defined contribution. Variable remuneration does not qualify for pension benefits. The pension premiums for defined contribution pension are to amount to not more than 45 percent of the fixed salary. For other senior executives  pension benefits  including health insurance  are to be defined contribution unless the individual concerned is subject to defined benefit pension under mandatory collective agreement provisions or otherwise stated by local law. The pension premiums for defined contribution pension are to amount to not more than 35 percent of the fixed salary.Other benefits may include  for example  life insurance  medical insurance and company cars. Premiums and other costs relating to such benefits may amount to not more than 15 percent of the fixed salary.For employment contracts governed by legislation outside of Sweden  pension benefits and other benefits may be duly adjusted for compliance with mandatory rules or established local practice  taking into account  to the extent possible  the overall purpose of these principles.Trelleborg does not have any long-term share-based incentive plans. Such plans must be resolved by the Annual General Meeting and are therefore excluded from these principles.Criteria for awarding variable cash remunerationThe variable remuneration is to be linked to predetermined and measurable criteria of a financial or non-financial nature. They may also be individualized  quantitative or qualitative objectives. The criteria are to be designed so that they contribute to Trelleborg’s business strategy and long-term interests  including its sustainability strategy by  for example  being clearly linked to the business results or promoting the senior executive’s long-term development.The extent to which the criteria for awarding variable remuneration have been fulfilled is to be evaluated/ determined when the measurement period has ended. The Remuneration Committee is responsible for evaluating variable remuneration to the President and CEO  subsequently to be approved by the Board of Directors. For variable remuneration to other senior executives  the President and CEO is responsible for the evaluation  subsequently to be approved by the Remuneration Committee  in accordance with the grandparent principle. For financial objectives  the evaluation is to be based on the latest financial information published by the Trelleborg Group.Right to withhold or reclaim remunerationTerms and conditions for variable remuneration are to be designed so that the Board of Directors (i) has the right to limit or refrain from payment of variable remuneration if exceptional economic circumstances occur and if such a measure is considered reasonable  and (ii) has the right to withhold or reclaim variable remuneration paid to an executive based on results that afterwards were found to have been misstated because of wrongdoing or malpractice (so called malus and claw back).The Board of Directors may  at its discretion  limit or refrain from payment of the individual variable salary if a senior executive  including the President and CEO  has breached or neglected Trelleborg’s Code of Conduct and/or Trelleborg’s sustainability commitments as a responsible corporate citizen  including environmental  social and governance factors.Termination of employmentIf employment of a senior executive is terminated by the company  the contractual notice period will not exceed 24 months. During the notice period all employment conditions will apply  unless otherwise expressly agreed between the company and the employee. No additional severance payments will be made to the employee. When a senior executive terminates their employment  the contractual notice period will not exceed six months  and there is no right to any severance pay.Salary and employment conditions for employeesIn the preparation of the Board of Directors’ proposal for these remuneration principles  current salary and employment conditions for employees of Trelleborg have been taken into account. Information on the employees’ total income  the components of the remuneration  and its increase and growth rate over time  have been evaluated. Thereafter  the Remuneration Committee and the Board of Directors decide whether the principles and the limitations set out herein are reasonable.Decision-making process to determine  review and implement the principlesThe Board of Directors has established a Remuneration Committee. The Committee’s tasks include preparing the Board of Directors’ decision to propose remuneration principles for Group Management. The Board of Directors is to prepare a proposal for new principles at least every fourth year and submit such proposal to the Annual General Meeting. The principles shall apply until new principles are adopted by the Annual General Meeting. The Remuneration Committee is also to monitor and evaluate programs for variable remuneration for senior executives  the application of the principles for senior executive remuneration as well as the current remuneration structures and levels in Trelleborg. The members of the Remuneration Committee are independent from Trelleborg and its senior executives. The President and CEO including other members of senior executives do not participate in the Board of Directors’ processing of and resolutions regarding remuneration-related matters in so far as they are affected by the same.Derogation from the principlesThe Board of Directors may temporarily resolve to derogate from the principles  in whole or in part  if in a specific case there is special cause for the derogation and a derogation is necessary to serve Trelleborg’s long-term interests  including its sustainability strategy  or to ensure Trelleborg’s financial viability. As set out above  the Remuneration Committee’s tasks include preparing the Board of Directors’ resolution in remuneration-related matters. This includes any resolution to derogate from the principles.Shareholder’s viewsThe Board of Directors has not received any views from the shareholders on the principles of remuneration for senior executives.Description of significant changes compared to previous principles of remuneration for senior executivesUnder the section Types of remuneration  the following changes are proposed.Previously  the definition of annual maximum outcome for the long-term incentive program was linked to the annual maximum outcome of the short-term incentive program. The proposal is to link the annual maximum outcome in the long-term incentive program to the fixed salary from 2023. This means that the structure can be independently defined for both the short- and the long-term incentive program. This change itself doesn’t have any impact on the size of the long-term incentive program entitlement (neither higher or lower).For attraction and performance purposes in extraordinary circumstances the following new amendment have been proposed:Further variable remuneration may be awarded in extraordinary circumstances  provided that such extraordinary arrangements are limited in time and only made on an individual basis  either for the purpose of recruiting or retaining senior executives  or as remuneration for extraordinary performance beyond the individual’s ordinary tasks. Such remuneration may not exceed an amount corresponding to 100 percent of the fixed salary and may not be paid more than once each year per individual. Any resolution on such remuneration for the President and CEO shall be made by the Board based on a proposal from the Remuneration Committee. Any resolution on such remuneration for other senior executives shall be made by the Remuneration Committee based on a proposal from the President and CEO.17 – RESOLUTION ON AUTHORIZATION FOR THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO RESOLVE ON REPURCHASE OF OWN SHARESThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to authorize the Board of Directors to resolve on acquisition of own class B shares  on the following terms and conditions:(i) acquisition may take place on Nasdaq Stockholm  on one or more occasions prior to the next Annual General Meeting;(ii) acquisition may be made of such amount of shares of class B that the Company’s holding of own shares does not at any time exceed one tenth of the total number of shares in the Company  provided that  based on the most recently adopted balance sheet  there is sufficient unrestricted equity;(iii) acquisition may be made at a price which falls within the prevailing price interval registered at each point in time (i.e. in the interval between the highest purchase price and the lowest selling price); and(iv) payment of acquired shares shall be made in cash.The purpose of the proposed authorization  is to enable the Board of Directors to start adapt the Company’s capital structure and thereby contribute to increased shareholder value. The intent is that the repurchased shares later will be cancelled by resolutions of upcoming Annual General Meetings.The Board of Directors shall be entitled to resolve on other terms and conditions for the repurchase of own shares. The Chairman of the Board of Directors  or the person appointed by the Chairman of the Board of Directors  is authorized to make such minor adjustments in the above proposal that may prove to be necessary in connection with execution of the Board of Directors’ resolution on repurchase of own shares.In order to be valid  a resolution regarding authorization of the Board of Directors to acquire own shares of class B requires approval of at least two thirds of the votes cast and the shares represented at the meeting.18 – RESOLUTIONS ON (A) REDUCTION OF THE SHARE CAPITAL BY MEANS OF CANCELLATION OF REPURCHASED SHARES AND (B) INCREASE OF THE SHARE CAPITAL THROUGH A BONUS ISSUE WITHOUT ISSUE OF NEW SHARESA. Reduction of share capital by cancellation of own sharesThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to reduce the share capital by way of cancellation of own shares. The purpose of the reduction is allocation to unrestricted equity.The reduction of the share capital shall be made by cancellation of 15 945 864 own shares of series B that are held by the company. The reduction of the share capital will be SEK 154 143 352 by way of cancellation of 15 945 864 shares of series B.The resolution to reduce the share capital under this item (A) may be executed without a permit from the Swedish Companies Registration Office or  in the event of a dispute  a general court  as the company simultaneously carries out a bonus issue  as set out under item (B) below  with an amount corresponding to no less than the amount the share capital is being reduced with  as set out above. Combined  these measures entail that neither the company’s restricted equity nor its share capital is reduced.B. Bonus issueWith the purpose of restoring the share capital after the proposed reduction of the share capital  as set out under item (A) above  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting simultaneously resolves on a bonus issue to increase the company’s share capital by SEK 154 143 352 through a transfer of SEK 154 143 352 from the company’s unrestricted equity. The bonus issue shall be carried out without issue of new shares.Statement by the Board of Directors pursuant to Chapter 20  Section 13  fourth paragraph of the Swedish Companies ActIn view of the Board of Directors’ proposal for resolution on reduction of the share capital through cancellation of shares  the Board of Directors hereby issues the following statement pursuant to Chapter 20  Section 13  fourth paragraph of the Swedish Companies Act.It follows from the proposal on reduction of the share capital that the Board proposes that the company’s share capital shall be reduced by SEK 154 143 352 through cancellation of 15 945 864 shares of series B for allocation to unrestricted equity.In order to achieve a time-efficient cancellation procedure without the requirement of obtaining the Swedish Companies Registration Office’s or a general court’s permission  the Board has also proposed that the Annual General Meeting resolves on restoring the company’s share capital to its current amount by increasing the share capital with SEK 154 143 352 by way of a bonus issue without issuance of new shares. The amount is to be transferred from the company’s unrestricted equity to the company’s share capital.Through the reduction of the share capital due to the cancellation of shares  the company’s share capital is reduced by SEK 154 143 352 and through the bonus issue the company’s share capital is increased by the same amount. The company’s restricted equity and share capital will therefore remain unchanged after the implementation of the bonus issue.Following completion of the reduction of the share capital and the bonus issue  the number of shares will be 255 125 919  of which 28 500 000 are shares of series A and 226 625 919 are shares of series B.The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorize the Board of Directors  or the person appointed by the Board  to make such minor adjustments to the resolutions according to item (A) and (B) above as may be required for registration of the resolutions with the Swedish Companies Registration Office or Euroclear Sweden AB and to take such other measures required to execute the resolutions.The resolutions under items (A) and (B) are conditional upon each other. In order for the resolutions by the General Meeting in accordance with the Board of Directors’ proposals above to be valid  the resolutions must be accepted by shareholders holding no less than two thirds of the votes cast as well as the shares represented at the General Meeting.ANNUAL REPORT AND OTHER DOCUMENTATION PROVIDEDThe Nomination Committee’s reasoned statement  the power of attorney form and postal voting form will be available from the company’s head office  Johan Kocksgatan 10  231 45 Trelleborg  Sweden and on the company’s website www.trelleborg.com.

The war in Ukraine  very European from an economic point of view  created major international de-correlations across markets  initially leaving the European continent struggling alone. Ultimately  global inflation tensions  even beyond energy  drove global indices significantly down. Volatility  the main market parameter favorable to the group's activities  was sustainably above its historical average in 2022. Nonetheless  the M&A market suffered  coherently  from this global situation as the main global indices fell by nearly 20%.Business Performance - In 2022  ABC arbitrage has closed its strategic plan ABC 2022 for the years 2020  2021 and 2022. The group had defined quantitative and qualitative objectives  most of which were achieved 2 ..➢ With €92m  the cumulative net income over the 3 years exceeds the stated objectives  with annual ROE significantly above the threshold of 15%  the level of out-performance defined by the group.➢ The dividend policy has been confirmed with a cumulative distribution of €1.29 and a share of added value at more than 40% for the group’s employees.➢ An evolution of the governance and a new RH policy have been achieved with success.➢ Target assets under management (“AUM”)  in contrast  has not been achieved  with client assets standing at €372m as at March 1st 2023Dividend Policy - A quarterly distribution policy has been in place for over two years.➢ Distribution of €0.10 per share in October 2022;➢ Distribution of €0.10 per share in December 2022;➢ Interim dividend of €0.10 per share on April 18  2023 for payment on April 20;➢ Proposition at the General Meeting of June 9  2023 of a final dividend of €0.11 per share. The total distribution for fiscal year 2022 will amount to €0.41 per share  i.e. a payout ratio of more than 83%.Story continuesRetained earnings will be invested in the development of new products with significant performance prospects. The terms and timetable of this final dividend will be presented at a later date.Outlook - The group presents its new strategic plan Springboard 2025 for the 3 years to come. This plan has been built based on the conclusions of the plan ABC 2022 and the the long term needs of the group:➢ To generate cumulative net income over 3 years of more than €100m with an annual ROE above 15%.➢ To maintain a payout ratio of approximately 80%  implying a potential cumulative distribution of more than €1.3 per share over the three years.➢ To develop investment management capacity to facilitate accommodating 1 billion euros of AUM  with €800m from external clients of the group with a profitability above 2% on those external assets.➢ To continue with the necessary hires for the group's ambitions  reaching almost 140 employees in 2025 (+33% compared to 2022).➢ To continue significant IT investment  in service the group’s trading strategies.➢ To continue evolving the group’s organizational and governance structure to serve productivity.The first quarter of 2023 saw markets rise significantly  despite the geopolitical and economical context  until the bankruptcies of Silvergate and Silicon Valley Bank during the week of March 6th. Even if it’s too early to define all the forward looking scenarios around these bankruptcies  the group's rhythm of activity for the first quarter 2023  as in 2022  is below that of 2021 due to the low volatility of the first weeks. The group continues to develop its know-how to extract the best possible performances from the current situations  in particular with the significant increase of current volatility.1 At this date  the audit procedures carried out by the statutory auditors are still in progress.2 The details of the ABC 2022 plan and the Springboard 2025 plan will be available on March 21st 2023  at 11:30 AM on the ABC arbitrage group websiteontacts : abc-arbitrage.comRelations actionnaires : actionnaires@abc-arbitrage.comRelations presse: VERBATEE / v.sabineu@verbatee.com EURONEXT Paris - Compartiment BISIN : FR0004040608Reuters BITI.PA / Bloomberg ABCA FPAttachment,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.25,0.09,0.66,True,English,"['ABC arbitrage', 'Results', 'Bloomberg ABCA FP Attachment', 'new strategic plan Springboard', 'ABC arbitrage group website', 'Chairman Dominique Ceolin', 'major international de-correlations', 'main market parameter', 'M&A market', 'long term needs', 'Silicon Valley Bank', 'best possible performances', 'significant IT investment', 'consolidated financial statements', 'global inflation tensions', 'new RH policy', 'significant performance prospects', 'main global indices', 'investment management capacity', 'cumulative net income', 'potential cumulative distribution', 'quarterly distribution policy', 'new products', 'Springboard 2025 plan', 'significant increase', 'Net revenues', 'global situation', 'Business Performance', 'Dividend Policy', 'fiscal year', 'complex year', 'economic point', 'European continent', 'historical average', 'Target assets', 'client assets', 'Interim dividend', 'General Meeting', 'final dividend', 'total distribution', 'payout ratio', '1 billion euros', 'external clients', 'external assets', 'necessary hires', 'trading strategies', 'first quarter', 'economical context', 'first weeks', 'current situations', 'audit procedures', 'statutory auditors', 'Relations presse', 'EURONEXT Paris', 'Compartiment B', 'Reuters BITI', 'ABC 2022 plan', 'financial markets', 'low volatility', 'current volatility', 'qualitative objectives', 'annual ROE', 'Retained earnings', 'later date', 'governance structure', 'Relations actionnaires', 'two years', 'three years', 'March 1st', '3 years', '2022 Results', '2022 Distributions', 'Directors', 'millions', 'IFRS', 'share', 'Return', 'Equity', 'world', 'war', 'Ukraine', 'view', 'energy', 'activities', 'quantitative', 'threshold', 'level', 'out-performance', 'value', 'employees', 'evolution', 'success', 'AUM', 'contrast', 'place', 'October', 'December', 'April', 'payment', 'Proposition', 'June', 'Story', 'development', 'terms', 'timetable', 'Outlook', 'conclusions', 'profitability', 'ambitions', 'service', 'organizational', 'productivity', 'geopolitical', 'bankruptcies', 'Silvergate', 'scenarios', 'rhythm', 'activity', 'know-how', 'progress', 'details', '11:30 AM', 'ontacts', 'VERBATEE', 'ISIN', 'FR0004040608', '➢']",2023-03-21,2023-03-22,finance.yahoo.com

Crossject is a human-sized company working out of two sites (Dijon and Gray) and covering a wide range of activities  from the design/development of medicines to the preparation of their marketing and their manufacture.After 20 years of research and development  Crossject has achieved major clinical  industrial and commercial milestones in the last two years  laying solid foundations for its future.Emergency situationsCrossject specialises in pre-hospital emergencies. Patients diagnosed at risk of life-threatening seizures can get a prescription for their emergency dose from their doctor  fill the prescription in a pharmacy and then carry it with them at all times.Story continuesPeople are generally not in a medical environment when they have seizures  so they either have to inject the emergency dose themselves or have it done by a member of their family  who is not a health professional. That is where our ZENEO® needle-free injector comes in. ZENEO® is pre-filled and single-use  very easy to understand and extremely safe to use. The ergonomics of our system owe much to cooperation with patient associations for several indications  and has been validated by more than 1 000 people in total on countless occasions. In most cases  an injection can be performed in under a minute  even in stressful situations or by someone unfamiliar with ZENEO®. In the latest “human factors” study in the United States ( see press release of 12 September 2022 )  an exceptional proportion of 99.6% of people successfully completed the injection.In addition  thanks to its ability to inject the dose in less than a tenth of a second (compared with several seconds for most conventional systems)  ZENEO® eliminates most of the risks of misuse.Efficacy of ZENEO®ZENEO® has a long history of proven efficacy and flexibility  with more than 10 clinical studies under its belt  including a 2014 bioequivalence study in combination with subcutaneous methotrexate.However  in most emergency situations  such as epilepsy or allergic shock  it is preferable to administer the drug by intramuscular injection  potentially through clothing. ZENEO® has recently demonstrated its ability to perform such injections (see our press release of 2 November 2022 announcing the positive readout of the ZENEO® Midazolam clinical study  developed for epileptic seizures). This makes Crossject the only company worldwide to offer a means of intramuscular injection (on bare skin or through clothing) in a fraction of a second.Crossject  developer of therapeutic solutionsCrossject is a developer of therapeutic solutions  working both on the ZENEO® medical device and on the combination of ZENEO® with a drug adapted to each therapeutic indication.As a company with ISO 13485 certification for the design  development  production and manufacture of a sterile single-use auto-injector (see our press release of 15 August 2022) and as a pharmaceutical company (see our press release of 16 November 2021)  Crossject is ideally positioned to develop innovative solutions.Marketing authorisation applications for the three priority indications (epilepsy  acute adrenal insufficiency  allergic shock) are scheduled to be submitted in 2024. However  the goal is still to file an Emergency Use Authorization application under the BARDA contract in 2023 (see below).It is important to note that Crossject used advanced reliability quantification techniques to develop ZENEO® in order to meet the FDA’s very demanding standards (at least 99.999% compliant injections  which is equivalent to less than ten mechanical failures per million injections).Crossject  manufacturerCrossject has a three-stage industrial chain for the manufacture of its medical devices. Upstream  the company subcontracts the manufacture of components to partners with the necessary expertise in plastic or metal injection  glass forming  elastomer moulding  etc. Crossject generally owns the specific tools  which are integrated into the partner’s industrial facilities.Downstream  Crossject sources its active ingredients from specialised chemical manufacturers and delivers them to a manufacturer specialised in the mixing and filling of sterile injectable liquid products (fill/finish). Crossject also supplies the manufacturer with a ready-to-fill kit consisting of two sub-assemblies: a sterile pharmaceutical sub-assembly  intended to receive the drug  prepared and shipped from Crossject’s Dijon site  and an actuator (the injector’s mechanical part)  assembled and shipped from Crossject’s Gray site.Crossject already has highly efficient industrial facilities; each piece of equipment has its own capacity  so the maximum capacity of the whole is determined by the slowest workstation; Crossject accordingly has production capacity of more than 500 000 ready-to-fill kits per year – capacity that is about to increase with the ongoing installation of new equipment recently delivered with the support of France Relance (press release of 10 March 2021).Crossject’s medium-term strategy is to grow its industrial capacity by removing bottlenecks as business needs change. The renovation of a 1000 sq.m. building on the Gray site (delivery scheduled before this summer) will allow Crossject to lift its capacity to more than 6 million units per year.MarketingCrossject initially chose to entrust the distribution of its products to pharmaceutical companies already established in the relevant geographies and therapeutic indications.The priority geographies are North America and Western Europe.Of the seven therapeutic indications in its portfolio  two are already covered by licensing agreements  namely acute adrenal insufficiency for North America (press release of 16 June 2021) and epilepsy for Germany (press release of 18 June 2019)  for which several milestones have been successfully achieved.A new indication could also be developed in partnership with an American laboratory (press release of 15 September 2022).Crossject’s epilepsy product is also the subject of a contract with BARDA (the US government agency that supports the research  development and manufacture of medical products for public health emergencies) (press release of 18 June 2022  contract no. 75A50122C00031). The total value of the contract – if all options are exercised – is $155 million and includes advanced regulatory development in the United States and the supply of products to the US Strategic National Stockpile  upon approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The aim is to start deliveries by the end of 2023  subject to obtaining Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA) from the Food Drug Administration (FDA).Crossject  a committed companyIn recent years  Crossject has demonstrated its commitment on CSR questions  with a gender equality index reading above 90 for two consecutive years and a significant increase in its GAIA index from 15 to 60 in just three years. The company has also received a Responsible Care® award  demonstrating its commitment to transforming itself into a major player in the field of life-saving emergency medicines.Financial information as of 31 December 2022In line with the business plan  the strengthening of our financial base to support the very substantial acceleration of our development was a real success in 2022. The €22 million financial reinforcement came from several sources;BARDA invoicing: $1.8 million invoiced in 2022Free allocation of equity warrants to all shareholders: €2.8 millionCapital increase with preferential subscription rights: €4.09 millionExercise of warrants: €0.2 millionNew borrowings: at the end of the year we completed a major non-dilutive financial transaction of €14 million  with €4 million in loans granted in 2022. The transaction includes various loans granted by long-standing banks (Caisse d’Epargne and BNP)  Société Générale and BPI  with amortisation periods ranging from 5 to 10 years  and nearly 85% of the total available immediately.All OC1223 convertible bonds were converted during the year and 95.7% of the OC1224 convertible bonds were converted during the year  the balance being converted this day.In the year ended 31 December 2022  we recorded a very substantial increase in operating income to €9.7 million  an increase of 43%.It includes €0.95 million in revenue relating to milestones achieved during the year.€ thousand  as of 31 December 2022 2021 Operating income 9 718 6 772 Operating expenses -23 005 -18 594 Purchases of raw materials and supplies -498 -954 Other purchases and external expenses -8 116 -5 901 Personnel expenses -7 424 -6 183 Taxes and duties -176 -202 Depreciation  amortisation and provisions -6 358 -5 013 Other expenses -433 -342 Operating profit/(loss) -13 288 -11 823 Financial income/(expense) -319 -774 Exceptional income/(expense) 228 81 Corporate tax 2 222 1 818 Net profit/(loss) -11 157 -10 698 The financial statements for the six months to 31 December 2022 were approved by the members of the Management Board on 20 March 2023 and presented at the Supervisory Board meeting of 20 March 2023. They have been audited.In addition  capitalised production increased by 13% to €6.1 million as a result of ongoing research and development activities.During the year  Crossject maintained its focus on cost control. Operating expenses increased by just 24%  a very moderate rise in relation to that of operating income.Other purchases and external expenses amounted to €8.1 million  compared with €5.9 million in 2021  attributable notably to the progress of production work linked to the BARDA contract  the completion of various clinical studies and batches on several drugs in the portfolio and the costs inherent to the industrial ramp-up in the broad sense.At the end of 2022  Crossject had approximately 100 employees  a slight increase compared with the end of 2021. Personnel expenses amounted to €7.4 million in 2022  compared with €6.2 million in 2021  taking into account recruitments in 2022 aimed at obtaining more qualified skills better suited to our stage of development.The overall operating loss was €13.3 million  compared with a loss of €11.8 million in 2021.The Group recorded net financial expense of 0.3 million for 2022  compared with an expense of €0.9 million for 2021.After taking into account exceptional income of €0.2 million and a Research Tax Credit of €2.2 million  an increase of €0.4 million on 2021  the net loss for 2022 was €11.2 million.As of 31 December 2022  Crossject had cash of €8 million (€10 million at the end of 2021)  plus €6.2 million in non-dilutive financing announced at the end of the year and €3.8 million from the same plan  yet to be received  of which €2.0 million is conditional on obtaining Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA) from the Food Drug Administration (FDA).In view of current contracts (and in particular monthly invoicing to BARDA) and the very clear visibility Crossject has acquired in recent months  the company is confident in its ability to find the necessary financing to continue its development.Contacts:CrossjectPatrick Alexandreinfo@crossject.com Investor relationsAELIUMJérôme Gacoin +33 (0) 1 75 77 54 67crossject@aelium.frPress relationsBuzz & CompagnieMélanie Voisard +33 (0)6 12 52 53 15melanie.voisard@buzzetcompagnie.comChristelle Distinguin +33 (0)6 09 96 51 70christelle.distinguin@buzzetcompagnie.comAbout CROSSJECT • www.crossject.comCrossject (ISIN: FR0011716265; Ticker: ALCJ; LEI: 969500W1VTFNL2D85A65) is developing and is soon to market a portfolio of drugs dedicated to emergency situations: epilepsy  overdose  allergic shock  severe migraine and asthma attack.

21006,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/press-release-dupixent-dupilumab-approved-060000183.html,Press Release: Dupixent® (dupilumab) approved by European Commission as first and only targeted medicine for children as young as six months old with severe atopic dermatitis,Dupixent® (dupilumab) approved by European Commission as first and only targeted medicine for children as young as six months old with severe atopic...,Sanofi - Aventis GroupeDupixent® (dupilumab) approved by European Commission as first and only targeted medicine for children as young as six months old with severe atopic dermatitisApproximately seven times as many patients aged 6 months to 5 years with severe atopic dermatitis treated with Dupixent experienced clear or almost clear skin and reduced overall disease severity compared to placeboPatients treated with Dupixent achieved rapid itch reduction as early as three weeks after start of therapy  with significant improvements at 16 weeks sustained through one yearDupixent is now a treatment option for the approximately 80 000 infants and young children living with uncontrolled severe atopic dermatitis in EuropeMilestone marks third Dupixent European Commission approval in the past four monthsParis and Tarrytown  N.Y. March 21  2023. The European Commission (EC) has approved Dupixent® (dupilumab) in the European Union (EU) to treat severe atopic dermatitis in children aged 6 months to 5 years old who are candidates for systemic therapy. With this approval  Dupixent is the first and only targeted medicine indicated to treat these young children in Europe and the U.S.Korey Capozza  MPHFounder and Executive Director of Global Parents for Eczema Research (GPER)“Watching an infant or young child grapple with the debilitating and wide-reaching impacts of severe atopic dermatitis is heartbreaking. I’ve personally witnessed how this chronic skin disease can disrupt the lives of entire families when left uncontrolled. Intervening with effective treatments during infancy and early childhood can help manage the challenging impact this disease has on children and their families during such formative years.”Atopic dermatitis is a chronic type 2 inflammatory skin disease. Between 85% and 90% of patients first develop symptoms before 5 years of age  which can often continue through adulthood. Symptoms include intense  persistent itch and skin lesions that cover much of the body  resulting in skin dryness  cracking  pain  redness or darkening  crusting and oozing  which can increase the risk of skin infection. Severe atopic dermatitis may also significantly impact the quality of life of young children and their caregivers. Treatment options in this age group are primarily topical corticosteroids (TCS)  which can be associated with safety risks and may impair growth when used long-term.Story continuesNaimish Patel  M.D.Head of Global Development  Immunology and Inflammation at Sanofi“A vast majority of people with atopic dermatitis begin to develop symptoms during their earliest  most vulnerable years  and these symptoms can often continue through the rest of their lives. With this latest approval  Dupixent is the first-ever biologic medicine for people living with atopic dermatitis from infancy to adulthood. Given its well-established safety and efficacy profile  Dupixent has the potential to transform the landscape for people of all ages living with atopic dermatitis. We remain committed to exploring Dupixent for the treatment of other chronic inflammatory skin diseases.”George D. Yancopoulos  M.D.  Ph.D.President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron“No infant or child should have to spend their earliest days suffering with the intense and unrelenting itch and skin pain of atopic dermatitis. Too often the parents and caregivers of children with severe atopic dermatitis are left desperate for new treatments to manage this chronic disease. In the pivotal trial  Dupixent reduced itch and skin pain  and improved health-related quality of life and sleep quality. Dupixent is currently being used to treat more than 600 000 patients around the word across approved indications. This latest EU approval brings the proven efficacy  and importantly  the long-term safety profile of Dupixent to this particularly vulnerable population.”The approval is based on data from a Phase 3 trial evaluating Dupixent every four weeks (200 mg or 300 mg based on body weight) plus low-potency TCS or TCS alone (placebo) in 162 children aged 6 months to 5 years with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. At 16 weeks  Dupixent improved skin clearance and reduced overall disease severity and itch compared to placebo in the overall enrolled population. In a subset of those with severe atopic dermatitis  patients randomized to Dupixent (n=63) experienced the following compared to placebo (n=62) at 16 weeks:46% of patients achieved 75% or greater improvement in overall disease severity compared to 7% treated with placebo  a co-primary endpoint.14% of patients achieved clear or almost clear skin compared to 2% treated with placebo  a co-primary endpoint.55% average reduction in overall disease severity from baseline compared to 10% with placebo.42% average reduction in itch from baseline compared to a 1% increase with placebo.Dupixent also improved sleep quality  skin pain and health-related quality of life compared to placebo in both the overall and severe populations. Long-term efficacy data showed the clinical benefit at 16 weeks was sustained through 52 weeks.The most common side effects across indications include injection site reactions  conjunctivitis  conjunctivitis allergic  arthralgia  oral herpes and eosinophilia. The safety results of the 6 months to 5 years old trial were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications; in the trial  adverse events more commonly observed (≥5%) with Dupixent compared to placebo included eosinophilia and conjunctivitis. The long-term safety profile through 52 weeks was similar to the safety profile observed at 16 weeks  and consistent with what was observed in older patients with atopic dermatitis.About the Pivotal Dupixent Atopic Dermatitis TrialThe Phase 3 randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent added to standard-of-care low-potency TCS compared to low-potency TCS alone (placebo) in 162 children aged 6 months to 5 years with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis.The co-primary endpoints assessed the proportion of patients achieving an Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) and 75% improvement in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI-75) at week 16. Additional endpoints measured itch (assessed by a caregiver-reported worst scratch/itch numerical rating scale from 0-10)  sleep quality (assessed by a caregiver-reported numerical rating scale from 0-10)  skin pain (assessed by a caregiver-reported numerical rating scale from 0-10) and health-related quality of life (assessed by the Children’s Dermatology Life Quality Index in patients aged 4 to 5 years and the Infants’ Dermatitis Quality of Life Index in patients aged 6 months to 3 years  both scales from 0-30).About DupixentDupixent is an injection administered under the skin (subcutaneous injection) at different injection sites. In patients aged 6 months to 5 years  Dupixent is administered with a pre-filled syringe every four weeks based on weight (200 mg for children ≥5 to <15 kg and 300 mg for children ≥15 to <30 kg). Dupixent is intended for use under the guidance of a healthcare professional and can be given in a clinic or at home by self-administration after training by a healthcare professional. In children younger than 12 years of age  Dupixent should be administered by a caregiver if given at home. Dupixent does not require initial lab testing or ongoing lab monitoring.Dupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent  such as atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) and prurigo nodularis.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP  EoE or prurigo nodularis in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in Europe  the U.S. and Japan. More than 600 000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including pediatric EoE  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritus of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About RegeneronRegeneron (NASDAQ: REGN) is a leading biotechnology company that invents  develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

That’s according to a senior regulatory compliance expert at Wolters Kluwer Compliance Solutions.“Identifying the root causes leading to the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank is still very much a work in progress. Significant  meaningful efforts are underway in the federal government to comprehensively investigate and review these failures and help avert additional problems ” said Timothy Burniston  Senior Advisor  Regulatory Strategy for Wolters Kluwer Compliance Solutions. “However  what we can point to in the early days of these developments is that regulators and major banks are collectively working to stem further losses and instill confidence.”Federal regulators moved promptly following the failures of SVB and Signature to ensure that customers were able to access all of their deposits  beyond the $250 000 insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. First Republic Bank  meanwhile  received $30 billion in deposits from 11 major banks as part of an effort to support that institution.“This past weekend  we saw further mitigation efforts by the Federal Reserve and five central banks across the globe with the announcement of a coordinated expansion in the frequency of dollar swap line arrangements to help boost liquidity as part of a growing response to banking industry turmoil. We also saw UBS announce its acquisition of Credit Suisse to help shore up global markets ” he noted. “And we expect more positive measures by regulators and the industry to address and calm the current turbulence in the industry in the days to come.”Burniston cites economic factors that may have played a role in these collapses  reinforced by Wolters Kluwers’ most recent Regulatory & Risk Management Indicator survey  the results of which indicated that 73% of respondents were highly concerned about interest rate increases.He emphasized that for each failed institution  resolution and review processes should be allowed to play out and that close attention should be paid to the lessons learned to help others avoid the same fate.“Although there are many open questions that will be answered in the coming weeks  we should be encouraged by the regulators and industry leaders that stepped forward assertively and decisively to help prevent far greater detrimental effects to the banking industry ” said Burniston.Wolters Kluwer Compliance Solutions is a market leader and trusted provider of risk management and regulatory compliance solutions and services to U.S. banks  credit unions  insurers and securities firms.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that the European Commission (EC) has approved Dupixent® (dupilumab) in the European Union (EU) to treat severe atopic dermatitis in children aged 6 months to 5 years old who are candidates for systemic therapy. With this approval  Dupixent is the first and only targeted medicine indicated to treat these young children in Europe and the U.S.“Watching an infant or young child grapple with the debilitating and wide-reaching impacts of severe atopic dermatitis is heartbreaking ” said Korey Capozza  MPH  Founder and Executive Director of Global Parents for Eczema Research (GPER). “I’ve personally witnessed how this chronic skin disease can disrupt the lives of entire families when left uncontrolled. Intervening with effective treatments during infancy and early childhood can help manage the challenging impact this disease has on children and their families during such formative years.”Atopic dermatitis is a chronic type 2 inflammatory skin disease. Between 85% and 90% of patients first develop symptoms before 5 years of age  which can often continue through adulthood. Symptoms include intense  persistent itch and skin lesions that cover much of the body  resulting in skin dryness  cracking  pain  redness or darkening  crusting and oozing  which can increase the risk of skin infection. Severe atopic dermatitis may also significantly impact the quality of life of young children and their caregivers. Treatment options in this age group are primarily topical corticosteroids (TCS)  which can be associated with safety risks and may impair growth when used long-term.Story continues“No infant or child should have to spend their earliest days suffering with the intense and unrelenting itch and skin pain of atopic dermatitis ” said George D. Yancopoulos  M.D.  Ph.D.  President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron  and a principal inventor of Dupixent. “Too often the parents and caregivers of children with severe atopic dermatitis are left desperate for new treatments to manage this chronic disease. In the pivotal trial  Dupixent reduced itch and skin pain  and improved health-related quality of life and sleep quality. Dupixent is currently being used to treat more than 600 000 patients around the world across approved indications. This latest EU approval brings the proven efficacy and  importantly  the long-term safety profile of Dupixent to this particularly vulnerable population.”“A vast majority of people with atopic dermatitis begin to develop symptoms during their earliest  most vulnerable years  and these symptoms can often continue through the rest of their lives. With this latest approval  Dupixent is the first-ever biologic medicine for people living with atopic dermatitis from infancy to adulthood ” said Naimish Patel  M.D.  Head of Global Development  Immunology and Inflammation at Sanofi. “Given its well-established safety and efficacy profile  Dupixent has the potential to transform the landscape for people of all ages living with atopic dermatitis. We remain committed to exploring Dupixent for the treatment of other chronic inflammatory skin diseases.”The approval is based on data from a Phase 3 trial evaluating Dupixent every four weeks (200 mg or 300 mg based on body weight) plus low-potency TCS or TCS alone (placebo) in 162 children aged 6 months to 5 years with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. At 16 weeks  Dupixent improved skin clearance and reduced overall disease severity and itch compared to placebo in the overall enrolled population. In a subset of those with severe atopic dermatitis  patients randomized to Dupixent (n=63) experienced the following compared to placebo (n=62) at 16 weeks:46% of patients achieved 75% or greater improvement in overall disease severity compared to 7% treated with placebo  a co-primary endpoint.14% of patients achieved clear or almost clear skin compared to 2% treated with placebo  a co-primary endpoint.55% average reduction in overall disease severity from baseline compared to 10% with placebo.42% average reduction in itch from baseline compared to a 1% increase with placebo.Dupixent also improved sleep quality  skin pain and health-related quality of life compared to placebo in both the overall and severe populations. Long-term efficacy data showed the clinical benefit at 16 weeks was sustained through 52 weeks.The most common side effects across indications include injection site reactions  conjunctivitis  conjunctivitis allergic  arthralgia  oral herpes and eosinophilia. The safety results of the 6 months to 5 years old trial were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications; in the trial  adverse events more commonly observed (≥5%) with Dupixent compared to placebo included eosinophilia and conjunctivitis. The long-term safety profile through 52 weeks was similar to the safety profile observed at 16 weeks  and consistent with what was observed in older patients with atopic dermatitis.About the Pivotal Dupixent Atopic Dermatitis TrialThe Phase 3 randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent added to standard-of-care low-potency TCS compared to low-potency TCS alone (placebo) in 162 children aged 6 months to 5 years with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis.The co-primary endpoints assessed the proportion of patients achieving an Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) and 75% improvement in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI-75) at week 16. Additional endpoints measured itch (assessed by a caregiver-reported worst scratch/itch numerical rating scale from 0-10)  sleep quality (assessed by a caregiver-reported numerical rating scale from 0-10)  skin pain (assessed by a caregiver-reported numerical rating scale from 0-10) and health-related quality of life (assessed by the Children’s Dermatology Life Quality Index in patients aged 4 to 5 years and the Infants’ Dermatitis Quality of Life Index in patients aged 6 months to 3 years  both scales from 0-30).About DupixentDupixent is an injection administered under the skin (subcutaneous injection) at different injection sites. In patients aged 6 months to 5 years  Dupixent is administered with a pre-filled syringe every four weeks based on weight (200 mg for children ≥5 to <15 kg and 300 mg for children ≥15 to <30 kg). Dupixent is intended for use under the guidance of a healthcare professional and can be given in a clinic or at home by self-administration after training by a healthcare professional. In children younger than 12 years of age  Dupixent should be administered by a caregiver if given at home. Dupixent does not require initial lab testing or ongoing lab monitoring.Dupixent  which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune® technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent  such as atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) and prurigo nodularis.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP  EoE or prurigo nodularis in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in Europe  the U.S. and Japan. More than 600 000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create a substantial proportion of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Dupixent  Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent® (alirocumab)  Kevzara® (sarilumab)  Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb® (atoltivimab  maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including pediatric EoE  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritus of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. INDICATIONSDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe eczema (atopic dermatitis or AD) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies.

March 21  2023. The European Commission (EC) has approved Dupixent® (dupilumab) in the European Union (EU) to treat severe atopic dermatitis in children aged 6 months to 5 years old who are candidates for systemic therapy. With this approval  Dupixent is the first and only targeted medicine indicated to treat these young children in Europe and the U.S.Korey Capozza  MPHFounder and Executive Director of Global Parents for Eczema Research (GPER)“Watching an infant or young child grapple with the debilitating and wide-reaching impacts of severe atopic dermatitis is heartbreaking. I’ve personally witnessed how this chronic skin disease can disrupt the lives of entire families when left uncontrolled. Intervening with effective treatments during infancy and early childhood can help manage the challenging impact this disease has on children and their families during such formative years.”Atopic dermatitis is a chronic type 2 inflammatory skin disease. Between 85% and 90% of patients first develop symptoms before 5 years of age  which can often continue through adulthood. Symptoms include intense  persistent itch and skin lesions that cover much of the body  resulting in skin dryness  cracking  pain  redness or darkening  crusting and oozing  which can increase the risk of skin infection. Severe atopic dermatitis may also significantly impact the quality of life of young children and their caregivers. Treatment options in this age group are primarily topical corticosteroids (TCS)  which can be associated with safety risks and may impair growth when used long-term.Naimish Patel  M.D.Head of Global Development  Immunology and Inflammation at Sanofi“A vast majority of people with atopic dermatitis begin to develop symptoms during their earliest  most vulnerable years  and these symptoms can often continue through the rest of their lives. With this latest approval  Dupixent is the first-ever biologic medicine for people living with atopic dermatitis from infancy to adulthood. Given its well-established safety and efficacy profile  Dupixent has the potential to transform the landscape for people of all ages living with atopic dermatitis. We remain committed to exploring Dupixent for the treatment of other chronic inflammatory skin diseases.”George D. Yancopoulos  M.D.  Ph.D.President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron“No infant or child should have to spend their earliest days suffering with the intense and unrelenting itch and skin pain of atopic dermatitis. Too often the parents and caregivers of children with severe atopic dermatitis are left desperate for new treatments to manage this chronic disease. In the pivotal trial  Dupixent reduced itch and skin pain  and improved health-related quality of life and sleep quality. Dupixent is currently being used to treat more than 600 000 patients around the word across approved indications. This latest EU approval brings the proven efficacy  and importantly  the long-term safety profile of Dupixent to this particularly vulnerable population.”The approval is based on data from a Phase 3 trial evaluating Dupixent every four weeks (200 mg or 300 mg based on body weight) plus low-potency TCS or TCS alone (placebo) in 162 children aged 6 months to 5 years with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. At 16 weeks  Dupixent improved skin clearance and reduced overall disease severity and itch compared to placebo in the overall enrolled population. In a subset of those with severe atopic dermatitis  patients randomized to Dupixent (n=63) experienced the following compared to placebo (n=62) at 16 weeks:46% of patients achieved 75% or greater improvement in overall disease severity compared to 7% treated with placebo  a co-primary endpoint.14% of patients achieved clear or almost clear skin compared to 2% treated with placebo  a co-primary endpoint.55% average reduction in overall disease severity from baseline compared to 10% with placebo.42% average reduction in itch from baseline compared to a 1% increase with placebo.Dupixent also improved sleep quality  skin pain and health-related quality of life compared to placebo in both the overall and severe populations. Long-term efficacy data showed the clinical benefit at 16 weeks was sustained through 52 weeks.The most common side effects across indications include injection site reactions  conjunctivitis  conjunctivitis allergic  arthralgia  oral herpes and eosinophilia. The safety results of the 6 months to 5 years old trial were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications; in the trial  adverse events more commonly observed (≥5%) with Dupixent compared to placebo included eosinophilia and conjunctivitis. The long-term safety profile through 52 weeks was similar to the safety profile observed at 16 weeks  and consistent with what was observed in older patients with atopic dermatitis.About the Pivotal Dupixent Atopic Dermatitis TrialThe Phase 3 randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent added to standard-of-care low-potency TCS compared to low-potency TCS alone (placebo) in 162 children aged 6 months to 5 years with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis.The co-primary endpoints assessed the proportion of patients achieving an Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) and 75% improvement in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI-75) at week 16. Additional endpoints measured itch (assessed by a caregiver-reported worst scratch/itch numerical rating scale from 0-10)  sleep quality (assessed by a caregiver-reported numerical rating scale from 0-10)  skin pain (assessed by a caregiver-reported numerical rating scale from 0-10) and health-related quality of life (assessed by the Children’s Dermatology Life Quality Index in patients aged 4 to 5 years and the Infants’ Dermatitis Quality of Life Index in patients aged 6 months to 3 years  both scales from 0-30).About DupixentDupixent is an injection administered under the skin (subcutaneous injection) at different injection sites. In patients aged 6 months to 5 years  Dupixent is administered with a pre-filled syringe every four weeks based on weight (200 mg for children ≥5 to <15 kg and 300 mg for children ≥15 to <30 kg). Dupixent is intended for use under the guidance of a healthcare professional and can be given in a clinic or at home by self-administration after training by a healthcare professional. In children younger than 12 years of age  Dupixent should be administered by a caregiver if given at home. Dupixent does not require initial lab testing or ongoing lab monitoring.Dupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent  such as atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) and prurigo nodularis.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP  EoE or prurigo nodularis in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in Europe  the U.S. and Japan. More than 600 000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including pediatric EoE  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritus of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About RegeneronRegeneron (NASDAQ: REGN) is a leading biotechnology company that invents  develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

The growth embedded in contracts signed to date offers unique visibility and marks the turning point we have been waiting for. Optimising our resources to support Crossject’s ramp-up is now our priority  along the lines of the non-dilutive financing we have implemented. Thanks to the efforts of all our teams and the support of our shareholders  especially Gemmes Venture  a major shareholder from the early days  the Crossject story is only just beginning. The momentum for success is there and our teams are more motivated than ever to make us a key player in the pharma sector. Lastly  I would like to thank our investor and shareholder Vester Finance  which hs managed its bonds with great care in a long-term perspective.”Patrick Alexandre – Chairman of the Management BoardWith its patented needle-free self-injection system  Crossject aims to become the world leader in self-administered emergency medication. Crossject is a human-sized company working out of two sites (Dijon and Gray) and covering a wide range of activities  from the design/development of medicines to the preparation of their marketing and their manufacture.After 20 years of research and development  Crossject has achieved major clinical  industrial and commercial milestones in the last two years  laying solid foundations for its future.Emergency situationsCrossject specialises in pre-hospital emergencies. Patients diagnosed at risk of life-threatening seizures can get a prescription for their emergency dose from their doctor  fill the prescription in a pharmacy and then carry it with them at all times.People are generally not in a medical environment when they have seizures  so they either have to inject the emergency dose themselves or have it done by a member of their family  who is not a health professional. That is where our ZENEO® needle-free injector comes in. ZENEO® is pre-filled and single-use  very easy to understand and extremely safe to use. The ergonomics of our system owe much to cooperation with patient associations for several indications  and has been validated by more than 1 000 people in total on countless occasions. In most cases  an injection can be performed in under a minute  even in stressful situations or by someone unfamiliar with ZENEO®. In the latest “human factors” study in the United States ( see press release of 12 September 2022 )  an exceptional proportion of 99.6% of people successfully completed the injection.In addition  thanks to its ability to inject the dose in less than a tenth of a second (compared with several seconds for most conventional systems)  ZENEO® eliminates most of the risks of misuse.Efficacy of ZENEO®ZENEO® has a long history of proven efficacy and flexibility  with more than 10 clinical studies under its belt  including a 2014 bioequivalence study in combination with subcutaneous methotrexate.However  in most emergency situations  such as epilepsy or allergic shock  it is preferable to administer the drug by intramuscular injection  potentially through clothing. ZENEO® has recently demonstrated its ability to perform such injections (see our press release of 2 November 2022 announcing the positive readout of the ZENEO® Midazolam clinical study  developed for epileptic seizures). This makes Crossject the only company worldwide to offer a means of intramuscular injection (on bare skin or through clothing) in a fraction of a second.Crossject  developer of therapeutic solutionsCrossject is a developer of therapeutic solutions  working both on the ZENEO® medical device and on the combination of ZENEO® with a drug adapted to each therapeutic indication.As a company with ISO 13485 certification for the design  development  production and manufacture of a sterile single-use auto-injector (see our press release of 15 August 2022) and as a pharmaceutical company (see our press release of 16 November 2021)  Crossject is ideally positioned to develop innovative solutions.Marketing authorisation applications for the three priority indications (epilepsy  acute adrenal insufficiency  allergic shock) are scheduled to be submitted in 2024. However  the goal is still to file an Emergency Use Authorization application under the BARDA contract in 2023 (see below).It is important to note that Crossject used advanced reliability quantification techniques to develop ZENEO® in order to meet the FDA’s very demanding standards (at least 99.999% compliant injections  which is equivalent to less than ten mechanical failures per million injections).Crossject  manufacturerCrossject has a three-stage industrial chain for the manufacture of its medical devices. Upstream  the company subcontracts the manufacture of components to partners with the necessary expertise in plastic or metal injection  glass forming  elastomer moulding  etc. Crossject generally owns the specific tools  which are integrated into the partner’s industrial facilities.Downstream  Crossject sources its active ingredients from specialised chemical manufacturers and delivers them to a manufacturer specialised in the mixing and filling of sterile injectable liquid products (fill/finish). Crossject also supplies the manufacturer with a ready-to-fill kit consisting of two sub-assemblies: a sterile pharmaceutical sub-assembly  intended to receive the drug  prepared and shipped from Crossject’s Dijon site  and an actuator (the injector’s mechanical part)  assembled and shipped from Crossject’s Gray site.Crossject already has highly efficient industrial facilities; each piece of equipment has its own capacity  so the maximum capacity of the whole is determined by the slowest workstation; Crossject accordingly has production capacity of more than 500 000 ready-to-fill kits per year – capacity that is about to increase with the ongoing installation of new equipment recently delivered with the support of France Relance (press release of 10 March 2021).Crossject’s medium-term strategy is to grow its industrial capacity by removing bottlenecks as business needs change. The renovation of a 1000 sq.m. building on the Gray site (delivery scheduled before this summer) will allow Crossject to lift its capacity to more than 6 million units per year.MarketingCrossject initially chose to entrust the distribution of its products to pharmaceutical companies already established in the relevant geographies and therapeutic indications.The priority geographies are North America and Western Europe.Of the seven therapeutic indications in its portfolio  two are already covered by licensing agreements  namely acute adrenal insufficiency for North America (press release of 16 June 2021) and epilepsy for Germany (press release of 18 June 2019)  for which several milestones have been successfully achieved.A new indication could also be developed in partnership with an American laboratory (press release of 15 September 2022).Crossject’s epilepsy product is also the subject of a contract with BARDA (the US government agency that supports the research  development and manufacture of medical products for public health emergencies) (press release of 18 June 2022  contract no. 75A50122C00031). The total value of the contract – if all options are exercised – is $155 million and includes advanced regulatory development in the United States and the supply of products to the US Strategic National Stockpile  upon approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The aim is to start deliveries by the end of 2023  subject to obtaining Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA) from the Food Drug Administration (FDA).Crossject  a committed companyIn recent years  Crossject has demonstrated its commitment on CSR questions  with a gender equality index reading above 90 for two consecutive years and a significant increase in its GAIA index from 15 to 60 in just three years. The company has also received a Responsible Care® award  demonstrating its commitment to transforming itself into a major player in the field of life-saving emergency medicines.Financial information as of 31 December 2022In line with the business plan  the strengthening of our financial base to support the very substantial acceleration of our development was a real success in 2022. The €22 million financial reinforcement came from several sources;BARDA invoicing: $1.8 million invoiced in 2022Free allocation of equity warrants to all shareholders: €2.8 millionCapital increase with preferential subscription rights: €4.09 millionExercise of warrants: €0.2 millionNew borrowings: at the end of the year we completed a major non-dilutive financial transaction of €14 million  with €4 million in loans granted in 2022. The transaction includes various loans granted by long-standing banks (Caisse d’Epargne and BNP)  Société Générale and BPI  with amortisation periods ranging from 5 to 10 years  and nearly 85% of the total available immediately.All OC1223 convertible bonds were converted during the year and 95.7% of the OC1224 convertible bonds were converted during the year  the balance being converted this day.In the year ended 31 December 2022  we recorded a very substantial increase in operating income to €9.7 million  an increase of 43%.It includes €0.95 million in revenue relating to milestones achieved during the year.€ thousand  as of 31 December 2022 2021 Operating income 9 718 6 772 Operating expenses -23 005 -18 594 Purchases of raw materials and supplies -498 -954 Other purchases and external expenses -8 116 -5 901 Personnel expenses -7 424 -6 183 Taxes and duties -176 -202 Depreciation  amortisation and provisions -6 358 -5 013 Other expenses -433 -342 Operating profit/(loss) -13 288 -11 823 Financial income/(expense) -319 -774 Exceptional income/(expense) 228 81 Corporate tax 2 222 1 818 Net profit/(loss) -11 157 -10 698 The financial statements for the six months to 31 December 2022 were approved by the members of the Management Board on 20 March 2023 and presented at the Supervisory Board meeting of 20 March 2023. They have been audited.In addition  capitalised production increased by 13% to €6.1 million as a result of ongoing research and development activities.During the year  Crossject maintained its focus on cost control. Operating expenses increased by just 24%  a very moderate rise in relation to that of operating income.Other purchases and external expenses amounted to €8.1 million  compared with €5.9 million in 2021  attributable notably to the progress of production work linked to the BARDA contract  the completion of various clinical studies and batches on several drugs in the portfolio and the costs inherent to the industrial ramp-up in the broad sense.At the end of 2022  Crossject had approximately 100 employees  a slight increase compared with the end of 2021.

The audit procedures for the consolidated financial statements are currently underway.CHANGES IN ECONOMIC PORTFOLIOCBo Territoria is pursuing its strategy of real estate development in the commercial sector and  as of December 31  2022  held a diversified6 portfolio of commercial properties with solid underlying performances:valuation of €300.6 million excluding transfer taxes (81% of total assets) for 133 300 sq.m  stable over a year (€300.8 million at year-end 2021)  the delivery of the Combani warehouse and the development of the first Padel Indoor complex on Reunion Island  as well as the integration of the Outdoor assets (+€3.0 million)  which offset the rate effect applied by the appraisers (change in fair value down of €5.6 milllion excluding projects under construction);occupancy rate of 98%  vs 97% in 2021  confirming the quality of assets held;gross rental income of €23.8 million (including EMS);gross yield of 7.4% (vs 7.1% at year-end 2021).During the financial period  CBo Territoria sold 72 residential plots (17 plots for sale and 55 plots in blocks sold at the end of the year to SHLMR/Action Logement). At year-end 2022  the Group holds 215 residential plots that will be sold in the medium term.The Group's total economic assets7 are valued at €373.0 million excluding transfer duties  stable compared to year-end 2021  excluding housing disposals. It now consists of 81% of tertiary assets.

The gross rental income of the portfolio (excluding EMS) grew by 9.7% The increase includes +5.3% for the scope effect (mainly linked to the full-year effect of the Port retail park delivered in 2021)  +1.8% for indexation  +2.6% for the effect of the commercial dynamics and the end of franchises. Net commercial rental income increased by +8.7% to €22.6 million (+9.6%  excluding EMS of €3.2 million).Recurring net income (Group share) increased by 16.9% to €11.0 million over the year  thanks to tight control of structural costs.Strong increase in the Property Development margin driven by the Residential product mixProperty development revenues came to €57.2 million in 2022  down slightly (-3.7%). Some 79% of the business is residential  driven by sales of building plots on the tourist coast  which explains the increase in the property development margin for the year. The momentum of new retail and block residential programs has been maintained in a nevertheless more difficult economic environment thanks to the quality of the assets developed and the tax measures in force. Commercial property development  an opportunistic activity  amounted to €11.8 million this year (-11.6%).Overall  the change in the product mix shows a high margin rate of 21.4% (+2.5 points compared with 2021)  i.e.  a development margin of €12.2 million  up 8.9%.Earnings from operations up by 16 1% and Net income Group share up by 1.5%The operating income increased by 16 1% to €26.4 million euros at the end of December 2022  driven by the growth of the two business lines and a sound control of structural costs.After factoring in capital gains on the disposal of residential assets and land (+€1.0 million)  income from the sale and revaluation of shares in the Outdoor business (+€1.0 million) and a change in fair value of -€4.5 million (compared with +€1.5 million in 2021)  Group net income came to €16.0 million  up +1.5% over the year  or €0.45 per share (compared with €0.44 in 2021).Net Asset Value: €237.5m (+5.5% vs. year-end 2021)On December 31  2022  the Net Asset Value was €237.5m  compared with €225.2m at the end of December 2021 (+5.5%). The annual increase of €12.3 million is explained by the strong results over the period  the positive impact of the mark-to-market of hedging instruments (€4.3 million after deferred tax) covering the €8.6 million dividend payment for 2021. On a per share basis  NAV increased by 5.5% to €6.63 over 12 months.Strong balance sheet and cash position - Recommended dividend for 2022 stable at €0.24/shareIn 2022  the Group has carried out the repayment of debt amounting to €34.1 million  including the repurchase of approximately 745 000 ORNANE bonds for €3.6 million (€4.87 per bond). The remaining amount to be repaid on the ORNANE bonds maturing in July 2024 now amounts to €26.4 million. Following these transactions  the Group's gross financial debt (bank and bond) will thus amount to €195.4 million at the end of 2022.After taking into account hedging instruments  85% of the financial debt bears interest at a fixed rate. The average cost of financial debt was 2.9% (compared with 2.8% on December 31  2021) with a stable maturity of 8 years and 1 month. At the end of December 2022  CBo Territoria had €35.2 million in available cash (+€7.6 million vs. the end of 2021) due to significant receipts of property development payments and the implementation of the planned fixed-rate financing (€11.2 million)  providing the Group with financial leeway to pursue its strategy.The LTV ratio excluding transfer taxes thus stood at 36.8%  down 7 points over the year. Leaving aside the valuation of hedging instruments (€3.9 million of financial assets)  it stood at 37.7%.Confident in its prospects  CBo Territoria will recommend to the General Meeting of June 7  2023  the payment of a stable dividend of €0.24 per share  guaranteeing the maintenance of a “balanced” distribution between financing the development of the Property Investment Company and shareholders' compensation.SOLID MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK AND 2023 GUIDANCEFor 2023  the Group's objective is to increase gross commercial rental income (including EMS) by 1%  pending the upcoming deliveries of Combani at the end of 2023  which will contribute as of 2024.In the medium term  CBo Territoria intends to further develop its portfolio thanks to its secure development model and its control of the entire real estate value chain  which offers solid prospects:the pipeline 8 of commercial projects under development represents an investment of €106 million  of which €26 million is currently under construction in Combani (Ylang Ylang shopping center marketed at 88% of potential rental income to date and an office building leased to Pôle Emploi) and €26 million of which construction is expected to be launched within 12 months;of commercial projects under development represents an investment of €106 million  of which €26 million is currently under construction in Combani (Ylang Ylang shopping center marketed at 88% of potential rental income to date and an office building leased to Pôle Emploi) and €26 million of which construction is expected to be launched within 12 months; in the Property Development business  visibility over the next 18 to 24 months is excellent  with a backlog of €44.6 million at the end of December 2022 (of which €41.9 million in residential)  an order book of €40.1 million (of which €39.7 million in residential)  and a residential offer for sale of €20.5 million.

March 21  2023. The European Commission (EC) has approved Dupixent® (dupilumab) in the European Union (EU) to treat severe atopic dermatitis in children aged 6 months to 5 years old who are candidates for systemic therapy. With this approval  Dupixent is the first and only targeted medicine indicated to treat these young children in Europe and the U.S.Korey Capozza  MPHFounder and Executive Director of Global Parents for Eczema Research (GPER)“Watching an infant or young child grapple with the debilitating and wide-reaching impacts of severe atopic dermatitis is heartbreaking. I’ve personally witnessed how this chronic skin disease can disrupt the lives of entire families when left uncontrolled. Intervening with effective treatments during infancy and early childhood can help manage the challenging impact this disease has on children and their families during such formative years.”Atopic dermatitis is a chronic type 2 inflammatory skin disease. Between 85% and 90% of patients first develop symptoms before 5 years of age  which can often continue through adulthood. Symptoms include intense  persistent itch and skin lesions that cover much of the body  resulting in skin dryness  cracking  pain  redness or darkening  crusting and oozing  which can increase the risk of skin infection. Severe atopic dermatitis may also significantly impact the quality of life of young children and their caregivers. Treatment options in this age group are primarily topical corticosteroids (TCS)  which can be associated with safety risks and may impair growth when used long-term.Naimish Patel  M.D.Head of Global Development  Immunology and Inflammation at Sanofi“A vast majority of people with atopic dermatitis begin to develop symptoms during their earliest  most vulnerable years  and these symptoms can often continue through the rest of their lives. With this latest approval  Dupixent is the first-ever biologic medicine for people living with atopic dermatitis from infancy to adulthood. Given its well-established safety and efficacy profile  Dupixent has the potential to transform the landscape for people of all ages living with atopic dermatitis. We remain committed to exploring Dupixent for the treatment of other chronic inflammatory skin diseases.”George D. Yancopoulos  M.D.  Ph.D.President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron“No infant or child should have to spend their earliest days suffering with the intense and unrelenting itch and skin pain of atopic dermatitis. Too often the parents and caregivers of children with severe atopic dermatitis are left desperate for new treatments to manage this chronic disease. In the pivotal trial  Dupixent reduced itch and skin pain  and improved health-related quality of life and sleep quality. Dupixent is currently being used to treat more than 600 000 patients around the word across approved indications. This latest EU approval brings the proven efficacy  and importantly  the long-term safety profile of Dupixent to this particularly vulnerable population.”The approval is based on data from a Phase 3 trial evaluating Dupixent every four weeks (200 mg or 300 mg based on body weight) plus low-potency TCS or TCS alone (placebo) in 162 children aged 6 months to 5 years with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. At 16 weeks  Dupixent improved skin clearance and reduced overall disease severity and itch compared to placebo in the overall enrolled population. In a subset of those with severe atopic dermatitis  patients randomized to Dupixent (n=63) experienced the following compared to placebo (n=62) at 16 weeks:46% of patients achieved 75% or greater improvement in overall disease severity compared to 7% treated with placebo  a co-primary endpoint.14% of patients achieved clear or almost clear skin compared to 2% treated with placebo  a co-primary endpoint.55% average reduction in overall disease severity from baseline compared to 10% with placebo.42% average reduction in itch from baseline compared to a 1% increase with placebo.Dupixent also improved sleep quality  skin pain and health-related quality of life compared to placebo in both the overall and severe populations. Long-term efficacy data showed the clinical benefit at 16 weeks was sustained through 52 weeks.The most common side effects across indications include injection site reactions  conjunctivitis  conjunctivitis allergic  arthralgia  oral herpes and eosinophilia. The safety results of the 6 months to 5 years old trial were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications; in the trial  adverse events more commonly observed (≥5%) with Dupixent compared to placebo included eosinophilia and conjunctivitis. The long-term safety profile through 52 weeks was similar to the safety profile observed at 16 weeks  and consistent with what was observed in older patients with atopic dermatitis.About the Pivotal Dupixent Atopic Dermatitis TrialThe Phase 3 randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent added to standard-of-care low-potency TCS compared to low-potency TCS alone (placebo) in 162 children aged 6 months to 5 years with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis.The co-primary endpoints assessed the proportion of patients achieving an Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) and 75% improvement in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI-75) at week 16. Additional endpoints measured itch (assessed by a caregiver-reported worst scratch/itch numerical rating scale from 0-10)  sleep quality (assessed by a caregiver-reported numerical rating scale from 0-10)  skin pain (assessed by a caregiver-reported numerical rating scale from 0-10) and health-related quality of life (assessed by the Children’s Dermatology Life Quality Index in patients aged 4 to 5 years and the Infants’ Dermatitis Quality of Life Index in patients aged 6 months to 3 years  both scales from 0-30).About DupixentDupixent is an injection administered under the skin (subcutaneous injection) at different injection sites. In patients aged 6 months to 5 years  Dupixent is administered with a pre-filled syringe every four weeks based on weight (200 mg for children ≥5 to <15 kg and 300 mg for children ≥15 to <30 kg). Dupixent is intended for use under the guidance of a healthcare professional and can be given in a clinic or at home by self-administration after training by a healthcare professional. In children younger than 12 years of age  Dupixent should be administered by a caregiver if given at home. Dupixent does not require initial lab testing or ongoing lab monitoring.Dupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent  such as atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) and prurigo nodularis.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP  EoE or prurigo nodularis in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in Europe  the U.S. and Japan. More than 600 000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including pediatric EoE  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritus of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About RegeneronRegeneron (NASDAQ: REGN) is a leading biotechnology company that invents  develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

The growth embedded in contracts signed to date offers unique visibility and marks the turning point we have been waiting for. Optimising our resources to support Crossject’s ramp-up is now our priority  along the lines of the non-dilutive financing we have implemented. Thanks to the efforts of all our teams and the support of our shareholders  especially Gemmes Venture  a major shareholder from the early days  the Crossject story is only just beginning. The momentum for success is there and our teams are more motivated than ever to make us a key player in the pharma sector. Lastly  I would like to thank our investor and shareholder Vester Finance  which hs managed its bonds with great care in a long-term perspective.”Patrick Alexandre – Chairman of the Management BoardWith its patented needle-free self-injection system  Crossject aims to become the world leader in self-administered emergency medication. Crossject is a human-sized company working out of two sites (Dijon and Gray) and covering a wide range of activities  from the design/development of medicines to the preparation of their marketing and their manufacture.After 20 years of research and development  Crossject has achieved major clinical  industrial and commercial milestones in the last two years  laying solid foundations for its future.Emergency situationsCrossject specialises in pre-hospital emergencies. Patients diagnosed at risk of life-threatening seizures can get a prescription for their emergency dose from their doctor  fill the prescription in a pharmacy and then carry it with them at all times.People are generally not in a medical environment when they have seizures  so they either have to inject the emergency dose themselves or have it done by a member of their family  who is not a health professional. That is where our ZENEO® needle-free injector comes in. ZENEO® is pre-filled and single-use  very easy to understand and extremely safe to use. The ergonomics of our system owe much to cooperation with patient associations for several indications  and has been validated by more than 1 000 people in total on countless occasions. In most cases  an injection can be performed in under a minute  even in stressful situations or by someone unfamiliar with ZENEO®. In the latest “human factors” study in the United States ( see press release of 12 September 2022 )  an exceptional proportion of 99.6% of people successfully completed the injection.In addition  thanks to its ability to inject the dose in less than a tenth of a second (compared with several seconds for most conventional systems)  ZENEO® eliminates most of the risks of misuse.Efficacy of ZENEO®ZENEO® has a long history of proven efficacy and flexibility  with more than 10 clinical studies under its belt  including a 2014 bioequivalence study in combination with subcutaneous methotrexate.However  in most emergency situations  such as epilepsy or allergic shock  it is preferable to administer the drug by intramuscular injection  potentially through clothing. ZENEO® has recently demonstrated its ability to perform such injections (see our press release of 2 November 2022 announcing the positive readout of the ZENEO® Midazolam clinical study  developed for epileptic seizures). This makes Crossject the only company worldwide to offer a means of intramuscular injection (on bare skin or through clothing) in a fraction of a second.Crossject  developer of therapeutic solutionsCrossject is a developer of therapeutic solutions  working both on the ZENEO® medical device and on the combination of ZENEO® with a drug adapted to each therapeutic indication.As a company with ISO 13485 certification for the design  development  production and manufacture of a sterile single-use auto-injector (see our press release of 15 August 2022) and as a pharmaceutical company (see our press release of 16 November 2021)  Crossject is ideally positioned to develop innovative solutions.Marketing authorisation applications for the three priority indications (epilepsy  acute adrenal insufficiency  allergic shock) are scheduled to be submitted in 2024. However  the goal is still to file an Emergency Use Authorization application under the BARDA contract in 2023 (see below).It is important to note that Crossject used advanced reliability quantification techniques to develop ZENEO® in order to meet the FDA’s very demanding standards (at least 99.999% compliant injections  which is equivalent to less than ten mechanical failures per million injections).Crossject  manufacturerCrossject has a three-stage industrial chain for the manufacture of its medical devices. Upstream  the company subcontracts the manufacture of components to partners with the necessary expertise in plastic or metal injection  glass forming  elastomer moulding  etc. Crossject generally owns the specific tools  which are integrated into the partner’s industrial facilities.Downstream  Crossject sources its active ingredients from specialised chemical manufacturers and delivers them to a manufacturer specialised in the mixing and filling of sterile injectable liquid products (fill/finish). Crossject also supplies the manufacturer with a ready-to-fill kit consisting of two sub-assemblies: a sterile pharmaceutical sub-assembly  intended to receive the drug  prepared and shipped from Crossject’s Dijon site  and an actuator (the injector’s mechanical part)  assembled and shipped from Crossject’s Gray site.Crossject already has highly efficient industrial facilities; each piece of equipment has its own capacity  so the maximum capacity of the whole is determined by the slowest workstation; Crossject accordingly has production capacity of more than 500 000 ready-to-fill kits per year – capacity that is about to increase with the ongoing installation of new equipment recently delivered with the support of France Relance (press release of 10 March 2021).Crossject’s medium-term strategy is to grow its industrial capacity by removing bottlenecks as business needs change. The renovation of a 1000 sq.m. building on the Gray site (delivery scheduled before this summer) will allow Crossject to lift its capacity to more than 6 million units per year.MarketingCrossject initially chose to entrust the distribution of its products to pharmaceutical companies already established in the relevant geographies and therapeutic indications.The priority geographies are North America and Western Europe.Of the seven therapeutic indications in its portfolio  two are already covered by licensing agreements  namely acute adrenal insufficiency for North America (press release of 16 June 2021) and epilepsy for Germany (press release of 18 June 2019)  for which several milestones have been successfully achieved.A new indication could also be developed in partnership with an American laboratory (press release of 15 September 2022).Crossject’s epilepsy product is also the subject of a contract with BARDA (the US government agency that supports the research  development and manufacture of medical products for public health emergencies) (press release of 18 June 2022  contract no. 75A50122C00031). The total value of the contract – if all options are exercised – is $155 million and includes advanced regulatory development in the United States and the supply of products to the US Strategic National Stockpile  upon approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The aim is to start deliveries by the end of 2023  subject to obtaining Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA) from the Food Drug Administration (FDA).Crossject  a committed companyIn recent years  Crossject has demonstrated its commitment on CSR questions  with a gender equality index reading above 90 for two consecutive years and a significant increase in its GAIA index from 15 to 60 in just three years. The company has also received a Responsible Care® award  demonstrating its commitment to transforming itself into a major player in the field of life-saving emergency medicines.Financial information as of 31 December 2022In line with the business plan  the strengthening of our financial base to support the very substantial acceleration of our development was a real success in 2022. The €22 million financial reinforcement came from several sources;BARDA invoicing: $1.8 million invoiced in 2022Free allocation of equity warrants to all shareholders: €2.8 millionCapital increase with preferential subscription rights: €4.09 millionExercise of warrants: €0.2 millionNew borrowings: at the end of the year we completed a major non-dilutive financial transaction of €14 million  with €4 million in loans granted in 2022. The transaction includes various loans granted by long-standing banks (Caisse d’Epargne and BNP)  Société Générale and BPI  with amortisation periods ranging from 5 to 10 years  and nearly 85% of the total available immediately.All OC1223 convertible bonds were converted during the year and 95.7% of the OC1224 convertible bonds were converted during the year  the balance being converted this day.In the year ended 31 December 2022  we recorded a very substantial increase in operating income to €9.7 million  an increase of 43%.It includes €0.95 million in revenue relating to milestones achieved during the year.€ thousand  as of 31 December 2022 2021 Operating income 9 718 6 772 Operating expenses -23 005 -18 594 Purchases of raw materials and supplies -498 -954 Other purchases and external expenses -8 116 -5 901 Personnel expenses -7 424 -6 183 Taxes and duties -176 -202 Depreciation  amortisation and provisions -6 358 -5 013 Other expenses -433 -342 Operating profit/(loss) -13 288 -11 823 Financial income/(expense) -319 -774 Exceptional income/(expense) 228 81 Corporate tax 2 222 1 818 Net profit/(loss) -11 157 -10 698 The financial statements for the six months to 31 December 2022 were approved by the members of the Management Board on 20 March 2023 and presented at the Supervisory Board meeting of 20 March 2023. They have been audited.In addition  capitalised production increased by 13% to €6.1 million as a result of ongoing research and development activities.During the year  Crossject maintained its focus on cost control. Operating expenses increased by just 24%  a very moderate rise in relation to that of operating income.Other purchases and external expenses amounted to €8.1 million  compared with €5.9 million in 2021  attributable notably to the progress of production work linked to the BARDA contract  the completion of various clinical studies and batches on several drugs in the portfolio and the costs inherent to the industrial ramp-up in the broad sense.At the end of 2022  Crossject had approximately 100 employees  a slight increase compared with the end of 2021. Personnel expenses amounted to €7.4 million in 2022  compared with €6.2 million in 2021  taking into account recruitments in 2022 aimed at obtaining more qualified skills better suited to our stage of development.The overall operating loss was €13.3 million  compared with a loss of €11.8 million in 2021.The Group recorded net financial expense of 0.3 million for 2022  compared with an expense of €0.9 million for 2021.After taking into account exceptional income of €0.2 million and a Research Tax Credit of €2.2 million  an increase of €0.4 million on 2021  the net loss for 2022 was €11.2 million.As of 31 December 2022  Crossject had cash of €8 million (€10 million at the end of 2021)  plus €6.2 million in non-dilutive financing announced at the end of the year and €3.8 million from the same plan  yet to be received  of which €2.0 million is conditional on obtaining Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA) from the Food Drug Administration (FDA).In view of current contracts (and in particular monthly invoicing to BARDA) and the very clear visibility Crossject has acquired in recent months  the company is confident in its ability to find the necessary financing to continue its development.Contacts:CrossjectPatrick Alexandreinfo@crossject.com Investor relationsAELIUMJérôme Gacoin +33 (0) 1 75 77 54 67crossject@aelium.frPress relationsBuzz & CompagnieMélanie Voisard +33 (0)6 12 52 53 15melanie.voisard@buzzetcompagnie.comChristelle Distinguin +33 (0)6 09 96 51 70christelle.distinguin@buzzetcompagnie.comAbout CROSSJECT • www.crossject.comCrossject (ISIN: FR0011716265; Ticker: ALCJ; LEI: 969500W1VTFNL2D85A65) is developing and is soon to market a portfolio of drugs dedicated to emergency situations: epilepsy  overdose  allergic shock  severe migraine and asthma attack.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that the European Commission (EC) has approved Dupixent® (dupilumab) in the European Union (EU) to treat severe atopic dermatitis in children aged 6 months to 5 years old who are candidates for systemic therapy. With this approval  Dupixent is the first and only targeted medicine indicated to treat these young children in Europe and the U.S.“Watching an infant or young child grapple with the debilitating and wide-reaching impacts of severe atopic dermatitis is heartbreaking ” said Korey Capozza  MPH  Founder and Executive Director of Global Parents for Eczema Research (GPER). “I’ve personally witnessed how this chronic skin disease can disrupt the lives of entire families when left uncontrolled. Intervening with effective treatments during infancy and early childhood can help manage the challenging impact this disease has on children and their families during such formative years.”Atopic dermatitis is a chronic type 2 inflammatory skin disease. Between 85% and 90% of patients first develop symptoms before 5 years of age  which can often continue through adulthood. Symptoms include intense  persistent itch and skin lesions that cover much of the body  resulting in skin dryness  cracking  pain  redness or darkening  crusting and oozing  which can increase the risk of skin infection. Severe atopic dermatitis may also significantly impact the quality of life of young children and their caregivers. Treatment options in this age group are primarily topical corticosteroids (TCS)  which can be associated with safety risks and may impair growth when used long-term.“No infant or child should have to spend their earliest days suffering with the intense and unrelenting itch and skin pain of atopic dermatitis ” said George D. Yancopoulos  M.D.  Ph.D.  President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron  and a principal inventor of Dupixent. “Too often the parents and caregivers of children with severe atopic dermatitis are left desperate for new treatments to manage this chronic disease. In the pivotal trial  Dupixent reduced itch and skin pain  and improved health-related quality of life and sleep quality. Dupixent is currently being used to treat more than 600 000 patients around the world across approved indications. This latest EU approval brings the proven efficacy and  importantly  the long-term safety profile of Dupixent to this particularly vulnerable population.”“A vast majority of people with atopic dermatitis begin to develop symptoms during their earliest  most vulnerable years  and these symptoms can often continue through the rest of their lives. With this latest approval  Dupixent is the first-ever biologic medicine for people living with atopic dermatitis from infancy to adulthood ” said Naimish Patel  M.D.  Head of Global Development  Immunology and Inflammation at Sanofi. “Given its well-established safety and efficacy profile  Dupixent has the potential to transform the landscape for people of all ages living with atopic dermatitis. We remain committed to exploring Dupixent for the treatment of other chronic inflammatory skin diseases.”The approval is based on data from a Phase 3 trial evaluating Dupixent every four weeks (200 mg or 300 mg based on body weight) plus low-potency TCS or TCS alone (placebo) in 162 children aged 6 months to 5 years with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. At 16 weeks  Dupixent improved skin clearance and reduced overall disease severity and itch compared to placebo in the overall enrolled population. In a subset of those with severe atopic dermatitis  patients randomized to Dupixent (n=63) experienced the following compared to placebo (n=62) at 16 weeks:46% of patients achieved 75% or greater improvement in overall disease severity compared to 7% treated with placebo  a co-primary endpoint.14% of patients achieved clear or almost clear skin compared to 2% treated with placebo  a co-primary endpoint.55% average reduction in overall disease severity from baseline compared to 10% with placebo.42% average reduction in itch from baseline compared to a 1% increase with placebo.Dupixent also improved sleep quality  skin pain and health-related quality of life compared to placebo in both the overall and severe populations. Long-term efficacy data showed the clinical benefit at 16 weeks was sustained through 52 weeks.The most common side effects across indications include injection site reactions  conjunctivitis  conjunctivitis allergic  arthralgia  oral herpes and eosinophilia. The safety results of the 6 months to 5 years old trial were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications; in the trial  adverse events more commonly observed (≥5%) with Dupixent compared to placebo included eosinophilia and conjunctivitis. The long-term safety profile through 52 weeks was similar to the safety profile observed at 16 weeks  and consistent with what was observed in older patients with atopic dermatitis.About the Pivotal Dupixent Atopic Dermatitis TrialThe Phase 3 randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent added to standard-of-care low-potency TCS compared to low-potency TCS alone (placebo) in 162 children aged 6 months to 5 years with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis.The co-primary endpoints assessed the proportion of patients achieving an Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) and 75% improvement in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI-75) at week 16. Additional endpoints measured itch (assessed by a caregiver-reported worst scratch/itch numerical rating scale from 0-10)  sleep quality (assessed by a caregiver-reported numerical rating scale from 0-10)  skin pain (assessed by a caregiver-reported numerical rating scale from 0-10) and health-related quality of life (assessed by the Children’s Dermatology Life Quality Index in patients aged 4 to 5 years and the Infants’ Dermatitis Quality of Life Index in patients aged 6 months to 3 years  both scales from 0-30).About DupixentDupixent is an injection administered under the skin (subcutaneous injection) at different injection sites. In patients aged 6 months to 5 years  Dupixent is administered with a pre-filled syringe every four weeks based on weight (200 mg for children ≥5 to <15 kg and 300 mg for children ≥15 to <30 kg). Dupixent is intended for use under the guidance of a healthcare professional and can be given in a clinic or at home by self-administration after training by a healthcare professional. In children younger than 12 years of age  Dupixent should be administered by a caregiver if given at home. Dupixent does not require initial lab testing or ongoing lab monitoring.Dupixent  which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune® technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent  such as atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) and prurigo nodularis.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP  EoE or prurigo nodularis in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in Europe  the U.S. and Japan. More than 600 000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create a substantial proportion of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Dupixent  Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent® (alirocumab)  Kevzara® (sarilumab)  Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb® (atoltivimab  maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including pediatric EoE  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritus of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. INDICATIONSDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe eczema (atopic dermatitis or AD) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies.

The company’s CEO  Andy Jassy  sent out a staff memo earlier today announcing plans to cut a further 9 000 positions in the next few weeks. The layoffs will mainly affect the AWS team  its People Experience and Technology Solutions (PXT Solutions) team  the company’s advertising unit and its Twitch streaming service team. “This was a difficult decision  but one that we think is best for the company long term… [given] the uncertain economy in which we reside and the uncertainty that exists in the near future ” wrote Jassy. He added that following several years of hiring “a significant amount” of people when it “made sense given what was happening in our businesses and the economy as a whole… the overriding tenet of our annual planning this year was to be leaner while doing so in a way that enables us to still invest robustly in the key long-term customer experiences that we believe can meaningfully improve customers’ lives and Amazon as a whole.” Amazon will confirm which specific roles will be affected by mid-to-late April and Jassy insisted the company will support those who lose their jobs with packages  including a separation payment  transitional health insurance benefits and external job placement support. “I remain very optimistic about the future and the myriad of opportunities we have  both in our largest businesses  stores and AWS  and our newer customer experiences and businesses in which we’re investing”  he added. Google parent Alphabet  Microsoft  Twitter  Snap and Ericsson have also significantly reduced their headcounts recently.Telecom Italia (TIM) is in discussions with unions about a 5% workforce reduction  which would affect 2 000 jobs  through the introduction of a voluntary early-retirement scheme  Reuters has reported. TIM is current seeking any way possible to reduce its costs and cut its debt pile of €25bn  and is currently engaged in a process that  it hopes  will result in the sale of NetCo  its fixed line and international networks business unit – see Crunch time for Telecom Italia as NetCo bids fall short.Liberty Global plans to increase its stake in Belgian cable and mobile service provider Telenet to more than 96% by offering minority shareholders €22 in cash per share  a premium of 59% compared with Telenet’s closing price on 15 March 2023  and a premium of 52% compared to the volume-weighted average trading price of Telenet’s shares during the previous month. Liberty Global currently holds a controlling 59.18% stake in Telenet and wants to own the rest of the shares  apart from the 3.12% stake held by Telenet itself. The board of the Belgian operator “unanimously supports and recommends the intended offer ” it noted in a statement issued on Tuesday. Telenet’s share price gained almost 40% to reach €21.24 on the Euronext exchange following the announcement. For the full year 2022  Telenet reported a 3% year-on-year increase in revenues to almost €2.7bn and a 4% dip in operating profit to €576m. It ended last year with 1.73 million broadband  1.7 million video/TV and 2.94 million mobile customers  while almost 824 000 customers take both fixed and mobile services  a 10% year-on-year increase. News of Liberty Global’s move came a day after the European Commission approved Orange Belgium’s acquisition of Belgian cable operator Voo – see Orange boosts its convergence play with green light for Belgian acquisition.The government of Hungary is set to increase its control over the national telecom sector  as state-owned Corvinus International Investment has acquired a minority stake in PPF Telecom Group’s operator Yettel Hungary through a share-swap deal. As part of the agreement  Corvinus International Investment is exchanging a 19.5% stake in Vodafone Hungary for a 25% stake in PPF Telecom Group’s subsidiaries in Hungary (owned by 4iG Group)  which include telecom operator Yettel Hungary  wholesale provider of active and passive telecoms infrastructure CETIN Hungary  and property company Yettel Real Estate Hungary. Corvinus International Investment’s stake in Vodafone Hungary has been acquired by Antenna Hungária for HUF17.7bn (US$48m)  which has boosted Antenna Hungária’s direct controlling stake in the Hungarian operator to 70.5%  while the state-owned company holds the remaining 29.5%. The Hungarian government has claimed that the move will diversify its investment portfolio in the sector while allowing the state to “more forcefully and efficiently contribute to the development of the industry ” reported Reuters.In the workers’ paradise that is North Korea  mobile telephony  such as it is  controlled and policed as it is  and expensive as it is  has been slow to spread amongst the ordinary public. Those devices and services that could be bought (handsets and SIMs alike) were priced in US dollars because the elite of the regime needed (and still need) hard currency from any source possible. And  of course  those that bought them were duly registered as their owners. Now  as the number of handsets in circulation slowly increases  pop-up stalls have  well  popped-up in markets across North Korea  selling pre-loved handsets that remain registered in the names of the original owners. Between 2017 and 2020  the North Korean authorities permitted the release of two or three new so-called “smartphone” models a year. As new ones were bought  individuals sold on their old handsets. Many of these so-called “daepo” phones were not re-registered and so became  to some extent  untraceable. The word ‘daepo’ has five meanings in the Korean language  the most common being “cannon” as in weaponry or “grog” as in booze (in general rum  and water in particular). Now it seems the sheer number of daepo phones in circulation is becoming a problem in a country where absolute control over everyone is the number one priority. So now the national telecoms law  that already prescribes and proscribes so much  is to be extended to make it illegal for anyone to own a daepo. The story comes from Daily NK  an online newspaper based in Seoul in South Korea that covers various aspects of life in North Korea (with information sourced from a network of brave and very necessarily anonymous North Korean informants). The person who broke the above story across the borders and into the wider world wrote  “The law was revised because phones used under borrowed names have spread across the entire country due to the indiscriminate sale of mobile phones and SIM cards. There continue to be cases where people can’t be punished because the phones they are using illegally aren’t in their own names.” So now it is illegal for the phones to be repaired or serviced  and service centres are compelled to report any person coming in for work to be done on a mobile phone. The regime rails daily about young people destroying their linguistic purity by using South Korean idioms or slang  and police and other agencies routinely wipe services and apps from any handsets that are deemed to be capable of getting round North Korea’s home-grown mobile security systems (in other words  all of them that don’t meet with official approval for any reason). Those found guilty of violating the new law  and in North Korea the conviction rate in courts is 99.999% recurring for any offence in any jurisdiction  get seven years hard labour in a “re-education camp”. Harsh.Pan-African network operator and digital service provider Liquid Intelligent Technologies has acquired Cairo  Egypt-based cloud and security services specialist Cysiv MEA (formerly SecureMisr) for an undisclosed sum. Cysiv MEA will adopt the Liquid C2 brand name  which is used for the Liquid group’s cloud operations  “to align it with its global cloud and cybersecurity identity ” noted Liquid Intelligent Technologies  which plans to “significantly grow the Egyptian business by tapping into the wealth of local tech talent  making Egypt a key hub for the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region.” David Behr  CEO of Liquid C2  added: “Liquid recognises the critical role Cysiv MEA has been playing in the cloud and cyber security industry in Egypt and the region. Our main task as a group is to support them in bringing more cyber security tools for our customers as they face an increasingly hostile global threat environment from cybercriminals and nation-state sponsored attackers. This will ensure that their business is protected whilst also meeting the demands for global compliance requirements.” Read more.The latest Internet Satisfaction Report survey  commissioned by Amdocs and carried out by Dynata  a research and analytics company headquartered in Connecticut  US  has found that 89% of Americans say they now have reliable broadband internet access  notes Telecompetitor. What’s more  they regard broadband access as much of a necessity of life as utility services such as gas  water and electricity. Meanwhile  demand for  and reliance on  broadband connectivity has accelerated to the extent that the number of households with more than nine internet connected devices has doubled in less than two years (though actual numbers were not specified in the report). Unsurprisingly  the number of devices per home correlates closely with household income  so the Amdocs survey shows that while 41% of families with annual incomes in excess of US$150 000 actually have more than nine internet connected devices  just 13% of “low-income” homes (defined in the report as earning less than $50 000 per annum) have fewer than nine devices. The survey  which canvassed the views of 1 000 US citizens  also found that  despite occasional outages and other connection issues  49% of families are happy with their home internet. What’s more  40% reported having no issues or difficulties whatsoever with their broadband  while a mere 11% said they had either occasional or more frequent connectivity problems. Interestingly  and as usual  politics plays its part in attitudes to broadband availability. Thus  61% of respondents said it is important that the persistent digital divide  which still bedevils some regions and conurbations of the US  finally be bridged before the 2024 presidential election. Meanwhile  26%  presumably in light of the furore about claims that the 2020 election was “stolen” from the loser Donald Trump  said it is ""extremely important"" to do so  while 35% felt it is of some importance  26% were “unsure” and 4% didn’t care either way. Turning to other areas  61% believe that AI  virtual reality  augmented reality and the metaverse will actually increase the digital divide rather than help bridge it. The remaining 39% were not concerned. Amusingly  there was no unanimity whatsoever on who should be responsible for closing the gap. Anthony Goonetilleke  Amdocs’ group president of technology and head of strategy  commented: “Failing to ensure universal connectivity only serves to exacerbate the digital divide  leaving those on the lower end of the socioeconomic ladder at an even greater disadvantage in their personal  professional  and academic pursuits. Given the role that technology and connectivity play in driving the global economy  it’s our collective responsibility to remain persistent in our efforts to close this gap.” As for the usual bones of contention – broadband speed and reliability – 52% of respondents said they would be willing to pay more for the former  while 38% would pay extra for the latter. The report also hinted that consumer attitudes to ISPs may have mellowed somewhat and approval of their services improved subsequent to the privations caused by the lockdowns that characterised the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic. During that period the reputations of many US ISPs took a battering  often with good reason.Less than six months after its launch  streaming giant Netflix has reportedly hit one million monthly active users (MOUs) for its Basic with Adverts subscription service in the US. According to internal data obtained by Bloomberg  the milestone was achieved two months after the service’s launch in November 2022 and the user base rose by more than 500% in its first month  in a sign of the times as the cost of living crisis takes hold. The report also claimed that most of the subscribers opting for the cheaper  ad-supported plan  are either new to Netflix or are relapsing customers rather than users who have downgraded from more pricey plans. In the US  the basic plan with ads starts at $6.99 per month compared with the entry-level price of $9.99 for the advert-free service.When it comes to stopping AI ripping-off artists’ works  the only way isn't ethics. Academics are helping artists to counter the dismal and pervasive trend for modern day thieves to use generative AI to rip-off original works  feed the stolen data sets into tools that have been built to read and copy visual styles  and then quickly and cheaply churn-out ersatz simulacra for ill-gotten gains. The Glaze project  underway at the University of Chicago in the US  has just launched a free  non-commercial app that artists can download to help prevent the theft of “artistic IP” via a new “cloaking” technique. The beta version of the new app is now available and works by adding miniscule “perturbations” to paintings and other artworks that will make the AI model misread the data that breaks down the essence of an individual artist’s particular style. The result is a generated impersonation that is nothing like anything the original artist would have produced  and therefore less valuable. TechCrunch  the US online publication that covers high-tech and start-up companies  spoke with Ben Zhao  professor of computer science at the University of Chicago and the project leader. He told TechCrunch  “What we do is try to understand how the AI model perceives its own version of what artistic style is. And then we basically work in that dimension – to distort what the model sees as a particular style. So it’s not so much that there’s a hidden message or blocking of anything… It is  basically  learning how to speak the language of the machine learning model  and using its own language — distorting what it sees of the art images in such a way that it actually has a minimal impact on how humans see. This comes from a fundamental gap between how AI perceives the world and how we perceive the world.” The root of the cheap “plausible pastiche” problem is that the makers of generative AI models rely on easy access to the public internet for data to train their models. Thus  artists who have displayed their work online which  usually  is about the only thing that can inexpensively do to attract an audience and potential buyers of their work  are regarded as fair game. Zhao added  “We’re trying to address this issue of artists feeling like they cannot share their art online. Particularly independent artists who are no longer able to post  promote and advertise their own work for commission – and that’s really their livelihood. So just the fact they can feel like they’re safer  and that it becomes much harder for someone to mimic them  means that we’ve really accomplished our goal. The large majority of artists out there can use this  they can feel much better about how they promote their own work and they can continue on with their careers and avoid most of the impact of the threat of AI models mimicking their style.”- The staff  TelecomTV",neutral,0.02,0.97,0.01,mixed,0.34,0.17,0.49,True,English,"['Telecom Italia', 'Liberty Global', 'AWS', 'Telenet', 'transitional health insurance benefits', 'key long-term customer experiences', 'external job placement support', 'volume-weighted average trading price', 'international networks business unit', 'Twitch streaming service team', 'successful Amazon Web Services', 'Cloud services giant AWS', 'state-owned Corvinus International Investment', 'Yettel Real Estate Hungary', 'newer customer experiences', 'second tech giant', 'AWS) cloud division', 'Google parent Alphabet', 'voluntary early-retirement scheme', 'passive telecoms infrastructure', 'Antenna Hungária', 'mobile service provider', 'PPF Telecom Group', 'national telecom sector', 'Belgian cable operator', 'industry news roundup', '2.94 million mobile customers', 'direct controlling stake', 'mobile services', 'Belgian operator Telenet', 'advertising unit', 'investment portfolio', 'AWS team', 'job cuts', 'closing price', '4iG Group', 'telecom operator', 'Yettel Hungary', 'second round', 'wholesale provider', 'Telecom Italia', '1.73 million broadband', '1.7 million video/TV', 'state-owned company', 'share price', 'Hungarian operator', 'headcount reduction', 'latest round', 'Liberty Global', 'other shareholders', 'Technology Solutions', 'PXT Solutions', 'difficult decision', 'several years', 'significant amount', 'overriding tenet', 'annual planning', 'customers’ lives', 'specific roles', 'late April', 'separation payment', '5% workforce reduction', 'debt pile', 'Crunch time', 'minority shareholders', 'previous month', 'controlling 59.18% stake', 'intended offer', 'Euronext exchange', 'full year', 'year increase', 'operating profit', 'European Commission', 'convergence play', 'green light', 'share-swap deal', 'workers’ paradise', 'North Korea', 'Belgian acquisition', 'CETIN Hungary', 'staff memo', 'People Experience', 'uncertain economy', 'near future', 'fixed line', 'NetCo bids', 'minority stake', 'Hungarian government', 'Vodafone Hungary', 'Andy Jassy', 'largest businesses', 'property company', '824,000 customers', '3.12% stake', '19.5% stake', '25% stake', 'today', 'knives', 'footsteps', 'Meta', '18,000 jobs', 'January', 'CEO', 'plans', '9,000 positions', 'weeks', 'layoffs', 'uncertainty', 'sense', 'way', 'mid', 'packages', 'myriad', 'opportunities', 'stores', 'Microsoft', 'Twitter', 'Snap', 'Ericsson', 'headcounts', 'discussions', 'unions', '2,000 jobs', 'introduction', 'Reuters', 'costs', 'process', 'cash', 'premium', '15 March', 'shares', 'rest', 'board', 'statement', 'Tuesday', 'announcement', 'revenues', '4% dip', 'move', 'Orange', 'Belgium', 'Voo', 'part', 'agreement', 'subsidiaries', 'active', 'HUF17', 'development']",2023-03-21,2023-03-22,telecomtv.com

The issuer is solely responsible for the content of this announcement.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Press releaseSaint-Mars-du-Désert  22 March 2023FLORENTAISE  the pioneer in low-carbon potting soils  launches its IPO on Euronext Growth® Paris-- Capital increase of approximately EUR28 million  which may be increased to approximately EUR32.2 million ifthe Extension Clause is fully exercised and to EUR37 million if the Over-Allotment Option is fully exercised-- EUR12 million subscribed via debt compensation by the family holding company Floreasy-- Subscription period: from 22 March 2023 until 4 April 2023 for the Public Offering (at 5:00pm OTC and8:00pm online) and until 5 April 2023 at 12pm for the Global Placement-- Indicative price range of the Offering: between EUR9.44 and EUR12.76 per share-- Eligible for PEA and PME-ETI (ex PEA-PME) equity savings plans[1]Florentaise  a pioneer in low-carbon potting soils  announces the launch of its initial public offering for the admission of its shares to trading on the Euronext Growth Paris® market (ISIN: FR001400GO75 - Ticker Code: ALFLO).The Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF) has approved the Prospectus under the number 23-078 on March 21st 2023  composed of the Registration Document approved on March 3rd  2023 under the number I.23-006  a Securities Note  and a summary of the Prospectus (included in the Securities Note and copied in the appendix of this press release)For more information on the planned IPO on Euronext Growth®  see: https://investir.florentaise.fr/enFlorentaise potting soils promote the preservation of peatlands A major ecological urgency to fight global warmingPeatlands are wetlands that account for only 3% of the world's surface area but capture 33% of the Earth's CO2  and host 50% of extremely rich biodiversity. Nearly half of the peatlands are now severely damaged due to their overexploitation[2].""Working to cease the exploitation and drainage of peatlands is one of the most effective ways to eliminate carbon from the atmosphere and thus curb global warming"" (IPCC - Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  July 2022).Today  the vast majority of potting soils sold to individuals and professionals (horticulturalists  nursery gardeners) still include peat  while the potting soils market is set to expand massively under the impetus of urban greening and the development of off-ground crops. In 2017  this market represented 112 million m3 worldwide for an estimated market volume of EUR6.7 billion and is expected to multiply by more than 4 to reach EUR28.3 billion by 2050[3]. To support this rapid development while preserving peatlands  ecological alternatives to peat-based compost are required urgently.Florentaise has developed proprietary solutions to reduce the intensive exploitation of peatlands and the resulting enormous greenhouse gas emissions. Hortifibre® and Turbofibre®  Florentaise's patented wood fibres developed using wood chips and tree bark  are tried-and-tested alternatives to the peat used in potting soils. These two eco-responsible products have a carbon footprint 20 to 50 times less than that of the peat used in potting soils[4]. The ramp-up of these two products will enable Florentaise to shut down the last authorised national peatland  operated by Florentaise  in France in 2026 (Baupte  Channel).The Group points out that peat already represents a minor proportion of its supplies with only 23% of the intrants used to produce potting soils. Thus  as of 30 June 2022  77% of the raw materials used in the production of potting soils did not contain peat. The Group's objective is to continue to reduce  progressively over this decade  the proportion of peat in the raw materials used in the production of its potting soils in order to be eventually peatless. [5].Florentaise  a French leader in potting soils and eco-innovative growing mediaFounded in 1973  Florentaise is100% owned by the Chupin family. The Group employs 245 FTEs and had generated revenue of EUR57.5 million[6] at 30 June 2022. Today  more than 600 own brands and retail brand references are available from the major retailers such as Truffaut  Botanic  Aldi  LIDL and Intermarché  allowing Florentaise to sell nearly one in five bags of substrates in France to the general public and to cover 12% of the professional market. Its successful development in France has enabled the Group to extend its reach beyond its borders through a presence in six other countries (England  the Netherlands  India  China  Estonia and soon in the United States).Since the Group's inception  innovations and R&D investments have been guided by a strong commitment to ecology with the early implementation of concrete measures to reduce its carbon footprint. This eco-awareness resulted in the implementation of a carbon footprint in 2009. Since that date  the Group has reduced the average carbon footprint of the potting soil delivered (per cubic meter) by more than 30%. It has notably reduced the impact of transport for each cubic meter delivered by around 47% thanks to the deployment of a multi-site strategy (9 sites currently)  limiting the number of kilometres travelled by raw materials and finished products. Today  65% of the raw materials used by the Group are sourced in France within a radius of less than 200 km from the production sites. 10% of raw materials are sourced within an average radius of more than 200 km in France and the balance (i.e. 25%) of raw materials mainly represents peat imported from the Baltic countries.Hortifibre® and Turbofibre®  innovative peat alternatives for new low-carbon potting soils:With 13 international patents from a R&D centre drawing on the support of more than a dozen experts  Florentaise is now an innovative player in the horticultural sector with more than 250 formulas tested each year and a pioneering position in low-carbon potting soil. Its lead in innovation and the environmental transition enabled the Group to market its patented Hortifibre® (from the 2000s) and Turbofibre® (from 2015) wood fibres  which are effective substitutes for peat. Porosity  drainage  aeration and water retention capacity  and agronomic performance are all on track  making it possible to forego the use of peat.It is in terms of the environmental transition that the Hortifibre® and Turbofibre® raw materials stand apart  enabling a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of around 20 to 50 times over the entire product life cycle  compared to peat.This innovative eco-offering is now competitive: with equal agronomic performance  a balanced mix of Florentaise solutions is 17% cheaper than a peat-based mix.The ""Bivis"" production line  a tried and tested industrial tool used to produce Florentian wood fibres.The manufacturing process for Hortifibre® and Turbofibre® wood fibres  which enables these products to achieve the performance necessary to replace peat  is unique and protected by Florentaise patents. These fibres are produced according to a specific process with a ""Bivis"" production line based on the extrusion and thermomechanical fibre refining of tree bark or wood chips of high-quality ingredients from the circulareconomy  with the sawmill waste (wood chips  bark) used being collected from local sawmills  some of which source mainly from PEFC-certified forests[7]. The key advantages of this process are the complete sanitisation of output materials while controlling granulometry. These wood fibres can then be either incorporated into the finished potting soil sold to end consumers in France or to other potting soils manufacturers for distribution outside France.In this context  Florentaise has acquired  from a partner manufacturer  several proprietary Bivis machines that it uses on its sites in France to manufacture potting soil while renting other Bivis machines to other land manufacturers based on an economic model that has recently transitioned to hourly rental and a maintenance contract (rental contract over a renewable 5-year period).Since 2006  Florentaise has renewed its agreement with the manufacturing partner for the right to exclusive use and distribution of the Bivis for horticultural purposes; this agreement expanded to the international level in 2021. Under this renewable exclusivity agreement  no actor can develop and sell the same machines anywhere in the world without risking an intellectual property violation; this applies to both the industrial machine itself and to the outbound wood fibres. The products obtained  Hortifibre® and Turbofibre®  are protected by Florentaise patents.Sale of potting soil in France: strengthening its positionsIn France  the Group already has a leading position among end consumers  representing 1 out of 5 bags sold in France (61% of the Group's revenue) and among professionals such as horticulturalists  landscapers and nursery gardeners (39% of sales).Among the general public  the recent and persistent growth of the gardening industry should enable the Group to consolidate its position with existing customers looking for responsible products and also to conquer new brands seeking added value for consumers. As a reminder  the Group already has leading brands such as Truffaut  Botanic and Mr. Bricolage  Super U  Casino  Intermarché  Lidl and Aldi among its clients.In the professional market  sales will be driven by the development of off-ground crops and the greening of cities.Sale of potting soil in China: continued accelerationPresent in China since 2016  the Group recognised the potential of this market very early on  favouring the development of off-ground crops rather than the exploitation of peatlands. The protection of wetlands is indeed a priority objective of China's ambitious green plan to reach peak emissions in 2030 and ""net zero"" in 2060. These commitments require global investments valued at between USD14 000 and USD17 000 billion according to the World Bank. In this market  Florentaise's development strategy is to duplicate the French model by drawing on local partnerships.Florentaise already has two plants  one established in 2016 in Jiangsu and the second in Guangdong in 2021. These units generated more than EUR11 million in revenue in 2022[8]  50% of which was included in Florentaise's pro forma financial statements as at 30 June 2022. With growth of more than 85% per year since 2020  the Group intends to strengthen its footprint in China with the installation of three new production units planned for 2023  2024 and 2025 in regions where it is not yet present.Bivis: roll-out of the rental model to international potting soils producersIn addition to the sale of substrates for professionals and consumers in France and China  Florentaise has developed a Bivis production line rental model for potting soils manufacturers in Europe and  potentially  in the United States.This offer consists of providing a turnkey solution based on a model of hourly rental combined with a maintenance package. There is no initial CAPEX to install the production line; the pre-assembly and on-site assembly of the Bivis as well as the maintenance provided by Florentaise form a range of services that meet the needs of manufacturers. For example  a leading potting soil manufacturer in the UK is already leasing six Bivis and has ordered seven others that are being installed. This model  which is complementary to that of the potting soil sales business  should enable the Group to accelerate its growth.Revenue from this activity is expected to amount to EUR3.4 million at the end of June 2024 and to account for 20% of estimated consolidated revenue by 2027.Inevitable end to the economic exploitation of peatlands: a regulatory framework already in place in certain countriesThe signature of an historic global agreement for the preservation of biodiversity and wetlands (including peatlands) was ratified by 117 countries at COP15 Biodiversity held in December 2022[9]. In Ireland  where peat is an historic resource  its industrial and commercial use has already been banned since 2019. This first at the European level is expected to lead to its total continent-wide ban by 2050[10].These developments should guide the potting soil market in a gradual shift towards the use of raw materials other than peat. Thus  while in 2017 the share of peat represented nearly 60% of professional potting soil  it is expected to account for less than 30%  or half the current amount  by 2050[11].With the funds raised as part of the IPO and the establishment of three new Bivis lines in France by the end of 2024  Florentaise is likely to be able to replace all the peat in its potting soil by 2030  subject to market conditions  the pace of adoption of peatless potting soils by customers and applicable regulations.Consolidated revenue of EUR120 million in 2027  with an operating margin of around 20%This ambition requires the Group to conquer and establish its presence on new markets in its historic potting soil sales activity in France and China. In France  with a full range of eco-innovative substrates  the Group aims to strengthen its position via the acquisition of new customers and the strengthening of commercial relations with existing customers. The Group also anticipates a promising market development for low-carbon potting soil and Florentaise solutions. In China  the launch of three new sites will enable the Group to accelerate its growth in a region that contributes significantly to the acceleration of sales and the improvement of its profitability.Florentaise will continue to promote its rental model with the aim of significantly expanding the Bivis fleet in service by 30 June 2027. At that date  the Group will target a fleet of 38 Bivis machines in operation. As a reminder  7 machines had already been installed as of 30 June 2022 and 7 additional machines are being installed and expected to be in service by 30 June 2023. The commercial pipeline of identified projects includes 15 machines  corresponding to EUR16.5 million in annual revenue. Three of these projects are at an advanced stage of discussion in Europe and the United States with installations planned between 1 July 2023 and 30 June 2024.Thus  by 2027  Florentaise plans to generate consolidated revenue of EUR120 million (with a breakdown of sales of 80% for potting soil and 20% from Bivis rentals). The execution of this roadmap should be accompanied by an improvement in profitability  driven by the rollout of the Bivis model offering higher margins and the development of the Potting soils business in China  which has a lighter cost structure. As such  the Company plans to increase its operating income to more than 20% of revenue in 2027.An IPO on Euronext Growth® Paris to support the development strategy and finance growthThe purpose of the Offer and the listing of the Company's shares on Euronext Growth® Paris is to enable the Group to finance the development of its current projects  to finance its working capital requirements and to support its growth strategy.The estimated net proceeds of the Offer amount to approximately 26.2 million euros based on a median price of the Indicative Range of which:-- 12 million euros will be subscribed by Floreasy by way of compensation for by set-off withunquestionable  liquid and due claims held by Floreasy with regard to the Company resulting from vendor loansgranted by Floreasy International Ltd to Florentaise in the context of the reorganisation of potting soil activitycarried out on 31 December 2022 (and in particular the acquisition by the Company of 50% of Fulan 2 from FloreasyInternational Ltd) for a total amount of EUR31 302 thousand.

A key composition of matter patent was allowed in China and an additional patent on the method of operation was granted in the US.Chinese patent application number 201880045801.6 was allowed on 7 March 2023. This key patent entitled “Direct sodium removal method  solution and apparatus to reduce fluid overload in heart failure patients” has already been granted in the US and Europe and is pending in other regions such as Australia  Canada and Japan. It protects the use of a sodium-free or low-sodium infusate that is administered into a patient’s peritoneal cavity to directly remove sodium  and thereby fluid from the body to alleviate fluid overload in heart failure patients with residual renal function.US patent number 11 602 583 B2 was granted on 14 March 2023 and covers the expansion of the method of operation for Sequana Medical’s DSR therapy using an implantable pump system. While the Company’s current focus is on Short Term DSR therapy using a peritoneal catheter  the additional US patent granted gives further flexibility to use implantable pump systems  such as its alfapump®  to provide patients with long-term support.To date  Sequana Medical has filed 16 patents for its DSR program of which 6 have been granted  covering a broad range of aspects  both for the method of operation and composition of matter.Ian Crosbie  Chief Executive Officer of Sequana Medical  commented: “As the evidence for DSR’s disease-modifying effect in heart failure grows  we continue to build a strong patent portfolio for our DSR program and the patent allowed in China is an important international reinforcement of that. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of healthcare burden in China with 4.5 million people suffering from heart failure.1 The Chinese market offers huge potential for DSR where we believe it represents a compelling treatment option in this large and growing heart failure market.Story continues“Following the long-lasting clinical benefits observed in our RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies  we are focusing on Short Term DSR therapy using a peritoneal catheter. Use of DSR therapy with an implantable pump system such as our alfapump could be of great relevance in particular populations of congestive heart failure patients requiring regular DSR therapy. Today’s announcement gives this approach further strong patent protection.”For more information  please contact:Sequana MedicalLies VannesteDirector Investor RelationsE: IR@sequanamedical.comT: +32 (0)498 053579Optimum Strategic CommunicationsNick Bastin  Jonathan Edwards  Vici RabbettsE: Sequana@optimumcomms.comT: +44 (0) 208 078 4357About DSR in congestive heart failureSequana Medical considers its proprietary DSR to be a disease modifying therapy for congestive heart failure. Fluid accumulation in heart failure patients is caused by the retention of too much sodium. The DSR drug-based approach directly tackles this key clinical problem of sodium overload  and works in partnership with the kidneys to safely and rapidly eliminate the excess fluid. Complementary to existing heart failure therapies  clinical proof-of-concept studies using the Company’s first-generation DSR product (DSR 1.0) have shown that DSR can i) safely  effectively and rapidly eliminate fluid overload in heart failure patients  ii) improve the health of the heart and preserve renal function  and iii) restore the ability of the kidney to manage the fluid and sodium naturally  resulting in a large and long-lasting reduction in the need for diuretic drugs. In DSR treated patients  there have been no congestion-related re-hospitalizations during the study follow-up period  all patients improved their NYHA status by at least one class and the clinical benefits observed in the clinical studies resulted in a 75% reduction in predicted one-year mortality of patients pre- vs. post-intensive DSR therapy based on the Seattle Heart Failure Model. The Company is currently preparing an IND application for its second-generation DSR product (DSR 2.0) in the US and plans to begin a US randomized controlled Phase 1/2a clinical trial in Q2 2023.About Sequana MedicalSequana Medical NV is a pioneer in treating fluid overload  a serious and frequent clinical complication in patients with liver disease  heart failure and cancer. These patients can have up to 15 liters of extra fluid in their bodies  causing major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficult breathing and restricted mobility that severely impacts daily life. Although diuretics are standard of care  the problem is that in many patients they are no longer effective and / or tolerable. There are limited effective treatment options for these patients  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing “diuretic-resistant” patient population.alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  delivering major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients and reducing costs for healthcare systems. The Company has reported positive primary endpoint data from the North American pivotal POSEIDON trial of the alfapump in recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis  enabling the filing of a Pre-Market Approval (PMA) application with the FDA  planned for H2 2023. Having delivered clinical proof-of-concept for DSR as a disease-modifying drug program for the treatment of heart failure  the Company is planning to commence MOJAVE  a US multi-centered randomized controlled Phase 1/2a clinical trial of DSR 2.0  in Q2 2023.Sequana Medical is listed on Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium. For further information  please visit www.sequanamedical.com.Important Regulatory DisclaimersThe alfapump® system is currently not approved in the United States or Canada. In the United States and Canada  the alfapump system is currently under clinical investigation (POSEIDON Trial) and is being studied in adult patients with refractory or recurrent ascites due to cirrhosis. For more information regarding the POSEIDON clinical trial see www.poseidonstudy.com. DSR® therapy is still in development and it should be noted that any statements regarding safety and efficacy arise from ongoing pre-clinical and clinical investigations which have yet to be completed. DSR therapy is currently not approved for clinical research in the United States or Canada. There is no link between DSR therapy and ongoing investigations with the alfapump system in Europe  the United States or Canada.Note: alfapump® is a registered trademark.

It earlier hit 260.50 euros  just above last week’s one-year low of 260.25  but again held chart support around that level.The deal allowing the safe export of grain from Ukrainian Black Sea ports was renewed on Saturday but Russia said it only agreed to a 60-day extension. “The market anticipated that the corridor would be extended and you can see that looking at prices. But the situation isn’t resolved and the uncertainty has been pushed back ” said Arthur Portier of consultancy Agritel. Traders stressed the deal would mean continued tough competition to EU wheat in export markets.“Ukrainian wheat is very cheap with supplies available and now they will be shipped out at least for the next two months ” one German trader said. “With the new crop only around four months away  it looks like the EU may face tough competition from Ukraine and Russia in export markets for the rest of the season.” Standard 12% protein wheat for March delivery in Hamburg was offered for sale at about 1 euro over the Euronext May contract with buyers seeking about 1 euro under.Turmoil in the banking sector and a sharp rise in the euro against the dollar curbed Euronext prices  dealers said.
