The new shares were offered pursuant to a private placement. The investors that purchase the shares include  among others  (either directly or through entities controlled by them) Robert Taub  who is the chairman of the board of directors  and Jürgen Hambrecht  who is an independent director. Together  those two investors purchase new shares for EUR 5.6 million in gross proceeds at an issue price equal to the closing price on Euronext Brussels on March 23  2023.As Robert Taub and Jürgen Hambrecht qualify as related parties of the Company  the board of directors applied the related parties procedure of article 7:97 of the Belgian Companies and Associations Code in connection with the participation of the aforementioned directors to the private placement. Within the context of the aforementioned procedure  prior to resolving on the private placement  a committee of three independent directors of the Company (the ""Committee"") issued an advice to the board of directors in which the Committee assessed the participation of the two aforementioned investors in the private placement. In its advice to the board of directors  the Committee concluded the following: ""Based on the information provided  the Committee considers that the proposed Transaction is in line with the strategy pursued by the Company  will be done on market terms  and is unlikely to lead to disadvantages for the Company and its shareholders (in terms of dilution) that are not sufficiently compensated by the advantages that the Transaction offers the Company"".The Company's board of directors approved the principle of the private placement and did not deviate from the Committee's advice. The Company's statutory auditor's assessment of the Committee's advice and the minutes of the meeting of the Company's board of directors  is as follows: ""Based on our limited review  performed in accordance with ISRE 2410 ""Review of interim financial information performed by the independent auditor of the entity"" and the applicable standards of the ""Institut des Réviseursd'Entreprises/Instituut der Bedrijfsrevisoren""  nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the financial and accounting data contained in the minutes of the board of directors' meeting of March 23  2023 and in the report of the committee of independent directors in accordance with article 7: 97 of the Companies and Associations Code would contain material inconsistencies with the information available to us in the course of our engagement. However  we do not express an opinion on the value of the transaction or on the appropriateness of the decision of the board of directors"".IMPORTANT INFORMATIONTHIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION  DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY  IN ANY JURISDICTION WHERE TO DO SO WOULD BE PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

New item§13 - Place for general meetings - General meetings shall be held in Mölndal or Gothenburg  as determined by the board of directors.Item 17 - Resolution to adopt a long-term incentive programme for senior executives and key individuals in the XVIVO groupThe Board of Directors' of XVIVO Perfusion AB (publ) (the ""Company"" or ""XVIVO"") propose that the Annual General Meeting resolve on (17A.) the adoption of an incentive programme in the form of performance-based share option rights directed at the group management and key individuals of the XVIVO group (the ""SORP 2023""). The resolution pursuant to item (17A.) shall also be conditional on the Annual General Meeting deciding on hedging measures in accordance with the Board's proposal under item (17B.) below.17A. Introduction of the SORP 2023Background and rationaleThe Board of Directors of the Company is of the opinion that incentive programmes lead to higher motivation and commitment among the employees and strengthen the ties between the employees and the Company. Furthermore  it is the Board's assessment that the SORP 2023 will contribute to the opportunities to retain knowledgeable and experienced employees and is expected to increase the employees' interest in the Company's operations and development of earnings. Overall  it is the Board's assessment that the SORP 2023 will benefit both the employees and the Company's shareholders through an increased share value.Summary of the programmeThe SORP 2023 is proposed to comprise of the group management and key individuals  meaning that not more than approximately ten (10) persons within the XVIVO group will be able to participate.Under the SORP 2023  participants are given the opportunity to receive shares free of charge  so called ""Performance Shares""  in accordance with the terms and conditions described below. An offer to participate in the SORP 2023 shall be made as soon as practicably possible.Within the scope of the SORP 2023  the Board of Directors will grant participants rights free of charge entailing the right to  provided that certain criteria are fulfilled  receive Performance Shares (""Rights"").Terms and conditionsThe maximum number of shares will amount to 94 622  whereby 72 000 Performance Shares may be allotted to participants and 22 622 shares may be utilised by the Company to cover social security contributions associated with the programme. Vesting of Rights occurs during the period from 15 May 2023 up to and 15 May 2026 (""Vesting Period""). To be granted the Rights  the participant must have been employed or engaged within the XVIVO group throughout the whole Vesting Period  unless the Board of Directors in its sole discretion decides otherwise. The Rights may not be transferred or pledged. Each Right entitles the participant to receive one Performance Share  free of charge  at the end of the Vesting Period (with some exceptions whereas the Vesting Period can be brought forward). If the participant's employment or engagement ends before the end of the Vesting Period  the already earned Rights will be lost and will not entitle to Performance Shares  unless the Board of Directors in its sole discretion decides otherwise. Allotment of Performance Shares under the Rights is  except for the above stated  conditional on the achievement of the performance targets established by the Board of Directors in whole or in part. The ""Performance Target"" is based on the average annual total shareholder return (""TSR"") during the Vesting Period as follows. If the Company's TSR amounts to or exceeds 12 per cent  100 per cent of the Performance Shares will be allocated. If the Company's TSR amounts to 11 per cent  87.5 per cent of the Performance Shares will be allocated. If the Company's TSR amounts to 10 per cent  75 per cent of the Performance Shares will be allocated. If the Company's TSR amounts to 9 per cent  62.5 per cent of Performance Shares will be allocated. If the Company's TSR amounts to 8 per cent  50 per cent of the Performance Shares will be allocated. If the Company's TSR is less than 8 per cent  no allotment of the Performance Shares will take place.1. The Board of Directors  or a special committee set up by the Board  shall be responsible for preparing the detailed design and administration of the terms and conditions of the SORP 2023  in accordance with the presented terms and conditions including provisions on recalculation in the event of an in-between bonus issue  share split  rights issue and/or similar measures. In connection therewith  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to make adjustments to meet specific foreign regulations or market conditions. The Board of Directors shall also be entitled to make other adjustments if significant changes occur in the XVIVO Group or in its environment that would result in that the adopted terms for the SORP 2023 no longer fulfils their objectives.Allocation of RightsThe SORP 2023 shall comprise of not more than approximately 10 employees within the XVIVO group. The maximum number of Rights that can be allotted free of charge per participant and category follows from the table below.Category Maximum number of Rights per category CEO 12 000 Other Key Individuals within the XVIVO Group 6 000CostsThe SORP 2023 will be reported in accordance with ""IFRS 2 - Share-related remuneration"". IFRS 2 stipulates that the Rights shall be expensed as personnel costs over the Vesting Period. Personnel costs in accordance with IFRS 2 do not affect the Company's cash flow. Social security contributions will be expensed in the income statement in accordance with UFR 7 during the Vesting Period.The cost of the SORP 2023 is assumed to amount to approximately MSEK 10.0  excluding social security contributions  calculated in accordance with IFRS 2 supported by the Monte Carlo valuation model on the basis of the following assumptions: (i) a closing share price on Nasdaq Stockholm on 22 March 2023 corresponding to SEK 244.5  (ii) a volatility of 45 per cent  and (iii) a risk-free interest rate of 2.6 per cent.Based on the same assumptions as above  and subject to social security contributions of 31.42 per cent  and a share price increase of approximately 40.5 per cent from the start of the SORP 2023 until the participants are allotted Performance Shares (corresponding to a yearly TSR of 12 per cent)  the costs of social security contributions are estimated to amount to approximately MSEK 7.8. To illustrate  assuming that 72 000 Performance Shares are allotted at approximately SEK 343.5  that the actual market price at the time of the free of charge allocation amounts to MSEK 24.7 and with other conditions equal regarding social security contributions  the total cost of the SORP 2023 would amount to MSEK 17.7.Effects on key ratios and dilutionBased on the existing number of shares in the Company  the SORP 2023  upon exercise of all 72 000 Rights and 22 622 shares for hedging of social security costs  will result in the share capital being able to increase by a maximum of SEK 2 418.420435 and a maximum dilution corresponding to approximately 0.32 per cent of the capital outstanding at the time of issue of the notice and the number of votes in the Company. If all outstanding incentive programmes in the Company are included in the calculation  the corresponding maximum dilution  at the time of issuing the notice  amounts to approximately 0.72 per cent of the capital and the number of votes.The SORP 2023 is expected to have only a marginal impact on key performance indicators.Preparation of the proposalThe SORP 2023 has been prepared by the Board of Directors in consultation with external advisers.Additional ongoing share-based incentive programmesInformation regarding the Company's current incentive programmes is available in the Company's annual report 2022  note 23 and the main terms and conditions of the programmes are available on the Company's website  www.xvivogroup.com. Apart from the programmes now mentioned  there are no other share-based incentive programmes in XVIVO.Delivery of Performance Shares in accordance with the SORP 2023In order to be able to implement the SORP 2023 in a cost-effective and flexible manner  the Board of Directors has considered various methods to ensure delivery of Performance Shares. In doing so  the Board of Directors has found that the most cost-effective option  for the delivery of Performance Shares and coverage of social security contributions  is to issue warrants. The Board of Directors therefore proposes that the Annual General Meeting  in accordance with item (17B.) below  resolves to issue a total of not more than 94 622 warrants to the wholly owned subsidiary XVIVO Perfusion Lund AB with the right and obligation to manage the warrants in accordance with the Board's directives.17B. Directed issue of warrants under the SORP 2023 to the wholly owned subsidiary XVIVO Perfusion Lund AB and approval of subsequent subscription of shares on behalf of employees in connection with exerciseThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves  with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  to issue a total of not more than 94 622 warrants  as a result of which the Company's share capital may increase by a maximum of SEK 2 418.420435. The Board of Directors also proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to approve that the wholly owned subsidiary XVIVO Perfusion Lund AB  within the framework of the SORP 2023  may exercise the warrants for new subscription of shares on behalf of employees in connection with the end of the term 15 May 2026.The issue of warrants shall be subject to the following conditions:The right to subscribe for the 94 622 warrants shall  with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  only vest with the wholly owned subsidiary XVIVO Perfusion Lund AB. XVIVO Perfusion Lund AB shall have the right to exercise the warrants for new subscription of shares on behalf of employees in connection with the end of the term 15 May 2026. The warrants shall be issued free of charge and shall be subscribed for on a subscription list no later than 15 May 2023. The Board of Directors shall have the right to extend the subscription period. Oversubscription cannot take place. Each warrant shall entitle the holder to subscribe for one share in the Company. The subscription price for shares subscribed for based on the warrants shall correspond to the quota value of the shares. The subscription price shall be paid in cash. Subscription of shares pursuant to the warrants shall take place during the period from 15 May 2026 to and including 15 June 2026. The Board of Directors has the right to extend the subscription period  however  by a maximum of six months. Shares which are issued following subscription shall entitle to dividend on the record date for dividends that falls immediately after the new shares have been entered in the Company's share register with Euroclear Sweden AB. The detailed terms of the warrants are set out in Appendix A.The subscription price  as set out above  shall be rounded to the nearest SEK 0.10  whereby SEK 0.05 shall be rounded downwards. The subscription price and the number of shares that each warrant entitles to subscription for shall be recalculated in the event of a split  consolidation  new share issue etc. in accordance with market practice.It is further proposed that the board of directors  or whomever they appoint  should be authorized to undertake such minor adjustments in the resolution that may be required for the registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights is to implement the SORP 2023 for employees in the XVIVO Group.Special authorisationsThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting instructs the Board of Directors to execute the resolution above and to ensure that the SORP 2023 is implemented in accordance with what is stated above.The Board further proposes that the Annual General Meeting instruct the Board  or whomever the Board appoints  to make such minor adjustments in the abovementioned proposed resolutions that may prove necessary in connection with registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.Item 18 - Resolution to authorise the board of directors to resolve on new share issuesThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to authorise the Board of Directors  for the period until the end of the next Annual General Meeting  on one or several occasions and with or without deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  to resolve on new share issues.The authorisation may be utilised for new issues of shares  which may be made with provisions regarding contribution in cash  in kind or through set-off corresponding to not more than 10 per cent of the registered share capital in the Company at the time of the issue resolution. The subscription price shall be determined on market terms and conditions. However  in order to enable delivery of shares in connection with a cash issue as described above  this may  if the Board of Directors deems it appropriate  be made at a subscription price corresponding to the quota value of the shares  whereby the issue is directed to an issuing agent that acts as a settlement bank for investors.Deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights shall be possible in connection with future investments in the form of acquisitions of operations  companies  shares in companies or otherwise for the Company's future expansion. If the Board resolves on an issue with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  the rationale shall be that the Board shall be able to issue shares in the Company to be used as a means of in-kind payment or the right to offset debt or to in a flexible and cost-efficient manner raise capital to use as means of payment or to continuously adjust the Company's capital structure.The Board of Directors  or any person appointed by the Board of Directors  shall have the right to make any adjustments or amendments of the above resolution which may be required in connection with the registration of such resolution and to take any other measure deemed necessary for the execution of the resolution.Item 19 - Resolution to authorise the Board of Directors to resolve on acquisition of the Company's own sharesThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to authorise the Board of Directors  for the period until the end of the next Annual General Meeting  on one or several occasions  to resolve to acquire the Company's own shares. Shares may be acquired to the extent that the Company's holding of its own shares  on any occasion  does not exceed ten (10) per cent of the Company's total outstanding shares. Acquisitions of shares shall take place on Nasdaq Stockholm at a price within the price interval registered at any given time  by which is meant the interval between the highest purchase price and the lowest sale price. Payment for the shares shall be made in cash. The purpose of the proposed authorisation is to give the Board the opportunity to adapt the Company's capital structure to its capital needs and thereby  among other things  be able to use the repurchased shares as a means of payment for the acquisition of assets or rights.The Board of Directors  or any person appointed by the Board of Directors  shall have the right to make any adjustments or amendments of the above resolution which may be required in connection with the registration of such resolution and to take any other measure deemed necessary for the execution of the resolution._______________________Special majority requirementThe Board of Directors' proposal for resolutions in accordance with 17A - 17B above constitute a package  as the various proposals are dependent on and strongly linked to each other. Therefore  it is proposed that the Annual General Meeting make a single resolution in connection with the abovementioned proposals  in compliance with the majority requirement specified in Chapter 16  Section 8 of the Swedish Companies Act  meaning that the resolution shall be supported by shareholders representing at least nine tenths (9/10) of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the meeting.For valid resolutions in accordance with item 16  18 and 19 above  it is required that the proposals be supported by at least two thirds (2/3) of the shares represented and votes cast at the general meeting.Shareholders' right to obtain informationShareholders are reminded of their right to  at the Annual General Meeting  obtain information from the Board of Directors and CEO in accordance with Chapter 7 Section 32 of the Swedish Companies Act.

Authorizing the Board to decide on purchasing the company's own shares The Board of Directors proposes to the Annual General Meeting that the Board of Directors is authorized to decide on the re-purchase of the company's own shares as follows: The Board of Directors is authorized to decide on the purchase of a maximum of five million (5 000 000) company shares  which accounts for 7.7% of all shares of the company at the time of publication the summons to the Annual General Meeting. Company shares will be purchased with funds from the company's non-restricted equity  in which case the acquisition will decrease the company's distributable non-restricted equity. The decision to purchase own shares may not be made in such a way that the total number of own shares held or pledged by the company and its subsidiaries exceeds one tenth of all shares. The shares will be acquired otherwise than in proportion to the share ownership of the shareholders via public trading arranged by Nasdaq Helsinki Ltd at the market price on the date on which the acquisition is made or otherwise at a price formed on the market. The shares can be purchased to develop the company's capital structure  to be used as remuneration in corporate acquisitions or the funding of other business arrangements  or as part of the company's incentive system or otherwise to be forwarded  to be retained by the company  or to be annulled. The Board of Directors will decide on other matters related to the acquisition of the company's shares. The authorization cancels the authorization given in the Annual General Meeting on 21 April 2022 to repurchase the company's own shares. The authorization is valid for 18 months from when it was granted. 17. Authorizing the Board of Directors to decide on share issue  granting shares and issue of special rights entitling to shares The Board proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorizes the Board to decide on giving or granting shares  and issue special rights entitling to shares as referred in Chapter 10 Section 1 of the Finnish Limited Liability Companies Act with the following terms: The shares and special rights entitling to shares can be given through one or more issues with or without a consideration.The number of shares to be issued based on the authorization can be no more than 12 000 000 shares  including special rights entitling to shares  which accounts for 18.5% of all of the company's shares at the time of publication the summons to the Annual General Meeting. The Board shall decide on the terms and conditions of share issues and special rights entitling to shares. The authorization applies to both the issue of new shares and the transfer of own shares. Share issues and granting special rights entitling to shares can be issued in deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights if the company has a weighty financial reason (directed share issue). Directed share issue can be carried out without consideration only if it is beneficial to the company and all of its shareholders and it has a weighty financial reason. The authorization cancels the authorization given in the Annual General Meeting on 21 April 2022 to decide on share issues and the issue of special rights entitling their holders to share. The authorization shall be valid until 30 June 2024. For reasons of clarity the authorization granted to the Board of Directors in this section or otherwise in this Annual General Meeting to decide on share issue  granting of option rights and the issue of special rights entitling their holders to shares will neither cancel nor replace: (i) the authorization granted to the Board to decide on issue of option rights or other special rights entitling their holders to shares (among others but without limitation to (a) authorization registered on 26 May 2016 at 14:21:08 maximum of 900 000 pcs of shares and (b) authorization registered on 22 May 2019 at 15:05:25 maximum of 900 000 pcs of shares)  (ii) already registered option and special rights entitling their holders to shares decisions (decisions registered P004 (29.12.2016 / 15:44:02)  P005 (07.12.2017/10:45:54)  P006 (22.07.2019/09:26:54)  P007 (10.12.2019/11:47:45)  P008 (19.11.2020/10:23:20) and P009 (11.01.2022/15:26:55)  P010 (05.05.2022/12:11:50) and P011 (21.11.2022 00:01:37)  which remain in force. 18.

The resolution pursuant to item (17A.) shall also be conditional on the Annual General Meeting deciding on hedging measures in accordance with the Board's proposal under item (17B.) below. 17A. Introduction of the SORP 2023 Background and rationale The Board of Directors of the Company is of the opinion that incentive programmes lead to higher motivation and commitment among the employees and strengthen the ties between the employees and the Company. Furthermore  it is the Board's assessment that the SORP 2023 will contribute to the opportunities to retain knowledgeable and experienced employees and is expected to increase the employees' interest in the Company's operations and development of earnings. Overall  it is the Board's assessment that the SORP 2023 will benefit both the employees and the Company's shareholders through an increased share value. Summary of the programme The SORP 2023 is proposed to comprise of the group management and key individuals  meaning that not more than approximately ten (10) persons within the XVIVO group will be able to participate. Under the SORP 2023  participants are given the opportunity to receive shares free of charge  so called ""Performance Shares""  in accordance with the terms and conditions described below. An offer to participate in the SORP 2023 shall be made as soon as practicably possible. Within the scope of the SORP 2023  the Board of Directors will grant participants rights free of charge entailing the right to  provided that certain criteria are fulfilled  receive Performance Shares (""Rights""). Terms and conditions The maximum number of shares will amount to 94 622  whereby 72 000 Performance Shares may be allotted to participants and 22 622 shares may be utilised by the Company to cover social security contributions associated with the programme. Vesting of Rights occurs during the period from 15 May 2023 up to and 15 May 2026 ("" Vesting Period ""). To be granted the Rights  the participant must have been employed or engaged within the XVIVO group throughout the whole Vesting Period  unless the Board of Directors in its sole discretion decides otherwise. The Rights may not be transferred or pledged. Each Right entitles the participant to receive one Performance Share  free of charge  at the end of the Vesting Period (with some exceptions whereas the Vesting Period can be brought forward). If the participant's employment or engagement ends before the end of the Vesting Period  the already earned Rights will be lost and will not entitle to Performance Shares  unless the Board of Directors in its sole discretion decides otherwise. Allotment of Performance Shares under the Rights is  except for the above stated  conditional on the achievement of the performance targets established by the Board of Directors in whole or in part. The "" Performance Target "" is based on the average annual total shareholder return ("" TSR "") during the Vesting Period as follows. If the Company's TSR amounts to or exceeds 12 per cent  100 per cent of the Performance Shares will be allocated. If the Company's TSR amounts to 11 per cent  87.5 per cent of the Performance Shares will be allocated. If the Company's TSR amounts to 10 per cent  75 per cent of the Performance Shares will be allocated. If the Company's TSR amounts to 9 per cent  62.5 per cent of Performance Shares will be allocated. If the Company's TSR amounts to 8 per cent  50 per cent of the Performance Shares will be allocated. If the Company's TSR is less than 8 per cent  no allotment of the Performance Shares will take place. The Board of Directors  or a special committee set up by the Board  shall be responsible for preparing the detailed design and administration of the terms and conditions of the SORP 2023  in accordance with the presented terms and conditions including provisions on recalculation in the event of an in-between bonus issue  share split  rights issue and/or similar measures. In connection therewith  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to make adjustments to meet specific foreign regulations or market conditions. The Board of Directors shall also be entitled to make other adjustments if significant changes occur in the XVIVO Group or in its environment that would result in that the adopted terms for the SORP 2023 no longer fulfils their objectives. 2 Allocation of Rights The SORP 2023 shall comprise of not more than approximately 10 employees within the XVIVO group. The maximum number of Rights that can be allotted free of charge per participant and category follows from the table below. Category Maximum number of Rights per category CEO 12 000 Other Key Individuals within the XVIVO 6 000 Group Costs The SORP 2023 will be reported in accordance with ""IFRS 2 - Share-related remuneration"". IFRS 2 stipulates that the Rights shall be expensed as personnel costs over the Vesting Period. Personnel costs in accordance with IFRS 2 do not affect the Company's cash flow. Social security contributions will be expensed in the income statement in accordance with UFR 7 during the Vesting Period. The cost of the SORP 2023 is assumed to amount to approximately MSEK 10.0  excluding social security contributions  calculated in accordance with IFRS 2 supported by the Monte Carlo valuation model on the basis of the following assumptions: (i) a closing share price on Nasdaq Stockholm on 22 March 2023 corresponding to SEK 244.5  (ii) a volatility of 45 per cent  and (iii) a risk-free interest rate of 2.6 per cent. Based on the same assumptions as above  and subject to social security contributions of 31.42 per cent  and a share price increase of approximately 40.5 per cent from the start of the SORP 2023 until the participants are allotted Performance Shares (corresponding to a yearly TSR of 12 per cent)  the costs of social security contributions are estimated to amount to approximately MSEK 7.8. To illustrate  assuming that 72 000 Performance Shares are allotted at approximately SEK 343.5  that the actual market price at the time of the free of charge allocation amounts to MSEK 24.7 and with other conditions equal regarding social security contributions  the total cost of the SORP 2023 would amount to MSEK 17.7. Effects on key ratios and dilution Based on the existing number of shares in the Company  the SORP 2023  upon exercise of all 72 000 Rights and 22 622 shares for hedging of social security costs  will result in the share capital being able to increase by a maximum of SEK 2 418.420435 and a maximum dilution corresponding to approximately 0.32 per cent of the capital outstanding at the time of issue of the notice and the number of votes in the Company. If all outstanding incentive programmes in the Company are included in the calculation  the corresponding maximum dilution  at the time of issuing the notice  amounts to approximately 0.72 per cent of the capital and the number of votes. The SORP 2023 is expected to have only a marginal impact on key performance indicators. 3 Preparation of the proposal The SORP 2023 has been prepared by the Board of Directors in consultation with external advisers. Additional ongoing share-based incentive programmes Information regarding the Company's current incentive programmes is available in the Company's annual report 2022  note 23 and the main terms and conditions of the programmes are available on the Company's website  www.xvivogroup.com. Apart from the programmes now mentioned  there are no other share-based incentive programmes in XVIVO. Delivery of Performance Shares in accordance with the SORP 2023 In order to be able to implement the SORP 2023 in a cost-effective and flexible manner  the Board of Directors has considered various methods to ensure delivery of Performance Shares. In doing so  the Board of Directors has found that the most cost-effective option  for the delivery of Performance Shares and coverage of social security contributions  is to issue warrants. The Board of Directors therefore proposes that the Annual General Meeting  in accordance with item (17B.) below  resolves to issue a total of not more than 94 622 warrants to the wholly owned subsidiary XVIVO Perfusion Lund AB with the right and obligation to manage the warrants in accordance with the Board's directives. 17B. Directed issue of warrants under the SORP 2023 to the wholly owned subsidiary XVIVO Perfusion Lund AB and approval of subsequent subscription of shares on behalf of employees in connection with exercise The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves  with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  to issue a total of not more than 94 622 warrants  as a result of which the Company's share capital may increase by a maximum of SEK 2 418.420435. The Board of Directors also proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to approve that the wholly owned subsidiary XVIVO Perfusion Lund AB  within the framework of the SORP 2023  may exercise the warrants for new subscription of shares on behalf of employees in connection with the end of the term 15 May 2026. The issue of warrants shall be subject to the following conditions: The right to subscribe for the 94 622 warrants shall  with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  only vest with the wholly owned subsidiary XVIVO Perfusion Lund AB. XVIVO Perfusion Lund AB shall have the right to exercise the warrants for new subscription of shares on behalf of employees in connection with the end of the term 15 May 2026. The warrants shall be issued free of charge and shall be subscribed for on a subscription list no later than 15 May 2023. The Board of Directors shall have the right to extend the subscription period. Oversubscription cannot take place. Each warrant shall entitle the holder to subscribe for one share in the Company. 4 The subscription price for shares subscribed for based on the warrants shall correspond to the quota value of the shares. The subscription price shall be paid in cash. Subscription of shares pursuant to the warrants shall take place during the period from 15 May 2026 to and including 15 June 2026. The Board of Directors has the right to extend the subscription period  however  by a maximum of six months. Shares which are issued following subscription shall entitle to dividend on the record date for dividends that falls immediately after the new shares have been entered in the Company's share register with Euroclear Sweden AB. The detailed terms of the warrants are set out in Appendix A . The subscription price  as set out above  shall be rounded to the nearest SEK 0.10  whereby SEK 0.05 shall be rounded downwards. The subscription price and the number of shares that each warrant entitles to subscription for shall be recalculated in the event of a split  consolidation  new share issue etc. in accordance with market practice. It is further proposed that the board of directors  or whomever they appoint  should be authorized to undertake such minor adjustments in the resolution that may be required for the registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office. The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights is to implement the SORP 2023 for employees in the XVIVO Group. Majority requirements and special authorisations The Board of Directors' proposal for resolutions in accordance with 17A - 17B above constitute a package  as the various proposals are dependent on and strongly linked to each other. Therefore  it is proposed that the Annual General Meeting make a single resolution in connection with the abovementioned proposals  in compliance with the majority requirement specified in Chapter 16  Section 8 of the Swedish Companies Act  meaning that the resolution shall be supported by shareholders representing at least nine tenths (9/10) of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the meeting. The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting instructs the Board of Directors to execute the resolution above and to ensure that the SORP 2023 is implemented in accordance with what is stated above. The Board further proposes that the Annual General Meeting instruct the Board  or whomever the Board appoints  to make such minor adjustments in the abovementioned proposed resolutions that may prove necessary in connection with registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office. _________________________ Gothenburg in March 2023 XVIVO Perfusion AB (publ) The Board of Directors 5 Attachments Original LinkOriginal DocumentPermalink Disclaimer Xvivo Perfusion AB published this content on 23 March 2023 and is solely responsible for the information contained therein.

21200,Clearstream,Bing API,https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2023/03/setback-iran-us-court-orders-168-billion-payout-1983-beirut-bombing,Setback for Iran as US court orders $1.68 billion payout for 1983 Beirut bombing,Background: Reuters reported that judge Loretta Preska in the US District Court in the Southern District of New York ordered Iran’s central bank and the Luxembourg-based Clearstream Banking SA to pay $1.68 billion to the families of the US Marines who died.,March 23  2023A US judge ordered Iran on Wednesday to pay nearly $1.7 billion to the families of US soldiers killed in the 1983 Beirut bombing. The ruling may be appealed  but the order constitutes a legal setback for the Iranian government and could further damage US-Iran relations.Background: Reuters reported that judge Loretta Preska in the US District Court in the Southern District of New York ordered Iran’s central bank and the Luxembourg-based Clearstream Banking SA to pay $1.68 billion to the families of the US Marines who died. Clearstream is currently holding the relevant assets in a fund.The case relates to the 1983 attack when two suicide bombers used truck bombs to blow up barracks housing US Marines and French soldiers in Lebanon. The soldiers were in the country as part of an international peacekeeping mission amid the Lebanese civil war. A total of 241 US soldiers and 58 French soldiers were killed  in addition to six civilians and the two suicide bombers.A group known as Islamic Jihad took credit for the attack. US officials have long accused Iran and its Lebanese militant proxy Hezbollah of being involved in the attack. There is no consensus that Hezbollah existed at the time  though it emerged in Lebanon in the 1980s.There have been numerous legal proceedings against the Iranian government since then. A 2020 US Supreme Court decision ordered the case to be reconsidered due to the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act. Preska determined that this law enabled the families to seize the assets  according to Reuters.Clearstream's parent company  Deutsche Boerse AG  told Reuters it is considering an appeal. In the past  the Iranian central bank argued that it has sovereign immunity. This principle grants legal immunity to foreign governments in other governments’ legal systems.US courts have rejected this argument in a different case involving Iran. In 2019  the US Justice Department charged Turkey's Halkbank with helping Iran evade US sanctions. Halkbank  which is majority owned by the Turkish state  claimed sovereign immunity  but two US courts rejected Halkbank's past appeals. The US Supreme Court heard arguments for the case in January.Lawyers for the victims' families and the Iranian central bank did not respond to Al-Monitor’s request for comment. The Iranian government did not appear to immediately comment on the ruling.Why it matters: The ruling could result in the families finally receiving compensation  according to some observers.Matthew Levitt  a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy  told Al-Monitor  “Clearstream may try to appeal  so payment may be delayed  but it is likely to happen at least in part.”Levitt  who previously served as a senior official on terrorism and financial intelligence at the US Treasury Department  said the judge’s decision is a blow to the Iranian government.“Cases such as these will not on their own put an end to Iranian-sponsored terrorism  but they do exact a tangible cost ” he said. “It is not just a factor of the financial judgement  but also the findings of guilt by a federal court that provide important messaging holding Iran accountable as a rogue actor in the court of public opinion.”The ruling could also further damage US-Iran relations. US President Joe Biden resumed talks with the Iranian government in 2021 on the latter's nuclear program  but those negotiations have stumbled over Iran's support for Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the ongoing protests in Iran.The Iranian government has criticized US court rulings on the Beirut bombing in the past. In 2016  then-Iranian President Hassan Rouhani called a ruling in the families' favor at the time a “continuation of hostilities against Iran.”Know more: Iran continues to maintain strong relations with Hezbollah.

The supervisory board will welcome four new directors: John Frederiksen and Cato H. Stonex  representing Famatown Finance Limited  and Marc Saverys and Patrick De Brabandere  representing CMB.Famatown is indirectly controlled by trusts settled by Frederiksen  who has been increasing his stake in Euronav through Famatown and related companies to over 22% following the termination of the merger agreement. The merger would have resulted in the world’s largest publicly-listed oil tanker owner and operator.CMB  controlled by the Saverys family of Belgium and holding a 25% stake in Euronav  had opposed the Frontline-Euronav merger. In January  CMB requested a general shareholders meeting to vote on resolutions that sought to replace the entire supervisory board with their own preferred candidates.Euronav has spent the past few months campaigning shareholders to reject CMB’s resolution  at least in part  criticizing it of attempting a “back-door” takeover of control and seeking to implement “a risky and self-interested strategy” that has not been clearly defined.Euronav has maintained that its recommendations for the supervisory board would provide proper representation and balance based on stakeholders’ interests. With the shareholders’ vote now solidifying the board’s composition  Euronav aims to move forward amidst the fallout of the failed merger and the ensuing battle between its largest shareholders.,neutral,0.01,0.9,0.09,negative,0.0,0.11,0.89,True,English,"['Euronav Shareholders', 'Board Shake', 'Merger Termination', 'Up', 'Norwegian shipping magnate John Frederiksen', 'Anne-Hélène Monsellato', 'Compagnie Maritime Belge', 'former independent directors', 'Grace Reksten Skaugen', 'four new directors', 'Cato H.

L&T plans to set up a Gigawatt-scale manufacturing facility for electrolyzers based on McPhy technology in India to serve the domestic requirements as well as cater to the other selected geographies2.The proposed agreement is in line with L&T’s strategic vision to be present across the green energy value chain and also furthers McPhy’s aim to expand beyond the European market.Commenting on the occasion  Mr. Subramanian Sarma  Whole Time Director (Energy)  L&T said  “The energy industry is undergoing a tectonic shift with Green Hydrogen emerging as a key fuel in the future energy basket. We are delighted to have signed this Agreement with McPhy which will be a win-win partnership given L&T’s strong presence across the entire value chain of manufacturing  EPC and services in the energy sector  and McPhy’s technology and research leadership in this sector”.“McPhy wants to be a global leader in the manufacture of electrolyzers. Joining forces with a major partner like Larsen & Toubro to address new markets is a great opportunity for McPhy and evidence of the attractiveness of its technology”  said Mr. Jean-Baptiste LUCAS  CEO of McPhy.“We are looking forward to an exciting journey where this partnership of L&T and McPhy will play a key role in creating a sustainable energy infrastructure for the future. The GreenHydrogen industry is at a nascent stage with an immense potential  and through this partnership both organizations will harness their inherent strengths to establish cost leadership through local manufacturing and sourcing”  said Mr. Derek M Shah  Sr. Vice President & Head  L&T Energy - Green Mfg. & Development.India is well suited for Green Hydrogen production due to the low generation costs of renewable electricity from abundantly available solar PV and wind power sources. The country aims to be among the world’s largest Green Hydrogen hubs and has grand plans for using the same across the sectors. It can also provide India the energy security by reducing the ever-increasing oil import bill while charting a pathway to green alternatives for “hard-to-abate” industries like refineries  fertilisers  steel  and transport.Green Hydrogen production capacity in India is estimated to grow to at least 5 MMTPA by 2030 in line with the nation’s Green Hydrogen Mission  which would call for investments upward of USD 100 billion.About McPhy:In the framework of the energy transition  and as a leading supplier of hydrogen production and distributionequipment  McPhy contributes to the deployment of low-carbon hydrogen throughout the world. Thanks to its wide range of products and services dedicated to the industrial  mobility and energy markets  McPhy provides turnkey solutions to its clients adapted to their applications in industrial raw material supply  fuel cell electric car refueling or renewable energy surplus storage and valorisation.

Full login details are available on our website: https://www.voltalia.com/fr/investor-relations.Story continues“2022 turnover increased and EBITDA was stable despite the sale in November 2021 of the VSM2 and VSM4 Brazilian plants  in line with the strategy  and a low level of resources. 2022 was operationally very dynamic with 442 megawatts commissioned and an increase of 884 megawatts in our plants under construction. This enabled us to reach our target of 2.6 gigawatts a year ahead of schedule  an increase of 52% in 2022.  This momentum has prepared 2023: the full-year effect of the 2022 commissioning  the 2023 commissioning expected of on going constructions  the contractual indexation of turnover to inflation and the effects of the service contracts already signed  reinforce 2023 EBITDA target. At the same time  in order to move forward to our new 2027 target  we are proud to have won a record 1.1 gigawatts of long-term power sales contracts in 2022  which will be backed by new power plants "" commented Sébastien Clerc  Voltalia’s CEO.KEY FIGURESIn € million 2022 2021 ChangeAt current exchange rates ChangeAt constant exchange rates4 Turnover5 469.0 358.7 +31% +24% EBITDA 137.4 137.6 stable -10% Net result  Group share -7.2 -1.3 na naTurnover set at €469.0 million  up +31% compared to 2021 (+24% at constant exchange rates). Turnover from Energy Sales increased by +18% and those from Services by +49% (after elimination of internal sales of Services)  thanks to growth in the Development  Construction and Equipment Procurement segment (+52%) and in the Operation & Maintenance segment (+20%).Consolidated EBITDA set at €137.4 million  stable compared to 2021 (-10% at constant exchange rates)  impacted by the deconsolidation of the VSM2 and VSM4 plants  sold in November 2021  in line with the Group strategy that develops more sites it wishes to keep  and by the decrease in wind resources.Net income  Group share  amounted to -€7.2 million  compared with -€1.3 million in 2021.REVIEW OF ACTIVITIESEnergy SalesFinancial key figures In € millionBefore eliminations of services provided internally 2022 2021 ChangeAt current exchange rates ChangeAt constant exchange rates Turnover 244.7 207.9 +18% +6% EBITDA 143.1 128.1 +12% +1% EBITDA margin 58% 62% -4pts -3 ptsOperational indicators2021 2020 Change LoadLong-term average (Voltalia) Factors6Long-termaverage(national) Production (in GWh) 3 680 4 143 -13% Installed capacity and under construction (in MW)7 2 592 1 709 +52% Wind load factor in Brazil 42% 49% -7pts 52% 39% Wind load factor in France 22% 29% -7pts 26% 21% Solar load factor in France 18% 17% +1pt 18% 15% Solar load factor in Egypt 25% 25% stable 23% NDTurnover up despite lower productionVoltalia’s operating capacity was 1 571 MW at the end of December 2022  up to +39% year-on-year  with 442 MW commissioned  mainly SSM1-2 in Brazil  South Farm in the UK  Stavria in Greece and Carrière des Plaines in France  and Helexia’s solar roofs in France  Portugal  Italy and Hungary.However  production is down by -13% to 3.7 terawatthours between 2021 and 2022. This change is explained by (i) the sale in November 2021 of the VSM2 and VSM4 wind farms in Brazil  which had produced 0.6 terawatthours in 2021  (ii) the weight of commissioning during the second half of the year  with no full-year effect in 2022  and (iii) lower resources than in 2021 due to unfavourable wind weather in Brazil and France  with load factors below the long-term average – but still higher than the country average  as in every year  illustrating Voltalia’s high selectivity for the best projects in the best locations.Despite the decrease in production  2022 turnover from Energy Sales is up by +18% (+6% at constant exchange rates) at €244.7 million.Turnover growth was driven by the increase in the average sales price per MWh due to: (i) contractual sales prices that are mostly indexed to inflation  (ii) the exit from the scope of power plants with low prices per MWh  replaced by projects with higher prices and (iii) the strengthening of the Brazilian real.The weighted average residual term of all electricity sales contracts is 16.5 years  representing €7.8 billion of future contracted turnover (+18% compared to 2021). 78% of the 2022 turnover from long-term power sales contracts is contractually indexed to inflation. This data illustrates Voltalia’s investment strategy  as power plants without long  indexed contracts are generally sold before construction  as are most subsidised projects.EBITDA upEnergy Sales  although impacted by a lower resource in 2022 than the long-term average  generated an EBITDA of €143.1 million  up to +12% (+1% at constant exchange rates).The EBITDA margin was 58%  down -4 points. With a wind and solar resource corresponding to the long-term average  the EBITDA margin would have been 62%.ServicesIn € millionBefore eliminations of services provided internally 2022 2021 ChangeAt current exchange rates ChangeAt constant exchange rates Turnover 352.3 220.1 +60% +58% Of which internal turnover 127.9 69.2 +85% +79% Of which external turnover 224.3 150.9 +49% +49% EBITDA 30.5 32.8 -7% -11% EBITDA margin 9% 15% -6pts -7ptsTurnover from Services (internal and external) set at 352.3 million  up to 60% (+58% at constant exchange rates).EBITDA decreased by -7% (-11% at constant exchange rates)  with an EBITDA margin of 9%  down 6 points(-7 points at constant exchange rates).Development  Construction and Equipment ProcurementThe Development  Construction and Equipment Procurement segment shows a turnover of €319.4 million  up to +66% (+65% at constant exchange rates).External turnover (to third party customers) increased by +52%. The business is growing rapidly thanks to sustained prospecting efforts. Development was driven by Brazil  while Construction and Equipment Procurement were dynamic in Europe and Africa. Equipment Procurement was the fastest growing business  as European demand has been particularly strong since the start of the war in Ukraine.Internal turnover (eliminated on consolidation) increased by 99% thanks to the dynamism of the new power plants launched on the balance sheet of Voltalia and its subsidiary Helexia.EBITDA for the Development  Construction and Equipment Procurement segment decreased by 11% in 2022 to €28.7 million. The EBITDA margin is 9%  down -8 points due to the combined effect of (i) the base effect of project disposals with the sale of VSM2 and VSM4 in 2021  (ii) inflation in the costs of certain equipments and services and (iii) the greater relative weight of Equipment Procurement  which is by nature low-risk and therefore less margined  than in 2021.Operation and maintenanceTurnover from the Operation & Maintenance segment reached €32.9 million  up to +19% (+15% at constant exchange rates). New external contracts (for third party customers) were signed for 694 MW  including 376 MW in Europe and 318 MW in Brazil. New internal contracts (whose turnover is eliminated in consolidation) have followed the growth of Voltalia’s operating power plants.At the end of 2022  the capacity under management for Voltalia and its third party customers is 4.4 GW (+29%)  of which 2.8 GW (+17%) is for external customers  demonstrating the commercial success of the Group’s offering.The segment showed €1.8 million EBITDA  multiplied by 2.7 in 2022 (and multiplied by 2.4 at constant exchange rates)  benefiting from scale effects in a context of cost control.OTHER ITEMS OF THE INCOME STATEMENTChange In € million 2022 2021 At actualrates At constant rates EBITDA before eliminations and corporate 173.7 160.9 +8% -1% Eliminations and corporate 36.3 23.3 +55% +54% EBITDA 137.4 137.6 stable stable Depreciation  amortisation  and provisions -81.5 -75.7 +8% 0% Operating revenue (EBIT) 55.9 61.9 -10% -24% Financial result -44.9 -43.9 +2% 10% Taxes and net income of equity affiliates -18.4 -16.8 +9% +5% Minority interests 0.2 -2.5 na na Net result (Group share) -7.2 -1.3 na naEBITDA before eliminations and corporate items increased by +8% to €173.7 million. Eliminations were up  reflecting the growth in internal activity. Corporate items were also up  but at a much lower rate than overall activity  illustrating Voltalia’s ability to generate economies of scale. Consolidated EBITDA was €137.4 million  stable compared to 2021.Depreciation  amortization and provisions amounted to 81.5 million  up +8%  mainly due to the depreciation of power plants commissioned in 2022  the full-year effect of power plants commissioned in 2021 and the deconsolidation of VSM2 and VSM4.At €45 million  net financial expenses slightly increased by +2%  reflecting the rigorous hedging policy that provided effective protection against rising interest rates on loans. The financial result also reflects the increase in project debt and corporate facilities8 of which 323 million was repaid after the capital increase.After taking into account minority interests and taxes  the net result  group share  amounts to -€7.2 million  compared to -€1.3 million in 2021.SIMPLIFIED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETVoltalia's balance sheet at the end of 2022 reached €3 billion  up to +44%.In € million 31/12/2022 31/12/2021 Goodwill 87 78 Tangible and intangible fixed assets 2 074 1 510 Cash and cash equivalents 384 291 Other assets 490 234 Total assets 3 035 2 113 Equity  Group share 1 232 672 Minorities 107 62 Financial debt 1 313 1 050 Provisions 26 14 Other current and non-current liabilities 357 315 Total liabilities 3 035 2 113With fixed assets up by +37%  the growth in the Group's assets is essentially linked to the increase in power plants in operation and  even more so  those under construction.Other assets amounted to €490 million at the end of 2022 and were up €256 million  of which (i) €201 million mainly corresponded to the increase in inventories  supplier advances and trade and tax receivables due to the growth of activities  including power plant projects under construction and (ii) €54 million increase in financial assets related to our hedging policy.The cash position stands at €384 million  up to +32% compared to the end of 2021. This level compares with total financial debt of €1 313 million at the end of 2022  up to +25%  in line with the growth of fixed assets.Equity is up 83%  mainly due to the successful capital increase in December 2022.The capital increase is also the main reason for the decrease of about 10 points in leverage Debt leverage9  which stands at 41%.NEW ANNOUNCEMENTS OF THE GROUPFuture contracted turnover up to €7.8 billion (+18%)Voltalia announced today that its long-term visibility has further improved with future turnover secured by electricity sales contracts amounting to €7.8 billion at the end of December 2022 (+€1.2 billion vs. 2021)  i.e. x16.6 of 2022 turnover. This particularly high level is the result of Voltalia's strategy of seeking very long-term electricity sales contracts covering most of the production of the power plants in its portfolio.Expansion of the portfolio of projects in development: 14.2 GW (+28%)Voltalia announced today that its portfolio of projects under development  to be retained or sold with construction and maintenance services  amounted to 14.2 GW at the end of December 2022  an increase of +3.1 GW in one year. Illustrating the growing importance of the geographical diversification strategy  this portfolio is split 38%  38% and 24% in Latin America  Europe and Africa respectively. In terms of technology  solar is the majority  at 65%  followed by wind at 29% and other technologies at 6%.In French Guiana  construction of the Sinnamary biomass plant  an investment of €200 millionVoltalia today announced the construction of the largest biomass power plant in French Guyana (10.6 MW).

L&T plans to set up a Gigawatt-scale manufacturing facility for electrolyzers based on McPhy technology in India to serve the domestic requirements as well as cater to the other selected geographies2.The proposed agreement is in line with L&T’s strategic vision to be present across the green energy value chain and also furthers McPhy’s aim to expand beyond the European market.Commenting on the occasion  Mr. Subramanian Sarma  Whole Time Director (Energy)  L&T said  “The energy industry is undergoing a tectonic shift with Green Hydrogen emerging as a key fuel in the future energy basket. We are delighted to have signed this Agreement with McPhy which will be a win-win partnership given L&T’s strong presence across the entire value chain of manufacturing  EPC and services in the energy sector  and McPhy’s technology and research leadership in this sector”.“McPhy wants to be a global leader in the manufacture of electrolyzers. Joining forces with a major partner like Larsen & Toubro to address new markets is a great opportunity for McPhy and evidence of the attractiveness of its technology”  said Mr. Jean-Baptiste LUCAS  CEO of McPhy.“We are looking forward to an exciting journey where this partnership of L&T and McPhy will play a key role in creating a sustainable energy infrastructure for the future. The GreenHydrogen industry is at a nascent stage with an immense potential  and through this partnership both organizations will harness their inherent strengths to establish cost leadership through local manufacturing and sourcing”  said Mr. Derek M Shah  Sr. Vice President & Head  L&T Energy - Green Mfg. & Development.India is well suited for Green Hydrogen production due to the low generation costs of renewable electricity from abundantly available solar PV and wind power sources. The country aims to be among the world’s largest Green Hydrogen hubs and has grand plans for using the same across the sectors. It can also provide India the energy security by reducing the ever-increasing oil import bill while charting a pathway to green alternatives for “hard-to-abate” industries like refineries  fertilisers  steel  and transport.Green Hydrogen production capacity in India is estimated to grow to at least 5 MMTPA by 2030 in line with the nation’s Green Hydrogen Mission  which would call for investments upward of USD 100 billion.About McPhy:In the framework of the energy transition  and as a leading supplier of hydrogen production and distributionequipment  McPhy contributes to the deployment of low-carbon hydrogen throughout the world.

March 23  2023. The primary and all key secondary endpoints were met in a Phase 3 trial evaluating the investigational use of Dupixent® (dupilumab) compared to placebo in adults currently on maximal standard-of-care inhaled therapy (triple therapy) with uncontrolled chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and evidence of type 2 inflammation. Dupixent is the first and only biologic to demonstrate a clinically meaningful and highly significant reduction (30%) in moderate or severe acute exacerbations of COPD (rapid and acute worsening of respiratory symptoms)  while also demonstrating significant improvements in lung function  quality of life and COPD respiratory symptoms.Dietmar Berger  M.D.  Ph.D.Head of Global R&D ad interim and Chief Medical Officer at Sanofi""Change cannot come quick enough for people living with uncontrolled COPD but  unfortunately  many investigational treatments have failed to demonstrate significant clinical outcomes leaving these vulnerable patients with limited treatment options. We took a bold approach with our direct to Phase 3 program  shaving years off standard clinical development timelines. We are excited to share these unprecedented and potentially paradigm-shifting clinical results  which may give new hope to patients  caregivers and physicians.”Story continuesCOPD is a life-threatening respiratory disease that damages the lungs and causes progressive lung function decline. Symptoms include persistent cough and breathlessness that may not only impair the ability to perform routine daily activities  but can also lead to anxiety  depression and sleep disturbances. COPD is also associated with a significant health and economic burden due to recurrent acute exacerbations that require systemic corticosteroid treatment and/or lead to hospitalization or even death. Smoking is a key risk factor for COPD  but even individuals who quit smoking can still develop the disease. In the U.S. alone  approximately 300 000 people live with uncontrolled COPD with type 2 inflammation.George D. Yancopoulos  M.D.  Ph.D.President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron“COPD is an urgent global health concern and a notoriously difficult-to-treat disease due to its heterogeneity  with no novel treatments approved in more than a decade. In this landmark Phase 3 trial  patients with uncontrolled COPD achieved clinical outcomes with Dupixent at a magnitude never before seen with a biologic. These results also validate the role type 2 inflammation plays in driving COPD in these patients  advancing the scientific community’s understanding of the underlying biology of this disease. We look forward to discussing these exciting results with regulatory authorities.”In the BOREAS Phase 3 trial (the first of two Phase 3 trials)  939 adults who were current or former smokers aged 40 to 80 years were randomized to receive Dupixent (n=468) or placebo (n=471)  added to maximal standard-of-care inhaled therapy. Patients receiving Dupixent experienced:30% reduction in moderate or severe acute COPD exacerbations over 52 weeks (p=0.0005)  the primary endpoint.Improved lung function from baseline by 160 mL at 12 weeks compared to 77 mL for placebo (p<0.0001)  with the benefit versus placebo sustained through week 52 (p=0.0003)  both of which were key secondary endpoints.Dupixent met all endpoints tested in the hierarchy  including improvement in patient-reported health-related quality of life as measured by St. George’s Respiratory Questionaire (SGRQ) and reduction in the severity of respiratory symptoms of COPD as measured by Evaluation Respiratory Symptoms: COPD (E-RS: COPD) Scale.The safety results were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. Overall rates of adverse events (AE) were 77% for Dupixent and 76% for placebo. AEs more commonly observed with Dupixent compared to placebo included headache (8.1% Dupixent  6.8% placebo)  diarrhea (5.3% Dupixent  3.6% placebo) and back pain (5.1% Dupixent  3.4% placebo). AEs more commonly observed with placebo compared to Dupixent included upper respiratory tract infection (9.8% placebo  7.9% Dupixent)  hypertension (6.0% placebo  3.6% Dupixent) and COVID-19 (5.7% placebo  4.1% Dupixent). AEs leading to deaths were balanced between the two arms (1.7% placebo  1.5% Dupixent).Detailed efficacy and safety results from this trial will be presented in a future scientific forum.The broader Sanofi and Regeneron COPD clinical research program includes Phase 3 trials with itepekimab  a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits interleukin-33 (IL-33). Itepekimab received Fast Track Designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in January 2023 for the treatment of COPD in patients who do not currently smoke. Data from this pivotal program is expected in 2025.The safety and efficacy of Dupixent and itepekimab in COPD have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About the Dupixent COPD Phase 3 Trial ProgramBOREAS is one of two pivotal trials in the Dupixent COPD program. The randomized  Phase 3  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in 939 adults who were current or former smokers aged 40 to 80 years with moderate-to-severe COPD. All patients in the trial had evidence of type 2 inflammation  as measured by blood eosinophils ≥300 cells/µL. During the 52-week treatment period  patients received Dupixent or placebo every two weeks  added to triple therapy of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)  long-acting beta agonists  and long-acting muscarinic antagonists. Double maintenance therapy was allowed if ICS was contraindicated.The primary endpoint evaluated the annualized rate of acute moderate or severe COPD exacerbations. Moderate exacerbations were defined as those requiring systemic steroids and/or antibiotics. Severe exacerbations were defined as those: requiring hospitalization; more than a day of observation in an emergency department or urgent care facility; or resulting in death. Key secondary endpoints included change from baseline in lung function (assessed by pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 ) at 12 and 52 weeks; change from baseline at week 52 in SGRQ total score compared to placebo; proportion of patients with SGRQ improvement ≥4 points at week 52; and the change from baseline at 52 weeks in the ERS: COPD Scale symptom scoreThe second  replicate Phase 3 trial of Dupixent in COPD (NOTUS) is ongoing with data expected in 2024.About Sanofi and Regeneron’s COPD Clinical Research ProgramSanofi and Regeneron are motivated to transform the treatment paradigm of COPD by examining the role different types of inflammation play in the disease progression through the investigation of two potentially first-in-class biologics  Dupixent and itepekimab.Dupixent inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and the program focuses on a specific population of people with evidence of type 2 inflammation. Itepekimab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits interleukin-33 (IL-33)  an initiator and amplifier of broad inflammation in COPD. Across both programs  four Phase 3 trials are ongoing and designed to inform next-generation treatments for people with COPD whom might not have other options.About DupixentDupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent  such as atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  prurigo nodularis and eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE).Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP  EoE or prurigo nodularis in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in Europe  the U.S. and Japan. More than 600 000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including pediatric EoE  hand and foot atopic dermatitis  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritus of unknown origin  COPD with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority....About RegeneronRegeneron (NASDAQ: REGN) is a leading biotechnology company that invents  develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

It plans to do this via (i) strengthening of its research focus centered around NKG2D  B7-H6 and shRNA platforms; (ii) maximizing the value of its IP estate and (iii) driving innovation through strategic collaborations.MONT-SAINT-GUIBERT  Belgium  March 23  2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Celyad Oncology (Euronext & Nasdaq: CYAD) (the “Company”)  a biotechnology company focused on innovative technologies for chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies  today announces its financial results for the fiscal year 2022 ended December 31  2022 and provides a business update.Michel Lussier  Interim Chief Executive Officer of Celyad Oncology  said: “2022 was a crossroad year for Celyad Oncology  with important changes and turning points. We strongly believe all those changes  together with our prior accomplishments  significantly strengthened our position. Having dealt with the 2022 challenges  Celyad has now positively reinvented itself as a leaner  more agile organization. We believe that Celyad is well prepared and has the relevant unique assets and know how to create significant shareholder value in the next few years.”Operational highlightsSince late 2022  the Company has implemented a differentiated and innovative strategy  increasing its R&D efforts in areas of expertise where it believes it can leverage the differentiated nature of its platform technology and continue to bolster its intellectual property (IP) estate; andThe Company will continue to explore options to tackle the major current limitations of CAR T-cell therapies through development of its dual targeting CARs with NKG2D capabilities  B7-H6 targeting immunotherapies and multiplexing approach of short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs).Upcoming Anticipated MilestonesThe Company will provide an update on its shRNA multiplexing and dual CAR platforms and business development in the first half of 2023;The Company will take part in the World Oncology Cell Therapy Congress in Boston  US (25-26 April 2023)  as well as in the Immuno-Oncology summit in London (20-22 June 2023);The Company anticipates the arrival of a new CEO in the first half of 2023; andStory continuesWe anticipate fundraising in the first half of 2023.Full Year 2022 Financial ReviewAs of December 31  2022  the Company had cash and cash equivalents of €12.4 million ($13.3 million).The Company projects that its existing cash and cash equivalents should be sufficient to fund operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the fourth quarter of 2023.After due consideration of detailed budgets and estimated cash flow forecasts for the years 2023 and 2024  the Company projects that its existing cash and cash equivalents will not be sufficient to fund its estimated operating and capital expenditures over at least the next 12 months from the date that the financial statements are issued.The Company is currently evaluating different financing options to obtain the required funding to extend the Company’s cash runway beyond 12 months from the date the financial statements are issued.Key financial figures for full-year 2022  compared with full-year 2021  are summarized below:Selected key financial figures (€ millions) Full year 2022 Full year 2021 Revenue - - Research and development expenses (18.9) (20.8) General and administrative expenses (10.5) (9.9) Change in fair value of contingent consideration 14.7 0.8 Impairment of Oncology intangible assets (35.1) - Other income/(expenses) 9.0 3.4 Operating loss (40.9) (26.4) Loss for the period/year (40.9) (26.5) Net cash used in operations (28.0) (26.6) Treasury position(1) 12.4 30.0(1) “Treasury position” is an alternative performance measure determined by adding Short-term investments and Cash and cash equivalents from the statement of financial position prepared in accordance with IFRS. The purpose of this measure by Management is to identify the level of cash available internally (excluding external sources of financing) within 12 months.The Company’s license and collaboration agreements generated no revenue in 2022 and in 2021.Research and Development (R&D) expenses were €18.9 million in 2022 as compared to €20.8 million in 2021  a year-over-year decrease of €1.8 million. The decrease in the Company’s R&D expenses is primarily driven by the Company’s decision to discontinue some of preclinical and in process development costs after the Company’s decision to adopt and implement a new business strategy over the last few months of 2022  as well as a decrease of the expenses associated with share-based payments (non-cash expenses) related to the warrant plan offered to our employees and directors.General and Administrative (G&A) expenses were €10.5 million in 2022 as compared to €9.9 million in 2021  an increase of €0.6 million. This increase is primarily related to higher insurances costs and consulting fees partially compensated by the decrease of the expenses associated with the share-based payments (non-cash expenses) related to the warrants plan offered to our employees and directors.The fair value adjustment (€14.7 million) relating to the contingent consideration and other financial liabilities as of December 31  2022  is mainly driven by the full reversal of the liability. This liability is a result of business combination accounting (IFRS3) which requires the liability to be recorded unless the possibility of any outflow is remote.This impairment comes as a result of the Company’s strategic shift in focus away from clinical development and the early stage nature of the implementation of the Celyad 2.0 strategy  which involves shifting from an organization focused on clinical development to one prioritizing R&D discovery and the monetization of its intellectual property (IP) portfolio through partnerships  collaborations and license agreements. To date  no effective sublicence contract nor collaboration contract has been entered into  and as a result there is uncertainty as to the timing and amount of associated short  medium and long term revenues.Given this uncertainty  and per accounting standards  the Company recognizes a full impairment loss on the remaining value of goodwill  In Process Research and Development  and Horizon Discovery’s shRNA platform  resulting in a non-cash impairment of €35.1 million on a consolidated basis for the financial year ended December 31  2022.This accounting conclusion  which reflects the Company’s financial situation as of December 31  2022  does not affect Management’s commitment to continue in its efforts to pursue the potential monetization of the Company’s IP. If and when such a firm sublicense or collaboration contract occurs and hence increases the probability of revenue  the Management will estimate the reversal of the impairment which will be limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount along with the remeasurement of the related contingent liability.The Company’s other income is principally associated with grants received from the Walloon Region mainly in the form of recoverable cash advances (RCAs) and R&D tax credit income as well as the gain on sale of the CTMU activities:Grant income (RCAs): additional grant income has been recognized in 2022 on grants in the form of RCAs. According to IFRS standards  the Company has earned grants for the period amounting to €1.6 million  out of which €0.5 million is accounted for as a financial liability and the remaining €1.1 million as a grant income;Grant income (Others): additional grant income has been recognized in 2022 on grants received and from the regional government (for €0.9 million)  not referring to RCAs and not subject to reimbursement;With respect to R&D tax credit  the current year income is €0.5 million; andGain on sale of CTMU activities (for €5.2 million) results from the terms of the asset purchase agreement between Celyad Oncology and Cellistic under which Cellistic agreed to acquire Celyad Oncology’s Manufacturing Business Unit for a total consideration of €6.0 million.Net loss for the year ended December 31  2022 was €40.9 million  or €1.81 per share  compared to a net loss of €26.5 million  or €1.70 per share  for the same period in 2021. As noted above  the increase in net loss between periods was primarily due to the non-cash impairment adjustment on the Oncology intangible assets.Net cash used in operations for the year ended December 31  2022  which excludes non-cash effects  amounted to €28.0 million  which is in line with net cash used in operations of €26.6 million for the year ended December 31  2021.The net assets of the Company as of December 31  2022  on a BE-GAAP non-consolidated basis  have fallen below half of the Company’s capital. As a result  in accordance with Article 7:228 of the Belgian Code for Companies and Associations  the Board of Directors plans to submit for a vote  at its May 5  2023 shareholders’ meeting  its business plan including a proposal to continue the Company’s activities. The Board of Directors will publish a detailed report regarding this proposal on or around April 3  2023  together with the convocation with proposed resolutions for the shareholders’ meeting.Annual Report 2022The Annual Report for the year ended December 31  2022 will be published on March 23  2023  and will be available on the Company’s website  www.celyad.com.

Those decisions  he says  are swaying prospects that are viewing digital in the context of cost per loan—as well as evidence of ROI  key to helping lenders sell these projects to their management.“At the end of the day  institutions know that eClosings and eNotes are the future. I think the painful experience of downsizing has probably convinced them that when the next cycle comes  they will need to scale to meet it using technology and not by another hiring boom ” Wilzbach says. “Just as importantly  we must recognize that the move to digital lending is a journey  not a sprint. While a full  digital mortgage closing with an eNote may be the ultimate goal of lenders  providers must recognize that not all lenders are closing in the same way today.”He points to a recent snapshot survey conducted by Wolters Kluwer in which 138 lenders were asked why they weren’t fully digital. While 15% of respondents cited budget concerns  more than 60% said they hadn’t found the right solution  the right provider or they weren’t sure of the value.“Simplifying the closing process through electronic signing  in general and in pre-signing specific documents in advance of the formal closing  is critical to an enhanced customer experience ” Wilzbach concludes.About Wolters KluwerWolters Kluwer (EURONEXT: WKL) is a global leader in professional information  software solutions  and services for the healthcare  tax and accounting  financial and corporate compliance  legal and regulatory  and corporate performance and ESG sectors.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced the primary and all key secondary endpoints were met in a Phase 3 trial evaluating the investigational use of Dupixent® (dupilumab) compared to placebo in adults currently on maximal standard-of-care inhaled therapy (triple therapy) with uncontrolled chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and evidence of type 2 inflammation. Dupixent is the first and only biologic to demonstrate a clinically meaningful and highly significant reduction (30%) in moderate or severe acute exacerbations of COPD (rapid and acute worsening of respiratory symptoms) over 52 weeks  while also demonstrating significant improvements in lung function  quality of life and COPD respiratory symptoms.“COPD is an urgent global health concern and a notoriously difficult-to-treat disease due to its heterogeneity  with no novel treatments approved in more than a decade ” said George D. Yancopoulos  M.D.  Ph.D.  President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron  and a principal inventor of Dupixent. “In this landmark Phase 3 trial  patients with uncontrolled COPD achieved clinical outcomes with Dupixent at a magnitude never before seen with a biologic. These results also validate the role type 2 inflammation plays in driving COPD in these patients  advancing the scientific community’s understanding of the underlying biology of this disease. We look forward to discussing these exciting results with regulatory authorities.”Story continuesCOPD is a life-threatening respiratory disease that damages the lungs and causes progressive lung function decline. Symptoms include persistent cough and breathlessness that may not only impair the ability to perform routine daily activities  but can also lead to anxiety  depression and sleep disturbances. COPD is also associated with a significant health and economic burden due to recurrent acute exacerbations that require systemic corticosteroid treatment and/or lead to hospitalization or even death. Smoking is a key risk factor for COPD  but even individuals who quit smoking can still develop the disease. In the U.S. alone  approximately 300 000 people live with uncontrolled COPD with type 2 inflammation.“Change cannot come quick enough for people living with uncontrolled COPD  but unfortunately  many investigational treatments have failed to demonstrate significant clinical outcomes leaving these vulnerable patients with limited treatment options. We took a bold approach with our direct to Phase 3 program  shaving years off standard clinical development timelines ” said Dietmar Berger  M.D.  Ph.D.  Head of Global R&D ad interim at Sanofi and Chief Medical Officer. “We are excited to share these unprecedented and potentially paradigm-shifting clinical results  which may give new hope to patients  caregivers and physicians.”In the BOREAS trial (the first of two Phase 3 trials)  939 adults who were current or former smokers aged 40 to 80 years were randomized to receive Dupixent (n=468) or placebo (n=471) added to maximal standard-of-care inhaled therapy. Patients receiving Dupixent experienced:30% reduction in moderate or severe acute COPD exacerbations over 52 weeks (p=0.0005)  the primary endpoint.Improved lung function from baseline by 160 mL at 12 weeks compared to 77 mL for placebo (p<0.0001)  with the benefit versus placebo sustained through week 52 (p=0.0003)  both of which were key secondary endpoints.Dupixent met all endpoints tested in the hierarchy  including improvement in patient-reported health-related quality of life as measured by the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and reduction in the severity of respiratory symptoms of COPD as measured by Evaluation Respiratory Symptoms: COPD (E-RS: COPD) Scale.The safety results were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. Overall rates of adverse events (AEs) were 77% for Dupixent and 76% for placebo. AEs more commonly observed with Dupixent compared to placebo included headache (8.1% Dupixent  6.8% placebo)  diarrhea (5.3% Dupixent  3.6% placebo) and back pain (5.1% Dupixent  3.4% placebo). AEs more commonly observed with placebo compared to Dupixent included upper respiratory tract infection (9.8% placebo  7.9% Dupixent)  hypertension (6.0% placebo  3.6% Dupixent) and COVID-19 (5.7% placebo  4.1% Dupixent). AEs leading to deaths were balanced between the two arms (1.7% placebo  1.5% Dupixent).Detailed efficacy and safety results from this trial will be presented in a future scientific forum.The broader Sanofi and Regeneron COPD clinical research program includes Phase 3 trials with itepekimab  a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits interleukin-33 (IL-33). Itepekimab received Fast Track Designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in January 2023 for the treatment of COPD in patients who do not currently smoke. Data from this pivotal program is expected in 2025.The safety and efficacy of Dupixent and itepekimab in COPD have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About the Dupixent COPD Phase 3 Trial ProgramBOREAS is one of two pivotal trials in the Dupixent COPD program. The randomized  Phase 3  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in 939 adults who were current or former smokers aged 40 to 80 years with moderate-to-severe COPD. All patients in the trial had evidence of type 2 inflammation  as measured by blood eosinophils ≥300 cells/µL. During the 52-week treatment period  patients received Dupixent or placebo every two weeks added to a triple therapy of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)  long-acting beta agonists  and long-acting muscarinic antagonists. Double maintenance therapy was allowed if ICS was contraindicated.The primary endpoint evaluated the annualized rate of acute moderate or severe COPD exacerbations. Moderate exacerbations were defined as those requiring systemic steroids and/or antibiotics. Severe exacerbations were defined as those: requiring hospitalization; more than a day of observation in an emergency department or urgent care facility; or resulting in death. Key secondary endpoints included: change from baseline in lung function (assessed by pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume [FEV 1 ]) at 12 and 52 weeks; change from baseline at 52 weeks in SGRQ total score compared to placebo; the proportion of patients with SGRQ improvement ≥4 points at 52 weeks; and the change from baseline at 52 weeks in the ERS: COPD Scale symptom score.The second  replicate Phase 3 trial of Dupixent in COPD (NOTUS) is ongoing with data expected in 2024.About Regeneron and Sanofi’s COPD Clinical Research ProgramRegeneron and Sanofi are motivated to transform the treatment paradigm of COPD by examining the role different types of inflammation play in the disease progression through the investigation of two potentially first-in-class biologics  Dupixent and itepekimab.Dupixent inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and the program focuses on a specific population of people with evidence of type 2 inflammation. Itepekimab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits interleukin-33 (IL-33)  an initiator and amplifier of broad inflammation in COPD. Across both programs  four Phase 3 trials are ongoing and designed to inform next-generation treatments for people with COPD who might not have other options.About DupixentDupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent  such as atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) and prurigo nodularis.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP  EoE or prurigo nodularis in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in Europe  the U.S. and Japan. More than 600 000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create a substantial proportion of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Dupixent  Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent® (alirocumab)  Kevzara® (sarilumab)  Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb® (atoltivimab  maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including pediatric EoE  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritus of unknown origin  COPD with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. INDICATIONSDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe eczema (atopic dermatitis or AD) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies.

The French firm has invited investment banks to pitch for its business. Photograph: Nathan Laine/BloombergRenault is inviting investment banks to pitch for a role on the planned initial public offering of its Ampere electric-vehicle business  according to people familiar with the matter.The French carmaker has been sending out requests for proposals to potential IPO underwriters in recent days  the people said  asking not to be identified because the information is private. It’s considering listing Ampere on the Euronext Paris bourse as soon as the fourth quarter  the people said.Renault  which makes Megane E-Tech hatchbacks and Alpine sports cars  has been aiming for a valuation of roughly €10 billion for Ampere. Deliberations are ongoing  and details of the potential offering could change due to market conditions  the people said.A spokesman for Renault declined to comment.READ MOREThe company  which has been carving out its EV assets  this month announced internally around 15 in-house managers will be tasked with moving the Ampere project forward under the leadership of chief executive officer Luca de Meo.Renault is moving ahead with a sweeping overhaul to raise funds for EV development and narrow the gap with bigger rivals such as Stellantis. Japanese partner Nissan has pledged to buy as much as 15 per cent of Ampere and Mitsubishi Motors is considering an investment. Qualcomm  the largest maker of smartphone processors  will also back the business.Europe has been facing a drought of major IPOs amid volatile stocks and a bleak economic outlook. The sudden meltdown of Credit Suisse  which ignited a global market rout  has been adding to investor jitters this month. Just about $2 billion has been raised via new listings on European exchanges so far this year  a near 50 per cent drop from the same period last year.“Investor appetite for pure-play EV stories has come down in recent months putting some pressure on management to explain how the Ampere investment case differs ” Jefferies International Limited analyst Philippe Houchois wrote in a March 20 note. “Deeper co-operation with Qualcomm and Google should help Renault catch-up or leapfrog some larger competitors with lower execution risk and intuitive software solutions.”The carmaker’s approach is “unique so far in ring-fencing future battery-electric-vehicle product development and manufacturing capabilities ” Houchois also wrote.Even though companies are having difficulty picking the right time to list  the pipeline for IPOs remains strong  stock exchange operator Euronext said last month.The stock was trading 0.6 per cent lower in Paris on Thursday. Renault shares are up 60 per cent in the past year  giving the company a market value of €10.9 billion. – Bloomberg,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.12,0.12,0.76,True,English,"['The Irish Times', 'bank pitches', 'EV arm', 'Renault', 'Jefferies International Limited analyst Philippe Houchois', 'ring-fencing future battery-electric-vehicle product development', 'electric concept vehicle', 'Alpine sports cars', 'chief executive officer', 'Luca de Meo', 'lower execution risk', 'intuitive software solutions', 'initial public offering', 'potential IPO underwriters', 'Paris Motor Show', 'global market rout', 'pure-play EV stories', '50 per cent drop', 'stock exchange operator', 'Renault 4Ever Trophy', 'Euronext Paris bourse', 'Ampere investment case', 'Ampere electric-vehicle business', 'EV development', 'potential offering', '15 per cent', 'market conditions', 'EV assets', 'market value', 'opening day', 'French firm', 'investment banks', 'Nathan Laine/Bloomberg', 'recent days', 'fourth quarter', 'Tech hatchbacks', 'house managers', 'sweeping overhaul', 'bigger rivals', 'Japanese partner', 'Mitsubishi Motors', 'largest maker', 'smartphone processors', 'volatile stocks', 'economic outlook', 'sudden meltdown', 'Credit Suisse', 'investor jitters', 'new listings', 'European exchanges', 'same period', 'Investor appetite', 'recent months', 'March 20 note', 'Deeper co', 'larger competitors', 'manufacturing capabilities', 'right time', 'past year', 'Ampere project', 'French carmaker', 'major IPOs', 'Renault shares', 'unveiling', 'October', 'Photograph', 'role', 'people', 'matter', 'requests', 'proposals', 'information', 'Megane', 'Deliberations', 'details', 'spokesman', 'READ', 'company', 'leadership', 'funds', 'gap', 'Stellantis', 'Nissan', 'Qualcomm', 'drought', 'pressure', 'management', 'operation', 'Google', 'approach', 'companies', 'difficulty', 'pipeline', 'Thursday']",2023-03-23,2023-03-24,irishtimes.com

The study was managed by the company Vitaccess in collaboration with patient advocacy groups and key opinion leaders in the field  with the support of Pharnext.More information about the CMT&Me study on https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/showithNCT03782883.About Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease Type 1A (‘CMT1A')Charcot-Marie-Tooth (‘CMT') disease encompasses a heterogeneous group of inherited  severe  debilitating  progressive and chronic peripheral neuropathies. CMT1A  the most common type of CMT  is an orphan disease with a prevalence of 1/5000 people affecting about 150 000 people in Europe and the U.S. and about 1 500 000 people worldwide. The genetic mutation responsible for CMT1A is a duplication of the PMP22 gene coding for a peripheral myelin protein. The duplication of this gene results in overexpression of the PMP22 protein and failure of Schwann cells to produce normal myelin (neuronal sheath). The lack of a normal myelin structure and function leads to abnormal peripheral nerve conduction and axonal loss. As a result of peripheral nerve degradation  patients suffer from progressive muscle atrophy in both the legs and arms causing problems with walking  running and balance as well as abnormal hand functioning. They might also suffer from mild to moderate sensory disorders. First symptoms usually appear during adolescence and will progressively evolve throughout life. Patients with the most severe form of CMT1A end up in wheelchairs  representing at least 5% of cases. To date  no curative or symptomatic medications have been approved and treatment consists of supportive care such as orthotics  leg braces  physical and occupational therapy or surgery. More information can be found at https://pharnext.com/en/disease/charcot-marie-tooth.About PharnextPharnext is an advanced clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapies for neurodegenerative diseases currently without satisfactory therapeutic solutions. Pharnext has a first-in-class drug candidate  PXT3003  in development for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A)  a rare  debilitating  inherited peripheral neuropathy. PXT3003 benefits from orphan drug status in Europe and the United States. In 2018  PXT3003 completed a Phase III clinical trial  the PLEO-CMT trial  with encouraging topline results. This trial was followed by an open-label extension study  the PLEO-CMT-FU trial  with 120 patients continuing treatment with PXT3003. Long-term data suggest a sustained benefit  safety  and efficacy  after 5 years of total trial time.

The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) issued an epidemiological alert last month as the number of cases and deaths due to chikungunya continues to rise in the Americas5. With no preventive vaccine or specific treatment yet available  chikungunya is considered a major public health threat.Valneva announced last month that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted the filing of a Biologics License Application (BLA)6 for approval of VLA1553 in persons aged 18 years and above and granted priority review for the application7. Under this priority review  VLA1553 has currently been assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) review goal date at the end of August 2023  which is the date by which the FDA intends to take action on the application subject to progress of the BLA review. VLA1553 is currently the only chikungunya vaccine candidate worldwide for which a regulatory review process is underway8 and  if approved  it could become the first chikungunya vaccine available to address this unmet medical need.Valneva’s BLA application follows final pivotal Phase 3 data in March 20229  final lot-to-lot consistency results in May 202210 and positive twelve-month persistence data in December 202211. A clinical study of VLA1553 in adolescents is ongoing in Brazil12  for which Valneva reported enrollment and vaccination completion in February 202313. This trial  conducted by Valneva’s partner Instituto Butantan and funded by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI)  may support future regulatory submissions in this age group  if VLA1553 is initially approved in adults  as well as licensure of the vaccine in Europe and Brazil  which would be the first potential approval for use in an endemic population. Topline results are expected mid-2023.The program received FDA Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy designations in 2018 and 2021  respectively. VLA1553 was also granted PRIority MEdicine (PRIME) designation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2020. Valneva currently plans to make additional regulatory submissions for VLA1553 in the second half of 2023. The sponsor of the first chikungunya vaccine approved in the U.S. is eligible to receive a Priority Review Voucher (PRV)14.LYME DISEASE VACCINE CANDIDATE – VLA15Phase 3 study initiatedValneva and Pfizer are developing VLA15  a Lyme disease vaccine candidate that targets the outer surface protein A (OspA) of Borrelia burgdorferi  the bacterium that causes Lyme disease. VLA15 is a multivalent recombinant protein vaccine that targets six serotypes of Borrelia representing the most common strains found in North America and Europe. VLA15 is the only Lyme disease vaccine program in advanced clinical development today and has received Fast Track designation from the FDA.Valneva and Pfizer reported results for three Phase 2 clinical trials of VLA15 in both adult and pediatric populations  in which high levels of antibodies against all six strains were observed15 16 17. In August 2022  the companies initiated a Phase 3 clinical study  ""Vaccine Against Lyme for Outdoor Recreationists (VALOR)""  to investigate the efficacy  safety and immunogenicity of VLA15 in participants five years of age and older in highly endemic regions in the United States and Europe18.In February 2023  Pfizer  as the study sponsor  decided to discontinue half of the total enrolled participants in the trial following violations of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) at certain clinical trial sites run by a third-party clinical trial site operator19. The clinical trial remains ongoing at sites not operated by the third party. The companies intend to work with regulatory authorities and  as previously announced  aim for Pfizer to potentially maintain the original submission timelines  pending successful completion of the Phase 3 studies and subject to the agreement of these regulatory agencies to proposed modifications of the clinical trial plan.According to the terms of Valneva’s collaboration with Pfizer  Pfizer leads late phase development of VLA15 and  if approved  Pfizer will have sole control over its commercialization with Valneva eligible to receive up to $408 million in milestones  plus royalty payments. In June 2022  the terms of this collaboration were updated  and Pfizer invested €90.5 ($95) million in Valneva as part of an equity subscription agreement20. As per the terms of the collaboration agreement  Valneva received a $25 million milestone payment from Pfizer in 2022 following initiation of the Phase 3 study.Pre-Clinical Vaccine CandidatesValneva continues to progress select pre-clinical assets and focus on strengthening its future clinical pipeline. The Company is currently focused on VLA2112  a vaccine candidate targeting the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)  which is one of the most common human viruses. EBV can cause infectious mononucleosis21 and is strongly associated with the development of several types of cancer22 and multiple sclerosis23. Valneva has also been working on a vaccine candidate targeting the human metapneumovirus (hMPV)  which is a major worldwide respiratory pathogen that causes acute upper and lower respiratory tract infection24 and is currently exploring potential partnering opportunities. Additionally  Valneva initiated pre-clinical work on vaccine candidates targeting parvovirus B19  a virus most commonly causing fifth disease25  and Campylobacter  a bacterium often associated with food poisoning26.Commercial VaccinesJAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS VACCINE (IXIARO®/JESPECT®)IXIARO® is an inactivated Vero cell culture-derived Japanese encephalitis that is the only Japanese encephalitis vaccine licensed and available in the United States  Canada and Europe. IXIARO® is indicated for active immunization against Japanese encephalitis  the most prevalent cause of viral encephalitis in Asia  for adults  adolescents  children and infants aged two months and older.IXIARO®/JESPECT® sales were €41.3 million in 2022 compared to €45.1 million in 2021. This decrease was the result of lower sales to the U.S. Department of Defense. The significant recovery of the private travel markets partly offset this impact  with IXIARO®/JESPECT® private sales reaching €28.8 million in 2022 compared to €7.1 million in 2021.CHOLERA / ETEC27-DIARRHEA VACCINE (DUKORAL®)DUKORAL® is an oral vaccine for the prevention of diarrhea caused by Vibrio cholerae and/or heat-labile toxin producing ETEC28  the leading cause of travelers’ diarrhea. DUKORAL® is authorized for use in the European Union and Australia to protect against cholera  and in Canada  Switzerland  New Zealand and Thailand to protect against cholera and ETEC.DUKORAL® sales increased to €17.3 million in 2022 compared to €2.4 million in 2021  also benefitting from the significant recovery in the private travel markets.SARS-CoV-2 INACTIVATED WHOLE-VIRUS VACCINEValneva’s COVID-19 vaccine  VLA2001  is the only inactivated whole-virus COVID-19 vaccine approved in Europe29 and was the first COVID-19 vaccine to receive a full marketing authorization from the EMA. In addition to its marketing approval in Europe  Valneva’s COVID-19 vaccine received conditional marketing authorization in the United Kingdom30 and emergency use authorization in the United Arab Emirates31 and the Kingdom of Bahrain32. In 2022  sales of VLA2001 to the Kingdom of Bahrain and certain EU Member States amounted to €29.6 million. Valneva will provide additional doses to the Kingdom of Bahrain in 2023 pursuant to the advance purchase agreement signed in December 2021.In July 2022  Valneva entered into an amendment to the purchase agreement originally entered into in November 2021 with the European Commission.33 In light of the reduced order volume of 1.25 million doses  which were delivered to Germany  Austria  Denmark  Finland  and Bulgaria in 2022  Valneva suspended manufacturing of the vaccine in August 2022 and has been reshaping the Company to increase efficiency and focus on its operational and strategic business objectives. The Company is continuing to explore potential additional supply agreements to deploy the remaining eight to ten million doses of inventory. However  these inventories were fully written down as of December 31  2022. Earlier this month  Valneva provided clinical and regulatory updates for VLA200134. VLA2001’s shelf life was notably extended to 21 months compared to 18 months previously. The Company will continue to submit data to further extend it.THIRD-PARTY DISTRIBUTIONValneva distributes certain third-party vaccines in countries where it operates its own marketing and sales infrastructure. In September 2022  Valneva announced a partnership with VBI Vaccines for the marketing and distribution of the only 3-antigen Hepatitis B vaccine  PreHevbri®  in select European markets35.In 2022  Valneva’s third party product sales increased by 72.1% to €26.5 million from €15.4 million in 2021.Full Year 2022 Financial Review(Audited36  consolidated under IFRS)RevenuesValneva’s total revenues were €361.3 million in 2022 compared to €348.1 million in 2021  an increase of 3.8%.Valneva’s total product sales reached €114.8 million in 2022 compared to €63.0 million in 2021  an increase of 82.3%. This was driven by a continued recovery of travel vaccine sales that surpassed expectations (€85.2 million versus guidance of €70 to €80 million) complemented by COVID-19 vaccine sales in Europe and Bahrain (€29.6 million). On a constant exchange rate (CER) basis  product sales increased by 66.7% in 2022 as compared to 2021.IXIARO®/JESPECT® sales were €41.3 million in 2022 compared to €45.1 million in 2021  a decrease of 8.4% (18.6% at CER)  driven by lower sales to the U.S. Department of Defense. This decrease was partly offset by the significant recovery of the private travel markets  with IXIARO®/JESPECT® private sales reaching €28.8 million in 2022 compared to €7.1 million in 2021.DUKORAL® sales were €17.3 million in 2022 compared to €2.4 million in 2021  an increase of 610.3% (629.2% at CER)  also benefitting from the significant recovery in the private travel markets.Third-party product sales grew to €26.5 million in 2022 compared to €15.4 million in 2021  an increase of 72.1%. This increase was primarily due to the marketing and distribution partnership with Bavarian Nordic.Other Revenues  including revenues from collaborations  licensing and services  amounted to €246.5 million in 2022 compared to €285.1 million in 2021. These were mainly driven by revenue recognition related to previous COVID-19 vaccine supply agreements.Operating Result and adjusted EBITDACosts of goods and services sold (COGS) were €324.4 million in 2022. The gross margin on commercial product sales amounted to 45.5% compared to 36.5% in 2021. COGS of €15.6 million related to IXIARO® product sales  yielding a product gross margin of 62.2%. COGS of €14.2 million related to DUKORAL® product sales  yielding a product gross margin of 18.2%. The DUKORAL® gross margin was impacted by €8.3 million of impairment charges for Valneva Sweden’s manufacturing facilities following suspension of the COVID-19 vaccine fill and finish activities at that site. Of the remaining COGS in 2022  €16.7 million related to the third-party products distribution business  €267.1 million to the COVID-19 vaccine business and €9.7 million to cost of services. COGS of the COVID-19 vaccine program included effects from the significant reduction of sales volumes to the European Union Member States which resulted in impairment of fixed assets and inventories. In 2021  overall COGS were €187.9 million  of which €162.9 million related to cost of goods and €25.1 million related to cost of services. Research and development expenses amounted to €104.9 million in 2022  compared to €173.3 million in 2021. This decrease was mainly driven by lower clinical trial costs for Valneva’s chikungunya vaccine program advancing towards licensure as well as reduced spend on the COVID-19 program. Marketing and distribution expenses in 2022 amounted to €23.5 million compared to €23.6 million in 2021. Marketing and distribution expenses in 2022 notably included €7.3 million of expenses related to launch preparation costs for Valneva’s chikungunya vaccine candidate  VLA1553  compared to €3.8 million in 2021. In 2022  general and administrative expenses declined to €34.1 million from €47.6 million in 2021. COGS  research and development  marketing and distribution as well as general and administrative expenses benefited from a non-cash accrual adjustment related to the positive effect of the Company’s share price development on employee share-based compensation programs. This income compares to an expense in 2021.Other income  net of other expenses  reduced to €12.2 million in 2022 from €23.0 million in 2021. This decrease was mainly driven by reduced R&D tax credits directly resulting from lower R&D spending and an increase of other expenses related to the provision for the ongoing Vivalis/Intercell merger litigation proceedings.Valneva recorded an operating loss of €113.4 million in 2022 compared to an operating loss of €61.4 million in 2021  of which the COVID-19 program contributed a loss of €42.8 million in 2022 and a profit of €3.9 million in 2021. The other segments represented an operating loss of €70.6 million in 2022 compared to an operating loss of €65.3 million in 2021. Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below) loss in 2022 was €69.2 million compared to an adjusted EBITDA loss of €47.1 million in 2021.Net ResultIn 2022  Valneva generated a net loss of €143.3 million compared to a net loss of €73.4 million in 2021.Finance expense and foreign currency effects in 2022 resulted in a net finance expense of €31.4 million  compared to a net finance expense of €8.6 million in 2021. This was mainly a result of a foreign exchange loss amounting to €12.6 million in 2022  primarily driven by non-cash revaluation results of non-Euro denominated balance sheet positions  compared to a net foreign exchange gain of €8.1 million in 2021. Interest expenses net of interest income were €18.8 million in 2022 compared to €16.7 million in 2021.Cash Flow and LiquidityNet cash used in operating activities amounted to €245.3 million in 2022 compared to €76.9 million of cash generated by operating activities in 2021. Cash outflows in 2022 were mainly related to the operating loss generated in the period and non-cash revenues (cash received in previous periods)  while during 2021 cash inflows mainly resulted from pre-payments received under the vaccine supply agreement signed with the UK government.Cash outflows from investing activities amounted to €29.1 million in 2022 compared to €93.1 million in 2021  both mainly a result of COVID-19-related construction activities across production sites in Scotland and Sweden  as well as equipment purchases.Net cash generated from financing activities amounted to €215.1 million in 2022  which was mainly a result of proceeds from the equity subscription agreement with Pfizer  proceeds from a global offering as well as a draw-down of the credit facility provided by Deerfield Management Company & OrbiMed37. Cash inflows in 2021 amounted to €154.5 million which was mainly a result of proceeds from issuance of new shares in the U.S. initial public offering and European private placement in May as well as an additional global offering in November 2021.Cash and cash equivalents amounted to €289.4 million as at December 31  2022  compared to €346.7 million as at December 31  2021. This included €102.9 million of gross proceeds from an upsized global offering completed in October 2022  €90.5 ($95) million from an equity investment by Pfizer completed in June 2022 as well as drawing of a total $40 million from the Deerfield Management Company & OrbiMed loan agreement.Non-IFRS Financial MeasuresManagement uses and presents IFRS results  as well as the non-IFRS measure of Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate and communicate its performance. While non-IFRS measures should not be construed as alternatives to IFRS measures  management believes non-IFRS measures are useful to further understand Valneva’s current performance  performance trends  and financial condition.Adjusted EBITDA is a common supplemental measure of performance used by investors and financial analysts. Management believes this measure provides additional analytical tools. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings (loss) for the period before income tax  finance income/expense  foreign exchange gain/(loss)  results from investments in associates  amortization  depreciation  and impairment.A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss for the period  which is the most directly comparable IFRS measure  is set forth below:€ in million Twelve months ending December 31 (consolidated per IFRS) 2022 2021 Loss for the period (143.3) (73.4) Add: Income tax expense (1.5) 3.4 Total Finance income (0.3) (0.2) Total Finance expense 19.1 17.0 Foreign exchange gain/(loss) – net 12.6 (8.1) Result from investments in associates - - Amortization 7.0 6.6 Depreciation 14.0 7.7 Impairment 23.2 - Adjusted EBITDA (69.2) (47.1)About Valneva SEValneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development  manufacturing and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need.

Full-year turnover was €25.2 million  up 8.7% overall and up 14.8% excluding Russia.Momentum remained strong among small and medium-sized companies  with sales activity from the partner network rising sharply. Conversely  key accounts remained cautious and were hampered by a shortage of labor  which slowed the deployment of their cybersecurity projects. Overall  the pace of contract acquisition remained brisk  with a 20% increase in the number of active contracts. At December 31  2022  the Group had a portfolio of nearly 2 300 active contracts.In 2022  monthly recurring revenue (MRR) totaled €1.2 million  up 21.7% versus 2021  representing €14.8 million in recurring business on an annual basis. WALLIX accordingly starts 2023 with annual recurring revenue accounting for 58.9% of 2022 consolidated turnover. This represents an increase of 6.3 percentage points from 52.6% in 2021.Investment plan under controlThe investment phase of the UNICORN 25 plan was focused on 2022 and resulted in a 17% increase in operating expenses to €33.9 million. The ratio of operating expenses[2] to turnover is slightly better than in the investment phases of the previous plans initiated in 2015 and 2018 (1.35 versus 1.41 under the Ambition plan and 1.43 under the IPO plan)  despite business being hampered by the geopolitical environment in the first half.The dynamic recruitment drive  particularly in North America  was focused on the second half and resulted in a 13.8% increase in payroll over the year. WALLIX GROUP had an average of 233 employees in 2022  versus 204 in 2021. Other operating expenses surged 26% as a result of particularly buoyant sales and marketing development  which will help boost the Group's growth  the strengthening of client support  the launch of two flagship solutions  WALLIX PAM4ALL and OT.security  and lastly  the consolidation of the organization to support future growth. As a result  the Group posted an operating loss of €7.1 million  versus a €2.2 million loss in 2021. Adjusting for the accounting treatment of the research tax credit (CIR) in accordance with the method applied until the end of 2021  the adjusted operating loss was €6.4 million  with a significant improvement between the first half (€4.0 million loss) and the second half (€2.5 million loss).Net loss Group share amounted to €6.0 million.Cash and cash equivalents of €14 million covering the organic plan financing requirementsAgainst the backdrop of accelerated expenditure necessary for the proper execution of the new strategic plan  and with a first half slowed by the conflict in Ukraine  operating cash flow amounted to a €2.3 million outflow. Cash flows from investing activities  primarily related to capitalized development costs  amounted to a €5.8 million outflow. As a result  free cash flow amounted to a €8.1 million outflow.As of December 31  2022  gross cash and cash equivalents amounted to €13.6 million  versus €22.7 million as of December 31  2021. With net cash and cash equivalents of €11.5 million and shareholders' equity of €17.5 million  the Group's financial capacity is in line with the organic requirements of the strategic plan.2023 roadmap: leverage existing assets and increase the value proposition for clients2022 was a key phase of the UNICORN 25 plan  during which the Group focused on establishing and strengthening the four pillars of its future growth:By offering an end-to-end solution : the Group has developed a concept called “PAM for all” with the launch of WALLIX PAM4ALL  a comprehensive solution that combines all WALLIX technologies to ensure a secure digital transformation for all organizations and users. This offer has enabled the Group to position itself among the global PAM leaders by entering the PAM Leader category of the Gartner Magic Quadrant ranking compiled by one of the world's most prestigious consulting firms;: the Group has developed a concept called “PAM for all” with the launch of WALLIX PAM4ALL  a comprehensive solution that combines all WALLIX technologies to ensure a secure digital transformation for all organizations and users. This offer has enabled the Group to position itself among the global PAM leaders by entering the PAM Leader category of the Gartner Magic Quadrant ranking compiled by one of the world's most prestigious consulting firms; By consolidating its leadership in Europe   with a focus on SMEs  “critical” sectors and industrial environments;  with a focus on SMEs  “critical” sectors and industrial environments; By conquering the North American market : in accordance with the announced plan  WALLIX has significantly strengthened its assets in the North American market with the recruitment of a sales team and the creation of one Channel per region  which now has nearly 30 partners. North America is a strategic priority and is expected to account for 10% of order intake in 2023;: in accordance with the announced plan  WALLIX has significantly strengthened its assets in the North American market with the recruitment of a sales team and the creation of one Channel per region  which now has nearly 30 partners. North America is a strategic priority and is expected to account for 10% of order intake in 2023; By positioning itself in the industrial cybersecurity market: WALLIX has launched OT.security  a comprehensive offer that provides both access and identity security for industrial companies via its PAM4OT solution and “by design” security for industrial engineering players via its WALLIX Inside solution. By 2023  WALLIX aims to derive 10% of its order intake from this market segment  which is expected to grow by more than 30% per year to reach €320 million in 2025.With these markers in place  the 2023 roadmap aims to make existing assets profitable and to increase growth. The Group plans to leverage its network of over 300 partners by strengthening their support in order to maximize sales of its flagship product WALLIX PAM4ALL and its OT.security solution by offering them the chance to increase their skills in industrial cybersecurity  targeting small and medium-sized companies and “critical” sectors.Innovation and an enhanced offering also form an integral part of the Group's 2023 roadmap  through both internal and external growth. The strategy is to continue to develop and enrich solutions by adding complementary technological building blocks  but also to develop expertise and talents to ensure the future growth of WALLIX.WALLIX is looking into various acquisition opportunities in France that would bring complementary technologies to WALLIX PAM4ALL  including IAG (Identity and Access Governance)  which reduces risk thanks to an identity-based approach  access rights mapping and detection of risky or suspicious authorizations. The aim is to improve the user experience and achieve broader coverage of the Identity and Access Management (IAM) market. This external growth strategy  which is perfectly in line with the UNICORN 25 plan  is also aimed at the industrial cybersecurity market  where WALLIX stands out  according to Gartner  as one of the few players to have developed PAM solutions specifically dedicated to the OT environment. As such  the Group is seeking to strengthen its talent base so as to seize the growth opportunities offered by this segment through its OT.security solution. Priority is being given to profitable start-ups and SMEs that can have a rapid impact on Group prospects.After a return to sustained growth in the second half of 2022  the Group expects organic growth to increase in 2023. With capital expenditure largely completed during 2022  the ramp-up will come with a significant improvement in earnings as operating expenses gradually return to normal. By pursuing this trajectory  the WALLIX Group expects to break even at operating level in 2024.Next publication: H1 2023 turnover  July 20  2023ABOUT WALLIXWALLIX is the European specialist in access and digital identity security and the world leader in PAM (Privileged Access Management).

This organic growth was supported by a continuous optimization of selling prices through new ""Power Purchase Agreements"" in an energy price market that remains favourable.The Group thus recorded revenues of €21.3 million over the half-year  up by 134% compared to H1 2022. The contribution of Cryo Pur over these first 6 months was €562K.This performance was enhanced by continued cost control in an inflationary context  with cost of goods and services representing 11% of revenues (H1 2022: 28%) and administrative expenses (excluding Cryo Pur and IFRS accounting of awarded employees free shares) stable at €2.1 million during this half-year.EBITDA was therefore multiplied by close to 3 and reached €15.8 million in H1 2022 (H1: 5.7 M€). The EBITDA margin (including Cryo Pur) increased to 74%  beyond the Group's margin objectives at the end of 2026.The Operating Income recorded a spectacular growth  rising from €4.8 million in H1 2022 to 14.6 M€ over this semester (being 68% of the revenues)  thus exceeding the annual Operating Income of the financial year ended June 30th  2022.With lower financial charges and estimated tax charge for the half-year of €3.8 million  net income  Group share amounted to €10.4 million in H1 2022  compared to €2.6 million at December 31st  2021.This good business momentum will continue throughout the second half of FY 2023 with the contribution of the 15 operational cogeneration units and the production of green electricity from the group's first photovoltaic project (15 MW)  fully effective since January 2023. In addition  more than 70% of the cogeneration portfolio in France and Belgium is now valued under PPAs  of which 60% of the prices have been fixed at more than €200/MWH (without cap on the selling price) for the rest of 2023.Solid financial structure to support the Group's developmentsOver the half-year  FDE confirms its ability to generate strong positive operating cash flow of €15.5 million (before change in WCR of 5.7 M€) and saw its cash position strengthened through a €20 million second tranche of its green bond debt for the development of its low-carbon energy portfolio (and in particular Cryo Pur). As of December 31st  2022  €5 million has been drawn down and enabled the Group to limit the use of its equity and optimize the cost of its capital  especially in this rising interest rates environment.The Group therefore recorded a cash balance of €26.6 million(+€2.7 million compared to June 30th  2022) and a net debt to equity ratio of 42%  a reduced level compared to the previous period  allowing nevertheless FDE to steadily finance its growth strategy.Ongoing developments across the Group's portfolioOver H1 2023  the Group has continued its sustained investment policy  with investments cash out of 7 5 M€ allowing the deployment of low-carbon local energy solutions in France and Belgium  with the 2 new producing cogeneration units on the Avion (3 MW)  the integration of new cogeneration units to equip future mine gas capture sites in Hauts-de-France and the commissioning of its first 15 MW photovoltaic plant in the East of France.In Lorraine  pending the granting of the Blue Lorraine gas concession  FDE is developing two additional strategic areas related to the production of hydrogen and CO 2 storage. On hydrogen  FDE focuses on hydrogen production by methane pyrolysis and the production of natural hydrogen. As part of the Lorraine-State-Region Pact and work partnership with the GeoRessources laboratory  the significant CO 2 storage capacity in deep Lorraine coals has been demonstrated and work is continuing to prepare a first pilot demonstrator on a commercial scale.In addition  the large opportunities related to the development of Cryo Pur technology on biogas and treatment of industrial fumes growing markets in Western Europe are in the process of being contractualized  in order to launch on an operational level the first stages of standardization of gas purification and liquefaction equipment. This deployment will be done through key partnerships for the manufacture of equipment and dedicated corporate structures to support investments  operation and maintenance  and the sale of LBG and Bio-CO2 produced by the facilities.Finally  FDE continues to assess external growth opportunities to strengthen its position as a European leader in energy production solutions that reduce greenhouse gas emissions for consumers  manufacturers and individuals.FDE confirms its FY 2026 objectives of annual revenues of more than €100 million  and an EBITDA above €50 million  combined with over 10 million tons of CO 2 eq emissions avoided per annumNext announcements:Q3 2022 sales - April 25th 2023[1] Results of the companies Cellcius dedicated to the operation of the Creutzwald thermal solar plant (51% owned by FDE and 49% by Énes) and FalkenSun dedicated to the construction and operation of the photovoltaic solar plant of FalkenSun (75% owned by FDE and 25% by Mercury Advisors)",neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,positive,0.91,0.08,0.01,True,English,"['La Française', 'Half-year results', 'Energie', 'March', 'FY', 'future mine gas capture sites', 'strong positive operating cash flow', 'two additional strategic areas', 'industrial fumes growing markets', 'new ""Power Purchase Agreements', 'carbon negative energy producer', 'Blue Lorraine gas concession', 'rising interest rates environment', 'low-carbon local energy solutions', '2 new producing cogeneration units', 'significant CO 2 storage capacity', 'first 15 MW photovoltaic plant', 'new cogeneration units', '15 operational cogeneration units', 'first photovoltaic project', 'energy price market', 'good business momentum', 'low-carbon energy portfolio', 'sustained investment policy', 'annual Operating Income', 'first pilot demonstrator', 'deep Lorraine coals', 'lower financial charges', '€20 million second tranche', 'The Operating Income', 'ongoing costs control', 'Solid financial structure', 'green bond debt', 'Net income aggregates', 'electricity production capacity', 'Cryo Pur technology', 'FDE financial aggregates', 'FY 2023 Half-year results', 'operating profit', 'strong improvement', 'inflationary environment', 'green electricity', 'cogeneration portfolio', 'cash position', 'cash balance', 'first half', 'first 6 months', 'net debt', 'strong growth', 'Financial Result', 'financial year', 'second half', 'selling price', 'Sharp improvement', 'profitability trajectory', 'Consolidated accounts', 'Euro Thousands', 'Minority interests', 'last 12 months', 'continuous optimization', 'inflationary context', 'administrative expenses', 'IFRS accounting', 'free shares', 'tax charge', 'previous period', 'Ongoing developments', 'Avion (3 MW', 'methane pyrolysis', 'Lorraine-State-Region Pact', 'GeoRessources laboratory', 'commercial scale', 'large opportunities', 'Western Europe', 'cost control', 'growth opportunities', 'organic growth', 'spectacular growth', 'growth strategy', 'margin objectives', 'The Group', 'equity ratio', 'natural hydrogen', 'Group share', 'hydrogen production', 'EBITDA margin', '22.5 MW', '74% margin', 'Pontpierre', 'France', 'March', 'Euronext', '134% increased', 'revenues', '278) Taxes', 'activities', 'H1', 'Belgium', 'prices', 'contribution', 'performance', 'goods', 'services', 'employees', 'end', '14.6 M', 'December', 'January', 'PPAs', 'change', 'WCR', '5.7 M', 'use', 'capital', 'June', 'level', 'investments', '7,5 M€', 'deployment', 'integration', 'commissioning', 'East', 'granting', 'part', 'work', 'biogas', 'treatment', 'process', 'order']",2023-03-23,2023-03-24,marketscreener.com

Full login details are available on our website: https://www.voltalia.com/fr/investor-relations.“2022 turnover increased and EBITDA was stable despite the sale in November 2021 of the VSM2 and VSM4 Brazilian plants  in line with the strategy  and a low level of resources. 2022 was operationally very dynamic with 442 megawatts commissioned and an increase of 884 megawatts in our plants under construction. This enabled us to reach our target of 2.6 gigawatts a year ahead of schedule  an increase of 52% in 2022.  This momentum has prepared 2023: the full-year effect of the 2022 commissioning  the 2023 commissioning expected of on going constructions  the contractual indexation of turnover to inflation and the effects of the service contracts already signed  reinforce 2023 EBITDA target. At the same time  in order to move forward to our new 2027 target  we are proud to have won a record 1.1 gigawatts of long-term power sales contracts in 2022  which will be backed by new power plants "" commented Sébastien Clerc  Voltalia’s CEO.KEY FIGURESIn € million 2022 2021 ChangeAt current exchange rates ChangeAt constant exchange rates4 Turnover5 469.0 358.7 +31% +24% EBITDA 137.4 137.6 stable -10% Net result  Group share -7.2 -1.3 na naTurnover set at €469.0 million  up +31% compared to 2021 (+24% at constant exchange rates). Turnover from Energy Sales increased by +18% and those from Services by +49% (after elimination of internal sales of Services)  thanks to growth in the Development  Construction and Equipment Procurement segment (+52%) and in the Operation & Maintenance segment (+20%).Consolidated EBITDA set at €137.4 million  stable compared to 2021 (-10% at constant exchange rates)  impacted by the deconsolidation of the VSM2 and VSM4 plants  sold in November 2021  in line with the Group strategy that develops more sites it wishes to keep  and by the decrease in wind resources.Net income  Group share  amounted to -€7.2 million  compared with -€1.3 million in 2021.REVIEW OF ACTIVITIESEnergy SalesFinancial key figures In € millionBefore eliminations of services provided internally 2022 2021 ChangeAt current exchange rates ChangeAt constant exchange rates Turnover 244.7 207.9 +18% +6% EBITDA 143.1 128.1 +12% +1% EBITDA margin 58% 62% -4pts -3 ptsOperational indicators2021 2020 Change LoadLong-term average (Voltalia) Factors6Long-termaverage(national) Production (in GWh) 3 680 4 143 -13% Installed capacity and under construction (in MW)7 2 592 1 709 +52% Wind load factor in Brazil 42% 49% -7pts 52% 39% Wind load factor in France 22% 29% -7pts 26% 21% Solar load factor in France 18% 17% +1pt 18% 15% Solar load factor in Egypt 25% 25% stable 23% NDTurnover up despite lower productionVoltalia’s operating capacity was 1 571 MW at the end of December 2022  up to +39% year-on-year  with 442 MW commissioned  mainly SSM1-2 in Brazil  South Farm in the UK  Stavria in Greece and Carrière des Plaines in France  and Helexia’s solar roofs in France  Portugal  Italy and Hungary.However  production is down by -13% to 3.7 terawatthours between 2021 and 2022. This change is explained by (i) the sale in November 2021 of the VSM2 and VSM4 wind farms in Brazil  which had produced 0.6 terawatthours in 2021  (ii) the weight of commissioning during the second half of the year  with no full-year effect in 2022  and (iii) lower resources than in 2021 due to unfavourable wind weather in Brazil and France  with load factors below the long-term average – but still higher than the country average  as in every year  illustrating Voltalia’s high selectivity for the best projects in the best locations.Despite the decrease in production  2022 turnover from Energy Sales is up by +18% (+6% at constant exchange rates) at €244.7 million.Turnover growth was driven by the increase in the average sales price per MWh due to: (i) contractual sales prices that are mostly indexed to inflation  (ii) the exit from the scope of power plants with low prices per MWh  replaced by projects with higher prices and (iii) the strengthening of the Brazilian real.The weighted average residual term of all electricity sales contracts is 16.5 years  representing €7.8 billion of future contracted turnover (+18% compared to 2021). 78% of the 2022 turnover from long-term power sales contracts is contractually indexed to inflation. This data illustrates Voltalia’s investment strategy  as power plants without long  indexed contracts are generally sold before construction  as are most subsidised projects.EBITDA upEnergy Sales  although impacted by a lower resource in 2022 than the long-term average  generated an EBITDA of €143.1 million  up to +12% (+1% at constant exchange rates).The EBITDA margin was 58%  down -4 points. With a wind and solar resource corresponding to the long-term average  the EBITDA margin would have been 62%.ServicesIn € millionBefore eliminations of services provided internally 2022 2021 ChangeAt current exchange rates ChangeAt constant exchange rates Turnover 352.3 220.1 +60% +58% Of which internal turnover 127.9 69.2 +85% +79% Of which external turnover 224.3 150.9 +49% +49% EBITDA 30.5 32.8 -7% -11% EBITDA margin 9% 15% -6pts -7ptsTurnover from Services (internal and external) set at 352.3 million  up to 60% (+58% at constant exchange rates).EBITDA decreased by -7% (-11% at constant exchange rates)  with an EBITDA margin of 9%  down 6 points(-7 points at constant exchange rates).Development  Construction and Equipment ProcurementThe Development  Construction and Equipment Procurement segment shows a turnover of €319.4 million  up to +66% (+65% at constant exchange rates).External turnover (to third party customers) increased by +52%. The business is growing rapidly thanks to sustained prospecting efforts. Development was driven by Brazil  while Construction and Equipment Procurement were dynamic in Europe and Africa. Equipment Procurement was the fastest growing business  as European demand has been particularly strong since the start of the war in Ukraine.Internal turnover (eliminated on consolidation) increased by 99% thanks to the dynamism of the new power plants launched on the balance sheet of Voltalia and its subsidiary Helexia.EBITDA for the Development  Construction and Equipment Procurement segment decreased by 11% in 2022 to €28.7 million. The EBITDA margin is 9%  down -8 points due to the combined effect of (i) the base effect of project disposals with the sale of VSM2 and VSM4 in 2021  (ii) inflation in the costs of certain equipments and services and (iii) the greater relative weight of Equipment Procurement  which is by nature low-risk and therefore less margined  than in 2021.Operation and maintenanceTurnover from the Operation & Maintenance segment reached €32.9 million  up to +19% (+15% at constant exchange rates). New external contracts (for third party customers) were signed for 694 MW  including 376 MW in Europe and 318 MW in Brazil. New internal contracts (whose turnover is eliminated in consolidation) have followed the growth of Voltalia’s operating power plants.At the end of 2022  the capacity under management for Voltalia and its third party customers is 4.4 GW (+29%)  of which 2.8 GW (+17%) is for external customers  demonstrating the commercial success of the Group’s offering.The segment showed €1.8 million EBITDA  multiplied by 2.7 in 2022 (and multiplied by 2.4 at constant exchange rates)  benefiting from scale effects in a context of cost control.OTHER ITEMS OF THE INCOME STATEMENTChange In € million 2022 2021 At actualrates At constant rates EBITDA before eliminations and corporate 173.7 160.9 +8% -1% Eliminations and corporate 36.3 23.3 +55% +54% EBITDA 137.4 137.6 stable stable Depreciation  amortisation  and provisions -81.5 -75.7 +8% 0% Operating revenue (EBIT) 55.9 61.9 -10% -24% Financial result -44.9 -43.9 +2% 10% Taxes and net income of equity affiliates -18.4 -16.8 +9% +5% Minority interests 0.2 -2.5 na na Net result (Group share) -7.2 -1.3 na naEBITDA before eliminations and corporate items increased by +8% to €173.7 million. Eliminations were up  reflecting the growth in internal activity. Corporate items were also up  but at a much lower rate than overall activity  illustrating Voltalia’s ability to generate economies of scale. Consolidated EBITDA was €137.4 million  stable compared to 2021.Depreciation  amortization and provisions amounted to 81.5 million  up +8%  mainly due to the depreciation of power plants commissioned in 2022  the full-year effect of power plants commissioned in 2021 and the deconsolidation of VSM2 and VSM4.At €45 million  net financial expenses slightly increased by +2%  reflecting the rigorous hedging policy that provided effective protection against rising interest rates on loans. The financial result also reflects the increase in project debt and corporate facilities8 of which 323 million was repaid after the capital increase.After taking into account minority interests and taxes  the net result  group share  amounts to -€7.2 million  compared to -€1.3 million in 2021.SIMPLIFIED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETVoltalia's balance sheet at the end of 2022 reached €3 billion  up to +44%.In € million 31/12/2022 31/12/2021 Goodwill 87 78 Tangible and intangible fixed assets 2 074 1 510 Cash and cash equivalents 384 291 Other assets 490 234 Total assets 3 035 2 113 Equity  Group share 1 232 672 Minorities 107 62 Financial debt 1 313 1 050 Provisions 26 14 Other current and non-current liabilities 357 315 Total liabilities 3 035 2 113With fixed assets up by +37%  the growth in the Group's assets is essentially linked to the increase in power plants in operation and  even more so  those under construction.Other assets amounted to €490 million at the end of 2022 and were up €256 million  of which (i) €201 million mainly corresponded to the increase in inventories  supplier advances and trade and tax receivables due to the growth of activities  including power plant projects under construction and (ii) €54 million increase in financial assets related to our hedging policy.The cash position stands at €384 million  up to +32% compared to the end of 2021. This level compares with total financial debt of €1 313 million at the end of 2022  up to +25%  in line with the growth of fixed assets.Equity is up 83%  mainly due to the successful capital increase in December 2022.The capital increase is also the main reason for the decrease of about 10 points in leverage Debt leverage9  which stands at 41%.NEW ANNOUNCEMENTS OF THE GROUPFuture contracted turnover up to €7.8 billion (+18%)Voltalia announced today that its long-term visibility has further improved with future turnover secured by electricity sales contracts amounting to €7.8 billion at the end of December 2022 (+€1.2 billion vs. 2021)  i.e. x16.6 of 2022 turnover. This particularly high level is the result of Voltalia's strategy of seeking very long-term electricity sales contracts covering most of the production of the power plants in its portfolio.Expansion of the portfolio of projects in development: 14.2 GW (+28%)Voltalia announced today that its portfolio of projects under development  to be retained or sold with construction and maintenance services  amounted to 14.2 GW at the end of December 2022  an increase of +3.1 GW in one year. Illustrating the growing importance of the geographical diversification strategy  this portfolio is split 38%  38% and 24% in Latin America  Europe and Africa respectively. In terms of technology  solar is the majority  at 65%  followed by wind at 29% and other technologies at 6%.In French Guiana  construction of the Sinnamary biomass plant  an investment of €200 millionVoltalia today announced the construction of the largest biomass power plant in French Guyana (10.6 MW).

This enabled us to reach our target of 2.6 gigawatts a year ahead of schedule  an increase of 52% in 2022.  This momentum has prepared 2023: the full-year effect of the 2022 commissioning  the 2023 commissioning expected of on going constructions  the contractual indexation of turnover to inflation and the effects of the service contracts already signed  reinforce 2023 EBITDA target. At the same time  in order to move forward to our new 2027 target  we are proud to have won a record 1.1 gigawatts of long-term power sales contracts in 2022  which will be backed by new power plants "" commented Sébastien Clerc  Voltalia’s CEO.

Turnover from Energy Sales increased by +18% and those from Services by +49% (after elimination of internal sales of Services)  thanks to growth in the Development  Construction and Equipment Procurement segment (+52%) and in the Operation & Maintenance segment (+20%). Consolidated EBITDA set at €137.4 million  stable compared to 2021 (-10% at constant exchange rates)  impacted by the deconsolidation of the VSM2 and VSM4 plants  sold in November 2021  in line with the Group strategy that develops more sites it wishes to keep  and by the decrease in wind resources.

However  production is down by -13% to 3.7 terawatthours between 2021 and 2022. This change is explained by (i) the sale in November 2021 of the VSM2 and VSM4 wind farms in Brazil  which had produced 0.6 terawatthours in 2021  (ii) the weight of commissioning during the second half of the year  with no full-year effect in 2022  and (iii) lower resources than in 2021 due to unfavourable wind weather in Brazil and France  with load factors below the long-term average – but still higher than the country average  as in every year  illustrating Voltalia’s high selectivity for the best projects in the best locations. Despite the decrease in production  2022 turnover from Energy Sales is up by +18% (+6% at constant exchange rates) at €244.7 million. Turnover growth was driven by the increase in the average sales price per MWh due to: (i) contractual sales prices that are mostly indexed to inflation  (ii) the exit from the scope of power plants with low prices per MWh  replaced by projects with higher prices and (iii) the strengthening of the Brazilian real. The weighted average residual term of all electricity sales contracts is 16.5 years  representing €7.8 billion of future contracted turnover (+18% compared to 2021). 78% of the 2022 turnover from long-term power sales contracts is contractually indexed to inflation. This data illustrates Voltalia’s investment strategy  as power plants without long  indexed contracts are generally sold before construction  as are most subsidised projects. EBITDA upEnergy Sales  although impacted by a lower resource in 2022 than the long-term average  generated an EBITDA of €143.1 million  up to +12% (+1% at constant exchange rates). The EBITDA margin was 58%  down -4 points. With a wind and solar resource corresponding to the long-term average  the EBITDA margin would have been 62%.

EBITDA decreased by -7% (-11% at constant exchange rates)  with an EBITDA margin of 9%  down 6 points(-7 points at constant exchange rates). Development  Construction and Equipment ProcurementThe Development  Construction and Equipment Procurement segment shows a turnover of €319.4 million  up to +66% (+65% at constant exchange rates). External turnover (to third party customers) increased by +52%. The business is growing rapidly thanks to sustained prospecting efforts. Development was driven by Brazil  while Construction and Equipment Procurement were dynamic in Europe and Africa. Equipment Procurement was the fastest growing business  as European demand has been particularly strong since the start of the war in Ukraine. Internal turnover (eliminated on consolidation) increased by 99% thanks to the dynamism of the new power plants launched on the balance sheet of Voltalia and its subsidiary Helexia. EBITDA for the Development  Construction and Equipment Procurement segment decreased by 11% in 2022 to €28.7 million. The EBITDA margin is 9%  down -8 points due to the combined effect of (i) the base effect of project disposals with the sale of VSM2 and VSM4 in 2021  (ii) inflation in the costs of certain equipments and services and (iii) the greater relative weight of Equipment Procurement  which is by nature low-risk and therefore less margined  than in 2021. Operation and maintenanceTurnover from the Operation & Maintenance segment reached €32.9 million  up to +19% (+15% at constant exchange rates). New external contracts (for third party customers) were signed for 694 MW  including 376 MW in Europe and 318 MW in Brazil. New internal contracts (whose turnover is eliminated in consolidation) have followed the growth of Voltalia’s operating power plants. At the end of 2022  the capacity under management for Voltalia and its third party customers is 4.4 GW (+29%)  of which 2.8 GW (+17%) is for external customers  demonstrating the commercial success of the Group’s offering. The segment showed €1.8 million EBITDA  multiplied by 2.7 in 2022 (and multiplied by 2.4 at constant exchange rates)  benefiting from scale effects in a context of cost control.

Eliminations were up  reflecting the growth in internal activity. Corporate items were also up  but at a much lower rate than overall activity  illustrating Voltalia’s ability to generate economies of scale. Consolidated EBITDA was €137.4 million  stable compared to 2021. Depreciation  amortization and provisions amounted to 81.5 million  up +8%  mainly due to the depreciation of power plants commissioned in 2022  the full-year effect of power plants commissioned in 2021 and the deconsolidation of VSM2 and VSM4. At €45 million  net financial expenses slightly increased by +2%  reflecting the rigorous hedging policy that provided effective protection against rising interest rates on loans. The financial result also reflects the increase in project debt and corporate facilities8 of which 323 million was repaid after the capital increase.

Other assets amounted to €490 million at the end of 2022 and were up €256 million  of which (i) €201 million mainly corresponded to the increase in inventories  supplier advances and trade and tax receivables due to the growth of activities  including power plant projects under construction and (ii) €54 million increase in financial assets related to our hedging policy. The cash position stands at €384 million  up to +32% compared to the end of 2021. This level compares with total financial debt of €1 313 million at the end of 2022  up to +25%  in line with the growth of fixed assets. Equity is up 83%  mainly due to the successful capital increase in December 2022. The capital increase is also the main reason for the decrease of about 10 points in leverage Debt leverage9  which stands at 41%.

However  production is down by -13% to 3.7 terawatthours between 2021 and 2022. This change is explained by (i) the sale in November 2021 of the VSM2 and VSM4 wind farms in Brazil  which had produced 0.6 terawatthours in 2021  (ii) the weight of commissioning during the second half of the year  with no full-year effect in 2022  and (iii) lower resources than in 2021 due to unfavourable wind weather in Brazil and France  with load factors below the long-term average – but still higher than the country average  as in every year  illustrating Voltalia’s high selectivity for the best projects in the best locations. Despite the decrease in production  2022 turnover from Energy Sales is up by +18% (+6% at constant exchange rates) at €244.7 million. Turnover growth was driven by the increase in the average sales price per MWh due to: (i) contractual sales prices that are mostly indexed to inflation  (ii) the exit from the scope of power plants with low prices per MWh  replaced by projects with higher prices and (iii) the strengthening of the Brazilian real. The weighted average residual term of all electricity sales contracts is 16.5 years  representing €7.8 billion of future contracted turnover (+18% compared to 2021). 78% of the 2022 turnover from long-term power sales contracts is contractually indexed to inflation. This data illustrates Voltalia’s investment strategy  as power plants without long  indexed contracts are generally sold before construction  as are most subsidised projects. EBITDA upEnergy Sales  although impacted by a lower resource in 2022 than the long-term average  generated an EBITDA of €143.1 million  up to +12% (+1% at constant exchange rates). The EBITDA margin was 58%  down -4 points. With a wind and solar resource corresponding to the long-term average  the EBITDA margin would have been 62%.

EBITDA decreased by -7% (-11% at constant exchange rates)  with an EBITDA margin of 9%  down 6 points(-7 points at constant exchange rates). Development  Construction and Equipment ProcurementThe Development  Construction and Equipment Procurement segment shows a turnover of €319.4 million  up to +66% (+65% at constant exchange rates). External turnover (to third party customers) increased by +52%. The business is growing rapidly thanks to sustained prospecting efforts. Development was driven by Brazil  while Construction and Equipment Procurement were dynamic in Europe and Africa. Equipment Procurement was the fastest growing business  as European demand has been particularly strong since the start of the war in Ukraine. Internal turnover (eliminated on consolidation) increased by 99% thanks to the dynamism of the new power plants launched on the balance sheet of Voltalia and its subsidiary Helexia. EBITDA for the Development  Construction and Equipment Procurement segment decreased by 11% in 2022 to €28.7 million. The EBITDA margin is 9%  down -8 points due to the combined effect of (i) the base effect of project disposals with the sale of VSM2 and VSM4 in 2021  (ii) inflation in the costs of certain equipments and services and (iii) the greater relative weight of Equipment Procurement  which is by nature low-risk and therefore less margined  than in 2021. Operation and maintenanceTurnover from the Operation & Maintenance segment reached €32.9 million  up to +19% (+15% at constant exchange rates). New external contracts (for third party customers) were signed for 694 MW  including 376 MW in Europe and 318 MW in Brazil. New internal contracts (whose turnover is eliminated in consolidation) have followed the growth of Voltalia’s operating power plants. At the end of 2022  the capacity under management for Voltalia and its third party customers is 4.4 GW (+29%)  of which 2.8 GW (+17%) is for external customers  demonstrating the commercial success of the Group’s offering. The segment showed €1.8 million EBITDA  multiplied by 2.7 in 2022 (and multiplied by 2.4 at constant exchange rates)  benefiting from scale effects in a context of cost control.

Eliminations were up  reflecting the growth in internal activity. Corporate items were also up  but at a much lower rate than overall activity  illustrating Voltalia’s ability to generate economies of scale. Consolidated EBITDA was €137.4 million  stable compared to 2021. Depreciation  amortization and provisions amounted to 81.5 million  up +8%  mainly due to the depreciation of power plants commissioned in 2022  the full-year effect of power plants commissioned in 2021 and the deconsolidation of VSM2 and VSM4. At €45 million  net financial expenses slightly increased by +2%  reflecting the rigorous hedging policy that provided effective protection against rising interest rates on loans. The financial result also reflects the increase in project debt and corporate facilities8 of which 323 million was repaid after the capital increase. After taking into account minority interests and taxes  the net result  group share  amounts to -€7.2 million  compared to -€1.3 million in 2021.

Other assets amounted to €490 million at the end of 2022 and were up €256 million  of which (i) €201 million mainly corresponded to the increase in inventories  supplier advances and trade and tax receivables due to the growth of activities  including power plant projects under construction and (ii) €54 million increase in financial assets related to our hedging policy. The cash position stands at €384 million  up to +32% compared to the end of 2021. This level compares with total financial debt of €1 313 million at the end of 2022  up to +25%  in line with the growth of fixed assets. Equity is up 83%  mainly due to the successful capital increase in December 2022. The capital increase is also the main reason for the decrease of about 10 points in leverage Debt leverage9  which stands at 41%. NEW ANNOUNCEMENTS OF THE GROUP Future contracted turnover up to €7.8 billion (+18%) Voltalia announced today that its long-term visibility has further improved with future turnover secured by electricity sales contracts amounting to €7.8 billion at the end of December 2022 (+€1.2 billion vs. 2021)  i.e. x16.6 of 2022 turnover. This particularly high level is the result of Voltalia's strategy of seeking very long-term electricity sales contracts covering most of the production of the power plants in its portfolio. Expansion of the portfolio of projects in development: 14.2 GW (+28%) Voltalia announced today that its portfolio of projects under development  to be retained or sold with construction and maintenance services  amounted to 14.2 GW at the end of December 2022  an increase of +3.1 GW in one year. Illustrating the growing importance of the geographical diversification strategy  this portfolio is split 38%  38% and 24% in Latin America  Europe and Africa respectively. In terms of technology  solar is the majority  at 65%  followed by wind at 29% and other technologies at 6%. In French Guiana  construction of the Sinnamary biomass plant  an investment of €200 million Voltalia today announced the construction of the largest biomass power plant in French Guyana (10.6 MW). Developed  built and owned by Voltalia  the plant will make use of the wood immersed in the lake of the Petit-Saut dam  harvested and processed by a Voltalia subsidiary: Triton. The project  which should be commissioned in the first half of 2025  represents an investment of around €200 million. The electricity produced by the biomass plant is covered by a 25-year sales contract. Voltalia has already been operating the Kourou (1.7 MW) and Cacao (5.1 MW) biomass plants in French Guiana since 2011 and 2020 respectively. New construction contracts in Ireland for 142 MW Voltalia today announced that Power Capital  a leading Irish independent company majority owned by French renewable energy pioneer Omnes  has selected Voltalia to build  operate and maintain its three photovoltaic projects in the south-east of the Republic of Ireland with a combined capacity of 142 MW. Increase in the amount of the recent impact syndicated loan10 Voltalia announces today that the amount of its recently signed impact credit facility has been increased to €280 million  with Mizuho Bank joining the banking syndicate. This new credit line replicates the innovative framework of those put in place in 2019 and 2021: the interest rate may be subsidised depending on the achievement of certain Environmental  Social and Governance (ESG) criteria. The increase announced today brings the total amount of corporate bank credit facilities available to the Group to €520 million. LATEST DEVELOPMENTS Voltalia enters the SBF 12011 On 17 March (after the stock exchange)  the company was included in one of the main indices of the Paris Stock Exchange  which includes the top 120 stocks listed on Euronext Paris in terms of liquidity and market capitalisation.

Start of electricity production for Helexia in Brazil13 After signing a contract for the supply of 87 MW of solar energy to Vivo  a subsidiary of Telefonica  based on a series of distributed generation projects in eight Brazilian states  Helexia successfully completed a first 4.9 MW tranche in the municipality of Paranaíba (Mato Grosso do Sul state). In Portugal  a corporate PPA was signed with BA Glass and production started in Garrido14 BA Glass  a European leader in the production of hollow glass for the beverage and food industries  will have access to 12.4 MW to be produced by the Garrido complex. With this new 15-year contract  the entire output of the 50.6 MW complex is now secured by long-term sales contracts. Construction started in September 2022 and the first megawatts were commissioned in early March 2023. Signature with Leroy Merlin of the first corporate PPA for a new wind power plant in France15 The contract signed with Leroy Merlin in February 2023 covers the production of a 23.6 MW wind farm  currently under construction. This is the first additional corporate PPA for wind power signed in France: it is the first time that a company has committed to a long-term (23 years) supply from a new wind farm dedicated to it as soon as it is commissioned. 2023 AMBITIONS CONFIRMED Voltalia highlights that its target of 2.6 GW of capacity in operation and under construction  planned to be reached by the end of 2023  was achieved at the end of 202216  one year ahead of schedule. Voltalia also reiterates its 2023 normalised EBITDA17 target between €275 and €300 million.Voltalia announces that €235 million of 2023 normalised EBITDA has already been secured by existing energy sales and services sales contracts: Approximately €223 million in its Energy Sales activity (before eliminations)  resulting from (i) the effect of the contractual indexation of turnover on inflation for plants older than one year  (ii) the full-year effect for plants commissioned in 2022 and (iii) the production of plants that have been and will be commissioned in 2023 (1 GW is currently under construction  of which 0.8 GW will start production before the end of the year);Approximately €57 million in its Services activity (before eliminations) from contracts signed by the segments (i) Development  Construction and Equipment Procurement and (ii) Operations & Maintenance; andApproximately -€45 million of eliminations and corporate items. Voltalia expects to sign new contracts later this year that will generate additional normalised EBITDA to achieve the 2023 target while preparing for the following years. 2027 AMBITIONS REAFFIRMED Voltalia confirms its objectives set last October as part of its new growth plan for 2027  namely - Capacity in operation and construction: over 5 GW; - Capacity operated on behalf of third parties: over 8 GW; - Normalised EBITDA18: around €475 million; - CO 2 -equivalent avoided: over 4 million tonnes.

The following items are adjusted: fixed asset depreciation and impairments (€49.5 million)  provisions for risks and charges (€-0.3 million)  provisions related to employee benefits (-€0.1 million)  and other expenses and income without any impact on the cash position (€0.9 million)  and impacts related to disposals (+€0.4 million).The accounts were audited by the statutory auditors and examined by the board of directors on March 21  2023. The report of the statutory auditors is in the process of being issued. The statements and detailed presentation of annual income are available on the corporate site at corporate.virbac.com.Thanks to the Virbac teams’ constant dedication to animal health  we posted revenue for the year of €1 216.2 million  an increase of +14.3% compared to 2021. Adjusted for the favorable impact of exchange rates  revenue shows growth of +9.6%  despite the slowdown in the market. Excellent execution of our strategic plan allowed us to reinforce our annual organic growth in all geographic areas. In Asia-Pacific  growth at real exchange rates came to +18.5% (+13.8% at constant exchange rates); India and Australia continue to drive growth in the area  thanks to products for cattle  representing approximately 80% of this growth. In Europe  revenue is growing at +6.3% at real rates (+5.9% at constant rates). The main contributors to this performance are the United Kingdom  France  Italy  and Spain. The area is supported by the strong dynamism of the companion animal ranges (in particular petfood  specialties  and vaccines)  which compensated for the decline in the antibiotic ranges for farm animals. In the United States  business grew by +30.2% (+15.7% at constant exchange rates). It benefited from sustained sales for new products launched in 2021 (Clomicalm and Itrafungol) and those launched in early 2022 (petfood  and Tulissin for the farm animals segment)  as well as good performance in the dental  specialties (Movoflex  Stelfonta)  and dermatology ranges. Finally  in Latin America  business grew by +17.1% at real rates (+5.6% at constant exchange rates)  thanks in particular to the contribution of Mexico and Brazil  which offset the downturn in Chile. It should be noted that the effect of the increase in average prices recorded in 2022 compared to 2021 represents approximately five percentage points of growth.The current operating income before depreciation of assets arising from acquisitions amounts to €186.6 million  significantly up compared to 2021 (€173.2 million). This improvement in performance is mainly due to the growth in our revenue  driven by strong performance in all areas despite a market slowdown. This was partially offset by a relative deterioration in the margin due to the impacts of inflation on raw material costs and operating expenses such as transport and energy. Our commercial expenses have increased (travel expenses  seminars  etc.)  post Covid-19 period. Similarly  our R&D expenses are up significantly  following our desire to increase the number of projects in our portfolio. After normalizing R&D (+1 percentage point at constant exchange rates)  our ratio of “current operating income  before depreciation of assets arising from acquisitions” to “revenue” at the end of December 2022 is slightly increased compared to the same period for 2021 (16.4% in 2022 vs. 16.3% in 2021) at constant rates.Consolidated net income was €121.3 million  up 4.9% compared to the same period for 2021. This improvement in our net income is explained by the reasons given above  especially the growth of our business and good control of our operating expenses  which remain relatively contained as a proportion of our revenue  despite the inflationary pressure observed in 2022. The consolidated net income is also impacted by a non-current and non-cash charge of €3.3 million corresponding to an impairment loss for brands that are no longer used. Lastly  it should be noted that our operating income includes a charge of €3.1 million  which is significantly down compared to the end of December 2021 (charge of €8.5 million). This is due to the decrease in the cost of gross financial debt of €2.3 million mainly related to the maturity of rate derivatives  and the sharp increase in cash instruments (+€2.5 million)  following the increase in our investments and remuneration rates from June 2022.Net income - Group share amounted to €122.0 million in 2022  an increase compared to the previous year (€113.2 million)  which is explained by the elements detailed above.From a financial standpoint  our net financial cash amounts to €79.4 million at the end of December 2022  compared to €73.8 million at the end of December 2021. This positive change in our cash position over the year is mainly due to strong cash generation  which enabled the financing of more sustained capital expenditures (Capex)  higher working capital requirements in 2022 given the strong increase in our revenue  and finally the payment of dividends with respect to the 2021 profit.OutlookIn 2023  we expect a ratio of “current operating income before depreciation of assets resulting from acquisitions” to “revenue” that should be between 13% and 14% at constant exchange rates  with growth in revenue at constant rates and scope estimated at this stage to be between 4% and 6%. This deterioration in our adjusted EBIT ratio is primarily the result of our deliberate acceleration in R&D investment to revenue since early 2022 (~+2 percentage points in 2023 compared to 2021 and +~1 point compared to 2022)  and the expected effects of inflation in 2023.In addition  our cash position is expected to remain constant at the end of 2023 compared to the end of 2022  given the expected investments over the period  estimated to be around €100 million  from the acceleration of R&D  and excluding any acquisitions.Ultimately  at the next general meeting of shareholders  a net dividend of €1.32 per share will be recommended for distribution for the 2022 fiscal year  in evolution compared to €1.25 in 2021.ANALYSTS’ PRESENTATION – VIRBACWe will hold an analysts meeting on Friday  March 24  2023 at 2:30 p.m. (Paris time - CET) in the Edouard VII Business Center’s auditorium  23 square Edouard VII - 75 009 Paris (France).Participants may arrive 15 minutes before the start of the meeting.You may also attend the meeting using the webcast (audio + slides) available via the link below.Information for participants:Webcast access link: https ://bit.ly/3Zqm5LgThis access link is available on the corporate.virbac.com site  under the heading “Public releases.” This link allows participants to access the live and/or archived version of the webcast.You will be able to ask questions via chat (text) directly during the webcast or after watching the replay via the following email address: finances@virbac.com.A lifelong commitment to animal healthAt Virbac  we provide innovative solutions to veterinarians  farmers and animal owners in more than 100 countries around the world.

This deterioration in our adjusted EBIT ratio is primarily the result of our deliberate acceleration in R&D investment to revenue since early 2022 (~+2 percentage points in 2023 compared to 2021 and +~1 point compared to 2022)  and the expected effects of inflation in 2023.In addition  our cash position is expected to remain constant at the end of 2023 compared to the end of 2022  given the expected investments over the period  estimated to be around €100 million  from the acceleration of R&D  and excluding any acquisitions.Ultimately  at the next general meeting of shareholders  a net dividend of €1.32 per share will be recommended for distribution for the 2022 fiscal year  in evolution compared to €1.25 in 2021.ANALYSTS’ PRESENTATION – VIRBACWe will hold an analysts meeting on Friday  March 24  2023 at 2:30 p.m. (Paris time - CET) in the Edouard VII Business Center’s auditorium  23 square Edouard VII - 75 009 Paris (France).Participants may arrive 15 minutes before the start of the meeting.You may also attend the meeting using the webcast (audio + slides) available via the link below.Information for participants:Webcast access link: https ://bit.ly/3Zqm5LgThis access link is available on the corporate.virbac.com site  under the heading “Public releases.” This link allows participants to access the live and/or archived version of the webcast.You will be able to ask questions via chat (text) directly during the webcast or after watching the replay via the following email address: finances@virbac.com.A lifelong commitment to animal healthAt Virbac  we provide innovative solutions to veterinarians  farmers and animal owners in more than 100 countries around the world.

March 23  2023. The primary and all key secondary endpoints were met in a Phase 3 trial evaluating the investigational use of Dupixent® (dupilumab) compared to placebo in adults currently on maximal standard-of-care inhaled therapy (triple therapy) with uncontrolled chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and evidence of type 2 inflammation. Dupixent is the first and only biologic to demonstrate a clinically meaningful and highly significant reduction (30%) in moderate or severe acute exacerbations of COPD (rapid and acute worsening of respiratory symptoms)  while also demonstrating significant improvements in lung function  quality of life and COPD respiratory symptoms.Dietmar Berger  M.D.  Ph.D.Head of Global R&D ad interim and Chief Medical Officer at Sanofi""Change cannot come quick enough for people living with uncontrolled COPD but  unfortunately  many investigational treatments have failed to demonstrate significant clinical outcomes leaving these vulnerable patients with limited treatment options. We took a bold approach with our direct to Phase 3 program  shaving years off standard clinical development timelines. We are excited to share these unprecedented and potentially paradigm-shifting clinical results  which may give new hope to patients  caregivers and physicians.”COPD is a life-threatening respiratory disease that damages the lungs and causes progressive lung function decline. Symptoms include persistent cough and breathlessness that may not only impair the ability to perform routine daily activities  but can also lead to anxiety  depression and sleep disturbances. COPD is also associated with a significant health and economic burden due to recurrent acute exacerbations that require systemic corticosteroid treatment and/or lead to hospitalization or even death. Smoking is a key risk factor for COPD  but even individuals who quit smoking can still develop the disease. In the U.S. alone  approximately 300 000 people live with uncontrolled COPD with type 2 inflammation.George D. Yancopoulos  M.D.  Ph.D.President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron“COPD is an urgent global health concern and a notoriously difficult-to-treat disease due to its heterogeneity  with no novel treatments approved in more than a decade. In this landmark Phase 3 trial  patients with uncontrolled COPD achieved clinical outcomes with Dupixent at a magnitude never before seen with a biologic. These results also validate the role type 2 inflammation plays in driving COPD in these patients  advancing the scientific community’s understanding of the underlying biology of this disease. We look forward to discussing these exciting results with regulatory authorities.”In the BOREAS Phase 3 trial (the first of two Phase 3 trials)  939 adults who were current or former smokers aged 40 to 80 years were randomized to receive Dupixent (n=468) or placebo (n=471)  added to maximal standard-of-care inhaled therapy. Patients receiving Dupixent experienced:30% reduction in moderate or severe acute COPD exacerbations over 52 weeks (p=0.0005)  the primary endpoint.Improved lung function from baseline by 160 mL at 12 weeks compared to 77 mL for placebo (p<0.0001)  with the benefit versus placebo sustained through week 52 (p=0.0003)  both of which were key secondary endpoints.Dupixent met all endpoints tested in the hierarchy  including improvement in patient-reported health-related quality of life as measured by St. George’s Respiratory Questionaire (SGRQ) and reduction in the severity of respiratory symptoms of COPD as measured by Evaluation Respiratory Symptoms: COPD (E-RS: COPD) Scale.The safety results were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. Overall rates of adverse events (AE) were 77% for Dupixent and 76% for placebo. AEs more commonly observed with Dupixent compared to placebo included headache (8.1% Dupixent  6.8% placebo)  diarrhea (5.3% Dupixent  3.6% placebo) and back pain (5.1% Dupixent  3.4% placebo). AEs more commonly observed with placebo compared to Dupixent included upper respiratory tract infection (9.8% placebo  7.9% Dupixent)  hypertension (6.0% placebo  3.6% Dupixent) and COVID-19 (5.7% placebo  4.1% Dupixent). AEs leading to deaths were balanced between the two arms (1.7% placebo  1.5% Dupixent).Detailed efficacy and safety results from this trial will be presented in a future scientific forum.The broader Sanofi and Regeneron COPD clinical research program includes Phase 3 trials with itepekimab  a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits interleukin-33 (IL-33). Itepekimab received Fast Track Designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in January 2023 for the treatment of COPD in patients who do not currently smoke. Data from this pivotal program is expected in 2025.The safety and efficacy of Dupixent and itepekimab in COPD have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About the Dupixent COPD Phase 3 Trial ProgramBOREAS is one of two pivotal trials in the Dupixent COPD program. The randomized  Phase 3  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in 939 adults who were current or former smokers aged 40 to 80 years with moderate-to-severe COPD. All patients in the trial had evidence of type 2 inflammation  as measured by blood eosinophils ≥300 cells/µL. During the 52-week treatment period  patients received Dupixent or placebo every two weeks  added to triple therapy of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)  long-acting beta agonists  and long-acting muscarinic antagonists. Double maintenance therapy was allowed if ICS was contraindicated.The primary endpoint evaluated the annualized rate of acute moderate or severe COPD exacerbations. Moderate exacerbations were defined as those requiring systemic steroids and/or antibiotics. Severe exacerbations were defined as those: requiring hospitalization; more than a day of observation in an emergency department or urgent care facility; or resulting in death. Key secondary endpoints included change from baseline in lung function (assessed by pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 ) at 12 and 52 weeks; change from baseline at week 52 in SGRQ total score compared to placebo; proportion of patients with SGRQ improvement ≥4 points at week 52; and the change from baseline at 52 weeks in the ERS: COPD Scale symptom scoreThe second  replicate Phase 3 trial of Dupixent in COPD (NOTUS) is ongoing with data expected in 2024.About Sanofi and Regeneron’s COPD Clinical Research ProgramSanofi and Regeneron are motivated to transform the treatment paradigm of COPD by examining the role different types of inflammation play in the disease progression through the investigation of two potentially first-in-class biologics  Dupixent and itepekimab.Dupixent inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and the program focuses on a specific population of people with evidence of type 2 inflammation. Itepekimab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits interleukin-33 (IL-33)  an initiator and amplifier of broad inflammation in COPD. Across both programs  four Phase 3 trials are ongoing and designed to inform next-generation treatments for people with COPD whom might not have other options.About DupixentDupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent  such as atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  prurigo nodularis and eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE).Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP  EoE or prurigo nodularis in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in Europe  the U.S. and Japan. More than 600 000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including pediatric EoE  hand and foot atopic dermatitis  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritus of unknown origin  COPD with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority....About RegeneronRegeneron (NASDAQ: REGN) is a leading biotechnology company that invents  develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

March 23  2023. The primary and all key secondary endpoints were met in a Phase 3 trial evaluating the investigational use of Dupixent® (dupilumab) compared to placebo in adults currently on maximal standard-of-care inhaled therapy (triple therapy) with uncontrolled chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and evidence of type 2 inflammation. Dupixent is the first and only biologic to demonstrate a clinically meaningful and highly significant reduction (30%) in moderate or severe acute exacerbations of COPD (rapid and acute worsening of respiratory symptoms)  while also demonstrating significant improvements in lung function  quality of life and COPD respiratory symptoms.Dietmar Berger  M.D.  Ph.D.Head of Global R&D ad interim and Chief Medical Officer at Sanofi""Change cannot come quick enough for people living with uncontrolled COPD but  unfortunately  many investigational treatments have failed to demonstrate significant clinical outcomes leaving these vulnerable patients with limited treatment options. We took a bold approach with our direct to Phase 3 program  shaving years off standard clinical development timelines. We are excited to share these unprecedented and potentially paradigm-shifting clinical results  which may give new hope to patients  caregivers and physicians.”COPD is a life-threatening respiratory disease that damages the lungs and causes progressive lung function decline. Symptoms include persistent cough and breathlessness that may not only impair the ability to perform routine daily activities  but can also lead to anxiety  depression and sleep disturbances. COPD is also associated with a significant health and economic burden due to recurrent acute exacerbations that require systemic corticosteroid treatment and/or lead to hospitalization or even death. Smoking is a key risk factor for COPD  but even individuals who quit smoking can still develop the disease. In the U.S. alone  approximately 300 000 people live with uncontrolled COPD with type 2 inflammation.George D. Yancopoulos  M.D.  Ph.D.President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron“COPD is an urgent global health concern and a notoriously difficult-to-treat disease due to its heterogeneity  with no novel treatments approved in more than a decade. In this landmark Phase 3 trial  patients with uncontrolled COPD achieved clinical outcomes with Dupixent at a magnitude never before seen with a biologic. These results also validate the role type 2 inflammation plays in driving COPD in these patients  advancing the scientific community’s understanding of the underlying biology of this disease. We look forward to discussing these exciting results with regulatory authorities.”In the BOREAS Phase 3 trial (the first of two Phase 3 trials)  939 adults who were current or former smokers aged 40 to 80 years were randomized to receive Dupixent (n=468) or placebo (n=471)  added to maximal standard-of-care inhaled therapy. Patients receiving Dupixent experienced:30% reduction in moderate or severe acute COPD exacerbations over 52 weeks (p=0.0005)  the primary endpoint.Improved lung function from baseline by 160 mL at 12 weeks compared to 77 mL for placebo (p<0.0001)  with the benefit versus placebo sustained through week 52 (p=0.0003)  both of which were key secondary endpoints.Dupixent met all endpoints tested in the hierarchy  including improvement in patient-reported health-related quality of life as measured by St. George’s Respiratory Questionaire (SGRQ) and reduction in the severity of respiratory symptoms of COPD as measured by Evaluation Respiratory Symptoms: COPD (E-RS: COPD) Scale.The safety results were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. Overall rates of adverse events (AE) were 77% for Dupixent and 76% for placebo. AEs more commonly observed with Dupixent compared to placebo included headache (8.1% Dupixent  6.8% placebo)  diarrhea (5.3% Dupixent  3.6% placebo) and back pain (5.1% Dupixent  3.4% placebo). AEs more commonly observed with placebo compared to Dupixent included upper respiratory tract infection (9.8% placebo  7.9% Dupixent)  hypertension (6.0% placebo  3.6% Dupixent) and COVID-19 (5.7% placebo  4.1% Dupixent). AEs leading to deaths were balanced between the two arms (1.7% placebo  1.5% Dupixent).Detailed efficacy and safety results from this trial will be presented in a future scientific forum.The broader Sanofi and Regeneron COPD clinical research program includes Phase 3 trials with itepekimab  a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits interleukin-33 (IL-33). Itepekimab received Fast Track Designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in January 2023 for the treatment of COPD in patients who do not currently smoke. Data from this pivotal program is expected in 2025.The safety and efficacy of Dupixent and itepekimab in COPD have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About the Dupixent COPD Phase 3 Trial ProgramBOREAS is one of two pivotal trials in the Dupixent COPD program. The randomized  Phase 3  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in 939 adults who were current or former smokers aged 40 to 80 years with moderate-to-severe COPD. All patients in the trial had evidence of type 2 inflammation  as measured by blood eosinophils ≥300 cells/µL. During the 52-week treatment period  patients received Dupixent or placebo every two weeks  added to triple therapy of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)  long-acting beta agonists  and long-acting muscarinic antagonists. Double maintenance therapy was allowed if ICS was contraindicated.The primary endpoint evaluated the annualized rate of acute moderate or severe COPD exacerbations. Moderate exacerbations were defined as those requiring systemic steroids and/or antibiotics. Severe exacerbations were defined as those: requiring hospitalization; more than a day of observation in an emergency department or urgent care facility; or resulting in death. Key secondary endpoints included change from baseline in lung function (assessed by pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 ) at 12 and 52 weeks; change from baseline at week 52 in SGRQ total score compared to placebo; proportion of patients with SGRQ improvement ≥4 points at week 52; and the change from baseline at 52 weeks in the ERS: COPD Scale symptom scoreThe second  replicate Phase 3 trial of Dupixent in COPD (NOTUS) is ongoing with data expected in 2024.About Sanofi and Regeneron’s COPD Clinical Research ProgramSanofi and Regeneron are motivated to transform the treatment paradigm of COPD by examining the role different types of inflammation play in the disease progression through the investigation of two potentially first-in-class biologics  Dupixent and itepekimab.Dupixent inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and the program focuses on a specific population of people with evidence of type 2 inflammation. Itepekimab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits interleukin-33 (IL-33)  an initiator and amplifier of broad inflammation in COPD. Across both programs  four Phase 3 trials are ongoing and designed to inform next-generation treatments for people with COPD whom might not have other options.About DupixentDupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent  such as atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  prurigo nodularis and eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE).Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP  EoE or prurigo nodularis in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in Europe  the U.S. and Japan. More than 600 000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including pediatric EoE  hand and foot atopic dermatitis  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritus of unknown origin  COPD with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority....About RegeneronRegeneron (NASDAQ: REGN) is a leading biotechnology company that invents  develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

Having dealt with the 2022 challenges  Celyad has now positively reinvented itself as a leaner  more agile organization. We believe that Celyad is well prepared and has the relevant unique assets and know how to create significant shareholder value in the next few years.”Operational highlightsSince late 2022  the Company has implemented a differentiated and innovative strategy  increasing its R&D efforts in areas of expertise where it believes it can leverage the differentiated nature of its platform technology and continue to bolster its intellectual property (IP) estate; andThe Company will continue to explore options to tackle the major current limitations of CAR T-cell therapies through development of its dual targeting CARs with NKG2D capabilities  B7-H6 targeting immunotherapies and multiplexing approach of short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs).Upcoming Anticipated MilestonesThe Company will provide an update on its shRNA multiplexing and dual CAR platforms and business development in the first half of 2023;The Company will take part in the World Oncology Cell Therapy Congress in Boston  US (25-26 April 2023)  as well as in the Immuno-Oncology summit in London (20-22 June 2023);The Company anticipates the arrival of a new CEO in the first half of 2023; andWe anticipate fundraising in the first half of 2023.Full Year 2022 Financial ReviewAs of December 31  2022  the Company had cash and cash equivalents of €12.4 million ($13.3 million).The Company projects that its existing cash and cash equivalents should be sufficient to fund operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the fourth quarter of 2023.After due consideration of detailed budgets and estimated cash flow forecasts for the years 2023 and 2024  the Company projects that its existing cash and cash equivalents will not be sufficient to fund its estimated operating and capital expenditures over at least the next 12 months from the date that the financial statements are issued.The Company is currently evaluating different financing options to obtain the required funding to extend the Company’s cash runway beyond 12 months from the date the financial statements are issued.Key financial figures for full-year 2022  compared with full-year 2021  are summarized below:Selected key financial figures (€ millions) Full year 2022 Full year 2021 Revenue - - Research and development expenses (18.9) (20.8) General and administrative expenses (10.5) (9.9) Change in fair value of contingent consideration 14.7 0.8 Impairment of Oncology intangible assets (35.1) - Other income/(expenses) 9.0 3.4 Operating loss (40.9) (26.4) Loss for the period/year (40.9) (26.5) Net cash used in operations (28.0) (26.6) Treasury position(1) 12.4 30.0(1) “Treasury position” is an alternative performance measure determined by adding Short-term investments and Cash and cash equivalents from the statement of financial position prepared in accordance with IFRS. The purpose of this measure by Management is to identify the level of cash available internally (excluding external sources of financing) within 12 months.The Company’s license and collaboration agreements generated no revenue in 2022 and in 2021.Research and Development (R&D) expenses were €18.9 million in 2022 as compared to €20.8 million in 2021  a year-over-year decrease of €1.8 million. The decrease in the Company’s R&D expenses is primarily driven by the Company’s decision to discontinue some of preclinical and in process development costs after the Company’s decision to adopt and implement a new business strategy over the last few months of 2022  as well as a decrease of the expenses associated with share-based payments (non-cash expenses) related to the warrant plan offered to our employees and directors.General and Administrative (G&A) expenses were €10.5 million in 2022 as compared to €9.9 million in 2021  an increase of €0.6 million. This increase is primarily related to higher insurances costs and consulting fees partially compensated by the decrease of the expenses associated with the share-based payments (non-cash expenses) related to the warrants plan offered to our employees and directors.The fair value adjustment (€14.7 million) relating to the contingent consideration and other financial liabilities as of December 31  2022  is mainly driven by the full reversal of the liability. This liability is a result of business combination accounting (IFRS3) which requires the liability to be recorded unless the possibility of any outflow is remote.This impairment comes as a result of the Company’s strategic shift in focus away from clinical development and the early stage nature of the implementation of the Celyad 2.0 strategy  which involves shifting from an organization focused on clinical development to one prioritizing R&D discovery and the monetization of its intellectual property (IP) portfolio through partnerships  collaborations and license agreements. To date  no effective sublicence contract nor collaboration contract has been entered into  and as a result there is uncertainty as to the timing and amount of associated short  medium and long term revenues.Given this uncertainty  and per accounting standards  the Company recognizes a full impairment loss on the remaining value of goodwill  In Process Research and Development  and Horizon Discovery’s shRNA platform  resulting in a non-cash impairment of €35.1 million on a consolidated basis for the financial year ended December 31  2022.This accounting conclusion  which reflects the Company’s financial situation as of December 31  2022  does not affect Management’s commitment to continue in its efforts to pursue the potential monetization of the Company’s IP. If and when such a firm sublicense or collaboration contract occurs and hence increases the probability of revenue  the Management will estimate the reversal of the impairment which will be limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount along with the remeasurement of the related contingent liability.The Company’s other income is principally associated with grants received from the Walloon Region mainly in the form of recoverable cash advances (RCAs) and R&D tax credit income as well as the gain on sale of the CTMU activities:Grant income (RCAs): additional grant income has been recognized in 2022 on grants in the form of RCAs. According to IFRS standards  the Company has earned grants for the period amounting to €1.6 million  out of which €0.5 million is accounted for as a financial liability and the remaining €1.1 million as a grant income;Grant income (Others): additional grant income has been recognized in 2022 on grants received and from the regional government (for €0.9 million)  not referring to RCAs and not subject to reimbursement;With respect to R&D tax credit  the current year income is €0.5 million; andGain on sale of CTMU activities (for €5.2 million) results from the terms of the asset purchase agreement between Celyad Oncology and Cellistic under which Cellistic agreed to acquire Celyad Oncology’s Manufacturing Business Unit for a total consideration of €6.0 million.Net loss for the year ended December 31  2022 was €40.9 million  or €1.81 per share  compared to a net loss of €26.5 million  or €1.70 per share  for the same period in 2021. As noted above  the increase in net loss between periods was primarily due to the non-cash impairment adjustment on the Oncology intangible assets.Net cash used in operations for the year ended December 31  2022  which excludes non-cash effects  amounted to €28.0 million  which is in line with net cash used in operations of €26.6 million for the year ended December 31  2021.The net assets of the Company as of December 31  2022  on a BE-GAAP non-consolidated basis  have fallen below half of the Company’s capital. As a result  in accordance with Article 7:228 of the Belgian Code for Companies and Associations  the Board of Directors plans to submit for a vote  at its May 5  2023 shareholders’ meeting  its business plan including a proposal to continue the Company’s activities. The Board of Directors will publish a detailed report regarding this proposal on or around April 3  2023  together with the convocation with proposed resolutions for the shareholders’ meeting.Annual Report 2022The Annual Report for the year ended December 31  2022 will be published on March 23  2023  and will be available on the Company’s website  www.celyad.com.

Recurring operating income (REBIT)(1) amounted to a loss of €4.9 million in 2022  a €17.8 million decrease compared with the €12.8 million profit of 2021. There were two main reasons for the decline. First  Cegedim Santé recruited large numbers of new hires to keep pace with its growth (notably in sales  support staff  and R&D)  which caused its REBIT(1) to fall by €9.9 million year on year. Second  international business REBIT(1) fell by €8.1 million year on year. Sales were unable to compensate for the loss of Boots as a client in the pharmacy segment in the UK and  as expected  the lack of a window for marketing solutions for doctors in the UK (governed by the NHS).

Highlights To the best of the company’s knowledge  there were no events or changes during 2022 that would materially alter the Group’s financial situation. Investment and strategic partnership between Cegedim and 3 social protection companies On May 16  2022  Cegedim Group and social protection companies Malakoff Humanis  Groupe VYV  and PRO BTP Groupe announced that they had finalized the strategic partnership they began negotiating on March 1  2022. This strategic partnership will advance the goals laid out by the French government in its Ma Santé 2022 plan. The partnership will draw on the recognized expertise of Cegedim  Malakoff Humanis  Groupe VYV  and PRO BTP  who all share the goal of improving patients’ access to care and making the course of care as smooth as possible. To this end  Malakoff Humanis  Groupe VYV  and PRO BTP Groupe—who together represent 25 million beneficiaries in France—subscribed a reserved capital increase of €65 million on May 24  2022  and now own 18% of the shares of Cegedim Santé. Cegedim Santé houses all of Cegedim Group’s software products and services for doctors and allied health professionals in France  covering the care pathway from online appointment scheduling to management of patient records  invoicing  and teleconsultation. In addition  its Resip subsidiary supplies information on medications and medical devices.The deal values Cegedim Santé at €360.9 million. As part of the deal  Cegedim Santé acquired Groupe VYV subsidiary MesDocteurs  a telehealth solution pioneer and one of the originators of 24/7 telemedicine. Acquisition of Laponi On June 21  2022  Cegedim SRH acquired Laponi  an innovative solution for managing absenteeism in real time. Laponi  a French startup founded in 2016  has successfully developed a digital SaaS platform that lets companies ask internal and external employees to cover shifts when someone is absent. The Laponi solution is easy to use and alerts employees in real time about tasks that need to be done. Employees are then free to choose tasks while boosting their income. The acquisition enhances Cegedim SRH’s TeamsRH HRIS platform. As a standalone component in Cegedim SRH’s portfolio  Laponi will be able to help solve absenteeism issues at the company’s 400 clients  and its solution will benefit from Cegedim SRH’s technical and financial resources as well as its sales force. The company is profitable and began contributing to the Group’s consolidation scope in the third quarter of 2022. Acquisition of Sedia On July 19  2022  Cegedim e-business rounded out its Hospitalis offering by acquiring Sedia  which has specialized in software that tracks medical instrumentation usage since 1985. Thanks to this acquisition  Hospitalis now offers a medical device and implantable medical device (MD/IMD) tracking service. The service is responsible for 900 000 scans annually and has tracked more than 8 million IMDs. The newest component in the Hospitalis range  Sedia offers health  financial  and logistical tracking of MD/IMDs that are on consignment or have been lent or purchased outright. Sedia is profitable and began contributing to the Group’s consolidation scope in the third quarter of 2022. Acquisition of Clinityx On July 28  2022  Cegedim strengthened its position in the real-world data sector by acquiring 70% of Clinityx. Clinityx a health start-up founded in 2018  aims to make real-word data research easier by providing a robust scientific  technical  and regulatory environment. The company partners with academic establishments to build data warehouses paired with the SNDS  the French administrative healthcare database  enriching the health data and ensuring their good governance and security. It also provides consulting services and manages all aspects of real-world studies from protocol design to final report  using data from its own warehouses  the SNDS  and other databases. Clinityx is profitable and began contributing to the Group’s consolidation scope in the third quarter of 2022. Healthcare Gateway Limited divestment In October 2022  In Practice Systems Ltd  which is 100% owned by Cegedim SA  sold all of its shares in the UK company Healthcare Gateway Limited (HGL). Prior to the sale  the 50% non-controlling stake in HGL had been consolidated using the equity method. Euris litigation Cegedim  jointly with IQVIA (formerly IMS Health)  is being sued by Euris for unfair competition. Cegedim has asked the court to dismiss the case against the Group. On December 17  2018  the Paris Commercial Court granted Cegedim’s request  which IQVIA then appealed. On December 8  2021  the Court of Appeals upheld the judgement in favor of Cegedim. That ruling is currently under appeal. After consulting its external legal counsel  the Group decided not to set aside any provisions. Tax On February 21  2018  Cegedim SA received official notice that the French tax authorities planned to perform an audit of its financial statements for the period from January 1  2015  to December 31  2016. After consultation with its lawyers and based on ample precedent  the Group believes that the adjustment related to the use of tax-loss carryforwards is unwarranted and continues to explore its options to appeal the decision. On October 21  2021  Cegedim SA received official notice that the French tax authorities planned to perform an audit of its financial statements for the period from January 1  2019  to December 31  2020. That audit has not resulted in any adjustments other than those the Group is already appealing. As part of this process  in the first half of 2022 Cegedim SA received a notice of collection and paid a total of €12.1 million in respect of tax losses used through 2020 and a €0.4 million late payment penalty. The corresponding entry for these payments is not in the taxes line of the income statement  but rather the deferred tax assets line of the balance sheet  as we expect these sums to be repaid once the dispute has been resolved in our favor. Furthermore  as the Group’s accounting method and legal arguments are sound  it continues to record the disputed tax losses as an asset equal to €20 million in deferred tax assets on the balance sheet. In the event of an unfavorable ruling  based on the deferred tax assets used as of December 31  2022  Cegedim faces a maximum risk of €23 million  of which it has already paid €12.1 million  and the cancellation of €20 million in deferred tax assets  which would not entail any cash disbursement. Cegedim believes that the risk of an unfavorable ruling is small and plans to continue using the remaining disputed deferred tax assets. Thus  if the ruling is ultimately unfavorable  the maximum risk in terms of a reversing entry in the tax line of the accounts will increase  but the impact on the cash position would still be more modest  as the Group continues to make periodic payments in respect of the collection notice. Significant transactions and events post December 31  2022 To the best of the company’s knowledge  there were no post-closing events or changes that would materially alter the Group’s financial situation. War in Ukraine The Group does not do business in Russia or Ukraine and has no assets exposed to those countries. Outlook Despite the economic  geopolitical  and monetary uncertainties facing the world  we are confident we will be able to grow our revenues. Based on the currently available information  the Group expects 2023 like-for-like revenue(2) growth to be around 10% relative to 2022. REBIT(1) is expected to grow  notably thanks to the initial returns on investments made in Cegedim Santé and international activities. These targets may need to be revised if there is a resurgence in the Covid-19 pandemic and/or a significant worsening of geopolitical and macroeconomic risks. The Group does not expect to make any significant acquisitions in 2023. --------------- The Audit Committee met on March 22  2023.

The positive scope effect of €4.1 million  or 0.8%  was attributable to the first-time consolidation in Cegedim’s accounts of new acquisitions Kobus Tech  MesDocteurs  Laponi  Sedia  and Clinityx. The positive currency impact was €0.4 million  or 0.1%.Like-for-like(1) revenue increased 5.0% over the period.Recurring operating income(1) fell €14.2 million to €25.7 million in 2022  compared with €39.9 million in 2021. It represented 4.6% of 2022 revenue compared with 7.6% in 2021. The decline was mainly the result of a major recruitment campaign in response to growth at Cegedim Santé  some turbulence affecting the healthcare professionals business in the UK  and sustained R&D investment.-------------(1) Alternative performance indicator. See pages 134-136 of the 2021 Universal Registration Document.(2) At constant scope and exchange rates.(3) As a result of a restatement of provisions following the January 26  2022  revenue announcement  we have adjusted 2022 revenues from €555.6 million to €555.2 million.Other non-recurring operating income and expenses(1) registered a profit of €0.8 million in 2022. The main components include a gain from the sale of shares of Healthcare Gateway Ltd in the UK  which was nearly offset by €4.2 million of restructuring costs and a €10.3 million impairment of non-current assets.Depreciation and amortization expenses increased €5.7 million  chiefly due to an increase in R&D amortization  which rose €4.4 million compared with 2021.EBITDA(1) was down €8.5 million between 2022 and 2021 as a result of higher employee costs (+€24.7 million) and external charges (+€12.5 million).Financial result was -€8.8 million  of which €2.0 million related to IFRS16  €1.6 million better than in 2021  owing to a €0.7 million gain from currencies.Analysis of business trends by divisionin millions of euros Total Software & services Flow Data & Marketing BPO Corporate and others Revenue 2021 524.7 292.0 84.2 98.4 47.3 2.7 2022 555.2 302.0 90.6 106.9 53.0 2.8 Change 5.8% 3.4% 7.5% 8.6% 11.9% 2.0% Recurring operating income 2021 39.9 12.8 11.1 14.6 2.5 -1.1 2022 25.7 -4.9 13.1 17.9 3.0 -3.4 Change -35.7% -138.0% 17.6% 22.9% 20.7% -210.0% Recurring operating margin 2021 7.6% 4.4% 13.2% 14.8% 5.2% -40.3% 2022 4.6% -1.6% 14.4% 16.8% 5.6% -122.5%Software & Services: 2022 revenues rose 3.4%  driven by good performances at Cegedim Santé (+16% in H2) and HR solutions (+10.0% over the full year). Recurring operating income (REBIT)(1) amounted to a loss of €4.9 million in 2022  a €17.8 million decrease compared with the €12.8 million profit of 2021. There were two main reasons for the decline. First  Cegedim Santé recruited large numbers of new hires to keep pace with its growth (notably in sales  support staff  and R&D)  which caused its REBIT(1) to fall by €9.9 million year on year. Second  international business REBIT(1) fell by €8.1 million year on year. Sales were unable to compensate for the loss of Boots as a client in the pharmacy segment in the UK and  as expected  the lack of a window for marketing solutions for doctors in the UK (governed by the NHS).

Corporate and others: 2022 REBIT(1) was a €3.4 million loss  €2.3 million higher than the loss in 2021. The deterioration was caused by an effort to standardize methods for reinvoicing corporate office activities  notably in the areas of R&D and IT systems  as well as lower margins at the offshore corporate centers.---------(1) Alternative performance indicator. See pages 134-136 of the 2021 Universal Registration Document.HighlightsTo the best of the company’s knowledge  there were no events or changes during 2022 that would materially alter the Group’s financial situation.Investment and strategic partnership between Cegedim and 3 social protection companiesOn May 16  2022  Cegedim Group and social protection companies Malakoff Humanis  Groupe VYV  and PRO BTP Groupe announced that they had finalized the strategic partnership they began negotiating on March 1  2022.This strategic partnership will advance the goals laid out by the French government in its Ma Santé 2022 plan. The partnership will draw on the recognized expertise of Cegedim  Malakoff Humanis  Groupe VYV  and PRO BTP  who all share the goal of improving patients’ access to care and making the course of care as smooth as possible.To this end  Malakoff Humanis  Groupe VYV  and PRO BTP Groupe—who together represent 25 million beneficiaries in France—subscribed a reserved capital increase of €65 million on May 24  2022  and now own 18% of the shares of Cegedim Santé. Cegedim Santé houses all of Cegedim Group’s software products and services for doctors and allied health professionals in France  covering the care pathway from online appointment scheduling to management of patient records  invoicing  and teleconsultation. In addition  its Resip subsidiary supplies information on medications and medical devices.The deal values Cegedim Santé at €360.9 million. As part of the deal  Cegedim Santé acquired Groupe VYV subsidiary MesDocteurs  a telehealth solution pioneer and one of the originators of 24/7 telemedicine.Acquisition of LaponiOn June 21  2022  Cegedim SRH acquired Laponi  an innovative solution for managing absenteeism in real time. Laponi  a French startup founded in 2016  has successfully developed a digital SaaS platform that lets companies ask internal and external employees to cover shifts when someone is absent. The Laponi solution is easy to use and alerts employees in real time about tasks that need to be done. Employees are then free to choose tasks while boosting their income. The acquisition enhances Cegedim SRH’s TeamsRH HRIS platform.As a standalone component in Cegedim SRH’s portfolio  Laponi will be able to help solve absenteeism issues at the company’s 400 clients  and its solution will benefit from Cegedim SRH’s technical and financial resources as well as its sales force.The company is profitable and began contributing to the Group’s consolidation scope in the third quarter of 2022.Acquisition of SediaOn July 19  2022  Cegedim e-business rounded out its Hospitalis offering by acquiring Sedia  which has specialized in software that tracks medical instrumentation usage since 1985. Thanks to this acquisition  Hospitalis now offers a medical device and implantable medical device (MD/IMD) tracking service. The service is responsible for 900 000 scans annually and has tracked more than 8 million IMDs. The newest component in the Hospitalis range  Sedia offers health  financial  and logistical tracking of MD/IMDs that are on consignment or have been lent or purchased outright.Sedia is profitable and began contributing to the Group’s consolidation scope in the third quarter of 2022.Acquisition of ClinityxOn July 28  2022  Cegedim strengthened its position in the real-world data sector by acquiring 70% of Clinityx.Clinityx a health start-up founded in 2018  aims to make real-word data research easier by providing a robust scientific  technical  and regulatory environment. The company partners with academic establishments to build data warehouses paired with the SNDS  the French administrative healthcare database  enriching the health data and ensuring their good governance and security. It also provides consulting services and manages all aspects of real-world studies from protocol design to final report  using data from its own warehouses  the SNDS  and other databases.Clinityx is profitable and began contributing to the Group’s consolidation scope in the third quarter of 2022.Healthcare Gateway Limited divestmentIn October 2022  In Practice Systems Ltd  which is 100% owned by Cegedim SA  sold all of its shares in the UK company Healthcare Gateway Limited (HGL). Prior to the sale  the 50% non-controlling stake in HGL had been consolidated using the equity method.Euris litigationCegedim  jointly with IQVIA (formerly IMS Health)  is being sued by Euris for unfair competition. Cegedim has asked the court to dismiss the case against the Group. On December 17  2018  the Paris Commercial Court granted Cegedim’s request  which IQVIA then appealed. On December 8  2021  the Court of Appeals upheld the judgement in favor of Cegedim. That ruling is currently under appeal.After consulting its external legal counsel  the Group decided not to set aside any provisions.TaxOn February 21  2018  Cegedim SA received official notice that the French tax authorities planned to perform an audit of its financial statements for the period from January 1  2015  to December 31  2016. After consultation with its lawyers and based on ample precedent  the Group believes that the adjustment related to the use of tax-loss carryforwards is unwarranted and continues to explore its options to appeal the decision. On October 21  2021  Cegedim SA received official notice that the French tax authorities planned to perform an audit of its financial statements for the period from January 1  2019  to December 31  2020. That audit has not resulted in any adjustments other than those the Group is already appealing.As part of this process  in the first half of 2022 Cegedim SA received a notice of collection and paid a total of €12.1 million in respect of tax losses used through 2020 and a €0.4 million late payment penalty. The corresponding entry for these payments is not in the taxes line of the income statement  but rather the deferred tax assets line of the balance sheet  as we expect these sums to be repaid once the dispute has been resolved in our favor. Furthermore  as the Group’s accounting method and legal arguments are sound  it continues to record the disputed tax losses as an asset equal to €20 million in deferred tax assets on the balance sheet.In the event of an unfavorable ruling  based on the deferred tax assets used as of December 31  2022  Cegedim faces a maximum risk of €23 million  of which it has already paid €12.1 million  and the cancellation of €20 million in deferred tax assets  which would not entail any cash disbursement.Cegedim believes that the risk of an unfavorable ruling is small and plans to continue using the remaining disputed deferred tax assets. Thus  if the ruling is ultimately unfavorable  the maximum risk in terms of a reversing entry in the tax line of the accounts will increase  but the impact on the cash position would still be more modest  as the Group continues to make periodic payments in respect of the collection notice.Significant transactions and events post December 31  2022To the best of the company’s knowledge  there were no post-closing events or changes that would materially alter the Group’s financial situation.War in UkraineThe Group does not do business in Russia or Ukraine and has no assets exposed to those countries.OutlookDespite the economic  geopolitical  and monetary uncertainties facing the world  we are confident we will be able to grow our revenues. Based on the currently available information  the Group expects 2023 like-for-like revenue(2) growth to be around 10% relative to 2022.REBIT(1) is expected to grow  notably thanks to the initial returns on investments made in Cegedim Santé and international activities.These targets may need to be revised if there is a resurgence in the Covid-19 pandemic and/or a significant worsening of geopolitical and macroeconomic risks.The Group does not expect to make any significant acquisitions in 2023.---------------The Audit Committee met on March 22  2023. The Board of Directors  chaired by Jean-Claude Labrune  met on March 23  2023  and approved the consolidated financial statements at December 31  2022.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced the primary and all key secondary endpoints were met in a Phase 3 trial evaluating the investigational use of Dupixent® (dupilumab) compared to placebo in adults currently on maximal standard-of-care inhaled therapy (triple therapy) with uncontrolled chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and evidence of type 2 inflammation. Dupixent is the first and only biologic to demonstrate a clinically meaningful and highly significant reduction (30%) in moderate or severe acute exacerbations of COPD (rapid and acute worsening of respiratory symptoms) over 52 weeks  while also demonstrating significant improvements in lung function  quality of life and COPD respiratory symptoms.“COPD is an urgent global health concern and a notoriously difficult-to-treat disease due to its heterogeneity  with no novel treatments approved in more than a decade ” said George D. Yancopoulos  M.D.  Ph.D.  President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron  and a principal inventor of Dupixent. “In this landmark Phase 3 trial  patients with uncontrolled COPD achieved clinical outcomes with Dupixent at a magnitude never before seen with a biologic. These results also validate the role type 2 inflammation plays in driving COPD in these patients  advancing the scientific community’s understanding of the underlying biology of this disease. We look forward to discussing these exciting results with regulatory authorities.”COPD is a life-threatening respiratory disease that damages the lungs and causes progressive lung function decline. Symptoms include persistent cough and breathlessness that may not only impair the ability to perform routine daily activities  but can also lead to anxiety  depression and sleep disturbances. COPD is also associated with a significant health and economic burden due to recurrent acute exacerbations that require systemic corticosteroid treatment and/or lead to hospitalization or even death. Smoking is a key risk factor for COPD  but even individuals who quit smoking can still develop the disease. In the U.S. alone  approximately 300 000 people live with uncontrolled COPD with type 2 inflammation.“Change cannot come quick enough for people living with uncontrolled COPD  but unfortunately  many investigational treatments have failed to demonstrate significant clinical outcomes leaving these vulnerable patients with limited treatment options. We took a bold approach with our direct to Phase 3 program  shaving years off standard clinical development timelines ” said Dietmar Berger  M.D.  Ph.D.  Head of Global R&D ad interim at Sanofi and Chief Medical Officer. “We are excited to share these unprecedented and potentially paradigm-shifting clinical results  which may give new hope to patients  caregivers and physicians.”In the BOREAS trial (the first of two Phase 3 trials)  939 adults who were current or former smokers aged 40 to 80 years were randomized to receive Dupixent (n=468) or placebo (n=471) added to maximal standard-of-care inhaled therapy. Patients receiving Dupixent experienced:30% reduction in moderate or severe acute COPD exacerbations over 52 weeks (p=0.0005)  the primary endpoint.Improved lung function from baseline by 160 mL at 12 weeks compared to 77 mL for placebo (p<0.0001)  with the benefit versus placebo sustained through week 52 (p=0.0003)  both of which were key secondary endpoints.Dupixent met all endpoints tested in the hierarchy  including improvement in patient-reported health-related quality of life as measured by the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and reduction in the severity of respiratory symptoms of COPD as measured by Evaluation Respiratory Symptoms: COPD (E-RS: COPD) Scale.The safety results were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. Overall rates of adverse events (AEs) were 77% for Dupixent and 76% for placebo. AEs more commonly observed with Dupixent compared to placebo included headache (8.1% Dupixent  6.8% placebo)  diarrhea (5.3% Dupixent  3.6% placebo) and back pain (5.1% Dupixent  3.4% placebo). AEs more commonly observed with placebo compared to Dupixent included upper respiratory tract infection (9.8% placebo  7.9% Dupixent)  hypertension (6.0% placebo  3.6% Dupixent) and COVID-19 (5.7% placebo  4.1% Dupixent). AEs leading to deaths were balanced between the two arms (1.7% placebo  1.5% Dupixent).Detailed efficacy and safety results from this trial will be presented in a future scientific forum.The broader Sanofi and Regeneron COPD clinical research program includes Phase 3 trials with itepekimab  a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits interleukin-33 (IL-33). Itepekimab received Fast Track Designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in January 2023 for the treatment of COPD in patients who do not currently smoke. Data from this pivotal program is expected in 2025.The safety and efficacy of Dupixent and itepekimab in COPD have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About the Dupixent COPD Phase 3 Trial ProgramBOREAS is one of two pivotal trials in the Dupixent COPD program. The randomized  Phase 3  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in 939 adults who were current or former smokers aged 40 to 80 years with moderate-to-severe COPD. All patients in the trial had evidence of type 2 inflammation  as measured by blood eosinophils ≥300 cells/µL. During the 52-week treatment period  patients received Dupixent or placebo every two weeks added to a triple therapy of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)  long-acting beta agonists  and long-acting muscarinic antagonists. Double maintenance therapy was allowed if ICS was contraindicated.The primary endpoint evaluated the annualized rate of acute moderate or severe COPD exacerbations. Moderate exacerbations were defined as those requiring systemic steroids and/or antibiotics. Severe exacerbations were defined as those: requiring hospitalization; more than a day of observation in an emergency department or urgent care facility; or resulting in death. Key secondary endpoints included: change from baseline in lung function (assessed by pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume [FEV 1 ]) at 12 and 52 weeks; change from baseline at 52 weeks in SGRQ total score compared to placebo; the proportion of patients with SGRQ improvement ≥4 points at 52 weeks; and the change from baseline at 52 weeks in the ERS: COPD Scale symptom score.The second  replicate Phase 3 trial of Dupixent in COPD (NOTUS) is ongoing with data expected in 2024.About Regeneron and Sanofi’s COPD Clinical Research ProgramRegeneron and Sanofi are motivated to transform the treatment paradigm of COPD by examining the role different types of inflammation play in the disease progression through the investigation of two potentially first-in-class biologics  Dupixent and itepekimab.Dupixent inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and the program focuses on a specific population of people with evidence of type 2 inflammation. Itepekimab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits interleukin-33 (IL-33)  an initiator and amplifier of broad inflammation in COPD. Across both programs  four Phase 3 trials are ongoing and designed to inform next-generation treatments for people with COPD who might not have other options.About DupixentDupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent  such as atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) and prurigo nodularis.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP  EoE or prurigo nodularis in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in Europe  the U.S. and Japan. More than 600 000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create a substantial proportion of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Dupixent  Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent® (alirocumab)  Kevzara® (sarilumab)  Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb® (atoltivimab  maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including pediatric EoE  chronic inducible urticaria-cold  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritus of unknown origin  COPD with evidence of type 2 inflammation  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. INDICATIONSDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe eczema (atopic dermatitis or AD) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies.

Recurring operating income (REBIT)(1) amounted to a loss of €4.9 million in 2022  a €17.8 million decrease compared with the €12.8 million profit of 2021. There were two main reasons for the decline. First  Cegedim Santé recruited large numbers of new hires to keep pace with its growth (notably in sales  support staff  and R&D)  which caused its REBIT(1) to fall by €9.9 million year on year. Second  international business REBIT(1) fell by €8.1 million year on year. Sales were unable to compensate for the loss of Boots as a client in the pharmacy segment in the UK and  as expected  the lack of a window for marketing solutions for doctors in the UK (governed by the NHS).

Corporate and others: 2022 REBIT(1) was a €3.4 million loss  €2.3 million higher than the loss in 2021. The deterioration was caused by an effort to standardize methods for reinvoicing corporate office activities  notably in the areas of R&D and IT systems  as well as lower margins at the offshore corporate centers. --------- (1) Alternative performance indicator. See pages 134-136 of the 2021 Universal Registration Document. Highlights To the best of the company’s knowledge  there were no events or changes during 2022 that would materially alter the Group’s financial situation. Investment and strategic partnership between Cegedim and 3 social protection companies On May 16  2022  Cegedim Group and social protection companies Malakoff Humanis  Groupe VYV  and PRO BTP Groupe announced that they had finalized the strategic partnership they began negotiating on March 1  2022. This strategic partnership will advance the goals laid out by the French government in its Ma Santé 2022 plan. The partnership will draw on the recognized expertise of Cegedim  Malakoff Humanis  Groupe VYV  and PRO BTP  who all share the goal of improving patients’ access to care and making the course of care as smooth as possible. To this end  Malakoff Humanis  Groupe VYV  and PRO BTP Groupe—who together represent 25 million beneficiaries in France—subscribed a reserved capital increase of €65 million on May 24  2022  and now own 18% of the shares of Cegedim Santé. Cegedim Santé houses all of Cegedim Group’s software products and services for doctors and allied health professionals in France  covering the care pathway from online appointment scheduling to management of patient records  invoicing  and teleconsultation. In addition  its Resip subsidiary supplies information on medications and medical devices.The deal values Cegedim Santé at €360.9 million. As part of the deal  Cegedim Santé acquired Groupe VYV subsidiary MesDocteurs  a telehealth solution pioneer and one of the originators of 24/7 telemedicine. Acquisition of Laponi On June 21  2022  Cegedim SRH acquired Laponi  an innovative solution for managing absenteeism in real time. Laponi  a French startup founded in 2016  has successfully developed a digital SaaS platform that lets companies ask internal and external employees to cover shifts when someone is absent. The Laponi solution is easy to use and alerts employees in real time about tasks that need to be done. Employees are then free to choose tasks while boosting their income. The acquisition enhances Cegedim SRH’s TeamsRH HRIS platform. As a standalone component in Cegedim SRH’s portfolio  Laponi will be able to help solve absenteeism issues at the company’s 400 clients  and its solution will benefit from Cegedim SRH’s technical and financial resources as well as its sales force. The company is profitable and began contributing to the Group’s consolidation scope in the third quarter of 2022. Acquisition of Sedia On July 19  2022  Cegedim e-business rounded out its Hospitalis offering by acquiring Sedia  which has specialized in software that tracks medical instrumentation usage since 1985. Thanks to this acquisition  Hospitalis now offers a medical device and implantable medical device (MD/IMD) tracking service. The service is responsible for 900 000 scans annually and has tracked more than 8 million IMDs. The newest component in the Hospitalis range  Sedia offers health  financial  and logistical tracking of MD/IMDs that are on consignment or have been lent or purchased outright. Sedia is profitable and began contributing to the Group’s consolidation scope in the third quarter of 2022. Acquisition of Clinityx On July 28  2022  Cegedim strengthened its position in the real-world data sector by acquiring 70% of Clinityx. Clinityx a health start-up founded in 2018  aims to make real-word data research easier by providing a robust scientific  technical  and regulatory environment. The company partners with academic establishments to build data warehouses paired with the SNDS  the French administrative healthcare database  enriching the health data and ensuring their good governance and security. It also provides consulting services and manages all aspects of real-world studies from protocol design to final report  using data from its own warehouses  the SNDS  and other databases. Clinityx is profitable and began contributing to the Group’s consolidation scope in the third quarter of 2022. Healthcare Gateway Limited divestment In October 2022  In Practice Systems Ltd  which is 100% owned by Cegedim SA  sold all of its shares in the UK company Healthcare Gateway Limited (HGL). Prior to the sale  the 50% non-controlling stake in HGL had been consolidated using the equity method. Euris litigation Cegedim  jointly with IQVIA (formerly IMS Health)  is being sued by Euris for unfair competition. Cegedim has asked the court to dismiss the case against the Group. On December 17  2018  the Paris Commercial Court granted Cegedim’s request  which IQVIA then appealed. On December 8  2021  the Court of Appeals upheld the judgement in favor of Cegedim. That ruling is currently under appeal. After consulting its external legal counsel  the Group decided not to set aside any provisions. Tax On February 21  2018  Cegedim SA received official notice that the French tax authorities planned to perform an audit of its financial statements for the period from January 1  2015  to December 31  2016. After consultation with its lawyers and based on ample precedent  the Group believes that the adjustment related to the use of tax-loss carryforwards is unwarranted and continues to explore its options to appeal the decision. On October 21  2021  Cegedim SA received official notice that the French tax authorities planned to perform an audit of its financial statements for the period from January 1  2019  to December 31  2020. That audit has not resulted in any adjustments other than those the Group is already appealing. As part of this process  in the first half of 2022 Cegedim SA received a notice of collection and paid a total of €12.1 million in respect of tax losses used through 2020 and a €0.4 million late payment penalty. The corresponding entry for these payments is not in the taxes line of the income statement  but rather the deferred tax assets line of the balance sheet  as we expect these sums to be repaid once the dispute has been resolved in our favor. Furthermore  as the Group’s accounting method and legal arguments are sound  it continues to record the disputed tax losses as an asset equal to €20 million in deferred tax assets on the balance sheet. In the event of an unfavorable ruling  based on the deferred tax assets used as of December 31  2022  Cegedim faces a maximum risk of €23 million  of which it has already paid €12.1 million  and the cancellation of €20 million in deferred tax assets  which would not entail any cash disbursement. Cegedim believes that the risk of an unfavorable ruling is small and plans to continue using the remaining disputed deferred tax assets. Thus  if the ruling is ultimately unfavorable  the maximum risk in terms of a reversing entry in the tax line of the accounts will increase  but the impact on the cash position would still be more modest  as the Group continues to make periodic payments in respect of the collection notice. Significant transactions and events post December 31  2022 To the best of the company’s knowledge  there were no post-closing events or changes that would materially alter the Group’s financial situation. War in Ukraine The Group does not do business in Russia or Ukraine and has no assets exposed to those countries. Outlook Despite the economic  geopolitical  and monetary uncertainties facing the world  we are confident we will be able to grow our revenues. Based on the currently available information  the Group expects 2023 like-for-like revenue(2) growth to be around 10% relative to 2022. REBIT(1) is expected to grow  notably thanks to the initial returns on investments made in Cegedim Santé and international activities. These targets may need to be revised if there is a resurgence in the Covid-19 pandemic and/or a significant worsening of geopolitical and macroeconomic risks. The Group does not expect to make any significant acquisitions in 2023. --------------- The Audit Committee met on March 22  2023.

This webcast will also be available on the Company’s website. Please refer to this link: https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/n2f4om2yPeter Bühler  Valneva’s Chief Financial Officer  commented  “In 2022  Valneva successfully executed on key strategic objectives despite a difficult economic environment. After achieving clinical and regulatory success  we decided to wind-down our COVID-19 activities and focus on our lead programs. We were agile in reactivating production of our commercial vaccines to capitalize on the travel industry recovery. We also managed to strengthen our cash level and shareholder base  attracting leading investors and maintaining the support of existing shareholders. With close to€290 million in cash  we entered 2023 in a strong position to support expected commercial growth and R&D programs.”Clinical Stage Vaccine CandidatesCHIKUNGUNYA VACCINE CANDIDATE – VLA1553FDA Priority Review of vaccine license application grantedVLA1553 is a live-attenuated  single-dose vaccine candidate against the chikungunya virus (CHIKV)  a mosquito-borne virus that has spread to more than 100 countries with the potential to rapidly expand further. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) issued an epidemiological alert last month as the number of cases and deaths due to chikungunya continues to rise in the Americas5. With no preventive vaccine or specific treatment yet available  chikungunya is considered a major public health threat.Valneva announced last month that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted the filing of a Biologics License Application (BLA)6 for approval of VLA1553 in persons aged 18 years and above and granted priority review for the application7. Under this priority review  VLA1553 has currently been assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) review goal date at the end of August 2023  which is the date by which the FDA intends to take action on the application subject to progress of the BLA review. VLA1553 is currently the only chikungunya vaccine candidate worldwide for which a regulatory review process is underway8 and  if approved  it could become the first chikungunya vaccine available to address this unmet medical need.Valneva’s BLA application follows final pivotal Phase 3 data in March 20229  final lot-to-lot consistency results in May 202210 and positive twelve-month persistence data in December 202211. A clinical study of VLA1553 in adolescents is ongoing in Brazil12  for which Valneva reported enrollment and vaccination completion in February 202313. This trial  conducted by Valneva’s partner Instituto Butantan and funded by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI)  may support future regulatory submissions in this age group  if VLA1553 is initially approved in adults  as well as licensure of the vaccine in Europe and Brazil  which would be the first potential approval for use in an endemic population. Topline results are expected mid-2023.The program received FDA Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy designations in 2018 and 2021  respectively. VLA1553 was also granted PRIority MEdicine (PRIME) designation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2020. Valneva currently plans to make additional regulatory submissions for VLA1553 in the second half of 2023. The sponsor of the first chikungunya vaccine approved in the U.S. is eligible to receive a Priority Review Voucher (PRV)14.LYME DISEASE VACCINE CANDIDATE – VLA15Phase 3 study initiatedValneva and Pfizer are developing VLA15  a Lyme disease vaccine candidate that targets the outer surface protein A (OspA) of Borrelia burgdorferi  the bacterium that causes Lyme disease. VLA15 is a multivalent recombinant protein vaccine that targets six serotypes of Borrelia representing the most common strains found in North America and Europe. VLA15 is the only Lyme disease vaccine program in advanced clinical development today and has received Fast Track designation from the FDA.Valneva and Pfizer reported results for three Phase 2 clinical trials of VLA15 in both adult and pediatric populations  in which high levels of antibodies against all six strains were observed15 16 17. In August 2022  the companies initiated a Phase 3 clinical study  ""Vaccine Against Lyme for Outdoor Recreationists (VALOR)""  to investigate the efficacy  safety and immunogenicity of VLA15 in participants five years of age and older in highly endemic regions in the United States and Europe18.In February 2023  Pfizer  as the study sponsor  decided to discontinue half of the total enrolled participants in the trial following violations of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) at certain clinical trial sites run by a third-party clinical trial site operator19. The clinical trial remains ongoing at sites not operated by the third party. The companies intend to work with regulatory authorities and  as previously announced  aim for Pfizer to potentially maintain the original submission timelines  pending successful completion of the Phase 3 studies and subject to the agreement of these regulatory agencies to proposed modifications of the clinical trial plan.According to the terms of Valneva’s collaboration with Pfizer  Pfizer leads late phase development of VLA15 and  if approved  Pfizer will have sole control over its commercialization with Valneva eligible to receive up to $408 million in milestones  plus royalty payments. In June 2022  the terms of this collaboration were updated  and Pfizer invested €90.5 ($95) million in Valneva as part of an equity subscription agreement20. As per the terms of the collaboration agreement  Valneva received a $25 million milestone payment from Pfizer in 2022 following initiation of the Phase 3 study.Pre-Clinical Vaccine CandidatesValneva continues to progress select pre-clinical assets and focus on strengthening its future clinical pipeline. The Company is currently focused on VLA2112  a vaccine candidate targeting the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)  which is one of the most common human viruses. EBV can cause infectious mononucleosis21 and is strongly associated with the development of several types of cancer22 and multiple sclerosis23. Valneva has also been working on a vaccine candidate targeting the human metapneumovirus (hMPV)  which is a major worldwide respiratory pathogen that causes acute upper and lower respiratory tract infection24 and is currently exploring potential partnering opportunities. Additionally  Valneva initiated pre-clinical work on vaccine candidates targeting parvovirus B19  a virus most commonly causing fifth disease25  and Campylobacter  a bacterium often associated with food poisoning26.Commercial VaccinesJAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS VACCINE (IXIARO®/JESPECT®)IXIARO® is an inactivated Vero cell culture-derived Japanese encephalitis that is the only Japanese encephalitis vaccine licensed and available in the United States  Canada and Europe. IXIARO® is indicated for active immunization against Japanese encephalitis  the most prevalent cause of viral encephalitis in Asia  for adults  adolescents  children and infants aged two months and older.IXIARO®/JESPECT® sales were €41.3 million in 2022 compared to €45.1 million in 2021. This decrease was the result of lower sales to the U.S. Department of Defense. The significant recovery of the private travel markets partly offset this impact  with IXIARO®/JESPECT® private sales reaching €28.8 million in 2022 compared to €7.1 million in 2021.CHOLERA / ETEC27-DIARRHEA VACCINE (DUKORAL®)DUKORAL® is an oral vaccine for the prevention of diarrhea caused by Vibrio cholerae and/or heat-labile toxin producing ETEC28  the leading cause of travelers’ diarrhea. DUKORAL® is authorized for use in the European Union and Australia to protect against cholera  and in Canada  Switzerland  New Zealand and Thailand to protect against cholera and ETEC.DUKORAL® sales increased to €17.3 million in 2022 compared to €2.4 million in 2021  also benefitting from the significant recovery in the private travel markets.SARS-CoV-2 INACTIVATED WHOLE-VIRUS VACCINEValneva’s COVID-19 vaccine  VLA2001  is the only inactivated whole-virus COVID-19 vaccine approved in Europe29 and was the first COVID-19 vaccine to receive a full marketing authorization from the EMA. In addition to its marketing approval in Europe  Valneva’s COVID-19 vaccine received conditional marketing authorization in the United Kingdom30 and emergency use authorization in the United Arab Emirates31 and the Kingdom of Bahrain32. In 2022  sales of VLA2001 to the Kingdom of Bahrain and certain EU Member States amounted to €29.6 million. Valneva will provide additional doses to the Kingdom of Bahrain in 2023 pursuant to the advance purchase agreement signed in December 2021.In July 2022  Valneva entered into an amendment to the purchase agreement originally entered into in November 2021 with the European Commission.33 In light of the reduced order volume of 1.25 million doses  which were delivered to Germany  Austria  Denmark  Finland  and Bulgaria in 2022  Valneva suspended manufacturing of the vaccine in August 2022 and has been reshaping the Company to increase efficiency and focus on its operational and strategic business objectives. The Company is continuing to explore potential additional supply agreements to deploy the remaining eight to ten million doses of inventory. However  these inventories were fully written down as of December 31  2022. Earlier this month  Valneva provided clinical and regulatory updates for VLA200134. VLA2001’s shelf life was notably extended to 21 months compared to 18 months previously. The Company will continue to submit data to further extend it.THIRD-PARTY DISTRIBUTIONValneva distributes certain third-party vaccines in countries where it operates its own marketing and sales infrastructure. In September 2022  Valneva announced a partnership with VBI Vaccines for the marketing and distribution of the only 3-antigen Hepatitis B vaccine  PreHevbri®  in select European markets35.In 2022  Valneva’s third party product sales increased by 72.1% to €26.5 million from €15.4 million in 2021.Full Year 2022 Financial Review(Audited36  consolidated under IFRS)RevenuesValneva’s total revenues were €361.3 million in 2022 compared to €348.1 million in 2021  an increase of 3.8%.Valneva’s total product sales reached €114.8 million in 2022 compared to €63.0 million in 2021  an increase of 82.3%. This was driven by a continued recovery of travel vaccine sales that surpassed expectations (€85.2 million versus guidance of €70 to €80 million) complemented by COVID-19 vaccine sales in Europe and Bahrain (€29.6 million). On a constant exchange rate (CER) basis  product sales increased by 66.7% in 2022 as compared to 2021.IXIARO®/JESPECT® sales were €41.3 million in 2022 compared to €45.1 million in 2021  a decrease of 8.4% (18.6% at CER)  driven by lower sales to the U.S. Department of Defense. This decrease was partly offset by the significant recovery of the private travel markets  with IXIARO®/JESPECT® private sales reaching €28.8 million in 2022 compared to €7.1 million in 2021.DUKORAL® sales were €17.3 million in 2022 compared to €2.4 million in 2021  an increase of 610.3% (629.2% at CER)  also benefitting from the significant recovery in the private travel markets.Third-party product sales grew to €26.5 million in 2022 compared to €15.4 million in 2021  an increase of 72.1%. This increase was primarily due to the marketing and distribution partnership with Bavarian Nordic.Other Revenues  including revenues from collaborations  licensing and services  amounted to €246.5 million in 2022 compared to €285.1 million in 2021. These were mainly driven by revenue recognition related to previous COVID-19 vaccine supply agreements.Operating Result and adjusted EBITDACosts of goods and services sold (COGS) were €324.4 million in 2022. The gross margin on commercial product sales amounted to 45.5% compared to 36.5% in 2021. COGS of €15.6 million related to IXIARO® product sales  yielding a product gross margin of 62.2%. COGS of €14.2 million related to DUKORAL® product sales  yielding a product gross margin of 18.2%. The DUKORAL® gross margin was impacted by €8.3 million of impairment charges for Valneva Sweden’s manufacturing facilities following suspension of the COVID-19 vaccine fill and finish activities at that site. Of the remaining COGS in 2022  €16.7 million related to the third-party products distribution business  €267.1 million to the COVID-19 vaccine business and €9.7 million to cost of services. COGS of the COVID-19 vaccine program included effects from the significant reduction of sales volumes to the European Union Member States which resulted in impairment of fixed assets and inventories. In 2021  overall COGS were €187.9 million  of which €162.9 million related to cost of goods and €25.1 million related to cost of services. Research and development expenses amounted to €104.9 million in 2022  compared to €173.3 million in 2021. This decrease was mainly driven by lower clinical trial costs for Valneva’s chikungunya vaccine program advancing towards licensure as well as reduced spend on the COVID-19 program. Marketing and distribution expenses in 2022 amounted to €23.5 million compared to €23.6 million in 2021. Marketing and distribution expenses in 2022 notably included €7.3 million of expenses related to launch preparation costs for Valneva’s chikungunya vaccine candidate  VLA1553  compared to €3.8 million in 2021. In 2022  general and administrative expenses declined to €34.1 million from €47.6 million in 2021. COGS  research and development  marketing and distribution as well as general and administrative expenses benefited from a non-cash accrual adjustment related to the positive effect of the Company’s share price development on employee share-based compensation programs. This income compares to an expense in 2021.Other income  net of other expenses  reduced to €12.2 million in 2022 from €23.0 million in 2021. This decrease was mainly driven by reduced R&D tax credits directly resulting from lower R&D spending and an increase of other expenses related to the provision for the ongoing Vivalis/Intercell merger litigation proceedings.Valneva recorded an operating loss of €113.4 million in 2022 compared to an operating loss of €61.4 million in 2021  of which the COVID-19 program contributed a loss of €42.8 million in 2022 and a profit of €3.9 million in 2021. The other segments represented an operating loss of €70.6 million in 2022 compared to an operating loss of €65.3 million in 2021. Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below) loss in 2022 was €69.2 million compared to an adjusted EBITDA loss of €47.1 million in 2021.Net ResultIn 2022  Valneva generated a net loss of €143.3 million compared to a net loss of €73.4 million in 2021.Finance expense and foreign currency effects in 2022 resulted in a net finance expense of €31.4 million  compared to a net finance expense of €8.6 million in 2021. This was mainly a result of a foreign exchange loss amounting to €12.6 million in 2022  primarily driven by non-cash revaluation results of non-Euro denominated balance sheet positions  compared to a net foreign exchange gain of €8.1 million in 2021. Interest expenses net of interest income were €18.8 million in 2022 compared to €16.7 million in 2021.Cash Flow and LiquidityNet cash used in operating activities amounted to €245.3 million in 2022 compared to €76.9 million of cash generated by operating activities in 2021. Cash outflows in 2022 were mainly related to the operating loss generated in the period and non-cash revenues (cash received in previous periods)  while during 2021 cash inflows mainly resulted from pre-payments received under the vaccine supply agreement signed with the UK government.Cash outflows from investing activities amounted to €29.1 million in 2022 compared to €93.1 million in 2021  both mainly a result of COVID-19-related construction activities across production sites in Scotland and Sweden  as well as equipment purchases.Net cash generated from financing activities amounted to €215.1 million in 2022  which was mainly a result of proceeds from the equity subscription agreement with Pfizer  proceeds from a global offering as well as a draw-down of the credit facility provided by Deerfield Management Company & OrbiMed37. Cash inflows in 2021 amounted to €154.5 million which was mainly a result of proceeds from issuance of new shares in the U.S. initial public offering and European private placement in May as well as an additional global offering in November 2021.Cash and cash equivalents amounted to €289.4 million as at December 31  2022  compared to €346.7 million as at December 31  2021. This included €102.9 million of gross proceeds from an upsized global offering completed in October 2022  €90.5 ($95) million from an equity investment by Pfizer completed in June 2022 as well as drawing of a total $40 million from the Deerfield Management Company & OrbiMed loan agreement.Non-IFRS Financial MeasuresManagement uses and presents IFRS results  as well as the non-IFRS measure of Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate and communicate its performance. While non-IFRS measures should not be construed as alternatives to IFRS measures  management believes non-IFRS measures are useful to further understand Valneva’s current performance  performance trends  and financial condition.Adjusted EBITDA is a common supplemental measure of performance used by investors and financial analysts. Management believes this measure provides additional analytical tools. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings (loss) for the period before income tax  finance income/expense  foreign exchange gain/(loss)  results from investments in associates  amortization  depreciation  and impairment.A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss for the period  which is the most directly comparable IFRS measure  is set forth below:€ in million Twelve months ending December 31 (consolidated per IFRS) 2022 2021 Loss for the period (143.3) (73.4) Add: Income tax expense (1.5) 3.4 Total Finance income (0.3) (0.2) Total Finance expense 19.1 17.0 Foreign exchange gain/(loss) – net 12.6 (8.1) Result from investments in associates - - Amortization 7.0 6.6 Depreciation 14.0 7.7 Impairment 23.2 - Adjusted EBITDA (69.2) (47.1)About Valneva SEValneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development  manufacturing and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need.

After achieving clinical and regulatory success  we decided to wind-down our COVID-19 activities and focus on our lead programs. We were agile in reactivating production of our commercial vaccines to capitalize on the travel industry recovery. We also managed to strengthen our cash level and shareholder base  attracting leading investors and maintaining the support of existing shareholders. With close to€290 million in cash  we entered 2023 in a strong position to support expected commercial growth and R&D programs.”Clinical Stage Vaccine CandidatesCHIKUNGUNYA VACCINE CANDIDATE – VLA1553FDA Priority Review of vaccine license application grantedVLA1553 is a live-attenuated  single-dose vaccine candidate against the chikungunya virus (CHIKV)  a mosquito-borne virus that has spread to more than 100 countries with the potential to rapidly expand further. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) issued an epidemiological alert last month as the number of cases and deaths due to chikungunya continues to rise in the Americas5. With no preventive vaccine or specific treatment yet available  chikungunya is considered a major public health threat.Valneva announced last month that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted the filing of a Biologics License Application (BLA)6 for approval of VLA1553 in persons aged 18 years and above and granted priority review for the application7. Under this priority review  VLA1553 has currently been assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) review goal date at the end of August 2023  which is the date by which the FDA intends to take action on the application subject to progress of the BLA review. VLA1553 is currently the only chikungunya vaccine candidate worldwide for which a regulatory review process is underway8 and  if approved  it could become the first chikungunya vaccine available to address this unmet medical need.Valneva’s BLA application follows final pivotal Phase 3 data in March 20229  final lot-to-lot consistency results in May 202210 and positive twelve-month persistence data in December 202211. A clinical study of VLA1553 in adolescents is ongoing in Brazil12  for which Valneva reported enrollment and vaccination completion in February 202313. This trial  conducted by Valneva’s partner Instituto Butantan and funded by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI)  may support future regulatory submissions in this age group  if VLA1553 is initially approved in adults  as well as licensure of the vaccine in Europe and Brazil  which would be the first potential approval for use in an endemic population. Topline results are expected mid-2023.The program received FDA Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy designations in 2018 and 2021  respectively. VLA1553 was also granted PRIority MEdicine (PRIME) designation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2020. Valneva currently plans to make additional regulatory submissions for VLA1553 in the second half of 2023. The sponsor of the first chikungunya vaccine approved in the U.S. is eligible to receive a Priority Review Voucher (PRV)14.LYME DISEASE VACCINE CANDIDATE – VLA15Phase 3 study initiatedValneva and Pfizer are developing VLA15  a Lyme disease vaccine candidate that targets the outer surface protein A (OspA) of Borrelia burgdorferi  the bacterium that causes Lyme disease. VLA15 is a multivalent recombinant protein vaccine that targets six serotypes of Borrelia representing the most common strains found in North America and Europe. VLA15 is the only Lyme disease vaccine program in advanced clinical development today and has received Fast Track designation from the FDA.Valneva and Pfizer reported results for three Phase 2 clinical trials of VLA15 in both adult and pediatric populations  in which high levels of antibodies against all six strains were observed15 16 17. In August 2022  the companies initiated a Phase 3 clinical study  ""Vaccine Against Lyme for Outdoor Recreationists (VALOR)""  to investigate the efficacy  safety and immunogenicity of VLA15 in participants five years of age and older in highly endemic regions in the United States and Europe18.In February 2023  Pfizer  as the study sponsor  decided to discontinue half of the total enrolled participants in the trial following violations of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) at certain clinical trial sites run by a third-party clinical trial site operator19. The clinical trial remains ongoing at sites not operated by the third party. The companies intend to work with regulatory authorities and  as previously announced  aim for Pfizer to potentially maintain the original submission timelines  pending successful completion of the Phase 3 studies and subject to the agreement of these regulatory agencies to proposed modifications of the clinical trial plan.According to the terms of Valneva’s collaboration with Pfizer  Pfizer leads late phase development of VLA15 and  if approved  Pfizer will have sole control over its commercialization with Valneva eligible to receive up to $408 million in milestones  plus royalty payments. In June 2022  the terms of this collaboration were updated  and Pfizer invested €90.5 ($95) million in Valneva as part of an equity subscription agreement20. As per the terms of the collaboration agreement  Valneva received a $25 million milestone payment from Pfizer in 2022 following initiation of the Phase 3 study.Pre-Clinical Vaccine CandidatesValneva continues to progress select pre-clinical assets and focus on strengthening its future clinical pipeline. The Company is currently focused on VLA2112  a vaccine candidate targeting the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)  which is one of the most common human viruses. EBV can cause infectious mononucleosis21 and is strongly associated with the development of several types of cancer22 and multiple sclerosis23. Valneva has also been working on a vaccine candidate targeting the human metapneumovirus (hMPV)  which is a major worldwide respiratory pathogen that causes acute upper and lower respiratory tract infection24 and is currently exploring potential partnering opportunities. Additionally  Valneva initiated pre-clinical work on vaccine candidates targeting parvovirus B19  a virus most commonly causing fifth disease25  and Campylobacter  a bacterium often associated with food poisoning26.Commercial VaccinesJAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS VACCINE (IXIARO®/JESPECT®)IXIARO® is an inactivated Vero cell culture-derived Japanese encephalitis that is the only Japanese encephalitis vaccine licensed and available in the United States  Canada and Europe. IXIARO® is indicated for active immunization against Japanese encephalitis  the most prevalent cause of viral encephalitis in Asia  for adults  adolescents  children and infants aged two months and older.IXIARO®/JESPECT® sales were €41.3 million in 2022 compared to €45.1 million in 2021. This decrease was the result of lower sales to the U.S. Department of Defense. The significant recovery of the private travel markets partly offset this impact  with IXIARO®/JESPECT® private sales reaching €28.8 million in 2022 compared to €7.1 million in 2021.CHOLERA / ETEC27-DIARRHEA VACCINE (DUKORAL®)DUKORAL® is an oral vaccine for the prevention of diarrhea caused by Vibrio cholerae and/or heat-labile toxin producing ETEC28  the leading cause of travelers’ diarrhea. DUKORAL® is authorized for use in the European Union and Australia to protect against cholera  and in Canada  Switzerland  New Zealand and Thailand to protect against cholera and ETEC.DUKORAL® sales increased to €17.3 million in 2022 compared to €2.4 million in 2021  also benefitting from the significant recovery in the private travel markets.SARS-CoV-2 INACTIVATED WHOLE-VIRUS VACCINEValneva’s COVID-19 vaccine  VLA2001  is the only inactivated whole-virus COVID-19 vaccine approved in Europe29 and was the first COVID-19 vaccine to receive a full marketing authorization from the EMA. In addition to its marketing approval in Europe  Valneva’s COVID-19 vaccine received conditional marketing authorization in the United Kingdom30 and emergency use authorization in the United Arab Emirates31 and the Kingdom of Bahrain32. In 2022  sales of VLA2001 to the Kingdom of Bahrain and certain EU Member States amounted to €29.6 million. Valneva will provide additional doses to the Kingdom of Bahrain in 2023 pursuant to the advance purchase agreement signed in December 2021.In July 2022  Valneva entered into an amendment to the purchase agreement originally entered into in November 2021 with the European Commission.33 In light of the reduced order volume of 1.25 million doses  which were delivered to Germany  Austria  Denmark  Finland  and Bulgaria in 2022  Valneva suspended manufacturing of the vaccine in August 2022 and has been reshaping the Company to increase efficiency and focus on its operational and strategic business objectives. The Company is continuing to explore potential additional supply agreements to deploy the remaining eight to ten million doses of inventory. However  these inventories were fully written down as of December 31  2022. Earlier this month  Valneva provided clinical and regulatory updates for VLA200134. VLA2001’s shelf life was notably extended to 21 months compared to 18 months previously. The Company will continue to submit data to further extend it.THIRD-PARTY DISTRIBUTIONValneva distributes certain third-party vaccines in countries where it operates its own marketing and sales infrastructure. In September 2022  Valneva announced a partnership with VBI Vaccines for the marketing and distribution of the only 3-antigen Hepatitis B vaccine  PreHevbri®  in select European markets35.In 2022  Valneva’s third party product sales increased by 72.1% to €26.5 million from €15.4 million in 2021.Full Year 2022 Financial Review(Audited36  consolidated under IFRS)RevenuesValneva’s total revenues were €361.3 million in 2022 compared to €348.1 million in 2021  an increase of 3.8%.Valneva’s total product sales reached €114.8 million in 2022 compared to €63.0 million in 2021  an increase of 82.3%. This was driven by a continued recovery of travel vaccine sales that surpassed expectations (€85.2 million versus guidance of €70 to €80 million) complemented by COVID-19 vaccine sales in Europe and Bahrain (€29.6 million). On a constant exchange rate (CER) basis  product sales increased by 66.7% in 2022 as compared to 2021.IXIARO®/JESPECT® sales were €41.3 million in 2022 compared to €45.1 million in 2021  a decrease of 8.4% (18.6% at CER)  driven by lower sales to the U.S. Department of Defense. This decrease was partly offset by the significant recovery of the private travel markets  with IXIARO®/JESPECT® private sales reaching €28.8 million in 2022 compared to €7.1 million in 2021.DUKORAL® sales were €17.3 million in 2022 compared to €2.4 million in 2021  an increase of 610.3% (629.2% at CER)  also benefitting from the significant recovery in the private travel markets.Third-party product sales grew to €26.5 million in 2022 compared to €15.4 million in 2021  an increase of 72.1%. This increase was primarily due to the marketing and distribution partnership with Bavarian Nordic.Other Revenues  including revenues from collaborations  licensing and services  amounted to €246.5 million in 2022 compared to €285.1 million in 2021. These were mainly driven by revenue recognition related to previous COVID-19 vaccine supply agreements.Operating Result and adjusted EBITDACosts of goods and services sold (COGS) were €324.4 million in 2022. The gross margin on commercial product sales amounted to 45.5% compared to 36.5% in 2021. COGS of €15.6 million related to IXIARO® product sales  yielding a product gross margin of 62.2%. COGS of €14.2 million related to DUKORAL® product sales  yielding a product gross margin of 18.2%. The DUKORAL® gross margin was impacted by €8.3 million of impairment charges for Valneva Sweden’s manufacturing facilities following suspension of the COVID-19 vaccine fill and finish activities at that site. Of the remaining COGS in 2022  €16.7 million related to the third-party products distribution business  €267.1 million to the COVID-19 vaccine business and €9.7 million to cost of services. COGS of the COVID-19 vaccine program included effects from the significant reduction of sales volumes to the European Union Member States which resulted in impairment of fixed assets and inventories. In 2021  overall COGS were €187.9 million  of which €162.9 million related to cost of goods and €25.1 million related to cost of services. Research and development expenses amounted to €104.9 million in 2022  compared to €173.3 million in 2021. This decrease was mainly driven by lower clinical trial costs for Valneva’s chikungunya vaccine program advancing towards licensure as well as reduced spend on the COVID-19 program. Marketing and distribution expenses in 2022 amounted to €23.5 million compared to €23.6 million in 2021. Marketing and distribution expenses in 2022 notably included €7.3 million of expenses related to launch preparation costs for Valneva’s chikungunya vaccine candidate  VLA1553  compared to €3.8 million in 2021. In 2022  general and administrative expenses declined to €34.1 million from €47.6 million in 2021. COGS  research and development  marketing and distribution as well as general and administrative expenses benefited from a non-cash accrual adjustment related to the positive effect of the Company’s share price development on employee share-based compensation programs. This income compares to an expense in 2021.Other income  net of other expenses  reduced to €12.2 million in 2022 from €23.0 million in 2021. This decrease was mainly driven by reduced R&D tax credits directly resulting from lower R&D spending and an increase of other expenses related to the provision for the ongoing Vivalis/Intercell merger litigation proceedings.Valneva recorded an operating loss of €113.4 million in 2022 compared to an operating loss of €61.4 million in 2021  of which the COVID-19 program contributed a loss of €42.8 million in 2022 and a profit of €3.9 million in 2021. The other segments represented an operating loss of €70.6 million in 2022 compared to an operating loss of €65.3 million in 2021. Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below) loss in 2022 was €69.2 million compared to an adjusted EBITDA loss of €47.1 million in 2021.Net ResultIn 2022  Valneva generated a net loss of €143.3 million compared to a net loss of €73.4 million in 2021.Finance expense and foreign currency effects in 2022 resulted in a net finance expense of €31.4 million  compared to a net finance expense of €8.6 million in 2021. This was mainly a result of a foreign exchange loss amounting to €12.6 million in 2022  primarily driven by non-cash revaluation results of non-Euro denominated balance sheet positions  compared to a net foreign exchange gain of €8.1 million in 2021. Interest expenses net of interest income were €18.8 million in 2022 compared to €16.7 million in 2021.Cash Flow and LiquidityNet cash used in operating activities amounted to €245.3 million in 2022 compared to €76.9 million of cash generated by operating activities in 2021. Cash outflows in 2022 were mainly related to the operating loss generated in the period and non-cash revenues (cash received in previous periods)  while during 2021 cash inflows mainly resulted from pre-payments received under the vaccine supply agreement signed with the UK government.Cash outflows from investing activities amounted to €29.1 million in 2022 compared to €93.1 million in 2021  both mainly a result of COVID-19-related construction activities across production sites in Scotland and Sweden  as well as equipment purchases.Net cash generated from financing activities amounted to €215.1 million in 2022  which was mainly a result of proceeds from the equity subscription agreement with Pfizer  proceeds from a global offering as well as a draw-down of the credit facility provided by Deerfield Management Company & OrbiMed37. Cash inflows in 2021 amounted to €154.5 million which was mainly a result of proceeds from issuance of new shares in the U.S. initial public offering and European private placement in May as well as an additional global offering in November 2021.Cash and cash equivalents amounted to €289.4 million as at December 31  2022  compared to €346.7 million as at December 31  2021. This included €102.9 million of gross proceeds from an upsized global offering completed in October 2022  €90.5 ($95) million from an equity investment by Pfizer completed in June 2022 as well as drawing of a total $40 million from the Deerfield Management Company & OrbiMed loan agreement.Non-IFRS Financial MeasuresManagement uses and presents IFRS results  as well as the non-IFRS measure of Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate and communicate its performance. While non-IFRS measures should not be construed as alternatives to IFRS measures  management believes non-IFRS measures are useful to further understand Valneva’s current performance  performance trends  and financial condition.Adjusted EBITDA is a common supplemental measure of performance used by investors and financial analysts. Management believes this measure provides additional analytical tools. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings (loss) for the period before income tax  finance income/expense  foreign exchange gain/(loss)  results from investments in associates  amortization  depreciation  and impairment.A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss for the period  which is the most directly comparable IFRS measure  is set forth below:€ in million Twelve months ending December 31 (consolidated per IFRS) 2022 2021 Loss for the period (143.3) (73.4) Add: Income tax expense (1.5) 3.4 Total Finance income (0.3) (0.2) Total Finance expense 19.1 17.0 Foreign exchange gain/(loss) – net 12.6 (8.1) Result from investments in associates - - Amortization 7.0 6.6 Depreciation 14.0 7.7 Impairment 23.2 - Adjusted EBITDA (69.2) (47.1)About Valneva SEValneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development  manufacturing and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need.

March 23  2023 /PRNewswire/ -- A new poll on behalf of the Medal of Honor Foundation delivered a clear message that there is a substantial gap between the values Americans see as important and how they believe those same values are taught and lived in society today.Overall  the poll results clearly show a need to regain schools' prominence in values education Tweet this Medal of Honor Foundation | Ipsos poll. Medal of Honor Foundation | Ipsos poll.The survey  conducted by Ipsos  a global research company  found that nearly four in five Americans (79%) believe having strong values and character is important to Americans. Yet  the poll also shows that seven in ten (71%) believe that there is not enough focus on values in American society today. A strong majority of Americans (87%) agree that society would be a better place if we had stronger values  and 77% say that society is less values-oriented than in previous generations.The poll asked respondents about character and values broadly  in addition to their views on the core values most associated with the Medal of Honor  the nation's highest award for valor in combat. They are courage  sacrifice  citizenship  integrity  commitment  and patriotism.The first-ever Medal of Honor Values Survey was released just three days before National Medal of Honor Day  which honors the 3 516 people who have received the award. There are currently 65 living Medal of Honor Recipients  veterans of the Korean and Vietnam Wars and the Global War on Terror.Less emphasis on values and lack of exposure to the right role models are seen as the biggest challenges to youth being able to learn values. Schools no longer figure prominently in values education.Other key findings from the survey are that Americans now see social media as the top place where young people are learning values and that schools are no longer one of the leading places for values to be learned. Additionally  not enough exposure to the right kind of role models is seen as one of the biggest challenges to youth being able to learn values.Respondents rated school (36%) as the second most likely place where they themselves learned values  topped only by home and family (85%). Places of worship (35%) and friends or friends' parents (33%) followed closely.School fell to sixth place (24%) when respondents were asked where young people learn values today. The primary places where young people today learn values  according to those polled  are social media (53%) and home and family (46%)  followed by the Internet (36%)  friends (34%)  and television  media  or entertainment (28%).Nine in ten Americans (91%) believe there are challenges to youth being able to learn values and character traits today.The biggest perceived challenges for youth are less emphasis on values and character and not enough exposure to the right kind of role models (47% each).Overall  the poll results clearly show a need to regain schools' prominence in values education  by providing programs  educational experiences  and role models for students. These are all areas that Medal of Honor Recipients have been delivering since the Congressional Medal of Honor Society was founded in 1958 by Congress.Recipients continue to serve and follow the mission to ""to inspire and stimulate our youth to become worthy citizens of our country"" through outreach  education and preservation programs  including the Congressional Medal of Honor Character Development Program  Medal of Honor Museum  Congressional Medal of Honor Outreach Programs  and the annual Congressional Medal of Honor Citizen Honors Awards for Valor and Service being held on Medal of Honor Day  March 25  in Arlington  Virginia.Medal of Honor Recipient and Congressional Medal of Honor Society President Leroy Petry said  ""Having a strong foundation of values is important no matter who you are or what you do. We look forward to using the data from this poll to enhance our values-centered education and outreach programs.""Medal of Honor Foundation Chairman David McIntyre added  ""This poll shows us that  as a society  we do have our work cut out for us when it comes to strengthening our values  but I believe that the good news is that no group is more worthy of emulation than our nation's Medal of Honor Recipients as we seek champions of strong values and those who can serve as role models.""'Additional key findings of the poll:The poll  which included a sample of 220 active duty and military veterans  found that members of this group (86%) are more likely than the general population to find strong values and character important.When asked to rate the importance of specific values  nine in ten Americans say that integrity (93%)  courage (93%)  commitment (93%)  and citizenship (91%) are very or somewhat important. Slightly less  but a strong majority  nonetheless  say the same of sacrifice (84%) and patriotism (82%).While nearly three in four Americans agree that the Medal of Honor is a very distinctive recognition (74%)  just 23% report being able to name a Recipient of the Medal of Honor. This is compared to 69% who can name an Olympic Gold Medalist  59% who can name a Nobel Peace Prize Recipient  and 55% who can name an Oscar winner.Topline and methodology can be found here.

The ETF seeks to address what Horizon Kinetics sees as one of the most important economic and investment drivers: Inflation  by identifying unique  scalable businesses that have the potential to thrive in an inflationary environment. (For more information about INFBN  please visit https://www.horizonkinetics.com/products/ucits/infbn/).Following the successful launch of our NYSE-listed Inflation Beneficiaries ETF in January 2021 (INFL  please visit https://horizonkinetics.com/products/etf/infl/)  we have heard growing demand for a similar product from our European clients; we are pleased to be able to offer them this differentiated strategy. INFBN seeks to invest in companies that are positioned to benefit in an inflationary environment (though they do not require inflation to perform well). We believe that the world is entering a new era of sustained  structural inflation  due to a variety of factors. The primary divers of this dynamic  namely critical raw material supply underinvestment and ballooning government debts  have been developing for decades.""As we have written for years  indexes typically become concentrated in certain sectors over time  decreasing the diversification they offer to investors. Our Fund is actively managed  and provides critical diversification from the index and asset allocation complex "" said Murray Stahl  Founder  CEO  and Chief Investment Officer at Horizon Kinetics.Story continues""We are pleased to offer our European clients a product that will follow a similar strategy to INFL  emphasizing exposure to hard asset  capital light businesses. We originally launched the strategy for our U.S. clients  but inflation is a global phenomenon which impacts all businesses and investors. The portfolio is designed to provide a full cycle inflation exposure  that has the potential to thrive in a variety of economic scenarios. We believe this is possible because the Fund emphasizes companies that have exposure to inflationary underlying assets  yet do not have high capital intensity  hence earn full cycle strong returns. The Fund also provides exposure to what we believe are the highest quality companies in sectors that are underrepresented in global equity indexes "" added James Davolos  Portfolio Manager.About Horizon Kinetics LLCHorizon Kinetics LLC is the parent holding company of Horizon Kinetics Asset Management LLC  an SEC-registered investment adviser  as well KBD Securities  LLC and Kinetics Funds Distributor LLC  two limited-purpose  SEC-registered broker/dealers and members of FINRA.

For this and other important information  you may obtain the Fund's Prospectus by clicking HERE  the Fund's Prospectus Supplement by clicking HERE  or by contacting 646-495-7333. Read them carefully before investing.The Horizon Kinetics Inflation Beneficiaries UCITS ETF (the ""Fund"") is an actively managed UCITS ETF that seeks long-term growth of capital in excess of inflation. It seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing primarily in domestic and foreign equity securities of companies that are expected to benefit  either directly or indirectly  from rising prices of real assets (i.e.  assets whose value is mainly derived from physical properties such as commodities) such as those whose revenues are expected to increase with inflation without corresponding increases in expenses.The Fund's Ticker is INFLBN and is traded on the Euronext Amsterdam Stock Exchange (EAM) and Euronext Dublin Stock Exchange (XDUB).Investing involves risk  including the possible loss of principal. Shares of any ETF are bought and sold at market price (not NAV)  may trade at a discount or premium to NAV and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. The Fund's investments in securities linked to real assets involve significant risks  including financial  operating  and competitive risks. Investments in securities linked to real assets expose the Fund to potentially adverse macroeconomic conditions  such as a rise in interest rates or a downturn in the economy in which the asset is located.The Fund is non‐diversified  meaning it may concentrate its assets in fewer individual holdings than a diversified fund. Therefore  the Fund is more exposed to individual stock volatility than a diversified fund. Fund holdings and sector allocations are subject to change at any time and should not be considered recommendations to buy or sell any security. The Fund invests in foreign securities which involve greater volatility and political  economic and currency risks and differences in accounting methods. These risks are greater for investments in emerging markets.The Fund may invest in the securities of smaller and mid‐capitalization companies  which may be more volatile than funds that invest in larger  more established companies. The Fund is actively managed and may be affected by the investment adviser's security selections. Diversification does not assure a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market.Sustainable Finance Disclosures Regulation Details: CLICK HEREContact:Agustin Krisnawahjuesa  CFAHorizon Kinetics LLC646-495-7340akrisnawahjuesa@horizonkinetics.comSOURCE: Horizon Kinetics Inflation Beneficiaries UCITS ETFView source version on accesswire.com:https://www.accesswire.com/745086/Horizon-Kinetics-Launches-Inflation-Beneficiaries-UCITS-ETF-INFBN",neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,mixed,0.2,0.1,0.7,True,English,"['Inflation Beneficiaries UCITS ETF', 'Horizon Kinetics', 'INFBN', 'long-term, contrarian, fundamental value investment philosophy', 'The Horizon Kinetics Inflation Beneficiaries UCITS ETF', 'Euronext Amsterdam Stock Exchange', 'Euronext Dublin Stock Exchange', 'Horizon Kinetics Asset Management LLC', 'two limited-purpose, SEC-registered broker/dealers', 'critical raw material supply', 'NYSE-listed Inflation Beneficiaries ETF', 'Kinetics Funds Distributor LLC', 'proprietary research-driven philosophy', 'full cycle inflation exposure', 'Horizon Kinetics LLC', 'SEC-registered investment adviser', 'asset allocation complex', ""Horizon Kinetics' inception"", 'parent holding company', 'Bankers Trust Company', 'adverse macroeconomic conditions', 'Chief Investment Officer', 'sustained, structural inflation', 'unique, scalable businesses', 'U.S. clients', 'high capital intensity', 'foreign equity securities', 'capital light businesses', 'IMPORTANT RISK DISCLOSURES', 'New York City', 'highest quality companies', 'global equity indexes', 'inflationary underlying assets', 'other important information', 'long-term growth', 'hard asset', 'active ETF', 'investment drivers', 'investment boutique', 'investment objectives', 'important economic', 'critical diversification', 'global phenomenon', 'The Fund', 'inflationary environment', 'European clients', 'new era', 'other products', 'growing demand', 'primary divers', 'government debts', 'Murray Stahl', 'economic scenarios', 'James Davolos', 'primary offices', 'White Plains', 'rising prices', 'real assets', 'physical properties', 'corresponding increases', 'possible loss', 'market price', 'Brokerage commissions', 'financial, operating', 'interest rates', 'KBD Securities', 'differentiated strategy', 'similar strategy', 'significant risks', 'competitive risks', 'successful launch', 'similar product', 'strong returns', 'Portfolio Manager', 'Prospectus Supplement', 'INFBN NA', 'ACCESSWIRE', 'March', 'EAM', 'XDUB', 'Firm', '20 years', 'potential', 'horizonkinetics', 'January', 'world', 'variety', 'factors', 'dynamic', 'decades', 'sectors', 'time', 'investors', 'Founder', 'CEO', 'Story', 'members', 'FINRA', '70 employees', 'charges', 'expenses', 'HERE', 'excess', 'domestic', 'commodities', 'revenues', 'Ticker', 'INFLBN', 'Investing', 'principal', 'Shares', 'NAV', 'discount', 'premium', 'investments', 'rise']",2023-03-24,2023-03-24,uk.finance.yahoo.com
