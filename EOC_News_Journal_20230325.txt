(the ""Stock Option Program 2023/2026"")  which materially has the same structure as the stock option programs adopted by the Annual General Meeting in 2020 (""Stock Option Program 2020/2023"") and by the Annual General Meeting 2022 (""Stock Option Program 2022/2025"").The objective of the Stock Option Program 2023/2026 is to link a portion of the employees' remuneration to INVISIO's long-term performance and value creation for the shareholders. Thereby the long-term interests of the employees aligns with the interests of the shareholders. In addition  the Stock Option Program 2023/2026 will be an important tool for INVISIO to recruit  retain and motivate the company's employees and the board considers the program beneficial for both INVISIO and its shareholders in the coming years. Board members elected by the general meeting are not allowed to participate in the Stock Option Program 2023/2026.A. ADOPTION OF THE PROGRAM1. The Stock Option Program 2023/2026 in briefAll INVISIO group employees shall be entitled to participate in the Stock Option Program 2023/2026.Based on performance  position and the employee's importance to the INVISIO group  the employees will be granted stock options which entitle the participants to acquire shares in INVISIO during 2026  subject to the terms and conditions of the Stock Option Program 2023/2026 (the ""Stock Options""). If the participant (i) throughout the entire vesting period of the Stock Option Program 2023/2026  which runs from the allotment of the Stock Option up to and including 8 May 2026 (the ""Vesting Period"")  with certain exceptions  is employed by the INVISIO group and (ii) to the extent the performance based criteria for the Stock Options has been reached during 9 May 2023 – 8 May 2026 (the ""Measurement Period"")  the participants will be entitled to acquire shares in INVISIO during May – June 2026.To ensure INVISIO's undertaking to deliver shares to the participants in the Stock Option Program 2023/2026  the board proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to issue a maximum of 800 000 warrants (each warrant entitles to subscription for one (1) share in INVISIO) to a wholly-owned Danish subsidiary  INVISIO A/S (the ""Subsidiary""). To such extent the performance criteria of the Stock Option Program 2023/2026 is reached  the warrants shall be exercised to deliver shares in INVISIO to the participants in the Stock Option Program 2023/2026.2. CostsPursuant to IFRS 2  the Stock Options are to be recorded as a personnel expense during the Vesting Period and should be reported directly against equity. Based on the assumption of a share price of SEK 220 at the time of allotment and calculated by using the Black & Scholes and Monte Carlo methods  the estimated total reported cost for the Stock Options is approx. SEK 25.1 million for the period 2023/2026.In the event of a positive price trend  social security costs will arise due to the Stock Options. These costs shall be written off during the tenor of the Stock Options based on the value changes of the Stock Options.Based on the assumption that all 800 000 Stock Options will be exercised to acquire new shares in INVISIO on 15 May 2026  and the INVISIO share price increases with 30 per cent and outperforms the SIXPRX Index (see definition below in item 5.5) by 20 percentage points during the Vesting Period  the social security costs are estimated to be approx. SEK 5.7 million. The costs are continuously reviewed during the Vesting Period.3. Dilution and effects on important key ratiosUp to 800 000 Stock Options may be issued to the participants in the program. The maximum number of shares in INVISIO which may be subscribed for in the Stock Option Program 2023/2026 is 800 000  corresponding to an increase of the share capital of a maximum of SEK 800 000. Based on the current number of outstanding shares  the maximum dilution resulting from the Stock Option Program 2023/2026 will be approx. 1.7 per cent of outstanding shares and votes  provided that all Stock Options are exercised to acquire new shares in INVISIO. The total dilution resulting from all Stock Options being exercised to acquire new shares in INVISIO in Stock Option Program 2020/2023  Stock Option Program 2022/2025 and Stock Option Program 2023/2026 is approx. 4.4 per cent based on the number of outstanding shares and votes as of today.The costs and dilution are expected to have only a marginal effect on the key ratios of INVISIO.4. Other share related incentive programsThere are two ongoing share related incentive programs in INVISIO  the Stock Option Program 2020/2023 adopted by the Annual General Meeting 2020 and the Stock Option Program 2022/2025 adopted by the Annual General Meeting 2022.5. Main terms and conditions for the Stock Option Program 2023/20261. Issuance and allotment of Stock OptionsA maximum of 800 000 Stock Options may be allotted to the participants in the Stock Option Program 2023/2026. Allotment will occur on 9 May 2023.1.2. Participants in the program and allocationThe Stock Options may be allocated to all employees who  at the time of allotment  are permanently employed by the INVISIO group  approx. 226 persons. Persons who  at the time of allotment  have resigned from their employment  or who have been dismissed from their employment by INVISIO  will not be granted Stock Options. Future employees  who have not yet commenced their employment at the time of allotment  may  conditioned upon that the employment commences on 1 December 2023 at the latest  be offered to participate in the Stock Option Program 2023/2026 if the board considers it compatible with the objective of the program.The participants may be granted the maximum number of Stock Options as stated below.Category 1 – CEO may be granted a maximum of 24 000 Stock Options.Category 2 – a maximum of five senior executives  may be granted a maximum of 12 000 Stock Options per person.Category 3 – other employees  approx. 220 persons  may be granted a maximum of 6 000 Stock Options per person.Allotment of Stock Options shall be based on inter alia the participant's performance  position and importance for INVISIO.No employee is guaranteed to be granted Stock Options.3. Stock Option price and purchase priceThe granted Stock Options are received free of charge.After the Stock Options have been granted and vested  and to the extent the performance criteria for the Stock Options have been reached  each Stock Option entitles to the acquisition of one (1) share in INVISIO at a price corresponding to the average share price of INVISIO's share during the period 1 April 2023 – 30 April 2023 (the ""Purchase Price""). The average share price shall be calculated as the average for each trading day calculated average volume-weighted price paid for the INVISIO share on Nasdaq Stockholm  round off to the nearest full ten öre whereby five öre shall be round off upwards.4. Vesting conditionsIf  for whatever reason  a participant's employment with the INVISIO group would come to an end before the end of the Vesting Period  the Stock Options will lapse and cannot be exercised. Only if the participant has been employed by the INVISIO group for at least 36 months at the end of the notice period  and:a. the employment is terminated by INVISIO or any of its subsidiaries for any reason other than due to the participant's breach of the employment agreement  orb. the employment is terminated in INVISIO or any of its subsidiaries by the participant due to a significant breach of the employment agreement by INVISIO or any of its subsidiaries the participant shall be entitled to exercise the Stock Options during the Exercise Period.A participant encompassed by items (a)-(b) above shall  with regard to the Stock Options  be treated as if he/she was still employed by the INVISIO group during the entire Vesting Period.5. Performance criteriaThe number of granted Stock Options  which each participant will be entitled to exercise to acquire shares in INVISIO  is dependent on the extent to which the following performance criteria for the Stock Option Program 2023/2026 has been reached:The share price development for the INVISIO share (including paid dividends from INVISIO to its shareholders for the period 1 April 2023 – 30 April 2026) during the Measurement Period compared to the SIX Portfolio Return Index (""SIXPRX"") reference index. (SIXPRX displays the average development (including dividends) on Nasdaq Stockholm adjusted for stock fund placement limitations.)In order for all (100 per cent) of the Stock Options to entitle the participant to acquire shares in INVISIO it is required that the share price development for INVISIO surpasses SIXPRX with 20 percentage points. If the share price development surpasses SIXPRX with 10 percentage points  half (50 per cent) of the participant's Stock Options will entitle the participant to acquire shares in INVISIO. If the share price development for the INVISIO share surpasses SIXPRX with more than 10 but with less than 20 percentage points  the Stock Options will entitle to acquisition of shares in INVISIO on a linear basis between 50 to 100 per cent. If the share price development in INVISIO does not surpasses SIXPRX with 10 percentage points  all (100 per cent) of the Stock Options will lapse.6. ExerciseThe exercise of Stock Options to acquire new shares in INVISIO may  to the extent the performance criteria for the Stock Option Program 2023/2026 is reached and the participant has fulfilled the vesting conditions  occur during the period 15 May – 30 June 2026 (the ""Exercise Period"").The Exercise Period may be postponed if the board deems it suitable.The Stock Options will automatically lapse and may no longer be exercised at the end of the Exercise Period.7. Transfer and pledgingStock Options are non-transferrable and may not be pledged.8. RecalculationAs far as the warrants  which have been issued to secure delivery of shares to the participants in the Stock Option Program 2023/2026  are subject to recalculation according to the terms and conditions for warrants  the Stock Options shall be recalculated accordingly.Recalculation shall take place in the event of e.g. bonus issues  rights issues  reverse share splits and share splits in accordance with the terms and conditions for warrants 2023/2026  which are available on INVISIO's website.9. Change of controlIn the event of a change of control in INVISIO  which inter alia includes that someone  directly or indirectly  owns or controls 50 per cent or more of the votes in INVISIO as well as in certain other events  participants have a right to exercise granted Stock Options in advance  i.e. even during the Vesting Period.10. Preparation and administrationThe Stock Options shall be subject to the provisions of separate agreements with each participant.The board shall be responsible for preparing the agreements with the participants and the administration of the Stock Option Program 2023/2026  with its primary terms and conditions being in accordance with the resolution by the Annual General Meeting. In connection therewith  the board may make adjustments in order to fulfil specific rules or market conditions. Further  the board may make other adjustments  including to resolve to reduce the number of Stock Options which may be exercised to acquire new shares (wholly or partially) for all employees or certain categories of employees which are encompassed by the Stock Option Program 2023/2026  if significant changes occur in the INVISIO group or on the market that the board considers entailing that the conditions for acquisition of new shares in the Stock Option Program 2023/2026 no longer fulfils the objective of the Stock Option Program 2023/2026.B. ISSUANCE OF WARRANTSIn order to secure the delivery of shares pursuant to the Stock Option Program 2023/2026  the board of INVISIO proposes that INVISIO  deviating from the shareholders' preferential rights  issues a maximum of 800 000 warrants  Series 2023/2026  entitling to subscription of new shares in INVISIO as follows.The warrants shall be issued free of charge. Each warrant shall entitle to subscription of one share in INVISIO  thus  the share capital will increase with maximum SEK 800 000 after full exercise of the warrants. With deviation of the shareholders' preferential rights  Invisio A/S shall be entitled to subscribe for the warrants. The warrants shall be subscribed for by 10 May 2023 at the latest. The term of subscription may be extended by the board. The warrants may be exercised for subscription of shares from the day the warrants are registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office up to and including 31 December 2026. The warrants shall have a subscription price at subscription of new share corresponding to the average share price of the INVISIO share during the period 1 April 2023 – 30 April 2023 (i.e. the same price as the Purchase Price  defined in item A). The average share price shall be calculated as the average for each trading day calculated average volume-weighted price paid for the INVISIO share on Nasdaq Stockholm  round off to the nearest full ten öre whereby five öre shall be round off upwards  during a specified period. In the event that a price paid is not available  the bid price listed as the closing price shall be included in the calculation. A day without a listing of a price paid or bid price shall not be included in the calculation. The newly issued shares shall entitle to dividend from the first record date for dividend that occurs after the shares have been registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office. The complete terms and conditions for the warrants are available on INVISIO's website and will be registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and Euroclear Sweden AB.The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights is that the issuance (and the transfer) ensures delivery of shares to the participants in the Stock Option Program 2023/2026.

APPROVAL OF TRANSFER OF WARRANTSThe board proposes that the Subsidiary may transfer/dispose the warrants to the participants or otherwise to third parties for the purpose of delivering shares in INVISIO to the participants in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Stock Option Program 2023/2026.

Thereby the long-term interests of the employees aligns with the interests of the shareholders. In addition  the Stock Option Program 2023/2026 will be an important tool for INVISIO to recruit  retain and motivate the company's employees and the board considers the program beneficial for both INVISIO and its shareholders in the coming years. Board members elected by the general meeting are not allowed to participate in the Stock Option Program 2023/2026.A. ADOPTION OF THE PROGRAM1. The Stock Option Program 2023/2026 in briefAll INVISIO group employees shall be entitled to participate in the Stock Option Program 2023/2026.Based on performance  position and the employee's importance to the INVISIO group  the employees will be granted stock options which entitle the participants to acquire shares in INVISIO during 2026  subject to the terms and conditions of the Stock Option Program 2023/2026 (the ""Stock Options""). If the participant (i) throughout the entire vesting period of the Stock Option Program 2023/2026  which runs from the allotment of the Stock Option up to and including 8 May 2026 (the ""Vesting Period"")  with certain exceptions  is employed by the INVISIO group and (ii) to the extent the performance based criteria for the Stock Options has been reached during 9 May 2023 – 8 May 2026 (the ""Measurement Period"")  the participants will be entitled to acquire shares in INVISIO during May – June 2026.To ensure INVISIO's undertaking to deliver shares to the participants in the Stock Option Program 2023/2026  the board proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to issue a maximum of 800 000 warrants (each warrant entitles to subscription for one (1) share in INVISIO) to a wholly-owned Danish subsidiary  INVISIO A/S (the ""Subsidiary""). To such extent the performance criteria of the Stock Option Program 2023/2026 is reached  the warrants shall be exercised to deliver shares in INVISIO to the participants in the Stock Option Program 2023/2026.2. CostsPursuant to IFRS 2  the Stock Options are to be recorded as a personnel expense during the Vesting Period and should be reported directly against equity. Based on the assumption of a share price of SEK 220 at the time of allotment and calculated by using the Black & Scholes and Monte Carlo methods  the estimated total reported cost for the Stock Options is approx. SEK 25.1 million for the period 2023/2026.In the event of a positive price trend  social security costs will arise due to the Stock Options. These costs shall be written off during the tenor of the Stock Options based on the value changes of the Stock Options.Based on the assumption that all 800 000 Stock Options will be exercised to acquire new shares in INVISIO on 15 May 2026  and the INVISIO share price increases with 30 per cent and outperforms the SIXPRX Index (see definition below in item 5.5) by 20 percentage points during the Vesting Period  the social security costs are estimated to be approx. SEK 5.7 million. The costs are continuously reviewed during the Vesting Period.3. Dilution and effects on important key ratiosUp to 800 000 Stock Options may be issued to the participants in the program. The maximum number of shares in INVISIO which may be subscribed for in the Stock Option Program 2023/2026 is 800 000  corresponding to an increase of the share capital of a maximum of SEK 800 000. Based on the current number of outstanding shares  the maximum dilution resulting from the Stock Option Program 2023/2026 will be approx. 1.7 per cent of outstanding shares and votes  provided that all Stock Options are exercised to acquire new shares in INVISIO. The total dilution resulting from all Stock Options being exercised to acquire new shares in INVISIO in Stock Option Program 2020/2023  Stock Option Program 2022/2025 and Stock Option Program 2023/2026 is approx. 4.4 per cent based on the number of outstanding shares and votes as of today.The costs and dilution are expected to have only a marginal effect on the key ratios of INVISIO.4. Other share related incentive programsThere are two ongoing share related incentive programs in INVISIO  the Stock Option Program 2020/2023 adopted by the Annual General Meeting 2020 and the Stock Option Program 2022/2025 adopted by the Annual General Meeting 2022.5. Main terms and conditions for the Stock Option Program 2023/20261. Issuance and allotment of Stock OptionsA maximum of 800 000 Stock Options may be allotted to the participants in the Stock Option Program 2023/2026. Allotment will occur on 9 May 2023.1.2. Participants in the program and allocationThe Stock Options may be allocated to all employees who  at the time of allotment  are permanently employed by the INVISIO group  approx. 226 persons. Persons who  at the time of allotment  have resigned from their employment  or who have been dismissed from their employment by INVISIO  will not be granted Stock Options. Future employees  who have not yet commenced their employment at the time of allotment  may  conditioned upon that the employment commences on 1 December 2023 at the latest  be offered to participate in the Stock Option Program 2023/2026 if the board considers it compatible with the objective of the program.The participants may be granted the maximum number of Stock Options as stated below.Category 1 – CEO may be granted a maximum of 24 000 Stock Options.Category 2 – a maximum of five senior executives  may be granted a maximum of 12 000 Stock Options per person.Category 3 – other employees  approx. 220 persons  may be granted a maximum of 6 000 Stock Options per person.Allotment of Stock Options shall be based on inter alia the participant's performance  position and importance for INVISIO.No employee is guaranteed to be granted Stock Options.3. Stock Option price and purchase priceThe granted Stock Options are received free of charge.After the Stock Options have been granted and vested  and to the extent the performance criteria for the Stock Options have been reached  each Stock Option entitles to the acquisition of one (1) share in INVISIO at a price corresponding to the average share price of INVISIO's share during the period 1 April 2023 – 30 April 2023 (the ""Purchase Price""). The average share price shall be calculated as the average for each trading day calculated average volume-weighted price paid for the INVISIO share on Nasdaq Stockholm  round off to the nearest full ten öre whereby five öre shall be round off upwards.4. Vesting conditionsIf  for whatever reason  a participant's employment with the INVISIO group would come to an end before the end of the Vesting Period  the Stock Options will lapse and cannot be exercised. Only if the participant has been employed by the INVISIO group for at least 36 months at the end of the notice period  and:a. the employment is terminated by INVISIO or any of its subsidiaries for any reason other than due to the participant's breach of the employment agreement  orb. the employment is terminated in INVISIO or any of its subsidiaries by the participant due to a significant breach of the employment agreement by INVISIO or any of its subsidiaries the participant shall be entitled to exercise the Stock Options during the Exercise Period.A participant encompassed by items (a)-(b) above shall  with regard to the Stock Options  be treated as if he/she was still employed by the INVISIO group during the entire Vesting Period.5. Performance criteriaThe number of granted Stock Options  which each participant will be entitled to exercise to acquire shares in INVISIO  is dependent on the extent to which the following performance criteria for the Stock Option Program 2023/2026 has been reached:The share price development for the INVISIO share (including paid dividends from INVISIO to its shareholders for the period 1 April 2023 – 30 April 2026) during the Measurement Period compared to the SIX Portfolio Return Index (""SIXPRX"") reference index. (SIXPRX displays the average development (including dividends) on Nasdaq Stockholm adjusted for stock fund placement limitations.)In order for all (100 per cent) of the Stock Options to entitle the participant to acquire shares in INVISIO it is required that the share price development for INVISIO surpasses SIXPRX with 20 percentage points. If the share price development surpasses SIXPRX with 10 percentage points  half (50 per cent) of the participant's Stock Options will entitle the participant to acquire shares in INVISIO. If the share price development for the INVISIO share surpasses SIXPRX with more than 10 but with less than 20 percentage points  the Stock Options will entitle to acquisition of shares in INVISIO on a linear basis between 50 to 100 per cent. If the share price development in INVISIO does not surpasses SIXPRX with 10 percentage points  all (100 per cent) of the Stock Options will lapse.6. ExerciseThe exercise of Stock Options to acquire new shares in INVISIO may  to the extent the performance criteria for the Stock Option Program 2023/2026 is reached and the participant has fulfilled the vesting conditions  occur during the period 15 May – 30 June 2026 (the ""Exercise Period"").The Exercise Period may be postponed if the board deems it suitable.The Stock Options will automatically lapse and may no longer be exercised at the end of the Exercise Period.7. Transfer and pledgingStock Options are non-transferrable and may not be pledged.8. RecalculationAs far as the warrants  which have been issued to secure delivery of shares to the participants in the Stock Option Program 2023/2026  are subject to recalculation according to the terms and conditions for warrants  the Stock Options shall be recalculated accordingly.Recalculation shall take place in the event of e.g. bonus issues  rights issues  reverse share splits and share splits in accordance with the terms and conditions for warrants 2023/2026  which are available on INVISIO's website.9. Change of controlIn the event of a change of control in INVISIO  which inter alia includes that someone  directly or indirectly  owns or controls 50 per cent or more of the votes in INVISIO as well as in certain other events  participants have a right to exercise granted Stock Options in advance  i.e. even during the Vesting Period.10. Preparation and administrationThe Stock Options shall be subject to the provisions of separate agreements with each participant.The board shall be responsible for preparing the agreements with the participants and the administration of the Stock Option Program 2023/2026  with its primary terms and conditions being in accordance with the resolution by the Annual General Meeting. In connection therewith  the board may make adjustments in order to fulfil specific rules or market conditions. Further  the board may make other adjustments  including to resolve to reduce the number of Stock Options which may be exercised to acquire new shares (wholly or partially) for all employees or certain categories of employees which are encompassed by the Stock Option Program 2023/2026  if significant changes occur in the INVISIO group or on the market that the board considers entailing that the conditions for acquisition of new shares in the Stock Option Program 2023/2026 no longer fulfils the objective of the Stock Option Program 2023/2026.B. ISSUANCE OF WARRANTSIn order to secure the delivery of shares pursuant to the Stock Option Program 2023/2026  the board of INVISIO proposes that INVISIO  deviating from the shareholders' preferential rights  issues a maximum of 800 000 warrants  Series 2023/2026  entitling to subscription of new shares in INVISIO as follows.The warrants shall be issued free of charge. Each warrant shall entitle to subscription of one share in INVISIO  thus  the share capital will increase with maximum SEK 800 000 after full exercise of the warrants. With deviation of the shareholders' preferential rights  Invisio A/S shall be entitled to subscribe for the warrants. The warrants shall be subscribed for by 10 May 2023 at the latest. The term of subscription may be extended by the board. The warrants may be exercised for subscription of shares from the day the warrants are registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office up to and including 31 December 2026 . The warrants shall have a subscription price at subscription of new share corresponding to the average share price of the INVISIO share during the period 1 April 2023 – 30 April 2023 ( i . e . the same price as the Purchase Price  defined in item A). The average share price shall be calculated as the average for each trading day calculated average volume-weighted price paid for the INVISIO share on Nasdaq Stockholm   round off to the nearest full ten öre whereby five öre shall be round off upwards  during a specified period. In the event that a price paid is not available  the bid price listed as the closing price shall be included in the calculation. A day without a listing of a price paid or bid price shall not be included in the calculation. The newly issued shares shall entitle to dividend from the first record date for dividend that occurs after the shares have been registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office. The complete terms and conditions for the warrants are available on INVISIO's website and will be registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and Euroclear Sweden AB.The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights is that the issuance (and the transfer) ensures delivery of shares to the participants in the Stock Option Program 2023/2026. For an account of the reasons for adopting the Stock Option Program 2023/2026  please see item A.C. APPROVAL OF TRANSFER OF WARRANTSThe board proposes that the Subsidiary may transfer/dispose the warrants to the participants or otherwise to third parties for the purpose of delivering shares in INVISIO to the participants in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Stock Option Program 2023/2026.

Own shares may be repurchased and/or accepted as pledge based on the authorisation in order to  inter alia  develop the capital structure of the company  to finance or carry out acquisitions  investments or other business transactions  or in order to use the shares as part of the company's incentive and remuneration schemes. The authorisation is effective for a period of 18 months from the resolution of the AGM and it cancels the authorisation given by the Annual General Meeting on 7 April 2022 to decide on the repurchase and/or acceptance as pledge of own shares. Authorising the Board of Directors to decide on the issuance of shares The AGM authorised the Board of Directors to decide on the issuance of shares as follows: The number of shares to be issued based on the authorisation shall not exceed 8 000 000 shares  which corresponds to approximately 0.6 per cent of all the shares in the company. The Board of Directors decides on all the conditions of the issuance of shares  including to whom  at what price and in which manner the shares are issued. The authorisation concerns both the issuance of new shares as well as the transfer of treasury shares. The issuance may also be carried out in deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights (directed issue)  e.g.  for using the shares to develop the company's capital structure  to finance or carry out acquisitions  investments or other business transactions  or in order to use the shares as part of the company's incentive and remuneration schemes.The authorization is effective for a period of 18 months from the resolution of the AGM and it cancels the authorisation given by the Annual General Meeting on 7 April 2022 to decide on issuance of shares. Authorising the Board of Directors to decide on donations for public-benefit purposes The AGM authorized the Board of Directors to decide on donations up to an aggregate maximum of EUR 250 000 for public-benefit or corresponding purposes and that the Board of Directors be authorised to determine the recipients  purposes and other terms and conditions of the donations. The donations can be made in one or multiple installments. The authorisation is effective until the next Annual General Meeting. Amendment to the Charter of the Shareholders' Nomination Board In accordance with the proposal of the Shareholders' Nomination Board  the AGM resolved to amend the Charter of the Shareholders' Nomination Board so that the shareholders entitled to appoint a member are determined on the basis of the shareholders' register of the company maintained by Euroclear Finland Oy on the first working day in June (previously on the first working day in September) each year. Further  the AGM resolved to amend the Shareholders' Nomination Board so that the Chair of the company's Board of Directors shall act as the non-voting expert of the Shareholders' Nomination Board (previously as a member of the Shareholders' Nomination Board). In addition  the AGM resolved to make certain technical amendments to the Charter of the Shareholders' Nomination Board. Amendment of the Articles of Association In accordance with the proposal of the Board of Directors  the AGM decided that 11 § of the Articles of Association be amended to enable convening a General Meeting of shareholders as a virtual meeting without a meeting venue as an alternative to a physical meeting or a hybrid meeting. In its amended form  said provision of the Articles of Association reads as follows: ""11 § The Annual General Meeting of shareholders shall be held by the end of May each year. In order to be entitled to attend the meeting  a shareholder must register beforehand at the place and by the date specified in the notice of the meeting. The final date of registration may be at the earliest ten days before the meeting. The Board of Directors may decide that the General Meeting of shareholders is arranged without a meeting venue in a manner where shareholders exercise their full decision-making powers in real time during the General Meeting of shareholders using telecommunications and technical means (virtual meeting).""

Thereby the long-term interests of the employees aligns with the interests of the shareholders. In addition  the Stock Option Program 2023/2026 will be an important tool for INVISIO to recruit  retain and motivate the company's employees and the board considers the program beneficial for both INVISIO and its shareholders in the coming years. Board members elected by the general meeting are not allowed to participate in the Stock Option Program 2023/2026.A. ADOPTION OF THE PROGRAM1. The Stock Option Program 2023/2026 in briefAll INVISIO group employees shall be entitled to participate in the Stock Option Program 2023/2026.Based on performance  position and the employee's importance to the INVISIO group  the employees will be granted stock options which entitle the participants to acquire shares in INVISIO during 2026  subject to the terms and conditions of the Stock Option Program 2023/2026 (the ""Stock Options""). If the participant (i) throughout the entire vesting period of the Stock Option Program 2023/2026  which runs from the allotment of the Stock Option up to and including 8 May 2026 (the ""Vesting Period"")  with certain exceptions  is employed by the INVISIO group and (ii) to the extent the performance based criteria for the Stock Options has been reached during 9 May 2023 – 8 May 2026 (the ""Measurement Period"")  the participants will be entitled to acquire shares in INVISIO during May – June 2026.To ensure INVISIO's undertaking to deliver shares to the participants in the Stock Option Program 2023/2026  the board proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to issue a maximum of 800 000 warrants (each warrant entitles to subscription for one (1) share in INVISIO) to a wholly-owned Danish subsidiary  INVISIO A/S (the ""Subsidiary""). To such extent the performance criteria of the Stock Option Program 2023/2026 is reached  the warrants shall be exercised to deliver shares in INVISIO to the participants in the Stock Option Program 2023/2026.2. CostsPursuant to IFRS 2  the Stock Options are to be recorded as a personnel expense during the Vesting Period and should be reported directly against equity. Based on the assumption of a share price of SEK 220 at the time of allotment and calculated by using the Black & Scholes and Monte Carlo methods  the estimated total reported cost for the Stock Options is approx. SEK 25.1 million for the period 2023/2026.In the event of a positive price trend  social security costs will arise due to the Stock Options. These costs shall be written off during the tenor of the Stock Options based on the value changes of the Stock Options.Based on the assumption that all 800 000 Stock Options will be exercised to acquire new shares in INVISIO on 15 May 2026  and the INVISIO share price increases with 30 per cent and outperforms the SIXPRX Index (see definition below in item 5.5) by 20 percentage points during the Vesting Period  the social security costs are estimated to be approx. SEK 5.7 million. The costs are continuously reviewed during the Vesting Period.3. Dilution and effects on important key ratiosUp to 800 000 Stock Options may be issued to the participants in the program. The maximum number of shares in INVISIO which may be subscribed for in the Stock Option Program 2023/2026 is 800 000  corresponding to an increase of the share capital of a maximum of SEK 800 000. Based on the current number of outstanding shares  the maximum dilution resulting from the Stock Option Program 2023/2026 will be approx. 1.7 per cent of outstanding shares and votes  provided that all Stock Options are exercised to acquire new shares in INVISIO. The total dilution resulting from all Stock Options being exercised to acquire new shares in INVISIO in Stock Option Program 2020/2023  Stock Option Program 2022/2025 and Stock Option Program 2023/2026 is approx. 4.4 per cent based on the number of outstanding shares and votes as of today.The costs and dilution are expected to have only a marginal effect on the key ratios of INVISIO.4. Other share related incentive programsThere are two ongoing share related incentive programs in INVISIO  the Stock Option Program 2020/2023 adopted by the Annual General Meeting 2020 and the Stock Option Program 2022/2025 adopted by the Annual General Meeting 2022.5.

Persons who  at the time of allotment  have resigned from their employment  or who have been dismissed from their employment by INVISIO  will not be granted Stock Options. Future employees  who have not yet commenced their employment at the time of allotment  may  conditioned upon that the employment commences on 1 December 2023 at the latest  be offered to participate in the Stock Option Program 2023/2026 if the board considers it compatible with the objective of the program.The participants may be granted the maximum number of Stock Options as stated below.Category 1 – CEO may be granted a maximum of 24 000 Stock Options.Category 2 – a maximum of five senior executives  may be granted a maximum of 12 000 Stock Options per person.Category 3 – other employees  approx. 220 persons  may be granted a maximum of 6 000 Stock Options per person.Allotment of Stock Options shall be based on inter alia the participant's performance  position and importance for INVISIO.No employee is guaranteed to be granted Stock Options.3.

The average share price shall be calculated as the average for each trading day calculated average volume-weighted price paid for the INVISIO share on Nasdaq Stockholm  round off to the nearest full ten öre whereby five öre shall be round off upwards.4.

(SIXPRX displays the average development (including dividends) on Nasdaq Stockholm adjusted for stock fund placement limitations.)In order for all (100 per cent) of the Stock Options to entitle the participant to acquire shares in INVISIO it is required that the share price development for INVISIO surpasses SIXPRX with 20 percentage points. If the share price development surpasses SIXPRX with 10 percentage points  half (50 per cent) of the participant's Stock Options will entitle the participant to acquire shares in INVISIO. If the share price development for the INVISIO share surpasses SIXPRX with more than 10 but with less than 20 percentage points  the Stock Options will entitle to acquisition of shares in INVISIO on a linear basis between 50 to 100 per cent.

Further  the board may make other adjustments  including to resolve to reduce the number of Stock Options which may be exercised to acquire new shares (wholly or partially) for all employees or certain categories of employees which are encompassed by the Stock Option Program 2023/2026  if significant changes occur in the INVISIO group or on the market that the board considers entailing that the conditions for acquisition of new shares in the Stock Option Program 2023/2026 no longer fulfils the objective of the Stock Option Program 2023/2026.B. ISSUANCE OF WARRANTSIn order to secure the delivery of shares pursuant to the Stock Option Program 2023/2026  the board of INVISIO proposes that INVISIO  deviating from the shareholders' preferential rights  issues a maximum of 800 000 warrants  Series 2023/2026  entitling to subscription of new shares in INVISIO as follows.The warrants shall be issued free of charge.

These free shares will only vest if and when the eligible employees are still employed within the UCB Group three years after the grant of the awards;b) of which an estimated number of 215 000 shares to eligible employees under the Performance Share Plan  namely to approximately 150 individuals  according to the applicable allocation criteria. These free shares will be delivered after a three-year vesting period and the number of shares actually allocated will vary from 0% to 150% of the number of shares initially granted depending on the level of achievement of the performance conditions set by the Board of Directors of UCB SA/NV at the moment of grant.The estimated figures under a) and b) do not take into account employees hired or promoted to eligible levels between 1 January 2023 and 1 April 2023.10.

ST HELIER  Jersey  March 24  2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Caledonia Mining Corporation Plc (NYSE AMERICAN: CMCL; AIM: CMCL; VFEX: CMCL) (“Caledonia” or the “Company”) today announces that it proposes to raise approximately £8.1 million (approximately US$10 million) (before expenses)  pursuant to a placing (the “Placing”) of new common shares of no par value (the “Placing Shares”) at a price per Placing Share of £11.15 (approximately US$13.74) (the “Placing Price”). The Placing Price is equivalent to a discount of 13.2% to the closing price of the Company’s Common Shares on AIM  the market operated by London Stock Exchange plc (“LSE”) on 23 March 2023  being the latest practicable date prior to this announcement  and a discount of 3.0% to the volume weighted average price on AIM for the 30 trading days to 23 March 2023. The Placing is being conducted in the UK and South Africa through an accelerated bookbuilding process (the “Bookbuild”)  which is being managed by Cenkos Securities plc (“Cenkos”) and Liberum Capital Limited (“Liberum”) in the UK  and The Standard Bank of South Africa Limited (“Standard Bank”) in South Africa (together the “Joint Bookrunners”). In addition to the Placing  IH Securities (Private) Limited (“IH Securities”) is undertaking on behalf of the Company a placing in Zimbabwe of Zimbabwe depositary receipts (“ZDRs”) to raise approximately £2.4 million (approximately US$3 million) at  or at not less than  the Placing Price (the “Zimbabwe Placing” and  together with the Placing  the “Fundraise”). The Zimbabwe Placing will allow investors local to the Company’s operations the opportunity to participate. The Bookbuild will open with immediate effect following release of this announcement. The number of Placing Shares to be issued pursuant to the Placing will be agreed by the Joint Bookrunners and the Company following the close of the Bookbuild. The timing of the closing of the Bookbuild  the amount to be raised and allocations are at the sole discretion of Joint Bookrunners and the Company. Details of the number of Placing Shares to be issued will be announced as soon as practicable after the close of the Bookbuild. The Zimbabwe Placing will also open with immediate effect following release of this announcement and is expected to remain open until 12.00 p.m. on 31 March 2023. The Company will make a further announcement confirming the result of the Zimbabwe Placing as soon as practicable after it has closed. Members of the public are not entitled to participate in the Fundraise. Current trading and activity The Company today released its operating and financial results for the full year ending 31 December 2022 (“FY 2022”) and Management’s Discussions and Analysis (“MD&A”) for the quarter ended 31 December 2022 (“Q4”)  including the events occurring after the period end  a summary of which is as follows: The Company performed in line with market expectations in FY 2022  reporting gross revenues of US$142 million and EBITDA of US$50.4 million;In January 2023 the Company completed the acquisition of the Bilboes gold project in Zimbabwe;During Q4  the Company completed the acquisition of a business owning the mining lease for Motapa  a property contiguous to the Bilboes gold project with the potential for exploration and processing synergies; andGold production guidance for 2023 is between 87 500 – 97 000 ounces and comprises: 75 000 – 80 000 ounces from Blanket Mine 1 12 500 – 17 000 from the oxide operation at Bilboes 2Further information of the Company’s current trading and activity can be found in the Company’s announcement released at 7.00 a.m. UK time on 24 March 2023. Rationale for the Fundraise and Use of Proceeds The net proceeds of the Fundraise  together with the Company's existing cash reserves and the future cash to be generated from its ownership of the producing and cash generative Blanket Mine and from the Bilboes oxide operation  will strengthen the Company’s balance sheet and provide the Company with working capital flexibility to accelerate planned work at the three new gold projects it is currently undertaking in Zimbabwe. Bilboes Bilboes was acquired by the Company in January 2023 for a value of approximately US$65.7 million as at the date of completion  payable in Common Shares. As announced on 21 July 2022  Bilboes has NI 43-101 compliant proven and probable mineral reserves of 1.96 million ounces of gold in 26.64 million tonnes at a grade of 2.29 g/t  measured and indicated mineral resources of 2.56 million ounces of gold in 35.18 million tonnes at a grade of 2.26 g/t and inferred mineral resources of 577 000 ounces of gold in 9.48 million tonnes at a grade of 1.89 g/t3. Bilboes has produced approximately 288 000 ounces of gold since 1989. The first gold from Bilboes under Caledonia’s ownership is due to be produced at the end of March 2023. Approximately US$2 million of the net proceeds of the Fundraise are anticipated to be used to fund a new feasibility study to investigate commercialisation of Bilboes  possibly through a phased development approach. If successful  this would reduce the initial capital investment and also reduce the need for third party funding. A further US$2 million is expected to be used for the procurement of a management facility at Bulawayo which will be used to provide shared services for Blanket Mine and also for the projects at both Bilboes and Motapa. Motapa Caledonia acquired the Motapa gold exploration project in Southern Zimbabwe in November 2022 for US$8.25 million in cash and loan notes. As previously announced  Motapa is a large exploration property which is contiguous to the Bilboes gold project and approximately 75km north of Bulawayo. The Company believes the proximity to Bilboes will allow prospects of synergies in the evaluation of the geological potential for Motapa and  in due course  gold processing operations in the mining areas. The mining lease for Motapa covers approximately 2 200 hectares  and approximately US$6 million of the net proceeds of the Fundraise is expected to be used for further exploration of the area. Maligreen Acquired in November 2021 for US$4 million  the Maligreen mining claims are situated in the Gweru mining district in the Zimbabwe Midlands. The property contains NI 43-101 measured and indicated mineral resources of 442 000 ounces of gold in 8.03 million tonnes at 1.71 g/t and inferred mineral resources of 420 000 ounces of gold in 6.17 million tonnes at 2.12 g/t4. Approximately US$2 million of the net proceeds of the Fundraise are expected be used for drilling and exploration of the claims. Details of the Placing The Placing is subject to the terms and conditions set out in the Appendix (which forms part of this announcement  such announcement and the Appendix together the ""Announcement""). Application will be made to the NYSE American for approval to issue the Placing Shares and to the LSE for the Placing Shares to be admitted to trading on AIM.

ST HELIER  Jersey  March 24  2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Caledonia Mining Corporation Plc (NYSE AMERICAN: CMCL; AIM: CMCL; VFEX: CMCL) (“Caledonia” or the “Company”) today announces that it proposes to raise approximately £8.1 million (approximately US$10 million) (before expenses)  pursuant to a placing (the “Placing”) of new common shares of no par value (the “Placing Shares”) at a price per Placing Share of £11.15 (approximately US$13.74) (the “Placing Price”). The Placing Price is equivalent to a discount of 13.2% to the closing price of the Company’s Common Shares on AIM  the market operated by London Stock Exchange plc (“LSE”) on 23 March 2023  being the latest practicable date prior to this announcement  and a discount of 3.0% to the volume weighted average price on AIM for the 30 trading days to 23 March 2023. The Placing is being conducted in the UK and South Africa through an accelerated bookbuilding process (the “Bookbuild”)  which is being managed by Cenkos Securities plc (“Cenkos”) and Liberum Capital Limited (“Liberum”) in the UK  and The Standard Bank of South Africa Limited (“Standard Bank”) in South Africa (together the “Joint Bookrunners”). In addition to the Placing  IH Securities (Private) Limited (“IH Securities”) is undertaking on behalf of the Company a placing in Zimbabwe of Zimbabwe depositary receipts (“ZDRs”) to raise approximately £2.4 million (approximately US$3 million) at  or at not less than  the Placing Price (the “Zimbabwe Placing” and  together with the Placing  the “Fundraise”). The Zimbabwe Placing will allow investors local to the Company’s operations the opportunity to participate. The Bookbuild will open with immediate effect following release of this announcement. The number of Placing Shares to be issued pursuant to the Placing will be agreed by the Joint Bookrunners and the Company following the close of the Bookbuild. The timing of the closing of the Bookbuild  the amount to be raised and allocations are at the sole discretion of Joint Bookrunners and the Company. Details of the number of Placing Shares to be issued will be announced as soon as practicable after the close of the Bookbuild. The Zimbabwe Placing will also open with immediate effect following release of this announcement and is expected to remain open until 12.00 p.m. on 31 March 2023. The Company will make a further announcement confirming the result of the Zimbabwe Placing as soon as practicable after it has closed. Members of the public are not entitled to participate in the Fundraise. Current trading and activity The Company today released its operating and financial results for the full year ending 31 December 2022 (“FY 2022”) and Management’s Discussions and Analysis (“MD&A”) for the quarter ended 31 December 2022 (“Q4”)  including the events occurring after the period end  a summary of which is as follows: The Company performed in line with market expectations in FY 2022  reporting gross revenues of US$142 million and EBITDA of US$50.4 million;In January 2023 the Company completed the acquisition of the Bilboes gold project in Zimbabwe;During Q4  the Company completed the acquisition of a business owning the mining lease for Motapa  a property contiguous to the Bilboes gold project with the potential for exploration and processing synergies; andGold production guidance for 2023 is between 87 500 – 97 000 ounces and comprises: 75 000 – 80 000 ounces from Blanket Mine 1 12 500 – 17 000 from the oxide operation at Bilboes 2Further information of the Company’s current trading and activity can be found in the Company’s announcement released at 7.00 a.m. UK time on 24 March 2023. Rationale for the Fundraise and Use of Proceeds The net proceeds of the Fundraise  together with the Company's existing cash reserves and the future cash to be generated from its ownership of the producing and cash generative Blanket Mine and from the Bilboes oxide operation  will strengthen the Company’s balance sheet and provide the Company with working capital flexibility to accelerate planned work at the three new gold projects it is currently undertaking in Zimbabwe. Bilboes Bilboes was acquired by the Company in January 2023 for a value of approximately US$65.7 million as at the date of completion  payable in Common Shares. As announced on 21 July 2022  Bilboes has NI 43-101 compliant proven and probable mineral reserves of 1.96 million ounces of gold in 26.64 million tonnes at a grade of 2.29 g/t  measured and indicated mineral resources of 2.56 million ounces of gold in 35.18 million tonnes at a grade of 2.26 g/t and inferred mineral resources of 577 000 ounces of gold in 9.48 million tonnes at a grade of 1.89 g/t3. Bilboes has produced approximately 288 000 ounces of gold since 1989. The first gold from Bilboes under Caledonia’s ownership is due to be produced at the end of March 2023. Approximately US$2 million of the net proceeds of the Fundraise are anticipated to be used to fund a new feasibility study to investigate commercialisation of Bilboes  possibly through a phased development approach. If successful  this would reduce the initial capital investment and also reduce the need for third party funding. A further US$2 million is expected to be used for the procurement of a management facility at Bulawayo which will be used to provide shared services for Blanket Mine and also for the projects at both Bilboes and Motapa. Motapa Caledonia acquired the Motapa gold exploration project in Southern Zimbabwe in November 2022 for US$8.25 million in cash and loan notes. As previously announced  Motapa is a large exploration property which is contiguous to the Bilboes gold project and approximately 75km north of Bulawayo. The Company believes the proximity to Bilboes will allow prospects of synergies in the evaluation of the geological potential for Motapa and  in due course  gold processing operations in the mining areas. The mining lease for Motapa covers approximately 2 200 hectares  and approximately US$6 million of the net proceeds of the Fundraise is expected to be used for further exploration of the area. Maligreen Acquired in November 2021 for US$4 million  the Maligreen mining claims are situated in the Gweru mining district in the Zimbabwe Midlands. The property contains NI 43-101 measured and indicated mineral resources of 442 000 ounces of gold in 8.03 million tonnes at 1.71 g/t and inferred mineral resources of 420 000 ounces of gold in 6.17 million tonnes at 2.12 g/t4. Approximately US$2 million of the net proceeds of the Fundraise are expected be used for drilling and exploration of the claims.

In Asia  stock benchmarks were broadly lower amid cautious sentiment; Treasury yields dropped; the dollar gained; while oil and gold both fell.Equities:European stocks look set to dip on Friday  as worries about potential weakness in the banking system resurfaced after a raft of interest-rate decisions  including those from the Bank of England and Federal Reserve.Bank-stability risks are back in focus  a day after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said policy-makers would use their tools to protect depositors.Meanwhile  Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said she wasn't considering ways to guarantee all bank deposits at a Senate hearing.""The contradictions between Powell's comments and Yellen's were confusing to the markets  but Yellen's remarks [on Wednesday] were seen as backtracking on her commitment to helping keep small banks and their depositors safe in the event of panic setting in  which is the leading cause of contagion "" LPL Financial said.""The last thing markets need now is confusion and reneging from its top government officials  but that is exactly what happened.""---The Bank of England is likely to pause rate rises after Thursday's 25 basis points rate increase  as the U.K. economy is more sensitive to rate increases compared to the U.S. and the eurozone  said UniCredit Research.The U.K. has a greater proportion of short-term fixed-rate and variable-rate mortgages than the U.S. and eurozone and this makes its economy more sensitive to rate changes  it said.Goldman Sachs said the Fed and ECB will each hike 50 basis points further from here.The Fed  BOE  ECB  and SNB all increased their policy rates over the last week  signaling that recent interventions to stem deposit outflows and promote liquidity are sufficient to allow central banks to continue their rate hike campaigns for now  GS said.The policy rate path of major central banks will ultimately depend on how much stricter lending standards weigh on growth  it said.Forex:The dollar strengthened on possible safe-haven demand spurred by lingering financial stability concerns.Investors still appear to be seeking safety amid banking turmoil as the VIX Index has remained at a relatively high level  said CMC Markets.Goldman Sachs said the FOMC's meeting shows Fed officials think tighter credit conditions could be a substitute for rate increases to slow the economy  much as economists do.But these two policy channels have opposite implications for the dollar  GS said. ""Unlike a higher risk-free rate  tighter credit conditions lower the expected real rate of return on domestic assets and thereby deter portfolio flows and weaken the currency.""AMP Capital said it seems the major central banks that have tightened since the banking turmoil are determined to show they have measures to deal with financial stability issues and so monetary policy is free to deal with inflation.The ECB and Fed hiked but toned down hawkish guidance on rates as a result of the turmoil  while the BoE was likely forced over the line by a rebound in inflation reported earlier this week. The SNB is still playing catch up to the ECB with a policy rate of just 1.5%.Bonds:Treasury yields fell  as markets increasingly priced in a pause in monetary tightening  likely after only one more 25-basis point hike in May.Economic data and signs of further economic damage from the banking crisis are likely to keep moving Treasury markets.ING said the Bank of England may have reached its peak policy rate in the current cycle after a 25-basis-points rate increase on Thursday to 4.25%.Short-dated gilt-yield volatility should decline as a result  it said  adding that it expects the BOE to hold rates at their current level in the coming months.""Stability in policy rates means lower volatility in front-end yields  if the BOE can stick to its message of patience "" it said. ""This volatility will be displaced to the longer end  especially if a resilient economy pushes the inflation premium higher.""Fed funds futures traders priced in a 70% probability that the Fed will stand pat in May  and a 30% chance that policy makers will raise rates by another 25 basis points to between 5% and 5.25% by then  according to the CME FedWatch tool.The central bank is mostly expected by traders to cut its main interest-rate target range to between 4% and 4.25%  or lower  by the year-end despite Powell's statement on Wednesday that ""rate cuts are not in our base case.""""The Fed is no longer what markets are worried about and neither  really  is a recession "" Commonwealth Financial Network said. ""What markets are now worried about is a financial crisis.""Energy:Oil headed down in Asia  extending overnight losses.There could be concerns the U.S. government may not be able to refill its strategic reserve in the short term  after U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm told lawmakers that refilling the SPR would be difficult this year  ANZ said.""The market is also becoming increasingly impatient with the rebound in economic activity in China "" ANZ said  adding that consumer spending there remains subdued despite a sharp pickup in travel demand.Traders also weighed the prospects for an economic recession a day after the Fed delivered an interest rate hike and signaled at least one more increase this year.Metals:Gold prices weakened after settling overnight at a more than a year high on declines in U.S. Treasury yields and dollar weakness.The precious metal may remain in an upward trajectory over the medium term  ""especially if financial turmoil resurfaces and threatens to create systemic risks "" DailyFX said.""Throw in some risk-aversion on the back of Yellen's comments on the government not considering blanket insurance for bank deposits and gold is beginning to shine once more "" Oanda said.The Fed's 25 basis-point rate hike  coupled with the ongoing banking crisis  has further strengthened gold's position as a ""safe-haven asset  "" said Joseph Cavatoni  chief market strategist  North America  at World Gold Council.""This has resulted in a noticeable increase in the price of gold  indicating that both short-term speculators and long-term investors are showing a strong interest in this asset.""""Although there may be ongoing short-term volatility in the gold market as investors respond to the rate decision and economic outlook  we expect investors to consider strategic long-term allocations to gold over the course of the year "" said Cavatoni.---Copper prices were down amid market volatility due to the U.S. banking crisis.All eyes will be on whether the U.S. Fed will pause rate increases amid the banking turmoil  which could be good news for prices of the metal  ANZ said.If the U.S. dollar weakens  that could also support copper prices  ANZ added.---Chinese iron-ore futures fell amid worries over demand.The top iron-ore exporters are likely to increase their shipments in the coming months as supply-side disruptions abate  but this comes amid signs of weakening demand  ANZ Research said.Chinese steel mills have been cutting their selling prices  while spot prices for rebar used in construction have dropped sharply  it added.TODAY'S TOP HEADLINESYellen says U.S. would take 'additional actions' to stabilize bank system if necessaryTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Thursday told lawmakers that the federal government would take extra steps to stabilize the U.S. banking system if necessary.""We have used important tools to act quickly to prevent contagion "" Yellen said in testimony prepared for delivery to a House Appropriations subcommittee. ""And they are tools we could use again.""SVB Sale Is Close. FDIC Seeking a Deal by Monday.The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. is planning to announce its decision on the sale of Silicon Valley Bank this weekend  Barron's Advisor has learned.A person familiar with the FDIC's plans indicates that the banking regulator hopes to present a resolution of the auction over the weekend.U.K. Consumer Confidence Rose to 12-Month High in MarchConfidence among U.K. consumers rose in March to its highest level in a year but remained subdued as persistently high inflation continued to weigh on household finances.Research firm GfK said its consumer-confidence barometer increased to minus 36 in March from minus 38 a month earlier  in line with economist estimates in a poll by The Wall Street Journal.TikTok Fight Rocks U.S.-China RelationsU.S.-China relations were dealt another blow as lawmakers at a House hearing pummeled TikTok's chief executive over the popular app's ties to China  and as Beijing said it would fight any U.S. attempt to force the company's sale by its Chinese owners.The hearing Thursday  peppered with withering attacks on TikTok from both Democrats and Republicans  ran more than five hours and underscored growing concern about Beijing's potential influence over the app. U.S.-China relations are already frayed over trade  Taiwan  technology and geopolitical rivalries.Iran Could Produce Nuclear Weapon in Several Months if It Decides to Do So  Mark Milley SaysIran would need only several months to build a nuclear weapon if Tehran opted to produce a bomb  Gen.

Read full story,FRANKFURT  March 24 (Xinhua) -- The share prices of Germany's biggest lender Deutsche Bank (DB) plunged on Friday as concerns about the health of European banks are mounting in the wake of the collapse of banks in the United States.DB topped the list of companies that suffered the sharpest decline of their shares on the German stock exchange (Deutsche Boerse)  down 8.53 percent at closing on Friday. The share price of Commerzbank AG  the second largest bank in Germany  dropped 5.45 percent.DB has lost some 30 percent of its market value since the onset of worries about the banking sector sparked by the shutdown of the U.S. Silicon Valley Bank about two weeks ago.There is still no sign that investors' nervousness about European banks is abating. The slump of share prices of DB and Commerzbank is believed to be triggered by the skyrocketing prices of their Credit Default Swap (CDS)  a form of insurance put on bonds against credit default events.Local German press quoted S&P Market Intelligence as saying that more than 200 000 euros (215 120 U.S. dollars) had to be paid over the course of a 10 million euro package of Deutsche Bank bonds instead of 142 000 euros as on Wednesday. The sudden and precipitous rise of CDS price is a sign that investors' concern about the default risks of DB bonds is mounting.German Chancellor Olaf Scholz dismissed the concern about the health of DB on Friday. He said at a summit of European Union (EU) leaders in Brussels that there is no reason to worry as DB has fundamentally modernized and reorganized its business model and is a very profitable bank.The European Central Bank claimed at the beginning of this month that it is keeping a close eye on the situation of the banking industry and its toolkit is fully equipped to provide liquidity support to the eurozone financial system.,neutral,0.01,0.98,0.02,mixed,0.14,0.12,0.74,True,English,"['Deutsche Bank stocks', 'U.S. Silicon Valley Bank', 'German Chancellor Olaf Scholz', 'S&P Market Intelligence', 'European Union (EU) leaders', 'biggest lender Deutsche Bank', 'The European Central Bank', '15,120 U.S. dollars', 'second largest bank', 'German stock exchange', 'Local German press', '10 million euro package', 'eurozone financial system', 'Credit Default Swap', 'credit default events', 'Deutsche Bank bonds', 'profitable bank', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'market value', 'European banks', 'default risks', 'share prices', 'United States', 'sharpest decline', 'banking sector', ""investors' nervousness"", 'skyrocketing prices', 'precipitous rise', 'business model', 'close eye', 'banking industry', 'liquidity support', 'Commerzbank AG', 'CDS price', ""investors' concern"", 'DB bonds', 'FRANKFURT', 'March', 'Xinhua', 'Germany', 'Friday', 'concerns', 'health', 'wake', 'collapse', 'list', 'companies', 'shares', '30 percent', 'onset', 'worries', 'shutdown', 'sign', 'slump', 'form', 'insurance', '200,000 euros', 'course', '142,000 euros', 'Wednesday', 'sudden', 'summit', 'Brussels', 'reason', 'beginning', 'month', 'situation', 'toolkit']",2023-03-25,2023-03-25,thestar.com.my

I would also like to thank the Pharming and the Novartis teams who have supported the development of Joenja® and can  therefore  be justifiably proud of this FDA approval. Today also marks a landmark event for Pharming and demonstrates our commitment to transforming the lives of patients who suffer from rare diseases. The approval and near-term launch of Joenja®  our second commercial product  brings us closer to our goal of becoming a leading global rare disease company dedicated to patient communities with unmet medical needs.""APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that was first characterized in 2013 and is currently estimated to affect 1 to 2 people per million. It is caused by genetic variants in either one of two identified genes  known as PIK3CD or PIK3R1  which are vital to the normal development and function of immune cells in the body. While people with APDS may suffer from a wide variety of symptoms  the most common are frequent and severe infections of the ears  sinuses  and upper and lower respiratory tracts. Infections usually begin in infancy. People with APDS are susceptible to swollen lymph nodes or an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly)  as well as autoimmunity and inflammatory symptoms. People with APDS may also be at higher risk for cancers like lymphoma.The FDA evaluated the New Drug Application (NDA) for Joenja® under priority review and has approved the drug based on findings from a multinational  triple-blind  placebo-controlled  randomized Phase II/III clinical trial  which evaluated efficacy and safety in 31 patients diagnosed with APDS aged 12 years and older. Also submitted as part of the application were data from a long-term  open-label extension clinical trial in which 38 patients received Joenja® for a median of two years.Results from the 12-week randomized  placebo-controlled study in 31 patients with APDS aged 12 years and older demonstrated clinical efficacy of Joenja® 70mg twice daily over placebo  and was significant in the co-primary endpoints which evaluated improvement in lymphoproliferation as measured by the reduction in lymph node size and increase in naïve B cells  reflecting the impact on immune dysregulation and normalization of immunophenotype in these patients  respectively. The adjusted mean change (95% CI) between Joenja® and placebo for lymph node size was -0.25 (–0.38 -0.12; P=0.0006; N=26) and for percentage of naïve B cells was 37.30 (24.06  50.54; P=0.0002; N=13). The most common adverse reactions in the clinical trial (incidence >10%) were headache  sinusitis  and atopic dermatitis.With the approval of Joenja®  as a treatment for a rare pediatric disease  the FDA granted Pharming a priority review voucher (""PRV""). Pursuant to the terms of Pharming's 2019 exclusive license agreement with Novartis for leniolisib  Novartis has the right to purchase the PRV from Pharming for a small minority share of the value of the PRV. Pursuant to the agreement  Pharming will make milestone payments to Novartis and another party for the approval and first commercial sale for APDS totaling $10.5 million and we agreed to make certain additional milestone payments to Novartis in an aggregate amount of up to $190 million upon the achievement of certain leniolisib sales milestones. We also agreed to make tiered royalty payments to Novartis  calculated as low double-digit to high-teen double-digit percentage of net sales of leniolisib.For more information regarding APDS  please visit AllAboutAPDS.com.

Pharming expects that CHMP will issue its opinion on the MAA in the second half of 2023.US Important Safety Information for Joenja® (leniolisib)INDICATIONS AND USAGEJoenja® (leniolisib) is a kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kδ) syndrome (APDS) in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONVerify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating treatment with Joenja®.Joenja® may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential risk to a fetus and to use highly effective methods of contraception during treatment with Joenja® and for 1 week after the last dose of Joenja®.Live  attenuated vaccinations may be less effective if administered during Joenja® treatment.Use of Joenja® in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment is not recommended. There is no recommended dosage for patients weighing less than 45 kg.The most common adverse reactions (incidence >10%) seen in clinical trials were headache  sinusitis  and atopic dermatitis.Seven (33%) patients receiving Joenja® developed an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) between 500 and 1500 cells/microL. No patients developed an ANC <500 cells/microL and there were no reports of infection associated with neutropenia.About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase δ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that was first characterized in 2013. APDS is caused by variants in either one of two identified genes known as PIK3CD or PIK3R1  which are vital to the development and function of immune cells in the body. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3Kδ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway  which causes immune cells to fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.1 2 3 APDS is characterized by a variety of symptoms  including severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.4 5 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  it has been reported that people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.6 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.4-7 A definitive diagnosis can be made through genetic testing. APDS affects approximately 1 to 2 people per million worldwide.About Joenja® (leniolisib)Joenja® (leniolisib) is an oral small molecule phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kẟ) inhibitor approved in the US as the first and only targeted treatment of activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kδ) syndrome (APDS) in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older. Joenja® inhibits the production of phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate  which serves as an important cellular messenger and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Results from a randomized  placebo-controlled Phase II/III clinical trial demonstrated clinical efficacy of Joenja® in the co-primary endpoints; demonstrating statistically significant impact on immune dysregulation and normalization of immunophenotype within these patients  and interim open label extension data has supported the safety and tolerability of long-term Joenja® administration.8 Leniolisib is currently under regulatory review by the European Medicines Agency  with plans to pursue further regulatory approvals in the UK  Canada  Australia and Japan. Leniolisib is also being evaluated in a Phase III clinical trial in children aged 4 to 11 with APDS  with a further trial planned in children aged 1 to 6 years with APDS.

Advise patients of the potential risk to a fetus and to use highly effective methods of contraception during treatment with Joenja® and for 1 week after the last dose of Joenja®.Live  attenuated vaccinations may be less effective if administered during Joenja® treatment.Use of Joenja® in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment is not recommended. There is no recommended dosage for patients weighing less than 45 kg.The most common adverse reactions (incidence >10%) seen in clinical trials were headache  sinusitis  and atopic dermatitis.Seven (33%) patients receiving Joenja® developed an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) between 500 and 1500 cells/microL. No patients developed an ANC <500 cells/microL and there were no reports of infection associated with neutropenia.About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase δ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that was first characterized in 2013. APDS is caused by variants in either one of two identified genes known as PIK3CD or PIK3R1  which are vital to the development and function of immune cells in the body. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3Kδ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway  which causes immune cells to fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.1 2 3 APDS is characterized by a variety of symptoms  including severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.4 5 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  it has been reported that people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.6 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.4-7 A definitive diagnosis can be made through genetic testing. APDS affects approximately 1 to 2 people per million worldwide.About Joenja® (leniolisib)Joenja® (leniolisib) is an oral small molecule phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kẟ) inhibitor approved in the US as the first and only targeted treatment of activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kδ) syndrome (APDS) in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older. Joenja® inhibits the production of phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate  which serves as an important cellular messenger and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Results from a randomized  placebo-controlled Phase II/III clinical trial demonstrated clinical efficacy of Joenja® in the co-primary endpoints; demonstrating statistically significant impact on immune dysregulation and normalization of immunophenotype within these patients  and interim open label extension data has supported the safety and tolerability of long-term Joenja® administration.8 Leniolisib is currently under regulatory review by the European Medicines Agency  with plans to pursue further regulatory approvals in the UK  Canada  Australia and Japan. Leniolisib is also being evaluated in a Phase III clinical trial in children aged 4 to 11 with APDS  with a further trial planned in children aged 1 to 6 years with APDS.

In this regard  algoWatt's Board of Directors has noted that:On December 13  2022  as announced in a press release (available on the website algowatt.com / ""Press Releases"" section) regarding the implementation status of the Restructuring Plan and Financial Agreement pursuant to Article 67  paragraph 3  letter d) of the Italian L.F. (now Article 56 of the C.C.I.I.)  algoWatt and its parent company Italeaf submitted a proposal for a ""Stand Still"" until June 30  2023 to the signatories of the aforementioned plan;Following the above proposal  discussions with the counterparties of the Financial Agreement are currently underway to negotiate a modification of it  and therefore  it has become appropriate to postpone the approval of the 2022 budget plan  also to take into account the update of the Restructuring Plan.UPDATE OF THE CORPORATE EVENTS CALENDARTaking into account the progress of the process described - of which the market will be regularly informed - and the relevance of the outcome of the negotiations aimed at achieving an update of the Plan  the Board of Directors deemed it appropriate to postpone any decision regarding the approval of the separate and the consolidated financial statements as of December 31  2022  until June 30  2023  in order to fully take into account the impacts arising from the definition of the updated financial agreement in the approval of such financial data. The precise date of the board meeting for the approval of the 2022 financial statements and for the convening of the Shareholders' Meeting will be communicated to the market in a subsequent press release  in the manner established by the applicable regulations.APPOINTMENT OF ADVISORS FOR UPDATING THE RESTRUCTURING PLAN AND FINANCIAL AGREEMENTWith regard to the process of updating the Restructuring Plan and the Financial Agreement  also in light of the regulatory changes introduced by the Italian Corporate Insolvency and Recovery Code and by Decree Law 13/2023  algoWatt has appointed R&S Advisory S.r.l.  representend by dr Paolo Lisca  as financial advisor and the law firm Fallanca-Scicolone & Partners  represented by lawyer Marco Scicolone  for legal assistance in order to negotiate the aforementioned update of the Financial Agreement.NEW STRATEGIC GUIDELINESalgoWatt also informs that the amendment to the Restructuring Plan envisages  inter alia  the launch of a new business plan  through the modification of the business model and a revision of the Company's strategic and financial objectives. As part of this activity  the counterparties to the Financial Agreement had been notified of the intention to approve the strategic guidelines  relating to the industrial activities of the new Industrial Plan 2023-2025  by March 2023. In particular  the new strategic guidelines - drawn up with the consultancy of STAM Srl  a company specialising in high technology applied to energy  the environment  industry and automation - identify three high-level objectives  consistent with the Plan defined by algoWatt to emerge from the current state of financial tension  based on four drivers of industrial growth.Three high-level objectivesLeadership in the twin transition market (digital solutions for sustainability)The energy sector is responsible for about three quarters of today's greenhouse gas emissions and is the key to averting the worst effects of climate change. The Twin Transition assets and competencies (software solutions and associated services) are part of the company's history. The portfolio of algoWatt's solutions and services is characterised by a focus on energy and elements related to its management. Among the fundamental assets functional to the ""Twin Transition"" objective is algoWatt's European and regional R&D project portfolio  which is strongly aimed at enhancing and innovating technology on the core themes of the Twin Transition itself.From provider to partnerStarting from the assumption that in today's market  a service provider is now regarded as a commodity (with the high risk of turnover)  the transformation into a technology partner becomes essential to affirm the role of a company that becomes an integral part of the customer's business. The markets of digital solutions for energy  environment and plants represent a fundamental part of algoWatt's history  which has a characterising know-how and can represent a great added value for prospects and customers. algoWatt can also count on the added value  skills and track record of TerniEnergia Progetti  an asset to be leveraged to present itself as a partner with experience in the sector and the ability to make a supply chain in an excellent market moment for the photovoltaic sector.Growth in the Digital Circular EconomyEnvironmental sustainability  and in particular the circular economy  are at the centre of the main European and national strategic agendas (Green New Deal  Circular Economy Package  National Strategy for the Circular Economy  PNRR  co-funded research and innovation programmes  etc.) with the consequent mobilisation of significant public-private investments to boost this sector as it is considered key to: i) achieving the 2030 and 2050 decarbonisation targets; ii) decoupling production from raw material consumption; iii) activating new business models. To date  the main focus has been on the development and industrialisation of technologies and less on digitalisation aspects related to both logistics and process automation. This opens up space for market expansion and diversification within the 'digital circular economy'.Four strategic driversAchieving financial sustainabilityResolution of the financial tension as the main driver  through a negotiated revision of the Recovery Plan and the related Financial Agreement. EPC e O&M with TerniEnergia ProgettiThe operational re-launch of TerniEnergia Progetti will represent a key element of the strategy  allowing an increase in consolidated revenues and at the same time the possibility to achieve relevant stewardship and partnership agreements  functional to the change of the business model from provider to partner. Research Development and InnovationalgoWatt's excellence in RD&I will be put at the service of the development of innovative solutions in the Twin Transition and Digital Circular Economy. Portfolio rationalisationGreater focus on the Twin Transition and Digital Circular Economy  with the consequent exploitation of opportunities for divestment or disposal of software platforms and contracts not in scope  as well as M&A opportunities through the use of treasury shares  amounting to approximately 2.15% of the share capital  to integrate into the Group realities possessing competences and skills capable of strengthening algoWatt's technological offering.Please login to download",neutral,0.02,0.98,0.0,mixed,0.33,0.18,0.49,True,English,"['new strategic guidelines', 'AlgoWatt S', '2022 financial statements', 'Restructuring Plan', 'Financial Agreement', 'Postponement', 'approval', 'update', 'R&S Advisory S.r.l.', 'regional R&D project portfolio', 'C.C.I.I.', 'The Twin Transition assets', 'Italian L.F.', 'corporate event calendar', 'CORPORATE EVENTS CALENDAR', 'Italian Corporate Insolvency', 'dr Paolo Lisca', 'lawyer Marco Scicolone', 'greenhouse gas emissions', 'Twin Transition"" objective', 'Digital Circular Economy', 'three high-level objectives', 'Euronext Milan market', 'twin transition market', 'great added value', 'excellent market moment', 'NEW STRATEGIC GUIDELINES', 'consolidated financial statements', 'subsequent press release', 'updated financial agreement', 'new Industrial Plan', 'new business plan', 'fundamental assets', '2022 financial statements', 'financial objectives', 'three quarters', 'Press Releases', 'industrial activities', 'financial data', 'financial advisor', 'financial tension', 'digital solutions', 'Borsa Italiana', 'publication date', 'implementation status', 'precise date', ""Shareholders' Meeting"", 'applicable regulations', 'regulatory changes', 'Recovery Code', 'Decree Law', 'law firm', 'legal assistance', 'business model', 'STAM Srl', 'current state', 'four drivers', 'worst effects', 'climate change', 'core themes', 'high risk', 'characterising know-how', 'track record', 'TerniEnergia Progetti', 'supply chain', 'Restructuring Plan', '2022 budget plan', 'industrial growth', 'software solutions', 'high technology', 'photovoltaic sector', 'associated services', 'service provider', 'integral part', 'fundamental part', 'Environmental sustainability', 'GreenTech Company', 'parent company', 'board meeting', 'technology partner', 'energy sector', 'algoWatt', 'postponement', 'approval', 'January', 'regard', 'Directors', 'December', 'website', 'section', 'Article', 'paragraph', 'letter', 'Italeaf', 'proposal', 'June', 'signatories', 'discussions', 'counterparties', 'modification', 'account', 'progress', 'process', 'relevance', 'outcome', 'negotiations', 'decision', 'separate', 'order', 'impacts', 'definition', 'convening', 'manner', 'APPOINTMENT', 'ADVISORS', 'light', 'Fallanca-Scicolone', 'Partners', 'amendment', 'launch', 'revision', 'activity', 'intention', 'March', 'consultancy', 'industry', 'automation', 'Leadership', 'today', 'key', 'competencies', 'history', 'focus', 'elements', 'management', 'European', 'assumption', 'commodity', 'turnover', 'transformation', 'role', 'customer', 'markets', 'plants', 'prospects', 'skills', 'experience']",2023-03-24,2023-03-25,marketscreener.com

(""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM/Nasdaq: PHAR) announces that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Joenja® (leniolisib) for the treatment of activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kδ) syndrome (APDS) in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older. Joenja®  an oral  selective PI3Kδ inhibitor  is the first and only treatment approved in the US for APDS  a rare and progressive primary immunodeficiency. The FDA evaluated the Joenja® application for APDS under Priority Review  which is granted to therapies that have the potential to provide significant improvements in the treatment  diagnosis or prevention of serious conditions. Joenja® is expected to launch in the US in early April and will be available for shipment in mid-April.Dr. Eveline Wu  MD  MSCR  Division Chief  Paediatric Rheumatology & Associate Professor of Paediatric Rheumatology and Allergy/Immunology at The University of North Carolina School of Medicine  said:""The FDA approval of Joenja® is an exciting moment for the APDS community and offers to transform the treatment pathway for patients and families affected by this rare disease. This approval means that they will  for the first time  have access to an approved treatment  which has the potential to change the standard of care for the patient population suffering from APDS.""Vicki Modell  co-founder of the Jeffrey Modell Foundation  an international  non-profit  organization dedicated to helping individuals and family members affected by primary immunodeficiency disorders  commented:""The approval of Pharming's Joenja® is an important step toward making a difference in the lives of individuals living with APDS who experience severe  life-altering and progressive symptoms. The FDA approval of a treatment option for one of the more than 450 primary immunodeficiencies is also a key moment for the broader primary immunodeficiency community. The Jeffrey Modell Foundation's mission of hope  advocacy and action is dedicated to early diagnosis  genetic sequencing  treatments and ultimately  future cures for primary immunodeficiencies.""Sijmen de Vries  Chief Executive Officer of Pharming  commented:""This FDA approval of Joenja® is an important milestone for people living with APDS who will now have access to the first approved treatment option specifically for this debilitating disease. Until now  management of APDS has relied on the treatment of the diverse symptoms associated with APDS. We are grateful to the patients  caregivers  and physicians who participated in the clinical trials who have made today's approval a reality. I would also like to thank the Pharming and the Novartis teams who have supported the development of Joenja® and can  therefore  be justifiably proud of this FDA approval. Today also marks a landmark event for Pharming and demonstrates our commitment to transforming the lives of patients who suffer from rare diseases. The approval and near-term launch of Joenja®  our second commercial product  brings us closer to our goal of becoming a leading global rare disease company dedicated to patient communities with unmet medical needs.""APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that was first characterized in 2013 and is currently estimated to affect 1 to 2 people per million. It is caused by genetic variants in either one of two identified genes  known as PIK3CD or PIK3R1  which are vital to the normal development and function of immune cells in the body. While people with APDS may suffer from a wide variety of symptoms  the most common are frequent and severe infections of the ears  sinuses  and upper and lower respiratory tracts. Infections usually begin in infancy. People with APDS are susceptible to swollen lymph nodes or an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly)  as well as autoimmunity and inflammatory symptoms. People with APDS may also be at higher risk for cancers like lymphoma.The FDA evaluated the New Drug Application (NDA) for Joenja® under priority review and has approved the drug based on findings from a multinational  triple-blind  placebo-controlled  randomized Phase II/III clinical trial  which evaluated efficacy and safety in 31 patients diagnosed with APDS aged 12 years and older. Also submitted as part of the application were data from a long-term  open-label extension clinical trial in which 38 patients received Joenja® for a median of two years.Results from the 12-week randomized  placebo-controlled study in 31 patients with APDS aged 12 years and older demonstrated clinical efficacy of Joenja® 70mg twice daily over placebo  and was significant in the co-primary endpoints which evaluated improvement in lymphoproliferation as measured by the reduction in lymph node size and increase in naïve B cells  reflecting the impact on immune dysregulation and normalization of immunophenotype in these patients  respectively. The adjusted mean change (95% CI) between Joenja® and placebo for lymph node size was -0.25 (–0.38 -0.12; P=0.0006; N=26) and for percentage of naïve B cells was 37.30 (24.06  50.54; P=0.0002; N=13). The most common adverse reactions in the clinical trial (incidence >10%) were headache  sinusitis  and atopic dermatitis.With the approval of Joenja®  as a treatment for a rare pediatric disease  the FDA granted Pharming a priority review voucher (""PRV""). Pursuant to the terms of Pharming's 2019 exclusive license agreement with Novartis for leniolisib  Novartis has the right to purchase the PRV from Pharming for a small minority share of the value of the PRV. Pursuant to the agreement  Pharming will make milestone payments to Novartis and another party for the approval and first commercial sale for APDS totaling $10.5 million and we agreed to make certain additional milestone payments to Novartis in an aggregate amount of up to $190 million upon the achievement of certain leniolisib sales milestones.

Pharming expects that CHMP will issue its opinion on the MAA in the second half of 2023.US Important Safety Information for Joenja® (leniolisib)INDICATIONS AND USAGEJoenja® (leniolisib) is a kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kδ) syndrome (APDS) in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONVerify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating treatment with Joenja®.Joenja® may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential risk to a fetus and to use highly effective methods of contraception during treatment with Joenja® and for 1 week after the last dose of Joenja®.Live  attenuated vaccinations may be less effective if administered during Joenja® treatment.Use of Joenja® in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment is not recommended. There is no recommended dosage for patients weighing less than 45 kg.The most common adverse reactions (incidence >10%) seen in clinical trials were headache  sinusitis  and atopic dermatitis.Seven (33%) patients receiving Joenja® developed an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) between 500 and 1500 cells/microL. No patients developed an ANC <500 cells/microL and there were no reports of infection associated with neutropenia.About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase δ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that was first characterized in 2013. APDS is caused by variants in either one of two identified genes known as PIK3CD or PIK3R1  which are vital to the development and function of immune cells in the body. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3Kδ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway  which causes immune cells to fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.1 2 3 APDS is characterized by a variety of symptoms  including severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.4 5 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  it has been reported that people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.6 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.4-7 A definitive diagnosis can be made through genetic testing. APDS affects approximately 1 to 2 people per million worldwide.About Joenja® (leniolisib)Joenja® (leniolisib) is an oral small molecule phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kẟ) inhibitor approved in the US as the first and only targeted treatment of activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kδ) syndrome (APDS) in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older. Joenja® inhibits the production of phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate  which serves as an important cellular messenger and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Results from a randomized  placebo-controlled Phase II/III clinical trial demonstrated clinical efficacy of Joenja® in the co-primary endpoints; demonstrating statistically significant impact on immune dysregulation and normalization of immunophenotype within these patients  and interim open label extension data has supported the safety and tolerability of long-term Joenja® administration.8 Leniolisib is currently under regulatory review by the European Medicines Agency  with plans to pursue further regulatory approvals in the UK  Canada  Australia and Japan. Leniolisib is also being evaluated in a Phase III clinical trial in children aged 4 to 11 with APDS  with a further trial planned in children aged 1 to 6 years with APDS.

(""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM/Nasdaq: PHAR) announces that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Joenja® (leniolisib) for the treatment of activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kδ) syndrome (APDS) in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older. Joenja®  an oral  selective PI3Kδ inhibitor  is the first and only treatment approved in the US for APDS  a rare and progressive primary immunodeficiency. The FDA evaluated the Joenja® application for APDS under Priority Review  which is granted to therapies that have the potential to provide significant improvements in the treatment  diagnosis or prevention of serious conditions. Joenja® is expected to launch in the US in early April and will be available for shipment in mid-April.Dr. Eveline Wu  MD  MSCR  Division Chief  Paediatric Rheumatology & Associate Professor of Paediatric Rheumatology and Allergy/Immunology at The University of North Carolina School of Medicine  said:""The FDA approval of Joenja® is an exciting moment for the APDS community and offers to transform the treatment pathway for patients and families affected by this rare disease. This approval means that they will  for the first time  have access to an approved treatment  which has the potential to change the standard of care for the patient population suffering from APDS.""Vicki Modell  co-founder of the Jeffrey Modell Foundation  an international  non-profit  organization dedicated to helping individuals and family members affected by primary immunodeficiency disorders  commented:""The approval of Pharming's Joenja® is an important step toward making a difference in the lives of individuals living with APDS who experience severe  life-altering and progressive symptoms. The FDA approval of a treatment option for one of the more than 450 primary immunodeficiencies is also a key moment for the broader primary immunodeficiency community. The Jeffrey Modell Foundation's mission of hope  advocacy and action is dedicated to early diagnosis  genetic sequencing  treatments and ultimately  future cures for primary immunodeficiencies.""Sijmen de Vries  Chief Executive Officer of Pharming  commented:""This FDA approval of Joenja® is an important milestone for people living with APDS who will now have access to the first approved treatment option specifically for this debilitating disease. Until now  management of APDS has relied on the treatment of the diverse symptoms associated with APDS. We are grateful to the patients  caregivers  and physicians who participated in the clinical trials who have made today's approval a reality. I would also like to thank the Pharming and the Novartis teams who have supported the development of Joenja® and can  therefore  be justifiably proud of this FDA approval. Today also marks a landmark event for Pharming and demonstrates our commitment to transforming the lives of patients who suffer from rare diseases. The approval and near-term launch of Joenja®  our second commercial product  brings us closer to our goal of becoming a leading global rare disease company dedicated to patient communities with unmet medical needs.""APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that was first characterized in 2013 and is currently estimated to affect 1 to 2 people per million. It is caused by genetic variants in either one of two identified genes  known as PIK3CD or PIK3R1  which are vital to the normal development and function of immune cells in the body. While people with APDS may suffer from a wide variety of symptoms  the most common are frequent and severe infections of the ears  sinuses  and upper and lower respiratory tracts. Infections usually begin in infancy. People with APDS are susceptible to swollen lymph nodes or an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly)  as well as autoimmunity and inflammatory symptoms. People with APDS may also be at higher risk for cancers like lymphoma.The FDA evaluated the New Drug Application (NDA) for Joenja® under priority review and has approved the drug based on findings from a multinational  triple-blind  placebo-controlled  randomized Phase II/III clinical trial  which evaluated efficacy and safety in 31 patients diagnosed with APDS aged 12 years and older. Also submitted as part of the application were data from a long-term  open-label extension clinical trial in which 38 patients received Joenja® for a median of two years.Results from the 12-week randomized  placebo-controlled study in 31 patients with APDS aged 12 years and older demonstrated clinical efficacy of Joenja® 70mg twice daily over placebo  and was significant in the co-primary endpoints which evaluated improvement in lymphoproliferation as measured by the reduction in lymph node size and increase in naïve B cells  reflecting the impact on immune dysregulation and normalization of immunophenotype in these patients  respectively. The adjusted mean change (95% CI) between Joenja® and placebo for lymph node size was -0.25 (–0.38 -0.12; P=0.0006; N=26) and for percentage of naïve B cells was 37.30 (24.06  50.54; P=0.0002; N=13). The most common adverse reactions in the clinical trial (incidence >10%) were headache  sinusitis  and atopic dermatitis.With the approval of Joenja®  as a treatment for a rare pediatric disease  the FDA granted Pharming a priority review voucher (""PRV""). Pursuant to the terms of Pharming's 2019 exclusive license agreement with Novartis for leniolisib  Novartis has the right to purchase the PRV from Pharming for a small minority share of the value of the PRV. Pursuant to the agreement  Pharming will make milestone payments to Novartis and another party for the approval and first commercial sale for APDS totaling $10.5 million and we agreed to make certain additional milestone payments to Novartis in an aggregate amount of up to $190 million upon the achievement of certain leniolisib sales milestones. We also agreed to make tiered royalty payments to Novartis  calculated as low double-digit to high-teen double-digit percentage of net sales of leniolisib.For more information regarding APDS  please visit AllAboutAPDS.com.

Joenja®  an oral  selective PI3Kδ inhibitor  is the first and only treatment approved in the US for APDS  a rare and progressive primary immunodeficiency. The FDA evaluated the Joenja® application for APDS under Priority Review  which is granted to therapies that have the potential to provide significant improvements in the treatment  diagnosis or prevention of serious conditions. Joenja® is expected to launch in the US in early April and will be available for shipment in mid-April.Dr. Eveline Wu   MD  MSCR  Division Chief  Paediatric Rheumatology & Associate Professor of Paediatric Rheumatology and Allergy/Immunology at The University of North Carolina School of Medicine   said:""The FDA approval of Joenja® is an exciting moment for the APDS community and offers to transform the treatment pathway for patients and families affected by this rare disease. This approval means that they will  for the first time  have access to an approved treatment  which has the potential to change the standard of care for the patient population suffering from APDS.""Vicki Modell   co-founder of the Jeffrey Modell Foundation   an international  non-profit  organization dedicated to helping individuals and family members affected by primary immunodeficiency disorders  commented:""The approval of Pharming's Joenja® is an important step toward making a difference in the lives of individuals living with APDS who experience severe  life-altering and progressive symptoms. The FDA approval of a treatment option for one of the more than 450 primary immunodeficiencies is also a key moment for the broader primary immunodeficiency community. The Jeffrey Modell Foundation's mission of hope  advocacy and action is dedicated to early diagnosis  genetic sequencing  treatments and ultimately  future cures for primary immunodeficiencies.""Sijmen de Vries   Chief Executive Officer of Pharming   commented:""This FDA approval of Joenja® is an important milestone for people living with APDS who will now have access to the first approved treatment option specifically for this debilitating disease. Until now  management of APDS has relied on the treatment of the diverse symptoms associated with APDS. We are grateful to the patients  caregivers  and physicians who participated in the clinical trials who have made today's approval a reality. I would also like to thank the Pharming and the Novartis teams who have supported the development of Joenja® and can  therefore  be justifiably proud of this FDA approval. Today also marks a landmark event for Pharming and demonstrates our commitment to transforming the lives of patients who suffer from rare diseases. The approval and near-term launch of Joenja®  our second commercial product  brings us closer to our goal of becoming a leading global rare disease company dedicated to patient communities with unmet medical needs.""APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that was first characterized in 2013 and is currently estimated to affect 1 to 2 people per million. It is caused by genetic variants in either one of two identified genes  known as PIK3CD or PIK3R1  which are vital to the normal development and function of immune cells in the body. While people with APDS may suffer from a wide variety of symptoms  the most common are frequent and severe infections of the ears  sinuses  and upper and lower respiratory tracts. Infections usually begin in infancy. People with APDS are susceptible to swollen lymph nodes or an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly)  as well as autoimmunity and inflammatory symptoms. People with APDS may also be at higher risk for cancers like lymphoma.The FDA evaluated the New Drug Application (NDA) for Joenja® under priority review and has approved the drug based on findings from a multinational  triple-blind  placebo-controlled  randomized Phase II/III clinical trial  which evaluated efficacy and safety in 31 patients diagnosed with APDS aged 12 years and older. Also submitted as part of the application were data from a long-term  open-label extension clinical trial in which 38 patients received Joenja® for a median of two years.Results from the 12-week randomized  placebo-controlled study in 31 patients with APDS aged 12 years and older demonstrated clinical efficacy of Joenja® 70mg twice daily over placebo  and was significant in the co-primary endpoints which evaluated improvement in lymphoproliferation as measured by the reduction in lymph node size and increase in naïve B cells  reflecting the impact on immune dysregulation and normalization of immunophenotype in these patients  respectively. The adjusted mean change (95% CI) between Joenja® and placebo for lymph node size was -0.25 (–0.38 -0.12; P=0.0006; N=26) and for percentage of naïve B cells was 37.30 (24.06  50.54; P=0.0002; N=13). The most common adverse reactions in the clinical trial (incidence >10%) were headache  sinusitis  and atopic dermatitis.With the approval of Joenja®  as a treatment for a rare pediatric disease  the FDA granted Pharming a priority review voucher (""PRV""). Pursuant to the terms of Pharming's 2019 exclusive license agreement with Novartis for leniolisib  Novartis has the right to purchase the PRV from Pharming for a small minority share of the value of the PRV. Pursuant to the agreement  Pharming will make milestone payments to Novartis and another party for the approval and first commercial sale for APDS totaling $10.5 million and we agreed to make certain additional milestone payments to Novartis in an aggregate amount of up to $190 million upon the achievement of certain leniolisib sales milestones. We also agreed to make tiered royalty payments to Novartis  calculated as low double-digit to high-teen double-digit percentage of net sales of leniolisib.For more information regarding APDS  please visit AllAboutAPDS.com. Pharming   in collaboration with Invitae (NYSE: ) Corporation  facilitates access to no charge genetic testing and counseling in the US and Canada through NavigateAPDS.com. For more information regarding Pharming and their dedication to the rare disease community  please visit www.Pharming.com.The Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) for leniolisib with the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Human Medicinal Products (CHMP) is currently under review.

D. Mnangagwa  President of the Republic of Zimbabwe  during the International Renewable Energy Conference  in Victoria Falls.This Memorandum of Understanding was signed by Engineer John Diya  representing the Acting Managing Director of ZETDC  and Nicolas Lecomte  Director of HDF Energy for Southern and East Africa. It creates a framework for the joint technical and administrative work to complete the development of this first green hydrogen power plant investment in Zimbabwe  as well as the commercialization of its electricity and grid services  through a dedicated Power Purchase Agreement.HDF Energy is developing the Middle Sabi Renewstable® in the Chipinge District  Manicaland Province in Zimbabwe. The project is located in the southeast part of Zimbabwe  very far from the country's largest generation assets in the northwest. Benefits are thus created by locating generation of stable and dispatchable renewable energy closer to the demand load centers thus reducing transmission losses and increasing access to electricity for the local population. The plant will produce green power 24/7 feeding into the grid through the Middle Sabi Substation located 4 km from the project site. The annual electric production will be 178 GWh  providing electricity to more than 220 000 inhabitants.Middle Sabi Renewstable® is being developed within the multi-project  multi-technology  multi-investor Chipangayi Renewable Energy Technology Park (RETPark). RETPark has been under development since 2016  and has obtained all the initial permitting and studies to allow fast development of tenant investments.In line with the goals and key aspirations of the Government's National Development Strategy 1 (NDS1) and Vision 2030  this MoU supports the ambitious plan of the Government of Zimbabwe to support the development of over 1000 MW of solar projects by Independent Power Producers to help narrow the severe energy deficit currently being experienced in the country. This substantial roll out will require additional renewable baseload capacity to prevent challenges introduced to the grid by intermittent sources of power generation such as wind and solar: the firm  dispatchable  on-demand characteristics of the Middle Sabi Renewstable® will enhance the country's ability to expand this solar rollout program without the risk of causing instability to the grid  while still achieving its energy decarbonization targets. The Renewstable® power plant reduces exposure to imported fuels  price volatility and associated supply risks by using local sources of energy and thus helping to sustain domestic power generation.Furthermore  the cooperation between HDF Energy and ZETDC will kick-start implementation of green hydrogen investment and development of technical green hydrogen skills in Zimbabwe. This investment will meaningfully contribute to the GDP growth of Manicaland which has one of the lowest provincial GDP's per capita in Zimbabwe. There will be a positive impact on the livelihoods of the local community through the local jobs that will be created directly and indirectly  as well as HDF's corporate and social responsibility initiatives.Nicolas Lecomte  HDF Director for Southern and East Africa  said: “The electricity demand in the country is very high  in part because of the growth in demand by the productive sector  a positive sign for Zimbabwe's future. Our solution  the Renewstable® hydrogen power plant  is particularly suitable  not only to supply the necessary electricity  but also the network services to improve the stability and operating conditions of the electrical grid. The signing today is a key step in our engagement with the ZETDC for the project  that demonstrates the commitment of HDF to invest in the development work required to reach a bankable power purchase agreement with the utility. HDF expect to reach financial close on the project and start construction in 2024/2025.”Engineer John Diya  who represented the Acting Managing Director of ZETDC  said: “This is an encouraging milestone for ZETDC as it comes at a time when the Government is encouraging the transition to renewable energy. We are currently implementing initiatives to ensure security of electricity supply. Electricity is a key economic enabler  and we welcome such a partnership in a bid to bridge the demand/supply gap.”Laurent Chevalier  French ambassador to Zimbabwe attending the ceremony  declared: “France is strongly committed to addressing the global challenge of climate change and promoting the development of renewable energy  and I am glad to see French expertise in the innovative field of green hydrogen develop its presence in Zimbabwe. This project contributes in a concrete way to strengthening the economic relationship and the partnership between our two countries.”ABOUT HDF ENERGYHDF Energy is a global pioneer in high-power hydrogen power plants.

(""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM/Nasdaq: PHAR) announces that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Joenja® (leniolisib) for the treatment of activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kδ) syndrome (APDS) in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older. Joenja®  an oral  selective PI3Kδ inhibitor  is the first and only treatment approved in the US for APDS  a rare and progressive primary immunodeficiency. The FDA evaluated the Joenja® application for APDS under Priority Review  which is granted to therapies that have the potential to provide significant improvements in the treatment  diagnosis or prevention of serious conditions. Joenja® is expected to launch in the US in early April and will be available for shipment in mid-April.Dr. Eveline Wu  MD  MSCR  Division Chief  Paediatric Rheumatology & Associate Professor of Paediatric Rheumatology and Allergy/Immunology at The University of North Carolina School of Medicine  said:""The FDA approval of Joenja® is an exciting moment for the APDS community and offers to transform the treatment pathway for patients and families affected by this rare disease. This approval means that they will  for the first time  have access to an approved treatment  which has the potential to change the standard of care for the patient population suffering from APDS.""Vicki Modell  co-founder of the Jeffrey Modell Foundation  an international  non-profit  organization dedicated to helping individuals and family members affected by primary immunodeficiency disorders  commented:""The approval of Pharming's Joenja® is an important step toward making a difference in the lives of individuals living with APDS who experience severe  life-altering and progressive symptoms. The FDA approval of a treatment option for one of the more than 450 primary immunodeficiencies is also a key moment for the broader primary immunodeficiency community. The Jeffrey Modell Foundation's mission of hope  advocacy and action is dedicated to early diagnosis  genetic sequencing  treatments and ultimately  future cures for primary immunodeficiencies.""Sijmen de Vries  Chief Executive Officer of Pharming  commented:""This FDA approval of Joenja® is an important milestone for people living with APDS who will now have access to the first approved treatment option specifically for this debilitating disease. Until now  management of APDS has relied on the treatment of the diverse symptoms associated with APDS. We are grateful to the patients  caregivers  and physicians who participated in the clinical trials who have made today's approval a reality. I would also like to thank the Pharming and the Novartis teams who have supported the development of Joenja® and can  therefore  be justifiably proud of this FDA approval. Today also marks a landmark event for Pharming and demonstrates our commitment to transforming the lives of patients who suffer from rare diseases. The approval and near-term launch of Joenja®  our second commercial product  brings us closer to our goal of becoming a leading global rare disease company dedicated to patient communities with unmet medical needs.""APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that was first characterized in 2013 and is currently estimated to affect 1 to 2 people per million. It is caused by genetic variants in either one of two identified genes  known as PIK3CD or PIK3R1  which are vital to the normal development and function of immune cells in the body. While people with APDS may suffer from a wide variety of symptoms  the most common are frequent and severe infections of the ears  sinuses  and upper and lower respiratory tracts. Infections usually begin in infancy. People with APDS are susceptible to swollen lymph nodes or an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly)  as well as autoimmunity and inflammatory symptoms. People with APDS may also be at higher risk for cancers like lymphoma.The FDA evaluated the New Drug Application (NDA) for Joenja® under priority review and has approved the drug based on findings from a multinational  triple-blind  placebo-controlled  randomized Phase II/III clinical trial  which evaluated efficacy and safety in 31 patients diagnosed with APDS aged 12 years and older. Also submitted as part of the application were data from a long-term  open-label extension clinical trial in which 38 patients received Joenja® for a median of two years.Results from the 12-week randomized  placebo-controlled study in 31 patients with APDS aged 12 years and older demonstrated clinical efficacy of Joenja® 70mg twice daily over placebo  and was significant in the co-primary endpoints which evaluated improvement in lymphoproliferation as measured by the reduction in lymph node size and increase in naïve B cells  reflecting the impact on immune dysregulation and normalization of immunophenotype in these patients  respectively. The adjusted mean change (95% CI) between Joenja® and placebo for lymph node size was -0.25 (–0.38 -0.12; P=0.0006; N=26) and for percentage of naïve B cells was 37.30 (24.06  50.54; P=0.0002; N=13). The most common adverse reactions in the clinical trial (incidence >10%) were headache  sinusitis  and atopic dermatitis.With the approval of Joenja®  as a treatment for a rare pediatric disease  the FDA granted Pharming a priority review voucher (""PRV""). Pursuant to the terms of Pharming's 2019 exclusive license agreement with Novartis for leniolisib  Novartis has the right to purchase the PRV from Pharming for a small minority share of the value of the PRV. Pursuant to the agreement  Pharming will make milestone payments to Novartis and another party for the approval and first commercial sale for APDS totaling $10.5 million and we agreed to make certain additional milestone payments to Novartis in an aggregate amount of up to $190 million upon the achievement of certain leniolisib sales milestones. We also agreed to make tiered royalty payments to Novartis  calculated as low double-digit to high-teen double-digit percentage of net sales of leniolisib.For more information regarding APDS  please visit AllAboutAPDS.com. Pharming  in collaboration with Invitae Corporation  facilitates access to no charge genetic testing and counseling in the US and Canada through NavigateAPDS.com. For more information regarding Pharming and their dedication to the rare disease community  please visit www.Pharming.com.The Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) for leniolisib with the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Human Medicinal Products (CHMP) is currently under review. Pharming expects that CHMP will issue its opinion on the MAA in the second half of 2023.US Important Safety Information for Joenja® (leniolisib)INDICATIONS AND USAGEJoenja® (leniolisib) is a kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kδ) syndrome (APDS) in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONVerify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating treatment with Joenja®.Joenja® may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise patients of the potential risk to a fetus and to use highly effective methods of contraception during treatment with Joenja® and for 1 week after the last dose of Joenja®.Live  attenuated vaccinations may be less effective if administered during Joenja® treatment.Use of Joenja® in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment is not recommended. There is no recommended dosage for patients weighing less than 45 kg.The most common adverse reactions (incidence >10%) seen in clinical trials were headache  sinusitis  and atopic dermatitis.Seven (33%) patients receiving Joenja® developed an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) between 500 and 1500 cells/microL. No patients developed an ANC <500 cells/microL and there were no reports of infection associated with neutropenia.About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase δ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that was first characterized in 2013. APDS is caused by variants in either one of two identified genes known as PIK3CD or PIK3R1  which are vital to the development and function of immune cells in the body. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3Kδ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway  which causes immune cells to fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.1 2 3 APDS is characterized by a variety of symptoms  including severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.4 5 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  it has been reported that people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.6 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.4-7 A definitive diagnosis can be made through genetic testing. APDS affects approximately 1 to 2 people per million worldwide.About Joenja® (leniolisib)Joenja® (leniolisib) is an oral small molecule phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kẟ) inhibitor approved in the US as the first and only targeted treatment of activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kδ) syndrome (APDS) in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older. Joenja® inhibits the production of phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate  which serves as an important cellular messenger and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Results from a randomized  placebo-controlled Phase II/III clinical trial demonstrated clinical efficacy of Joenja® in the co-primary endpoints; demonstrating statistically significant impact on immune dysregulation and normalization of immunophenotype within these patients  and interim open label extension data has supported the safety and tolerability of long-term Joenja® administration.8 Leniolisib is currently under regulatory review by the European Medicines Agency  with plans to pursue further regulatory approvals in the UK  Canada  Australia and Japan. Leniolisib is also being evaluated in a Phase III clinical trial in children aged 4 to 11 with APDS  with a further trial planned in children aged 1 to 6 years with APDS.

As Shares held by the Trustee will be sourced from market purchases and are non-dilutive only Awards and Options sourced from the issue of Shares by the Company under this Plan or any other Employee Share Scheme will count for the purpose of the limits set out in the remainder of this Rule. The Remuneration Committee may decide to change the way in which it is intended that an Award or Option may be satisfied after it has been granted  having regard to the provisions of Rule 3.3.2 Ten per cent in ten yearsThe Remuneration Committee may not grant Awards or Options which might result in the issue of new Shares if it would have the effect of increasing the total number of Shares that have been  or may be issued  pursuant to awards and options granted under the Plan and any other employee share-based schemes of the Company in the ten year period preceding the proposed Date of Grant so as to exceed 10% of the Company's issued share capital at the Date of Grant.3.3 Five per cent in ten yearsThe Remuneration Committee may not grant Awards or Options which might result in the issue of new Shares if it would have the effect of increasing the total number of Shares that have been  or may be issued  pursuant to awards and options granted under the Plan and all other discretionary share-based schemes of the Company in the ten year period immediately preceding the proposed Date of Grant so as to exceed 5% of the Company's issued share capital at the Date of Grant.3.4 ComputationFor the purpose of the limits contained in this Rule 3:(a) Any Shares committed for issue under an Award or an Option shall be taken into account once only by reference to the date when the Award or Option is made. Treasury shares used to settle the Vesting of an Award or the exercise of an Option shall count as newly issued shares and shall be included in the calculation of the issued share capital for the purpose of calculating the limits until such time as guidelines published by institutional investor representative bodies recommend otherwise;(b) the limits shall count and apply to any Awards and Shares committed for issue under any sub plan or schedule created under Rule 17.5;(c) there shall be disregarded any Shares subject to an Award or Option which have lapsed  been renounced or refused or otherwise become incapable of Vesting;(d) Shares issued by the Company to holders of awards under any share based incentive scheme of Betfair or its subsidiaries: (i) in satisfaction of any right to acquire Shares granted to such persons in replacement of such awards at the time of and in connection with the merger of the Company and Betfair; and (ii) pursuant to the articles of association of Betfair as amended in connection with the merger of the Company and Betfair  shall be disregarded as shall any Shares delivered to such award holders by any trustee holding Shares for the benefit of former employees of Betfair or its subsidiaries;(e) there shall be disregarded any shares issued by Betfair under any share-based incentive scheme of Betfair or its subsidiaries during the ten-year period preceding any Date of Grant; and(f) no account shall be taken of any Shares where the right to receive such Shares has been or is to be satisfied other than by the issue or allotment of any part of the share capital of the Company or  for so long as treasury shares held by the Company count as newly issued shares under paragraph (a)  the transfer of treasury shares (including  without limitation  by the transfer of existing Shares (including  if they cease to count as newly issued shares under paragraph (a)  treasury shares held by the Company) or cash).4. Limit on Number of Shares Granted to Eligible EmployeesNo Eligible Employee may be granted Awards or Options which would  at the time they are granted  cause the value of all the Shares subject to Awards and/or Options granted under this Plan to that Eligible Employee to exceed (a) in a particular calendar year  in aggregate  1600% of his Base Salary at the time of grant and (b) in respect of the maximum value of Shares that may in the ordinary course Vest in a particular calendar year  400% of his Base Salary at the time of grant. For the avoidance of doubt  Shares which are the subject of an Award or Option will be valued based on their Market Value.5. Conditions Attaching to Awards and Options5.1 Imposition of ConditionsSubject to Rules 5.5 and 5.6  on the grant of an Award or an Option or at or around the time of the commencement of a relevant Performance Period  the Remuneration Committee may impose such conditions on Vesting or exercise which the Remuneration Committee determines to be appropriate in its absolute discretion.5.2 Nature of ConditionsAny condition imposed under Rule 5.1 shall:(a) be objective;(b) include a Performance Condition(s) determined by the Remuneration Committee (in its absolute discretion) which is appropriate to incentivise Eligible Employees to meet the Group's strategic goals; and(c) specify such other targets as the Remuneration Committee deems appropriate and be set out in  or attached in the form of a schedule to the Award Notification or Option Notification  as the case may be  or otherwise be the subject of a supplementary notification to the Participant.5.3 Substitution  variation or waiver of Conditions in respect of Awards or Options GrantedIf the Remuneration Committee considers that any condition imposed under Rule 5.2 is no longer appropriate or fair to Award Holders or Option Holders (e.g. due to the imposition of industry specific taxation changes including product fees)  it may make such adjustments to the Performance Condition calculations or substitute  vary or waive the condition (and make such consequential amendments to the Rules) in such manner as:(a) is reasonable in the circumstances; and(b) is neither materially more nor less difficult to satisfy than was intended at the Date of Grant.The outstanding Award or Option shall then take effect subject to the condition as so substituted  varied or waived.5.4 Notification of Award Holders and Option HoldersThe Remuneration Committee  as soon as is reasonably practicable  shall notify each Award Holder and Option Holder of any determination made by it under this Rule 5.5.5 Malus(a) Notwithstanding any other rule of the Plan  the Remuneration Committee may  in its absolute discretion and in circumstances in which the Remuneration Committee considers such action is appropriate  decide at any time prior to the Vesting of an Award or  in respect of that part of an Option that has not yet Vested and/or has Vested but has not been exercised  the second anniversary (or  where and to the extent specified in the Award Notification  such later anniversary as the Remuneration Committee may determine) specified in the Award of the date on which that part first becomes exercisable  that the Participant to whom the Award or Option was granted (in this Rule 5.5  the ""Relevant Participant"") shall be subject to Malus and may therefore decide to:(i) reduce the number of Shares to which the Award or Option relates;(ii) cancel the Award or Option;(iii) impose further conditions on the Award or Option; and / or(iv) delay the Vesting of the Award or the exercise of an Option if the action or conduct of the Relevant Participant  Group Member or relevant business unit is under investigation by the Company  or the Company has been notified by a regulatory authority that an investigation into such action or conduct has been commenced so that the delivery of the Shares in respect of such Award or Option will be delayed until any action or investigation is completed.(b) The circumstances in Rule 5.5(a) include  but are not limited to:(i) where there is a material restatement of the financial statements of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of the financial years ending after the grant of such Award or Option. The Remuneration Committee will in its sole discretion determine what constitutes a material restatement; or(ii) the financial statements of the Company used in assessing the number of Shares over which the Award or Option was granted were misstated  or that any other information relied on in making such assessment proves to have been incorrect and  in any case  the Award or Option was granted in respect of a greater number of Shares than would have been the case had there not been such a misstatement or reliance on incorrect information or had such error not been made or had such event not occurred; or(iii) the Remuneration Committee forms the view that in assessing the extent to which any Performance Condition and/or any other condition imposed on the Award or Option was satisfied such assessment was based on an error  or on inaccurate or misleading information or assumptions and that such error  information or assumptions resulted or would result either directly or indirectly in that Award or Option Vesting to a greater degree than would have been the case had that error not been made; or(iv) some or all of the Performance Conditions  which were deemed to have been satisfied in respect of the Award or Option have only been satisfied as a consequence of any direct or indirect manipulation on the part of the Relevant Participant. For the purpose of this Rule  ""manipulation"" means anything done  without the knowledge of the Remuneration Committee  for the Relevant Participant's own personal gain which is unreasonable and not done for the benefit of the Company; or(v) the Relevant Participant is guilty of serious misconduct  gross negligence or fraud; or(vi) the Group or part of the Group (in respect of which the Relevant Participant has performed any functions or oversight role)  in the reasonable opinion of the Remuneration Committee  following consultation with the risk committee of the Board  if applicable  suffered a material failure of risk management; or(vii) any Group Member or a relevant business unit. (in respect of which the Relevant Participant has performed any functions or oversight role)  in the reasonable opinion of the Remuneration Committee suffered a material corporate failure; or(viii) the censure of the Company  any Group Member or a relevant business unit by a regulatory authority or events having a significant detrimental impact (as reasonably determined by the Remuneration Committee) on the reputation of the Company  any Group Member or a relevant business unit  where the Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the Relevant Participant was responsible for the censure or reputational damage and that the censure or reputational damage is attributable to them; or(ix) the Group or part of the Group (in respect of which the Relevant Participant has performed any functions or oversight role) receives notification in writing that it may become subject to any regulatory sanctions  where the Remuneration Committee forms the view that the conduct of the Relevant Participant contributed to the circumstances leading to such notification.5.6 Clawback of Awards or Options(a) The Remuneration Committee may decide at any time up to the second anniversary (or  where and to the extent specified in the Award Notification  such later anniversary as the Remuneration Committee may determine) of the Vesting of an Award or  in the case of an Option  in respect of that part of the Option that has been exercised  up to the second anniversary (or  where and to the extent specified in the Award Notification  such later anniversary as the Remuneration Committee may determine) of the date on which that part of the Option first became exercisable  that the person to whom the Award or Option was granted (in this Rule 5.6  the ""Relevant Participant"") shall be subject to clawback for any of the following:(i) there is a material restatement of the financial statements of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of the financial years ending after the grant of such Award or Option. The Remuneration Committee will in its sole discretion determine what constitutes a material restatement; or(ii) the financial statements of the Company used in assessing the number of Shares over which the Award or Option was granted were misstated  or that any other information relied on in making such assessment proves to have been incorrect and  in any case  the Award or Option was granted in respect of a greater number of Shares than would have been the case had there not been such a misstatement or reliance on incorrect information or had such error not been made or had such event not occurred; or(iii) the Remuneration Committee forms the view that  in assessing the extent to which any Performance Condition and/or any other condition imposed on the Award or Option was satisfied  such assessment was based on an error  or on inaccurate or misleading information or assumptions and that such error  information or assumptions resulted either directly or indirectly in that Award Vesting to a greater degree than would have been the case had that error not been made; or(iv) some or all of the Performance Conditions  which were deemed to have been satisfied in respect of the Award or Option have only been satisfied as a consequence of any direct or indirect manipulation on the part of the Relevant Participant.

or(x) the Group or part of the Group (in respect of which the Relevant Participant has performed any functions or oversight role) receives notification in writing that it may become subject to any regulatory sanctions  where the Remuneration Committee forms the view that the conduct of the Relevant Participant contributed to the circumstances leading to such notification; or(xi) the Relevant Participant is in breach of any applicable restrictions on competition  solicitation or the use of confidential information (whether arising out of the Relevant Participant's employment contract  his termination arrangements or any internal policies).(b) Where the Remuneration Committee decides that an Award or Option is subject to Clawback:(i) the Remuneration Committee may require the Relevant Participant to forfeit the right to all or part of the Shares which would  but for the operation of this Rule 5.6  be transferable to the Relevant Participant in respect of such Award or Option; and/or(ii) the Remuneration Committee may reduce (including  if appropriate  reducing to zero):(A) the amount of the next bonus (if any) which would  but for the operation of Rule 5.6(a) be payable to the Relevant Participant under any bonus plan operated by any Group Member;

Grant of OptionsOptions may be granted by the Remuneration Committee in favour of Eligible Employees in respect of Shares sourced from the Trustee or from the Company with the price payable by the Option Holder on exercise being zero  in the case of Shares sourced from the Trustee  or the aggregate nominal value of the Shares the subject of the Option (which shall be paid by the Group Member which employs the Option Holder or the Trustee  if so agreed  as the case may be)  in the case of Shares sourced from the unissued share capital of the Company  with the performance period being the same as the Performance Period and the performance conditions being the same as those applicable to Awards granted under the terms of the Plan. The provisions of this Plan which apply to Awards shall also apply to Options with all necessary modifications and changes as determined by the Remuneration Committee. All such Options shall be granted on the basis that they shall be exercisable within a period of less than ten years after the Date of Grant (or such shorter period as may be determined on the Date of Grant) where the exercise price is less than the Market Value at the Date of Grant.7. Vesting of Awards and Options7.1 Vesting of Awards and OptionsSubject to Rules 8 and 9  an Award may Vest and an Option may become exercisable on such date as may be specified by the Remuneration Committee after the date on which the relevant Performance Condition applicable in respect of a Performance Period (in its original form or as substituted or varied from time to time)  has been determined by the Remuneration Committee to be satisfied provided that no Award Holder shall be entitled to Vest such Award and no Option Holder entitled to exercise an Option earlier than the later of the (i) third anniversary of the Date of Grant thereof and (ii) the anniversary of the Date of Grant immediately following the third anniversary of the commencement of the relevant Performance Period.The Remuneration Committee may adjust the Vesting or exercise dates and limits set out herein and the Performance Period in its absolute discretion to take account of any change in the Company's Accounting Period which may occur during the period commencing on the Date of Grant of an Award or Option and ending on the date such Award or Option Vests.The Remuneration Committee may adjust the Vesting outcome (either up or down) in respect of a Performance Period in its absolute discretion to ensure that the overall outcome reflects underlying business performance or the Participant's overall performance over the Performance Period.7.2 Award and Option Holders to be employed within the GroupExcept as otherwise provided in Rule 8  an Award may Vest or an Option may be exercised only while the Award Holder or Option Holder is employed within the Group and if he ceases to be employed within the Group  any Award or Option granted to him shall lapse to the extent that it has not Vested or been exercised prior to the date of such cessation.7.3 Effect of any Dealing Restriction PeriodIf an Award becomes capable of Vesting or an Option capable of exercise during a period when a Dealing Restriction applies  the holder thereof shall not become entitled to receive the Shares nor shall the Trustee or the Company be under any obligation to deliver the Shares until the Dealing Restriction ends notwithstanding any other provision contained in these Rules.7.4 Acquisition of Shares for Awards and Options(a) The Company may from time to time fund the Trustee as and when the Trustee requires funds to purchase Shares in the market or otherwise;(b) In circumstances determined by the Remuneration Committee  in its absolute discretion  a request may be made to the Trustee to satisfy the obligation to deliver Shares on Award Vesting or Option exercise to any Award Holder or Option Holder (other than an executive director) by the payment to the Award Holder or Option Holder  as the case may be  of a cash payment equal to the aggregate Market Value of the Shares the subject of such Award or Option (the ""Net Payment"").7.5 Post Vesting Holding PeriodThe Remuneration Committee  in its absolute discretion  may at any time  impose on an Award Holder or Option Holder  as the case may be  the requirement to retain Shares derived from any Award or Option or any Net Payment for such period  and on such conditions as it shall determine in its absolute discretion  provided that in specifying the number of such Shares  or the amount of the Net Payment  to be held  due regard shall be had to the need for such holders to discharge taxation  social charge and social insurance liabilities arising on the Vesting or exercise of any such Award or Option or the receipt of any Net Payment  as the case maybe  and provided further that the Remuneration Committee shall be entitled to impose such a requirement on one Award Holder or Option Holder but not on another (a ""Retention Restriction""). Unless the Remuneration Committee determines otherwise  all Shares (after any sale required to discharge taxation  social charge and social insurance liabilities arising on the Vesting or exercise of any such Award or Option) received by a director of the Company in respect of an Award or Option shall be subject to a Retention Restriction until the anniversary of the Date of Grant of such Award or Option next following the end of its final Performance Period.8. Cessation of Employment8.1 Notwithstanding  the provisions of Rules 7.1 and 7.2  if a Participant ceases to be employed by a Group Member before or after his Award is capable of Vesting or Option is capable of exercise  as the case may be  by reason of:(a) death;(b) ill health  injury or disability evidenced to the satisfaction of the Company;(c) redundancy (within the meaning of the Redundancy Payments Acts 1967 to 2014 or any overseas equivalent) if the Company so decides;(d) retirement  with the agreement of the Company; or(e) his office or employment being with either a company which ceases to be a Group Member or relating to a business or part of a business which is transferred to a person who is not a Group Member; or(f) for any other reason  if the Remuneration Committee so decides his Award or Option shall lapse except to the extent it is already Vested or it Vests as provided in Rule 8.3 or except as the Remuneration Committee shall otherwise determine  and such lapse be effective either on (i) the date of cessation of employment with the Group Member or (ii) such other date as shall be determined by the Remuneration Committee in its absolute discretion (including  but not limited to  the date on which any post cessation restrictive covenants entered into by the Participant expire).8.2 Any Option which does not lapse immediately on cessation of the Participant's employment with the Group Member shall lapse unless exercised by the Participant or by his personal representative within a period of six months (or such other period as determined by the Remuneration Committee in its discretion) after: (a) if applicable  the date on which the Option becomes exercisable having been excepted from lapse in accordance with Rule 8.1; or (b) in the case of an Option which was already exercisable on the date of cessation of employment  either (x) the date of cessation of employment with the Group Member  or (y) such other date as shall be determined by the Remuneration Committee in its absolute discretion (including  but not limited to  the date on which any post cessation restrictive covenants entered into by the Participant expire)  PROVIDED ALWAYS THAT no Option shall be capable of exercise after the expiry of either (i) ten years from the Date of Grant thereof or (ii) such shorter exercise period as was determined on the Date of Grant.8.3 Subject to Rules 8.4 to 8.6  the number of Shares in respect of which Vesting or exercise may occur shall be determined by the Remuneration Committee in its absolute discretion  taking into account  in respect of each Performance Period:(a) the extent to which any Performance Condition applicable to that Performance Period has been satisfied either (as determined by the Remuneration Committee) at the date of cessation of office or employment or at the end of the original Performance Period; and(b) unless the Remuneration Committee determines otherwise  the period of time (if any) that has elapsed from the commencement of the that Performance Period to the date of cessation of office or employment and to the extent that an Award does not Vest  or an Option does not become exercisable  in each case in full  the remainder will lapse immediately.8.4 The Remuneration Committee may  at any time prior to the date of eventual exercise  and in its absolute discretion  revoke any determination under Rule 8.1 to permit an Award or Option to continue for any reason including (without limitation) a breach by the Award Holder or Option Holder of any restrictive covenants contained within his or her employment contract or any settlement agreement in respect of termination of his employment or otherwise  in which case the Award or Option shall lapse immediately from the date of such revocation.8.5 An Award Holder or Option Holder shall not be treated for the purposes of these Rules as ceasing to be employee until such time as he is no longer an employee or an officer of any Group Member.8.6 Where an Award Holder or Option Holder's contract of employment with the Group is terminated:(a) without notice  such employment shall be deemed to cease on the date on which the termination takes effect;(b) by a Group Member with a payment in lieu of notice  such employment shall be deemed to cease on the date on which the termination takes effect and shall not include notice not worked; and(c) where the said contract is terminated by notice given by a Group Member or by an Award Holder or Option Holder  such employment shall be deemed to cease on the date on which that notice expires.8.7 Retention Restriction ReleaseThe Remuneration Committee  in its absolute discretion  may release any Shares or any Net Payment the subject of a Retention Restriction after an Award Holder or Option Holder ceases to be employed for any of the reasons set out in Rule 8.1 or for such other reason as the Remuneration Committee  in its absolute discretion  may decide.8.8 Award Holder Relocating AbroadNotwithstanding any other provision of these Rules  if it is proposed that an Award Holder or Option Holder (who is not an executive director of the Company)  while continuing to be an Eligible Employee  shall work in a country other than the country in which he is currently working and  by reason of such change he:(a) suffers less favourable tax treatment in respect of his Awards or Options; or(b) becomes subject to a restriction that impedes or limits the issuance or transfer of the Shares subject to an Award or Option or limits or impedes his ability to hold or deal with such Shares his Award or Option  at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee  may (i) either Vest or be exercised  as the case may be  in whole or in part  at such time or times as the Remuneration Committee shall determine; or (ii) be adjusted in a manner designed to overcome in whole or in part  such treatment or restriction.9. Takeover  Reconstruction  Amalgamation or Winding-Up of the Company9.1 Corporate EventsWhere any of the events described in Rule 9.2 occur  then subject to Rules 10 and 11  Awards and Option will Vest in accordance with Rule 9.3 at the time of such event unless they Vest earlier in accordance with Rule 9.4(b). Subject to Rule 9.3 Options will be exercisable for 30 days from the date of the relevant event described in Rule 9.2  after which all Options will lapse.9.2 Relevant EventsThe events referred to in Rule 9.1 are:(a) General offerIf any person (either alone or together with any person Acting in Concert with him)(i) obtains Control of the Company as a result of making a general offer to acquire Shares; or(ii) already having Control of the Company  makes an offer to acquire all of the Shares other than those which are already owned by him and such offer becomes wholly unconditional.(b) Scheme of arrangementA compromise or arrangement in accordance with Chapter 1 of Part 9 of the Companies Act 2014 for the purposes of a change of Control of the Company is sanctioned by the Court.(c) Winding-upOn the passing of a resolution for the voluntary winding-up or the making of an order for the compulsory winding up of the Company.9.3 Determination of the Remuneration Committee(a) An Award or Option will Vest pursuant to Rule 9.1 taking into account all factors which the Remuneration Committee considers relevant  the extent to which the Performance Condition has been satisfied and  unless the Remuneration Committee determines otherwise  the period of time from the commencement of the relevant Performance Period to the date of the relevant event. To the extent that an Award or Option does not Vest  or is not exchanged in accordance with Rule 10  it will lapse immediately.(b) Any reference to the Remuneration Committee in this Rule 9 means the members of the Remuneration Committee immediately prior to the relevant event which is the subject of this Rule 9.9.4 Other Events(a) If the Company is or may be affected by a merger with another company  demerger  delisting  special dividend or other event which  in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee  may affect the current or future value of Shares:(i) the Remuneration Committee may determine that an Award or Option will Vest or must be exercised conditionally on the event occurring;(ii) if the event does not occur then the conditional Vesting or exercise will not be effective and the Award or Option will continue to subsist;(iii) if an Award or Option Vests under this Rule 9.4  it will Vest taking into account the extent to which any Performance Condition has been satisfied at the date of the relevant event and  unless the Remuneration Committee determines otherwise  the period of time from the date of commencement of the relevant Performance Period to the date of the relevant event; and(iv) to the extent that an Award or Option does not Vest  it will lapse immediately.The Remuneration Committee will then also determine the period during which any Vested Option may be exercised  after which time it will lapse.(b) If the Remuneration Committee determines that there would be any adverse tax consequence if an Award or Option were to Vest on or after an event described in this Rule 9  then the Remuneration Committee may resolve that Awards will Vest on an earlier date.9.5 Discretion of Remuneration CommitteeIn determining the basis of Vesting or exercise of Awards or Options  as the case may be  in the circumstances set out in Rules 9.1 to 9.4 or the release of a Retention Restriction in respect of Shares derived from Awards or Options or a Net Payment  the Remuneration Committee  acting fairly and reasonably  may take such actions as it considers fair in the circumstances.10. Exchange of Awards and Options on Takeover of the Company10.1 An Award will not Vest or an Option will not become exercisable under Rule 9 but will be exchanged on the terms set out in Rule 10 to the extent that:(a) an offer to exchange the Award (the ""Existing Award"") or Option (the ""Existing Option"") is made and accepted by a Participant;(b) there is an Internal Reorganisation; or(c) the Remuneration Committee decides (before the event) that an Existing Award or Existing Option will be exchanged automatically.10.2 If Rule 10.1 applies  the Existing Award will not Vest or Existing Option will not become exercisable but will be exchanged in consideration of the issue of a new award (the ""New Award"") or new option (the ""New Option"") which  in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee  is equivalent to the Existing Award or Existing Option  but relates to shares in a different company (whether the acquiring company or a different company) (""New Shares"").10.3 The New Award or New Option shall not be regarded for the purposes of this Rule 10 as equivalent to the Award or the Option unless:(a) save for any condition imposed under Rule 5.1  the New Award or the New Option shall Vest or be exercised  as the case may be  in the same manner as the Award and the Option and subject to the same provisions of the Plan as it had effect immediately before the release of the Award or Option  as the case may be;(b) the aggregate Market Value of the shares which are the subject of the New Award or the New Option is the same as the maximum possible amount which would have been received where the Award or Option become exercisable in its entirety; and(c) the total amount payable by the Award Holder or the Option Holder for the acquisition of the New Shares under the New Award or the New Option  as the case may be  is as nearly as may be equal to the total amount that would have been payable by the Award Holder or the Option Holder for the acquisition of the Shares under the Award or the Option  as the case may be.10.4 The date of grant of the New Award or New Option shall be deemed to be the same as the Date of Grant of the Award or the Option  as the case may be.10.5 In the application of the Plan to the New Award or the New Option  where appropriate  references to ""Company"" and ""Shares"" shall be read as if they were references to the company to whose shares the New Award or New Option  as the case may be  relates and the New Shares respectively  save that in the definition of ""Committee"" the reference to ""Company"" shall be read as if it were a reference to Flutter Entertainment plc.11. Lapse of Awards and OptionsIn addition to any other Rule providing for lapsing  an Award or Option shall lapse on the earliest of:11.1 subject to Rules 8.1 and 8.2  the date specified in the Award Notification or Option Notification for lapsing;11.2 the Remuneration Committee determining that any condition imposed under Rule 5.1 has not been satisfied in relation to the Award or Option and can no longer be satisfied either in whole or in part; and11.3 the date on which a resolution is passed or an order is made by the court for the compulsory winding up of the Company.12. Shares Transferred/Issued on Vesting12.1 Rights attaching to SharesPrior to Vesting or exercise an Award Holder or Option Holder  as the case may be  shall have no right over or in respect of any Shares which are capable of being acquired or held for the benefit of the Award Holder or Option Holder under the relevant Award or Option. On the Vesting of an Award or exercise of an Option  the relevant Shares shall  as to voting  dividend and other rights  including those arising on a liquidation of the Company  rank equally in all respects and as one class with the Shares in issue at the date of such Vesting and the Award Holder or Option Holder  as the case may be  shall be entitled to all rights attaching to such Shares arising by reference to a record date after the date of Vesting or exercise.12.2 Dividend EquivalentsSubject to Rule 12.3  upon the Vesting of an Award or part thereof in respect of Shares sourced from the Trustee an Award Holder shall be entitled to receive such number of additional Shares  calculated by the Company (in its absolute discretion)  by dividing the amount of dividends which would have been paid on a dividend payment date in respect of the number of Shares which are Vesting in the period commencing on the Date of Grant and ending on the day prior to Vesting in respect of that Performance Period by the price of a Share on the Official List of the Stock Exchange at the close of business on the relevant dividend payment day. If there are more than one dividend payment days in the period  the number of Shares shall be the aggregate of such calculations (the ""Dividend Shares""). The Dividend Shares shall form part of the Award for all purposes and be subject to the terms and conditions set out in these Rules as if they formed part of the Award ab initio. The entitlement to Dividend Shares shall only arise upon the Vesting of the original Award of which they form part and the Award Holder shall have no right or interest of any kind in respect of these Shares unless and until the Vesting of the original Award occurs. If an Award shall Vest in part the number of Dividend Shares the Award Holder shall receive shall be reduced so that the Dividend Shares received shall bear the same proportion to the total number of Dividend Shares as the proportion that the Award that Vests bears to the entire Award.Upon the Vesting of an Award  or part thereof  in respect of Shares sourced from the unissued share capital of the Company  the Remuneration Committee  in its absolute discretion  may determine to procure that the Board shall allot such additional number of Shares as shall equal the entitlement to Dividend Shares that would have been transferred to the Award Holder had he received an Award or Shares sourced from the pool of Shares held by the Trustee.An Option Holder shall be entitled to Dividend Shares on the same basis as an Award Holder with the calculation of the amount of his dividend entitlement being based on the amount of dividends that would have been payable on the Shares the subject of the Option in the period commencing on the Date of Grant and ending on the earliest date the relevant Options (or part thereof) could have been exercised had such Shares been in issue.12.3 ExclusionThe automatic entitlement of an Award Holder to Dividend Shares under the provisions of Rule 12.2 shall not apply to Dividend Shares that may be funded from any special or exceptional dividend payable by the Company and  in such circumstances  the Remuneration Committee shall determine  in its absolute discretion  whether or not a Dividend Share entitlement shall arise.For the avoidance of any doubt  the proceeds payable to the Trustee in respect of any repurchase by the Company of Shares from the Employee Benefit Trust are not within the remit of Rule 12.2.13. Adjustment of Awards and Options on Reorganisation and Exercise of Discretion13.1 Power to adjust Awards and OptionThe number of Shares subject to an Award or an Option and/or any Performance Condition applicable thereto may be adjusted in such manner as the Remuneration Committee determines  in the event of:(a) any variation of the share capital of the Company; or(b) a merger with another company  demerger  delisting  special dividend  rights issue or other event which may  in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee  affect the current or future value of Shares.13.2 Notification of Award Holders and Option HolderThe Remuneration Committee shall  as soon as reasonably practicable  notify each Award Holder and Option Holder of any adjustment made under this Rule 13. The Remuneration Committee may call in for endorsement or cancellation and re-issue of any Award Notification or Option Notification in order to take account of such adjustment.13.3 Exercise of DiscretionAny decision to exercise a discretion provided for in any of Rules 2  5  7 and 8 in respect of a Participant  who is not an executive director of the Company  may be made by a person or persons duly authorised by the Remuneration Committee.14.

Failure to return the accepted/signed document by the specified date shall cause the Award or Option to lapse.15.

By participating in the Plan  a Participant waives all rights to compensation for any loss in relation to the Plan  including:(a) any loss of office or employment;(b) any loss or reduction of any rights  benefits or expectations in relation to the Plan in any circumstances or for any reason  including lawful or unlawful termination of the Participant's employment;(c) any exercise of a discretion or a decision taken in relation to an Award or to the Plan  or any failure to exercise a discretion or take a decision;(d) the operation  suspension  termination or amendment of the Plan.15.8 Each of the provisions of each Rule of the Plan is entirely separate and independent from each of the other provisions of each Rule. If any provision is found to be invalid then it will be deemed never to have been part of the Rules and to the extent that it is possible to do so  this will not affect the validity or enforceability of any of the remaining provisions of the Rules.15.9 No representation or guarantee is given in respect of the future value of the Shares which are the subject of any Awards. Each Award is made on the basis that the Participant accepts that such value is unknown  indeterminable and cannot be predicted with certainty.

Limit on Number of Shares to be the subject of Awards under this Plan3.1 GeneralThe number of Shares which may be the subject of Awards shall be limited as set out in this Rule 3.For the purpose of Awards granted under this Plan  Shares may be sourced from the pool of Shares held by the Trustee or  as determined by the Remuneration Committee  by the issue of new Shares by the Company (which shall include treasury shares held by the Company). As Shares held by the Trustee will be sourced from market purchases and are non-dilutive  only Awards sourced from the issue of Shares by the Company will count for the purpose of the limits set out in the remainder of this Rule. The Remuneration Committee may decide to change the way in which it is intended that an Award granted as a Nil-Cost Option may be satisfied after it has been granted  having regard to the provisions of Rule 3.2.3.2 10% and 5% LimitsSubject to the provisions as to Adjustment of Awards in Rule 14 in the ten years preceding any given day  the aggregate number of Shares in the Company committed for issue under:-(a) all share plans operated by the Company shall not exceed 10 per cent of the shares in issue immediately prior to that day; and(b) this Plan and all other discretionary executive incentive share plans shall not exceed 5 per cent of the Shares in issue immediately prior to that day.3.3 ComputationFor the purpose of the limits contained in this Rule 3:(a) any Shares committed for issue under an Award shall be taken into account once only by reference to the date when the Award is made;(b) treasury shares used to settle the Vesting of a Conditional Award or the exercise of a Nil-Cost Option shall count as newly issued Shares until such time as guidelines published by institutional investor representative bodies recommend otherwise;(c) the limits shall count and apply to any Awards and Shares committed for issue under any Award granted under any sub plan created under Rule 16.4;(d) no account shall be taken of any Shares where the right to receive such Shares has been or is to be satisfied other than by the issue or allotment of any part of the share capital of the Company (including  without limitation  by the transfer of existing shares or by cash);(e) there shall be disregarded any Shares subject to a Conditional Award or Nil-Cost Option which have lapsed  been renounced or refused or otherwise become incapable of Vesting;(f) Shares issued by the Company to holders of awards under any share based incentive scheme of Betfair or its subsidiaries: (i) in satisfaction of any right to acquire Shares granted to such persons in replacement of such awards at the time of and in connection with the merger of the Company and Betfair; and (ii) pursuant to the articles of association of Betfair as amended in connection with the merger of the Company and Betfair  shall be disregarded as shall any Shares delivered to such award holders by any trustee holding Shares for the benefit of former employees of Betfair or its subsidiaries; and(g) there shall be disregarded any shares issued by Betfair under any Betfair share based incentive scheme of Betfair or its subsidiaries during the ten year period preceding any Award Date.3.4 Individual LimitsExcept in the case of a Buy-out Award  no Participant may be granted Awards which would  at the time they are granted  cause the value of all the Shares subject to Awards granted under this Scheme to that Participant to exceed (a) in a particular calendar year  in aggregate  1600% of his Base Salary at the time of grant and (b) in respect of the maximum value of Shares that may in the ordinary course Vest in a particular calendar year  400% of his Base Salary at the time of grant. For the avoidance of doubt  Shares which are the subject of an Award will be valued based on their Market Value.4. Performance Conditions4.1 Unless the Remuneration Committee determines otherwise  the Vesting of Awards will not be subject to the satisfaction of a Performance Condition.4.2 When issuing any Award  the Remuneration Committee may determine that Performance Conditions shall apply to all or part of the Award and in doing so shall specify the Performance Conditions which must be satisfied before the Award can Vest. Subject to Rules 11 and 12  any Performance Condition will be measured over the Performance Period.4.3 Where the Award is subject to Performance Conditions and circumstances arise which cause the Remuneration Committee to consider that:(a) a substituted or amended Performance Condition would be more appropriate and or if the Remuneration Committee considers that any Performance Condition is no longer appropriate or fair to Eligible Employees (e.g. due to the imposition of industry specific taxation changes including product fees); or(b) the level of Vesting resulting from the application of the Performance Condition and/or any other conditions is not a fair and accurate reflection of the performance of the Company  the Group or any Group Member(s); and/or(c) the level of Vesting resulting from the application of the Performance Condition and/or any other conditions is not a fair and accurate reflection of the performance of the Participant; and/or(d) there is any other factor or there are any other circumstances which would make the level of Vesting resulting from the application of the Performance Condition and/or any other conditions inappropriate without adjustment;it may substitute  vary or waive the Performance Condition in such manner as:(i) is reasonable in the circumstances; and(ii) (in the case of a new Performance Condition) is neither materially more nor less difficult to satisfy;so that the relevant Award shall then take effect subject to the Performance Condition as so substituted  varied or waived and/or the level of Vesting of the relevant Award shall be thereby adjusted upwards or downwards (including for the avoidance of doubt to nil) by the application of the Performance Condition as so substituted  varied or waived.4.4 Where the Award is subject to Performance Conditions and subject to Rules 11 and 12  the Participant shall receive all or part of the Shares which are the subject of the Award depending on the extent to which the Remuneration Committee determines that the Performance Conditions have been satisfied in respect of such Award (or part thereof). The Remuneration Committee shall make such determination as soon as reasonably practicable after the end of the Performance Period relating to an Award which is subject to the satisfaction of a Performance Condition (or part thereof). To the extent that an Award does not Vest in full  the remainder will lapse immediately.5. Restrictions on Transfer and Bankruptcy5.1 An Award shall not be capable of being transferred  charged or otherwise alienated (except in the event of the Participant's death  to his personal representatives)  without the prior approval  in writing  of the Remuneration Committee  and shall lapse immediately if the Participant purports to transfer  charge or otherwise alienate the Award without such approval. All of the terms of this Plan shall apply to any Award so transferred  charged or alienated.5.2 An Award will lapse immediately if the Participant is declared bankrupt or enters into a compromise with his creditors generally.6. Dividend Equivalents6.1 Prior to the Vesting of a Conditional Award or so long as a Nil-Cost Option remains unexercised  a Participant will have no rights (including any voting rights  dividend paid or other distributions that may be made) in respect of the Shares subject to his Conditional Award or Nil-Cost Option.6.2 Subject to Rule 6.5  upon the Vesting of an Award  or part of  in respect of Shares sourced from the Trustee  the Participant shall be entitled to receive such number of additional Shares  calculated by the Company (in its absolute discretion)  by dividing the amount of dividends which would have been paid on a dividend payment day in respect of the number of Shares which are vesting in the period commencing on the Award Date of such Award and ending on the day prior to Vesting by the price of a Share on the Official List of the Stock Exchange at the close of business on the relevant dividend payment day. If there are more than one dividend payment days in the period  the number of Shares shall be the aggregate of such calculations (the ""Dividend Shares""). The Dividend Shares shall form part of the Award for all purposes and be subject to the terms and conditions set out in these Rules as if they formed part of the Award ab initio. The entitlement to Dividend Shares shall only arise upon the Vesting of the original Award of which they form part and the Participant shall have no right or interest of any kind in respect of these Shares unless and until the Vesting of the original Award occurs. If an Award shall Vest in part the number of Dividend Shares the Participant shall receive shall be reduced so that the Dividend Shares received shall bear the same proportion to the total number of Dividend Shares as the proportion that the Award that Vests bears to the entire Award.6.3 Upon the Vesting of an Award  or part of  in respect of Shares sourced from the unissued share capital of the Company  the Remuneration Committee  in its absolute discretion  may determine to procure that the Board shall allot such additional number of Shares as shall equal the entitlement to Dividend Shares that would have been transferred to the Participant had he received an Award or Shares sourced from the pool of Shares held by the Trustee.6.4 A Participant holding a Nil-Cost Option shall be entitled to Dividend Shares on the same basis as the holder of an Award with the calculation of the amount of his dividend entitlement being based on the amount of dividends that would have been payable on the Shares the subject of the Nil-Cost Option in the period commencing on the Award Date and ending on the earliest date the relevant Nil-Cost Options could have been exercised had such Shares been in issue.6.5 The entitlement of a Participant to Dividend Shares under the provisions of Rule 6.2 shall not apply to Dividend Shares that may be funded from any special or exceptional dividend payable by the Company and  in such circumstances  the Remuneration Committee shall determine  in its absolute discretion  whether or not a Dividend Share entitlement shall arise.6.6 For the avoidance of any doubt  the proceeds payable to the Trustee in respect of any repurchase by the Company of Shares from the Paddy Power plc Employee Benefit Trust are not within the remit of Rule 6.2.7. Vesting and Exercise7.1 Subject to Rules 9  11 and 12  a Conditional Award will Vest;(a) on the Normal Vesting Date; or(b) if on the Normal Vesting Date (or on any other date on which a Award is due to Vest under Rule 11 or 12) a Dealing Restriction applies to the Award  on the date on which such Dealing Restriction lifts.7.2 In relation to an Award in the form of a Conditional Award  at any time prior to the Vesting of that Award  the Remuneration Committee may determine that no Shares shall be transferred to the Participant and if it does  it shall:(a) grant a Nil-Cost Option which shall be exercisable in respect of such number of Shares as is equal to the number of Shares which were the subject of the Conditional Award  together with any additional Shares or cash to which a Participant becomes entitled under Rule 6. If the Participant is tax resident in Ireland at the Award Date  such Nil-Cost Option shall not be capable of being exercised after the seventh anniversary of the Award Date. In all other cases  such Nil-Cost Option shall not be capable of being exercised after the tenth anniversary of the Award Date; or(b) pay the Cash Equivalent to the Participant as provided for in Rule 10.7.3 The Vesting of a Conditional Award  the exercise of a Nil-Cost Option  the transfer of Shares and the sale of such Shares under this Plan will be subject to obtaining any approval or consent required by any relevant authority  any Dealing Restrictions and any other applicable laws or regulations in any jurisdiction.7.4 Except as otherwise provided in Rule 11  a Conditional Award may Vest or a Nil-Cost Option may be exercised only while the Participant is employed by a Group Member and if he ceases to be employed by a Group Member  any Conditional Award or Nil-Cost Option granted to him shall lapse to the extent that it has not Vested prior to the date of such cessation.7.5 Subject to Rules 9 and 10 where Shares are to be delivered to a Participant as a consequence of the Vesting of a Conditional Award or the exercise of a Nil-Cost Option  the Shares may be:(a) new Shares issued by the Company and the Trustee may fund the payment of the issue price of such Shares (which shall not be less than the nominal value of the Shares) using funds in the Employee Benefit Trust;(b) treasury Shares reissued for nil consideration by the Company; or(c) existing Shares which will be transferred by the Trustee to the Participant and the Company or another Group Member may fund the purchase of such Shares.In each case the Shares shall be delivered to the Participant within 30 days of the Vesting of a Conditional Award or the exercise of a Nil-Cost Option.7.6 The Company may from time to time fund the Trustee as and when the Trustee requires funds to purchase Shares in the market or otherwise.7.7 The Remuneration Committee  in its absolute discretion  may at any time  impose on a Participant  as the case may be  the requirement to retain Shares derived from any Award for such period  and on such conditions as it shall determine in its absolute discretion  provided that in specifying the number of such Shares to be held  due regard shall be had to the need for such Participant to discharge taxation liabilities arising on the Vesting or exercise of any such Award and provided further that the Remuneration Committee shall be entitled to impose such a requirement on one Participant but not on another (a ""Retention Restriction"").8. Malus and Clawback8.1 Malus(a) Notwithstanding any other rule of the Plan  the Remuneration Committee may  in its absolute discretion and in circumstances in which the Remuneration Committee considers such action is appropriate  decide at any time prior to the Vesting of an Award that the Participant to whom the Award was issued (the ""Relevant Participant"") shall be subject to Malus and may therefore decide to:(i) reduce the number of Shares to which an Award relates;(ii) cancel an Award;(iii) impose further conditions on an Award; or(iv) delay the Vesting of the Award if the action or conduct of the Participant  Group Member or relevant business unit is under investigation by the Company  or the Company has been notified by a regulatory authority that an investigation into such action or conduct has been commenced so that the delivery of the Shares in respect of such Award will be delayed until any action or investigation is completed.(b) The circumstances in Rule 8.1(a) include  but are not limited to:(i) where there is a material restatement of the financial statements of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of the financial years ending after the grant of such Award. The Remuneration Committee will in its sole discretion determine what constitutes a material restatement; or(ii) the financial statements of the Company used in assessing the number of Shares over which the Award was granted were misstated  or that any other information relied on in making such assessment proves to have been incorrect and  in any case  the Award was granted in respect of a greater number of Shares than would have been the case had there not been such a misstatement or reliance on incorrect information or had such error not been made or had such event not occurred; or(iii) the Remuneration Committee forms the view that in assessing the extent to which any Performance Condition and/or any other condition imposed on the Award was satisfied such assessment was based on an error  or on inaccurate or misleading information or assumptions and that such error  information or assumptions resulted or would result either directly or indirectly in that Award Vesting to a greater degree than would have been the case had that error not been made;(iv) some or all of the Performance Conditions  which were deemed to have been satisfied in respect of the Award have only been satisfied as a consequence of any direct or indirect manipulation on the part of the Relevant Participant. For the purpose of this Rule  ""manipulation"" means anything done  without the knowledge of the Remuneration Committee  for the Relevant Participant's own personal gain which is unreasonable and not done for the benefit of the Company; or(v) the Relevant Participant is guilty of serious misconduct  gross negligence or fraud; or(vi) the Group or part of the Group (in respect of which the Relevant Participant has performed any functions or oversight role)  in the reasonable opinion of the Remuneration Committee  following consultation with the risk committee of the Board  if applicable  suffered a material failure of risk management; or(vii) any Group Member or a relevant business unit. (in respect of which the Relevant Participant has performed any functions or oversight role)  in the reasonable opinion of the Remuneration Committee suffered a material corporate failure; or(viii) the censure of the Company  any Group Member or a relevant business unit by a regulatory authority or events having a significant detrimental impact (as reasonably determined by the Remuneration Committee) on the reputation of the Company  any Group Member or a relevant business unit  where the Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the Relevant Participant was responsible for the censure or reputational damage and that the censure or reputational damage is attributable to them; or(ix) the Group or part of the Group (in respect of which the Relevant Participant has performed any functions or oversight role) receives notification in writing that it may become subject to any regulatory sanctions  where the Remuneration Committee forms the view that the conduct of the Relevant Participant contributed to the circumstances leading to such notification.8.2 Clawback(a) Notwithstanding any other rule of the Plan  the Remuneration Committee may decide at any time up to the second anniversary of the Vesting of an Award  that the Relevant Participant shall be subject to Clawback if:(i) there is a material restatement of the financial statements of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of the financial years ending after the grant of such Award. The Remuneration Committee will in its sole discretion determine what constitutes a material restatement; or(ii) the financial statements of the Company used in assessing the number of Shares over which the Award was granted were misstated  or that any other information relied on in making such assessment proves to have been incorrect and  in any case  the Award was granted in respect of a greater number of Shares than would have been the case had there not been such a misstatement or reliance on incorrect information or had such error not been made or had such event not occurred; or(iii) the Remuneration Committee forms the view that  in assessing the extent to which any Performance Condition and/or any other condition imposed on the Award was satisfied  such assessment was based on an error  or on inaccurate or misleading information or assumptions and that such error  information or assumptions resulted either directly or indirectly in that Award Vesting to a greater degree than would have been the case had that error not been made; or(iv) some or all of the Performance Conditions  which were deemed to have been satisfied in respect of the Award have only been satisfied as a consequence of any direct or indirect manipulation on the part of the Relevant Participant.

(in respect of which the Relevant Participant has performed any functions or oversight role)  in the reasonable opinion of the Remuneration Committee suffered a material corporate failure; or(vii) the Relevant Participant is found guilty of or pleads guilty to a crime that is related to or damages the business or reputation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; or(viii) the Relevant Participant is guilty of serious misconduct or gross negligence  which causes loss or reputational damage to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; or(ix) the censure of the Company  any Group Member or a relevant business unit by a regulatory authority or events having a significant detrimental impact (as reasonably determined by the Remuneration Committee) on the reputation of the Company  any Group Member or a relevant business unit  where the Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the Relevant Participant was responsible for the censure or reputational damage and that the censure or reputational damage is attributable to them; or(x) the Group or part of the Group (in respect of which the Relevant Participant has performed any functions or oversight role) receives notification in writing that it may become subject to any regulatory sanctions  where the Remuneration Committee forms the view that the conduct of the Relevant Participant contributed to the circumstances leading to such notification; or(xi) the Relevant Participant is in breach of any applicable restrictions on competition  solicitation or the use of confidential information (whether arising out of the Relevant Participant's employment contract  his termination arrangements or any internal policies).(b) Where the Remuneration Committee decides that an Award is subject to Clawback:(i) the Remuneration Committee may require the Relevant Participant to forfeit the right to all or part of the Shares which would  but for the operation of this Rule 8  be transferable to the Relevant Participant in respect of such Award; and/or(ii) the Remuneration Committee may reduce (including  if appropriate  reducing to zero):(A) the amount of the next bonus (if any) which would  but for the operation of Rule 8.2 be payable to the Relevant Participant under any bonus plan operated by any Group Member;

and/or(C) the extent to which any rights to acquire Shares (including annual incentive deferred into Shares) granted to the Relevant Participant under any share incentive plan (other than the Plan) operated by the Company vest or become exercisable notwithstanding the extent to which any conditions imposed on such rights to acquire Shares have been satisfied;

Taxation9.1 A Participant will be responsible for and shall indemnify each relevant Group Member and the Trustee against any Tax Liability relating to his Award. For the purpose of this Rule a Group Member includes a company that was and is no longer a Group Member. Any Group Member and/or the Trustee may withhold an amount equal to such Tax Liability from any amounts due to the Participant (to the extent such withholding is lawful) and/or make any other arrangements (including a loan) as it considers appropriate to ensure recovery of such Tax Liability including  without limitation  the sale of sufficient Shares acquired subject to the Award to realise an amount equal to the Tax Liability.9.2 Where  in relation to an Award  the Remuneration Committee  the Trustee  the Company or any Group Member (as the case may be) is liable  or is in accordance with current practice believed by the Remuneration Committee  the Trustee or the Company to be liable  to account to any revenue or other authority for any sum in respect of any tax or social security liability of the Participant  neither the Trustee nor the Company  as appropriate  shall be under any obligation to acquire Shares for the benefit of the Participant or transfer or issue Shares  as appropriate  to the Participant unless the Participant  as the case may be  has paid to the Trustee  the Company or the Group Member (as the case may be) an amount sufficient to discharge the liability.9.3 In addition  the Trustee shall have the discretion to retain sufficient of the Shares the subject of any Award to ensure that any liability to taxation or otherwise of the Participant or the Company or the Trustee in respect of the receipt by any such holder of such Shares is capable of discharge.10. Cash Equivalent10.1 Subject to Rule 10.2  at any time prior to the date on which a Conditional Award has Vested or  in the case of a Nil-Cost Option  has been exercised  the Remuneration Committee may determine that in substitution for a Participant's right to acquire some or all of the Shares to which his Award relates or in substitution of Dividend Shares receivable under Rule 6  the Participant will instead receive a cash sum (the ""Cash Equivalent""). The Cash Equivalent will be equal to the Market Value of that number of the Shares which would otherwise have been transferred and for these purposes:(a) in the case of a Conditional Award  Market Value will be determined on the date of Vesting;(b) in the case of a Nil-Cost Option  Market Value will be determined on the date of exercise; and(c) in either case  the Cash Equivalent will be paid to the Participant as soon as practicable after the Vesting of the Conditional Award or the exercise of the Nil-Cost Option  net of any deductions (including but not limited to any Tax Liability or similar liabilities) as may be required by law.10.2 The Remuneration Committee may determine that this Rule 10 will not apply to an Award or any part of it.10.3 In circumstances determined by the Remuneration Committee  in its absolute discretion  a request may be made to the Trustee to satisfy the obligation to deliver Shares on Award Vesting or Nil-Cost Option exercise (to the relevant Participant other than an executive director of the Company) by the payment to the such Participant  as the case may be  of a cash payment equal to the Cash Equivalent of the Shares the subject of such Award.11. Vesting in Special Circumstances11.1 Notwithstanding Rule 7.4  if an Award Holder dies before the Vesting or exercise of his Awards:(a) all of the Shares which are the subject of any Award which is not subject to Performance Conditions shall Vest as soon as can be reasonably arranged by the Company following the Participant's death  or shall be capable of being exercised by his personal representative within twelve months following his death;(b) any Award which is subject to Performance Conditions may Vest as provided in Rule 11.3 or except as the Remuneration Committee shall otherwise determine.(c) Any Nil-Cost Option shall lapse unless exercised by his personal representative within 12 months of the death of the Participant or if shorter  until the expiry of the Exercise Period.11.2 Notwithstanding Rule 7.4  if a Participant ceases to be employed by a Group Member before the whole or any part of his Award Vests  by reason of:(a) ill health  injury or disability evidenced to the satisfaction of the Company;(b) redundancy (within the meaning of the Redundancy Payments Acts 1967 to 2012 or any overseas equivalent) if the Company so decides;(c) retirement with the agreement of the Company;(d) his office or employment being with either a company which ceases to be a Group Member or relating to a business or part of a business which is transferred to a person who is not a Group Member; or(e) for any other reason  if the Remuneration Committee so decideshis Award shall lapse except to the extent it is already Vested or it Vests as provided in Rule 11.3 or except as the Remuneration Committee shall otherwise determine.11.3 All of the Shares which are the subject of a Buy-out Award shall Vest in full unless the Remuneration Committee otherwise determines. The number of Shares in respect of which the Award Vests pursuant to Rule 11.1(b) or 11.2 will be determined by the Remuneration Committee and the Remuneration Committee may  in its absolute discretion  determine that the level of Vesting shall be less than 100% in order to take into account:(a) the extent to which any Performance Condition  if applicable  has not been satisfied at the date of cessation of office or employment; and/or(b) the period of time that has elapsed from:(i) in the case of an Award that is not a Consolidated Award  the Award Date to the date of cessation of office or employment; or(ii) in the case of a Consolidated Award:(A) in respect of that part of the Award that relates to the first Performance Period  the Award Date to the date of cessation of office or employment; and(B) in respect of each part of the Award that relates to a subsequent Performance Period  the anniversary of the Award Date immediately following the commencement of that Performance Period to the date of cessation of office or employment in each case compared to the period from the Award Date (or in the case of a Consolidated Award  the Award Date or the anniversary of the Award Date  as applicable) to the applicable Normal Vesting Date to a maximum of three years unless otherwise specified and to the extent that the Award does not Vest in full  the remainder will lapse immediately.
