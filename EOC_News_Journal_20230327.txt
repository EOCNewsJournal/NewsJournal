21385,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://www.moneysense.ca/columns/ask-a-planner/for-canadians-living-abroad-is-it-worth-investing-in-foreign-etfs/,For Canadians living abroad  is it worth investing in foreign ETFs?,Canadians with extra savings overseas may wish to invest in foreign ETFs. However  there may be alternatives with less complex tax implications.,The exchange-traded fund (ETF) you are thinking about buying—VWCE—is the Vanguard FTSE All-World UCITS ETF. It trades in Euros on three stock exchanges: the NYSE Euronext  the Deutsche Börse and the Borsa Italiana S.p.A. You can likely buy it through most European discount brokerage accounts.Although it trades in Euros  the base currency for the ETF is actually U.S. dollars. The fund seeks to track the performance of the FTSE All-World Index—about 4 000 large and mid-sized stocks in developed and emerging markets. Roughly 60% of the ETF is allocated to U.S. stocks and the other 40% is non-U.S. stocks.It bears mentioning  Nick  that Vanguard offers similar ETFs in Canada and the U.S. that may be easier for a Canadian investor to purchase through a Canadian brokerage account. Vanguard FTSE Global All Cap ex Canada Index ETF (VXC) trades on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) and Vanguard Total World Stock ETF (VT) trades on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). They track a similar mix of international stocks. I use these ETFs as examples of widely held  large ETF alternatives from Vanguard in North America  but if you do some digging  you may be able to find an ETF that’s even more similar to VWCE.Does the currency you buy a foreign investment in matter?Unless currency hedging is employed  the currency you buy an international ETF in does not really matter. If an ETF owns Samsung shares  for example  and those shares rise in value in South Korean won  their value also rises in Euros  U.S. dollars and Canadian dollars.When you buy an ETF in a foreign currency or country  there will typically be withholding tax on the dividend income. The rate is generally between 15% and 25%. When you buy an ETF in a taxable non-registered account  the income is taxable in Canada. A Canadian taxpayer can generally claim a foreign tax credit for any tax already withheld to reduce their Canadian tax payable. So  you can avoid double taxation.How to handle your tax returnBuying foreign investments in a taxable investment account may result in more complexity when you file your tax return  Nick. The foreign country’s tax reporting may not be set up to report income and capital gains easily on your Canadian tax return  so you may need to calculate them manually. You need to convert the income into Canadian dollars. If you sell a taxable investment in a foreign currency  you need to calculate the purchase price and the sale price in Canadian dollars based on the foreign exchange rates at the time of purchase and sale.If your taxable foreign investments have a cumulative cost base in excess of $100 000 Canadian  you may need to file form T1135 Foreign Income Verification Statement. This form should be completed and submitted as part of your annual income tax filing. Failure to do so can result in penalties.It might be simpler to buy the Vanguard FTSE Global All Cap ex Canada Index ETF (VXC) or a similar Canadian-listed ETF. The annual income and capital gains would be reported on T3 and T5008 slips in Canadian dollars  making it easier to report on your tax return. You would avoid the T1135 filing requirement. And you would own a similar investment to the VWCE ETF you are considering.,neutral,0.04,0.95,0.01,mixed,0.56,0.18,0.26,True,English,"['foreign ETFs', 'Canadians', 'most European discount brokerage accounts', 'Borsa Italiana S.p.A.', 'Vanguard FTSE Global All Cap', 'Vanguard Total World Stock ETF', 'T1135 Foreign Income Verification Statement', 'Vanguard FTSE All-World UCITS ETF', 'New York Stock Exchange', 'FTSE All-World Index', 'annual income tax filing', 'T1135 filing requirement', 'Toronto Stock Exchange', 'three stock exchanges', 'Canadian brokerage account', 'Deutsche Börse', 'foreign exchange rates', 'taxable non-registered account', 'cumulative cost base', 'taxable investment account', 'foreign tax credit', 'U.S. dollars', 'taxable foreign investments', 'U.S. stocks', 'similar Canadian-listed ETF', 'Canada Index ETF', 'large ETF alternatives', 'Canadian tax return', 'similar investment', 'Canadian dollars', 'foreign currency', 'withholding tax', 'tax reporting', 'similar mix', 'international ETF', 'base currency', 'foreign country', 'Canadian investor', 'Canadian taxpayer', 'mid-sized stocks', 'emerging markets', 'international stocks', 'North America', 'South Korean', 'double taxation', 'capital gains', 'T5008 slips', 'similar ETFs', 'currency hedging', 'VWCE ETF', 'exchange-traded fund', 'NYSE Euronext', 'Samsung shares', 'purchase price', 'sale price', '$100,000 Canadian', '4,000 large', 'Euros', 'performance', 'developed', 'Nick', 'VXC', 'TSX', 'VT', 'examples', 'digging', 'matter', 'value', 'complexity', 'time', 'excess', 'part', 'Failure', 'penalties', 'T3']",2023-03-27,2023-03-27,moneysense.ca

French and German regulatory authorities for drugs and medical products  ANSM (Agence Nationale de Sécurité du Médicament et des Produits de Santé) and BfArM (Bundesinstitut für Arnzeimittel und Medizinprodukte) respectively  have authorized the application regarding the launch of the Company's randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase 2b clinical trial evaluating MaaT033 in improving survival of patients with hematological malignancies receiving allo-HSCT. The Company also received authorization from ANSM  the French regulatory agency  to initiate its Phase 1b pilot study evaluating MaaT033 in slowing down disease progression in ALS. The Company will communicate on inclusion of the first patient in each study  which is expected by mid-2023.""With the full regulatory authorizations received for conducting both trials in these two significant European markets  we can proceed with the final steps toward enrolling the first patients in each study "" states Hervé Affagard  CEO and co-founder of MaaT Pharma. ""The authorizations are an important milestone in our overall strategy to demonstrate the potential of MaaT033 in restoring gut microbiota dysbiosis.""Phase 2b clinical trial (""PHOEBUS"") evaluating MaaT033 in hemato-oncologyAs previously announced  the randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase 2b clinical trial  called PHOEBUS  will enroll 387 patients  and could include up to 56 sites in Europe. The primary endpoint of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of MaaT033 in improving overall survival at 12 months.

21390,EuroNext,Bing API,https://www.moneysense.ca/columns/ask-a-planner/for-canadians-living-abroad-is-it-worth-investing-in-foreign-etfs/,For Canadians living abroad  is it worth investing in foreign ETFs?,Canadians with extra savings overseas may wish to invest in foreign ETFs. However  there may be alternatives with less complex tax implications.,The exchange-traded fund (ETF) you are thinking about buying—VWCE—is the Vanguard FTSE All-World UCITS ETF. It trades in Euros on three stock exchanges: the NYSE Euronext  the Deutsche Börse and the Borsa Italiana S.p.A. You can likely buy it through most European discount brokerage accounts.Although it trades in Euros  the base currency for the ETF is actually U.S. dollars. The fund seeks to track the performance of the FTSE All-World Index—about 4 000 large and mid-sized stocks in developed and emerging markets. Roughly 60% of the ETF is allocated to U.S. stocks and the other 40% is non-U.S. stocks.It bears mentioning  Nick  that Vanguard offers similar ETFs in Canada and the U.S. that may be easier for a Canadian investor to purchase through a Canadian brokerage account. Vanguard FTSE Global All Cap ex Canada Index ETF (VXC) trades on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) and Vanguard Total World Stock ETF (VT) trades on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). They track a similar mix of international stocks. I use these ETFs as examples of widely held  large ETF alternatives from Vanguard in North America  but if you do some digging  you may be able to find an ETF that’s even more similar to VWCE.Does the currency you buy a foreign investment in matter?Unless currency hedging is employed  the currency you buy an international ETF in does not really matter. If an ETF owns Samsung shares  for example  and those shares rise in value in South Korean won  their value also rises in Euros  U.S. dollars and Canadian dollars.When you buy an ETF in a foreign currency or country  there will typically be withholding tax on the dividend income. The rate is generally between 15% and 25%. When you buy an ETF in a taxable non-registered account  the income is taxable in Canada. A Canadian taxpayer can generally claim a foreign tax credit for any tax already withheld to reduce their Canadian tax payable. So  you can avoid double taxation.How to handle your tax returnBuying foreign investments in a taxable investment account may result in more complexity when you file your tax return  Nick. The foreign country’s tax reporting may not be set up to report income and capital gains easily on your Canadian tax return  so you may need to calculate them manually. You need to convert the income into Canadian dollars. If you sell a taxable investment in a foreign currency  you need to calculate the purchase price and the sale price in Canadian dollars based on the foreign exchange rates at the time of purchase and sale.If your taxable foreign investments have a cumulative cost base in excess of $100 000 Canadian  you may need to file form T1135 Foreign Income Verification Statement. This form should be completed and submitted as part of your annual income tax filing. Failure to do so can result in penalties.It might be simpler to buy the Vanguard FTSE Global All Cap ex Canada Index ETF (VXC) or a similar Canadian-listed ETF. The annual income and capital gains would be reported on T3 and T5008 slips in Canadian dollars  making it easier to report on your tax return. You would avoid the T1135 filing requirement. And you would own a similar investment to the VWCE ETF you are considering.,neutral,0.04,0.95,0.01,mixed,0.56,0.18,0.26,True,English,"['foreign ETFs', 'Canadians', 'most European discount brokerage accounts', 'Borsa Italiana S.p.A.', 'Vanguard FTSE Global All Cap', 'Vanguard Total World Stock ETF', 'T1135 Foreign Income Verification Statement', 'Vanguard FTSE All-World UCITS ETF', 'New York Stock Exchange', 'FTSE All-World Index', 'annual income tax filing', 'T1135 filing requirement', 'Toronto Stock Exchange', 'three stock exchanges', 'Canadian brokerage account', 'Deutsche Börse', 'foreign exchange rates', 'taxable non-registered account', 'cumulative cost base', 'taxable investment account', 'foreign tax credit', 'U.S. dollars', 'taxable foreign investments', 'U.S. stocks', 'similar Canadian-listed ETF', 'Canada Index ETF', 'large ETF alternatives', 'Canadian tax return', 'similar investment', 'Canadian dollars', 'foreign currency', 'withholding tax', 'tax reporting', 'similar mix', 'international ETF', 'base currency', 'foreign country', 'Canadian investor', 'Canadian taxpayer', 'mid-sized stocks', 'emerging markets', 'international stocks', 'North America', 'South Korean', 'double taxation', 'capital gains', 'T5008 slips', 'similar ETFs', 'currency hedging', 'VWCE ETF', 'exchange-traded fund', 'NYSE Euronext', 'Samsung shares', 'purchase price', 'sale price', '$100,000 Canadian', '4,000 large', 'Euros', 'performance', 'developed', 'Nick', 'VXC', 'TSX', 'VT', 'examples', 'digging', 'matter', 'value', 'complexity', 'time', 'excess', 'part', 'Failure', 'penalties', 'T3']",2023-03-27,2023-03-27,moneysense.ca
