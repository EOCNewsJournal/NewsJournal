The complete terms and conditions for the warrants are set out in ""Terms of the BioInvent International AB warrants 2023/2025"".The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential right is that the issue forms part of the implementation of Option Program 2023/2025. In view of what is set forth under Background and motive in the complete proposal on Option Program 2023/2025  the Board of Directors is of the opinion that it is of benefit to BioInvent and its shareholders that all employees and other key persons are offered to participate in Option Program 2023/2025.The Board of Directors further proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to approve that BioInvent Finans AB transfers warrants to participants in Option Program 2023/2025 and otherwise disposes of the warrants in order to secure the company's commitments and costs in connection with Option Program 2023/2025.COSTS FOR OPTION PROGRAM 2023/2025The Option Program 2023/2025 will lead to certain costs. Based on the assumption that 100 per cent of the options in the program will be vested  the salary cost in the accounts pursuant to IFRS 2 is expected to amount to approximately SEK 4.8 million in total during the period 2023-2025 based on the options actual value at the start of the program. The options have no market value as they are non-transferable. However  the Board of Directors has assessed a theoretical value of the options through application of the Black & Scholes valuation model (in relation to the performance criteria). The calculations have been based on an assumed share price of SEK 27.00 and an assumed volatility of 37 per cent. The value of the options of Option Program 2023/2025 pursuant to this valuation is approximately SEK 5.86 per option with the application of the Black & Scholes formula. The transfer restrictions have not been taken into account in the valuation. The actual IFRS 2 cost during the vesting period depends on how many options that are vested.At fulfilment of the vesting conditions and exercise of the options  Option Program 2023/2025 will lead to costs in the form of social security charges. The total costs for social security charges during the vesting period depends on how many options that are vested and the value of the options at exercise. Based on the assumption that 100 per cent of the options in the Option Program 2023/2025 will be vested  an assumed Subscription Price of SEK 33.75 and an assumed share price of SEK 108 at the exercise of the options  the costs for social security charges will amount to approximately SEK 9.7 million. The company's total cost for social security charges is proposed to be hedged through a directed issue of warrants pursuant to item B above.DILUTION AND EFFECTS ON KEY FIGURESOption Program 2023/2025 comprises the issuance of maximum 948 300 warrants  of which 817 500 warrants to secure BioInvent's commitments towards the participants in the program and 130 800 warrants to secure costs for social security charges. At full exercise of all issued warrants under Option Program 2023/2025 for subscription of new shares  BioInvent's share capital will increase by SEK 189 660. This corresponds to approximately 1.40 per cent of the shares and votes in the company after exercise. The warrants of Option Program 2023/2025 would have affected the key figure earnings after tax per share (2022) by SEK -0.07. To further illustrate the potential dilution that Option Program 2023/2025 may be expected to entail  the size of the program has also been calculated based on the assumption of an annual staff turnover of 10 per cent and an assumption that the performance criteria are met to 90 per cent  which would entail a dilution of approximately 0.88 per cent.In the Board of Director's assessment  the similar long-term incentive program resolved by the Annual General Meeting 2022 have so far fulfilled its purpose  and following evaluation of the effectiveness of the Option Program 2023/2025  the intention of the Board of Directors is to propose recurring option plans on an annual basis  similar to the Option Program 2023/2025.BioInvent has one ongoing equity incentive program for management referred to as Option Program 2019/2025 (stock options)  which comprises maximum 150 616 new shares in BioInvent  assuming full vesting 2022  at a subscription price of SEK 77.25 per share. If all options are exercised for new shares  the company's share capital will increase by SEK 30 124  which is equivalent to approximately 0.23 per cent of the shares and votes in the company after exercise.BioInvent has one ongoing equity incentive program for all employees referred to as Option Program 2022/2024 (stock options)  which comprises maximum 714 628 new shares in BioInvent  assuming full vesting 2024  at a subscription price of SEK 56.21 per share. If all options are exercised for new shares  the company's share capital will increase by SEK 142 926  which is equivalent to approximately 1.07 per cent of the shares and votes in the company after exercise.MAJORITY REQUIREMENTSThe Board of Directors' proposal for a resolution regarding Option Program 2023/2025 and the necessary security measures connected thereto pursuant to items A and B above form one combined proposal. Therefore  it is proposed that the resolutions of the Annual General Meeting under item A and B are passed as one single resolution  pursuant to the majority provisions of chapter 16 of the Swedish Companies Act  meaning that shareholders holding not less than 9/10th of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the general meeting must vote for the proposal.Resolution on authorization of the Board of Directors to resolve on new shares issue (item 16)The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorize the Board of Directors to resolve on the issue of new shares on one or several occasions during the period up to the next Annual General Meeting. The number of shares to be issued by virtue of the authorization shall not entail a dilution effect of more than 20 per cent of the registered share capital after completed issue. The issue may take place with or without a deviation from the shareholders' preferential right and with or without provisions on contribution in kind or set-off or any other terms. The purpose of the authorization is to increase the company's financial flexibility and enable acquisitions by payment of shares. If the Board of Directors resolves on an issue with deviation from the shareholders' preferential right  the reason may be to add new capital and/or new company owners of strategic importance to the company and/or the acquisition of other companies or businesses. At a deviation from the shareholders' preferential right  the subscription price shall be determined in accordance with market conditions. Other terms may be resolved by the Board of Directors.The proposal is subject to support by shareholders representing at least two-thirds of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the meeting.C. RIGHT TO REQUEST INFORMATIONThe Board of Directors and the Managing Director shall  if any shareholder so requests  and if the Board of Directors considers that this can be done without significant harm for the company  give information on circumstances that can affect the judgement of an item on the agenda  circumstances that can affect the assessment of the company's or its subsidiaries' financial situation and the company's relation to other companies within the Group and the group accounts.D.

The Remuneration report is available on the company’s website  www.bilia.com.Item 16 - Authorisation for the Board of Directors to decide on acquisition and transfer of own sharesThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorise the Board to make decisions regarding the acquisition and transfer of own shares. The purpose of the authorisation is to give the Board greater freedom in its work with the company’s capital structure and to make it possible  if deemed appropriate  to acquire enterprises using the company’s shares as payment or to increase liquidity in the company’s share. The Board of Directors considers that company shares can  from the viewpoint of the shareholders  be an appropriate means of payment (full or partial) in conjunction with business combinations  whereby the preferential rights of the shareholders must for obvious reasons be waived. The Board’s proposal entails the following:Acquisition: The Board of Directors may  on one or more occasions up till the Annual General Meeting 2024  decide to acquire a number of Bilia shares such that the company’s own holding does not exceed 1/10th of the number of shares in the company at any given time. The consideration paid for the shares shall be on market terms and buy-back shall be possible by cash purchase on Nasdaq Stockholm at a price within the range noted at that particular time and otherwise subject to existing regulations.Transfer: On one or more occasions prior to the Annual General Meeting 2024   the Board shall be able to decide on the transfer of all or part of the own shares that the Company holds at any given time. Transfer shall be possible by deviation from the shareholders’ preferential right at a price equal to the current share price  or equal to an average of the current share price for a maximum of 10 trading days in connection with the transfer  and with a deviation of no more than 10 per cent. The shares may be transferred on Nasdaq Stockholm  or the shares may be used as a means of payment in connection with a company acquisition.A valid decision requires that the proposal be approved by shareholders holding more than two-thirds (2/3) of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the meeting.Item 17a - Determination on long-term incentive programThe board proposes that the AGM decides to adopt a long-term incentive program in the form of a share savings program for senior executives and other key personnel within the Bilia Group (the ""Program""). The decision according to this item 17 (a) shall be conditional on the AGM deciding on hedging measures due to the Program  either in accordance with the proposal under item 17 (b) below or in accordance with the proposal under item 17 (c) below.The purpose of the Program is to create the conditions to motivate and retain competent key personnel in the Bilia Group  to attract new employees and to increase motivation to reach and exceed Bilia's financial goals and sustainability goals. The Program has been designed based on the fact that it is desirable for senior executives and other key persons within the Bilia Group to be shareholders in Bilia. Participation in the Program requires that the participant has contributed with private investment. The Program also rewards employees' continued loyalty and thereby the long-term value growth in Bilia. Against this background  the board believes that adoption of the Program will have a positive effect on the Bilia Group's future development and will consequently be beneficial for both Bilia and its shareholders.The program is proposed to include a total of approximately sixty (60) key people in the Bilia Group (""Participants"") roughly distributed as follows:45 Participants in Sweden 14 Participants in Norway  and3 Participants in total in Luxembourg and Belgium.The Participants in the Program must have invested by acquiring shares in Bilia AB (publ) (“Savings Shares”). Subsequently  the Participants will be given an opportunity to acquire  free of cost  shares within the framework of the Program  so-called ”Performance Shares”  under the terms stipulated below (the ”Rights”).In order to be able to participate in the Program  the Participant must have contributed with a private investment through the acquisition of Savings Shares. The Savings Shares will be acquired by Aktieinvest at market price on behalf of the participants  during part or all of the acquisition period that runs between 27 April 2023 and on 16 May 2023  for the purpose of being allocated to the Program.A Participant may invest in Bilia shares up to the maximum number of shares in each category plus any over-allotment. Participants can apply for a maximum of 50% over-allocation if the Program does not receive full participation  in which case allocation takes place pro rata. The maximum number of Savings Shares that can be allocated to the Program for the two participant categories is shown below.Category 1Group management (9 people) - Maximum 1 750 Savings SharesCategory 2- subgroup A (circa 13 people) - Maximum 1 000 Savings Shares- subgroup B (circa 20 people) - Maximum 750 Savings Shares- subgroup C (circa 20 people) – Maximum 500 Savings SharesThe minimum number of Savings Shares that a Participant must acquire in order to participate in the Program must correspond to a market value of at least twenty-five thousand (SEK 25 000) SEK. For each Savings Share held within the framework of the Program  Bilia will award the Participant a total of 4.5 Rights  which means that the Participant  provided that the performance targets are fully met  will be awarded 4.5 Performance Shares.General termsAwarding of Performance Shares takes place on the condition that the Participant from the start of the Program up to and including the date of publication of the interim report for January-March 2026 (""Vesting Period"") has retained his original Savings Shares and that the Participant  with certain exceptions  is still employed within the Bilia Group. The Program must start as soon as practically possible after the AGM has adopted the board's proposal in this regard.Free allocation of Performance Shares is  apart from what is stated in the point above  conditional on the achievement of the performance targets established by the board. The allocation per Participant is the same for all Participants. The maximum number of Performance Shares allocated within the framework of the Program amounts to 242 000. For the maximum allocation of Performance Shares  it is required that targets established by the board regarding total return on Bilia's shares and increased profit per share be met  and that the targets for customer satisfaction and gender equality be met. Allocation of Performance Shares per Savings Share can take place as follows:- one (1) performance share is awarded if the total return on Bilia's shares has been positive during the duration of the Program. The calculation of the total return shall be based on the Bilia share's average closing price during the trading days in March 2023  which shall be compared with the Bilia share's average closing price during the trading days in March 2026  adjusted for dividends paid during the Program's term.- one (1) Performance Share is awarded to the Participant if the profit per share in 2025 has increased by 10 per cent compared to the profit per share in 2022.- one (1) Performance Share is awarded to the Participant if the profit per share in 2025 has increased by 20 per cent compared to the profit per share in 2022.- one (1) Performance Share is awarded to the Participant if Bilia's average customer satisfaction during the period exceeds the benchmark (competitors' customer satisfaction per car brand) by 2 percentage points. Customer satisfaction is based on the operations that existed as of 31 December 2022 (excluding terminated operations).- one-half (0.5) Performance Share is awarded if the percentage of women in sales operations is 22% or higher in 2025 (acquisition-adjusted).Terms for the RightsThe following terms shall apply for the Rights under the Program  in addition to what is stated above:The Participant must acquire the Savings Shares no later than 16 May 2023  or at a later date if the board postpones the acquisition period.The rights must be earned during the Vesting Period. Rights cannot be transferred or pledged.4.5 Rights entitles the Participant the right to receive 4.5 Performance Shares free of charge  after the end of the Vesting Period  provided that the Participant has  with certain exceptions  been employed by Bilia during the Vesting Period and has retained his Savings Shares.If the Board of Directors determines that the terms for allotment of Performance Shares are no longer reasonable in the light of  for example  major changes in Bilia  Bilia Group or the market  the Board is entitled to make adjustments of the Program.The Board is entitled to adopt more detailed terms for the Program.The Program shall consist of no more than 240 000 shares (excluding 68 000 shares required to guarantee social security contributions for the Program as explained below) based on the assumption of full investment. It is assumed that 68 000 shares will be sold on the market to cover the costs of social security contributions.The number of Performance Shares shall be recalculated in the event that a bonus issue (with the issue of new shares)  a stock split or reverse stock split  a rights issue or other similar events occur in Bilia during the Vesting Period.Allotment of Performance Shares under the ProgramIn order to implement the Program in a cost-effective and flexible manner  the Board of Directors has considered different methods for securing delivery of Performance Shares under the Program. The Board has thereby found that the most cost-effective alternative is to guarantee delivery by transfer of own shares held by Bilia. The Board of Directors therefore proposes that the AGM resolve as the main alternative  in accordance with item 17 (b) below  to transfer own shares.In the event a majority cannot be achieved for item 17 (b) below  the Board of Directors proposes that it be resolved that Bilia may enter into an equity swap agreement with a third party in accordance with item 17 (c) below.Costs for the ProgramCosts for the Program are calculated in accordance with IFRS 2 and recognised in the income statement. The cost is recognised on a straight-line basis over the Vesting Period.Based on the assumptions that the Program is fully subscribed  that all Participants invest the maximum number of Savings Shares  that the share price amounts to SEK 132.50 at the time of investment  assuming an annual staff turnover of 10% in the participant group and that the remaining Participants still own all Savings Shares at the end of the Vesting Period  that the profit per share in 2025 has increased by 10% (but not 20%) compared to the profit per share in 2022  and that the performance targets are otherwise fully achieved  implies an IFRS 2 cost for the Program of approximately SEK 14.0 million. If all performance targets are achieved  the IFRS 2 cost for the Program will equal approximately SEK 18.2 million.Social security contributions must also be paid and can be estimated to amount to a weighted nominal percentage of 28 per cent. The Participants reside in  and are tax residents of  Sweden  Norway  Luxembourg and Belgium. With an assumed distribution of shares between these countries  and with other conditions as stipulated above  the annual social security contributions are estimated to amount to SEK 6 8 million and SEK 8 7 million if all performance targets are achieved.Effect of Program on important key ratios and share dilutionThe Program is estimated to comprise a total of no more than 242 000 shares  excluding measures to guarantee social security contributions  which is equivalent to about 0.25 per cent of Bilia’s total number of shares outstanding.Outstanding rights to shares under previous long-term incentive program amount to about 0.1 per cent of Bilia’s total number of shares outstanding. The effect of existing incentive program  including the Program  on important key ratios is only marginal. For a description of Bilia’s other long-term incentive programs  see the company’s Annual Report for 2022 and the company’s website  www.bilia.com.Drafting processThe Board’s decision to propose that the AGM resolve to approve the Program as described above was made at a Board meeting of 21 March 2023. The proposal was drafted by the Board’s Compensation Committee in consultation with the Board and with the support of external advisers.Item 17b - Proposal for decision regarding transfer of own shares to Participants in the ProgramThe Board of Directors proposes that  in order to guarantee delivery of Performance Shares  the AGM resolve that a maximum of 242 000 shares previously acquired and now held by Bilia can be transferred to Participants within the framework of the Program.The number of shares that can be transferred is subject to recalculation due to a intervening bonus issue  stock split  rights issue and/or similar events.Item 17c - Equity swap agreement with third partyIn the event the necessary majority cannot be achieved for item 17 (b) above  the Board of Directors proposes that the AGM resolve to guarantee the expected financial exposure due to the Program by allowing Bilia to enter into an equity swap agreement on market terms with a third party  whereby the third party can  in its own name  acquire and transfer Bilia shares to the Participants.Item 17d - Proposed resolution to authorise the Board of Directors to approve transfer to cover social security contributions for the ProgramIn order to cover social security contributions that arise in conjunction with transfers of shares to the Participants under the Program  the Board of Directors proposes that the AGM authorise the Board to approve transfers of own shares under the following terms:- Transfer shall be made on Nasdaq Stockholm (the ”Stock Exchange”).- Transfer can be made  on one or more occasions prior to the 2024 Annual General Meeting  of no more than 68 000  shares held by Bilia.- Transfer of shares on the Stock Exchange can only be made at a price per share that lies within the noted price range at any given time.- Transfer can only be made in exchange for cash payment.The maximum number of shares that can be transferred/acquired on the Stock Exchange may be recalculated in the event a bonus issue (with the issue of new shares)  stock split or reverse stock split occurs in Bilia  or if another event occurs that has occasioned recalculation of the number of shares to be transferred to the Participants under the Program.The Board of Directors intends to propose at future Annual General Meetings as well that the Annual General Meeting authorise the Board to approve transfer of own shares on the Stock Exchange to cover social security contributions that arise under the Program.TermsThe Board’s proposal that the AGM resolve to implement the Program is conditional on the AGM’s also deciding to adopt measures to guarantee the Program as stipulated above. The Board’s proposal that the AGM resolve to approve transfer of own shares is similarly conditional on the AGM’s decision to approve the Program and authorisation of transfer of own shares to cover social security contributions.Majority required for decisionA valid decision for item 17a above requires that the proposal be approved by shareholders holding more than one-half (1/2) of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the meeting. A valid decision for item 17b above requires that the proposal be approved by shareholders holding at least nine-tenths (9/10) of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the meeting. A valid decision for item 17c above requires that the proposal be approved by shareholders holding more than one-half (1/2) of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the meeting. A valid decision for item 17d above requires that the proposal be approved by shareholders holding more than two-thirds (2/3) of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the meeting.Processing of personal dataFor information on how your personal data is processed  please see:https://www.euroclear.com/dam/ESwithLegal/Privacy-notice-bolagsstammor-engelska.pdfFurther informationThe Annual report  auditor’s report  auditor’s statement on application of guidelines for remuneration to the Group Management  the board’s proposal for the long term incentive program and other documents to be provided prior to the AGM under the Swedish Companies Act and the Swedish Corporate Gernance Code will be available at Bilia AB at Norra Långebergsgatan 3 in Gothenburg and at www.bilia.com (menu header About us – Corporate Governance – General Meeting) not later than on 5 April 2023  and will be sent to shareholders who so request and provide their postal address.

The Board’s proposal entails the following:Acquisition: The Board of Directors may  on one or more occasions up till the Annual General Meeting 2024  decide to acquire a number of Bilia shares such that the company’s own holding does not exceed 1/10th of the number of shares in the company at any given time.

The shares may be transferred on Nasdaq Stockholm  or the shares may be used as a means of payment in connection with a company acquisition.A valid decision requires that the proposal be approved by shareholders holding more than two-thirds (2/3) of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the meeting.Item 17a - Determination on long-term incentive programThe board proposes that the AGM decides to adopt a long-term incentive program in the form of a share savings program for senior executives and other key personnel within the Bilia Group (the ""Program""). The decision according to this item 17 (a) shall be conditional on the AGM deciding on hedging measures due to the Program  either in accordance with the proposal under item 17 (b) below or in accordance with the proposal under item 17 (c) below.The purpose of the Program is to create the conditions to motivate and retain competent key personnel in the Bilia Group  to attract new employees and to increase motivation to reach and exceed Bilia's financial goals and sustainability goals. The Program has been designed based on the fact that it is desirable for senior executives and other key persons within the Bilia Group to be shareholders in Bilia. Participation in the Program requires that the participant has contributed with private investment. The Program also rewards employees' continued loyalty and thereby the long-term value growth in Bilia. Against this background  the board believes that adoption of the Program will have a positive effect on the Bilia Group's future development and will consequently be beneficial for both Bilia and its shareholders.The program is proposed to include a total of approximately sixty (60) key people in the Bilia Group (""Participants"") roughly distributed as follows:45 Participants in Sweden 14 Participants in Norway  and3 Participants in total in Luxembourg and Belgium.The Participants in the Program must have invested by acquiring shares in Bilia AB (publ) (“Savings Shares”). Subsequently  the Participants will be given an opportunity to acquire  free of cost  shares within the framework of the Program  so-called ”Performance Shares”  under the terms stipulated below (the ”Rights”).In order to be able to participate in the Program  the Participant must have contributed with a private investment through the acquisition of Savings Shares. The Savings Shares will be acquired by Aktieinvest at market price on behalf of the participants  during part or all of the acquisition period that runs between 27 April 2023 and on 16 May 2023  for the purpose of being allocated to the Program.A Participant may invest in Bilia shares up to the maximum number of shares in each category plus any over-allotment. Participants can apply for a maximum of 50% over-allocation if the Program does not receive full participation  in which case allocation takes place pro rata. The maximum number of Savings Shares that can be allocated to the Program for the two participant categories is shown below.Category 1Group management (9 people) - Maximum 1 750 Savings SharesCategory 2- subgroup A (circa 13 people) - Maximum 1 000 Savings Shares- subgroup B (circa 20 people) - Maximum 750 Savings Shares- subgroup C (circa 20 people) – Maximum 500 Savings SharesThe minimum number of Savings Shares that a Participant must acquire in order to participate in the Program must correspond to a market value of at least twenty-five thousand (SEK 25 000) SEK. For each Savings Share held within the framework of the Program  Bilia will award the Participant a total of 4.5 Rights  which means that the Participant  provided that the performance targets are fully met  will be awarded 4.5 Performance Shares.General termsAwarding of Performance Shares takes place on the condition that the Participant from the start of the Program up to and including the date of publication of the interim report for January-March 2026 (""Vesting Period"") has retained his original Savings Shares and that the Participant  with certain exceptions  is still employed within the Bilia Group. The Program must start as soon as practically possible after the AGM has adopted the board's proposal in this regard.Free allocation of Performance Shares is  apart from what is stated in the point above  conditional on the achievement of the performance targets established by the board. The allocation per Participant is the same for all Participants. The maximum number of Performance Shares allocated within the framework of the Program amounts to 242 000. For the maximum allocation of Performance Shares  it is required that targets established by the board regarding total return on Bilia's shares and increased profit per share be met  and that the targets for customer satisfaction and gender equality be met. Allocation of Performance Shares per Savings Share can take place as follows:- one (1) performance share is awarded if the total return on Bilia's shares has been positive during the duration of the Program. The calculation of the total return shall be based on the Bilia share's average closing price during the trading days in March 2023  which shall be compared with the Bilia share's average closing price during the trading days in March 2026  adjusted for dividends paid during the Program's term.- one (1) Performance Share is awarded to the Participant if the profit per share in 2025 has increased by 10 per cent compared to the profit per share in 2022.- one (1) Performance Share is awarded to the Participant if the profit per share in 2025 has increased by 20 per cent compared to the profit per share in 2022.- one (1) Performance Share is awarded to the Participant if Bilia's average customer satisfaction during the period exceeds the benchmark (competitors' customer satisfaction per car brand) by 2 percentage points. Customer satisfaction is based on the operations that existed as of 31 December 2022 (excluding terminated operations).- one-half (0.5) Performance Share is awarded if the percentage of women in sales operations is 22% or higher in 2025 (acquisition-adjusted).Terms for the RightsThe following terms shall apply for the Rights under the Program  in addition to what is stated above:The Participant must acquire the Savings Shares no later than 16 May 2023  or at a later date if the board postpones the acquisition period.The rights must be earned during the Vesting Period. Rights cannot be transferred or pledged.4.5 Rights entitles the Participant the right to receive 4.5 Performance Shares free of charge  after the end of the Vesting Period  provided that the Participant has  with certain exceptions  been employed by Bilia during the Vesting Period and has retained his Savings Shares.If the Board of Directors determines that the terms for allotment of Performance Shares are no longer reasonable in the light of  for example  major changes in Bilia  Bilia Group or the market  the Board is entitled to make adjustments of the Program.The Board is entitled to adopt more detailed terms for the Program.The Program shall consist of no more than 240 000 shares (excluding 68 000 shares required to guarantee social security contributions for the Program as explained below) based on the assumption of full investment. It is assumed that 68 000 shares will be sold on the market to cover the costs of social security contributions.The number of Performance Shares shall be recalculated in the event that a bonus issue (with the issue of new shares)  a stock split or reverse stock split  a rights issue or other similar events occur in Bilia during the Vesting Period.Allotment of Performance Shares under the ProgramIn order to implement the Program in a cost-effective and flexible manner  the Board of Directors has considered different methods for securing delivery of Performance Shares under the Program. The Board has thereby found that the most cost-effective alternative is to guarantee delivery by transfer of own shares held by Bilia. The Board of Directors therefore proposes that the AGM resolve as the main alternative  in accordance with item 17 (b) below  to transfer own shares.In the event a majority cannot be achieved for item 17 (b) below  the Board of Directors proposes that it be resolved that Bilia may enter into an equity swap agreement with a third party in accordance with item 17 (c) below.Costs for the ProgramCosts for the Program are calculated in accordance with IFRS 2 and recognised in the income statement. The cost is recognised on a straight-line basis over the Vesting Period.Based on the assumptions that the Program is fully subscribed  that all Participants invest the maximum number of Savings Shares  that the share price amounts to SEK 132.50 at the time of investment  assuming an annual staff turnover of 10% in the participant group and that the remaining Participants still own all Savings Shares at the end of the Vesting Period  that the profit per share in 2025 has increased by 10% (but not 20%) compared to the profit per share in 2022  and that the performance targets are otherwise fully achieved  implies an IFRS 2 cost for the Program of approximately SEK 14.0 million. If all performance targets are achieved  the IFRS 2 cost for the Program will equal approximately SEK 18.2 million.Social security contributions must also be paid and can be estimated to amount to a weighted nominal percentage of 28 per cent. The Participants reside in  and are tax residents of  Sweden  Norway  Luxembourg and Belgium. With an assumed distribution of shares between these countries  and with other conditions as stipulated above  the annual social security contributions are estimated to amount to SEK 6 8 million and SEK 8 7 million if all performance targets are achieved.Effect of Program on important key ratios and share dilutionThe Program is estimated to comprise a total of no more than 242 000 shares  excluding measures to guarantee social security contributions  which is equivalent to about 0.25 per cent of Bilia’s total number of shares outstanding.Outstanding rights to shares under previous long-term incentive program amount to about 0.1 per cent of Bilia’s total number of shares outstanding. The effect of existing incentive program  including the Program  on important key ratios is only marginal. For a description of Bilia’s other long-term incentive programs  see the company’s Annual Report for 2022 and the company’s website  www.bilia.com.Drafting processThe Board’s decision to propose that the AGM resolve to approve the Program as described above was made at a Board meeting of 21 March 2023. The proposal was drafted by the Board’s Compensation Committee in consultation with the Board and with the support of external advisers.Item 17b - Proposal for decision regarding transfer of own shares to Participants in the ProgramThe Board of Directors proposes that  in order to guarantee delivery of Performance Shares  the AGM resolve that a maximum of 242 000 shares previously acquired and now held by Bilia can be transferred to Participants within the framework of the Program.The number of shares that can be transferred is subject to recalculation due to a intervening bonus issue  stock split  rights issue and/or similar events.Item 17c - Equity swap agreement with third partyIn the event the necessary majority cannot be achieved for item 17 (b) above  the Board of Directors proposes that the AGM resolve to guarantee the expected financial exposure due to the Program by allowing Bilia to enter into an equity swap agreement on market terms with a third party  whereby the third party can  in its own name  acquire and transfer Bilia shares to the Participants.Item 17d - Proposed resolution to authorise the Board of Directors to approve transfer to cover social security contributions for the ProgramIn order to cover social security contributions that arise in conjunction with transfers of shares to the Participants under the Program  the Board of Directors proposes that the AGM authorise the Board to approve transfers of own shares under the following terms:- Transfer shall be made on Nasdaq Stockholm (the ”Stock Exchange”).- Transfer can be made  on one or more occasions prior to the 2024 Annual General Meeting  of no more than 68 000  shares held by Bilia.- Transfer of shares on the Stock Exchange can only be made at a price per share that lies within the noted price range at any given time.- Transfer can only be made in exchange for cash payment.The maximum number of shares that can be transferred/acquired on the Stock Exchange may be recalculated in the event a bonus issue (with the issue of new shares)  stock split or reverse stock split occurs in Bilia  or if another event occurs that has occasioned recalculation of the number of shares to be transferred to the Participants under the Program.The Board of Directors intends to propose at future Annual General Meetings as well that the Annual General Meeting authorise the Board to approve transfer of own shares on the Stock Exchange to cover social security contributions that arise under the Program.TermsThe Board’s proposal that the AGM resolve to implement the Program is conditional on the AGM’s also deciding to adopt measures to guarantee the Program as stipulated above. The Board’s proposal that the AGM resolve to approve transfer of own shares is similarly conditional on the AGM’s decision to approve the Program and authorisation of transfer of own shares to cover social security contributions.Majority required for decisionA valid decision for item 17a above requires that the proposal be approved by shareholders holding more than one-half (1/2) of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the meeting. A valid decision for item 17b above requires that the proposal be approved by shareholders holding at least nine-tenths (9/10) of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the meeting. A valid decision for item 17c above requires that the proposal be approved by shareholders holding more than one-half (1/2) of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the meeting. A valid decision for item 17d above requires that the proposal be approved by shareholders holding more than two-thirds (2/3) of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the meeting.Processing of personal dataFor information on how your personal data is processed  please see:https://www.euroclear.com/dam/ESwithLegal/Privacy-notice-bolagsstammor-engelska.pdfFurther informationThe Annual report  auditor’s report  auditor’s statement on application of guidelines for remuneration to the Group Management  the board’s proposal for the long term incentive program and other documents to be provided prior to the AGM under the Swedish Companies Act and the Swedish Corporate Gernance Code will be available at Bilia AB at Norra Långebergsgatan 3 in Gothenburg and at www.bilia.com (menu header About us – Corporate Governance – General Meeting) not later than on 5 April 2023  and will be sent to shareholders who so request and provide their postal address.

The board of directors finds that it is in all shareholders' interest that senior executives  employees  and other key persons  which are considered important to the development of the company group  have a long-term interest in developing high value of the Company's share. A long-term ownership engagement is expected to stimulate an increased interest in the business and result in a whole as well as to increase the motivation for the participants and to create a common interest for the Company's shareholders and the participant.Resolutions in accordance with items 15a and 15b below shall be made as one resolution and are therefore conditional on each other.Item 15a: Resolution regarding issue of warrantsThe board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to issue a maximum of 160 000 warrants  which may result in a maximum increase in the Company's share capital of SEK 24 000.00.

The purpose is to establish conditions to maintain and increase the motivation of senior executives  employees  and other key persons within the Company and company group. The board of directors finds that it is in all shareholders' interest that senior executives  employees  and other key persons  which are considered important to the future development of the company group  have a long-term interest in developing high value of the Company's share. A long-term ownership engagement is expected to stimulate an increased interest in the business and result in a whole as well as to increase the motivation for the participants and to create a common interest for the Company's shareholders and the participant.The complete terms and conditions for the warrants  including conditions regarding re-calculation  in certain cases  of the subscription price and the number of shares a warrant entitles to  will be available at the Company no later than two weeks before the annual general meeting.The board of directors or a person nominated by it  shall be authorized to make such minor adjustments as may be required in connection with registration of the resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and  if applicable  Euroclear Sweden AB.Item 15b: Resolution regarding approval of transfer of warrantsThe board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to approve that the Company may transfer the number of warrants in the Subsidiary of series 2023/2026 that are not subscribed for by the categories as set out in item 15a to future senior executives  employees and other key persons within the Company and company group  or in any other matter dispose of the warrants to fulfill the obligations under Incentive Program 2023/2026.The Subsidiary shall be entitled to retain warrants that later may be offered to current (who are not subscribing for their whole offered part) and future senior executives  employees  and other key persons within the company group in accordance with the proposed acquisition and allotment principles.Future senior executives  employees  and key persons within the Company and company group will within Incentive Program 2023/2026  be offered to acquire warrants in accordance with the principles for allotment set out in item 15a.The board of directors of the Company will not participate in Incentive Program 2023/2026.Notification to acquire warrants shall be made during the period from 28 April 2023 up to and including 31 July 2023.Transfer of the warrants to participants shall be made at a price equal to the warrant's market value at the time of transfer  which shall be calculated according to the Black & Scholes valuation model or other generally accepted valuation model. Valuation of the options shall be performed by an independent appraiser  audit firm  or valuation expert.A general meeting in the Subsidiary shall also approve the transfer of warrants as above.Preparations for the proposalIncentive Program 2023/2026 has been prepared by the board of directors and external advisors.Incentive Program 2023/2026Subscription (except by the Subsidiary) and transfer of the warrants shall be made at a price equal to the warrant's fair market value. The warrants' fair market value  according to a preliminary valuation based on the market value of the underlying share of SEK 211  SEK 20.65 per warrant  assuming an exercise price of SEK 358.70 per share. The Black & Scholes valuation model has been used for the valuation  assuming a risk-free interest rate of 2.66 percent and a volatility of 35 percent  and assuming that no dividends and other distributions to shareholders are expected during the period of the program.As the warrants are subscribed and transferred at market value  it is the Company's assessment that no social costs will arise for the Company as a result of the subscription and the transfers. The costs will therefore only consist of limited costs for the implementation and administration of the Incentive Program 2023/2026.Other outstanding share-based incentive programsThe Company has previously established one incentive program  series 2020/2023 (""Warrant Program 2020/2023"").There are 500 000 outstanding warrants under the Warrant Program 2020/2023.

Trenching will initially target an area with 5.33g/t AuEq and then expand to add drill targets to the company's inventory at Pampa Paciencia.,"Vancouver  British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - March 28  2023) - Astra Exploration Inc. (TSXV: ASTR) (OTCQB: ATEPF) (FSE: S3I) (""Astra"" or the ""Company"") is pleased to announce that trenching operations have commenced at Pampa Paciencia  and Astra's shares are now listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (FSE) under the symbol ""S3I"".CEO Brian Miller commented:""PampaPaciencia is a large district  with known high gold grades and wide veins that has hardly been explored as evidenced by the discovery of the new western veins. This trenching program will follow-up the new 2 000 metres of vein subcrop that we have identified in the west of the Paciencia District in late 2022. Trenching will initially target an area with 5.33g/t AuEq and then expand to add drill targets to the company's inventory at Pampa Paciencia.""The Company mobilized equipment and personnel to the Impaciencia Oeste area of the Project during the week of March 19th to confirm and define newly discovered epithermal veins. Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) will be used to determine the thickness of caliche sediment in various areas of the project  and heavy equipment will be used to remove the caliche so that vein dimensions can be determined and geochemistry sampled.In Q4 of 2022  Company geologists discovered approximately 2 000 metres of vein subcrop (near-surface veins covered by thin sediment layer) and surface float containing gold and silver with grades up to 5.33 grams per tonne gold equivalent (AuEq = 80). This new discovery is located on the western side of the project  approximately five kilometres west of the Phase I and II drill programs.

(Euronext: ONWD)  the medical technology company creating innovative therapies to restore movement  independence  and health in people with spinal cord injury  today announces its 2022 financial and operating results. The full Annual Report is available here   on the Company’s website in the Investors section ( https://ir.onwd.com )  and on the website of the Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets ( www.afm.nl ).“I am proud of the volume and significance of our team’s achievements as we prepare for commercialization of our first therapy in late 2023 or early 2024 ” said Dave Marver  CEO of ONWARD. “We announced positive top-line results from our Up-LIFT pivotal study evaluating the use of our external ARC-EX Therapy to restore upper extremity function after spinal cord injury (SCI) and positive interim outcomes from our studies evaluating the use of our implantable ARC-IM Therapy to better regulate blood pressure after SCI. We also made progress in the development of the ARC-IM system to restore motor function  including the evaluation of our ARC-BCI platform  designed to augment ARC-IM Therapy to enable more natural movement. This first-of-its-kind system adds a brain-computer interface (BCI) that records a person’s intention to move and directs our spinal cord stimulation platform to enable that movement with ARC-IM Therapy.We added impactful talent to our Board of Directors and leadership team over the past 12 months. These new additions will help ONWARD scale and reach its vast potential. We are now implementing the operational and commercial capabilities required to successfully launch our first therapy.Story continuesWe expect several important milestones in 2023  including the first-in-human use of the ARC-IM Lead  the commencement of mobility studies for both SCI and Parkinson’s disease  the first-in-human use of the ARC-BCI platform to restore upper extremity function  the publication of detailed results from our Up-LIFT pivotal study  and regulatory clearance and first commercial sale of the ARC-EX device. It is an exciting time to be at ONWARD  and we are deeply motivated by the imperative to help people with SCI  their caregivers  and others with paralysis and movement disabilities.”The Company’s financial and operating highlights for 2022 and early 2023 include the following:Innovation and Clinical Development:In May 2022  the first participant was enrolled in the HemON feasibility study  a precursor to the Company’s planned pivotal trial  EMPOWER BP  evaluating ARC-IM Therapy to improve blood pressure regulation after SCI. This was also the first human use of the ARC-IM implantable pulse generator (IPG)  a proprietary  purpose-built implantable neurostimulator.In September 2022  ONWARD reported positive top-line results from its pivotal study  Up-LIFT  evaluating ARC-EX Therapy to restore movement after SCI. The study achieved its primary effectiveness endpoint of clinically meaningful improvement in upper extremity strength and function.In October 2022  the Company released data from the LIFT Home observational study  which evaluated the usability of ARC-EX Therapy in the home setting. Approximately 97% of at-home sessions were completed without usability issues  supporting the feasibility of home-based therapy.In December 2022  the Company reported positive interim clinical outcomes from the first ten people treated to better regulate blood pressure with ARC-IM Therapy. The therapy improved blood pressure levels in all study participants  who also reported improved quality of life  increased energy and vitality  and reduced dizziness.During 2022 and early 2023  the Company added five more FDA Breakthrough Device Designation awards (BDD). ONWARD now has eight BDDs  underscoring the innovative nature of its work.Science and Intellectual Property (IP):During 2022  the Company added 24 patents to its IP portfolio  now totaling more than 330 issued and pending patents. ONWARD also obtained option rights to license IP from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL) and Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV)  allowing ONWARD to develop and commercialize a novel brain-computer interface (BCI) platform  called ARC-BCI  that captures brain signals and wirelessly transmits a person’s intention to move to the Company’s ARC-IM platform to enable more natural movement.In November 2022  ONWARD and research partners at EPFL and CEA-Clinatec were awarded a grant from the European Innovation Council (EIC) to further develop ARC-BCI to restore mobility and upper limb function in people with SCI.The Company was also the First Place Winner of the 2022 BCI Award  which was granted to ONWARD and its research partners for their submission  “Walking naturally after spinal cord injury using a brain-spine interface.”Several important articles were published in major scientific journals during 2022. These included: In February 2022  Nature Medicine published results of the STIMO study highlighting the use of ARC-IM Therapy to enable people with even the most severe forms of SCI to stand and walk again; in April 2022  New England Journal of Medicine published the use of ONWARD’s innovative approach to treating orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure) in a patient with MSA-P  a severe form of Parkinson’s disease; in June 2022  Nature Neuroscience published pre-clinical research showing the potential for ONWARD ARC-IM Therapy to restore movement and function in hands and arms after SCI; in November 2022  Nature published pioneering work from ONWARD’s research partners at .NeuroRestore identifying the precise neurons that restore walking after paralysis. This paper also detailed the results from nine participants in the STIMO trial  all of whom could stand and walk with the benefit of ARC-IM Therapy.Corporate:In March 2022  the Company was added to Euronext Brussels’ Bel-Small Index.During 2022 and early 2023  several seasoned professionals joined ONWARD  each with the talent and experience to help the Company scale and reach its full potential: Kristina Dziekan and Vivian Riefberg were added to the Board of Directors. Kristina formerly led international reimbursement and market access for Medtronic Neuromodulation and served in a similar role at Alcon. Vivian was a senior partner with McKinsey & Company  where she co-led the US healthcare practice and led the US government practice; Vivian is currently the David C. Walentas Jefferson Scholars Chair Professor of Practice at the Darden School of Business at the University of Virginia. Lara Smith Weber joined as CFO and Zouhir Mechta as VP Operations. After spending nearly 20 years in various finance leadership roles in Europe  Lara led the Nasdaq IPO for MorphoSys. Zouhir brings expertise gained during a long career in operations leadership for Johnson & Johnson (J&J) and Dentsply Sirona. Erika Ross  VP Global Clinical & Regulatory and Sarah Moore  VP Global Marketing  joined ONWARD in early 2023. Erika was most recently at Abbott Neuromodulation  where she led clinical activities for their neuromodulation franchise  and was previously at Cala Health  where she managed the scientific research program that led to de novo clearance and launch of the company’s neurostimulation technology. Sarah joined from Nevro  an implantable neuromodulation company  where she served as Head of Commercial Marketing; she previously held various leadership roles in global marketing across multiple J&J medical device franchises.Financial:ONWARD reported an operating loss of EUR 32.0M in 2022  compared to EUR 28.6M in 2021.The Company ended the year with net cash of EUR 61.8M (2021: EUR 89.4M).Management reiterated its guidance of a cash runway through the end of 2024.“We expect our current cash to propel operations through the end of 2024  providing us a sound financial base as we grow the Company and prepare for commercial operations in 2023 ” commented Lara Smith Weber  CFO of ONWARD.Full Year Financial Summary:For the twelve-month period ended December 31In EUR millions  except for per-share data 2022 2021 Total Revenues & Other Income 2.1 1.4 Total Operating Expenses (34.2 ) (30.0 ) Operating Loss for the Period (32.0 ) (28.6 ) Net Finance Expense (1.5 ) (5.7 ) Income Tax Expense 0.8 (0.0 ) Net Loss for the Period (32.8 ) (34.3 ) Basic (and diluted) Earnings per Share (in EUR) (1.09 ) (3.62 ) At 31 Dec. 2022 31 Dec. 2021 Net cash at the end of the period 61.8 89.4Total Revenues & Other IncomeOther Income  mainly grant income  increased to EUR 2.1M (2021: EUR 1.4M) following an increase in US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) funding and new grants received from the European Innovation Council (EIC) and SMEs Executive Agency (EISMEA) and Eurostars.

The 2021 expense included the interest on the Company’s sources of funding from our innovation loan from Rijksdienst voor Ondernemend (RVO  a Dutch government funding vehicle for entrepreneurial ventures)  our convertible loan (CLA)  and the accrued dividend of preference A shares. Both the CLA and preference A shares converted to ordinary shares in October 2021. The 2022 expense is related to the innovation loan from RVO NL plus bank interest paid on our positive cash balance.Net Loss for the PeriodThe Company realized a Net Loss for the period of EUR 32.8 million vs. EUR 34.3 million in 2021. The decrease is driven by a lower Net Finance expense (see above).Net Cash PositionThe Company ended the year with a net cash position of EUR 61.8M (2021: EUR 89.4M)  comprising of cash and cash equivalents of EUR 41.8M and fixed term deposits of EUR 20.0M. Cash outflow from operating activities increased from EUR 19.9M in 2021 to EUR 26.7M in 2022 due to higher operating costs  partially offset by a decrease in non-cash adjustments (relating to share-based compensation and net finance costs) and a positive change in working capital.OutlookONWARD expects to achieve several important milestones in 2023:The Company plans to submit a de novo application for FDA clearance of its ARC-EX system during 2023  which ONWARD anticipates will result in regulatory authorization to commercialize that platform in the US in late 2023 or early 2024. The Company aims to obtain CE mark and European authorization in early 2024.The Company intends to publish detailed results from its Up-LIFT pivotal study for ARC-EX Therapy.ONWARD expects first-in-human use of its ARC-IM Lead  a purpose-designed lead that is optimized for placement along the spinal cord to stimulate the dorsal roots to restore mobility and autonomic function after SCI.The Company expects first-in-human use of ARC-BCI  its brain-computer interface platform. ONWARD is investigating ARC-BCI as its second-generation implantable platform to enable movement. The BCI platform harvests brain signals and wirelessly transmits a person’s intention to move to the Company’s ARC-IM system to enable more natural movement.ONWARD plans to continue to strengthen its organizational capabilities in preparation for the expected launch of ARC-EX in late 2023 or early 2024  recruiting field sales and service professionals and adding operational systems that will enable the Company to conduct commerce once FDA clearance and CE mark are received for the ARC-EX system. ONWARD will continue to recruit outstanding leaders with global experience and functional expertise who can help to scale effectively and realize the Company’s significant potential as a business.In 2023  ONWARD plans to pursue opportunities to further strengthen its balance sheet and extend its cash runway to support future investments in product development  the conduct of clinical trials  and the addition of operational and commercial capabilities.Conference Call & WebcastONWARD will host a conference call with live webcast on March 28  2023  at 2:00 PM CEST / 08:00 AM EDT.

(Euronext Paris: QDT)  a leader in business solutions for meaningful customer connections through digital and physical channels  announces today its 2022 fourth-quarter consolidated sales and full-year results (period ended on 31 January 2023). The full-year 2022 results were approved by the Board of Directors during a meeting held on Friday 24 March 2023.Story continuesGeoffrey Godet  Chief Executive Officer of Quadient S.A.  stated: “As we continue to make progress in the execution of our Back to Growth strategy  this year’s results benefited from a strong finish  demonstrating Quadient’s ability to reposition itself on core markets and geographies  adapt its business to a recurring subscription model while investing in solutions recognized for their leadership. This year  we posted a moderate but positive annual organic revenue growth  with a particularly robust Q4 across all solutions  while the operating profitability showed a marked improvement in H2 vs H1. Our cloud Software Solution performed strongly with a more than 20% record organic growth in Annual Recurring Revenue  driving double-digit organic growth in subscription-related revenue. With the transition from license sales to SaaS subscription nearly completed  this revenue growth is now reflected in an improving profitability trend  as already seen in the second part of the year. Mail-Related Solutions achieved a stunning performance in posting organic growth for the second consecutive year  while succeeding to maintain a high level of profitability. In addition  Mail-Related Solutions delivered strong hardware sales levels and benefitted from record cross sell between Quadient’s mailing equipment customers and its Software Solutions. Finally  Parcel Locker Solutions showed attractive growth in our European geographies while the overall performance was impacted by a high comparison basis in Q1 as well as delays in retail and residential projects in the US.Two years into the second phase of our strategic plan  we have reached a turning point in the evolution of the Group with the divestments of the remaining non-core activities  leading to the end of the Additional Operations segment and the simplification of our financial reporting. We continue to leverage our unique state-of-the-art software and smart hardware platform to drive the synergistic development of the entire Group and achieve our medium-term ambitions. Our integrated and subscription-based business model is proving very resilient in the current macro context and our ability to cross-sell and upsell our comprehensive product range to our more than 440 000 enterprises and SMB customers makes the Group uniquely positioned to continue to grow its top line while also delivering improved profitability.”A SOLID Q4 PERFORMANCE DRIVES 1.4% ORGANIC REVENUE GROWTH IN FY 2022Group sales stood at €1 081 million in FY 2022  a 1.4% organic growth compared to FY 2021 and a 5.6% increase on a reported basis. The variation includes a positive currency impact of +6.2% or €64 million and a negative scope effect of (2.1)% or €(21) million. The changes of scope are related to the acquisition of Beanworks in March 2021  the divestment of Automated Packaging Systems in July 2021 as well as the more recent divestments of the Graphic activities in the Nordics and the Shipping business in France (both in June 2022).Segment reporting evolution and accounting changesThe sale of the Graphics activities in the Nordics and of the Shipping business in France have completed the reshaping of the Additional Operations portfolio. The remaining activities in the Additional Operations segment were mostly related to Mail-Related Solutions and Parcel Locker Solutions activities in non-core geographies  which are now being integrated into the existing Solutions activities starting at the FY 2022 reporting.The end of the Additional Operations segment has led the Group to re-organise its segment reporting based on an approach by Solution rather than the prior approach by geographies. Consequently  the Group will now provide  in addition to the revenue by Solution  the associated current EBIT(2). Details of the new reporting segments are being provided starting in FY 2022 and a pro forma FY 2021 is also shown for comparison basis.Aside from the simplification effort in segment reporting  the FY 2022 current EBIT2  both at the Group and at Solution levels  was impacted by the new IFRIC accounting standard on Cloud Software investments. At Group level  the FY 2022 negative impact on current EBIT2 was €(5) million.Consolidated sales and current EBIT2 by SolutionConsolidated SalesIn € million FY 2022 FY 2021pro forma(a) Change Organic change1 Intelligent Communication Automation 227 201 +12.8% +6.3% Mail-Related Solutions 757 710(a) +6.7% +0.1% Parcel Locker Solutions 91 86(a) +5.6% +0.4% Other solutions divested in 2022 5 27(a) (80.4)% +12.5% Group total 1 081 1 024 +5.6% +1.4% (a) Mail-Related Solutions and Parcel Locker Solutions now includes activities previously accounting for in Additional Operations.Current EBIT(a) and EBIT Margin (a)FY 2022(Including new 2022 IFRIC) FY 2022(Excluding new 2022 IFRIC) FY 2021 pro forma(b)(no IFRIC impact) In € million Current EBIT(c) EBIT Margin(c) Current EBIT(c) EBIT Margin(c) Current EBIT EBIT Margin Intelligent Communication Automation (10) (4.5)% (9) (4.1)% (3) (1.6)% Mail-Related Solutions 186 24.5% 189 25.0% 171 24.1% Parcel Locker Solutions (25) (27.8)% (25) (27.4)% (19) (22.0)% Other solutions divested in 2022 (0) (5.3)% (0) (5.3)% (2) (8.6)% Group total 150 13.9% 155 14.3% 147 14.3%(a) Before acquisition-related expenses(b) Mail-Related Solutions and Parcel Locker Solutions now includes activities previously accounting for in Additional Operations.(c) 2022 current EBIT and EBIT margin were negatively impacted by the €5 million negative impact from the new IFRIC accounting standard for cloud computingIntelligent Communication AutomationSales from Intelligent Communication Automation were up 6.3% organically and 12.8% on a reported basis to €227 million. Subscription-related revenue continues to grow at a double-digit rate closing the year on an 18.5% organic growth. Q4 marked a further acceleration of the organic growth trend reaching 22.1% for the quarter. Record year for cross selling software modules to Mail-Related Solutions customers and several large subscription deals (>€1 million/year each) signed in 2022 have both contributed to this solid performance. It is also worth highlighting the fast organic increase in revenues delivered by Quadient’s Account Receivables and Account Payables modules growing at over 50% for the FY 2022. Overall  demand for Quadient’s cloud-based offering has remained strong throughout FY 2022 with each quarter of the year posting a double-digit organic increase in subscription-related revenue  which now accounts for 75% of Intelligent Communication Automation total sales in 2022 compared to only 67% in FY 2021.The share of SaaS customers reached 80% at the end of FY 2022  a further increase compared to 76% in FY 2021  also highlighting the progress made in the change in business model from license sales to a cloud-based offer. Annual recurring revenue set a new record  reaching €187 million at the end of FY 2022  up from €145 million at the end of FY 2021  representing a 22% organic increase7. Annual recurring revenue is a forward-looking indicator of future subscription-related organic growth  which is expected to further accelerate in FY 2023.With the strong increase in Subscription-related revenue  the weight of license sales continues to decrease  now only representing 8% of total Solution sales. License sales decreased by 37.6% organically in FY 2022 bringing the transformation of the business model close to completion. The negative impact of this transition on the Solution growth should therefore be more limited going forward. Professional services were slightly down organically  by 5.4%  professional services revenue being directly linked to the evolution in product mix.Current EBIT2 for Intelligent Communication Automation was negative at €(10) million  leading to an EBIT margin2 of (4.5)%. The operating profitability of Intelligent Communication Automation was mainly impacted in the first half of the year by the high inflation weighing on personnel costs  a return to normalised marketing expenses post-Covid and additional costs linked to the launch of new modules in selected European countries. The second half of the year showed a marked improvement in current EBIT2 with an EBIT margin moving from (9.7)% in H1 to 0.2% in H2 thanks to the increase in revenue and in gross margin as well as to a tight cost control  lower impact from salary inflation and reduced travel expenses. Furthermore  the on-going change in business model continues to impact the Solution profitability  whereas H1 2022 was also impacted by a high comparison basis due to a large license deal signed in Q2 2021.Current EBIT2 for the Solution is expected to improve in FY 2023 driven by the rising profitability of the installed base  the contribution from the phasing of the prices increases and the contribution from the growing revenue. In addition  the negative impact from the change in business model should continue to decline thanks to the lower weight of license sales in the revenue mix.Mail-Related SolutionsMail-Related Solutions sales reached €757 million in FY 2022  up 6.8% on a reported basis and slightly up organically (+0.1%). Revenue from Mail-Related Solutions now includes former Additional Operations Mail activities in non-core geographies for €51m. This is the second consecutive year of organic increase  a remarkable performance for Mail-Related Solutions as it comes against a high comparison basis (a 1.8% organic growth in the FY 2021) and while the second half of the year was impacted by supply chain disruption. Looking at the geographic contributions  this outstanding performance was mostly driven by organic growth from North America (both subscription-related revenue and license & hardware sales)  while the Main European countries showed contrasted contributions.The solid performance in hardware sales also continued with a 4.3% organic increase in FY 2022  fuelled by a very strong Q4 at +9.1% organic growth. Quadient’s strategy to renew its product offering is bearing fruits with an increasing penetration of the new generation of products. The share of the upgraded installed base is reaching 19.9% at the end of FY 2022  vs 11.7% at the end of FY 2021. Placement of remanufactured mailing equipment is also gathering pace with the remanufacturing level reaching 73% at the end of the year  well ahead of the 50% level targeted by the Group for 2023.Subscription-related revenues (69% of Mail-Related Solutions sales) recorded a limited 1.7% decline in FY 2022. This solid performance is driven by both the resilience of the installed base and the multi-year largely indexed contracts.Current EBIT2 for Mail-Related Solutions was €186 million for FY 2022 including a c.€(3) million negative impact from the new IFRIC accounting standard for cloud computing. Current EBIT margin for FY 2022 was 24.5%. The high profitability level of Mail-Related Solutions is even more remarkable given the high inflationary environment as well as still high freight costs. Record cross-selling of Intelligent Communication Software leading to increased costs synergies  strong focus on costs control  continuous increase in remanufacturing placements and the benefit from the indexation have all contributed to this solid performance.Current EBIT2 for the Solution is expected to remain solid in FY 2023 supported by a tight focus on cost control  a positive outlook in North America and further penetration of new generation mail equipment.Parcel Locker SolutionsParcel Locker Solutions sales increased by 5.6% to €91 million in FY 2022  a 0.4% organic increase compared to FY 2021. FY 2022 revenue includes Lockers activities in non-core geographies from the former Additional Operations segment for €4 million.License and hardware sales were down 12.6% organically in FY 2022 impacted  on the one hand  by an unfavourable comparison basis linked to the final phase of the deployment of a large North American retail contract in Q1 2021  and  on the other hand  by the delays in retail and residential projects in the US.Subscription-related revenues were up 10.0% organically supported by the deployment of existing contracts  solid usage rate (standing at 64% at the end of FY 2022) and the benefits from price increases on the installed base. Subscription-related revenue stands at 59% of total revenue for Parcel Locker Solutions.The deployment of a new open network of lockers in the UK  launched in June 2022  is gathering momentum. DPD  DHL and Evri have all officially announced that they will use the network for the delivery of their volumes  while a fourth carrier has recently also joined the network. The targeted number of installed lockers is set at 5 000  to be deployed in the coming years.Quadient’s global installed locker base reached 18 000+ units at the end of FY 2022.Current EBIT2 for Parcel Locker Solutions was negative at €(25) million in 2022  with a current EBIT margin of (27.8)%. Current EBIT margin for the existing installed base was 12.5% vs 11.3% a year ago. Profitability in 2022 has been impacted by several one-off factors  namely:i) Increased costs associated with the development and the launch of new products ii) Go-to-market and initial deployment costs associated with the new UK open-network  andiii) Delays in retail deals and residential installations in the US.Profitability is expected to increase in FY 2023 supported by declining freight costs  lower costs associated with product launches and the UK open network as well as the rising profitability of the installed base and benefits from the phasing of price increases.Consolidated sales by geographiesIn € million FY 2022 FY 2021Pro forma Change Organic change1 North America 599 519 +15.4% +3.0% Main European countries(a) 372 376 (1.0)% (1.4)% International(b) 110 128 (14.7)% +3.6% Group total 1 081 1 024 +5.6% +1.4% (a) Including Austria  Benelux  France  Germany  Ireland  Italy  Switzerland  and the United Kingdom.(b) International includes the activities of Intelligent Communication Automation  Mail-Related Solutions and Parcel Locker Solutions outside of North America and the Main European countries as well as divested other solutions previously recorded under Additional Operations.Sales in North America (55% of Group sales) were up 3.0% organically to €599 million and 15.4% on a reported basis. Solid hardware sales for Mail-Related Solutions as well as a strong performance from Intelligent Communication Automation were the main contributors to the growth in the region. Penetration of Quadient’s cloud-based solutions continues to be well supported by successful cross-selling with two-thirds of new Software customers coming from the Mail customer base. Quadient’s Account Receivables and Account Payables solutions also performed well in the region contributing to the overall solid performance for the year. Parcel Locker Solutions  however  suffered from both delays in the deployment of retail and residential projects and from a high comparison basis with the completion of the roll-out of a large retail contract in Q1 2021.Main European countries (34% of Group sales) were marginally down by 1.4% on an organic basis to €372 million. Performance has been contrasted by countries and by Solution in this region. Mail-Related Solutions performed well in terms of hardware sales in most European countries except for France. For Intelligent Communication Automation  penetration of the recently launched Account Receivables and Account Payables modules have started to contribute to the growth in the region but the decline in license sales due to the change in business model continues to impact the overall growth. Parcel Locker Solutions was the main contributor to growth in the region (+c.50% on an organic basis)  benefiting from the on-going deployment of the recently signed contracts most notably in France.The International segment (10% of Group sales) delivered a 3.6% organic growth  to €110 million  mostly driven by the good dynamics of both Intelligent Communication Automation and Parcel Locker Solutions.Q4 2022 SALESConsolidated sales stood at €288 million in the fourth quarter of 2022  up 5.5% on a reported basis and 3.1% on an organic basis compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. A solid performance driven by all three Solutions and all geographies  demonstrating an acceleration of the revenue growth trend through the year.In € million Q4 2022 Q4 2021Pro forma Change Organicchange1 Intelligent Communication Automation 61 54 +13.1% +9.0% Mail-Related Solutions 202 193 +4.9% +0.9% Parcel Locker Solutions 25 23 +9.6% +7.5% Other solutions divested in 2022 0 4 (100)% (100)% Group total 288 273 +5.5% +3.1%Intelligent Communication Automation sales were strongly up with 9.0% organic growth to €61 million after a slower Q3 2022  the Subscription-related revenue showing the strongest organic growth of the year at +22.1%  more than offsetting the decline in license sales.Mail-Related Solutions sales continued to show strong resilience  reaching €202 million  up by 0.9% on an organic basis benefiting from the reduction of the backlog despite further supply chain issues.Parcel Locker Solutions sales stood at €25 million in Q4 2022  with a +7.5% organic growth compared to Q4 2021 thanks to the ongoing deployment of existing contracts in France and the UK.In € million Q4 2022 Q4 2021 Change Organicchange1 North America 157 141 +10.9% +2.8% Main European countries(a) 101 99 +2.3% +2.6% International(b) 30 32 (8.2)% +5.8% Group total 288 273 +5.5% +3.1% (a) Including Austria  Benelux  France  Germany  Ireland  Italy  Switzerland  and the United Kingdom.(b) International includes the activities of Intelligent Communication Automation  Mail-Related Solutions and Parcel Locker Solutions outside of North America and the Main European countries.North America posted 2.8% organic growth in the quarter  with a double-digit growth in Intelligent Communication Automation and Mail-Related Solutions posting positive organic growth.Main European Countries posted a 2.6% organic growth  fuelled by a remarkable performance of both Mail-Related Solutions and Parcel Locker Solutions  the latter benefitting from the development of the recent contracts in France.International grew +5.8% organically with all solutions contributing to the growth.REVIEW OF 2022 FULL-YEAR RESULTSSimplified P&LIn € million FY 2022(including IFRIC) FY 2021(No IFRIC impact) Change Sales 1 081 1 024 +5.6% Gross profit 790 744 +6.2% Gross margin 73.1% 72.6% EBITDA 240 245 (2.0)% EBITDA margin 22.2% 23.9% Current operating income before acquisition-related expenses 150 147 +2.2% Current operating income margin (before acquisition related expenses) 13.9% 14.3% Current operating income 140 135 +3.5% Optimization expenses and other operating income & expenses (73) (19) n.m.

Net attributable income 13 88 (84.9)% Earnings per share 0.29 2.32 Diluted earnings per share 0.29 2.17Gross margin improved to 73.1% in FY 2022 compared to 72.6% in FY 2021. A solid performance achieved in difficult conditions with the high inflation level impacting all costs aspects and freight costs still at elevated levels. Tight cost control as well as the positive business development and price increases all contributed to this improvement in gross margin.Current operating income before acquisition-related expenses increased to €150 million in FY 2022 compared to €147 million in FY 2021  up 2.2% on a reported basis and down 4.8% on an organic3 basis. The current operating income before acquisition-related expenses includes a €5 million negative impact from the new IFRIC rule for cloud computing. Current operating margin before acquisition-related expenses stood at 13.9% of sales in 2022 compared to 14.3% in 2021. Excluding the negative IFRIC impact  the current operating margin before acquisition-related expenses would have been stable year over year at 14.3%. The Group’s operating profitability was impacted by higher personnel costs  increased R&D  and go-to-market spendings. Investments into scaling the network of parcel lockers with the launch of the UK open network also weighed on profitability as well as the recent delays in retail and residential lockers projects in the US. Price increases through the year  the benefit of indexation for part of the Group’s installed base as well as tight cost control helped mitigate these negative elements. As anticipated  H2 current EBIT margin showed a marked improvement versus H1 2022 level  at 16.1% excluding IFRIC vs 12.5%. The solid H2 performance was driven by all three Solutions with notably Intelligent Communication Automation showing strong recovery while Mail-Related Solutions managed to further improve an already high level of profitability.With no significant M&A activities in FY 2022  acquisition-related expenses declined slightly to €10 million in FY 2022  compared to €12 million in 2021. Consequently  current operating income stood at €140 million in 2022 including the negative IFRIC impact  compared to €135 million in FY 2021.Optimization costs and other operating expenses stood at €73 million in FY 2022  versus €19 million in FY 2021. In particular  this included:i) Goodwill impairment for €48 million  resulting from the WACC increase in UK  Ireland and DACHIT regions and tax rate increase in the UKii) Real estate write-offs linked to the optimisation of the office footprint for a total amount of €16 millionIncluding these non-current items  operating income for FY 2022 was €67 million  versus €116 million recorded in FY 2021.Net attributable income2022 net cost of debt was marginally up year-on-year at €27 million  against €25 million in FY 2021. The increase is mainly due to the refinancing of the ODIRNANE instrument  which was booked in equity  through the emission of Schuldschein debt in November 2021.The currency gains & losses and other financial items were a loss of €9 million in 2022 versus a gain of €17 million in FY 2021. This is partly due to a decrease of €5 million in the fair value of the investment made by Quadient in private equity funds X’Ange 2 and Partech Entrepreneurs while  in FY 2021  currency gains and other financial items benefited from the €20 million increase in the fair value of these investments.Overall  net financial result was a loss of €36 million in FY 2022 compared to a loss of €8 million in FY 2021.Income tax decreased to €16 million in FY 2022 versus €20 million in FY 2021. This is mainly due to the favourable impact of a tax loss carry forward recognition  partly offset by an increase in the tax charge in the United States.The corporate tax rate stood at 54.8% in FY 2022 compared to 18.1% in FY 2021. This high rate is mainly owing to the impairment of goodwill recorded this year. Restated for this item  the corporate tax rate would be 21.4% and marks a return to a more normal level.Net attributable income after minority interest amounted to €13 million in FY 2022 compared to €88 million in FY 2021.Earnings per share8 stood at €0.29 in FY 2022 compared to €2.32 in FY 2021.Proposed dividend at €0.60 per share for the FY 2022  a 9% increase against the FY 2021 dividend. The dividend is subject to approval by the Annual General Meeting  scheduled for 16 June 2023  and will be paid in cash in one instalment on 7 August 2023.Cash flow generationEBITDA9F9 was €240 million in FY 2022 compared to €245 million in FY 2021. EBITDA margin decreased from 23.9% in FY 2021 to 22.2% in FY 2022. Excluding the negative IFRIC impact  EBITDA margin for the FY 2022 would have been 22.7%. The decline in EBITDA margin was mainly due to increased go to market efforts to support the Group’s growth engines  product launches in new geographies as well as the impact from salary inflation.The change in working capital was negative by €38 million in FY 2022 compared to a net cash outflow of €8 million in FY 2021. The degradation in working capital was primarily driven by the higher level of inventories at the end of the year due to both supply chain disruptions for the Mail business and delays in retail and residential projects for the Parcel Locker Solutions. The slower collection of receivables compared to the exceptional level in FY 2021 (catch up impact post Covid-19 crisis) also impacted the working capital.Lease receivables recorded a remarkable small decrease of only €8 million in FY 2022 compared to a decrease of €39 million in FY 2021. This extremely solid performance has been achieved thanks to the high level of hardware placement for Mail-Related Solutions  which in turns slows the decline of the leasing portfolio.The leasing portfolio and other financing services is stable at €595 million as of 31 January 2023  the same level as of 31 January 2022 helped by a positive currency impact. On an organic basis  this represents a slower decrease of 1.4% at the end of FY 2022 compared to a decrease 6.4% at the end of FY 2021. At the end of FY 2022  the default rate of the leasing portfolio stood at around 1.6% compared to 1.7% at the end of FY 2021.Interest and taxes paid decreased significantly to €35 million in FY 2022 versus €66 million in FY 2021. The lower amount paid in 2022 is mostly explained by the reimbursement of the 2020 tax loss carry-back measures in the US.Capital expenditure remained stable in 2022 at €88 million. Development capex was also stable at €36 million in 2022 (vs. €37 million in FY 2021) and was mostly spent on R&D investments for software developments and Parcel lockers innovations. Rented equipment capex was slightly up year-over-year at €30 million in FY 2022  compared to €29 million in FY 2021  thanks to the sustained level of Mail-Related Solutions hardware placements  the on-going deployment of Parcel Locker Solutions contracts in France and Japan as well as the start of the installation of the new UK open network. The small increase in maintenance capex  to €13 million  was mostly linked to software projects and IT equipment spendings. To be noted  while previously capitalised  cloud computing investments are now expensed or moved to prepaid expenses in line with the new IFRIC accounting standard for an amount of €8 million.Consequently  cash flow after capital expenditure for the year was down to €70 million in FY 2022 compared to €104 million in FY 2021.LEVERAGE AND LIQUIDITY POSITIONNet debt stood at €722 million as of 31 January 2023  an increase against the €504 million of net financial debt recorded as of 31 January 2022 but this represents a significant decrease versus the €769 million  comprising the 2021 net financial debt plus the €265 million ODIRNANE facility accounted for as equity. Therefore  the overall financial structure for the Group has improved significantly in FY 2022 despite the increase in debt level which is due to the repayment in full of the ODIRNANE instrument in June 2022. The ODIRNANE was repaid following the successful issuance of a €270 Schuldschein emission in November 2021. The Group has no significant debt maturity before its €325 million 2.25% bond maturing in 2025.The leverage ratio (net debt/EBITDA) improved slightly to 3.0x5 as of 31 January 2023 versus 3.1x5 as of 31 January 2022 (adjusted for the ODIRNANE). Excluding leasing and adjusted for the ODIRNANE  the leverage ratio also improved to 1.8x5 as of 31 January 2023 vs 2.0x5 at the end of FY 2021 (31 January 2022). The Group remains focused on reaching its leverage ratio target of 1.75x5 excluding leasing as of 31 January 2024.As of 31 January 2023  the Group had a robust liquidity position of €572 million  split between €172 million in cash and a €400 million undrawn credit line  the latter maturing in 2024.Shareholders’ equity stood at € 1 082 million as of 31 January 2023 compared to €1 359 million as of 31 January 2022. The gearing ratio121010 went up to 66.7% as of 31 January 2023 from 37.1% as of 31 January 2022 due to the mechanical impact from the ODIRNANE reimbursement (double impact from lower equities and higher debt).OUTLOOKFY 2023 guidance allows to confirm the 2021-2023 financial outlookRevenue guidanceSales outlook is confirmed at minimum 3% organic sales CAGR over 2021-23FY 2023 organic sales growth is expected c.3%.Current EBIT2 guidanceCurrent EBIT 2 outlook is confirmed at minimum mid-single digit organic 6 current EBIT 2 CAGR over 2021-23FY 2023 organic growth in current EBIT2 is expected at c.10%.In terms of the organic revenue growth  FY 2023 is expected to benefit from the positive trend in Annual Recurring Revenue for Intelligent Communication Automation  which grew at +22% organically in FY 2022 and is expected to translate into a similar level of subscription-related revenue growth in FY 2023. In addition  solid cross-selling and upselling dynamics should also continue to drive growth in future bookings. As the weight of licenses sales continues to decrease  growth for Intelligent Communication Automation is expected to gradually move closer to the subscription-related revenue growth.After two remarkable years of organic growth for Mail-Related Solutions  driven by solid hardware placements and some benefits from price increases  the outlook for FY 2023 is cautiously optimistic thanks to further benefits from price increases and further upgrade of the installed base.Parcel Locker Solutions should deliver strong organic growth in FY 2023 supported by the rising contribution of the larger installed base as well as some catch up in installations in the US following the delays recorded in FY 2022 in the residential and retail sectors.Turning to the current EBIT2  the improvement in profitability is expected to be driven by:i) The rising profitability of the installed base for both the SaaS activity and parcel lockers ii) Continued improvement in current EBIT(1) for Intelligent Communication Automation as the transition to SaaS is almost completed  significant increase in current EBIT2 expected for Parcel Locker Solutions driven by acceleration of locker placements  whilst Mail-Related Solutions current EBIT2 margin should remain high thanks to careful price control  andiii) Lower freight costs.However  salary inflation is expected to continue.BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTSQuadient launches Parcel Pending smart lockers in Ireland to support on-going modernization of the residential property industryOn 8 November 2022  Quadient announced the launch of Parcel Pending by Quadient in Ireland.

(Euronext Growth Paris: ALTME)  a biotechnology company focused on developing novel therapies for treatment of cancer by targeting the tumor microenvironment (TME)  announced today a clinical update on survival of newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients in the GLORIA expansion arm evaluating NOX-A12  TME Pharma's CXCL12 inhibitor  in combination with standard of care radiotherapy and anti-VEGF  bevacizumab.After 12 months on study (median)  83% of patients (5 of 6) are still alive. With treatment or follow-up for these patients continuing  median overall survival (mOS) has not yet been reached. The 12-month timepoint is an important landmark for assessment since it exceeds the expected survival of approximately 10 months for patients with MGMT unmethylated tumors and incomplete resection1.""We are pleased to see that data emerging from the expansion arm with NOX-A12 and bevacizumab continue to support our approach. With this trend  we expect NOX-A12 in combination with bevacizumab to outperform the treatment with NOX-A12 alone  for which we reported a median overall survival of 12.7 months. We will continue to provide clinical updates as the data mature and look forward to reporting updated survival data around the 15-month timepoint when we target a presentation at an international scientific congress "" said Aram Mangasarian  CEO of TME Pharma.For more information  please contact:TME Pharma N.V.Aram Mangasarian  Ph.D.  CEO Tel. +49 (0) 30 726247 0investors@tmepharma.com1 Kreth 2013  Annals of Oncology 24:3117.

The company's oncology-focused pipeline is designed to act on the tumor microenvironment (TME) and the cancer immunity cycle by breaking tumor protection barriers against the immune system and blocking tumor repair. By neutralizing chemokines in the TME  TME Pharma's approach works in combination with other forms of treatment to weaken tumor defenses and enable greater therapeutic impact. In the GLORIA clinical trial  TME Pharma is studying its lead drug candidate NOX-A12 in newly diagnosed brain cancer patients who will not benefit clinically from standard chemotherapy. TME Pharma has delivered top-line data from the NOX-A12 three dose-escalation cohorts combined with radiotherapy of the GLORIA clinical trial  observing consistent tumor reductions and objective tumor responses. Additionally  GLORIA expansion arms evaluate safety and efficacy of NOX-A12 in other combinations where the interim results from the triple combination of NOX-A12  radiotherapy and bevacizumab suggest even deeper and more durable responses. NOX-A12 in combination with radiotherapy has received orphan drug designation for glioblastoma in the United States and glioma in Europe. TME Pharma has delivered final top-line data with encouraging overall survival and safety profile from its NOX-A12 combination trial with Keytruda® in metastatic colorectal and pancreatic cancer patients  which was published in the Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer in October 2021. The company has entered in its second collaboration with MSD/Merck for its Phase 2 study  OPTIMUS  to further evaluate safety and efficacy of NOX-A12 in combination with Merck's Keytruda® and two different chemotherapy regimens as second-line therapy in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. The design of the trial has been approved in France and Spain and is in discussion with regulatory authorities in the United States. The company's second clinical-stage drug candidate  NOX-E36  is designed to target the innate immune system. TME Pharma is considering several solid tumors for further clinical development.

GLORIA further evaluates safety and efficacy of NOX-A12 three additional arms combining NOX-A12 with: A. radiotherapy in patients with complete tumor resection; B. radiotherapy and bevacizumab; and C. radiotherapy and pembrolizumab.About the OPTIMUS StudyOPTIMUS (NCT04901741) is TME Pharma's planned open-label two-arm Phase 2 study of NOX-A12 combined with pembrolizumab and nanoliposomal irinotecan/5-FU/leucovorin or gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel in microsatellite-stable metastatic pancreatic cancer patients.DisclaimerTranslations of any press release into languages other than English are intended solely as a convenience to the non-English-reading audience.

(Euronext: ONWD)  the medical technology company creating innovative therapies to restore movement  independence  and health in people with spinal cord injury  today announces its 2022 financial and operating results. The full Annual Report is available here   on the Company’s website in the Investors section ( https://ir.onwd.com )  and on the website of the Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets ( www.afm.nl ).“I am proud of the volume and significance of our team’s achievements as we prepare for commercialization of our first therapy in late 2023 or early 2024 ” said Dave Marver  CEO of ONWARD. “We announced positive top-line results from our Up-LIFT pivotal study evaluating the use of our external ARC-EX Therapy to restore upper extremity function after spinal cord injury (SCI) and positive interim outcomes from our studies evaluating the use of our implantable ARC-IM Therapy to better regulate blood pressure after SCI. We also made progress in the development of the ARC-IM system to restore motor function  including the evaluation of our ARC-BCI platform  designed to augment ARC-IM Therapy to enable more natural movement. This first-of-its-kind system adds a brain-computer interface (BCI) that records a person’s intention to move and directs our spinal cord stimulation platform to enable that movement with ARC-IM Therapy.We added impactful talent to our Board of Directors and leadership team over the past 12 months. These new additions will help ONWARD scale and reach its vast potential. We are now implementing the operational and commercial capabilities required to successfully launch our first therapy.We expect several important milestones in 2023  including the first-in-human use of the ARC-IM Lead  the commencement of mobility studies for both SCI and Parkinson’s disease  the first-in-human use of the ARC-BCI platform to restore upper extremity function  the publication of detailed results from our Up-LIFT pivotal study  and regulatory clearance and first commercial sale of the ARC-EX device. It is an exciting time to be at ONWARD  and we are deeply motivated by the imperative to help people with SCI  their caregivers  and others with paralysis and movement disabilities.”The Company’s financial and operating highlights for 2022 and early 2023 include the following:Innovation and Clinical Development:In May 2022  the first participant was enrolled in the HemON feasibility study  a precursor to the Company’s planned pivotal trial  EMPOWER BP  evaluating ARC-IM Therapy to improve blood pressure regulation after SCI. This was also the first human use of the ARC-IM implantable pulse generator (IPG)  a proprietary  purpose-built implantable neurostimulator.In September 2022  ONWARD reported positive top-line results from its pivotal study  Up-LIFT  evaluating ARC-EX Therapy to restore movement after SCI. The study achieved its primary effectiveness endpoint of clinically meaningful improvement in upper extremity strength and function.In October 2022  the Company released data from the LIFT Home observational study  which evaluated the usability of ARC-EX Therapy in the home setting. Approximately 97% of at-home sessions were completed without usability issues  supporting the feasibility of home-based therapy.In December 2022  the Company reported positive interim clinical outcomes from the first ten people treated to better regulate blood pressure with ARC-IM Therapy. The therapy improved blood pressure levels in all study participants  who also reported improved quality of life  increased energy and vitality  and reduced dizziness.During 2022 and early 2023  the Company added five more FDA Breakthrough Device Designation awards (BDD). ONWARD now has eight BDDs  underscoring the innovative nature of its work.Science and Intellectual Property (IP):During 2022  the Company added 24 patents to its IP portfolio  now totaling more than 330 issued and pending patents. ONWARD also obtained option rights to license IP from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL) and Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV)  allowing ONWARD to develop and commercialize a novel brain-computer interface (BCI) platform  called ARC-BCI  that captures brain signals and wirelessly transmits a person’s intention to move to the Company’s ARC-IM platform to enable more natural movement.In November 2022  ONWARD and research partners at EPFL and CEA-Clinatec were awarded a grant from the European Innovation Council (EIC) to further develop ARC-BCI to restore mobility and upper limb function in people with SCI.The Company was also the First Place Winner of the 2022 BCI Award  which was granted to ONWARD and its research partners for their submission  “Walking naturally after spinal cord injury using a brain-spine interface.”Several important articles were published in major scientific journals during 2022. These included: In February 2022  Nature Medicine published results of the STIMO study highlighting the use of ARC-IM Therapy to enable people with even the most severe forms of SCI to stand and walk again; in April 2022  New England Journal of Medicine published the use of ONWARD’s innovative approach to treating orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure) in a patient with MSA-P  a severe form of Parkinson’s disease; in June 2022  Nature Neuroscience published pre-clinical research showing the potential for ONWARD ARC-IM Therapy to restore movement and function in hands and arms after SCI; in November 2022  Nature published pioneering work from ONWARD’s research partners at .NeuroRestore identifying the precise neurons that restore walking after paralysis. This paper also detailed the results from nine participants in the STIMO trial  all of whom could stand and walk with the benefit of ARC-IM Therapy.Corporate:In March 2022  the Company was added to Euronext Brussels’ Bel-Small Index.During 2022 and early 2023  several seasoned professionals joined ONWARD  each with the talent and experience to help the Company scale and reach its full potential: Kristina Dziekan and Vivian Riefberg were added to the Board of Directors. Kristina formerly led international reimbursement and market access for Medtronic Neuromodulation and served in a similar role at Alcon. Vivian was a senior partner with McKinsey & Company  where she co-led the US healthcare practice and led the US government practice; Vivian is currently the David C. Walentas Jefferson Scholars Chair Professor of Practice at the Darden School of Business at the University of Virginia. Lara Smith Weber joined as CFO and Zouhir Mechta as VP Operations. After spending nearly 20 years in various finance leadership roles in Europe  Lara led the Nasdaq IPO for MorphoSys. Zouhir brings expertise gained during a long career in operations leadership for Johnson & Johnson (J&J) and Dentsply Sirona. Erika Ross  VP Global Clinical & Regulatory and Sarah Moore  VP Global Marketing  joined ONWARD in early 2023. Erika was most recently at Abbott Neuromodulation  where she led clinical activities for their neuromodulation franchise  and was previously at Cala Health  where she managed the scientific research program that led to de novo clearance and launch of the company’s neurostimulation technology. Sarah joined from Nevro  an implantable neuromodulation company  where she served as Head of Commercial Marketing; she previously held various leadership roles in global marketing across multiple J&J medical device franchises.Financial:ONWARD reported an operating loss of EUR 32.0M in 2022  compared to EUR 28.6M in 2021.The Company ended the year with net cash of EUR 61.8M (2021: EUR 89.4M).Management reiterated its guidance of a cash runway through the end of 2024.“We expect our current cash to propel operations through the end of 2024  providing us a sound financial base as we grow the Company and prepare for commercial operations in 2023 ” commented Lara Smith Weber  CFO of ONWARD.Full Year Financial Summary:For the twelve-month period ended December 31In EUR millions  except for per-share data 2022 2021 Total Revenues & Other Income 2.1 1.4 Total Operating Expenses (34.2 ) (30.0 ) Operating Loss for the Period (32.0 ) (28.6 ) Net Finance Expense (1.5 ) (5.7 ) Income Tax Expense 0.8 (0.0 ) Net Loss for the Period (32.8 ) (34.3 ) Basic (and diluted) Earnings per Share (in EUR) (1.09 ) (3.62 ) At 31 Dec. 2022 31 Dec. 2021 Net cash at the end of the period 61.8 89.4Total Revenues & Other IncomeOther Income  mainly grant income  increased to EUR 2.1M (2021: EUR 1.4M) following an increase in US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) funding and new grants received from the European Innovation Council (EIC) and SMEs Executive Agency (EISMEA) and Eurostars. The new grants support work on BCIs to reverse upper- and lower-limb paralysis as well as closed-loop control of blood pressure for people with SCI.Total Operating ExpensesTotal Operating expenses increased during 2022 by EUR 4.2M to EUR 34.2M (2021: EUR 30.0M). As part of this  Research & Development expenses increased from EUR 10.6M in 2021 to EUR 13.1M in 2022  driven by advancements made with the ARC-EX and ARC-IM platforms. Additionally  Clinical expenses increased from EUR 4.8M in 2021 to EUR 5.7M in 2022  primarily due to the completion of the Up-LIFT and LIFT Home clinical trials. Marketing and Market Access expenses increased from EUR 1.5M in 2021 to EUR 2.0M in 2022 and include preparations for launch in the US and Europe  as well as attendance at key events to raise awareness of ARC Therapy among key customer groups. General and Administrative expenses were stable  decreasing slightly from EUR 10.7M in 2021 to EUR 10.6M in 2022.Net Finance ExpenseNet Finance expense decreased from EUR 5.7M in 2021 to EUR 1.5M in 2022. The 2021 expense included the interest on the Company’s sources of funding from our innovation loan from Rijksdienst voor Ondernemend (RVO  a Dutch government funding vehicle for entrepreneurial ventures)  our convertible loan (CLA)  and the accrued dividend of preference A shares. Both the CLA and preference A shares converted to ordinary shares in October 2021. The 2022 expense is related to the innovation loan from RVO NL plus bank interest paid on our positive cash balance.Net Loss for the PeriodThe Company realized a Net Loss for the period of EUR 32.8 million vs. EUR 34.3 million in 2021. The decrease is driven by a lower Net Finance expense (see above).Net Cash PositionThe Company ended the year with a net cash position of EUR 61.8M (2021: EUR 89.4M)  comprising of cash and cash equivalents of EUR 41.8M and fixed term deposits of EUR 20.0M. Cash outflow from operating activities increased from EUR 19.9M in 2021 to EUR 26.7M in 2022 due to higher operating costs  partially offset by a decrease in non-cash adjustments (relating to share-based compensation and net finance costs) and a positive change in working capital.OutlookONWARD expects to achieve several important milestones in 2023:The Company plans to submit a de novo application for FDA clearance of its ARC-EX system during 2023  which ONWARD anticipates will result in regulatory authorization to commercialize that platform in the US in late 2023 or early 2024. The Company aims to obtain CE mark and European authorization in early 2024.The Company intends to publish detailed results from its Up-LIFT pivotal study for ARC-EX Therapy.ONWARD expects first-in-human use of its ARC-IM Lead  a purpose-designed lead that is optimized for placement along the spinal cord to stimulate the dorsal roots to restore mobility and autonomic function after SCI.The Company expects first-in-human use of ARC-BCI  its brain-computer interface platform. ONWARD is investigating ARC-BCI as its second-generation implantable platform to enable movement. The BCI platform harvests brain signals and wirelessly transmits a person’s intention to move to the Company’s ARC-IM system to enable more natural movement.ONWARD plans to continue to strengthen its organizational capabilities in preparation for the expected launch of ARC-EX in late 2023 or early 2024  recruiting field sales and service professionals and adding operational systems that will enable the Company to conduct commerce once FDA clearance and CE mark are received for the ARC-EX system. ONWARD will continue to recruit outstanding leaders with global experience and functional expertise who can help to scale effectively and realize the Company’s significant potential as a business.In 2023  ONWARD plans to pursue opportunities to further strengthen its balance sheet and extend its cash runway to support future investments in product development  the conduct of clinical trials  and the addition of operational and commercial capabilities.Conference Call & WebcastONWARD will host a conference call with live webcast on March 28  2023  at 2:00 PM CEST / 08:00 AM EDT.

(Euronext: ONWD)  the medical technology company creating innovative therapies to restore movement  independence  and health in people with spinal cord injury  today announces its 2022 financial and operating results. The full Annual Report is available here   on the Company’s website in the Investors section ( https://ir.onwd.com )  and on the website of the Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets ( www.afm.nl ).“I am proud of the volume and significance of our team’s achievements as we prepare for commercialization of our first therapy in late 2023 or early 2024 ” said Dave Marver  CEO of ONWARD. “We announced positive top-line results from our Up-LIFT pivotal study evaluating the use of our external ARC-EX Therapy to restore upper extremity function after spinal cord injury (SCI) and positive interim outcomes from our studies evaluating the use of our implantable ARC-IM Therapy to better regulate blood pressure after SCI. We also made progress in the development of the ARC-IM system to restore motor function  including the evaluation of our ARC-BCI platform  designed to augment ARC-IM Therapy to enable more natural movement. This first-of-its-kind system adds a brain-computer interface (BCI) that records a person’s intention to move and directs our spinal cord stimulation platform to enable that movement with ARC-IM Therapy.We added impactful talent to our Board of Directors and leadership team over the past 12 months. These new additions will help ONWARD scale and reach its vast potential. We are now implementing the operational and commercial capabilities required to successfully launch our first therapy.We expect several important milestones in 2023  including the first-in-human use of the ARC-IM Lead  the commencement of mobility studies for both SCI and Parkinson’s disease  the first-in-human use of the ARC-BCI platform to restore upper extremity function  the publication of detailed results from our Up-LIFT pivotal study  and regulatory clearance and first commercial sale of the ARC-EX device. It is an exciting time to be at ONWARD  and we are deeply motivated by the imperative to help people with SCI  their caregivers  and others with paralysis and movement disabilities.”The Company’s financial and operating highlights for 2022 and early 2023 include the following:Innovation and Clinical Development:In May 2022  the first participant was enrolled in the HemON feasibility study  a precursor to the Company’s planned pivotal trial  EMPOWER BP  evaluating ARC-IM Therapy to improve blood pressure regulation after SCI. This was also the first human use of the ARC-IM implantable pulse generator (IPG)  a proprietary  purpose-built implantable neurostimulator.In September 2022  ONWARD reported positive top-line results from its pivotal study  Up-LIFT  evaluating ARC-EX Therapy to restore movement after SCI. The study achieved its primary effectiveness endpoint of clinically meaningful improvement in upper extremity strength and function.In October 2022  the Company released data from the LIFT Home observational study  which evaluated the usability of ARC-EX Therapy in the home setting. Approximately 97% of at-home sessions were completed without usability issues  supporting the feasibility of home-based therapy.In December 2022  the Company reported positive interim clinical outcomes from the first ten people treated to better regulate blood pressure with ARC-IM Therapy. The therapy improved blood pressure levels in all study participants  who also reported improved quality of life  increased energy and vitality  and reduced dizziness.During 2022 and early 2023  the Company added five more FDA Breakthrough Device Designation awards (BDD). ONWARD now has eight BDDs  underscoring the innovative nature of its work.Science and Intellectual Property (IP):During 2022  the Company added 24 patents to its IP portfolio  now totaling more than 330 issued and pending patents. ONWARD also obtained option rights to license IP from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL) and Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV)  allowing ONWARD to develop and commercialize a novel brain-computer interface (BCI) platform  called ARC-BCI  that captures brain signals and wirelessly transmits a person’s intention to move to the Company’s ARC-IM platform to enable more natural movement.In November 2022  ONWARD and research partners at EPFL and CEA-Clinatec were awarded a grant from the European Innovation Council (EIC) to further develop ARC-BCI to restore mobility and upper limb function in people with SCI.The Company was also the First Place Winner of the 2022 BCI Award  which was granted to ONWARD and its research partners for their submission  “Walking naturally after spinal cord injury using a brain-spine interface.”Several important articles were published in major scientific journals during 2022. These included: In February 2022  Nature Medicine published results of the STIMO study highlighting the use of ARC-IM Therapy to enable people with even the most severe forms of SCI to stand and walk again; in April 2022  New England Journal of Medicine published the use of ONWARD’s innovative approach to treating orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure) in a patient with MSA-P  a severe form of Parkinson’s disease; in June 2022  Nature Neuroscience published pre-clinical research showing the potential for ONWARD ARC-IM Therapy to restore movement and function in hands and arms after SCI; in November 2022  Nature published pioneering work from ONWARD’s research partners at .NeuroRestore identifying the precise neurons that restore walking after paralysis. This paper also detailed the results from nine participants in the STIMO trial  all of whom could stand and walk with the benefit of ARC-IM Therapy.Corporate:In March 2022  the Company was added to Euronext Brussels’ Bel-Small Index.During 2022 and early 2023  several seasoned professionals joined ONWARD  each with the talent and experience to help the Company scale and reach its full potential: Kristina Dziekan and Vivian Riefberg were added to the Board of Directors.

Paris  27 March 2023  Quadient S.A. (Euronext Paris: QDT)  a leader in business solutions for meaningful customer connections through digital and physical channels  announces today its 2022 fourth-quarter consolidated sales and full-year results (period ended on 31 January 2023). The full-year 2022 results were approved by the Board of Directors during a meeting held on Friday 24 March 2023. Geoffrey Godet  Chief Executive Officer of Quadient S.A.  stated: “As we continue to make progress in the execution of our Back to Growth strategy  this year’s results benefited from a strong finish  demonstrating Quadient’s ability to reposition itself on core markets and geographies  adapt its business to a recurring subscription model while investing in solutions recognized for their leadership. This year  we posted a moderate but positive annual organic revenue growth  with a particularly robust Q4 across all solutions  while the operating profitability showed a marked improvement in H2 vs H1. Our cloud Software Solution performed strongly with a more than 20% record organic growth in Annual Recurring Revenue  driving double-digit organic growth in subscription-related revenue. With the transition from license sales to SaaS subscription nearly completed  this revenue growth is now reflected in an improving profitability trend  as already seen in the second part of the year. Mail-Related Solutions achieved a stunning performance in posting organic growth for the second consecutive year  while succeeding to maintain a high level of profitability. In addition  Mail-Related Solutions delivered strong hardware sales levels and benefitted from record cross sell between Quadient’s mailing equipment customers and its Software Solutions. Finally  Parcel Locker Solutions showed attractive growth in our European geographies while the overall performance was impacted by a high comparison basis in Q1 as well as delays in retail and residential projects in the US. Two years into the second phase of our strategic plan  we have reached a turning point in the evolution of the Group with the divestments of the remaining non-core activities  leading to the end of the Additional Operations segment and the simplification of our financial reporting. We continue to leverage our unique state-of-the-art software and smart hardware platform to drive the synergistic development of the entire Group and achieve our medium-term ambitions. Our integrated and subscription-based business model is proving very resilient in the current macro context and our ability to cross-sell and upsell our comprehensive product range to our more than 440 000 enterprises and SMB customers makes the Group uniquely positioned to continue to grow its top line while also delivering improved profitability.” A SOLID Q4 PERFORMANCE DRIVES 1.4% ORGANIC REVENUE GROWTH IN FY 2022 Group sales stood at €1 081 million in FY 2022  a 1.4% organic growth compared to FY 2021 and a 5.6% increase on a reported basis. The variation includes a positive currency impact of +6.2% or €64 million and a negative scope effect of (2.1)% or €(21) million. The changes of scope are related to the acquisition of Beanworks in March 2021  the divestment of Automated Packaging Systems in July 2021 as well as the more recent divestments of the Graphic activities in the Nordics and the Shipping business in France (both in June 2022). Segment reporting evolution and accounting changesThe sale of the Graphics activities in the Nordics and of the Shipping business in France have completed the reshaping of the Additional Operations portfolio. The remaining activities in the Additional Operations segment were mostly related to Mail-Related Solutions and Parcel Locker Solutions activities in non-core geographies  which are now being integrated into the existing Solutions activities starting at the FY 2022 reporting. The end of the Additional Operations segment has led the Group to re-organise its segment reporting based on an approach by Solution rather than the prior approach by geographies. Consequently  the Group will now provide  in addition to the revenue by Solution  the associated current EBIT(2). Details of the new reporting segments are being provided starting in FY 2022 and a pro forma FY 2021 is also shown for comparison basis. Aside from the simplification effort in segment reporting  the FY 2022 current EBIT2  both at the Group and at Solution levels  was impacted by the new IFRIC accounting standard on Cloud Software investments. At Group level  the FY 2022 negative impact on current EBIT2 was €(5) million.

Subscription-related revenue continues to grow at a double-digit rate closing the year on an 18.5% organic growth. Q4 marked a further acceleration of the organic growth trend reaching 22.1% for the quarter. Record year for cross selling software modules to Mail-Related Solutions customers and several large subscription deals (>€1 million/year each) signed in 2022 have both contributed to this solid performance. It is also worth highlighting the fast organic increase in revenues delivered by Quadient’s Account Receivables and Account Payables modules growing at over 50% for the FY 2022. Overall  demand for Quadient’s cloud-based offering has remained strong throughout FY 2022 with each quarter of the year posting a double-digit organic increase in subscription-related revenue  which now accounts for 75% of Intelligent Communication Automation total sales in 2022 compared to only 67% in FY 2021. The share of SaaS customers reached 80% at the end of FY 2022  a further increase compared to 76% in FY 2021  also highlighting the progress made in the change in business model from license sales to a cloud-based offer. Annual recurring revenue set a new record  reaching €187 million at the end of FY 2022  up from €145 million at the end of FY 2021  representing a 22% organic increase7. Annual recurring revenue is a forward-looking indicator of future subscription-related organic growth  which is expected to further accelerate in FY 2023. With the strong increase in Subscription-related revenue  the weight of license sales continues to decrease  now only representing 8% of total Solution sales. License sales decreased by 37.6% organically in FY 2022 bringing the transformation of the business model close to completion. The negative impact of this transition on the Solution growth should therefore be more limited going forward. Professional services were slightly down organically  by 5.4%  professional services revenue being directly linked to the evolution in product mix. Current EBIT2 for Intelligent Communication Automation was negative at €(10) million  leading to an EBIT margin2 of (4.5)%. The operating profitability of Intelligent Communication Automation was mainly impacted in the first half of the year by the high inflation weighing on personnel costs  a return to normalised marketing expenses post-Covid and additional costs linked to the launch of new modules in selected European countries. The second half of the year showed a marked improvement in current EBIT2 with an EBIT margin moving from (9.7)% in H1 to 0.2% in H2 thanks to the increase in revenue and in gross margin as well as to a tight cost control  lower impact from salary inflation and reduced travel expenses. Furthermore  the on-going change in business model continues to impact the Solution profitability  whereas H1 2022 was also impacted by a high comparison basis due to a large license deal signed in Q2 2021. Current EBIT2 for the Solution is expected to improve in FY 2023 driven by the rising profitability of the installed base  the contribution from the phasing of the prices increases and the contribution from the growing revenue. In addition  the negative impact from the change in business model should continue to decline thanks to the lower weight of license sales in the revenue mix. Mail-Related Solutions Mail-Related Solutions sales reached €757 million in FY 2022  up 6.8% on a reported basis and slightly up organically (+0.1%). Revenue from Mail-Related Solutions now includes former Additional Operations Mail activities in non-core geographies for €51m. This is the second consecutive year of organic increase  a remarkable performance for Mail-Related Solutions as it comes against a high comparison basis (a 1.8% organic growth in the FY 2021) and while the second half of the year was impacted by supply chain disruption. Looking at the geographic contributions  this outstanding performance was mostly driven by organic growth from North America (both subscription-related revenue and license & hardware sales)  while the Main European countries showed contrasted contributions. The solid performance in hardware sales also continued with a 4.3% organic increase in FY 2022  fuelled by a very strong Q4 at +9.1% organic growth. Quadient’s strategy to renew its product offering is bearing fruits with an increasing penetration of the new generation of products. The share of the upgraded installed base is reaching 19.9% at the end of FY 2022  vs 11.7% at the end of FY 2021. Placement of remanufactured mailing equipment is also gathering pace with the remanufacturing level reaching 73% at the end of the year  well ahead of the 50% level targeted by the Group for 2023. Subscription-related revenues (69% of Mail-Related Solutions sales) recorded a limited 1.7% decline in FY 2022. This solid performance is driven by both the resilience of the installed base and the multi-year largely indexed contracts. Current EBIT2 for Mail-Related Solutions was €186 million for FY 2022 including a c.€(3) million negative impact from the new IFRIC accounting standard for cloud computing. Current EBIT margin for FY 2022 was 24.5%. The high profitability level of Mail-Related Solutions is even more remarkable given the high inflationary environment as well as still high freight costs. Record cross-selling of Intelligent Communication Software leading to increased costs synergies  strong focus on costs control  continuous increase in remanufacturing placements and the benefit from the indexation have all contributed to this solid performance. Current EBIT2 for the Solution is expected to remain solid in FY 2023 supported by a tight focus on cost control  a positive outlook in North America and further penetration of new generation mail equipment. Parcel Locker Solutions Parcel Locker Solutions sales increased by 5.6% to €91 million in FY 2022  a 0.4% organic increase compared to FY 2021. FY 2022 revenue includes Lockers activities in non-core geographies from the former Additional Operations segment for €4 million. License and hardware sales were down 12.6% organically in FY 2022 impacted  on the one hand  by an unfavourable comparison basis linked to the final phase of the deployment of a large North American retail contract in Q1 2021  and  on the other hand  by the delays in retail and residential projects in the US. Subscription-related revenues were up 10.0% organically supported by the deployment of existing contracts  solid usage rate (standing at 64% at the end of FY 2022) and the benefits from price increases on the installed base. Subscription-related revenue stands at 59% of total revenue for Parcel Locker Solutions. The deployment of a new open network of lockers in the UK  launched in June 2022  is gathering momentum. DPD  DHL and Evri have all officially announced that they will use the network for the delivery of their volumes  while a fourth carrier has recently also joined the network. The targeted number of installed lockers is set at 5 000  to be deployed in the coming years. Quadient’s global installed locker base reached 18 000+ units at the end of FY 2022. Current EBIT2 for Parcel Locker Solutions was negative at €(25) million in 2022  with a current EBIT margin of (27.8)%. Current EBIT margin for the existing installed base was 12.5% vs 11.3% a year ago. Profitability in 2022 has been impacted by several one-off factors  namely: i) Increased costs associated with the development and the launch of new products  ii) Go-to-market and initial deployment costs associated with the new UK open-network  and iii) Delays in retail deals and residential installations in the US.Profitability is expected to increase in FY 2023 supported by declining freight costs  lower costs associated with product launches and the UK open network as well as the rising profitability of the installed base and benefits from the phasing of price increases.

Sales in North America (55% of Group sales) were up 3.0% organically to €599 million and 15.4% on a reported basis. Solid hardware sales for Mail-Related Solutions as well as a strong performance from Intelligent Communication Automation were the main contributors to the growth in the region. Penetration of Quadient’s cloud-based solutions continues to be well supported by successful cross-selling with two-thirds of new Software customers coming from the Mail customer base. Quadient’s Account Receivables and Account Payables solutions also performed well in the region contributing to the overall solid performance for the year. Parcel Locker Solutions  however  suffered from both delays in the deployment of retail and residential projects and from a high comparison basis with the completion of the roll-out of a large retail contract in Q1 2021. Main European countries (34% of Group sales) were marginally down by 1.4% on an organic basis to €372 million. Performance has been contrasted by countries and by Solution in this region. Mail-Related Solutions performed well in terms of hardware sales in most European countries except for France. For Intelligent Communication Automation  penetration of the recently launched Account Receivables and Account Payables modules have started to contribute to the growth in the region but the decline in license sales due to the change in business model continues to impact the overall growth. Parcel Locker Solutions was the main contributor to growth in the region (+c.50% on an organic basis)  benefiting from the on-going deployment of the recently signed contracts most notably in France. The International segment (10% of Group sales) delivered a 3.6% organic growth  to €110 million  mostly driven by the good dynamics of both Intelligent Communication Automation and Parcel Locker Solutions. Q4 2022 SALES Consolidated sales stood at €288 million in the fourth quarter of 2022  up 5.5% on a reported basis and 3.1% on an organic basis compared to the fourth quarter of 2021.

REVIEW OF 2022 FULL-YEAR RESULTS Simplified P&L In € million FY 2022(including IFRIC) FY 2021(No IFRIC impact) Change Sales 1 081 1 024 +5.6% Gross profit 790 744 +6.2% Gross margin 73.1% 72.6% EBITDA 240 245 (2.0)% EBITDA margin 22.2% 23.9% Current operating income before acquisition-related expenses 150 147 +2.2% Current operating income margin (before acquisition related expenses) 13.9% 14.3% Current operating income 140 135 +3.5% Optimization expenses and other operating income & expenses (73) (19) n.m. Operating income 67 116 (42.6)% Financial income/(expense) (36) (8) n.m. Net attributable income 13 88 (84.9)% Earnings per share 0.29 2.32 Diluted earnings per share 0.29 2.17 Gross margin improved to 73.1% in FY 2022 compared to 72.6% in FY 2021. A solid performance achieved in difficult conditions with the high inflation level impacting all costs aspects and freight costs still at elevated levels. Tight cost control as well as the positive business development and price increases all contributed to this improvement in gross margin. Current operating income before acquisition-related expenses increased to €150 million in FY 2022 compared to €147 million in FY 2021  up 2.2% on a reported basis and down 4.8% on an organic3 basis. The current operating income before acquisition-related expenses includes a €5 million negative impact from the new IFRIC rule for cloud computing. Current operating margin before acquisition-related expenses stood at 13.9% of sales in 2022 compared to 14.3% in 2021. Excluding the negative IFRIC impact  the current operating margin before acquisition-related expenses would have been stable year over year at 14.3%. The Group’s operating profitability was impacted by higher personnel costs  increased R&D  and go-to-market spendings. Investments into scaling the network of parcel lockers with the launch of the UK open network also weighed on profitability as well as the recent delays in retail and residential lockers projects in the US. Price increases through the year  the benefit of indexation for part of the Group’s installed base as well as tight cost control helped mitigate these negative elements. As anticipated  H2 current EBIT margin showed a marked improvement versus H1 2022 level  at 16.1% excluding IFRIC vs 12.5%. The solid H2 performance was driven by all three Solutions with notably Intelligent Communication Automation showing strong recovery while Mail-Related Solutions managed to further improve an already high level of profitability. With no significant M&A activities in FY 2022  acquisition-related expenses declined slightly to €10 million in FY 2022  compared to €12 million in 2021. Consequently  current operating income stood at €140 million in 2022 including the negative IFRIC impact  compared to €135 million in FY 2021. Optimization costs and other operating expenses stood at €73 million in FY 2022  versus €19 million in FY 2021. In particular  this included: i) Goodwill impairment for €48 million  resulting from the WACC increase in UK  Ireland and DACHIT regions and tax rate increase in the UK ii) Real estate write-offs linked to the optimisation of the office footprint for a total amount of €16 million Including these non-current items  operating income for FY 2022 was €67 million  versus €116 million recorded in FY 2021. Net attributable income 2022 net cost of debt was marginally up year-on-year at €27 million  against €25 million in FY 2021. The increase is mainly due to the refinancing of the ODIRNANE instrument  which was booked in equity  through the emission of Schuldschein debt in November 2021. The currency gains & losses and other financial items were a loss of €9 million in 2022 versus a gain of €17 million in FY 2021. This is partly due to a decrease of €5 million in the fair value of the investment made by Quadient in private equity funds X’Ange 2 and Partech Entrepreneurs while  in FY 2021  currency gains and other financial items benefited from the €20 million increase in the fair value of these investments. Overall  net financial result was a loss of €36 million in FY 2022 compared to a loss of €8 million in FY 2021. Income tax decreased to €16 million in FY 2022 versus €20 million in FY 2021. This is mainly due to the favourable impact of a tax loss carry forward recognition  partly offset by an increase in the tax charge in the United States. The corporate tax rate stood at 54.8% in FY 2022 compared to 18.1% in FY 2021. This high rate is mainly owing to the impairment of goodwill recorded this year. Restated for this item  the corporate tax rate would be 21.4% and marks a return to a more normal level. Net attributable income after minority interest amounted to €13 million in FY 2022 compared to €88 million in FY 2021. Earnings per share8 stood at €0.29 in FY 2022 compared to €2.32 in FY 2021. Proposed dividend at €0.60 per share for the FY 2022  a 9% increase against the FY 2021 dividend. The dividend is subject to approval by the Annual General Meeting  scheduled for 16 June 2023  and will be paid in cash in one instalment on 7 August 2023. Cash flow generation EBITDA9F9 was €240 million in FY 2022 compared to €245 million in FY 2021. EBITDA margin decreased from 23.9% in FY 2021 to 22.2% in FY 2022. Excluding the negative IFRIC impact  EBITDA margin for the FY 2022 would have been 22.7%. The decline in EBITDA margin was mainly due to increased go to market efforts to support the Group’s growth engines  product launches in new geographies as well as the impact from salary inflation. The change in working capital was negative by €38 million in FY 2022 compared to a net cash outflow of €8 million in FY 2021. The degradation in working capital was primarily driven by the higher level of inventories at the end of the year due to both supply chain disruptions for the Mail business and delays in retail and residential projects for the Parcel Locker Solutions. The slower collection of receivables compared to the exceptional level in FY 2021 (catch up impact post Covid-19 crisis) also impacted the working capital. Lease receivables recorded a remarkable small decrease of only €8 million in FY 2022 compared to a decrease of €39 million in FY 2021. This extremely solid performance has been achieved thanks to the high level of hardware placement for Mail-Related Solutions  which in turns slows the decline of the leasing portfolio. The leasing portfolio and other financing services is stable at €595 million as of 31 January 2023  the same level as of 31 January 2022 helped by a positive currency impact. On an organic basis  this represents a slower decrease of 1.4% at the end of FY 2022 compared to a decrease 6.4% at the end of FY 2021. At the end of FY 2022  the default rate of the leasing portfolio stood at around 1.6% compared to 1.7% at the end of FY 2021. Interest and taxes paid decreased significantly to €35 million in FY 2022 versus €66 million in FY 2021. The lower amount paid in 2022 is mostly explained by the reimbursement of the 2020 tax loss carry-back measures in the US. Capital expenditure remained stable in 2022 at €88 million. Development capex was also stable at €36 million in 2022 (vs. €37 million in FY 2021) and was mostly spent on R&D investments for software developments and Parcel lockers innovations. Rented equipment capex was slightly up year-over-year at €30 million in FY 2022  compared to €29 million in FY 2021  thanks to the sustained level of Mail-Related Solutions hardware placements  the on-going deployment of Parcel Locker Solutions contracts in France and Japan as well as the start of the installation of the new UK open network. The small increase in maintenance capex  to €13 million  was mostly linked to software projects and IT equipment spendings. To be noted  while previously capitalised  cloud computing investments are now expensed or moved to prepaid expenses in line with the new IFRIC accounting standard for an amount of €8 million. Consequently  cash flow after capital expenditure for the year was down to €70 million in FY 2022 compared to €104 million in FY 2021. LEVERAGE AND LIQUIDITY POSITION Net debt stood at €722 million as of 31 January 2023  an increase against the €504 million of net financial debt recorded as of 31 January 2022 but this represents a significant decrease versus the €769 million  comprising the 2021 net financial debt plus the €265 million ODIRNANE facility accounted for as equity. Therefore  the overall financial structure for the Group has improved significantly in FY 2022 despite the increase in debt level which is due to the repayment in full of the ODIRNANE instrument in June 2022. The ODIRNANE was repaid following the successful issuance of a €270 Schuldschein emission in November 2021. The Group has no significant debt maturity before its €325 million 2.25% bond maturing in 2025. The leverage ratio (net debt/EBITDA) improved slightly to 3.0x5 as of 31 January 2023 versus 3.1x5 as of 31 January 2022 (adjusted for the ODIRNANE). Excluding leasing and adjusted for the ODIRNANE  the leverage ratio also improved to 1.8x5 as of 31 January 2023 vs 2.0x5 at the end of FY 2021 (31 January 2022). The Group remains focused on reaching its leverage ratio target of 1.75x5 excluding leasing as of 31 January 2024. As of 31 January 2023  the Group had a robust liquidity position of €572 million  split between €172 million in cash and a €400 million undrawn credit line  the latter maturing in 2024. Shareholders’ equity stood at € 1 082 million as of 31 January 2023 compared to €1 359 million as of 31 January 2022. The gearing ratio121010 went up to 66.7% as of 31 January 2023 from 37.1% as of 31 January 2022 due to the mechanical impact from the ODIRNANE reimbursement (double impact from lower equities and higher debt). OUTLOOK FY 2023 guidance allows to confirm the 2021-2023 financial outlook Revenue guidance Sales outlook is confirmed at minimum 3% organic sales CAGR over 2021-23FY 2023 organic sales growth is expected c.3%. Current EBIT2 guidance Current EBIT 2 outlook is confirmed at minimum mid-single digit organic 6 current EBIT 2 CAGR over 2021-23outlook is confirmed at minimum mid-single digit organic current EBIT CAGR over 2021-23 FY 2023 organic growth in current EBIT2 is expected at c.10%. In terms of the organic revenue growth  FY 2023 is expected to benefit from the positive trend in Annual Recurring Revenue for Intelligent Communication Automation  which grew at +22% organically in FY 2022 and is expected to translate into a similar level of subscription-related revenue growth in FY 2023. In addition  solid cross-selling and upselling dynamics should also continue to drive growth in future bookings. As the weight of licenses sales continues to decrease  growth for Intelligent Communication Automation is expected to gradually move closer to the subscription-related revenue growth. After two remarkable years of organic growth for Mail-Related Solutions  driven by solid hardware placements and some benefits from price increases  the outlook for FY 2023 is cautiously optimistic thanks to further benefits from price increases and further upgrade of the installed base. Parcel Locker Solutions should deliver strong organic growth in FY 2023 supported by the rising contribution of the larger installed base as well as some catch up in installations in the US following the delays recorded in FY 2022 in the residential and retail sectors. Turning to the current EBIT2  the improvement in profitability is expected to be driven by: i) The rising profitability of the installed base for both the SaaS activity and parcel lockers  ii) Continued improvement in current EBIT(1) for Intelligent Communication Automation as the transition to SaaS is almost completed  significant increase in current EBIT2 expected for Parcel Locker Solutions driven by acceleration of locker placements  whilst Mail-Related Solutions current EBIT2 margin should remain high thanks to careful price control  and iii) Lower freight costs.However  salary inflation is expected to continue.

Paris  27 March 2023  Quadient S.A. (Euronext Paris: QDT)  a leader in business solutions for meaningful customer connections through digital and physical channels  announces today its 2022 fourth-quarter consolidated sales and full-year results (period ended on 31 January 2023). The full-year 2022 results were approved by the Board of Directors during a meeting held on Friday 24 March 2023. Geoffrey Godet  Chief Executive Officer of Quadient S.A.  stated: “As we continue to make progress in the execution of our Back to Growth strategy  this year’s results benefited from a strong finish  demonstrating Quadient’s ability to reposition itself on core markets and geographies  adapt its business to a recurring subscription model while investing in solutions recognized for their leadership. This year  we posted a moderate but positive annual organic revenue growth  with a particularly robust Q4 across all solutions  while the operating profitability showed a marked improvement in H2 vs H1. Our cloud Software Solution performed strongly with a more than 20% record organic growth in Annual Recurring Revenue  driving double-digit organic growth in subscription-related revenue. With the transition from license sales to SaaS subscription nearly completed  this revenue growth is now reflected in an improving profitability trend  as already seen in the second part of the year. Mail-Related Solutions achieved a stunning performance in posting organic growth for the second consecutive year  while succeeding to maintain a high level of profitability. In addition  Mail-Related Solutions delivered strong hardware sales levels and benefitted from record cross sell between Quadient’s mailing equipment customers and its Software Solutions. Finally  Parcel Locker Solutions showed attractive growth in our European geographies while the overall performance was impacted by a high comparison basis in Q1 as well as delays in retail and residential projects in the US. Two years into the second phase of our strategic plan  we have reached a turning point in the evolution of the Group with the divestments of the remaining non-core activities  leading to the end of the Additional Operations segment and the simplification of our financial reporting. We continue to leverage our unique state-of-the-art software and smart hardware platform to drive the synergistic development of the entire Group and achieve our medium-term ambitions. Our integrated and subscription-based business model is proving very resilient in the current macro context and our ability to cross-sell and upsell our comprehensive product range to our more than 440 000 enterprises and SMB customers makes the Group uniquely positioned to continue to grow its top line while also delivering improved profitability.” A SOLID Q4 PERFORMANCE DRIVES 1.4% ORGANIC REVENUE GROWTH IN FY 2022 Group sales stood at €1 081 million in FY 2022  a 1.4% organic growth compared to FY 2021 and a 5.6% increase on a reported basis. The variation includes a positive currency impact of +6.2% or €64 million and a negative scope effect of (2.1)% or €(21) million. The changes of scope are related to the acquisition of Beanworks in March 2021  the divestment of Automated Packaging Systems in July 2021 as well as the more recent divestments of the Graphic activities in the Nordics and the Shipping business in France (both in June 2022). Segment reporting evolution and accounting changesThe sale of the Graphics activities in the Nordics and of the Shipping business in France have completed the reshaping of the Additional Operations portfolio. The remaining activities in the Additional Operations segment were mostly related to Mail-Related Solutions and Parcel Locker Solutions activities in non-core geographies  which are now being integrated into the existing Solutions activities starting at the FY 2022 reporting. The end of the Additional Operations segment has led the Group to re-organise its segment reporting based on an approach by Solution rather than the prior approach by geographies. Consequently  the Group will now provide  in addition to the revenue by Solution  the associated current EBIT(2). Details of the new reporting segments are being provided starting in FY 2022 and a pro forma FY 2021 is also shown for comparison basis. Aside from the simplification effort in segment reporting  the FY 2022 current EBIT2  both at the Group and at Solution levels  was impacted by the new IFRIC accounting standard on Cloud Software investments. At Group level  the FY 2022 negative impact on current EBIT2 was €(5) million.

Subscription-related revenue continues to grow at a double-digit rate closing the year on an 18.5% organic growth. Q4 marked a further acceleration of the organic growth trend reaching 22.1% for the quarter. Record year for cross selling software modules to Mail-Related Solutions customers and several large subscription deals (>€1 million/year each) signed in 2022 have both contributed to this solid performance. It is also worth highlighting the fast organic increase in revenues delivered by Quadient’s Account Receivables and Account Payables modules growing at over 50% for the FY 2022. Overall  demand for Quadient’s cloud-based offering has remained strong throughout FY 2022 with each quarter of the year posting a double-digit organic increase in subscription-related revenue  which now accounts for 75% of Intelligent Communication Automation total sales in 2022 compared to only 67% in FY 2021. The share of SaaS customers reached 80% at the end of FY 2022  a further increase compared to 76% in FY 2021  also highlighting the progress made in the change in business model from license sales to a cloud-based offer. Annual recurring revenue set a new record  reaching €187 million at the end of FY 2022  up from €145 million at the end of FY 2021  representing a 22% organic increase7. Annual recurring revenue is a forward-looking indicator of future subscription-related organic growth  which is expected to further accelerate in FY 2023. With the strong increase in Subscription-related revenue  the weight of license sales continues to decrease  now only representing 8% of total Solution sales. License sales decreased by 37.6% organically in FY 2022 bringing the transformation of the business model close to completion. The negative impact of this transition on the Solution growth should therefore be more limited going forward. Professional services were slightly down organically  by 5.4%  professional services revenue being directly linked to the evolution in product mix. Current EBIT2 for Intelligent Communication Automation was negative at €(10) million  leading to an EBIT margin2 of (4.5)%. The operating profitability of Intelligent Communication Automation was mainly impacted in the first half of the year by the high inflation weighing on personnel costs  a return to normalised marketing expenses post-Covid and additional costs linked to the launch of new modules in selected European countries. The second half of the year showed a marked improvement in current EBIT2 with an EBIT margin moving from (9.7)% in H1 to 0.2% in H2 thanks to the increase in revenue and in gross margin as well as to a tight cost control  lower impact from salary inflation and reduced travel expenses. Furthermore  the on-going change in business model continues to impact the Solution profitability  whereas H1 2022 was also impacted by a high comparison basis due to a large license deal signed in Q2 2021. Current EBIT2 for the Solution is expected to improve in FY 2023 driven by the rising profitability of the installed base  the contribution from the phasing of the prices increases and the contribution from the growing revenue. In addition  the negative impact from the change in business model should continue to decline thanks to the lower weight of license sales in the revenue mix. Mail-Related Solutions Mail-Related Solutions sales reached €757 million in FY 2022  up 6.8% on a reported basis and slightly up organically (+0.1%). Revenue from Mail-Related Solutions now includes former Additional Operations Mail activities in non-core geographies for €51m. This is the second consecutive year of organic increase  a remarkable performance for Mail-Related Solutions as it comes against a high comparison basis (a 1.8% organic growth in the FY 2021) and while the second half of the year was impacted by supply chain disruption. Looking at the geographic contributions  this outstanding performance was mostly driven by organic growth from North America (both subscription-related revenue and license & hardware sales)  while the Main European countries showed contrasted contributions. The solid performance in hardware sales also continued with a 4.3% organic increase in FY 2022  fuelled by a very strong Q4 at +9.1% organic growth. Quadient’s strategy to renew its product offering is bearing fruits with an increasing penetration of the new generation of products. The share of the upgraded installed base is reaching 19.9% at the end of FY 2022  vs 11.7% at the end of FY 2021. Placement of remanufactured mailing equipment is also gathering pace with the remanufacturing level reaching 73% at the end of the year  well ahead of the 50% level targeted by the Group for 2023. Subscription-related revenues (69% of Mail-Related Solutions sales) recorded a limited 1.7% decline in FY 2022. This solid performance is driven by both the resilience of the installed base and the multi-year largely indexed contracts. Current EBIT2 for Mail-Related Solutions was €186 million for FY 2022 including a c.€(3) million negative impact from the new IFRIC accounting standard for cloud computing. Current EBIT margin for FY 2022 was 24.5%. The high profitability level of Mail-Related Solutions is even more remarkable given the high inflationary environment as well as still high freight costs. Record cross-selling of Intelligent Communication Software leading to increased costs synergies  strong focus on costs control  continuous increase in remanufacturing placements and the benefit from the indexation have all contributed to this solid performance. Current EBIT2 for the Solution is expected to remain solid in FY 2023 supported by a tight focus on cost control  a positive outlook in North America and further penetration of new generation mail equipment. Parcel Locker Solutions Parcel Locker Solutions sales increased by 5.6% to €91 million in FY 2022  a 0.4% organic increase compared to FY 2021. FY 2022 revenue includes Lockers activities in non-core geographies from the former Additional Operations segment for €4 million. License and hardware sales were down 12.6% organically in FY 2022 impacted  on the one hand  by an unfavourable comparison basis linked to the final phase of the deployment of a large North American retail contract in Q1 2021  and  on the other hand  by the delays in retail and residential projects in the US. Subscription-related revenues were up 10.0% organically supported by the deployment of existing contracts  solid usage rate (standing at 64% at the end of FY 2022) and the benefits from price increases on the installed base. Subscription-related revenue stands at 59% of total revenue for Parcel Locker Solutions. The deployment of a new open network of lockers in the UK  launched in June 2022  is gathering momentum. DPD  DHL and Evri have all officially announced that they will use the network for the delivery of their volumes  while a fourth carrier has recently also joined the network. The targeted number of installed lockers is set at 5 000  to be deployed in the coming years. Quadient’s global installed locker base reached 18 000+ units at the end of FY 2022. Current EBIT2 for Parcel Locker Solutions was negative at €(25) million in 2022  with a current EBIT margin of (27.8)%. Current EBIT margin for the existing installed base was 12.5% vs 11.3% a year ago. Profitability in 2022 has been impacted by several one-off factors  namely: i) Increased costs associated with the development and the launch of new products  ii) Go-to-market and initial deployment costs associated with the new UK open-network  and iii) Delays in retail deals and residential installations in the US.Profitability is expected to increase in FY 2023 supported by declining freight costs  lower costs associated with product launches and the UK open network as well as the rising profitability of the installed base and benefits from the phasing of price increases.

Sales in North America (55% of Group sales) were up 3.0% organically to €599 million and 15.4% on a reported basis. Solid hardware sales for Mail-Related Solutions as well as a strong performance from Intelligent Communication Automation were the main contributors to the growth in the region. Penetration of Quadient’s cloud-based solutions continues to be well supported by successful cross-selling with two-thirds of new Software customers coming from the Mail customer base. Quadient’s Account Receivables and Account Payables solutions also performed well in the region contributing to the overall solid performance for the year. Parcel Locker Solutions  however  suffered from both delays in the deployment of retail and residential projects and from a high comparison basis with the completion of the roll-out of a large retail contract in Q1 2021. Main European countries (34% of Group sales) were marginally down by 1.4% on an organic basis to €372 million. Performance has been contrasted by countries and by Solution in this region. Mail-Related Solutions performed well in terms of hardware sales in most European countries except for France. For Intelligent Communication Automation  penetration of the recently launched Account Receivables and Account Payables modules have started to contribute to the growth in the region but the decline in license sales due to the change in business model continues to impact the overall growth. Parcel Locker Solutions was the main contributor to growth in the region (+c.50% on an organic basis)  benefiting from the on-going deployment of the recently signed contracts most notably in France. The International segment (10% of Group sales) delivered a 3.6% organic growth  to €110 million  mostly driven by the good dynamics of both Intelligent Communication Automation and Parcel Locker Solutions. Q4 2022 SALES Consolidated sales stood at €288 million in the fourth quarter of 2022  up 5.5% on a reported basis and 3.1% on an organic basis compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. A solid performance driven by all three Solutions and all geographies  demonstrating an acceleration of the revenue growth trend through the year.

Mail-Related Solutions sales continued to show strong resilience  reaching €202 million  up by 0.9% on an organic basis benefiting from the reduction of the backlog despite further supply chain issues. Parcel Locker Solutions sales stood at €25 million in Q4 2022  with a +7.5% organic growth compared to Q4 2021 thanks to the ongoing deployment of existing contracts in France and the UK.

A solid performance achieved in difficult conditions with the high inflation level impacting all costs aspects and freight costs still at elevated levels. Tight cost control as well as the positive business development and price increases all contributed to this improvement in gross margin. Current operating income before acquisition-related expenses increased to €150 million in FY 2022 compared to €147 million in FY 2021  up 2.2% on a reported basis and down 4.8% on an organic3 basis. The current operating income before acquisition-related expenses includes a €5 million negative impact from the new IFRIC rule for cloud computing. Current operating margin before acquisition-related expenses stood at 13.9% of sales in 2022 compared to 14.3% in 2021. Excluding the negative IFRIC impact  the current operating margin before acquisition-related expenses would have been stable year over year at 14.3%. The Group’s operating profitability was impacted by higher personnel costs  increased R&D  and go-to-market spendings. Investments into scaling the network of parcel lockers with the launch of the UK open network also weighed on profitability as well as the recent delays in retail and residential lockers projects in the US. Price increases through the year  the benefit of indexation for part of the Group’s installed base as well as tight cost control helped mitigate these negative elements. As anticipated  H2 current EBIT margin showed a marked improvement versus H1 2022 level  at 16.1% excluding IFRIC vs 12.5%. The solid H2 performance was driven by all three Solutions with notably Intelligent Communication Automation showing strong recovery while Mail-Related Solutions managed to further improve an already high level of profitability. With no significant M&A activities in FY 2022  acquisition-related expenses declined slightly to €10 million in FY 2022  compared to €12 million in 2021. Consequently  current operating income stood at €140 million in 2022 including the negative IFRIC impact  compared to €135 million in FY 2021. Optimization costs and other operating expenses stood at €73 million in FY 2022  versus €19 million in FY 2021. In particular  this included: i) Goodwill impairment for €48 million  resulting from the WACC increase in UK  Ireland and DACHIT regions and tax rate increase in the UK ii) Real estate write-offs linked to the optimisation of the office footprint for a total amount of €16 million Including these non-current items  operating income for FY 2022 was €67 million  versus €116 million recorded in FY 2021. Net attributable income 2022 net cost of debt was marginally up year-on-year at €27 million  against €25 million in FY 2021. The increase is mainly due to the refinancing of the ODIRNANE instrument  which was booked in equity  through the emission of Schuldschein debt in November 2021. The currency gains & losses and other financial items were a loss of €9 million in 2022 versus a gain of €17 million in FY 2021. This is partly due to a decrease of €5 million in the fair value of the investment made by Quadient in private equity funds X’Ange 2 and Partech Entrepreneurs while  in FY 2021  currency gains and other financial items benefited from the €20 million increase in the fair value of these investments. Overall  net financial result was a loss of €36 million in FY 2022 compared to a loss of €8 million in FY 2021. Income tax decreased to €16 million in FY 2022 versus €20 million in FY 2021. This is mainly due to the favourable impact of a tax loss carry forward recognition  partly offset by an increase in the tax charge in the United States. The corporate tax rate stood at 54.8% in FY 2022 compared to 18.1% in FY 2021. This high rate is mainly owing to the impairment of goodwill recorded this year. Restated for this item  the corporate tax rate would be 21.4% and marks a return to a more normal level. Net attributable income after minority interest amounted to €13 million in FY 2022 compared to €88 million in FY 2021. Earnings per share8 stood at €0.29 in FY 2022 compared to €2.32 in FY 2021. Proposed dividend at €0.60 per share for the FY 2022  a 9% increase against the FY 2021 dividend. The dividend is subject to approval by the Annual General Meeting  scheduled for 16 June 2023  and will be paid in cash in one instalment on 7 August 2023. Cash flow generation EBITDA9F9 was €240 million in FY 2022 compared to €245 million in FY 2021. EBITDA margin decreased from 23.9% in FY 2021 to 22.2% in FY 2022. Excluding the negative IFRIC impact  EBITDA margin for the FY 2022 would have been 22.7%. The decline in EBITDA margin was mainly due to increased go to market efforts to support the Group’s growth engines  product launches in new geographies as well as the impact from salary inflation. The change in working capital was negative by €38 million in FY 2022 compared to a net cash outflow of €8 million in FY 2021. The degradation in working capital was primarily driven by the higher level of inventories at the end of the year due to both supply chain disruptions for the Mail business and delays in retail and residential projects for the Parcel Locker Solutions. The slower collection of receivables compared to the exceptional level in FY 2021 (catch up impact post Covid-19 crisis) also impacted the working capital. Lease receivables recorded a remarkable small decrease of only €8 million in FY 2022 compared to a decrease of €39 million in FY 2021. This extremely solid performance has been achieved thanks to the high level of hardware placement for Mail-Related Solutions  which in turns slows the decline of the leasing portfolio. The leasing portfolio and other financing services is stable at €595 million as of 31 January 2023  the same level as of 31 January 2022 helped by a positive currency impact. On an organic basis  this represents a slower decrease of 1.4% at the end of FY 2022 compared to a decrease 6.4% at the end of FY 2021. At the end of FY 2022  the default rate of the leasing portfolio stood at around 1.6% compared to 1.7% at the end of FY 2021. Interest and taxes paid decreased significantly to €35 million in FY 2022 versus €66 million in FY 2021. The lower amount paid in 2022 is mostly explained by the reimbursement of the 2020 tax loss carry-back measures in the US. Capital expenditure remained stable in 2022 at €88 million. Development capex was also stable at €36 million in 2022 (vs. €37 million in FY 2021) and was mostly spent on R&D investments for software developments and Parcel lockers innovations. Rented equipment capex was slightly up year-over-year at €30 million in FY 2022  compared to €29 million in FY 2021  thanks to the sustained level of Mail-Related Solutions hardware placements  the on-going deployment of Parcel Locker Solutions contracts in France and Japan as well as the start of the installation of the new UK open network. The small increase in maintenance capex  to €13 million  was mostly linked to software projects and IT equipment spendings. To be noted  while previously capitalised  cloud computing investments are now expensed or moved to prepaid expenses in line with the new IFRIC accounting standard for an amount of €8 million. Consequently  cash flow after capital expenditure for the year was down to €70 million in FY 2022 compared to €104 million in FY 2021. LEVERAGE AND LIQUIDITY POSITION Net debt stood at €722 million as of 31 January 2023  an increase against the €504 million of net financial debt recorded as of 31 January 2022 but this represents a significant decrease versus the €769 million  comprising the 2021 net financial debt plus the €265 million ODIRNANE facility accounted for as equity. Therefore  the overall financial structure for the Group has improved significantly in FY 2022 despite the increase in debt level which is due to the repayment in full of the ODIRNANE instrument in June 2022. The ODIRNANE was repaid following the successful issuance of a €270 Schuldschein emission in November 2021. The Group has no significant debt maturity before its €325 million 2.25% bond maturing in 2025. The leverage ratio (net debt/EBITDA) improved slightly to 3.0x5 as of 31 January 2023 versus 3.1x5 as of 31 January 2022 (adjusted for the ODIRNANE). Excluding leasing and adjusted for the ODIRNANE  the leverage ratio also improved to 1.8x5 as of 31 January 2023 vs 2.0x5 at the end of FY 2021 (31 January 2022). The Group remains focused on reaching its leverage ratio target of 1.75x5 excluding leasing as of 31 January 2024. As of 31 January 2023  the Group had a robust liquidity position of €572 million  split between €172 million in cash and a €400 million undrawn credit line  the latter maturing in 2024. Shareholders’ equity stood at € 1 082 million as of 31 January 2023 compared to €1 359 million as of 31 January 2022. The gearing ratio121010 went up to 66.7% as of 31 January 2023 from 37.1% as of 31 January 2022 due to the mechanical impact from the ODIRNANE reimbursement (double impact from lower equities and higher debt). OUTLOOK FY 2023 guidance allows to confirm the 2021-2023 financial outlook Revenue guidance Sales outlook is confirmed at minimum 3% organic sales CAGR over 2021-23FY 2023 organic sales growth is expected c.3%. Current EBIT2 guidance Current EBIT 2 outlook is confirmed at minimum mid-single digit organic 6 current EBIT 2 CAGR over 2021-23outlook is confirmed at minimum mid-single digit organic current EBIT CAGR over 2021-23 FY 2023 organic growth in current EBIT2 is expected at c.10%. In terms of the organic revenue growth  FY 2023 is expected to benefit from the positive trend in Annual Recurring Revenue for Intelligent Communication Automation  which grew at +22% organically in FY 2022 and is expected to translate into a similar level of subscription-related revenue growth in FY 2023. In addition  solid cross-selling and upselling dynamics should also continue to drive growth in future bookings. As the weight of licenses sales continues to decrease  growth for Intelligent Communication Automation is expected to gradually move closer to the subscription-related revenue growth. After two remarkable years of organic growth for Mail-Related Solutions  driven by solid hardware placements and some benefits from price increases  the outlook for FY 2023 is cautiously optimistic thanks to further benefits from price increases and further upgrade of the installed base. Parcel Locker Solutions should deliver strong organic growth in FY 2023 supported by the rising contribution of the larger installed base as well as some catch up in installations in the US following the delays recorded in FY 2022 in the residential and retail sectors. Turning to the current EBIT2  the improvement in profitability is expected to be driven by: i) The rising profitability of the installed base for both the SaaS activity and parcel lockers  ii) Continued improvement in current EBIT(1) for Intelligent Communication Automation as the transition to SaaS is almost completed  significant increase in current EBIT2 expected for Parcel Locker Solutions driven by acceleration of locker placements  whilst Mail-Related Solutions current EBIT2 margin should remain high thanks to careful price control  and iii) Lower freight costs.However  salary inflation is expected to continue.

Paris  27 March 2023  Quadient S.A. (Euronext Paris: QDT)  a leader in business solutions for meaningful customer connections through digital and physical channels  announces today its 2022 fourth-quarter consolidated sales and full-year results (period ended on 31 January 2023). The full-year 2022 results were approved by the Board of Directors during a meeting held on Friday 24 March 2023. Geoffrey Godet  Chief Executive Officer of Quadient S.A.  stated: “As we continue to make progress in the execution of our Back to Growth strategy  this year’s results benefited from a strong finish  demonstrating Quadient’s ability to reposition itself on core markets and geographies  adapt its business to a recurring subscription model while investing in solutions recognized for their leadership. This year  we posted a moderate but positive annual organic revenue growth  with a particularly robust Q4 across all solutions  while the operating profitability showed a marked improvement in H2 vs H1. Our cloud Software Solution performed strongly with a more than 20% record organic growth in Annual Recurring Revenue  driving double-digit organic growth in subscription-related revenue. With the transition from license sales to SaaS subscription nearly completed  this revenue growth is now reflected in an improving profitability trend  as already seen in the second part of the year. Mail-Related Solutions achieved a stunning performance in posting organic growth for the second consecutive year  while succeeding to maintain a high level of profitability. In addition  Mail-Related Solutions delivered strong hardware sales levels and benefitted from record cross sell between Quadient’s mailing equipment customers and its Software Solutions. Finally  Parcel Locker Solutions showed attractive growth in our European geographies while the overall performance was impacted by a high comparison basis in Q1 as well as delays in retail and residential projects in the US. Two years into the second phase of our strategic plan  we have reached a turning point in the evolution of the Group with the divestments of the remaining non-core activities  leading to the end of the Additional Operations segment and the simplification of our financial reporting. We continue to leverage our unique state-of-the-art software and smart hardware platform to drive the synergistic development of the entire Group and achieve our medium-term ambitions. Our integrated and subscription-based business model is proving very resilient in the current macro context and our ability to cross-sell and upsell our comprehensive product range to our more than 440 000 enterprises and SMB customers makes the Group uniquely positioned to continue to grow its top line while also delivering improved profitability.” A SOLID Q4 PERFORMANCE DRIVES 1.4% ORGANIC REVENUE GROWTH IN FY 2022 Group sales stood at €1 081 million in FY 2022  a 1.4% organic growth compared to FY 2021 and a 5.6% increase on a reported basis. The variation includes a positive currency impact of +6.2% or €64 million and a negative scope effect of (2.1)% or €(21) million. The changes of scope are related to the acquisition of Beanworks in March 2021  the divestment of Automated Packaging Systems in July 2021 as well as the more recent divestments of the Graphic activities in the Nordics and the Shipping business in France (both in June 2022). Segment reporting evolution and accounting changesThe sale of the Graphics activities in the Nordics and of the Shipping business in France have completed the reshaping of the Additional Operations portfolio. The remaining activities in the Additional Operations segment were mostly related to Mail-Related Solutions and Parcel Locker Solutions activities in non-core geographies  which are now being integrated into the existing Solutions activities starting at the FY 2022 reporting. The end of the Additional Operations segment has led the Group to re-organise its segment reporting based on an approach by Solution rather than the prior approach by geographies. Consequently  the Group will now provide  in addition to the revenue by Solution  the associated current EBIT(2). Details of the new reporting segments are being provided starting in FY 2022 and a pro forma FY 2021 is also shown for comparison basis. Aside from the simplification effort in segment reporting  the FY 2022 current EBIT2  both at the Group and at Solution levels  was impacted by the new IFRIC accounting standard on Cloud Software investments.

Subscription-related revenue continues to grow at a double-digit rate closing the year on an 18.5% organic growth. Q4 marked a further acceleration of the organic growth trend reaching 22.1% for the quarter. Record year for cross selling software modules to Mail-Related Solutions customers and several large subscription deals (>€1 million/year each) signed in 2022 have both contributed to this solid performance. It is also worth highlighting the fast organic increase in revenues delivered by Quadient’s Account Receivables and Account Payables modules growing at over 50% for the FY 2022. Overall  demand for Quadient’s cloud-based offering has remained strong throughout FY 2022 with each quarter of the year posting a double-digit organic increase in subscription-related revenue  which now accounts for 75% of Intelligent Communication Automation total sales in 2022 compared to only 67% in FY 2021. The share of SaaS customers reached 80% at the end of FY 2022  a further increase compared to 76% in FY 2021  also highlighting the progress made in the change in business model from license sales to a cloud-based offer. Annual recurring revenue set a new record  reaching €187 million at the end of FY 2022  up from €145 million at the end of FY 2021  representing a 22% organic increase7. Annual recurring revenue is a forward-looking indicator of future subscription-related organic growth  which is expected to further accelerate in FY 2023. With the strong increase in Subscription-related revenue  the weight of license sales continues to decrease  now only representing 8% of total Solution sales. License sales decreased by 37.6% organically in FY 2022 bringing the transformation of the business model close to completion. The negative impact of this transition on the Solution growth should therefore be more limited going forward. Professional services were slightly down organically  by 5.4%  professional services revenue being directly linked to the evolution in product mix. Current EBIT2 for Intelligent Communication Automation was negative at €(10) million  leading to an EBIT margin2 of (4.5)%. The operating profitability of Intelligent Communication Automation was mainly impacted in the first half of the year by the high inflation weighing on personnel costs  a return to normalised marketing expenses post-Covid and additional costs linked to the launch of new modules in selected European countries. The second half of the year showed a marked improvement in current EBIT2 with an EBIT margin moving from (9.7)% in H1 to 0.2% in H2 thanks to the increase in revenue and in gross margin as well as to a tight cost control  lower impact from salary inflation and reduced travel expenses. Furthermore  the on-going change in business model continues to impact the Solution profitability  whereas H1 2022 was also impacted by a high comparison basis due to a large license deal signed in Q2 2021. Current EBIT2 for the Solution is expected to improve in FY 2023 driven by the rising profitability of the installed base  the contribution from the phasing of the prices increases and the contribution from the growing revenue. In addition  the negative impact from the change in business model should continue to decline thanks to the lower weight of license sales in the revenue mix. Mail-Related Solutions Mail-Related Solutions sales reached €757 million in FY 2022  up 6.8% on a reported basis and slightly up organically (+0.1%). Revenue from Mail-Related Solutions now includes former Additional Operations Mail activities in non-core geographies for €51m. This is the second consecutive year of organic increase  a remarkable performance for Mail-Related Solutions as it comes against a high comparison basis (a 1.8% organic growth in the FY 2021) and while the second half of the year was impacted by supply chain disruption. Looking at the geographic contributions  this outstanding performance was mostly driven by organic growth from North America (both subscription-related revenue and license & hardware sales)  while the Main European countries showed contrasted contributions. The solid performance in hardware sales also continued with a 4.3% organic increase in FY 2022  fuelled by a very strong Q4 at +9.1% organic growth. Quadient’s strategy to renew its product offering is bearing fruits with an increasing penetration of the new generation of products. The share of the upgraded installed base is reaching 19.9% at the end of FY 2022  vs 11.7% at the end of FY 2021. Placement of remanufactured mailing equipment is also gathering pace with the remanufacturing level reaching 73% at the end of the year  well ahead of the 50% level targeted by the Group for 2023. Subscription-related revenues (69% of Mail-Related Solutions sales) recorded a limited 1.7% decline in FY 2022. This solid performance is driven by both the resilience of the installed base and the multi-year largely indexed contracts. Current EBIT2 for Mail-Related Solutions was €186 million for FY 2022 including a c.€(3) million negative impact from the new IFRIC accounting standard for cloud computing. Current EBIT margin for FY 2022 was 24.5%. The high profitability level of Mail-Related Solutions is even more remarkable given the high inflationary environment as well as still high freight costs. Record cross-selling of Intelligent Communication Software leading to increased costs synergies  strong focus on costs control  continuous increase in remanufacturing placements and the benefit from the indexation have all contributed to this solid performance. Current EBIT2 for the Solution is expected to remain solid in FY 2023 supported by a tight focus on cost control  a positive outlook in North America and further penetration of new generation mail equipment. Parcel Locker Solutions Parcel Locker Solutions sales increased by 5.6% to €91 million in FY 2022  a 0.4% organic increase compared to FY 2021. FY 2022 revenue includes Lockers activities in non-core geographies from the former Additional Operations segment for €4 million. License and hardware sales were down 12.6% organically in FY 2022 impacted  on the one hand  by an unfavourable comparison basis linked to the final phase of the deployment of a large North American retail contract in Q1 2021  and  on the other hand  by the delays in retail and residential projects in the US. Subscription-related revenues were up 10.0% organically supported by the deployment of existing contracts  solid usage rate (standing at 64% at the end of FY 2022) and the benefits from price increases on the installed base. Subscription-related revenue stands at 59% of total revenue for Parcel Locker Solutions. The deployment of a new open network of lockers in the UK  launched in June 2022  is gathering momentum. DPD  DHL and Evri have all officially announced that they will use the network for the delivery of their volumes  while a fourth carrier has recently also joined the network. The targeted number of installed lockers is set at 5 000  to be deployed in the coming years. Quadient’s global installed locker base reached 18 000+ units at the end of FY 2022. Current EBIT2 for Parcel Locker Solutions was negative at €(25) million in 2022  with a current EBIT margin of (27.8)%. Current EBIT margin for the existing installed base was 12.5% vs 11.3% a year ago. Profitability in 2022 has been impacted by several one-off factors  namely: i) Increased costs associated with the development and the launch of new products  ii) Go-to-market and initial deployment costs associated with the new UK open-network  and iii) Delays in retail deals and residential installations in the US.Profitability is expected to increase in FY 2023 supported by declining freight costs  lower costs associated with product launches and the UK open network as well as the rising profitability of the installed base and benefits from the phasing of price increases.

Sales in North America (55% of Group sales) were up 3.0% organically to €599 million and 15.4% on a reported basis. Solid hardware sales for Mail-Related Solutions as well as a strong performance from Intelligent Communication Automation were the main contributors to the growth in the region. Penetration of Quadient’s cloud-based solutions continues to be well supported by successful cross-selling with two-thirds of new Software customers coming from the Mail customer base. Quadient’s Account Receivables and Account Payables solutions also performed well in the region contributing to the overall solid performance for the year. Parcel Locker Solutions  however  suffered from both delays in the deployment of retail and residential projects and from a high comparison basis with the completion of the roll-out of a large retail contract in Q1 2021. Main European countries (34% of Group sales) were marginally down by 1.4% on an organic basis to €372 million. Performance has been contrasted by countries and by Solution in this region. Mail-Related Solutions performed well in terms of hardware sales in most European countries except for France. For Intelligent Communication Automation  penetration of the recently launched Account Receivables and Account Payables modules have started to contribute to the growth in the region but the decline in license sales due to the change in business model continues to impact the overall growth. Parcel Locker Solutions was the main contributor to growth in the region (+c.50% on an organic basis)  benefiting from the on-going deployment of the recently signed contracts most notably in France. The International segment (10% of Group sales) delivered a 3.6% organic growth  to €110 million  mostly driven by the good dynamics of both Intelligent Communication Automation and Parcel Locker Solutions. Q4 2022 SALES Consolidated sales stood at €288 million in the fourth quarter of 2022  up 5.5% on a reported basis and 3.1% on an organic basis compared to the fourth quarter of 2021.

A solid performance achieved in difficult conditions with the high inflation level impacting all costs aspects and freight costs still at elevated levels. Tight cost control as well as the positive business development and price increases all contributed to this improvement in gross margin. Current operating income before acquisition-related expenses increased to €150 million in FY 2022 compared to €147 million in FY 2021  up 2.2% on a reported basis and down 4.8% on an organic3 basis. The current operating income before acquisition-related expenses includes a €5 million negative impact from the new IFRIC rule for cloud computing. Current operating margin before acquisition-related expenses stood at 13.9% of sales in 2022 compared to 14.3% in 2021. Excluding the negative IFRIC impact  the current operating margin before acquisition-related expenses would have been stable year over year at 14.3%. The Group’s operating profitability was impacted by higher personnel costs  increased R&D  and go-to-market spendings. Investments into scaling the network of parcel lockers with the launch of the UK open network also weighed on profitability as well as the recent delays in retail and residential lockers projects in the US. Price increases through the year  the benefit of indexation for part of the Group’s installed base as well as tight cost control helped mitigate these negative elements. As anticipated  H2 current EBIT margin showed a marked improvement versus H1 2022 level  at 16.1% excluding IFRIC vs 12.5%. The solid H2 performance was driven by all three Solutions with notably Intelligent Communication Automation showing strong recovery while Mail-Related Solutions managed to further improve an already high level of profitability. With no significant M&A activities in FY 2022  acquisition-related expenses declined slightly to €10 million in FY 2022  compared to €12 million in 2021. Consequently  current operating income stood at €140 million in 2022 including the negative IFRIC impact  compared to €135 million in FY 2021. Optimization costs and other operating expenses stood at €73 million in FY 2022  versus €19 million in FY 2021. In particular  this included: i) Goodwill impairment for €48 million  resulting from the WACC increase in UK  Ireland and DACHIT regions and tax rate increase in the UK ii) Real estate write-offs linked to the optimisation of the office footprint for a total amount of €16 million Including these non-current items  operating income for FY 2022 was €67 million  versus €116 million recorded in FY 2021. Net attributable income 2022 net cost of debt was marginally up year-on-year at €27 million  against €25 million in FY 2021. The increase is mainly due to the refinancing of the ODIRNANE instrument  which was booked in equity  through the emission of Schuldschein debt in November 2021. The currency gains & losses and other financial items were a loss of €9 million in 2022 versus a gain of €17 million in FY 2021. This is partly due to a decrease of €5 million in the fair value of the investment made by Quadient in private equity funds X’Ange 2 and Partech Entrepreneurs while  in FY 2021  currency gains and other financial items benefited from the €20 million increase in the fair value of these investments. Overall  net financial result was a loss of €36 million in FY 2022 compared to a loss of €8 million in FY 2021. Income tax decreased to €16 million in FY 2022 versus €20 million in FY 2021. This is mainly due to the favourable impact of a tax loss carry forward recognition  partly offset by an increase in the tax charge in the United States. The corporate tax rate stood at 54.8% in FY 2022 compared to 18.1% in FY 2021. This high rate is mainly owing to the impairment of goodwill recorded this year. Restated for this item  the corporate tax rate would be 21.4% and marks a return to a more normal level. Net attributable income after minority interest amounted to €13 million in FY 2022 compared to €88 million in FY 2021. Earnings per share8 stood at €0.29 in FY 2022 compared to €2.32 in FY 2021. Proposed dividend at €0.60 per share for the FY 2022  a 9% increase against the FY 2021 dividend. The dividend is subject to approval by the Annual General Meeting  scheduled for 16 June 2023  and will be paid in cash in one instalment on 7 August 2023. Cash flow generation EBITDA9F9 was €240 million in FY 2022 compared to €245 million in FY 2021. EBITDA margin decreased from 23.9% in FY 2021 to 22.2% in FY 2022. Excluding the negative IFRIC impact  EBITDA margin for the FY 2022 would have been 22.7%. The decline in EBITDA margin was mainly due to increased go to market efforts to support the Group’s growth engines  product launches in new geographies as well as the impact from salary inflation. The change in working capital was negative by €38 million in FY 2022 compared to a net cash outflow of €8 million in FY 2021. The degradation in working capital was primarily driven by the higher level of inventories at the end of the year due to both supply chain disruptions for the Mail business and delays in retail and residential projects for the Parcel Locker Solutions. The slower collection of receivables compared to the exceptional level in FY 2021 (catch up impact post Covid-19 crisis) also impacted the working capital. Lease receivables recorded a remarkable small decrease of only €8 million in FY 2022 compared to a decrease of €39 million in FY 2021. This extremely solid performance has been achieved thanks to the high level of hardware placement for Mail-Related Solutions  which in turns slows the decline of the leasing portfolio. The leasing portfolio and other financing services is stable at €595 million as of 31 January 2023  the same level as of 31 January 2022 helped by a positive currency impact. On an organic basis  this represents a slower decrease of 1.4% at the end of FY 2022 compared to a decrease 6.4% at the end of FY 2021. At the end of FY 2022  the default rate of the leasing portfolio stood at around 1.6% compared to 1.7% at the end of FY 2021. Interest and taxes paid decreased significantly to €35 million in FY 2022 versus €66 million in FY 2021. The lower amount paid in 2022 is mostly explained by the reimbursement of the 2020 tax loss carry-back measures in the US. Capital expenditure remained stable in 2022 at €88 million. Development capex was also stable at €36 million in 2022 (vs. €37 million in FY 2021) and was mostly spent on R&D investments for software developments and Parcel lockers innovations. Rented equipment capex was slightly up year-over-year at €30 million in FY 2022  compared to €29 million in FY 2021  thanks to the sustained level of Mail-Related Solutions hardware placements  the on-going deployment of Parcel Locker Solutions contracts in France and Japan as well as the start of the installation of the new UK open network. The small increase in maintenance capex  to €13 million  was mostly linked to software projects and IT equipment spendings. To be noted  while previously capitalised  cloud computing investments are now expensed or moved to prepaid expenses in line with the new IFRIC accounting standard for an amount of €8 million. Consequently  cash flow after capital expenditure for the year was down to €70 million in FY 2022 compared to €104 million in FY 2021. LEVERAGE AND LIQUIDITY POSITION Net debt stood at €722 million as of 31 January 2023  an increase against the €504 million of net financial debt recorded as of 31 January 2022 but this represents a significant decrease versus the €769 million  comprising the 2021 net financial debt plus the €265 million ODIRNANE facility accounted for as equity. Therefore  the overall financial structure for the Group has improved significantly in FY 2022 despite the increase in debt level which is due to the repayment in full of the ODIRNANE instrument in June 2022. The ODIRNANE was repaid following the successful issuance of a €270 Schuldschein emission in November 2021. The Group has no significant debt maturity before its €325 million 2.25% bond maturing in 2025. The leverage ratio (net debt/EBITDA) improved slightly to 3.0x5 as of 31 January 2023 versus 3.1x5 as of 31 January 2022 (adjusted for the ODIRNANE). Excluding leasing and adjusted for the ODIRNANE  the leverage ratio also improved to 1.8x5 as of 31 January 2023 vs 2.0x5 at the end of FY 2021 (31 January 2022). The Group remains focused on reaching its leverage ratio target of 1.75x5 excluding leasing as of 31 January 2024. As of 31 January 2023  the Group had a robust liquidity position of €572 million  split between €172 million in cash and a €400 million undrawn credit line  the latter maturing in 2024. Shareholders’ equity stood at € 1 082 million as of 31 January 2023 compared to €1 359 million as of 31 January 2022. The gearing ratio121010 went up to 66.7% as of 31 January 2023 from 37.1% as of 31 January 2022 due to the mechanical impact from the ODIRNANE reimbursement (double impact from lower equities and higher debt). OUTLOOK FY 2023 guidance allows to confirm the 2021-2023 financial outlook Revenue guidance Sales outlook is confirmed at minimum 3% organic sales CAGR over 2021-23FY 2023 organic sales growth is expected c.3%. Current EBIT2 guidance Current EBIT 2 outlook is confirmed at minimum mid-single digit organic 6 current EBIT 2 CAGR over 2021-23outlook is confirmed at minimum mid-single digit organic current EBIT CAGR over 2021-23 FY 2023 organic growth in current EBIT2 is expected at c.10%. In terms of the organic revenue growth  FY 2023 is expected to benefit from the positive trend in Annual Recurring Revenue for Intelligent Communication Automation  which grew at +22% organically in FY 2022 and is expected to translate into a similar level of subscription-related revenue growth in FY 2023. In addition  solid cross-selling and upselling dynamics should also continue to drive growth in future bookings. As the weight of licenses sales continues to decrease  growth for Intelligent Communication Automation is expected to gradually move closer to the subscription-related revenue growth. After two remarkable years of organic growth for Mail-Related Solutions  driven by solid hardware placements and some benefits from price increases  the outlook for FY 2023 is cautiously optimistic thanks to further benefits from price increases and further upgrade of the installed base. Parcel Locker Solutions should deliver strong organic growth in FY 2023 supported by the rising contribution of the larger installed base as well as some catch up in installations in the US following the delays recorded in FY 2022 in the residential and retail sectors. Turning to the current EBIT2  the improvement in profitability is expected to be driven by: i) The rising profitability of the installed base for both the SaaS activity and parcel lockers  ii) Continued improvement in current EBIT(1) for Intelligent Communication Automation as the transition to SaaS is almost completed  significant increase in current EBIT2 expected for Parcel Locker Solutions driven by acceleration of locker placements  whilst Mail-Related Solutions current EBIT2 margin should remain high thanks to careful price control  and iii) Lower freight costs.However  salary inflation is expected to continue.

(Euronext Paris: QDT)  a leader in business solutions for meaningful customer connections through digital and physical channels  announces today its 2022 fourth-quarter consolidated sales and full-year results (period ended on 31 January 2023). The full-year 2022 results were approved by the Board of Directors during a meeting held on Friday 24 March 2023.Geoffrey Godet  Chief Executive Officer of Quadient S.A.  stated: “As we continue to make progress in the execution of our Back to Growth strategy  this year’s results benefited from a strong finish  demonstrating Quadient’s ability to reposition itself on core markets and geographies  adapt its business to a recurring subscription model while investing in solutions recognized for their leadership. This year  we posted a moderate but positive annual organic revenue growth  with a particularly robust Q4 across all solutions  while the operating profitability showed a marked improvement in H2 vs H1. Our cloud Software Solution performed strongly with a more than 20% record organic growth in Annual Recurring Revenue  driving double-digit organic growth in subscription-related revenue. With the transition from license sales to SaaS subscription nearly completed  this revenue growth is now reflected in an improving profitability trend  as already seen in the second part of the year. Mail-Related Solutions achieved a stunning performance in posting organic growth for the second consecutive year  while succeeding to maintain a high level of profitability. In addition  Mail-Related Solutions delivered strong hardware sales levels and benefitted from record cross sell between Quadient’s mailing equipment customers and its Software Solutions. Finally  Parcel Locker Solutions showed attractive growth in our European geographies while the overall performance was impacted by a high comparison basis in Q1 as well as delays in retail and residential projects in the US.Two years into the second phase of our strategic plan  we have reached a turning point in the evolution of the Group with the divestments of the remaining non-core activities  leading to the end of the Additional Operations segment and the simplification of our financial reporting. We continue to leverage our unique state-of-the-art software and smart hardware platform to drive the synergistic development of the entire Group and achieve our medium-term ambitions. Our integrated and subscription-based business model is proving very resilient in the current macro context and our ability to cross-sell and upsell our comprehensive product range to our more than 440 000 enterprises and SMB customers makes the Group uniquely positioned to continue to grow its top line while also delivering improved profitability.”A SOLID Q4 PERFORMANCE DRIVES 1.4% ORGANIC REVENUE GROWTH IN FY 2022Group sales stood at €1 081 million in FY 2022  a 1.4% organic growth compared to FY 2021 and a 5.6% increase on a reported basis. The variation includes a positive currency impact of +6.2% or €64 million and a negative scope effect of (2.1)% or €(21) million. The changes of scope are related to the acquisition of Beanworks in March 2021  the divestment of Automated Packaging Systems in July 2021 as well as the more recent divestments of the Graphic activities in the Nordics and the Shipping business in France (both in June 2022).Segment reporting evolution and accounting changesThe sale of the Graphics activities in the Nordics and of the Shipping business in France have completed the reshaping of the Additional Operations portfolio. The remaining activities in the Additional Operations segment were mostly related to Mail-Related Solutions and Parcel Locker Solutions activities in non-core geographies  which are now being integrated into the existing Solutions activities starting at the FY 2022 reporting.The end of the Additional Operations segment has led the Group to re-organise its segment reporting based on an approach by Solution rather than the prior approach by geographies. Consequently  the Group will now provide  in addition to the revenue by Solution  the associated current EBIT(2). Details of the new reporting segments are being provided starting in FY 2022 and a pro forma FY 2021 is also shown for comparison basis.Aside from the simplification effort in segment reporting  the FY 2022 current EBIT2  both at the Group and at Solution levels  was impacted by the new IFRIC accounting standard on Cloud Software investments. At Group level  the FY 2022 negative impact on current EBIT2 was €(5) million.Consolidated sales and current EBIT2 by SolutionConsolidated SalesIn € million FY 2022 FY 2021pro forma(a) Change Organic change1 Intelligent Communication Automation 227 201 +12.8% +6.3% Mail-Related Solutions 757 710(a) +6.7% +0.1% Parcel Locker Solutions 91 86(a) +5.6% +0.4% Other solutions divested in 2022 5 27(a) (80.4)% +12.5% Group total 1 081 1 024 +5.6% +1.4% (a) Mail-Related Solutions and Parcel Locker Solutions now includes activities previously accounting for in Additional Operations.Current EBIT(a) and EBIT Margin (a)FY 2022(Including new 2022 IFRIC) FY 2022(Excluding new 2022 IFRIC) FY 2021 pro forma(b)(no IFRIC impact) In € million Current EBIT(c) EBIT Margin(c) Current EBIT(c) EBIT Margin(c) Current EBIT EBIT Margin Intelligent Communication Automation (10) (4.5)% (9) (4.1)% (3) (1.6)% Mail-Related Solutions 186 24.5% 189 25.0% 171 24.1% Parcel Locker Solutions (25) (27.8)% (25) (27.4)% (19) (22.0)% Other solutions divested in 2022 (0) (5.3)% (0) (5.3)% (2) (8.6)% Group total 150 13.9% 155 14.3% 147 14.3%(a) Before acquisition-related expenses(b) Mail-Related Solutions and Parcel Locker Solutions now includes activities previously accounting for in Additional Operations.(c) 2022 current EBIT and EBIT margin were negatively impacted by the €5 million negative impact from the new IFRIC accounting standard for cloud computingIntelligent Communication AutomationSales from Intelligent Communication Automation were up 6.3% organically and 12.8% on a reported basis to €227 million. Subscription-related revenue continues to grow at a double-digit rate closing the year on an 18.5% organic growth. Q4 marked a further acceleration of the organic growth trend reaching 22.1% for the quarter. Record year for cross selling software modules to Mail-Related Solutions customers and several large subscription deals (>€1 million/year each) signed in 2022 have both contributed to this solid performance. It is also worth highlighting the fast organic increase in revenues delivered by Quadient’s Account Receivables and Account Payables modules growing at over 50% for the FY 2022. Overall  demand for Quadient’s cloud-based offering has remained strong throughout FY 2022 with each quarter of the year posting a double-digit organic increase in subscription-related revenue  which now accounts for 75% of Intelligent Communication Automation total sales in 2022 compared to only 67% in FY 2021.The share of SaaS customers reached 80% at the end of FY 2022  a further increase compared to 76% in FY 2021  also highlighting the progress made in the change in business model from license sales to a cloud-based offer. Annual recurring revenue set a new record  reaching €187 million at the end of FY 2022  up from €145 million at the end of FY 2021  representing a 22% organic increase7. Annual recurring revenue is a forward-looking indicator of future subscription-related organic growth  which is expected to further accelerate in FY 2023.With the strong increase in Subscription-related revenue  the weight of license sales continues to decrease  now only representing 8% of total Solution sales. License sales decreased by 37.6% organically in FY 2022 bringing the transformation of the business model close to completion. The negative impact of this transition on the Solution growth should therefore be more limited going forward. Professional services were slightly down organically  by 5.4%  professional services revenue being directly linked to the evolution in product mix.Current EBIT2 for Intelligent Communication Automation was negative at €(10) million  leading to an EBIT margin2 of (4.5)%. The operating profitability of Intelligent Communication Automation was mainly impacted in the first half of the year by the high inflation weighing on personnel costs  a return to normalised marketing expenses post-Covid and additional costs linked to the launch of new modules in selected European countries. The second half of the year showed a marked improvement in current EBIT2 with an EBIT margin moving from (9.7)% in H1 to 0.2% in H2 thanks to the increase in revenue and in gross margin as well as to a tight cost control  lower impact from salary inflation and reduced travel expenses. Furthermore  the on-going change in business model continues to impact the Solution profitability  whereas H1 2022 was also impacted by a high comparison basis due to a large license deal signed in Q2 2021.Current EBIT2 for the Solution is expected to improve in FY 2023 driven by the rising profitability of the installed base  the contribution from the phasing of the prices increases and the contribution from the growing revenue. In addition  the negative impact from the change in business model should continue to decline thanks to the lower weight of license sales in the revenue mix.Mail-Related SolutionsMail-Related Solutions sales reached €757 million in FY 2022  up 6.8% on a reported basis and slightly up organically (+0.1%). Revenue from Mail-Related Solutions now includes former Additional Operations Mail activities in non-core geographies for €51m. This is the second consecutive year of organic increase  a remarkable performance for Mail-Related Solutions as it comes against a high comparison basis (a 1.8% organic growth in the FY 2021) and while the second half of the year was impacted by supply chain disruption. Looking at the geographic contributions  this outstanding performance was mostly driven by organic growth from North America (both subscription-related revenue and license & hardware sales)  while the Main European countries showed contrasted contributions.The solid performance in hardware sales also continued with a 4.3% organic increase in FY 2022  fuelled by a very strong Q4 at +9.1% organic growth. Quadient’s strategy to renew its product offering is bearing fruits with an increasing penetration of the new generation of products. The share of the upgraded installed base is reaching 19.9% at the end of FY 2022  vs 11.7% at the end of FY 2021. Placement of remanufactured mailing equipment is also gathering pace with the remanufacturing level reaching 73% at the end of the year  well ahead of the 50% level targeted by the Group for 2023.Subscription-related revenues (69% of Mail-Related Solutions sales) recorded a limited 1.7% decline in FY 2022. This solid performance is driven by both the resilience of the installed base and the multi-year largely indexed contracts.Current EBIT2 for Mail-Related Solutions was €186 million for FY 2022 including a c.€(3) million negative impact from the new IFRIC accounting standard for cloud computing. Current EBIT margin for FY 2022 was 24.5%. The high profitability level of Mail-Related Solutions is even more remarkable given the high inflationary environment as well as still high freight costs. Record cross-selling of Intelligent Communication Software leading to increased costs synergies  strong focus on costs control  continuous increase in remanufacturing placements and the benefit from the indexation have all contributed to this solid performance.Current EBIT2 for the Solution is expected to remain solid in FY 2023 supported by a tight focus on cost control  a positive outlook in North America and further penetration of new generation mail equipment.Parcel Locker SolutionsParcel Locker Solutions sales increased by 5.6% to €91 million in FY 2022  a 0.4% organic increase compared to FY 2021. FY 2022 revenue includes Lockers activities in non-core geographies from the former Additional Operations segment for €4 million.License and hardware sales were down 12.6% organically in FY 2022 impacted  on the one hand  by an unfavourable comparison basis linked to the final phase of the deployment of a large North American retail contract in Q1 2021  and  on the other hand  by the delays in retail and residential projects in the US.Subscription-related revenues were up 10.0% organically supported by the deployment of existing contracts  solid usage rate (standing at 64% at the end of FY 2022) and the benefits from price increases on the installed base. Subscription-related revenue stands at 59% of total revenue for Parcel Locker Solutions.The deployment of a new open network of lockers in the UK  launched in June 2022  is gathering momentum. DPD  DHL and Evri have all officially announced that they will use the network for the delivery of their volumes  while a fourth carrier has recently also joined the network. The targeted number of installed lockers is set at 5 000  to be deployed in the coming years.Quadient’s global installed locker base reached 18 000+ units at the end of FY 2022.Current EBIT2 for Parcel Locker Solutions was negative at €(25) million in 2022  with a current EBIT margin of (27.8)%. Current EBIT margin for the existing installed base was 12.5% vs 11.3% a year ago. Profitability in 2022 has been impacted by several one-off factors  namely:i) Increased costs associated with the development and the launch of new products ii) Go-to-market and initial deployment costs associated with the new UK open-network  andiii) Delays in retail deals and residential installations in the US.Profitability is expected to increase in FY 2023 supported by declining freight costs  lower costs associated with product launches and the UK open network as well as the rising profitability of the installed base and benefits from the phasing of price increases.Consolidated sales by geographiesIn € million FY 2022 FY 2021Pro forma Change Organic change1 North America 599 519 +15.4% +3.0% Main European countries(a) 372 376 (1.0)% (1.4)% International(b) 110 128 (14.7)% +3.6% Group total 1 081 1 024 +5.6% +1.4% (a) Including Austria  Benelux  France  Germany  Ireland  Italy  Switzerland  and the United Kingdom.(b) International includes the activities of Intelligent Communication Automation  Mail-Related Solutions and Parcel Locker Solutions outside of North America and the Main European countries as well as divested other solutions previously recorded under Additional Operations.Sales in North America (55% of Group sales) were up 3.0% organically to €599 million and 15.4% on a reported basis. Solid hardware sales for Mail-Related Solutions as well as a strong performance from Intelligent Communication Automation were the main contributors to the growth in the region. Penetration of Quadient’s cloud-based solutions continues to be well supported by successful cross-selling with two-thirds of new Software customers coming from the Mail customer base. Quadient’s Account Receivables and Account Payables solutions also performed well in the region contributing to the overall solid performance for the year. Parcel Locker Solutions  however  suffered from both delays in the deployment of retail and residential projects and from a high comparison basis with the completion of the roll-out of a large retail contract in Q1 2021.Main European countries (34% of Group sales) were marginally down by 1.4% on an organic basis to €372 million. Performance has been contrasted by countries and by Solution in this region. Mail-Related Solutions performed well in terms of hardware sales in most European countries except for France. For Intelligent Communication Automation  penetration of the recently launched Account Receivables and Account Payables modules have started to contribute to the growth in the region but the decline in license sales due to the change in business model continues to impact the overall growth. Parcel Locker Solutions was the main contributor to growth in the region (+c.50% on an organic basis)  benefiting from the on-going deployment of the recently signed contracts most notably in France.The International segment (10% of Group sales) delivered a 3.6% organic growth  to €110 million  mostly driven by the good dynamics of both Intelligent Communication Automation and Parcel Locker Solutions.Q4 2022 SALESConsolidated sales stood at €288 million in the fourth quarter of 2022  up 5.5% on a reported basis and 3.1% on an organic basis compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. A solid performance driven by all three Solutions and all geographies  demonstrating an acceleration of the revenue growth trend through the year.In € million Q4 2022 Q4 2021Pro forma Change Organicchange1 Intelligent Communication Automation 61 54 +13.1% +9.0% Mail-Related Solutions 202 193 +4.9% +0.9% Parcel Locker Solutions 25 23 +9.6% +7.5% Other solutions divested in 2022 0 4 (100)% (100)% Group total 288 273 +5.5% +3.1%Intelligent Communication Automation sales were strongly up with 9.0% organic growth to €61 million after a slower Q3 2022  the Subscription-related revenue showing the strongest organic growth of the year at +22.1%  more than offsetting the decline in license sales.Mail-Related Solutions sales continued to show strong resilience  reaching €202 million  up by 0.9% on an organic basis benefiting from the reduction of the backlog despite further supply chain issues.Parcel Locker Solutions sales stood at €25 million in Q4 2022  with a +7.5% organic growth compared to Q4 2021 thanks to the ongoing deployment of existing contracts in France and the UK.In € million Q4 2022 Q4 2021 Change Organicchange1 North America 157 141 +10.9% +2.8% Main European countries(a) 101 99 +2.3% +2.6% International(b) 30 32 (8.2)% +5.8% Group total 288 273 +5.5% +3.1% (a) Including Austria  Benelux  France  Germany  Ireland  Italy  Switzerland  and the United Kingdom.(b) International includes the activities of Intelligent Communication Automation  Mail-Related Solutions and Parcel Locker Solutions outside of North America and the Main European countries.North America posted 2.8% organic growth in the quarter  with a double-digit growth in Intelligent Communication Automation and Mail-Related Solutions posting positive organic growth.Main European Countries posted a 2.6% organic growth  fuelled by a remarkable performance of both Mail-Related Solutions and Parcel Locker Solutions  the latter benefitting from the development of the recent contracts in France.International grew +5.8% organically with all solutions contributing to the growth.REVIEW OF 2022 FULL-YEAR RESULTSSimplified P&LIn € million FY 2022(including IFRIC) FY 2021(No IFRIC impact) Change Sales 1 081 1 024 +5.6% Gross profit 790 744 +6.2% Gross margin 73.1% 72.6% EBITDA 240 245 (2.0)% EBITDA margin 22.2% 23.9% Current operating income before acquisition-related expenses 150 147 +2.2% Current operating income margin (before acquisition related expenses) 13.9% 14.3% Current operating income 140 135 +3.5% Optimization expenses and other operating income & expenses (73) (19) n.m. Operating income 67 116 (42.6)% Financial income/(expense) (36) (8) n.m. Net attributable income 13 88 (84.9)% Earnings per share 0.29 2.32 Diluted earnings per share 0.29 2.17Gross margin improved to 73.1% in FY 2022 compared to 72.6% in FY 2021. A solid performance achieved in difficult conditions with the high inflation level impacting all costs aspects and freight costs still at elevated levels. Tight cost control as well as the positive business development and price increases all contributed to this improvement in gross margin.Current operating income before acquisition-related expenses increased to €150 million in FY 2022 compared to €147 million in FY 2021  up 2.2% on a reported basis and down 4.8% on an organic3 basis. The current operating income before acquisition-related expenses includes a €5 million negative impact from the new IFRIC rule for cloud computing. Current operating margin before acquisition-related expenses stood at 13.9% of sales in 2022 compared to 14.3% in 2021. Excluding the negative IFRIC impact  the current operating margin before acquisition-related expenses would have been stable year over year at 14.3%. The Group’s operating profitability was impacted by higher personnel costs  increased R&D  and go-to-market spendings. Investments into scaling the network of parcel lockers with the launch of the UK open network also weighed on profitability as well as the recent delays in retail and residential lockers projects in the US. Price increases through the year  the benefit of indexation for part of the Group’s installed base as well as tight cost control helped mitigate these negative elements. As anticipated  H2 current EBIT margin showed a marked improvement versus H1 2022 level  at 16.1% excluding IFRIC vs 12.5%. The solid H2 performance was driven by all three Solutions with notably Intelligent Communication Automation showing strong recovery while Mail-Related Solutions managed to further improve an already high level of profitability.With no significant M&A activities in FY 2022  acquisition-related expenses declined slightly to €10 million in FY 2022  compared to €12 million in 2021. Consequently  current operating income stood at €140 million in 2022 including the negative IFRIC impact  compared to €135 million in FY 2021.Optimization costs and other operating expenses stood at €73 million in FY 2022  versus €19 million in FY 2021. In particular  this included:i) Goodwill impairment for €48 million  resulting from the WACC increase in UK  Ireland and DACHIT regions and tax rate increase in the UKii) Real estate write-offs linked to the optimisation of the office footprint for a total amount of €16 millionIncluding these non-current items  operating income for FY 2022 was €67 million  versus €116 million recorded in FY 2021.Net attributable income2022 net cost of debt was marginally up year-on-year at €27 million  against €25 million in FY 2021. The increase is mainly due to the refinancing of the ODIRNANE instrument  which was booked in equity  through the emission of Schuldschein debt in November 2021.The currency gains & losses and other financial items were a loss of €9 million in 2022 versus a gain of €17 million in FY 2021. This is partly due to a decrease of €5 million in the fair value of the investment made by Quadient in private equity funds X’Ange 2 and Partech Entrepreneurs while  in FY 2021  currency gains and other financial items benefited from the €20 million increase in the fair value of these investments.Overall  net financial result was a loss of €36 million in FY 2022 compared to a loss of €8 million in FY 2021.Income tax decreased to €16 million in FY 2022 versus €20 million in FY 2021. This is mainly due to the favourable impact of a tax loss carry forward recognition  partly offset by an increase in the tax charge in the United States.The corporate tax rate stood at 54.8% in FY 2022 compared to 18.1% in FY 2021. This high rate is mainly owing to the impairment of goodwill recorded this year. Restated for this item  the corporate tax rate would be 21.4% and marks a return to a more normal level.Net attributable income after minority interest amounted to €13 million in FY 2022 compared to €88 million in FY 2021.Earnings per share8 stood at €0.29 in FY 2022 compared to €2.32 in FY 2021.Proposed dividend at €0.60 per share for the FY 2022  a 9% increase against the FY 2021 dividend. The dividend is subject to approval by the Annual General Meeting  scheduled for 16 June 2023  and will be paid in cash in one instalment on 7 August 2023.Cash flow generationEBITDA9F9 was €240 million in FY 2022 compared to €245 million in FY 2021. EBITDA margin decreased from 23.9% in FY 2021 to 22.2% in FY 2022. Excluding the negative IFRIC impact  EBITDA margin for the FY 2022 would have been 22.7%. The decline in EBITDA margin was mainly due to increased go to market efforts to support the Group’s growth engines  product launches in new geographies as well as the impact from salary inflation.The change in working capital was negative by €38 million in FY 2022 compared to a net cash outflow of €8 million in FY 2021. The degradation in working capital was primarily driven by the higher level of inventories at the end of the year due to both supply chain disruptions for the Mail business and delays in retail and residential projects for the Parcel Locker Solutions. The slower collection of receivables compared to the exceptional level in FY 2021 (catch up impact post Covid-19 crisis) also impacted the working capital.Lease receivables recorded a remarkable small decrease of only €8 million in FY 2022 compared to a decrease of €39 million in FY 2021. This extremely solid performance has been achieved thanks to the high level of hardware placement for Mail-Related Solutions  which in turns slows the decline of the leasing portfolio.The leasing portfolio and other financing services is stable at €595 million as of 31 January 2023  the same level as of 31 January 2022 helped by a positive currency impact. On an organic basis  this represents a slower decrease of 1.4% at the end of FY 2022 compared to a decrease 6.4% at the end of FY 2021. At the end of FY 2022  the default rate of the leasing portfolio stood at around 1.6% compared to 1.7% at the end of FY 2021.Interest and taxes paid decreased significantly to €35 million in FY 2022 versus €66 million in FY 2021. The lower amount paid in 2022 is mostly explained by the reimbursement of the 2020 tax loss carry-back measures in the US.Capital expenditure remained stable in 2022 at €88 million. Development capex was also stable at €36 million in 2022 (vs. €37 million in FY 2021) and was mostly spent on R&D investments for software developments and Parcel lockers innovations. Rented equipment capex was slightly up year-over-year at €30 million in FY 2022  compared to €29 million in FY 2021  thanks to the sustained level of Mail-Related Solutions hardware placements  the on-going deployment of Parcel Locker Solutions contracts in France and Japan as well as the start of the installation of the new UK open network. The small increase in maintenance capex  to €13 million  was mostly linked to software projects and IT equipment spendings. To be noted  while previously capitalised  cloud computing investments are now expensed or moved to prepaid expenses in line with the new IFRIC accounting standard for an amount of €8 million.Consequently  cash flow after capital expenditure for the year was down to €70 million in FY 2022 compared to €104 million in FY 2021.LEVERAGE AND LIQUIDITY POSITIONNet debt stood at €722 million as of 31 January 2023  an increase against the €504 million of net financial debt recorded as of 31 January 2022 but this represents a significant decrease versus the €769 million  comprising the 2021 net financial debt plus the €265 million ODIRNANE facility accounted for as equity. Therefore  the overall financial structure for the Group has improved significantly in FY 2022 despite the increase in debt level which is due to the repayment in full of the ODIRNANE instrument in June 2022. The ODIRNANE was repaid following the successful issuance of a €270 Schuldschein emission in November 2021. The Group has no significant debt maturity before its €325 million 2.25% bond maturing in 2025.The leverage ratio (net debt/EBITDA) improved slightly to 3.0x5 as of 31 January 2023 versus 3.1x5 as of 31 January 2022 (adjusted for the ODIRNANE). Excluding leasing and adjusted for the ODIRNANE  the leverage ratio also improved to 1.8x5 as of 31 January 2023 vs 2.0x5 at the end of FY 2021 (31 January 2022). The Group remains focused on reaching its leverage ratio target of 1.75x5 excluding leasing as of 31 January 2024.As of 31 January 2023  the Group had a robust liquidity position of €572 million  split between €172 million in cash and a €400 million undrawn credit line  the latter maturing in 2024.Shareholders’ equity stood at € 1 082 million as of 31 January 2023 compared to €1 359 million as of 31 January 2022. The gearing ratio121010 went up to 66.7% as of 31 January 2023 from 37.1% as of 31 January 2022 due to the mechanical impact from the ODIRNANE reimbursement (double impact from lower equities and higher debt).OUTLOOKFY 2023 guidance allows to confirm the 2021-2023 financial outlookRevenue guidanceSales outlook is confirmed at minimum 3% organic sales CAGR over 2021-23FY 2023 organic sales growth is expected c.3%.Current EBIT2 guidanceCurrent EBIT 2 outlook is confirmed at minimum mid-single digit organic 6 current EBIT 2 CAGR over 2021-23outlook is confirmed at minimum mid-single digit organic current EBIT CAGR over 2021-23 FY 2023 organic growth in current EBIT2 is expected at c.10%.In terms of the organic revenue growth  FY 2023 is expected to benefit from the positive trend in Annual Recurring Revenue for Intelligent Communication Automation  which grew at +22% organically in FY 2022 and is expected to translate into a similar level of subscription-related revenue growth in FY 2023. In addition  solid cross-selling and upselling dynamics should also continue to drive growth in future bookings. As the weight of licenses sales continues to decrease  growth for Intelligent Communication Automation is expected to gradually move closer to the subscription-related revenue growth.After two remarkable years of organic growth for Mail-Related Solutions  driven by solid hardware placements and some benefits from price increases  the outlook for FY 2023 is cautiously optimistic thanks to further benefits from price increases and further upgrade of the installed base.Parcel Locker Solutions should deliver strong organic growth in FY 2023 supported by the rising contribution of the larger installed base as well as some catch up in installations in the US following the delays recorded in FY 2022 in the residential and retail sectors.Turning to the current EBIT2  the improvement in profitability is expected to be driven by:i) The rising profitability of the installed base for both the SaaS activity and parcel lockers ii) Continued improvement in current EBIT(1) for Intelligent Communication Automation as the transition to SaaS is almost completed  significant increase in current EBIT2 expected for Parcel Locker Solutions driven by acceleration of locker placements  whilst Mail-Related Solutions current EBIT2 margin should remain high thanks to careful price control  andiii) Lower freight costs.However  salary inflation is expected to continue.BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTSQuadient launches Parcel Pending smart lockers in Ireland to support on-going modernization of the residential property industryOn 8 November 2022  Quadient announced the launch of Parcel Pending by Quadient in Ireland.

All of the Group's businesses grew in 2022  with the exception of one in the Products division (Cristal dental prosthesis laboratory).Revenues in the Systems division rose by +12%  supported by both sales of machines and materials for the dental sector and by the Software activityRevenues in the Products division increased by 17%  thanks to a mix of organic growth and external growth with the acquisition of Auditech.More details are available in the dedicated press release of February 15  2023 (link).+29% growth in current EBITDAProdways Group generated a current EBITDA of €11.4 million in 2022  up sharply by +29% compared to 2021. This improvement in profitability is due in particular to the full-year effect of the reorganization work completed during 2021 and the increase in activity. This is Prodways' best annual performance and illustrates the group's relevant business model.The current EBITDA margin was 14%  the highest level achieved by Prodways. It was 1 pt below the guidance range indicated at the time of the half-year results  due in particular to the slowdown in the activity of direct supply of products and services for dental practitioners (Cristal laboratory  which now represents less than 4% of revenues). This activity experienced a significant slowdown in the second half of the year (including the failure of its first customer at the end of the year)  and its revenues fell by 16% in 2022. This first client is currently the subject of a recovery plan and could therefore generate revenues again in 2023. As a reminder  this failure only concerns the dental laboratory activity. It does not affect the sales of 3D printers and materials for the dental sector  which continue to perform very well.Significant improvement in operating incomeThanks to the growth in revenues and the improvement in the EBITDA margin  the operating result increased both in the Systems division (+0.4 M€) and in the Products division (+1.1 M€).The Group's operating profit  after taking into account non-recurring items of €0.9m  thus amounted to €4.9m  almost three times the previous year's figure.The consolidated financial statements are available in the appendix at the end of this press release.Results by division [3](in €million) FY 2021 FY 2022 Change(€m) Change(%) Systems Revenues 43 9 49 3 +5 4 +12% Current EBITDA 6 9 8 2 +1 3 +18% Current EBITDA margin (%) 15 8% 16 6% 0 9 pts - Income from ordinary activities 5 2 5 6 +0 4 +9% Products Revenues 26 9 31 7 +4 7 +18% Current EBITDA 2 8 4 3 +1 5 +53% Current EBITDA margin (%) 10 4% 13 5% 3 2 pts - Income from ordinary activities -0 1 1 1 +1 3 n.aA significant change in seasonality by semesterThe level of profitability by semester has changed significantly in the Systems division  essentially due to the effect of anticipation during Q1 2022 by certain customers fearing possible stock-outs or price increases in the future. This concerns the Software and Materials activities  the most profitable of the group.A significant increase in cash-flow from operations of +71%.Prodways Group's cash flow from operations[4] has risen sharply in 2022  now exceeding €10 million (compared with €5.9 million in 2021). This very favorable trend reflects Prodways' financial health and is a key factor in financing growth in the coming years.This performance is partially offset by the higher-than-normal change in working capital requirements of +4.4 M€ in 2022. This increase is explained by an increase in inventories as a precautionary measure for production needs  as well as the impact of the change in seasonality in the Software activity. The level of working capital is already starting to decrease at the beginning of 2023.As a result  Prodways Group's financial position once again reflects the discipline the group has demonstrated for many years. With €14 million in available cash  net debt stands at a healthy level of €3.4 million  compared to a positive net cash position of €1.3 million at the end of 2021  notably due to the acquisition of Auditech in 2022.Outlook: Prodways accelerates in a market of opportunities with a strategic plan for 2028A new phase in Prodways' developmentProdways Group was formed in 2013 with a single employee and a turnover of €0.1 m. After a build-up phase until 2017  which was marked by investments in 3D Materials and Digital Manufacturing (print-on-demand)  the group had €35 m in sales  a negative EBITDA of €1 m and 375 employees. The consolidation phase that followed has established Prodways as a leading player in 3D printing  with 480 employees  and among the most profitable in the world in the sector.This year  Prodways is embarking on a new phase of development aimed at achieving strong revenue growth in a favorable market environment. The adoption of 3D printing is progressing in incremental phases in various applications  driven by underlying trends: the interest of industrial players for near-shoring  the need to bring products to market ever more quickly and the environmental crisis  which favors more responsible production methods. More specifically  3D printing applications are well oriented and offer significant growth opportunities  whether in established 3D applications such as orthodontics  or for applications in transition such as dental  defense  robotics or electric vehicles.A favorable competitive environment for ProdwaysProdways Group is now entering a phase of development and investment in a competitive environment that opens up numerous opportunities for the group. The majority of companies in the sector  essentially American  were not profitable in 2022 with an average EBITDA margin of -35% and a significant cash consumption. In the current context of rising interest rates and the search for profitability  a large number of them have begun a phase of consolidation and cost rationalization with various measures (headcount reduction  reduction of R&D and Sales & Marketing expenses  withdrawal from the European zone  divestment with loss of revenues  diversification into Materials or Software activities  etc.).In this context  Prodways Group is positioning itself to invest and take advantage of numerous market opportunities by pursuing its strategy of growth and profitability. Having completed its consolidation phase in 2021 and demonstrated the profitability of its model  the group now has many assets to benefit from the buoyant 3D printing market:A differentiating technology: MovingLight®  combining precision and productivity  capable for example of printing 55 dental models per hour with a precision of 40 microns. An ability to acquire and retain prestigious customers thanks to the quality of its products  including Straumann Group  Salomon  Somfy  Aéroports de Paris  etc. Expertise in certification and compliance with the regulatory frameworks of different areas of the world for its materials and products (MDSAP  FDA  CE  MDR). The company was one of the first in Europe to obtain compliance with the new European Medical Device Regulation. A profitable business model  supported by a base of recurring revenues (~65% of revenues)New printer orders in early 2023 and significant opportunities beyondProdways' strong positioning continues to materialize in early 2023 in the alignment trays market  which continues to attract investment from major industrial players. In February 2023  Prodways Group once again strengthened its partnership with a world leader in the distribution of medical and dental products. This major industrial project  initiated in 2020 and won at the end of 2021  had already resulted in an additional order of 6 printers in 2022  now completed by an additional order of 3 MovingLight LD20 printers. This customer will thus operate a fleet of 17 MovingLight printers consuming PLASTCure Absolute Aligner resin for the mass production of transparent alignment trays.Inspired by this application  other players are now planning to benefit from the mass production possibilities of 3D printing. Today  several customers from different sectors (dental  medical  industrial  automotive) are in preliminary discussions with Prodways for medium-term projects. In total  they represent nearly one hundred printers for medium-term mass production  representing a consumption of more than one hundred tons of 3D materials per year.Prodways' ambition for 2028 thanks to the new BOOST strategic planThe BOOST strategic plan to 2028 aims to develop the group's revenues across all its activities  while maintaining double-digit profitability. The plan aims to engage customers in ambitious long-term industrial projects  strengthen commercial efforts to accelerate organic growth  pursue targeted investments in R&D and accelerate development through targeted acquisitions.New initiatives are already being rolled out in 2023 to pave the way for future years  including:Strengthening the teams with 80 new hires planned in 2023  particularly in Sales & Marketing.The launch of new materials and innovative products  such as the new Provivic Denture Base resin for the 3D printing of complete and partial denture bases  announced in March 2023 (link to the dedicated press release).New R&D projects  in partnership with customers  to meet their needs.Preparations for the expansion of certain production sites in order to meet current production challenges  with ~€2M of capex identified over the next two years.Guidance 2023In view of the positive trend in its activities  Prodways Group has set itself a revenue growth target of around +10% in 2023  excluding new potential acquisitions.The Group's profitability  although incorporating efforts linked to investments under the BOOST plan  is expected to improve compared to the second half of 2022  to reach a current EBITDA margin of around 12%.In addition  the sale of a minority stake could take place in the near future  with a very significant capital gain (a few million euros). This sale would make an important contribution to the results for the year 2023.About Prodways GroupProdways Group is a specialist in industrial and professional 3D printing with a unique positioning as an integrated European player.

The article is a comprehensive and critical review of research published to date on the enzymatic degradation of all types of plastics (PET  PLA  polyolefins  polyurethanes  polyamides) and includes almost 700 references. Co-authored by biotechnology researchers from Carbios and its academic partner Toulouse Biotechnology Institute (TBI)  as well as two eminent professors in polymer science from the University of Bordeaux  the work brings together expertise in the fields of enzymology  polymer science and industry in order to accelerate the transition to a circular economy for plastic.Beyond the comprehensive bibliographical study  the authors analyzed the data to discuss the scope  limitations  challenges and opportunities of enzymatic plastic recycling with a view to developing innovations and industrial processes. The article’s unique standpoint and added value with regard to issues surrounding plastic pollution is its critical view on technology transfer and industrial scalability.""Any new scientific research project begins with an exhaustive bibliographical study  as we did for our PET biorecycling and PLA biodegradation technologies. Today  Carbios is the most advanced company in the industrialization of its PET biorecycling technology "" commented Alain Marty  Chief Scientific Officer at Carbios. ""Carbios' mission is to bring all types of plastics into the circular economy. I am therefore very proud to have collaborated with our long-term partner TBI  as well as with new partners at the University of Bordeaux  on the article published in Chemical Reviews which will serve as the basis for research into biological recycling solutions for other polymers.”""Following the invitation to write an article for the upcoming Thematic Issue of Chemical Reviews  we collaborated once more with Carbios. In line with the subject 'Bridging the Gaps: Learning from Catalysis across Boundaries'  our collaboration goes beyond the boundaries of plastics and polymer science in order to consider industrial feasibility  and find new solutions for different polymers using biocatalysis "" said Isabelle André  Research Director at CNRS. ""As a researcher  it is always gratifying and rewarding to see the fruit of hard work published in a prestigious journal  and I congratulate all the researchers involved.”To read the article in Chemical Reviews  click here : https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.chemrev.2c00644Publication has been scheduled for the upcoming Thematic Issue “Bridging the Gaps: Learning from Catalysis across Boundaries”.Author(s): Tournier  Vincent (Carbios) ; Duquesne  Sophie (TBI) ; Guillamot  Frédérique (Carbios) ; Cramail  Henri (Université Bordeaux); Taton  Daniel (Université Bordeaux); Marty  Alain (Carbios); André  Isabelle (TBI)About CarbiosEstablished in 2011 by Truffle Capital  Carbios is a green chemistry company  developing biological and innovative processes. Through its unique approach of combining enzymes and plastics  Carbios aims to address new consumer expectations and the challenges of a broad ecological transition by taking up a major challenge of our time: plastic and textile pollution. Carbios deconstructs any type of PET (the dominant polymer in bottles  trays  textiles made of polyester) into its basic components which can then be reused to produce new PET plastics with equivalent quality to virgin ones. This PET innovation  the first of its kind in the world  was recently recognized in a scientific paper published on the front cover of the prestigious journal Nature. Carbios successfully started up its demonstration plant in Clermont-Ferrand in 2021. It has now taken another key step towards the industrialization of its process with the construction of a first-of-a-kind unit in partnership with Indorama Ventures.In 2017  Carbios and L’Oréal co-founded a consortium to contribute to the industrialization of its proprietary recycling technology. Committed to developing innovative solutions for sustainable development  Nestlé Waters  PepsiCo and Suntory Beverage & Food Europe joined this consortium in April 2019. In 2022  Carbios signed an agreement with On  Patagonia  PUMA  and Salomon  to develop solutions promoting the recyclability and circularity of their products. PVH Corp. joined this consortium in January 2023.The Company has also developed an enzymatic biodegradation technology for PLA-based (a bio sourced polymer) single-use plastics. This technology can create a new generation of plastics that are 100% compostable in domestic conditions  integrating enzymes at the heart of the plastic product.For more information  please visit www.carbios.com/en / Twitter: Carbios LinkedIn: Carbios Instagram: insidecarbiosCarbios (ISIN FR0011648716/ALCRB) is eligible for the PEA-PME  a government program allowing French residents investing in SMEs to benefit from income tax rebates.Translation is for information purposes only.In case of discrepancy between the French and the English version of this press release  the French version shall prevail1 Toulouse Biotechnology Institute  joint research unit associating INSA of Toulouse  CNRS and INRAEView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230321005849/en/CARBIOSMelissa FlauraudPress Relationsmelissa.flauraud@carbios.comBenjamin AudebertInvestor Relationscontact@carbios.com+33 (0)4 73 86 51 76Press Relations (Europe)IconicMarie-Virginie Kleinmvk@iconic-conseil.com+33 (0)1 44 14 99 96Press Relations (U.S.)Rooney PartnersKate L.

By,"WALLIX and Kleverware  the European pioneer and specialist in access and digital identity governance  have signed a technological alliance to strengthen the security of cloud infrastructures.By integrating their technologies  WALLIX and Kleverware offer a complete CIEM (Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management) solution that maps  manages  and secures all access - human or machine - to IT resources used by organizations' cloud services.As a result  WALLIX and Kleverware ensure the protection of data hosted in the cloud  detection and resilience to cyberattacks  business continuity of cloud services  and compliance with cybersecurity regulations.Paris  March 28  2023 - WALLIX  (Euronext ALLIX) a European cybersecurity software provider and expert in digital access and identity solutions  and Kleverware  the European pioneer and specialist in digital access and identity governance  have signed a technological alliance to strengthen the security of cloud infrastructures. By integrating their technologies  WALLIX and Kleverware offer a complete solution that maps  manages  and secures all access - whether human or machine - to IT resources (data  software…) used by cloud services (applications  storage…) subscribed by organizations. Thus  WALLIX and Kleverware ensure the protection of data hosted in the cloud  the detection and resilience to cyberattacks  the business continuity of cloud services  and compliance with cybersecurity regulations.Cloud services are booming...With the pandemic  organizations around the world have experienced an acceleration of their digital transformation. To ensure business continuity  organizations have turned  among other things  to cloud services that enable remote and collaborative work (data storage and sharing  software accessible from a web application  etc.). After the pandemic  the use of cloud services has become widespread. Indeed  cloud services offer many advantages in addition to facilitating remote work: agility  flexibility  cost reduction  and performance. Consequently  the market for cloud services is booming. According to the analyst firm Gartner  this market is growing by more than 20% over last year and is estimated to be worth $600 billion by 2023.... but increase the cyber risk for organizationsThis massive increase in the use of cloud services considerably increases the cyber risk for organizations. Indeed  by using a cloud provider - several in the context of a multi-cloud policy - organizations multiply the locations where their often-critical IT resources are located. And the fact that there are so many locations makes it essential to protect the access of users of these cloud services (employees  suppliers  customers  partners  terminals  connected objects  applications  etc.). Moreover  to implement  operate  and maintain these cloud services  the number of users - human or machine - who have access to the cloud provider's IT infrastructures  and therefore to the organizations' resources  is numerous. This represents a multitude of access that must be managed to ensure that no user can access more resources than necessary. This drastically reduces the risk of malicious intent and prevents the spread of a cyberattack in the event of identity theft.The answer: Combining the skills of WALLIX and Kleverware to offer a complete solutionWithout an appropriate solution  access rights management becomes a real headache for organizations. This is why WALLIX  an expert in PAM (Privileged Access Management)  and Kleverware  an expert in IAG (Identity & Access Governance)  combine their skills to offer organizations a CIEM (Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management) solution.This solution will continuously monitor the access rights of users who have access to cloud infrastructure resources. It will make it possible to know who is authorized to access what  from where  and why. And  above all  it will ensure that users have the rights they are supposed to have  according to their profile. In particular  it will:Map the resources in the cloudVisualize the users of these resources and their access rightsIdentify sensitive users (privileged accounts) and secure their accessRecord sessions of sensitive users to guarantee the traceability of their actionsApply the principle of least privilege for all other users (minimum permissions required to perform their predefined tasks)Ensure that users are authorized to perform the task according to their profile and for a given periodTrigger an alert in case of suspected identity theft or internal maliciousness and cut off accessWALLIX and Kleverware thus help organizations to strengthen cloud cybersecurity based on robust governance of digital identities and access while ensuring regulatory compliance (RGPD  NIS2…).""With this strategic alliance  recognized experts in their respective fields naturally join forces so that organizations can accelerate their digital transformation.
