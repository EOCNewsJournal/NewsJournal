Following implementation of the Programmes  the Board of Directors intends to carry out an evaluation thereof in order to systematically analyse the achieved results in relation to the aims outlined above. The aim of the evaluation will be to determine whether the Programmes satisfies their purposes  and this will also include a review of the outcome and the costs for the Programmes.A. Implementation of the ProgrammesThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting 2023 resolves on implementation of the Programmes in accordance with the principal terms and conditions set out below:I. The Management ProgrammeIt is proposed that the Management Programme be open to no more than 341 permanent employees of the Sobi Group  whereof no more than 270 employees on director level of the Sobi Group (""Band D"")  no more than 40 employees on vice president level of the Sobi Group (""Band C"")  no more than 15 pre-selected key employees of the Sobi Group (""Band B2"")  no more than 15 employees who are members of the Executive Committee of the Sobi Group (""Band B1"") and the CEO of Sobi (""CEO"")  on the following terms and conditions and the terms and conditions set out in item A.III below.Performance sharesa) Each participant in Band D  Band C  Band B2  Band B1 and the CEO will free of charge receive a performance share award under the Management Programme (""LTIP Award"") entitling the participant to receive an allocation of a number of Sobi common shares free of charge from Sobi or from a designated third party  subject to the satisfaction of the condition in section e) below as well as the satisfaction of the performance conditions set out in section c) below (""Management Performance Shares""). Any Management Performance Shares will be allocated after the expiration of the three-year vesting period beginning on the date that Sobi starts inviting the employees in Band D  Band C  Band B2  Band B1 and the CEO to participate in the Management Programme (the ""Vesting Period""). Sobi must invite the employees in Band D  Band C  Band B2  Band B1 and the CEO to participate in the Management Programme no later than on 31 December 2023.b) The value of the underlying shares at the time of grant in respect of each LTIP Award will amount to (i) 150% of the gross annual fixed salary in 2023 for the CEO  (ii) 75% of the gross annual fixed salary in 2023 for each Band B1 participant  on an individual basis  (iii) 75% of the gross annual fixed salary in 2023 for each Band B2 participant  on an individual basis  (iv) the sum of 37.5% of the average gross annual fixed salary in 2023 for Band C participants and 37.5% of the gross annual fixed salary in 2023 for each Band C participant  on an individual basis  and (v) 35% of the average gross annual fixed salary in 2023 for Band D participants. The share price used to calculate the value of the underlying shares in respect of each LTIP Award  and hence the number of shares to which each LTIP Award entitles  shall be the volume-weighted average price paid for the Sobi common share on Nasdaq Stockholm  adjusted for any dividend payments  during a period of ten trading days in connection with the commencement of the Vesting Period.c) The portion (if any) of an LTIP Award that will vest at the end of the Vesting Period is based on and subject to the satisfaction of the following performance conditions:Absolute TSR[1] increase60% of an LTIP Award granted to a participant will be subject to satisfaction of certain levels of absolute TSR increase over the Vesting Period. In order for any vesting related to absolute TSR increase to occur  the TSR must increase by more than 10% over the Vesting Period. In order for full vesting related to absolute TSR increase to occur  the TSR must increase by at least 40% over the Vesting Period. If the TSR increase is between 10% and 40% over the Vesting Period  a linear vesting related to absolute TSR increase will occur. The calculation of the TSR shall for the purpose of the TSR performance condition be based on a comparison of the volume-weighted average price paid for the Sobi common share on Nasdaq Stockholm  adjusted for any dividend payments  during a period of ten trading days in connection with the start of the Vesting Period and the volume-weighted average price paid for the Sobi common share on Nasdaq Stockholm  adjusted for any dividend payments  during the last ten trading days of the Vesting Period.Annual revenues40% of an LTIP Award granted to a participant will be subject to the Sobi Group's actual annual revenues reaching or exceeding the Sobi Group's target annual revenues for the Management Programme as set by the Board of Directors each year. A comparison shall be made for each of the financial years 2023  2024 and 2025. If the threshold is reached or exceeded for a financial year  full vesting related to annual revenues in respect of that financial year will occur (i.e. 1/3 of 40%). If the threshold is not reached for a financial year  no vesting related to annual revenues in respect of that financial year will occur.d) Management Performance Shares may be allocated only after the expiration of the Vesting Period  unless the Board of Directors of Sobi in an individual case resolves otherwise.e) In order for a Management Programme participant to be allocated Management Performance Shares it is a condition that  with certain specific exemptions  he/she has been permanently employed within the Sobi Group for the duration of the whole Vesting Period.f) If significant changes in the Sobi Group or in the market occur which  in the opinion of the Board of Directors  would result in a situation where the conditions for allocation of Management Performance Shares become unreasonable  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to make adjustments to the Management Programme  including  among other things  be entitled to resolve on a reduced allocation of Management Performance Shares  or that no Management Performance Shares shall be allocated at all.Employee stock optionsa) In addition to the LTIP Award  the CEO as well as Band B1 and Band B2 participants (approximately 31 employees in total) shall free of charge be awarded employee stock options (""Options"").b) The Options shall not be deemed securities and shall be non-transferable.c) The Options shall be awarded as soon as possible after the Annual General Meeting 2023. For new employees awards may take place at a later point in time but no later than on 31 December 2023.d) Each Option shall entitle the holder to acquire one Sobi common share (""Option Share"") at a strike price equivalent to 105% of the volume-weighted average price paid for the Sobi common share at Nasdaq Stockholm  adjusted for any dividend payments  during a period of ten trading days in connection with the commencement of the Vesting Period (the ""Strike price""). The Strike Price shall be rounded to the nearest SEK 0.01  whereby SEK 0.005 shall be rounded upwards. The Strike price and the number of Option Shares that may be acquired for each Option will be subject to recalculation as a result of intervening bonus issues  splits  rights issues and/or other similar corporate events.e) The value of each award of Options will amount to (i) 150% of the gross annual fixed salary in 2023 for the CEO  (ii) 75% of the gross annual fixed salary in 2023 for each Band B1 participant  on an individual basis and (iii) 75% of the gross annual fixed salary in 2023 for for each Band B2 participant  on an individual basis. The valuation of the Options will be carried out pursuant to Black & Scholes. The aggregate number of Options awarded will not exceed 1 647 605 and amount to:CEO: no more than 266 648 Options.Band B1: no more than between 28 491 and 93 128 Options per person  depending on the size of the gross annual fixed salary in 2023.Band B2: no more than between 15 669 and 59 501 Options per person  depending on the size of the gross annual fixed salary in 2023.f) Each holder of Options shall be entitled to exercise the Options as from the third anniversary of the award date  up to and including the fifth anniversary of the award date (""Exercise Period"")  subject to satisfaction of the condition in section h) below as well as the satisfaction of the performance condition set out in section g) below. In accordance with customary terms and conditions  it shall be possible to exercise the Options prematurely in the event of  inter alia  compulsory redemption of shares  liquidation or merger.g) The vesting of Options will be subject to the Sobi Group's actual average revenues reaching or exceeding the Sobi Group's average target revenues for the Management Programme as set by the Board of Directors each year over the financial years 2023-2025. If the threshold is reached or exceeded  full vesting of Options will occur. If the threshold is not reached  no vesting of Options will occur.h) In order for a Management Programme participant to be eligible to exercise Options it is a condition that  with certain specific exemptions  he/she has been permanently employed within the Sobi Group from the start of the Vesting Period up until the time of exercise of Options.i) If significant changes in the Sobi Group or in the market occur which would result in a situation where the Board of Directors considers the number of Options subject to exercise to be unreasonable  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to reduce the number of Options subject to exercise. Such reduction may result in the number of Options subject to exercise being reduced to zero. Further  the value of each Sobi common share received upon exercise of Options shall be capped to three times the Strike price  meaning that the number of Sobi common shares delivered to Management Program participants upon exercise of Options may be reduced.II. The All Employee ProgrammeIt is proposed that the All Employee Programme be open to approximately 825 permanent employees of the Sobi Group (""Employees"")  on the following terms and conditions and the terms and conditions set out in item A.III below.a) The All Employee Programme will require Employees to make investments of their own in common shares in Sobi on Nasdaq Stockholm (""Employee Investment Shares""). For each Employee Investment Share  the Employees will have the possibility to be allocated two common shares in Sobi free of charge (""Employee Matching Shares"")  from Sobi or from a designated third party. The Employee Matching Shares will be allocated following expiration of the three-year vesting period beginning on the date that Sobi starts inviting the Employees to participate in the All Employee Programme (the ""Vesting Period""). Sobi must invite the Employees to participate in the All Employee Programme no later than on 31 December 2023.b) The maximum number of Employee Investment Shares each Employee may invest in depends on the gross annual average fixed salary for Employees in 2023. Employee Investment Shares may be acquired for an amount corresponding to no more than 2.5% of the gross annual average fixed salary for Employees in 2023.c) All Employee Programme participants must purchase Employee Investment Shares in connection with the start of the Vesting Period.d) Employee Matching Shares may be allocated only after the expiration of the Vesting Period  unless the Board of Directors of Sobi in an individual case resolves otherwise.e) In order for an All Employee Programme participant to be allocated Employee Matching Shares it is a condition that  with certain specific exemptions  he/she has been permanently employed within the Sobi Group for the duration of the whole Vesting Period and that the participant  until the expiration of this Vesting Period  has retained the Employee Investment Shares purchased. Any disposal of Employee Investment Shares prior to the expiration of the Vesting Period will generally result in no Employee Matching Shares being allocated.III. Terms and conditions applying to the Management Programme and the All Employee Programmea) The Board of Directors shall be authorised to establish the detailed terms and conditions for the Programmes. The Board of Directors may  in that regard  make necessary or appropriate adjustments to satisfy certain regulations or market conditions outside Sweden  including  among other things  to offer cash settlement.b) Participation in the Programmes presupposes that such participation is legally possible in the various jurisdictions concerned and that the administrative costs and financial efforts are reasonable in the opinion of the Board of Directors.c) The Programmes shall jointly comprise no more than 4 038 431 common shares in Sobi  of which 1 413 067 constitute Management Performance Shares  1 647 605 constitute Option Shares and 143 550 constitute Employee Matching Shares. The remaining 834 209 common shares in Sobi are such shares that may be transferred by Sobi in order to cover the cash flow effects associated with the Programmes  primarily social security charges.d) The number of Employee Matching Shares  Option Shares and Management Performance Shares  will be subject to recalculation as a result of intervening bonus issues  splits  rights issues and/or other similar corporate events.Costs for the Programmes etc.The costs for the Programmes  which are charged in the profit and loss account  are calculated according to the accounting standard IFRS 2 and distributed on a linear basis over the Vesting Period. The calculation has been made based on the following assumptions: (i) a market price of the Sobi common share of SEK 234  (ii) no dividend is paid by Sobi during the Programmes  (iii) an assessment of future volatility in respect of the Sobi common share  (iv) full vesting of Management Performance Shares related to annual revenues will occur  and (v) full vesting of Options. In total  this can lead to maximum costs for the Programmes of approximately SEK 273.9 million  excluding social security costs. The costs for social security charges are calculated to approximately SEK 117.7 million assuming an annual share price increase of 10% during the Vesting Period. In addition to what is set forth above  the maximum costs for the Programmes have been based on a share price of SEK 234 at the time of the commencement of the Vesting Period  that the Programmes comprise 1 166 participants in total  that each All Employee Programme participant makes a maximum investment and based on historical employee turnover for the Sobi Group of 12%. If the share price increases from SEK 234 with 10% until the implementation of the Programmes the effect on costs would only be marginal as the number of Employee Matching Shares  Management Performance Shares and Option Shares would be reduced correspondingly. Also in case of a decrease in the share price the effect on costs would be marginal. Based on the assumptions above the annual costs for the Programmes  including social security charges  corresponds to approximately 3.6% of Sobi's total annual employee costs.If the Programmes had been implemented in 2022  if the company had had costs in accordance with the example in the preceding paragraph  and Employee Matching Shares  Management Performance Shares and Option Shares had been allocated in 2022 in accordance with the assumptions in the sample calculation  which among other things assumes an annual share price increase of 10% during the Vesting Period  the earnings per share for the financial year 2022 had decreased by SEK 0.47 to SEK 8.45 and the shareholders' equity per share for the financial year 2022 had decreased by SEK 1.18 to SEK 84.42.DilutionUpon full allocation of Employee Matching Shares  Management Performance Shares and Option Shares  the number of shares under the Programmes amounts to 3 204 222 common shares in Sobi  corresponding to a dilution effect of approximately 1.07% of the share capital and the votes. Aggregated with the 834 209 shares that may be transferred in order to cover the cash flow effects associated with the Programmes  primarily social security charges  the maximum dilution effect of the Programmes amounts to approximately 1.34% of the share capital and the votes. If all outstanding long-term incentive programmes are included in the calculation  then the corresponding maximum level of dilution amounts to 4.57%.Hedging arrangementsThe Board of Directors has considered different methods for transfer of shares under the Programmes  in order to implement the Programmes in a cost-effective and flexible manner. The Board of Directors has found the most cost-effective alternative to be  and thus proposes that the Annual General Meeting as a main alternative  with separate resolutions for the Management Programme and the All Employee Programme  resolves on (i) a directed issue of redeemable and convertible series C shares and (ii) an authorisation for the Board of Directors to resolve on the repurchase of all issued redeemable and convertible series C shares. Following conversion to common shares in Sobi  the shares are intended to be transferred to the participants of the Programmes as well as transferred on a regulated market in order to cover the cash flow effects associated with the Programmes  primarily social security charges. For this purpose  the Board of Directors further proposes that the Annual General Meeting  with separate resolutions for the Management Programme and the All Employee Programme  resolves (iii) on transfers of own common shares free of charge to the participants of the Programmes. As further described in item B.I.iii) and B.II.iii)  respectively  below  the Board of Directors proposes that shares acquired for the purpose of securing Sobi's obligations under previous incentive programmes also may be transferred under the Programmes. The detailed conditions for the Board of Directors' main alternative are set out in item B.I and B.II  respectively  below.Since the Programmes  in principle  are not expected to give rise to any initial social security payments for the Sobi Group  the Board of Directors has decided not to propose to the Annual General Meeting 2023 to resolve on transfers of own common shares on a regulated market in order to cover such payments. However  prior to the transfers of common shares to the participants of the Programmes  the Board of Directors intends to propose to the Annual General Meeting 2025 that transfers be made of own common shares on a regulated market in order to cover such costs.Should the majority required under item B.I or B.II below not be reached  the Board of Directors proposes that Sobi shall be able to enter into an equity swap agreement with a third party  in accordance with item C. below.Preparations of the proposalThe Compensation & Benefits Committee of Sobi has prepared guidelines for the proposed Programmes. These guidelines have been presented for and adopted by the Board of Directors.The Board of Directors has established shareholding guidelines which recommend that the CEO and other members of the Executive Committee (Band B1 participants) accumulate personal holdings in Sobi shares representing a value of an annual gross base salary for the CEO and 50% of an annual gross base salary for other members of the Executive Committee  by maintaining Sobi shares already held as well as Sobi shares allocated under the Programmes and under previous incentive programmes. It is recommended that the personal holding of shares is established within three years from being appointed Executive Committee Member. It is recommended that the CEO and other Executive Committee members maintain shares of such a value for the duration of their appointment as CEO or other Executive Committee member.Hedging arrangements in respect of the ProgrammesB. Directed issue of redeemable and convertible series C shares  authorisation for the Board of Directors to resolve to repurchase all issued redeemable and convertible series C shares and transfers of own common shares to the participants of the ProgrammesI. Management Programmei) Resolution on a directed issue of redeemable and convertible series C sharesIncrease of Sobi's share capital by no more than SEK 840 624.46 through an issue of no more than 1 532 014 series C shares in Sobi.

The reason for the proposed possibility to repurchase own shares is that Sobi shall be able to fulfil its obligations pursuant to the All Employee Programme in a cost-effective manner.iii) Resolution on transfers of own common shares to the participants of the All Employee ProgrammeThe Board of Directors proposes that the shares issued and repurchased in accordance with items B.II.i) and B.II.ii) above  following conversion to common shares  may be transferred under the All Employee Programme.Transfers of Sobi's own common shares to the participants of the All Employee Programme may be made on the following terms:a) Transfers may be made only of common shares in Sobi  whereby a maximum of 143 550 common shares in Sobi (all Employee Matching Shares) may be transferred free of charge to participants of the All Employee Programme.b) Right to purchase common shares in Sobi free of charge shall ‚Äì with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights ‚Äì be granted to such persons within the Sobi Group who are participants in the All Employee Programme.c) Transfers of common shares in Sobi shall be made free of charge at the time and on the other terms that the All Employee Programme's participants are entitled to be allocated shares.d) The number of common shares in Sobi that may be transferred under the All Employee Programme will be subject to recalculation as a result of intervening bonus issues  splits  rights issues and/or other similar corporate events.C. Equity swap agreement with a third partyShould the majority required under item B.I and/or B.II above not be reached  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves that the expected financial exposure of the Management Programme (if the required majority is not obtained for item B.I) and/or the All Employee Programme (of the required majority is not obtained for item B.II) shall be hedged by Sobi being able to enter into an equity swap agreement with a third party on terms in accordance with market practice  whereby the third party in its own name shall be entitled to acquire and transfer common shares in Sobi to participants of the Programmes.ConditionsThe Annual General Meeting's resolution on the implementation of the Management Programme according to item A.I above is conditional upon the Annual General Meeting either resolving in accordance with the Board of Directors' proposal under item B.I above or in accordance with the Board of Directors' proposal under item C above  and the Annual General Meeting's resolution on the implementation of the All Employee Program according to item A.II above  is conditional upon the Annual General Meeting either resolving in accordance with the Board of Directors' proposal under item B.II above or in accordance with the Board of Directors' proposal under item C. above.Majority requirements  etc.Each of the Annual General Meeting's resolutions according to item A.I and item A.II above requires a simple majority of the votes cast. A valid resolution under item B.I above and B.II above respectively  requires that shareholders representing not less than nine-tenths of the votes cast as well as of the shares represented at the Annual General Meeting approve the resolution. A valid resolution under item C. above requires a simple majority of the votes cast.The issues  repurchases and transfers of shares in Sobi described above are integral parts of the proposed Programmes. Therefore  and in light of the above  the Board of Directors considers it to be advantageous for Sobi and the shareholders that the Programmes' participants are invited to become shareholders in Sobi.For the purpose of minimising Sobi's costs for the Programmes  the subscription price has been set at the quotient value of the share.Previous incentive programmes in SobiFor a description of the company's other long-term incentive programmes  reference is made to the company's annual report for 2022  note 10  and the company's website  www.sobi.com.

Such resolution may provide for payment in kind  payment against set-off of claims and/or on other conditions. The number of shares that may be issued  the number of shares that convertible bonds may be converted into and the number of shares that may be subscribed for by the exercise of warrants may not exceed 34 400 000 shares in total.If the authorisation is exercised in full  the dilution would amount to approximately 10% of the number of shares in the company (counted after the authorisation has been fully exercised).The Board of Directors  or any person appointed by it  is authorised to make any minor adjustments to the resolution that may be necessary to enable registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.Majority requirements  etc.The purpose of the authorisation is to enable payment through the issuance of own financial instruments in connection with possible transactions that the company may make as well as to raise capital in order to finance completed or future transactions that the company may make.

A division into two parts is proposed: (I) one part directed to managers and executives (the ""Management Programme"") and (II) one part directed to all other employees (the ""All Employee Programme""  jointly with the Management Programme  the ""Programmes"")  with separate resolutions on each part.The overall purpose of the Programmes is to closely align the employees' interests with those of the shareholders and to create a long-term commitment to Sobi. The Management Programme provides Sobi with a crucial component of a competitive total remuneration package with which to attract and retain executives who are critical to Sobi's long-term success. The purpose of the All Employee Programme is to create commitment and motivation for the entire permanent workforce of the Sobi Group. For these reasons the Board of Directors considers that having recurring long-term incentive programmes is a vital and important part of Sobi's total remuneration package.The Board of Directors of Sobi has evaluated the long-term incentive programmes approved by the Annual General Meeting 2022 and has concluded that the All Employee Programme as well as the Management Programme work well and satisfy the intended purposes.Similar to the incentive programmes approved by the Annual General Meeting 2022  the Programmes shall be inspiring  achievable  easy to understand  cost effective to administer  easy to communicate and in line with market practice. Following implementation of the Programmes  the Board of Directors intends to carry out an evaluation thereof in order to systematically analyse the achieved results in relation to the aims outlined above. The aim of the evaluation will be to determine whether the Programmes satisfies their purposes  and this will also include a review of the outcome and the costs for the Programmes.A. Implementation of the ProgrammesThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting 2023 resolves on implementation of the Programmes in accordance with the principal terms and conditions set out below:I. The Management ProgrammeIt is proposed that the Management Programme be open to no more than 341 permanent employees of the Sobi Group  whereof no more than 270 employees on director level of the Sobi Group (""Band D"")  no more than 40 employees on vice president level of the Sobi Group (""Band C"")  no more than 15 pre-selected key employees of the Sobi Group (""Band B2"")  no more than 15 employees who are members of the Executive Committee of the Sobi Group (""Band B1"") and the CEO of Sobi (""CEO"")  on the following terms and conditions and the terms and conditions set out in item A.III below.Performance sharesa) Each participant in Band D  Band C  Band B2  Band B1 and the CEO will free of charge receive a performance share award under the Management Programme (""LTIP Award"") entitling the participant to receive an allocation of a number of Sobi common shares free of charge from Sobi or from a designated third party  subject to the satisfaction of the condition in section e) below as well as the satisfaction of the performance conditions set out in section c) below (""Management Performance Shares""). Any Management Performance Shares will be allocated after the expiration of the three-year vesting period beginning on the date that Sobi starts inviting the employees in Band D  Band C  Band B2  Band B1 and the CEO to participate in the Management Programme (the ""Vesting Period""). Sobi must invite the employees in Band D  Band C  Band B2  Band B1 and the CEO to participate in the Management Programme no later than on 31 December 2023.b) The value of the underlying shares at the time of grant in respect of each LTIP Award will amount to (i) 150% of the gross annual fixed salary in 2023 for the CEO  (ii) 75% of the gross annual fixed salary in 2023 for each Band B1 participant  on an individual basis  (iii) 75% of the gross annual fixed salary in 2023 for each Band B2 participant  on an individual basis  (iv) the sum of 37.5% of the average gross annual fixed salary in 2023 for Band C participants and 37.5% of the gross annual fixed salary in 2023 for each Band C participant  on an individual basis  and (v) 35% of the average gross annual fixed salary in 2023 for Band D participants. The share price used to calculate the value of the underlying shares in respect of each LTIP Award  and hence the number of shares to which each LTIP Award entitles  shall be the volume-weighted average price paid for the Sobi common share on Nasdaq Stockholm  adjusted for any dividend payments  during a period of ten trading days in connection with the commencement of the Vesting Period.c) The portion (if any) of an LTIP Award that will vest at the end of the Vesting Period is based on and subject to the satisfaction of the following performance conditions:Absolute TSR[1] increase60% of an LTIP Award granted to a participant will be subject to satisfaction of certain levels of absolute TSR increase over the Vesting Period. In order for any vesting related to absolute TSR increase to occur  the TSR must increase by more than 10% over the Vesting Period. In order for full vesting related to absolute TSR increase to occur  the TSR must increase by at least 40% over the Vesting Period. If the TSR increase is between 10% and 40% over the Vesting Period  a linear vesting related to absolute TSR increase will occur. The calculation of the TSR shall for the purpose of the TSR performance condition be based on a comparison of the volume-weighted average price paid for the Sobi common share on Nasdaq Stockholm  adjusted for any dividend payments  during a period of ten trading days in connection with the start of the Vesting Period and the volume-weighted average price paid for the Sobi common share on Nasdaq Stockholm  adjusted for any dividend payments  during the last ten trading days of the Vesting Period.Annual revenues40% of an LTIP Award granted to a participant will be subject to the Sobi Group's actual annual revenues reaching or exceeding the Sobi Group's target annual revenues for the Management Programme as set by the Board of Directors each year. A comparison shall be made for each of the financial years 2023  2024 and 2025. If the threshold is reached or exceeded for a financial year  full vesting related to annual revenues in respect of that financial year will occur (i.e. 1/3 of 40%). If the threshold is not reached for a financial year  no vesting related to annual revenues in respect of that financial year will occur.d) Management Performance Shares may be allocated only after the expiration of the Vesting Period  unless the Board of Directors of Sobi in an individual case resolves otherwise.e) In order for a Management Programme participant to be allocated Management Performance Shares it is a condition that  with certain specific exemptions  he/she has been permanently employed within the Sobi Group for the duration of the whole Vesting Period.f) If significant changes in the Sobi Group or in the market occur which  in the opinion of the Board of Directors  would result in a situation where the conditions for allocation of Management Performance Shares become unreasonable  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to make adjustments to the Management Programme  including  among other things  be entitled to resolve on a reduced allocation of Management Performance Shares  or that no Management Performance Shares shall be allocated at all.Employee stock optionsa) In addition to the LTIP Award  the CEO as well as Band B1 and Band B2 participants (approximately 31 employees in total) shall free of charge be awarded employee stock options (""Options"").b) The Options shall not be deemed securities and shall be non-transferable.c) The Options shall be awarded as soon as possible after the Annual General Meeting 2023. For new employees awards may take place at a later point in time but no later than on 31 December 2023.d) Each Option shall entitle the holder to acquire one Sobi common share (""Option Share"") at a strike price equivalent to 105% of the volume-weighted average price paid for the Sobi common share at Nasdaq Stockholm  adjusted for any dividend payments  during a period of ten trading days in connection with the commencement of the Vesting Period (the ""Strike price""). The Strike Price shall be rounded to the nearest SEK 0.01  whereby SEK 0.005 shall be rounded upwards. The Strike price and the number of Option Shares that may be acquired for each Option will be subject to recalculation as a result of intervening bonus issues  splits  rights issues and/or other similar corporate events.e) The value of each award of Options will amount to (i) 150% of the gross annual fixed salary in 2023 for the CEO  (ii) 75% of the gross annual fixed salary in 2023 for each Band B1 participant  on an individual basis and (iii) 75% of the gross annual fixed salary in 2023 for for each Band B2 participant  on an individual basis. The valuation of the Options will be carried out pursuant to Black & Scholes. The aggregate number of Options awarded will not exceed 1 647 605 and amount to:CEO: no more than 266 648 Options.Band B1: no more than between 28 491 and 93 128 Options per person  depending on the size of the gross annual fixed salary in 2023.Band B2: no more than between 15 669 and 59 501 Options per person  depending on the size of the gross annual fixed salary in 2023.f) Each holder of Options shall be entitled to exercise the Options as from the third anniversary of the award date  up to and including the fifth anniversary of the award date (""Exercise Period"")  subject to satisfaction of the condition in section h) below as well as the satisfaction of the performance condition set out in section g) below. In accordance with customary terms and conditions  it shall be possible to exercise the Options prematurely in the event of  inter alia  compulsory redemption of shares  liquidation or merger.g) The vesting of Options will be subject to the Sobi Group's actual average revenues reaching or exceeding the Sobi Group's average target revenues for the Management Programme as set by the Board of Directors each year over the financial years 2023-2025. If the threshold is reached or exceeded  full vesting of Options will occur. If the threshold is not reached  no vesting of Options will occur.h) In order for a Management Programme participant to be eligible to exercise Options it is a condition that  with certain specific exemptions  he/she has been permanently employed within the Sobi Group from the start of the Vesting Period up until the time of exercise of Options.i) If significant changes in the Sobi Group or in the market occur which would result in a situation where the Board of Directors considers the number of Options subject to exercise to be unreasonable  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to reduce the number of Options subject to exercise. Such reduction may result in the number of Options subject to exercise being reduced to zero. Further  the value of each Sobi common share received upon exercise of Options shall be capped to three times the Strike price  meaning that the number of Sobi common shares delivered to Management Program participants upon exercise of Options may be reduced.II. The All Employee ProgrammeIt is proposed that the All Employee Programme be open to approximately 825 permanent employees of the Sobi Group (""Employees"")  on the following terms and conditions and the terms and conditions set out in item A.III below.a) The All Employee Programme will require Employees to make investments of their own in common shares in Sobi on Nasdaq Stockholm (""Employee Investment Shares""). For each Employee Investment Share  the Employees will have the possibility to be allocated two common shares in Sobi free of charge (""Employee Matching Shares"")  from Sobi or from a designated third party. The Employee Matching Shares will be allocated following expiration of the three-year vesting period beginning on the date that Sobi starts inviting the Employees to participate in the All Employee Programme (the ""Vesting Period""). Sobi must invite the Employees to participate in the All Employee Programme no later than on 31 December 2023.b) The maximum number of Employee Investment Shares each Employee may invest in depends on the gross annual average fixed salary for Employees in 2023. Employee Investment Shares may be acquired for an amount corresponding to no more than 2.5% of the gross annual average fixed salary for Employees in 2023.c) All Employee Programme participants must purchase Employee Investment Shares in connection with the start of the Vesting Period.d) Employee Matching Shares may be allocated only after the expiration of the Vesting Period  unless the Board of Directors of Sobi in an individual case resolves otherwise.e) In order for an All Employee Programme participant to be allocated Employee Matching Shares it is a condition that  with certain specific exemptions  he/she has been permanently employed within the Sobi Group for the duration of the whole Vesting Period and that the participant  until the expiration of this Vesting Period  has retained the Employee Investment Shares purchased. Any disposal of Employee Investment Shares prior to the expiration of the Vesting Period will generally result in no Employee Matching Shares being allocated.III. Terms and conditions applying to the Management Programme and the All Employee Programmea) The Board of Directors shall be authorised to establish the detailed terms and conditions for the Programmes. The Board of Directors may  in that regard  make necessary or appropriate adjustments to satisfy certain regulations or market conditions outside Sweden  including  among other things  to offer cash settlement.b) Participation in the Programmes presupposes that such participation is legally possible in the various jurisdictions concerned and that the administrative costs and financial efforts are reasonable in the opinion of the Board of Directors.c) The Programmes shall jointly comprise no more than 4 038 431 common shares in Sobi  of which 1 413 067 constitute Management Performance Shares  1 647 605 constitute Option Shares and 143 550 constitute Employee Matching Shares. The remaining 834 209 common shares in Sobi are such shares that may be transferred by Sobi in order to cover the cash flow effects associated with the Programmes  primarily social security charges.d) The number of Employee Matching Shares  Option Shares and Management Performance Shares  will be subject to recalculation as a result of intervening bonus issues  splits  rights issues and/or other similar corporate events.Costs for the Programmes etc.The costs for the Programmes  which are charged in the profit and loss account  are calculated according to the accounting standard IFRS 2 and distributed on a linear basis over the Vesting Period. The calculation has been made based on the following assumptions: (i) a market price of the Sobi common share of SEK 234  (ii) no dividend is paid by Sobi during the Programmes  (iii) an assessment of future volatility in respect of the Sobi common share  (iv) full vesting of Management Performance Shares related to annual revenues will occur  and (v) full vesting of Options. In total  this can lead to maximum costs for the Programmes of approximately SEK 273.9 million  excluding social security costs. The costs for social security charges are calculated to approximately SEK 117.7 million assuming an annual share price increase of 10% during the Vesting Period. In addition to what is set forth above  the maximum costs for the Programmes have been based on a share price of SEK 234 at the time of the commencement of the Vesting Period  that the Programmes comprise 1 166 participants in total  that each All Employee Programme participant makes a maximum investment and based on historical employee turnover for the Sobi Group of 12%. If the share price increases from SEK 234 with 10% until the implementation of the Programmes the effect on costs would only be marginal as the number of Employee Matching Shares  Management Performance Shares and Option Shares would be reduced correspondingly. Also in case of a decrease in the share price the effect on costs would be marginal. Based on the assumptions above the annual costs for the Programmes  including social security charges  corresponds to approximately 3.6% of Sobi's total annual employee costs.If the Programmes had been implemented in 2022  if the company had had costs in accordance with the example in the preceding paragraph  and Employee Matching Shares  Management Performance Shares and Option Shares had been allocated in 2022 in accordance with the assumptions in the sample calculation  which among other things assumes an annual share price increase of 10% during the Vesting Period  the earnings per share for the financial year 2022 had decreased by SEK 0.47 to SEK 8.45 and the shareholders' equity per share for the financial year 2022 had decreased by SEK 1.18 to SEK 84.42.DilutionUpon full allocation of Employee Matching Shares  Management Performance Shares and Option Shares  the number of shares under the Programmes amounts to 3 204 222 common shares in Sobi  corresponding to a dilution effect of approximately 1.07% of the share capital and the votes. Aggregated with the 834 209 shares that may be transferred in order to cover the cash flow effects associated with the Programmes  primarily social security charges  the maximum dilution effect of the Programmes amounts to approximately 1.34% of the share capital and the votes. If all outstanding long-term incentive programmes are included in the calculation  then the corresponding maximum level of dilution amounts to 4.57%.Hedging arrangementsThe Board of Directors has considered different methods for transfer of shares under the Programmes  in order to implement the Programmes in a cost-effective and flexible manner. The Board of Directors has found the most cost-effective alternative to be  and thus proposes that the Annual General Meeting as a main alternative  with separate resolutions for the Management Programme and the All Employee Programme  resolves on (i) a directed issue of redeemable and convertible series C shares and (ii) an authorisation for the Board of Directors to resolve on the repurchase of all issued redeemable and convertible series C shares. Following conversion to common shares in Sobi  the shares are intended to be transferred to the participants of the Programmes as well as transferred on a regulated market in order to cover the cash flow effects associated with the Programmes  primarily social security charges. For this purpose  the Board of Directors further proposes that the Annual General Meeting  with separate resolutions for the Management Programme and the All Employee Programme  resolves (iii) on transfers of own common shares free of charge to the participants of the Programmes. As further described in item B.I.iii) and B.II.iii)  respectively  below  the Board of Directors proposes that shares acquired for the purpose of securing Sobi's obligations under previous incentive programmes also may be transferred under the Programmes. The detailed conditions for the Board of Directors' main alternative are set out in item B.I and B.II  respectively  below.Since the Programmes  in principle  are not expected to give rise to any initial social security payments for the Sobi Group  the Board of Directors has decided not to propose to the Annual General Meeting 2023 to resolve on transfers of own common shares on a regulated market in order to cover such payments. However  prior to the transfers of common shares to the participants of the Programmes  the Board of Directors intends to propose to the Annual General Meeting 2025 that transfers be made of own common shares on a regulated market in order to cover such costs.Should the majority required under item B.I or B.II below not be reached  the Board of Directors proposes that Sobi shall be able to enter into an equity swap agreement with a third party  in accordance with item C. below.Preparations of the proposalThe Compensation & Benefits Committee of Sobi has prepared guidelines for the proposed Programmes. These guidelines have been presented for and adopted by the Board of Directors.The Board of Directors has established shareholding guidelines which recommend that the CEO and other members of the Executive Committee (Band B1 participants) accumulate personal holdings in Sobi shares representing a value of an annual gross base salary for the CEO and 50% of an annual gross base salary for other members of the Executive Committee  by maintaining Sobi shares already held as well as Sobi shares allocated under the Programmes and under previous incentive programmes. It is recommended that the personal holding of shares is established within three years from being appointed Executive Committee Member. It is recommended that the CEO and other Executive Committee members maintain shares of such a value for the duration of their appointment as CEO or other Executive Committee member.Hedging arrangements in respect of the ProgrammesB. Directed issue of redeemable and convertible series C shares  authorisation for the Board of Directors to resolve to repurchase all issued redeemable and convertible series C shares and transfers of own common shares to the participants of the ProgrammesI. Management Programmei) Resolution on a directed issue of redeemable and convertible series C sharesIncrease of Sobi's share capital by no more than SEK 840 624.46 through an issue of no more than 1 532 014 series C shares in Sobi.

The reason for the proposed possibility to repurchase own shares is that Sobi shall be able to fulfil its obligations pursuant to the All Employee Programme in a cost-effective manner.iii) Resolution on transfers of own common shares to the participants of the All Employee ProgrammeThe Board of Directors proposes that the shares issued and repurchased in accordance with items B.II.i) and B.II.ii) above  following conversion to common shares  may be transferred under the All Employee Programme.Transfers of Sobi's own common shares to the participants of the All Employee Programme may be made on the following terms:a) Transfers may be made only of common shares in Sobi  whereby a maximum of 143 550 common shares in Sobi (all Employee Matching Shares) may be transferred free of charge to participants of the All Employee Programme.b) Right to purchase common shares in Sobi free of charge shall ‚Äì with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights ‚Äì be granted to such persons within the Sobi Group who are participants in the All Employee Programme.c) Transfers of common shares in Sobi shall be made free of charge at the time and on the other terms that the All Employee Programme's participants are entitled to be allocated shares.d) The number of common shares in Sobi that may be transferred under the All Employee Programme will be subject to recalculation as a result of intervening bonus issues  splits  rights issues and/or other similar corporate events.C.

The number of shares that may be issued  the number of shares that convertible bonds may be converted into and the number of shares that may be subscribed for by the exercise of warrants may not exceed 34 400 000 shares in total.If the authorisation is exercised in full  the dilution would amount to approximately 10% of the number of shares in the company (counted after the authorisation has been fully exercised).The Board of Directors  or any person appointed by it  is authorised to make any minor adjustments to the resolution that may be necessary to enable registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.Majority requirements  etc.The purpose of the authorisation is to enable payment through the issuance of own financial instruments in connection with possible transactions that the company may make as well as to raise capital in order to finance completed or future transactions that the company may make.

General1.1 As per the Swedish Code of Corporate Governance (Code of Governance)  the Company shall each year appoint a Nomination Committee which shall have as its sole task to propose decisions to the Annual General Meeting (AGM) on electoral and remuneration issues  and procedural issue for the appointment of the Nomination Committee for the following year.1.2 The AGM shall either appoint the members of the Nomination Committee or specify how they are to be appointed.

If the Nomination Committee then consists of appointees of less than three of the larger shareholders of the Company  the Chair of the Board shall  with the aim to increase the number of members to three  invite another larger shareholder to join the Nomination Committee.

The Company may however cover reasonable out of pocket expenses that the members may occur in relation to work performed for the Nomination Committee.5.3 The Nomination Committee shall yearly assess this Nomination Committee Process and shall propose changes to it to the AGM  as appropriate.Item 20: Resolution in respect of Employee LTIP 2023The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to establish a long-term share-related incentive plan in the form of a share option plan for members of Group Management and other employees of the Company on the terms and conditions set out below (the ‚ÄúEmployee LTIP 2023‚Äù). Background and purposeThe reason for establishing the Employee LTIP 2023 is to align the interests of the members of Group Management and other employees with the interests of the shareholders as well as to provide market appropriate reward for a new business reflecting continuity  commitment and share price appreciation. The Board of Directors believes that the Employee LTIP 2023 will provide the Company with a crucial component to a competitive total compensation package to attract and retain employees who are critical to the Company‚Äôs future success. The Employee LTIP 2023 follows the same principles as the long term incentive plan resolved upon by the Extraordinary General Meeting 2022. The Employee LTIP 2023 is offered as a complement to base salaries to create an overall remuneration approach that further emphasises the long-term sustainable growth and strategic success of the Company. Terms and conditionsSubject to the terms and conditions of the Employee LTIP 2023  the Company will grant options (‚ÄúEmployee Options‚Äù) free of charge to members of Group Management and other employees as allocated by the Board of Directors  or the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors  pursuant to the following principles. 1. The maximum number of Employee Options that may be granted is 7 000 000. Each Employee Option shall entitle the holder to purchase one share in the Company subject to continued employment within the Group. Accordingly  the maximum number of shares available for the participants under the Employee LTIP 2023 shall be 7 000 000.2. The Board of Directors shall at its discretion be entitled to grant Employee Options to any employees (expected to grant to approximately 30 employees). The Chief Executive Officer may be granted up to 2 290 000 Employee Options and other employees may be granted up to 1 074 000 Employee Options each (subject to the cap of 7 000 000 Employee Options in total).3. The purchase price per share in the Company upon exercise of an Employee Option (the ‚ÄúExercise Price‚Äù) shall correspond to the volume weighted average price for the Company‚Äôs share on Nasdaq Stockholm during 22‚Äì26 May 2023  or a later period of five trading days as determined by the Board of Directors in the event the volume weighted average price during 22‚Äì26 May 2023 is not deemed to be an appropriate Exercise Price due to intervening changes in the Group  the market or otherwise in the industry.4. Instead of participants purchasing shares by paying the Exercise Price at exercise of the Employee Options  the primary settlement method shall be to ‚Äúnet equity settle‚Äù the Employee Options  meaning that the purchase price for each share shall be equal to the quotient value of the share (currently approximately SEK 0.01 per share) and that the number of shares that may be purchased shall be reduced by applying the following formula:Adjusted number of shares = ((A minus B) multiplied by D) divided by (A minus C)  where: A = the volume weighted average price for the Company‚Äôs share on Nasdaq Stockholm during the five trading days immediately preceding the date of exercise of the Employee OptionB = the Exercise PriceC = the quotient value of the Company‚Äôs shareD = the number of Employee Options exercised by the participant Only whole shares (no fractions) may be delivered and the number of shares delivered at net equity settlement shall thus be rounded down to the nearest number of whole shares. 5. In the event a participant cannot exercise its Employee Options to purchase shares in the Company under applicable laws or regulations or at reasonable cost or with reasonable administrative effort by the participant or the Company  the Board of Directors shall have the right to decide to wholly or partly settle the Employee Options in cash. The Board of Directors shall also have the right to in its own discretion decide that shares and/or cash shall be withheld by the Company in order to cover or facilitate the payment of applicable taxes.6. The intention is that the Board of Directors shall grant Employee Options on 1 June 2023  but the Board of Directors shall be authorised to in its own discretion finally determine the date of grant taking into account any potential restrictions under applicable laws or regulations. The Employee Options shall vest on 31 May 2026 (the ‚ÄúVesting Date‚Äù). The three-year period from 1 June 2023 to the Vesting Date is referred to as the ‚ÄúVesting Period‚Äù. After the end of the Vesting Period  participants shall be entitled to exercise all or part of the Employee Options until 31 May 2030.7. In the event of a change of control of the Company or a direct or indirect sale  transfer or other disposal of all or substantially all of the business and assets  the Vesting Period shall be deemed to have completed and the participants shall be entitled to exercise the Employee Options as of the date when the transaction becomes unconditional.8. Continued employment within the group during the entire Vesting Period shall be a condition for the Employee Options to vest. If the participant resigns after the expiry of the Vesting Period  the participant shall only be entitled to exercise Employee Options during a period of three months following the last day of employment  which may be reasonably extended taking into account any potential restrictions under applicable laws or regulations. The Board of Directors shall be authorised to waive and alter these conditions according to circumstances deemed reasonable.9. The Board of Directors shall be entitled to recalculate the maximum number of shares (per Employee Option and in total) and the Exercise Price in the event of intervening rights issues  bonus issues  share splits  reverse share splits  dividends or similar events.10. In order to further align the interests of the members of Group Management with the interests of the shareholders  each member of Group Management shall be required to undertake to retain a minimum of 50 per cent of the shares received when exercising the Employee Options (net after taxes) until the participant has built a personal ownership of shares in the Company equal to 100 per cent of the participant‚Äôs annual gross base salary (200 per cent for the Chief Executive Officer).11. The Board of Directors  or the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors  shall be responsible for the detailed terms and the administration of the Employee LTIP 2023 within the scope and framework of this proposal. In connection therewith  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to adopt different terms and conditions e.g. due to new recruitment  illness  disability  death  redundancy  contractual retirement and other exceptional circumstances determined by the Board of Directors.Delivery of shares and hedging of costsIn order to secure the delivery of shares to the participants and cover potential costs (including taxes and social security charges) at exercise of Employee Options under the Employee LTIP 2023  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to issue up to 7 350 000 warrants of series 2023:1 (see item 21 a) of the proposed agenda). In the event the nine-tenth (9/10) majority requirement applicable to the Board of Directors‚Äô proposal to issue and transfer warrants of series 2023:1 under item 21 a) of the proposed agenda is not satisfied  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to approve that the Company hedges its obligations under the Employee LTIP 2023 by entering into an equity swap arrangement with a third party  whereby the third party in its own name shall be entitled to acquire and transfer shares (including to the participants) in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Employee LTIP 2023 (see item 21 b) of the proposed agenda). Estimated costsThe Employee LTIP 2023 grants participants the right on vesting to purchase shares in the Company for a price equivalent to the Exercise Price. The Employee LTIP 2023 will be accounted for in accordance with the accounting standard IFRS 2 and the costs will be charged to the income statement over the period the Employee Options are earned. The maximum cost for granting Employee Options under the Employee LTIP 2023 (assuming 100 per cent vesting)  excluding costs related to delivery of shares and social security charges  is approximately SEK 28.6 million. Under a scenario where the share price grows by 10 per cent per annum  the maximum cost for social security charges is estimated to be approximately SEK 2.9 million if Employee Options are exercised on the Vesting Date. Effects on key figuresThe effects on key figures depend on the share price development. Assuming a share price and Exercise Price no lower than SEK 10.0; a volatility of 35 per cent; a risk-free rate of 2.28 per cent; a 0 per cent dividend yield; and exercise after 7 years  the number of shares required under the Employee LTIP 2023 amounts to approximately 7 million shares in the Company (subject to final determination of the Exercise Price)  corresponding to approximately 2.4 per cent of the total number of shares and votes in the Company. If the Exercise Price is set above SEK 10.0 the maximum number of shares will decrease with the expected costs constant  and if the Exercise Price is set below SEK 10.0  the maximum number of shares will be constant with a decrease in expected costs. The Employee LTIP 2023 is expected to have only marginal effects on the Company‚Äôs key figures. If the Employee Options are ‚Äúnet equity settled‚Äù  the number of shares used can be significantly reduced. Under a scenario where the share price grows by 10 per cent per annum  the use of shares if all Employee Options were exercised on vesting just after the end of the Vesting Period would decrease from a maximum of 2.4 per cent to approximately 0.6 per cent and if all Employee Options were exercised just before the end of the exercise period on 31 May 2030 to approximately 1.2 per cent. If the warrant settlement method proposed under item 21 a) of the proposed agenda is not approved with the requisite majority and the Company‚Äôs obligations under the Employee LTIP 2023 are settled by way of an equity swap arrangement with a third party  no dilution effect will arise. Other long-term incentive plansFor a description of the Company‚Äôs other outstanding long-term incentive plans (Board LTIP 2022 and Employee LTIP 2022)  please see the Company‚Äôs annual and sustainability report for 2022 (note 22) and the Company‚Äôs website  www.orron.com. Preparation of the proposalThe Employee LTIP 2023 proposal has been prepared by the Compensation Committee and has been approved by the Board of Directors in consultation with external advisers. Majority requirementA resolution in accordance with the Board of Directors‚Äô proposal regarding the establishment of the Employee LTIP 2023 requires support from shareholders representing more than half (1/2) of the votes cast at the Annual General Meeting. A resolution in accordance with the Board of Directors‚Äô proposal regarding the issue and transfer of warrants of series 2023:1 under item 21 a) of the proposed agenda requires support from shareholders representing not less than nine-tenth (9/10) of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the Annual General Meeting. A resolution in accordance with the Board of Directors‚Äô proposal regarding the equity swap arrangement under item 21 b) of the proposed agenda requires support from shareholders representing more than half (1/2) of the votes cast at the Annual General Meeting. Item 21: Resolution in respect of delivery of shares under the Employee LTIP 2023 through (a) an issue and transfer of warrants of series 2023:1 or (b) an equity swap arrangement with a third party BackgroundUnder the Employee LTIP 2023 proposed by the Board of Directors under item 20 of the proposed agenda  the Company has an obligation  subject to certain conditions  to deliver shares in the Company to the participants in the Employee LTIP 2023. In order to secure the Company‚Äôs obligation to deliver shares and to cover a portion of the costs (including taxes and social security charges)  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to issue and transfer up to 7 350 000 warrants of series 2023:1 on the terms and conditions set out in item 21 a) below. In the event the nine-tenth (9/10) majority requirement applicable to the proposed warrant settlement method is not satisfied  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to approve that the Company hedges its obligations under the Employee LTIP 2023 by entering into an equity swap arrangement with a third party  whereby the third party in its own name shall be entitled to acquire and transfer shares (including to the participants) on the terms and conditions set out in item 21 b) below. The Board of Directors considers the warrant settlement method to be the preferred alternative since the costs for an equity swap arrangement are significantly higher than the costs for issuing and transferring warrants. If the Annual General Meeting resolves to approve the proposed warrant settlement method under item 21 a) below with the requisite majority  the Board of Directors‚Äô intends to withdraw its equity swap arrangement proposal under item 21 b) below. Item 21 a): Resolution in respect of delivery of shares under the Employee LTIP 2023 through an issue and transfer of warrants of series 2023:1In order to secure the Company‚Äôs obligation to deliver shares under the Employee LTIP 2023  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meetings resolves to issue and transfer warrants of series 2023:1 in the Company on the following terms and conditions: A maximum of 7 350 000 warrants shall be issued.The right to subscribe for warrants shall  with deviation of the shareholders‚Äô preferential rights  rest with the Company itself.The reason for deviating from the shareholders‚Äô preferential rights is to secure the Company‚Äôs obligations to deliver shares and to cover any costs (including taxes and social security charges) under the Employee LTIP 2023.Subscription for the warrants shall take place on a separate subscription list not later than 1 November 2023.The warrants shall be issued free of charge.Each warrant shall entitle the holder to subscribe for one new share in the Company. The subscription price for each new share shall be equal to the quotient value of the Company‚Äôs share.The warrants may be exercised during the period from and including 1 June 2023 up to and including 1 June 2031.The new shares shall carry rights to dividends for the first time on the record date for dividends that occurs after subscription has been effected.The subscription price and the number of shares for which each warrant entitles subscription may be re-calculated under certain circumstances as set forth in the complete terms and conditions for the warrants.Upon exercise of all 7 350 000 warrants  the Company‚Äôs share capital will increase by SEK 89 424.07 (based on a quotient value of approximately SEK 0.01). If the subscription price exceeds the quotient value of the shares  the excess amount shall be allotted to the non-restricted statutory reserve (Sw. den fria √∂verkursfonden).The Company may transfer up to 7 350 000 warrants (a) free of charge to participants (and/or a designated third party) for the purpose of enabling the delivery of shares in the Company at exercise of Employee Options under the Employee LTIP 2023 and (b) at a price equal to the fair market value of the warrants as determined using a customary valuation method to a designated third party for the purpose of covering any costs (including taxes and social security charges) at exercise of Employee Options under the Employee LTIP 2023.The complete terms and conditions for the warrants of series 2023:1 will be available at the Company and on the Company‚Äô website  www.orron.com  not later than three weeks prior to the Annual General Meeting. The resolution shall be conditional upon that the Annual General Meeting resolves to establish the Employee LTIP 2023 in accordance with the Board of Directors‚Äô proposal under item 20 of the proposed agenda. A resolution in accordance with the Board of Directors‚Äô proposal requires support from shareholders representing not less than nine-tenth (9/10) of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the Annual General Meeting. Item 21 b): Resolution in respect of delivery of shares under the Employee LTIP 2023 through an equity swap arrangement with a third partyThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meetings resolves to approve that the Company hedges its obligations under the Employee LTIP 2023 by entering into an equity swap arrangement with a third party  whereby the third party in its own name shall be entitled to acquire and transfer shares (including to the participants) in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Employee LTIP 2023. The resolution shall be conditional upon that the Annual General Meeting resolves to establish the Employee LTIP 2023 in accordance with the Board of Directors‚Äô proposal under item 20 of the proposed agenda. A resolution in accordance with the Board of Directors‚Äô proposal requires support from shareholders representing more than half (1/2) of the votes cast at the Annual General Meeting. Item 22: Resolution in respect of authorisation for the Board of Directors to resolve on new issue of shares and convertible debenturesThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to authorise the Board of Directors to decide  at one or more occasions until the next Annual General Meeting: (i) to issue no more than 28 500 000 new shares with consideration in cash or in kind or by set-off; and(ii) to issue convertible debentures with consideration in cash or in kind or by set-off  where the number of shares that may be issued after conversion shall not exceed 28 500 000.The Board of Directors may resolve to deviate from the shareholders‚Äô preferential rights. If the Board of Directors resolves to deviate from the shareholders‚Äô preferential rights  the reason shall be to enable or facilitate acquisitions of companies or businesses or other major investments. The total number of shares that can be issued based on the proposed authorisations under (i) and (ii) may not together exceed 28 500 000. If the authorisation is exercised in full for issues with deviation from the shareholders‚Äô preferential rights  the dilution effect is approximately ten per cent. A resolution in accordance with the Board of Directors‚Äô proposal requires the support of shareholders representing at least two thirds (2/3) of the votes cast and of the shares represented at the Annual General Meeting. Item 23: Resolution in respect of authorisation for the Board of Directors to resolve on repurchase and sale of sharesThe Board of Directors proposes that the Board of Directors is authorised  during the period until the next Annual General Meeting  to decide on repurchases and sales of the Company‚Äôs shares on Nasdaq Stockholm. The maximum number of shares repurchased shall be such that shares held in treasury from time to time do not exceed ten percent of all shares of the Company. The maximum number of shares that may be sold is the number of shares that the Company at such time holds in treasury. Repurchase and sale of shares on Nasdaq Stockholm may take place only at a price within the spread between the highest bid price and lowest ask price prevailing and disseminated by Nasdaq Stockholm from time to time. The repurchases and sales shall be made in accordance with the provisions concerning the purchase and sale of a company‚Äôs own shares under applicable stock exchange rules and other applicable rules and regulations. The purpose of the authorisation is to provide the Board of Directors with an instrument to optimise the Company‚Äôs capital structure and to enable the use of own shares as consideration for or as financing of acquisitions of companies or businesses  to secure obligations under incentive plans and to cover costs  including social security charges  that may arise as a result of incentive plans.

The Board of Directors believes that the Employee LTIP 2023 will provide the Company with a crucial component to a competitive total compensation package to attract and retain employees who are critical to the Company‚Äôs future success.The Employee LTIP 2023 follows the same principles as the long term incentive plan resolved upon by the Extraordinary General Meeting 2022. The Employee LTIP 2023 is offered as a complement to base salaries to create an overall remuneration approach that further emphasises the long-term sustainable growth and strategic success of the Company.Terms and conditionsSubject to the terms and conditions of the Employee LTIP 2023  the Company will grant options (‚ÄúEmployee Options‚Äù) free of charge to members of Group Management and other employees as allocated by the Board of Directors  or the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors  pursuant to the following principles.1. The maximum number of Employee Options that may be granted is 7 000 000. Each Employee Option shall entitle the holder to purchase one share in the Company subject to continued employment within the Group. Accordingly  the maximum number of shares available for the participants under the Employee LTIP 2023 shall be 7 000 000.2. The Board of Directors shall at its discretion be entitled to grant Employee Options to any employees (expected to grant to approximately 30 employees). The Chief Executive Officer may be granted up to 2 290 000 Employee Options and other employees may be granted up to 1 074 000 Employee Options each (subject to the cap of 7 000 000 Employee Options in total).3. The purchase price per share in the Company upon exercise of an Employee Option (the ‚ÄúExercise Price‚Äù) shall correspond to the volume weighted average price for the Company‚Äôs share on Nasdaq Stockholm during 22‚Äì26 May 2023  or a later period of five trading days as determined by the Board of Directors in the event the volume weighted average price during 22‚Äì26 May 2023 is not deemed to be an appropriate Exercise Price due to intervening changes in the Group  the market or otherwise in the industry.4. Instead of participants purchasing shares by paying the Exercise Price at exercise of the Employee Options  the primary settlement method shall be to ‚Äúnet equity settle‚Äù the Employee Options  meaning that the purchase price for each share shall be equal to the quotient value of the share (currently approximately SEK 0.01 per share) and that the number of shares that may be purchased shall be reduced by applying the following formula:Adjusted number of shares = ((A minus B) multiplied by D) divided by (A minus C)  where:A = the volume weighted average price for the Company‚Äôs share on Nasdaq Stockholm during the five trading days immediately preceding the date of exercise of the Employee OptionB = the Exercise PriceC = the quotient value of the Company‚Äôs shareD = the number of Employee Options exercised by the participantOnly whole shares (no fractions) may be delivered and the number of shares delivered at net equity settlement shall thus be rounded down to the nearest number of whole shares.5. In the event a participant cannot exercise its Employee Options to purchase shares in the Company under applicable laws or regulations or at reasonable cost or with reasonable administrative effort by the participant or the Company  the Board of Directors shall have the right to decide to wholly or partly settle the Employee Options in cash. The Board of Directors shall also have the right to in its own discretion decide that shares and/or cash shall be withheld by the Company in order to cover or facilitate the payment of applicable taxes.6. The intention is that the Board of Directors shall grant Employee Options on 1 June 2023  but the Board of Directors shall be authorised to in its own discretion finally determine the date of grant taking into account any potential restrictions under applicable laws or regulations. The Employee Options shall vest on 31 May 2026 (the ‚ÄúVesting Date‚Äù). The three-year period from 1 June 2023 to the Vesting Date is referred to as the ‚ÄúVesting Period‚Äù. After the end of the Vesting Period  participants shall be entitled to exercise all or part of the Employee Options until 31 May 2030.7. In the event of a change of control of the Company or a direct or indirect sale  transfer or other disposal of all or substantially all of the business and assets  the Vesting Period shall be deemed to have completed and the participants shall be entitled to exercise the Employee Options as of the date when the transaction becomes unconditional.8. Continued employment within the group during the entire Vesting Period shall be a condition for the Employee Options to vest. If the participant resigns after the expiry of the Vesting Period  the participant shall only be entitled to exercise Employee Options during a period of three months following the last day of employment  which may be reasonably extended taking into account any potential restrictions under applicable laws or regulations. The Board of Directors shall be authorised to waive and alter these conditions according to circumstances deemed reasonable.9. The Board of Directors shall be entitled to recalculate the maximum number of shares (per Employee Option and in total) and the Exercise Price in the event of intervening rights issues  bonus issues  share splits  reverse share splits  dividends or similar events.10. In order to further align the interests of the members of Group Management with the interests of the shareholders  each member of Group Management shall be required to undertake to retain a minimum of 50 per cent of the shares received when exercising the Employee Options (net after taxes) until the participant has built a personal ownership of shares in the Company equal to 100 per cent of the participant‚Äôs annual gross base salary (200 per cent for the Chief Executive Officer).11. The Board of Directors  or the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors  shall be responsible for the detailed terms and the administration of the Employee LTIP 2023 within the scope and framework of this proposal. In connection therewith  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to adopt different terms and conditions e.g. due to new recruitment  illness  disability  death  redundancy  contractual retirement and other exceptional circumstances determined by the Board of Directors.Delivery of shares and hedging of costsIn order to secure the delivery of shares to the participants and cover potential costs (including taxes and social security charges) at exercise of Employee Options under the Employee LTIP 2023  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to issue up to 7 350 000 warrants of series 2023:1 (see item 21 a) of the proposed agenda).In the event the nine-tenth (9/10) majority requirement applicable to the Board of Directors‚Äô proposal to issue and transfer warrants of series 2023:1 under item 21 a) of the proposed agenda is not satisfied  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to approve that the Company hedges its obligations under the Employee LTIP 2023 by entering into an equity swap arrangement with a third party  whereby the third party in its own name shall be entitled to acquire and transfer shares (including to the participants) in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Employee LTIP 2023 (see item 21 b) of the proposed agenda).Estimated costsThe Employee LTIP 2023 grants participants the right on vesting to purchase shares in the Company for a price equivalent to the Exercise Price. The Employee LTIP 2023 will be accounted for in accordance with the accounting standard IFRS 2 and the costs will be charged to the income statement over the period the Employee Options are earned.The maximum cost for granting Employee Options under the Employee LTIP 2023 (assuming 100 per cent vesting)  excluding costs related to delivery of shares and social security charges  is approximately SEK 28.6 million. Under a scenario where the share price grows by 10 per cent per annum  the maximum cost for social security charges is estimated to be approximately SEK 2.9 million if Employee Options are exercised on the Vesting Date.Effects on key figuresThe effects on key figures depend on the share price development. Assuming a share price and Exercise Price no lower than SEK 10.0; a volatility of 35 per cent; a risk-free rate of 2.28 per cent; a 0 per cent dividend yield; and exercise after 7 years  the number of shares required under the Employee LTIP 2023 amounts to approximately 7 million shares in the Company (subject to final determination of the Exercise Price)  corresponding to approximately 2.4 per cent of the total number of shares and votes in the Company. If the Exercise Price is set above SEK 10.0 the maximum number of shares will decrease with the expected costs constant  and if the Exercise Price is set below SEK 10.0  the maximum number of shares will be constant with a decrease in expected costs. The Employee LTIP 2023 is expected to have only marginal effects on the Company‚Äôs key figures.If the Employee Options are ‚Äúnet equity settled‚Äù  the number of shares used can be significantly reduced. Under a scenario where the share price grows by 10 per cent per annum  the use of shares if all Employee Options were exercised on vesting just after the end of the Vesting Period would decrease from a maximum of 2.4 per cent to approximately 0.6 per cent and if all Employee Options were exercised just before the end of the exercise period on 31 May 2030 to approximately 1.2 per cent.If the warrant settlement method proposed under item 21 a) of the proposed agenda is not approved with the requisite majority and the Company‚Äôs obligations under the Employee LTIP 2023 are settled by way of an equity swap arrangement with a third party  no dilution effect will arise.Other long-term incentive plansFor a description of the Company‚Äôs other outstanding long-term incentive plans (Board LTIP 2022 and Employee LTIP 2022)  please see the Company‚Äôs annual and sustainability report for 2022 (note 22) and the Company‚Äôs website  www.orron.com.Preparation of the proposalThe Employee LTIP 2023 proposal has been prepared by the Compensation Committee and has been approved by the Board of Directors in consultation with external advisers.Majority requirementA resolution in accordance with the Board of Directors‚Äô proposal regarding the establishment of the Employee LTIP 2023 requires support from shareholders representing more than half (1/2) of the votes cast at the Annual General Meeting.A resolution in accordance with the Board of Directors‚Äô proposal regarding the issue and transfer of warrants of series 2023:1 under item 21 a) of the proposed agenda requires support from shareholders representing not less than nine-tenth (9/10) of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the Annual General Meeting. A resolution in accordance with the Board of Directors‚Äô proposal regarding the equity swap arrangement under item 21 b) of the proposed agenda requires support from shareholders representing more than half (1/2) of the votes cast at the Annual General Meeting.Item 21: Resolution in respect of delivery of shares under the Employee LTIP 2023 through (a) an issue and transfer of warrants of series 2023:1 or (b) an equity swap arrangement with a third partyBackgroundUnder the Employee LTIP 2023 proposed by the Board of Directors under item 20 of the proposed agenda  the Company has an obligation  subject to certain conditions  to deliver shares in the Company to the participants in the Employee LTIP 2023.In order to secure the Company‚Äôs obligation to deliver shares and to cover a portion of the costs (including taxes and social security charges)  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to issue and transfer up to 7 350 000 warrants of series 2023:1 on the terms and conditions set out in item 21 a) below. In the event the nine-tenth (9/10) majority requirement applicable to the proposed warrant settlement method is not satisfied  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to approve that the Company hedges its obligations under the Employee LTIP 2023 by entering into an equity swap arrangement with a third party  whereby the third party in its own name shall be entitled to acquire and transfer shares (including to the participants) on the terms and conditions set out in item 21 b) below.The Board of Directors considers the warrant settlement method to be the preferred alternative since the costs for an equity swap arrangement are significantly higher than the costs for issuing and transferring warrants. If the Annual General Meeting resolves to approve the proposed warrant settlement method under item 21 a) below with the requisite majority  the Board of Directors‚Äô intends to withdraw its equity swap arrangement proposal under item 21 b) below.Item 21 a): Resolution in respect of delivery of shares under the Employee LTIP 2023 through an issue and transfer of warrants of series 2023:1In order to secure the Company‚Äôs obligation to deliver shares under the Employee LTIP 2023  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meetings resolves to issue and transfer warrants of series 2023:1 in the Company on the following terms and conditions:A maximum of 7 350 000 warrants shall be issued.The right to subscribe for warrants shall  with deviation of the shareholders‚Äô preferential rights  rest with the Company itself.The reason for deviating from the shareholders‚Äô preferential rights is to secure the Company‚Äôs obligations to deliver shares and to cover any costs (including taxes and social security charges) under the Employee LTIP 2023.Subscription for the warrants shall take place on a separate subscription list not later than 1 November 2023.The warrants shall be issued free of charge.Each warrant shall entitle the holder to subscribe for one new share in the Company. The subscription price for each new share shall be equal to the quotient value of the Company‚Äôs share.The warrants may be exercised during the period from and including 1 June 2023 up to and including 1 June 2031.The new shares shall carry rights to dividends for the first time on the record date for dividends that occurs after subscription has been effected.The subscription price and the number of shares for which each warrant entitles subscription may be re-calculated under certain circumstances as set forth in the complete terms and conditions for the warrants.Upon exercise of all 7 350 000 warrants  the Company‚Äôs share capital will increase by SEK 89 424.07 (based on a quotient value of approximately SEK 0.01). If the subscription price exceeds the quotient value of the shares  the excess amount shall be allotted to the non-restricted statutory reserve (Sw. den fria √∂verkursfonden).The Company may transfer up to 7 350 000 warrants (a) free of charge to participants (and/or a designated third party) for the purpose of enabling the delivery of shares in the Company at exercise of Employee Options under the Employee LTIP 2023 and (b) at a price equal to the fair market value of the warrants as determined using a customary valuation method to a designated third party for the purpose of covering any costs (including taxes and social security charges) at exercise of Employee Options under the Employee LTIP 2023.The complete terms and conditions for the warrants of series 2023:1 will be available at the Company and on the Company‚Äô website  www.orron.com  not later than three weeks prior to the Annual General Meeting.The resolution shall be conditional upon that the Annual General Meeting resolves to establish the Employee LTIP 2023 in accordance with the Board of Directors‚Äô proposal under item 20 of the proposed agenda.A resolution in accordance with the Board of Directors‚Äô proposal requires support from shareholders representing not less than nine-tenth (9/10) of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the Annual General Meeting.Item 21 b): Resolution in respect of delivery of shares under the Employee LTIP 2023 through an equity swap arrangement with a third partyThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meetings resolves to approve that the Company hedges its obligations under the Employee LTIP 2023 by entering into an equity swap arrangement with a third party  whereby the third party in its own name shall be entitled to acquire and transfer shares (including to the participants) in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Employee LTIP 2023.The resolution shall be conditional upon that the Annual General Meeting resolves to establish the Employee LTIP 2023 in accordance with the Board of Directors‚Äô proposal under item 20 of the proposed agenda.A resolution in accordance with the Board of Directors‚Äô proposal requires support from shareholders representing more than half (1/2) of the votes cast at the Annual General Meeting.Item 22: Resolution in respect of authorisation for the Board of Directors to resolve on new issue of shares and convertible debenturesThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to authorise the Board of Directors to decide  at one or more occasions until the next Annual General Meeting:(i) to issue no more than 28 500 000 new shares with consideration in cash or in kind or by set-off; and(ii) to issue convertible debentures with consideration in cash or in kind or by set-off  where the number of shares that may be issued after conversion shall not exceed 28 500 000.The Board of Directors may resolve to deviate from the shareholders‚Äô preferential rights. If the Board of Directors resolves to deviate from the shareholders‚Äô preferential rights  the reason shall be to enable or facilitate acquisitions of companies or businesses or other major investments.The total number of shares that can be issued based on the proposed authorisations under (i) and (ii) may not together exceed 28 500 000. If the authorisation is exercised in full for issues with deviation from the shareholders‚Äô preferential rights  the dilution effect is approximately ten per cent.A resolution in accordance with the Board of Directors‚Äô proposal requires the support of shareholders representing at least two thirds (2/3) of the votes cast and of the shares represented at the Annual General Meeting.Item 23: Resolution in respect of authorisation for the Board of Directors to resolve on repurchase and sale of sharesThe Board of Directors proposes that the Board of Directors is authorised  during the period until the next Annual General Meeting  to decide on repurchases and sales of the Company‚Äôs shares on Nasdaq Stockholm. The maximum number of shares repurchased shall be such that shares held in treasury from time to time do not exceed ten percent of all shares of the Company. The maximum number of shares that may be sold is the number of shares that the Company at such time holds in treasury. Repurchase and sale of shares on Nasdaq Stockholm may take place only at a price within the spread between the highest bid price and lowest ask price prevailing and disseminated by Nasdaq Stockholm from time to time. The repurchases and sales shall be made in accordance with the provisions concerning the purchase and sale of a company‚Äôs own shares under applicable stock exchange rules and other applicable rules and regulations.The purpose of the authorisation is to provide the Board of Directors with an instrument to optimise the Company‚Äôs capital structure and to enable the use of own shares as consideration for or as financing of acquisitions of companies or businesses  to secure obligations under incentive plans and to cover costs  including social security charges  that may arise as a result of incentive plans.The Board of Directors‚Äô reasoned statement pursuant to pursuant to Chapter 19  Section 22 of the Swedish Companies Act will be available at the Company and on the Company‚Äô website  www.orron.com  not later than three weeks prior to the Annual General Meeting.A resolution in accordance with the Board of Directors‚Äô proposal requires the support of shareholders representing at least two thirds (2/3) of the votes cast and of the shares represented at the Annual General Meeting.Item 24 a)‚Äìb): Resolutions in respect of proposals from a shareholderA shareholder proposes (a) to make a provision of MSEK 1 394.8 for the Swedish Prosecution Authority‚Äôs claim against the Company  and (b) that the Company discloses in detail all current and projected direct and indirect costs and material risks connected with the legal defence of its former Chairman Ian Lundin and its former CEO and Director Alex Schneiter  and the Company itself.Shareholder proposals in relation to the Company‚Äôs past activities in Sudan were brought by the same shareholder to the 2012  2013  2017  2019  2020  2021 and 2022 Annual General Meetings  where they were rejected by the shareholders.

A division into two parts is proposed: (I) one part directed to managers and executives (the ""Management Programme"") and (II) one part directed to all other employees (the ""All Employee Programme""  jointly with the Management Programme  the ""Programmes"")  with separate resolutions on each part.The overall purpose of the Programmes is to closely align the employees' interests with those of the shareholders and to create a long-term commitment to Sobi. The Management Programme provides Sobi with a crucial component of a competitive total remuneration package with which to attract and retain executives who are critical to Sobi's long-term success. The purpose of the All Employee Programme is to create commitment and motivation for the entire permanent workforce of the Sobi Group. For these reasons the Board of Directors considers that having recurring long-term incentive programmes is a vital and important part of Sobi's total remuneration package.The Board of Directors of Sobi has evaluated the long-term incentive programmes approved by the Annual General Meeting 2022 and has concluded that the All Employee Programme as well as the Management Programme work well and satisfy the intended purposes.Similar to the incentive programmes approved by the Annual General Meeting 2022  the Programmes shall be inspiring  achievable  easy to understand  cost effective to administer  easy to communicate and in line with market practice. Following implementation of the Programmes  the Board of Directors intends to carry out an evaluation thereof in order to systematically analyse the achieved results in relation to the aims outlined above. The aim of the evaluation will be to determine whether the Programmes satisfies their purposes  and this will also include a review of the outcome and the costs for the Programmes.A. Implementation of the ProgrammesThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting 2023 resolves on implementation of the Programmes in accordance with the principal terms and conditions set out below:I. The Management ProgrammeIt is proposed that the Management Programme be open to no more than 341 permanent employees of the Sobi Group  whereof no more than 270 employees on director level of the Sobi Group (""Band D"")  no more than 40 employees on vice president level of the Sobi Group (""Band C"")  no more than 15 pre-selected key employees of the Sobi Group (""Band B2"")  no more than 15 employees who are members of the Executive Committee of the Sobi Group (""Band B1"") and the CEO of Sobi (""CEO"")  on the following terms and conditions and the terms and conditions set out in item A.III below.Performance sharesa) Each participant in Band D  Band C  Band B2  Band B1 and the CEO will free of charge receive a performance share award under the Management Programme (""LTIP Award"") entitling the participant to receive an allocation of a number of Sobi common shares free of charge from Sobi or from a designated third party  subject to the satisfaction of the condition in section e) below as well as the satisfaction of the performance conditions set out in section c) below (""Management Performance Shares""). Any Management Performance Shares will be allocated after the expiration of the three-year vesting period beginning on the date that Sobi starts inviting the employees in Band D  Band C  Band B2  Band B1 and the CEO to participate in the Management Programme (the ""Vesting Period""). Sobi must invite the employees in Band D  Band C  Band B2  Band B1 and the CEO to participate in the Management Programme no later than on 31 December 2023.b) The value of the underlying shares at the time of grant in respect of each LTIP Award will amount to (i) 150% of the gross annual fixed salary in 2023 for the CEO  (ii) 75% of the gross annual fixed salary in 2023 for each Band B1 participant  on an individual basis  (iii) 75% of the gross annual fixed salary in 2023 for each Band B2 participant  on an individual basis  (iv) the sum of 37.5% of the average gross annual fixed salary in 2023 for Band C participants and 37.5% of the gross annual fixed salary in 2023 for each Band C participant  on an individual basis  and (v) 35% of the average gross annual fixed salary in 2023 for Band D participants. The share price used to calculate the value of the underlying shares in respect of each LTIP Award  and hence the number of shares to which each LTIP Award entitles  shall be the volume-weighted average price paid for the Sobi common share on Nasdaq Stockholm  adjusted for any dividend payments  during a period of ten trading days in connection with the commencement of the Vesting Period.c) The portion (if any) of an LTIP Award that will vest at the end of the Vesting Period is based on and subject to the satisfaction of the following performance conditions:Absolute TSR[1] increase60% of an LTIP Award granted to a participant will be subject to satisfaction of certain levels of absolute TSR increase over the Vesting Period. In order for any vesting related to absolute TSR increase to occur  the TSR must increase by more than 10% over the Vesting Period. In order for full vesting related to absolute TSR increase to occur  the TSR must increase by at least 40% over the Vesting Period. If the TSR increase is between 10% and 40% over the Vesting Period  a linear vesting related to absolute TSR increase will occur. The calculation of the TSR shall for the purpose of the TSR performance condition be based on a comparison of the volume-weighted average price paid for the Sobi common share on Nasdaq Stockholm  adjusted for any dividend payments  during a period of ten trading days in connection with the start of the Vesting Period and the volume-weighted average price paid for the Sobi common share on Nasdaq Stockholm  adjusted for any dividend payments  during the last ten trading days of the Vesting Period.Annual revenues40% of an LTIP Award granted to a participant will be subject to the Sobi Group's actual annual revenues reaching or exceeding the Sobi Group's target annual revenues for the Management Programme as set by the Board of Directors each year. A comparison shall be made for each of the financial years 2023  2024 and 2025. If the threshold is reached or exceeded for a financial year  full vesting related to annual revenues in respect of that financial year will occur (i.e. 1/3 of 40%). If the threshold is not reached for a financial year  no vesting related to annual revenues in respect of that financial year will occur.d) Management Performance Shares may be allocated only after the expiration of the Vesting Period  unless the Board of Directors of Sobi in an individual case resolves otherwise.e) In order for a Management Programme participant to be allocated Management Performance Shares it is a condition that  with certain specific exemptions  he/she has been permanently employed within the Sobi Group for the duration of the whole Vesting Period.f) If significant changes in the Sobi Group or in the market occur which  in the opinion of the Board of Directors  would result in a situation where the conditions for allocation of Management Performance Shares become unreasonable  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to make adjustments to the Management Programme  including  among other things  be entitled to resolve on a reduced allocation of Management Performance Shares  or that no Management Performance Shares shall be allocated at all.Employee stock optionsa) In addition to the LTIP Award  the CEO as well as Band B1 and Band B2 participants (approximately 31 employees in total) shall free of charge be awarded employee stock options (""Options"").b) The Options shall not be deemed securities and shall be non-transferable.c) The Options shall be awarded as soon as possible after the Annual General Meeting 2023. For new employees awards may take place at a later point in time but no later than on 31 December 2023.d) Each Option shall entitle the holder to acquire one Sobi common share (""Option Share"") at a strike price equivalent to 105% of the volume-weighted average price paid for the Sobi common share at Nasdaq Stockholm  adjusted for any dividend payments  during a period of ten trading days in connection with the commencement of the Vesting Period (the ""Strike price""). The Strike Price shall be rounded to the nearest SEK 0.01  whereby SEK 0.005 shall be rounded upwards. The Strike price and the number of Option Shares that may be acquired for each Option will be subject to recalculation as a result of intervening bonus issues  splits  rights issues and/or other similar corporate events.e) The value of each award of Options will amount to (i) 150% of the gross annual fixed salary in 2023 for the CEO  (ii) 75% of the gross annual fixed salary in 2023 for each Band B1 participant  on an individual basis and (iii) 75% of the gross annual fixed salary in 2023 for for each Band B2 participant  on an individual basis. The valuation of the Options will be carried out pursuant to Black & Scholes. The aggregate number of Options awarded will not exceed 1 647 605 and amount to:CEO: no more than 266 648 Options.Band B1: no more than between 28 491 and 93 128 Options per person  depending on the size of the gross annual fixed salary in 2023.Band B2: no more than between 15 669 and 59 501 Options per person  depending on the size of the gross annual fixed salary in 2023.f) Each holder of Options shall be entitled to exercise the Options as from the third anniversary of the award date  up to and including the fifth anniversary of the award date (""Exercise Period"")  subject to satisfaction of the condition in section h) below as well as the satisfaction of the performance condition set out in section g) below. In accordance with customary terms and conditions  it shall be possible to exercise the Options prematurely in the event of  inter alia  compulsory redemption of shares  liquidation or merger.g) The vesting of Options will be subject to the Sobi Group's actual average revenues reaching or exceeding the Sobi Group's average target revenues for the Management Programme as set by the Board of Directors each year over the financial years 2023-2025. If the threshold is reached or exceeded  full vesting of Options will occur. If the threshold is not reached  no vesting of Options will occur.h) In order for a Management Programme participant to be eligible to exercise Options it is a condition that  with certain specific exemptions  he/she has been permanently employed within the Sobi Group from the start of the Vesting Period up until the time of exercise of Options.i) If significant changes in the Sobi Group or in the market occur which would result in a situation where the Board of Directors considers the number of Options subject to exercise to be unreasonable  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to reduce the number of Options subject to exercise. Such reduction may result in the number of Options subject to exercise being reduced to zero. Further  the value of each Sobi common share received upon exercise of Options shall be capped to three times the Strike price  meaning that the number of Sobi common shares delivered to Management Program participants upon exercise of Options may be reduced.II. The All Employee ProgrammeIt is proposed that the All Employee Programme be open to approximately 825 permanent employees of the Sobi Group (""Employees"")  on the following terms and conditions and the terms and conditions set out in item A.III below.a) The All Employee Programme will require Employees to make investments of their own in common shares in Sobi on Nasdaq Stockholm (""Employee Investment Shares""). For each Employee Investment Share  the Employees will have the possibility to be allocated two common shares in Sobi free of charge (""Employee Matching Shares"")  from Sobi or from a designated third party. The Employee Matching Shares will be allocated following expiration of the three-year vesting period beginning on the date that Sobi starts inviting the Employees to participate in the All Employee Programme (the ""Vesting Period""). Sobi must invite the Employees to participate in the All Employee Programme no later than on 31 December 2023.b) The maximum number of Employee Investment Shares each Employee may invest in depends on the gross annual average fixed salary for Employees in 2023. Employee Investment Shares may be acquired for an amount corresponding to no more than 2.5% of the gross annual average fixed salary for Employees in 2023.c) All Employee Programme participants must purchase Employee Investment Shares in connection with the start of the Vesting Period.d) Employee Matching Shares may be allocated only after the expiration of the Vesting Period  unless the Board of Directors of Sobi in an individual case resolves otherwise.e) In order for an All Employee Programme participant to be allocated Employee Matching Shares it is a condition that  with certain specific exemptions  he/she has been permanently employed within the Sobi Group for the duration of the whole Vesting Period and that the participant  until the expiration of this Vesting Period  has retained the Employee Investment Shares purchased. Any disposal of Employee Investment Shares prior to the expiration of the Vesting Period will generally result in no Employee Matching Shares being allocated.III. Terms and conditions applying to the Management Programme and the All Employee Programmea) The Board of Directors shall be authorised to establish the detailed terms and conditions for the Programmes. The Board of Directors may  in that regard  make necessary or appropriate adjustments to satisfy certain regulations or market conditions outside Sweden  including  among other things  to offer cash settlement.b) Participation in the Programmes presupposes that such participation is legally possible in the various jurisdictions concerned and that the administrative costs and financial efforts are reasonable in the opinion of the Board of Directors.c) The Programmes shall jointly comprise no more than 4 038 431 common shares in Sobi  of which 1 413 067 constitute Management Performance Shares  1 647 605 constitute Option Shares and 143 550 constitute Employee Matching Shares. The remaining 834 209 common shares in Sobi are such shares that may be transferred by Sobi in order to cover the cash flow effects associated with the Programmes  primarily social security charges.d) The number of Employee Matching Shares  Option Shares and Management Performance Shares  will be subject to recalculation as a result of intervening bonus issues  splits  rights issues and/or other similar corporate events.Costs for the Programmes etc.The costs for the Programmes  which are charged in the profit and loss account  are calculated according to the accounting standard IFRS 2 and distributed on a linear basis over the Vesting Period. The calculation has been made based on the following assumptions: (i) a market price of the Sobi common share of SEK 234  (ii) no dividend is paid by Sobi during the Programmes  (iii) an assessment of future volatility in respect of the Sobi common share  (iv) full vesting of Management Performance Shares related to annual revenues will occur  and (v) full vesting of Options. In total  this can lead to maximum costs for the Programmes of approximately SEK 273.9 million  excluding social security costs. The costs for social security charges are calculated to approximately SEK 117.7 million assuming an annual share price increase of 10% during the Vesting Period. In addition to what is set forth above  the maximum costs for the Programmes have been based on a share price of SEK 234 at the time of the commencement of the Vesting Period  that the Programmes comprise 1 166 participants in total  that each All Employee Programme participant makes a maximum investment and based on historical employee turnover for the Sobi Group of 12%. If the share price increases from SEK 234 with 10% until the implementation of the Programmes the effect on costs would only be marginal as the number of Employee Matching Shares  Management Performance Shares and Option Shares would be reduced correspondingly. Also in case of a decrease in the share price the effect on costs would be marginal. Based on the assumptions above the annual costs for the Programmes  including social security charges  corresponds to approximately 3.6% of Sobi's total annual employee costs.If the Programmes had been implemented in 2022  if the company had had costs in accordance with the example in the preceding paragraph  and Employee Matching Shares  Management Performance Shares and Option Shares had been allocated in 2022 in accordance with the assumptions in the sample calculation  which among other things assumes an annual share price increase of 10% during the Vesting Period  the earnings per share for the financial year 2022 had decreased by SEK 0.47 to SEK 8.45 and the shareholders' equity per share for the financial year 2022 had decreased by SEK 1.18 to SEK 84.42.DilutionUpon full allocation of Employee Matching Shares  Management Performance Shares and Option Shares  the number of shares under the Programmes amounts to 3 204 222 common shares in Sobi  corresponding to a dilution effect of approximately 1.07% of the share capital and the votes. Aggregated with the 834 209 shares that may be transferred in order to cover the cash flow effects associated with the Programmes  primarily social security charges  the maximum dilution effect of the Programmes amounts to approximately 1.34% of the share capital and the votes. If all outstanding long-term incentive programmes are included in the calculation  then the corresponding maximum level of dilution amounts to 4.57%.Hedging arrangementsThe Board of Directors has considered different methods for transfer of shares under the Programmes  in order to implement the Programmes in a cost-effective and flexible manner. The Board of Directors has found the most cost-effective alternative to be  and thus proposes that the Annual General Meeting as a main alternative  with separate resolutions for the Management Programme and the All Employee Programme  resolves on (i) a directed issue of redeemable and convertible series C shares and (ii) an authorisation for the Board of Directors to resolve on the repurchase of all issued redeemable and convertible series C shares. Following conversion to common shares in Sobi  the shares are intended to be transferred to the participants of the Programmes as well as transferred on a regulated market in order to cover the cash flow effects associated with the Programmes  primarily social security charges. For this purpose  the Board of Directors further proposes that the Annual General Meeting  with separate resolutions for the Management Programme and the All Employee Programme  resolves (iii) on transfers of own common shares free of charge to the participants of the Programmes. As further described in item B.I.iii) and B.II.iii)  respectively  below  the Board of Directors proposes that shares acquired for the purpose of securing Sobi's obligations under previous incentive programmes also may be transferred under the Programmes. The detailed conditions for the Board of Directors' main alternative are set out in item B.I and B.II  respectively  below.Since the Programmes  in principle  are not expected to give rise to any initial social security payments for the Sobi Group  the Board of Directors has decided not to propose to the Annual General Meeting 2023 to resolve on transfers of own common shares on a regulated market in order to cover such payments. However  prior to the transfers of common shares to the participants of the Programmes  the Board of Directors intends to propose to the Annual General Meeting 2025 that transfers be made of own common shares on a regulated market in order to cover such costs.Should the majority required under item B.I or B.II below not be reached  the Board of Directors proposes that Sobi shall be able to enter into an equity swap agreement with a third party  in accordance with item C. below.Preparations of the proposalThe Compensation & Benefits Committee of Sobi has prepared guidelines for the proposed Programmes. These guidelines have been presented for and adopted by the Board of Directors.The Board of Directors has established shareholding guidelines which recommend that the CEO and other members of the Executive Committee (Band B1 participants) accumulate personal holdings in Sobi shares representing a value of an annual gross base salary for the CEO and 50% of an annual gross base salary for other members of the Executive Committee  by maintaining Sobi shares already held as well as Sobi shares allocated under the Programmes and under previous incentive programmes. It is recommended that the personal holding of shares is established within three years from being appointed Executive Committee Member. It is recommended that the CEO and other Executive Committee members maintain shares of such a value for the duration of their appointment as CEO or other Executive Committee member.Hedging arrangements in respect of the ProgrammesB. Directed issue of redeemable and convertible series C shares  authorisation for the Board of Directors to resolve to repurchase all issued redeemable and convertible series C shares and transfers of own common shares to the participants of the ProgrammesI. Management Programmei) Resolution on a directed issue of redeemable and convertible series C sharesIncrease of Sobi's share capital by no more than SEK 840 624.46 through an issue of no more than 1 532 014 series C shares in Sobi. The issue shall be effected on the following terms:a) The new shares shall ‚Äì with deviation from the shareholders' preferential right to subscribe for shares ‚Äì be subscribed for only by an external party who has been informed in advance.b) The price to be paid for each new share shall correspond to the quotient value of the share at the time of the subscription of the shares.[2]c) The new shares shall be subscribed for during the period 10 May ‚Äì 9 November 2023. Oversubscription is not permitted.d) Payment for shares subscribed for shall be effected at subscription of the shares.e) The new shares shall be entitled to dividends from and including the financial year 2023.f) The new shares will be subject to restrictions as set forth in Chapter 4  Section 6 (conversion provision) and Chapter 20  Section 31 (redemption provision) in the Swedish Companies Act (SFS 2005:551).ii) Authorisation for the Board of Directors to decide on a repurchase of all issued redeemable and convertible series C sharesAuthorisation for the Board of Directors to decide on a repurchase of all issued redeemable and convertible series C shares in Sobi on the following terms:a) Repurchase may be made through a public offer directed to all owners of series C shares in Sobi.b) The authorisation is valid and may be exercised on one or several occasions until the Annual General Meeting 2024.c) The number of series C shares permitted to be repurchased shall amount to no more than 1 532 014.d) Repurchase of shares shall be made at a lowest price per share of 100% and a highest price of 105% of the quotient value  applicable at the time of the subscription of shares according to section B.I.i) above.e) Payment for shares repurchased shall be made in cash.f) The Board of Directors shall be authorised to establish additional terms for the repurchase.g) Repurchase shall also include a so-called interim share  designated by Euroclear Sweden AB as a ""paid subscription share"" (Sw. BTA) relating to a series C share.The repurchase of own shares is an integrated part of the hedging arrangements for the Management Programme. The reason for the proposed possibility to repurchase own shares is that Sobi shall be able to fulfil its obligations pursuant to the Management Programme in a cost-effective manner.iii) Resolution on transfers of own common shares to the participants of the Management ProgrammeSeries C shares have been issued and repurchased by Sobi under previous incentive programmes for the purpose of securing Sobi's obligations under such programmes. Those shares have been converted to common shares. Full allocation of shares will not take place under these programmes and  accordingly  all shares will not be required to secure the obligations under such programmes.

Closing of the meetingThe Nomination Committee's proposalsItems 2  11-14 ‚Äì Proposals for election of Chair of the meeting  determination of the number of Board members and fees to the Board members and the Auditors  and election of Board members and AuditorsThe Nomination Committee ahead of the AGM 2023 has consisted of Johan Hjertonsson (Investment AB Latour  Chair of the Nomination Committee)  Mikael Ekdahl (Melker Sch√∂rling AB)  Fredrik √Ötting (EQT AB) and Henrik Didner (Didner & Gerge Fonder).The reasoned statement of the Nomination Committee  which presents and motivates the below proposals and also reports on the committee's activities  will be held available at the company website  www.securitas.com/agm2023.The Nomination Committee has proposed the following:Jan Svensson  Chair of the Board  shall be elected Chair of the AGM (item 2).The number of Board members shall be nine  with no deputy members (item 11).Fees to the Board members for the period up to and including the AGM 2024 shall amount to SEK 10 689 000 in total (including fees for committee work). The proposed total fees are an increase of approximately 3.6 percent compared with the total fees for the previous year  adjusted for the increased number of Board members that is proposed. It is the Nomination Committee's expectation that part of the fee should be used to increase holdings of Securitas' shares among the Board members. The fees shall be distributed between the Board members as follows: the Chair of the Board shall receive SEK 2 640 000 and each of the other Board members shall receive SEK 870 000 (item 12).As consideration for the committee work  the Chair of the Audit Committee shall receive SEK 405 000  the Chair of the Remuneration Committee shall receive SEK 109 000  the members of the Audit Committee each SEK 260 000 and the members of the Remuneration Committee each SEK 55 000 (item 12).The Auditor's fees are proposed to be paid as per agreement (item 12).Re-election of the Board members Jan Svensson  Ingrid Bonde  John Brandon  Fredrik Cappelen  Gunilla Fransson  Sofia Sch√∂rling H√∂gberg  Harry Klagsbrun and Johan Menckel (item 13).New election of √Ösa Bergman as Board member. √Ösa Bergman is President and CEO of Sweco AB and Board member of Svenska Cellulosa AB SCA and Swegon Group AB. She previously held various senior positions within the Sweco group (item 13).Jan Svensson shall be re-elected as Chair of the Board (item 13).In accordance with the Audit Committee's recommendation  re-election of the auditing firm Ernst & Young AB  for a period up to and including the AGM 2024. Ernst & Young AB has informed that Rickard Andersson will be auditor in charge (item 14).Information about the proposed Board members is available on the company website  www.securitas.com.The Board's proposalsItem 9 (b) and (c) ‚Äì Proposal for dividend and record dateThe Board proposes that a dividend of SEK 3.45 per share is distributed to the shareholders in two payments of SEK 1.75 per share and SEK 1.70 per share  respectively. The record date for the first payment is proposed to be May 8  2023  and for the second payment November 20  2023. If the AGM so resolves  the first payment is expected to be distributed by Euroclear Sweden AB starting May 11  2023  and the second payment starting November 23  2023. The Board has presented a motivated statement pursuant to Chapter 18  Section 4 of the Swedish Companies Act.Item 16 ‚Äì Proposal for resolution on authorization of the Board to resolve on acquisition and transfer of the company's own sharesThe Board proposes that the AGM authorizes the Board to resolve upon acquisition of the company's own shares of Series B according to the following terms: (i) acquisition of shares may take place on Nasdaq Stockholm  (ii) acquisition of shares may take place on one or several occasions during the time up to the AGM 2024  (iii) acquisition of shares may only be made so that the shares held by the company at any point in time does not exceed ten (10) percent of all shares in the company  (iv) acquisition of shares shall be made at a price which falls within the prevailing price interval registered at each point in time  meaning the interval between the highest purchase price and the lowest selling price  (v) payment for acquired shares shall be made in cash  and (vi) the Board should be authorized to decide upon any additional terms for the acquisition.Furthermore  the Board proposes that the AGM authorizes the Board to resolve upon transfer of the company's own shares of Series B according to the following terms: (i) transfer of shares may take place on Nasdaq Stockholm or in connection with acquisition of companies or businesses  on market terms  (ii) transfer of shares may take place on one or several occasions during the time up to the AGM 2024  (iii) the maximum number of shares to be transferred may not exceed the number of shares held by the company at the time of the Board's resolution  (iv) transfer of shares shall be made at a price which falls within the prevailing price interval registered at each point in time  meaning the interval between the highest purchase price and the lowest selling price  (v) payment for transferred shares may be made in other forms than cash  and (vi) the Board should be authorized to decide upon any additional terms for the transfer. The authorization includes the right to resolve on deviation of the preferential rights of shareholders.The purpose of the proposed authorizations is to (a) allow the Board to adjust the company's capital structure  to contribute to shareholder value  (b) be able to exploit attractive acquisition opportunities by fully or partly financing future acquisitions with the company's own shares  and (c) ensure the company's undertakings in respect of share-related or share-based incentive programs (other than delivery of shares to participants of incentive programs)  including covering social security costs. If the Board decides to adjust the company's capital structure in accordance with (a) above  the Board intends to propose that the company's share capital shall be decreased through share reduction of the repurchased shares.The Board has presented a motivated statement pursuant to Chapter 19  Section 22 of the Swedish Companies Act.A decision by the AGM on the proposal according to this item must be supported by shareholders representing at least two thirds of the votes cast as well as the shares present at the AGM in order for the proposal to be adopted.Item 17 ‚Äì Proposal for a long-term incentive program  including hedging measures by way of a share swap agreement (LTI 2023/2025)Summary of the programThe Annual General Meetings 2019  2020  2021 and 2022 resolved on long-term incentive programs for the CEO  other members of Group management and certain other key employees within the Securitas Group (together the ""LTI Programs""). The Board proposes that the AGM resolves to implement a long-term incentive program (""LTI 2023/2025"")  with the main principles below.LTI 2023/2025 is proposed to include approximately 90 employees including the CEO  other members of Group management and certain other key employees within the Securitas Group. In order to participate in the LTI 2023/2025  the participants will have to invest in Series B shares in Securitas at market price or nominate Series B shares already held  as further set out below. For every Series B share purchased or nominated within the scope of LTI 2023/2025  the company will award so called performance awards free of charge in accordance with the terms stipulated below.A change compared to previous LTI Programs is that the performance condition for LTI 2023/2025 is based on Securitas' operating margin  instead of the parameter earnings per share. This is in line with the new financial targets presented by Securitas in 2022  where a new operating margin target replaced the previous target of an increase in earnings per share.The rationale for the proposalThe purpose of LTI 2023/2025 is to create a strong long-term incentive for top executives of the Group  strengthen the Group's ability to retain and recruit top executives  provide competitive remuneration  and to align the interests of the shareholders with the interests of the executives concerned by enabling the participants to become substantial shareholders in the company. Through a share-based incentive program  the employees' remuneration is tied to the company's future earnings and value growth. In light of the above  the Board believes that the implementation of LTI 2023/2025 will have a positive effect on the long-term value growth of the Group and consequently that LTI 2023/2025 is beneficial to both the shareholders and the company.Personally invested sharesIn order to participate in LTI 2023/2025  the participants will  with the exceptions stated below  during the period May 8  2023 ‚Äì June 8  2023 (the ""Investment Period"") have to either (i) purchase Series B shares in Securitas in the market and nominate such shares to LTI 2023/2025  (ii) nominate Series B shares currently vesting in LTI 2020/2022  or (iii) nominate shares nominated in LTI 2020/2022[1] (""Personally Invested Shares"").The value of a participant's Personally Invested Shares shall be based on the market price for the company's Series B share and shall correspond to minimum 5 percent (all participants) and maximum 15 percent (the CEO)  12.5 percent (other members of Group management) or 10 percent (other participants)  respectively  of the participant's base salary.If the participant has access to inside information and therefore is prevented from purchasing or nominating Personally Invested Shares during the Investment Period  the Board shall be entitled to extend or postpone the Investment Period in individual cases  but no later than to the next AGM. The Board shall further  in individual cases  be entitled to accept nomination of shares acquired prior to the Investment Period  but not earlier than January 1  2023  and/or acquired through e.g. a pension insurance as Personally Invested Shares  where the participant  in the Board's opinion  has valid reasons for nominating such shares to LTI 2023/2025.Participants in LTI 2023/2025 and allocationLTI 2023/2025 is proposed to include approximately 90 senior executives and key employees within the Securitas Group  divided in three categories.Category 1For each Personally Invested Share by the CEO of the Group under LTI 2023/2025  the company will award five performance awards to the CEO.Category 2For each Personally Invested Share by another member of Group management (currently thirteen individuals) under LTI 2023/2025  the relevant individual will be awarded four performance awards.Category 3For each Personally Invested Share by another participant under LTI 2023/2025  the relevant individual will be awarded three performance awards.Performance conditionThe number of Series B shares that the performance awards will entitle the participant to receive depends on the development of Securitas' operating margin[2]  compared to minimum and maximum target levels as defined by the Board  during the measurement period January 1  2023 ‚Äì December 31  2025.If the minimum level is not reached  the performance awards will entitle participants to receive zero Series B shares  whereas if the maximum level is reached  each performance award will entitle participants to receive one Series B share. If the outcome falls between the minimum level and the maximum level  participants' entitlement to Series B shares will be calculated linearly between zero and one Series B share per performance award. The Board intends to present the fulfilment of the performance-based condition in the Annual Report for the financial year 2025.Other conditionsIn addition to the above conditions  the following shall apply for the performance awards.The performance awards shall be awarded free of charge at the end of the Investment Period  subject to vesting.Each performance award entitles the holder to receive one Series B share free of charge (subject to the performance condition set out above) three years after allotment of the award (the ""Vesting Period"")  provided that the holder  with some exceptions  is still employed by the Securitas Group as per December 31  2025  and has maintained the full amount of Personally Invested Shares purchased or nominated under LTI 2023/2025 during the entire Vesting Period.To make the participants' interest equal with the shareholders'  the company will compensate the participants for distributed dividend during the Vesting Period by increasing the number of Series B shares that each performance award may entitle the participant to receive after the Vesting Period.The number of Series B shares that each performance award may entitle the participant to receive may be subject to recalculation due to share issues  splits  reverse splits and similar dispositions.The performance awards are non-transferable and may not be pledged.The performance awards can be awarded by the company or any other company within the Group.Preparation and administrationThe Board shall be responsible for preparing the detailed terms and conditions of LTI 2023/2025 in accordance with the mentioned terms and guidelines. To this end  the Board shall be entitled to make adjustments to meet foreign regulations or market conditions. The Board may also make other adjustments if significant changes in the Securitas Group  or its operating environment  would result in a situation where the decided terms and conditions for LTI 2023/2025 no longer are appropriate. Such adjustments include a right for the Board to resolve on a reduction of the number of Series B shares that the performance awards would entitle a participant to receive  if the number of Series B shares that a participant would be entitled to ‚Äì considering Securitas' result and financial position  other circumstances regarding the Group's development and the conditions on the stock market ‚Äì would be clearly unreasonable.Furthermore  in the event that the Board considers that the delivery of shares under LTI 2023/2025 cannot be achieved at reasonable cost  with reasonable administrative efforts or due to specific market conditions  participants may instead be offered a cash settlement.Participation in LTI 2023/2025 also presumes that such participation is lawful and that such participation in Securitas' opinion can take place with reasonable administrative costs and economic efforts. The Board shall be entitled to implement an alternative incentive solution for employees in such countries where participation in LTI 2023/2025 is not advisable  which alternative solution shall  as far as practically possible  correspond to the terms of the LTI 2023/2025.Scope and cost of the programLTI 2023/2025 may  if the share price for the company's Series B share remains the same during the program's term  result in a maximum amount corresponding to 75 percent (CEO)  50 percent (other members of Group management) or 30 percent (other participants)  respectively  of the participants annual base salary (excluding social security costs). Such outcome is subject to the number of Personally Invested Shares being maximized  meaning that the value of the participant's Personally Invested Shares corresponds to 15 percent (the CEO)  12.5 percent (other members of Group management) or 10 percent (other participants)  respectively  of the participants annual base salary  that the participant maintains the full amount of Personally Invested Shares during the entire Vesting Period  and that the participant  with some exceptions  still is employed as per December 31  2025  and that the performance based condition has been fully achieved.The maximum number of Series B shares that a participant may nominate as Personally Invested Shares  and thus the total number of performance awards that may be allotted  shall be based on the market price for the company's Series B share. The total number of issued shares in the company amounts to 573 392 552 shares.Based on the assumption that the share price for the company's Series B share amounts to SEK 91  LTI 2023/2025 will  in accordance with the principles and assumptions set out above  comprise maximum 1 430 000 Series B shares in total  which corresponds to approximately 0.25 percent of the total number of issued shares in the company and 0.18 percent of the total number of votes in the company.The costs for LTI 2023/2025 should be expensed as personnel costs over the Vesting Period. Provided that the performance-based condition is fully achieved  the cost for LTI 2023/2025 before tax is  in accordance with the principles and assumptions set out above  estimated to approximately SEK 130 million  allocated over the Vesting Period. Estimated social security costs and financing costs are included in such amount.The Board proposes the AGM to resolve to authorize the Board to resolve on repurchase of shares in the company and to transfer such shares on a regulated market to cover social security costs and financing costs associated with LTI 2023/2025 (see separate item on the agenda).The costs for LTI 2023/2025 are expected to have marginal effect on key ratios of the Securitas Group.The Board deems that the positive effects on earnings that are expected to result from increased share ownership among senior management and key employees  which may be further increased through LTI 2023/2025  outweighs the costs related to LTI 2023/2025.All estimates are based on at each time applicable foreign exchange rates according to Reuters. Information on previous LTI Programs can be found in the Annual Report 2022  notes 9 and 12.Delivery of shares under LTI 2023/2025 and hedging measuresTo ensure the delivery of Series B shares under LTI 2023/2025  the company may enter into a share-swap agreement with a third party  whereby the third party in its own name shall acquire and transfer Series B shares in the company to employees participating in LTI 2023/2025. The cost for the swap is estimated at a maximum of SEK 600 000 assuming that the performance-based condition is fully achieved.Preparation of the proposal and voting majorityLTI 2023/2025 has been initiated by the Board and the Remuneration Committee of Securitas in consultation with major shareholders and has been structured in consultation with external advisers based on an evaluation of previous incentive schemes. LTI 2023/2025 has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee and reviewed at meetings of the Board. The resolution must be supported by shareholders representing more than half of the votes cast  or  in case of equal voting  supported by the Chair of the AGM.Other informationAvailable documentation etc.The Annual Report and the Auditor's Report  the remuneration report and all other supporting documentation for the AGM are available at the company and on the company website www.securitas.com/agm2023 no later than three weeks before the AGM.The Nomination Committee's complete proposals and motivated statement are available at the company and on the company website www.securitas.com/agm2023.In addition  copies of the documentation will be sent to the shareholders who so request  indicating their mailing address.

Acquisition of Savings Shares shall be made through the company on Nasdaq Stockholm within twenty trading days from when the outcome of the variable cash remuneration program has been established and the participants have informed Eolus whether they want to participate in the Share Savings Program.Provided that the participant still holds all of the Savings Shares and is still employed within the Eolus group three years after the acquisition of Savings Shares  Eolus will remunerate the participant with an amount corresponding to the cost for acquiring the number of Eolus shares corresponding to half of the number of Savings Shares (‚ÄúMatching Shares‚Äù). Acquisition of Matching Shares shall be made through the company on Nasdaq Stockholm within twenty trading days from the date falling three years after the acquisition of Savings Shares.In order to ensure that the participant‚Äôs financial situation as far as possible shall remain unchanged  the number of Matching Shares shall be subject to customary recalculation should the company‚Äôs share capital increase or decrease  convertible debt instruments or options be issued or the company be liquidated or merged  or any similar changes to the company occur.Should the participant be prohibited from acquiring Savings Shares due to possession of inside information  the Board of Directors may in individual cases prolong or postpone the above mentioned investment period  although not beyond the next year end (i.e. until and including 31 December 2024). The Board of Directors shall be responsible for the detailed conditions and the administration of the Share Savings Program 2023 within the terms and conditions set forth above  and may also make such minor adjustments and applications as may be appropriate for legal or administrative reasons.Based on the assumptions of maximum outcome in the variable cash remuneration program  full investments by the entitled participants and an unchanged share price at the time of delivery of the Matching Shares  Eolus‚Äô costs relating to the Share Savings Program 2023 are estimated to amount to a maximum of approximately SEK 3.2 million. Assuming a 25 per cent increase in Eolus‚Äô share price at the time of delivery of Matching Shares  Eolus‚Äô costs relating to the Share Savings Program 2023  including employer contributions  are estimated to amount to a maximum of approximately SEK 4.0 million and assuming a 50 per cent increase in the share price at such time  the costs are estimated to amount to a maximum of approximately SEK 4.9 million  including employer contributions. The Share Savings Program 2023 does not result in any dilution of the holdings of the company‚Äôs shareholders and is not deemed to affect any performance measure important for Eolus. No measures have been taken to hedge Eolus‚Äô costs against its own share price in connection with the purchase of Matching shares.The proposal on Share Savings Program 2023 has been prepared by the Board of Directors and the Remuneration Committee. In the company  similar share savings programs for the financial years 2022  2021 and 2019/2020 relating to the variable cash remuneration have previously been adopted. By requiring  as described above  that the participants make an own investment in Eolus shares and thereby reconciling the employees‚Äô and the shareholders‚Äô interests of a long-term increase of the company‚Äôs value  the Share Savings Program 2023 is expected to enhance Eolus‚Äô possibilities to recruit and retain competent employees while at the same time promoting Eolus‚Äô business strategy  long-term interests and sustainability.The proposal must be supported by shareholders representing more than half of the votes cast at the general meeting.Available documentationThe Nomination Committee‚Äôs reasoned statement  form of power of attorney and postal voting form are available at the company and on the company‚Äôs website  www.eolusvind.com/en/.The financial statements  the audit report and other documentation that shall be available for the shareholders according to the Swedish Companies Act will be available at the company and on the company‚Äôs website  www.eolusvind.com/en/  no later than three weeks before the AGM.The documents will be sent free of charge to shareholders who so request and state their address.Number of shares and votes in the companyAt the time of issue of this convening notice  the total number of shares in the company amounts to 24 907 000  of which 1 285 625 shares are Class A shares and 23 621 375 shares are Class B shares.

The demerger plan is available on Sampo plc‚Äôs website at www.sampo.com/agm .Pursuant to the demerger plan  Sampo plc will demerge in a partial demerger so that all of the shares in Mandatum Holding Ltd (a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of Sampo plc) owned by Sampo plc and related assets and liabilities will transfer without a liquidation procedure to Mandatum plc  a company to be incorporated in the demerger.The purpose of the demerger is to implement the divestment of the life insurance  wealth management business and related operations carried out by Mandatum Holding Ltd through its direct and indirect subsidiaries in order to form a new independent group of companies. The planned date of registration of the completion of the partial demerger is 1 October 2023 (the ‚ÄúEffective Date‚Äù). The actual Effective Date may change from said planned date in accordance with the demerger plan.However  despite the resolution of the General Meeting  the Board of Directors of Sampo plc may resolve to not complete the demerger if at any time prior to the completion of the demerger there exists in the view of the Board of Directors of Sampo plc grounds due to which such non-completion would be appropriate.In accordance to the demerger plan  the shareholders of Sampo plc shall receive as demerger consideration one (1) new share in Mandatum plc for each share (regardless of share class) owned in Sampo plc  i.e. the demerger consideration shall be issued to the shareholders of Sampo plc in proportion to their shareholdings with a ratio of 1:1. For the sake of clarity  the demerger consideration shall be delivered through the book-entry system without any separate action being required from the shareholders of Sampo plc in relation thereto.The shares in Mandatum plc are intended to be admitted to trading on the official list of Nasdaq Helsinki Ltd. Trading is intended to begin on the Effective Date  or in case the Effective Date does not fall on a trading day  the first potential trading day following the Effective Date.As part of the demerger resolution the Annual General Meeting resolves on  conditional upon the registration of the completion of the demerger:The establishment of Mandatum plc and the approval of its articles of associationThe receiving company in the demerger is established in connection with the registration of the completion of the demerger. It has been proposed that the trade name of the company be Mandatum Oyj (in English: Mandatum plc)  and the company‚Äôs proposed articles of association are included in full as an appendix to the demerger plan.The proposed articles of association of Mandatum plc are  to the extent applicable  based on Sampo plc‚Äôs currently valid Articles of Association  taking into consideration the amendments proposed to the Articles of Association in agenda items 17 and 18 below.The composition of Mandatum plc‚Äôs Board of Directors and the selection of its auditor as well as their remunerationAccording to the proposed articles of association of Mandatum plc  the Board of Directors of Mandatum plc shall consist of three (3) to ten (10) members. It is proposed that Mandatum plc‚Äôs Board of Directors is elected in accordance with the demerger plan approved and signed by Sampo plc‚Äôs Board of Directors on 29 March 2023  wherein the composition of the Board of Directors of Mandatum plc is described in detail.The term of such members of the Board of Directors shall commence on the Effective Date and shall expire at the end of the first Annual General Meeting of Mandatum plc following the Effective Date. The Board of Directors of Mandatum plc may however take certain decisions on behalf of Mandatum plc already prior to the Effective Date  as set forth in the demerger plan.Prior to assuming the duties of a Board member of Mandatum plc  each such person must fulfil the Fitness & Propriety requirements set by the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority.It is proposed that each member of the Board of Directors of Mandatum plc be remunerated in accordance with the demerger plan approved and signed by Sampo plc‚Äôs Board of Directors on 29 March 2023.According to the proposed articles of association of Mandatum plc  Mandatum plc shall have one (1) auditor which must be an auditing firm authorised by the Finnish Patent and Registration Office. In accordance with the demerger plan approved and signed by Sampo plc's Board of Directors on 29 March 2023  it is therefore proposed that the firm of authorised public accountants Deloitte Ltd be elected as the Mandatum plc‚Äôs auditor for the financial year 2023. If Deloitte Ltd is elected as Mandatum plc‚Äôs auditor  the firm has announced that APA Reeta Virolainen will act as the auditor with principal responsibility. APA Reeta Virolainen has acted as Mandatum Group‚Äôs principally responsible auditor since 2021. Sampo plc‚Äôs Board of Directors also proposes that compensation be paid to Mandatum plc‚Äôs auditor against an invoice approved by Mandatum plc.The establishment of a shareholders‚Äô nomination board for Mandatum plcIt is proposed to establish a shareholders‚Äô nomination board for Mandatum plc in accordance with the demerger plan approved and signed by Sampo plc‚Äôs Board of Directors on 29 March 2023.Resolutions that are conditional on the completion of the demerger will enter into force in connection with the registration of the completion of the demerger.17.

However  conditional upon the Annual General Meeting approving the proposal made to it by the Board of Directors regarding the authorisation for the Board of Directors to resolve upon a share issue without payment (share split) in accordance with agenda item 20  and the Board of Directors resolving on the share issue without payment  a maximum of 300 000 000 Sampo plc A shares may be repurchased  representing approximately 9.7 per cent of all outstanding Sampo plc A shares after the shares issued in a share issue without payment in accordance with agenda item 20 have been registered.

Authorising the Board of Directors to resolve upon a share issue without paymentThe Board of Directors proposes to the Annual General Meeting that the Annual General Meeting resolves to authorise the Board of Directors to resolve upon a share issue without payment in proportion to shares owned by shareholders (share split) based on the following terms in order to enhance share liquidity. The Board of Directors could then resolve upon the timing and execution of the share issue without payment at its discretion and based on the then prevailing market conditions  for example also considering the potential completion of the partial demerger of Sampo plc as proposed by the Board of Directors under agenda item 16.Based on the proposed authorisation  the Board of Directors could resolve to issue new shares to all shareholders without payment in proportion to their holdings so that a maximum of five (5) new A shares would be issued for each current A share and a maximum of five (5) new B shares would be issued for each current B share. The Board of Directors would be authorised to decide the exact amount of new shares issued for each A share and each B share within the limits of the proposed maximum number of new shares such that the ratio of current shares to new shares would be the same for both classes of shares. Based on the number of shares on the date of this Notice  a maximum of 2 554 888 845 new A shares and a maximum of 1 000 000 new B shares would be issued. The shares would be issued to shareholders who would be registered in the Company‚Äôs shareholders‚Äô register maintained by Euroclear Finland Oy on the record date of the share issue. The share issue without payment would be executed in the book-entry system and would not require any action from the shareholders. The new A shares would be converted into SDRs in accordance with sections 7.1 and 7.2 of the General Terms and Conditions for the SDRs and would not require any action from SDR holders. The new shares would generate shareholders rights as of when they have been registered in the trade register.The Board of Directors would be authorised to decide on the record date of the share issue in accordance with applicable and valid legislation. The authorisation is proposed to remain valid until the next Annual General Meeting of Sampo plc  however at the latest until 30 June 2024.21. Closing of the meetingB.

The Associated Press reported that the largest part of th,"Members of the US and Iranian delegations before the judges of the International Court of Justice in The Hague (AP)London - The Hague - Asharq Al-AwsatThe International Court of Justice (ICJ) has rejected Iran's legal bid to release about $2 billion owned by the Markazi Bank frozen by the US.The Associated Press reported that the largest part of the case focused on Bank Markazi and its frozen assets of $1.75 billion in bonds and accumulated interest in a Citibank account in New York.The court said it did not have jurisdiction based on the 1955 Treaty of Amity because its protections do not extend to central banks.The highest UN judicial body  based in The Hague  said it did not have jurisdiction to rule on the Iranian claim linked to the Markazi Bank but considered that Washington ""violated"" the rights of Iranian individuals and companies and must compensate them  according to AFP.Reuters described the ruling as a ""partial victory"" for Iran  saying Washington had illegally allowed courts to freeze assets of some Iranian companies and ordered the United States to pay compensation but left the amount to be determined later.The case before the ICJ was initially brought by Iran against the US in 2016. Tehran alleged Washington breached a 1955 friendship treaty by allowing US courts to freeze the assets of Iranian companies.The assets should be paid to victims of attacks blamed on Tehran  including the 1983 bombing of a US Marine barracks in Beirut.Acting legal adviser Rich Visek of the US State Department said the court had ""rejected the vast majority of Iran's case "" saying it was a ""major victory.""Visek stated: ""This is a major victory for the United States and victims of Iran's state-sponsored terrorism.""In response  the Iranian Foreign Ministry said that the ""verdict... shows once again the legitimacy"" of Iran's positions ""and the illegal behavior of the United States.""The complex 67-page ruling comes amid escalating tensions between Washington and Tehran  following exchanged attacks between Iranian-backed militants and US forces in Syria last week.Relations were strained after Russia's use of Iranian drones against Ukraine  and efforts to revive the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and major world powers stalled.Shortly after its 2018 withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal  Washington announced it would formally end the 1955 treaty.The US Supreme Court ruled that money from Iran's central bank could be used as compensation for the 241 US troops who died in the 1983 bombing that targeted a military base  which was believed to be linked to Tehran.Iran denies responsibility for the terror attacks alleged by Washington.The ICJ rulings are binding and not subject to appeal but have no enforcement powers. Countries can resort to the Security Council if another country does not comply with a resolution.The United States and Iran are among a handful of countries that have previously disregarded its decisions.Earlier this month  New York District Judge Loretta Preska ordered Iran's central bank and a European intermediary to pay out $1.68 billion to family members of the troops killed in the 1983 car bombing of the US Marine Corps barracks in Lebanon.Victims and their families won a $2.65 billion judgment against Iran in federal court in 2007 over the attack.Six years later  they sought to seize bond proceeds allegedly owned by Bank Markazi and processed by Clearstream to satisfy the court judgment partially.Bank Markazi argued that the lawsuit was not permitted under the Foreign Sovereign Immunity Act (FSIA)  which generally protects foreign governments from liability in US courts.Preska said the 2019 law authorizes US courts to allow the seizure of assets outside the country to satisfy judgments against Iran in terrorism cases  ""notwithstanding"" other laws such as FSIA that would grant immunity.A Luxembourg court in 2021 ordered Clearstream not to move the funds until a court in that country recognizes the US ruling. Clearstream has appealed that decision.Information about frozen Iran assets abroad is conflicting. Some unofficial estimates put it between $100 billion and $120 billion.The former governor of the Markazi Bank of Iran  Valiollah Seif  said that after the nuclear deal was announced in 2015  the agreement would release $30 billion of Iran's frozen assets.Iran is currently demanding the release of the frozen funds in South Korean and Japanese banks that were being used to pay for oil imports and the export of goods  and the revenues from the sale of gas and electricity in Iraq.",negative,0.01,0.4,0.6,negative,0.0,0.12,0.88,True,English,"['ICJ', 'Iran', 'Bid', 'Assets', 'US', 'New York District Judge Loretta Preska', 'highest UN judicial body', 'legal adviser Rich Visek', 'Foreign Sovereign Immunity Act', 'US Marine Corps barracks', 'The US Supreme Court', 'US Marine barracks', 'The Associated Press', 'US State Department', 'Iranian Foreign Ministry', 'complex 67-page ruling', 'major world powers', 'The ICJ rulings', 'The International Court', 'The United States', 'Iran nuclear deal', 'legal bid', 'foreign governments', 'The Hague', '2015 nuclear deal', 'enforcement powers', 'major victory', 'US forces', 'US ruling', 'Iranian delegations', 'Iranian claim', 'Iranian individuals', 'Iranian drones', 'Asharq Al-Awsat', 'Markazi Bank', 'largest part', 'Bank Markazi', 'Citibank account', 'central banks', 'partial victory', 'vast majority', 'state-sponsored terrorism', 'illegal behavior', 'escalating tensions', 'Iranian-backed militants', 'military base', 'Security Council', 'European intermediary', '$2.65 billion judgment', 'federal court', 'bond proceeds', 'court judgment', 'terrorism cases', 'other laws', 'Luxembourg court', 'unofficial estimates', 'former governor', 'Valiollah Seif', 'South Korean', 'Japanese banks', 'oil imports', 'US courts', 'Iranian companies', '241 US troops', 'family members', 'frozen funds', '1955 friendship treaty', 'terror attacks', '1983 car bombing', 'frozen assets', 'Iran assets', '1955 Treaty', '1983 bombing', 'judges', 'Justice', 'London', 'bonds', 'interest', 'jurisdiction', 'Amity', 'protections', 'Washington', 'rights', 'AFP', 'Reuters', 'compensation', 'amount', 'Tehran', 'victims', 'Beirut', 'response', 'verdict', 'legitimacy', 'positions', 'Syria', 'Relations', 'Russia', 'use', 'Ukraine', 'efforts', '2018 withdrawal', 'money', 'responsibility', 'appeal', 'Countries', 'country', 'resolution', 'handful', 'decisions', 'Lebanon', 'families', 'Clearstream', 'lawsuit', 'FSIA', 'liability', '2019 law', 'seizure', 'judgments', 'Information', 'agreement', 'release', 'export', 'goods', 'revenues', 'sale', 'gas', 'electricity', 'Iraq']",2023-03-31,2023-03-31,english.aawsat.com

Especially with our activities in the regions of North America and Asia  we were able to achieve strong growth rates in terms of sales of around 57% and around 66%  respectively  compared to 2021. We set yet another milestone in our expansion course in February this year by expanding our business activities in India. The order situation has remained dynamic in the first months of 2023 and gives us reason to be optimistic for the rest of the year and beyond. With our products  we make a very important contribution to improving our customers‚Äô carbon footprint. These efforts pay into the long-term climate targets set by society and governments that must be achieved to ensure a responsible  ecological future. This transformation toward clean energy generation is no longer based solely on ecological conviction  however  but has also taken on a new dimension with the unfortunate geopolitical changes we are seeing. Reducing dependence on fossil fuels will therefore become a mandatory priority in many countries in the years to come. With our technology  we hold a key to making the energy supply more ecological  more environmentally friendly  and yet still reliable. This opens up huge opportunities for SFC Energy and we expect to be able to continue accelerating our growth trajectory. Investment and subsidy programs worth billions of euros at both the national and international level will also help facilitate the necessary energy turnaround ‚Äù commented Dr. Peter Podesser  CEO of SFC Energy AG.Development of salesIn fiscal year 2022  the SFC Energy Group generated significant sales growth of 32.5% to EUR 85 229 thousand (2021: EUR 64 320 thousand). This gratifying development in a challenging environment resulted from growth in both segments  but especially in the Clean Energy segment  which achieved a particularly strong increase in sales of 35.8% due to sustained high demand for fuel cells. Overall  Group sales were thus above the forecast range of EUR 81 000 thousand to EUR 83 000 thousand in 2022.Sales by segments in EUR thousand 2022 2021 Clean Energy 57 632 42 428 Clean Power Management 27 597 21 892 Total 85 229 64 320Development of the segmentsThe Clean Energy segment in particular continued to benefit from even faster market growth and high demand for fuel cells in the reporting year. Sales increased significantly by 35.8% to EUR 57 632 thousand in 2022 compared to EUR 42 428 thousand in the previous year. Sales increased in particular in the area of industrial applications  which address the core target markets of ‚Äúcivil security technology ‚Äù ‚Äúdata transmission and digitalization ‚Äù among others  and accounted for the highest share of segment sales. In this context  the increased contribution to sales from the North America region in particular also had a positive impact on the growth of the segment. Sales of fuel cell solutions in the core target markets for private applications remained at approximately the same level as the previous year  while sales for applications in the core target markets for public safety  which accounted for the smallest share of segment sales  fell sharply. One key reason for this is the public safety market  which is generally dominated by project business. Here  there are only a few major projects whose timing of award and delivery has a significant impact on annual sales in this end customer market. At 67.6% (previous year: 66.0%)  the Clean Energy segment managed to expand its share of total Group sales even further.Sales in the Clean Power Management segment also showed significant growth of 26.1% to EUR 27 597 thousand in the reporting year (previous year: EUR 21 892 thousand). This growth was mainly based on recovering demand from current customers in the oil  gas and mining end customer market as a result of the significant increase in the price of crude oil and the improved market environment in the reporting year. Clean Power Management accounted for 32.4% of Group sales in the reporting year (previous year: 34.0%).Due to the strong demand dynamics in the reporting year  order intake increased significantly to EUR 127 195 thousand (previous year: EUR 89 087 thousand). Accordingly  the Group‚Äôs order backlog increased to EUR 74 176 thousand as of December 31  2022 (December 31  2021: EUR 30 552 thousand).Development of earningsIn the reporting year  both the increased sales contribution from the higher-margin Clean Energy segment and the segment‚Äôs gross profit margin  which was slightly higher than in the previous year  led to a 38.7% increase in consolidated gross profit to EUR 31 406 thousand (previous year: EUR 22 638 thousand). The resulting gross profit margin of the Group (gross profit as a percentage of sales) improved slightly to 36.8% (previous year: 35.2%).Gross profit for the individual segments compared to the previous year is as follows:Gross profit by segment in EURthousand 2022 2021 Clean Energy 24 531 17 011 Clean Power Management 6 875 5 627 Total 31 406 22 638EBITDA adjusted for non-recurring effects increased significantly in the reporting year to EUR 8 150 thousand (previous year: EUR 6 233 thousand) and was thus slightly above the middle of the forecast range of EUR 7 500 thousand to EUR 8 500 thousand. At 9.6%  the adjusted EBITDA margin was approximately at the level of the previous year (9.7%). EBIT adjusted for non-recurring effects increased significantly year-on-year to EUR 3 157 thousand (previous year: EUR 1 925 thousand) and was thus also within the target range of the Management Board‚Äôs expectations (EUR 2 600 thousand to EUR 3 600 thousand). This resulted in a slightly higher adjusted EBIT margin of 3.7% (previous year: 3.0%). The reporting year closed with a consolidated net result for the period of EUR 2 020 thousand (previous year: EUR -5 829 thousand). Basic and diluted earnings per share according to IFRS improved significantly to EUR 0.13 in the reporting year 2022 (previous year: EUR -0.40).Balance sheetThe equity ratio increased to 70.3% in the reporting year (December 31  2021: 57.3%). The net financial position (freely available cash and cash equivalents less liabilities to banks) increased to EUR 60 748 thousand as of the balance sheet date 2022 (December 31  2021: EUR 21 888 thousand) due to the capital increase carried out in the reporting year. As of December 31  2022  the SFC Energy Group had 354 permanent employees (December 31  2021: 298).Cash flow from operating activities before changes in net working capital and income taxes (the operating result before changes in working capital) amounted to EUR 8 742 thousand in the reporting year (previous year: EUR 5 977 thousand) and was thus significantly higher than in the previous year. After taking the change in net working capital into account  which increased by EUR 13 263 thousand in the year under review (previous year: EUR 4 567 thousand) with an effect on liquidity  and income tax payments  cash flow from operating activities amounted to EUR -4 761 thousand (previous year: EUR 1 078 thousand). The main reason for this high decrease was the increase in net working capital  mainly due to the increase in inventories.Forecast for 2023Based on how positively the business developed in 2022 with historic records achieved once again in a challenging general environment as well as the strong demand  the Management Board expects 2023 to develop dynamically as well.SalesFor the current fiscal year  the Management Board expects Group sales to increase by 21% to 30% compared to the previous year to approximately EUR 103 million to EUR 111 million (fiscal year 2022: EUR 85.2 million)  which will be driven much more strongly by the Clean Energy segment. Overall  demand is expected to continue to rise in all regional markets in the reporting year 2023  with significant growth impetus coming from North America and Asia  in particular.Adjusted EBITDABolstered by the expected dynamic development of demand  but depending on the timing of the implementation of planned growth investments ‚Äì in particular in regional expansion and the extent of the expected burdens from increased material and procurement costs ‚Äì the Management Board expects a moderate contraction or slight expansion in the margin for fiscal year 2023. It is assumed that the higher costs can be passed on to customers to a certain extent. Adjusted EBITDA in fiscal year 2023 is therefore expected to be approximately between EUR 8.9 million and EUR 14.1 million (fiscal year 2022: EUR 8.2 million).Adjusted EBITBased on the planning of the Clean Energy and Clean Power Management segments  the Management Board expects adjusted EBIT for the Group in 2023 to be between EUR 3.4 million and EUR 8.6 million (fiscal year 2022: EUR 3.2 million).Key figures for 2022/2021in EUR thousand 01/01-12/31/2022 01/01-12/31/2021 Sales 85 229 64 320 Gross profit 31 406 22 638 Gross margin 36.8% 35.2% EBITDA 8 593 -797 EBITDA margin 10.1% -1.2% Adjusted EBITDA 8 150 6 233 Adjusted EBITDA margin 9.6% 9.7% EBIT 3 599 -5 105 EBIT margin 4.2% -7.9% Adjusted EBIT 3 157 1 925 Adjusted EBIT margin 3.7% 3.0% Consolidated net result for the period 2 020 -5 829 Order book* 74 176 30 552* As of December 31Detailed financial informationThe 2022 Annual Report of SFC Energy AG is available for download at www.sfc.com.SFC Energy AG will be holding a conference call for interested investors and journalists in English today  March 30  2023  at 9:00 a.m. Please send an email to susan.hoffmeister@sfc.com to register.About SFC Energy AGSFC Energy AG is a leading provider of hydrogen and methanol fuel cells for stationary and mobile hybrid power solutions.

This was agreed today by the Executive Board and the members of the committee (Pr√§sidium) of the supervisory board (Aufsichtsrat). Based on the number of 76 464 319 shares issued  this corresponds to an amount of ‚Ç¨ 191 160 797.50 to be distributed from the retained earnings of the 2022 financial year.The Company is also examining possibilities to further increase its ability to distribute  insofar as its liquidity situation permits this at the given time. To this end  the Company plans to release retained earnings of ‚Ç¨ 669.9 million in the financial statements for the 2022 financial year. In order to ensure that the Company maintains an adequate liquidity reserve (minimum liquidity) of currently ‚Ç¨ 100 million for the ongoing operation of its business  to meet the requirements of loan agreements with financing banks and for the implementation of planned investments in accordance with the respective current corporate planning  the Company has concluded a loan agreement with the major shareholder  Hercules BidCo GmbH  Hamburg  and thus a related party within the meaning of ¬ß 111a of the Stock Corporation Act (AktG). According to this agreement  Hercules BidCo GmbH grants an interest-free loan to the Company if a resolution on the appropriation of profits passed with its majority of votes at the upcoming or future annual general meetings of the Company should lead to a shortfall of the respective applicable minimum liquidity. The minimum liquidity that the executive board and the supervisory board deem appropriate is regularly reassessed on the basis of the corporate planning. The corresponding loan facility initially comprises ‚Ç¨ 500.0 million and has an indefinite period. The amount of the loan facility is reduced over the term by 50% of the annual profits (Jahres√ºberschuss) of the Company for the fiscal year 2023 and any consecutive fiscal years  dividend distributions resolved upon by the annual general meeting in agreement with proposals by the management as well as amounts added back to retained earnings based on resolutions by the annual general meeting. The loan agreement is still subject to the approval of the company's supervisory board (taking into account any conflicts of interest of individual supervisory board members). It is currently planned to obtain the approval of the supervisory board for the conclusion of the agreement at the latest at the next regular supervisory board meeting  which is scheduled for 25 April 2023 and at which a decision is also to be made with respect to the approval of the annual financial statements.The final resolution on the management's proposal to the annual general meeting on the appropriation of profits is to be passed only in connection with the convocation of the annual general meeting.

London Stock Exchange Group ,LONDON: Euronext will not mimic rivals by shifting critical services to outside cloud computers given regulatory concerns  the pan-European exchange‚Äôs chief executive Stephane Boujnah said.London Stock Exchange Group  CME and Nasdaq have all announced partnerships with cloud computing giants like Alphabet  Amazon and Microsoft  with Deutsche Boerse joining them on Thursday in a ‚Äústrategic partnership‚Äù with Google.‚ÄúOne of the reasons why we are cautious about the use of data centres of Microsoft  Google and Amazon for critical parts of what we do is because our core supervisors and regulators are themselves very cautious ‚Äù Boujnah told Reuters on Thursday.Euronext only uses a cloud provider for storing historical data  he said.‚ÄúWhen it comes to strategic applications such as real-time data and operations of the market  we do not want them to be stored and operated by the data centres of companies which have decision-making centres outside the EU  and physical infrastructure outside the EU ‚Äù Boujnah added.Euronext said earlier on Thursday it has postponed until further notice a weekly report on positions held in its commodity derivatives  as disruption from a ransomware attack on financial data firm ION Group outside the bloc continued.‚ÄúWe analyse very carefully the dependency on certain providers ‚Äù Boujnah said as Euronext reported full year earnings.Earlier this week  the Bank for International Settlements said a ‚Äúrethink‚Äù is needed on regulating how finance is becoming increasingly dependent on outside parties like cloud firms  which new EU rules will address.Euronext reported record full-year 2022 revenue and income of 1.418 billion euros ($1.52 billion)  up 9.3% on 2021 due to consolidating its acquisition of Borsa Italiana.Adjusted earnings per share in 2022 was down 4.8% at 5.21 euros due to higher share count  and the company proposes to pay a dividend of 2.22 euros per share.Euronext said it has increased its 2024 annual pre-tax savings related to integrating Borsa Italiana by 15 million euros to 115 million  with around 70 million of this achieved by the end of 2023 as implementation costs remain unchanged.The savings are nearly double what was promised at the deal‚Äôs outset.‚ÄúThis further demonstrates Euronext‚Äôs successful track record in integrating acquired companies ‚Äù Boujnah said.,neutral,0.03,0.81,0.17,mixed,0.29,0.19,0.52,True,English,"['cloud computing deal', 'Euronext', 'plans', 'rivals', 'London Stock Exchange Group', 'record full-year 2022 revenue', 'successful track record', 'cloud computing giants', 'financial data firm', 'outside cloud computers', 'full year earnings', '2024 annual pre-tax savings', 'new EU rules', 'higher share count', 'pan-European exchange', 'cloud provider', 'outside parties', 'cloud firms', 'data centres', 'historical data', 'real-time data', 'critical services', 'regulatory concerns', 'chief executive', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'strategic partnership', 'critical parts', 'core supervisors', 'strategic applications', 'decision-making centres', 'physical infrastructure', 'weekly report', 'commodity derivatives', 'ransomware attack', 'International Settlements', 'Borsa Italiana', 'implementation costs', '1.418 billion euros', '15 million euros', 'Stephane Boujnah', '5.21 euros', '2.22 euros', 'Euronext', 'rivals', 'CME', 'Nasdaq', 'partnerships', 'Alphabet', 'Amazon', 'Microsoft', 'Thursday', 'Google', 'reasons', 'use', 'regulators', 'Reuters', 'operations', 'market', 'companies', 'positions', 'disruption', 'bloc', 'dependency', 'providers', 'Bank', 'rethink', 'finance', 'income', 'acquisition', 'company', 'deal', 'outset']",2023-03-31,2023-03-31,brecorder.com

(EURONEXT: UMG) announced today that its Board of Directors has extended the engagement of UMG Chairman and Chief Executive...,"HILVERSUM  Netherlands  March 30  2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Universal Music Group N.V. (EURONEXT: UMG) announced today that its Board of Directors has extended the engagement of UMG Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sir Lucian Grainge until May 1  2028.(PRNewsfoto/Universal Music Group)""UMG is the world's most successful music company and there are incredible opportunities ahead for a company with the right leadership and vision "" said Sherry Lansing  UMG's Chairman of the Board. ""The UMG Board is resolutely committed to converting those opportunities and maximizing shareholder value for the long term. Only the right kind of chief executive can help achieve that goal and Lucian is just the one to do it. Through his clear vision and strong execution in building UMG into the industry leader  Lucian has also essentially created a new category of music company. This agreement is designed to drive both the sustainable success of UMG and long-term shareholder value.""The extended and amended agreement transitions Grainge from an all-cash compensation package to one that is a combination of equity and cash and includes an equity compensation program with a broad set of performance-based objectives aligned with shareholders' interest and corresponding to the Company's long-term growth strategy.To assure the compensation program is aligned with shareholders' interest  the majority of the compensation package's economic value will be paid in UMG equity and UMG performance-based stock options.Grainge's annual salary under the new agreement will be reduced by more than two-thirds from his current salary‚Äîto $5 million. Subject to the achievement of performance criteria  he will be eligible for an annual bonus with a target of $10 million. The EBITA bonus from his prior employment agreement has been eliminated and Grainge will only be entitled to the contingent bonus under his prior employment agreement on a pro rata basis until March 31  2023.Story continuesThe equity components of the program include annual grants of $20 million  comprised of as much as 50% Performance Share Units (PSUs)‚Äîwith annual PSU goals set by the Board of Directors‚Äîand the remainder comprised of Restricted Share Units (RSUs). As part of the Long-Term Incentive Plan  Grainge will receive a one-time transition equity award of $100 million  of which 50% will be in the form of RSUs and 50% in the form of Performance Stock Options (PSOs). The PSOs will only be paid out if the Company surpasses stock price hurdles (1/3rd at ‚Ç¨26.50  another 1/3rd at ‚Ç¨30.00 and 1/3rd at ‚Ç¨38.00) within the term of the agreement ending May 1  2028.The size of the potential equity grant falls within the parameters for potential equity grants as previously disclosed and voted on by shareholders at UMG's 2022 Annual General Meeting in the Company's 2022 Global Equity Plan and UMG's Executive Directors Remuneration Policy.To align Grainge's term as executive director and Chairman and CEO of UMG with the term of the extended employment agreement‚Äîending on May 1  2028‚Äîthe Board will put to UMG's General Meeting a proposal to reappoint Grainge as executive director for a term ending on May 1  2028. For further information on this proposal (and the proposal below)  please see the Investor Relations section of the UMG website (https://investors.universalmusic.com/).The Board will also seek approval at UMG's 2023 Annual General Meeting for a supplement to UMG's existing Executive Directors Remuneration Policy with respect to Grainge's new remuneration.Further discussion of UMG's compensation programs and their use of equity- and performance-based compensation‚Äîincluding the Global Equity Plan approved by shareholders in 2022‚Äîis posted in the Investor Relations section of the UMG website (https://investors.universalmusic.com/) and included in the Remuneration Report of the Company's Annual Report to Shareholders.About Universal Music GroupAt Universal Music Group (EURONEXT: UMG)  we exist to shape culture through the power of artistry.

We have successfully completed the first major milestone of our 'Growth for Impact 2024' strategic plan with the migration of our Core Data Centre. Our achievements in 2022 pave the way for the next steps to be delivered in 2023 and 2024.These are the critical bricks to complete our presence across the integrated value chain  allowing us to innovate and shape capital markets in line with evolving client needs  and making Euronext even stronger to deliver future growth. ""Dear Shareholders 2022 was a critical year for Euronext  and for Europe. The military invasion of Ukraine by Russia has demonstrated very clearly the need for reinforced European cooperation and a strengthened European Union. At Euronext  we are committed to our European roots and to our global ambitions. We know that cooperation across Europe is vital to secure prosperity and peace among the European nations that have pooled their destiny in common. The challenges our continent is facing is a reminder to us all of the common values we defend  as we continue to build the leading pan-European market infrastructure.In 2022  Euronext reached record revenue resulting from the strong performance of our non-volume related activities  together with efficient management of revenue capture and of cash trading market share. Thanks to our trademark cost discipline  we reported lower costs than our 2022 cost guidance. As a result  we achieved an adjusted EBITDA of ‚Ç¨861.6 million  which translated into an adjusted EPS of ‚Ç¨5.21. Consequently  we will propose a total dividend of ‚Ç¨236.6 million  or ‚Ç¨2.22 per share  at our next annual general meeting to be held in May 2023.We celebrated in April 2022 the one-year anniversary of the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group  a turning point in the history of Euronext. A lot has been accomplished and 2022 has been critical to the integration. We are proud that some of the key milestones of our 'Growth for Impact 2024' strategic plan have already been successfully completed. We also confirmed that all the Euronext strategic projects are progressing well. The migration of the Euronext Core Data Centre from Basildon in the United Kingdom to Bergamo in Italy on 6 June 2022 was one of our most strategic and ambitious projects. It was delivered smoothly  on schedule and on budget. 25% of the equity trading in Europe is now handled every day within our new green Core Data Centre located in the European Union.Throughout the year  we continued to consolidate our leadership position in the listing and trading of equities in Europe  and as the first debt listing venue worldwide. In 2022  Euronext welcomed 83 new equity listings to its seven listing venues across Europe  half of which were Tech companies. As part of the integration of the Borsa Italiana Group  we also introduced a new listing framework in Italy  harmonised with Group and global standards to simplify access to financing for local and international issuers.In 2023  we will bring the Italian markets to our single trading platform  Optiq¬Æ  creating the deepest liquidity pool in Europe  and strengthening the leading European listing platform. Euronext Clearing will become the clearing house of choice for Euronext cash equity markets in Q4 2023  and the clearing house for listed derivatives and commodities markets in Q3 2024. This strategic transformation will allow Euronext to directly manage these key client services and provide a harmonised and internalised clearing framework across all Euronext venues. Our good progress on the Borsa Italiana integration programme allowed us to upgrade our 2024 annual run-rate synergy targets to ‚Ç¨115 million.Another major step in our ESG commitment was achieved in 2022. In June  we published ambitious Euronext carbon footprint reduction targets to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions in alignment with the Paris Agreement. Our targets were validated by the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) at the beginning of 2023. Our new green Core Data Centre is a major step in achieving Euronext's ESG goals  allowing us to reduce our own carbon footprint while also enabling our colocation clients to lower their environmental impact.2022 has once again demonstrated our ability to deliver key strategic migrations on time  on budget  and with excellent results. 2023 will be another transformational year for Euronext.

The modules  which will be delivered up to 2028  will power US projects developed by EDP Renewables North America.TEMPE  Ariz. and HOUSTON  Texas  March 30  2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- First Solar   Inc. (NASDAQ: FSLR) and EDP Renewables (Euronext: EDPR) today announced a multi-year order for 1.8 gigawatts (GWdc) of First Solar‚Äôs advanced thin film photovoltaic (PV) solar modules. The modules  which will be delivered up to 2028  will power US projects developed by EDP Renewables North America (EDPR NA).EDP Renewables is a leading global pure renewable energy company that operates in 28 markets around the globe. North America is the company‚Äôs biggest market in terms of installed capacity and production  where the company currently operates 475 MW of solar projects  has 1.6 GW of solar capacity under construction  and has a robust solar development pipeline across the continent. In addition  EDPR operates more than 200 distributed generation solar sites throughout North America.

It is the only one of the world‚Äôs ten largest solar manufacturers to be a member of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA)  the world‚Äôs largest industry coalition dedicated to supporting the rights and well-being of workers and communities in the global supply chain  and the company has zero tolerance for forced labor in its manufacturing or its supply chains. First Solar‚Äôs modules have the lowest carbon and water footprint of any commercially available PV module today and the company is the first PV manufacturer to have its product included in the Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT) global registry for sustainable electronics.Story continues‚ÄúWe welcome EDP Renewables‚Äô decision to power its projects with our technology and look forward to supporting its growth in the US and  potentially  beyond ‚Äù said Mark Widmar  chief executive officer  First Solar. ‚ÄúEDP Renewables joins a growing roster of large  sophisticated developers choosing long-term pricing and supply certainty  and responsibly produced solar modules by powering their projects with First Solar‚Äôs technology. This validates the value that our customers place in our differentiation  not just in technology but our way of doing business.‚ÄùWith this strategic agreement  EDPR de-risks its solar pipeline in the US by securing equipment for its expected growth in the utility and distributed generation segments. Additionally  this allows EDPR to increase its commitment to local content in the US  while also pursuing its strategy of supply chain and technology diversification. The partnership between both companies started in 2019  when EDPR acquired a 50% stake in a 278 MW solar portfolio developed by First Solar.First Solar is expanding its US manufacturing footprint  which currently stands at more than 5 GW of annual nameplate capacity with three operating factories in Ohio. The company is expected to reach more than 10 GW by 2025  when it completes its new $1.1 billion factory in Alabama and a $185 million expansion of its existing capacity in Ohio.

The growth in net sales was mainly driven by Estetrol's sales for Mithra  strong demand for Turku's products  a favorable EUR/USD exchange rate  and the impact of price increase initiatives launched in recent months to cope with the sharp rise in the cost of raw materials and energy.It should be noted that  due to some overdue receivables observed since the summer 2022 and which have remained since then  PCAS decided to take appropriate legal action against its customer Mithra at the end of 2022 in order to collect these unpaid receivables. The total amount of receivables due by this customer amounted to ‚Ç¨31.1 million at December 31  2022 (including ‚Ç¨13.6 million of overdue receivables).Story continuesNet sales of Fine Specialty Chemicals totaled ‚Ç¨82.7 million  a 22.7% increase compared to 2021 (+18.6% at constant exchange rates). Business was very strong throughout the year with very strong demand for Electronics and Cosmetics  as well as a positive trend in Lubricants and Fine Chemicals. The increase in raw material and energy costs could be passed through to customers and thus contributed to the growth in net sales. The industrialization of new products also benefitted from a very good momentum.EBITDA of the PCAS Group totaled 2.2 million euros in 2022 against -4.6 million euros in 2021.Current operating income amounted to -‚Ç¨27.7 million in 2022  compared to -28.2 million euros in 2021.These results continue to show substantial losses  still negatively affected by a level of activity which is still not sufficient to cover the fixed costs incurred at several Pharmaceutical Synthesis sites  and the inventory depreciations linked to non-compliant products.Other operating income and expenses include an impairment of goodwill of ‚Ç¨14.5 million  already recognized in the half-yearly financial statements at June 30  2022.The financial result showed a loss of ‚Ç¨3.1 million in 2022  against -‚Ç¨2.9 million in 2021.Note that in 2021 the tax expense included an expense of ‚Ç¨6.3 million due to the cancellation of deferred tax assets on tax loss carryforwards  following a lower profit forecast for the years to come for the Group's French entities.The PCAS Group's net income was a loss of ‚Ç¨48.8 million in 2022  compared to a loss of ‚Ç¨40.5 million in 2021.The Group's net debt (including Seqens net current accounts) totaled ‚Ç¨228.4 million vs. ‚Ç¨172.7 million as of December 31  2021  as a result of the additional financing from Seqens via the current accounts of the losses and investments of the year.OutlookIn the context of the current dispute with Mithra  PCAS has no option but to consider a temporary reduction of the activity in 2023 at the production site concerned  since some of its workshops are dedicated to the production of Estetrol. At this stage  it is not possible to accurately assess the consequences this dispute may have on future business forecasts and results.Consequently  the return to positive results announced for 2023 is postponed.PCAS Group continues to benefit from the support of its majority shareholder Seqens (76.66%) for the financing of its activities and its development.NEXT FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE:Q1 2023 Net Sales  April 24  2023ABOUT PCASPCAS specializes in the development and production of complex molecules for life sciences and innovative technologies. With about 11% of its net sales earmarked for R&D and a large international footprint  PCAS is the preferred industrial partner for market-leading major global groups. Boasting especially high standards  the company offers a growing range of proprietary products and solutions in leading-edge segments. PCAS generated net sales of ‚Ç¨226.4 million in 2022 and employs nearly 1200 people in six countries.To find out more about PCAS: www.pcas.comPCAS NewCapJean-Louis Martin / Eric MoissenotEmmanuel Huynh / Louis-Victor Delouvrier NewCapFinancial communication and investor relation Tel.: +33 1 69 79 60 00www.pcas.com Tel.: +33 1 44 71 98 53pcas@newcap.euAPPENDIXDefinition of EBITDA and reconciliation of EBITDA with Current Operating IncomeDefinition of EBITDADefined as the current operating income plus amortization of tangible and intangible assets and net variations in provisions (including net allocations to provisions for inventories  excluding reversal of provisions on destroyed inventories recorded in consumed purchases and net provisions for employee benefits recorded in personal costs) and depreciation of goodwill.EBITDA is not a measurement of performance defined by IFRS standards and should not be considered to be an alternative to operating profit from ordinary activities or net profits (as calculated in accordance with IFRS standards) to measure the operational performance of PCAS  to cash flow resulting from current operations  generated by investments or resulting from financial operations (as calculated in accordance with IFRS standards) to measure the capacity of PCAS to meet its cash flow requirements or to any other performance measurement defined by IFRS standards. PCAS considers that EBITDA is a measurement that is frequently indicated and widely used by investors and other interested parties as a measurement of the operational performance of PCAS and its debt service capacity insofar as it makes it possible to make a constant comparison of performance without taking into account amortization expenses  which may vary significantly depending on the accounting methods used (particularly in the event of acquisitions) or non-operational factors (such as historical cost).

The growth in net sales was mainly driven by Estetrol's sales for Mithra  strong demand for Turku's products  a favorable EUR/USD exchange rate  and the impact of price increase initiatives launched in recent months to cope with the sharp rise in the cost of raw materials and energy.It should be noted that  due to some overdue receivables observed since the summer 2022 and which have remained since then  PCAS decided to take appropriate legal action against its customer Mithra at the end of 2022 in order to collect these unpaid receivables. The total amount of receivables due by this customer amounted to ‚Ç¨31.1 million at December 31  2022 (including ‚Ç¨13.6 million of overdue receivables).Net sales of Fine Specialty Chemicals totaled ‚Ç¨82.7 million  a 22.7% increase compared to 2021 (+18.6% at constant exchange rates). Business was very strong throughout the year with very strong demand for Electronics and Cosmetics  as well as a positive trend in Lubricants and Fine Chemicals. The increase in raw material and energy costs could be passed through to customers and thus contributed to the growth in net sales. The industrialization of new products also benefitted from a very good momentum.EBITDA of the PCAS Group totaled 2.2 million euros in 2022 against -4.6 million euros in 2021.Current operating income amounted to -‚Ç¨27.7 million in 2022  compared to -28.2 million euros in 2021.These results continue to show substantial losses  still negatively affected by a level of activity which is still not sufficient to cover the fixed costs incurred at several Pharmaceutical Synthesis sites  and the inventory depreciations linked to non-compliant products.Other operating income and expenses include an impairment of goodwill of ‚Ç¨14.5 million  already recognized in the half-yearly financial statements at June 30  2022.The financial result showed a loss of ‚Ç¨3.1 million in 2022  against -‚Ç¨2.9 million in 2021.Note that in 2021 the tax expense included an expense of ‚Ç¨6.3 million due to the cancellation of deferred tax assets on tax loss carryforwards  following a lower profit forecast for the years to come for the Group's French entities.The PCAS Group's net income was a loss of ‚Ç¨48.8 million in 2022  compared to a loss of ‚Ç¨40.5 million in 2021.The Group's net debt (including Seqens net current accounts) totaled ‚Ç¨228.4 million vs. ‚Ç¨172.7 million as of December 31  2021  as a result of the additional financing from Seqens via the current accounts of the losses and investments of the year.OutlookIn the context of the current dispute with Mithra  PCAS has no option but to consider a temporary reduction of the activity in 2023 at the production site concerned  since some of its workshops are dedicated to the production of Estetrol. At this stage  it is not possible to accurately assess the consequences this dispute may have on future business forecasts and results.Consequently  the return to positive results announced for 2023 is postponed.PCAS Group continues to benefit from the support of its majority shareholder Seqens (76.66%) for the financing of its activities and its development.NEXT FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE:Q1 2023 Net Sales  April 24  2023ABOUT PCASPCAS specializes in the development and production of complex molecules for life sciences and innovative technologies.

PCAS considers that EBITDA is a measurement that is frequently indicated and widely used by investors and other interested parties as a measurement of the operational performance of PCAS and its debt service capacity insofar as it makes it possible to make a constant comparison of performance without taking into account amortization expenses  which may vary significantly depending on the accounting methods used (particularly in the event of acquisitions) or non-operational factors (such as historical cost). Consequently  this information is indicated in the present document to enable a more exhaustive and global analysis of operational performance in comparison with other companies and of PCAS‚Äô debt service capacity.

This upgrade underscores the company‚Äôs operating strength  strong financial structure and financial discipline.In its release  Fitch noted: ‚ÄúThe upgrade reflects the company‚Äôs recent de-leveraging and Fitch‚Äôs confidence that management will continue to meet its conservative net debt/EBITDA target of about 2.5x. The rating reflects JDEP‚Äôs strong market position in the global coffee industry with strong and broadly stable profitability  supported by the sector‚Äôs low price elasticity and the potential for further premiumisation of the company‚Äôs products. This combines with low capex requirements and dividend distributions to allow for consistently high free cash flow  providing good financial flexibility.

(EURONEXT: UMG) announced today that its Board of Directors has extended the engagement of UMG Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sir Lucian Grainge until May 1  2028.UMG""UMG is the world's most successful music company and there are incredible opportunities ahead for a company with the right leadership and vision "" said Sherry Lansing  UMG's Chairman of the Board. ""The UMG Board is resolutely committed to converting those opportunities and maximizing shareholder value for the long term. Only the right kind of chief executive can help achieve that goal and Lucian is just the one to do it. Through his clear vision and strong execution in building UMG into the industry leader  Lucian has also essentially created a new category of music company. This agreement is designed to drive both the sustainable success of UMG and long-term shareholder value.""The extended and amended agreement transitions Grainge from an all-cash compensation package to one that is a combination of equity and cash and includes an equity compensation program with a broad set of performance-based objectives aligned with shareholders' interest and corresponding to the Company's long-term growth strategy.To assure the compensation program is aligned with shareholders' interest  the majority of the compensation package's economic value will be paid in UMG equity and UMG performance-based stock options.Grainge's annual salary under the new agreement will be reduced by more than two-thirds from his current salary‚Äîto $5 million. Subject to the achievement of performance criteria  he will be eligible for an annual bonus with a target of $10 million. The EBITA bonus from his prior employment agreement has been eliminated and Grainge will only be entitled to the contingent bonus under his prior employment agreement on a pro rata basis until March 31  2023.The equity components of the program include annual grants of $20 million  comprised of as much as 50% Performance Share Units (PSUs)‚Äîwith annual PSU goals set by the Board of Directors‚Äîand the remainder comprised of Restricted Share Units (RSUs).

Hosts a Successful Capital Markets Day at its Lithium Laboratory in H√∂chst,"Amsterdam  30 March 2023 --- AMG Advanced Metallurgical Group N.V. (""AMG""  EURONEXT AMSTERDAM: ""AMG"") will start production of lithium hydroxide in Bitterfeld in the fourth quarter of 2023. Dr. Heinz Schimmelbusch  CEO and Chairman of the Management Board  pr‚Ä¶","Amsterdam  30 March 2023 --- AMG Advanced Metallurgical Group N.V. (""AMG""  EURONEXT AMSTERDAM: ""AMG"") will start production of lithium hydroxide in Bitterfeld in the fourth quarter of 2023. Dr. Heinz Schimmelbusch  CEO and Chairman of the Management Board  presented the plans for the refinery today in Frankfurt. As early as 2024  subsidiary AMG Lithium GmbH will produce 20 000 metric tons of lithium hydroxide annually in Bitterfeld-Wolfen ‚Äì enough for batteries for around 500 000 electric vehicles (‚ÄúEVs‚Äù). AMG‚Äôs first module is sold out and by 2030  AMG plans to expand annual production to 100 000 metric tons of lithium hydroxide.Dr. Heinz Schimmelbusch  Chairman of the Management Board and CEO of AMG N.V. said  ‚ÄúWith our production of lithium hydroxide in Germany  we are making an important contribution to electromobility in Europe. And by establishing our own complete lithium value chain  we are supporting the European battery material independence as the electric vehicle industry continues to expand.‚Äù‚ÄúBattery production is currently heavily dominated by Asian countries. We will be ready to supply the European electric vehicle market as it transitions to full electromobility by 2035. In addition to providing lithium  this includes above all our technological know-how to produce the basic material for industrial production in the best and most reliable quality ‚Äù said Dr. Stefan Scherer  CEO of AMG Lithium.From mining to the next generation of lithium products  AMG aims to cover the entire lithium value chain by 2026: from spodumene extraction at its own mine in Brazil  to the production of technical-grade lithium carbonate in Brazil  to the production of battery-grade lithium hydroxide in Germany.To this end  AMG is expanding the refinery at the Bitterfeld site to a total of five modules by 2030  which will produce 100 000 metric tons of lithium hydroxide annually. The current total projected investment volume from extraction to processing and refining of the lithium is ‚Ç¨1 billion. Lithium hydroxide is an important raw material for the production of cathode materials for batteries in EVs and thus for the path to climate-neutral mobility. With the refinery in Bitterfeld  AMG is primarily aiming to supply customers who manufacture in Europe. A contract has already been signed to supply at least 5 000 metric tons of lithium hydroxide annually to the South Korean company EcoPro  which will process it into cathode material in Debrecen  Hungary.On January 31  AMG N.V. announced that its wholly owned subsidiary  AMG Lithium GmbH (‚ÄúAMG Lithium‚Äù)  signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding (‚ÄúMOU‚Äù) with FREYR Battery  a developer of clean  next-generation battery cell production capacity. The basis of the MOU is for AMG Lithium to supply FREYR between 3 000 to 5 000 tons per annum of battery-grade lithium hydroxide. The agreement between AMG Lithium and FREYR further lays out deepening the understanding of the technical requirements and future needs of both parties. In particular  the reduction of the carbon footprint throughout the supply chain is a common goal for both parties.On March 22  AMG N.V. announced its 25 percent stake in Zinnwald Lithium Plc  and the admission of the newly issued ordinary shares took place on March 29. The lithium development company  which has an approved mining license  plans to supply around 12 000 metric tons of lithium hydroxide annually near Dresden in the future to meet the battery needs of EVs in Europe.‚ÄúEstablishing a raw material base close to our Bitterfeld operations has logistical and strategic benefits for AMG ‚Äù commented Dr. Heinz Schimmelbusch. ‚ÄúThe site in the heart of the European chemical and automotive industry is well on its way to becoming the lithium hydroxide hotspot for batteries in Europe.‚ÄùAbout AMGAMG's mission is to provide critical materials and related process technologies to advance a less carbon-intensive world. To this end  AMG is focused on the production and development of energy storage materials such as lithium  vanadium  and tantalum.

(NASDAQ: FSLR) and EDP Renewables (Euronext: EDPR) today announced a multi-year order for 1.8 gigawatts (GWdc) of First Solar‚Äôs advanced thin film photovoltaic (PV) solar modules. The modules  which will be delivered up to 2028  will power US projects developed by EDP Renewables North America (EDPR NA).EDP Renewables is a leading global pure renewable energy company that operates in 28 markets around the globe. North America is the company‚Äôs biggest market in terms of installed capacity and production  where the company currently operates 475 MW of solar projects  has 1.6 GW of solar capacity under construction  and has a robust solar development pipeline across the continent. In addition  EDPR operates more than 200 distributed generation solar sites throughout North America. Including both utility-scale and distributed generation  EDPR plans to add 4.8 gigawatts (GW) of solar capacity in North America in 2023-2026.‚ÄúEDP Renewables‚Äô ambitious business plan calls for more than 4 GW of renewable capacity annually through 2026 with nearly half of the new clean energy generation to come from North America ‚Äù said Sandhya Ganapathy  chief executive officer  EDPR NA. ‚ÄúSolar is an increasingly important technology in our portfolio  and we are well-positioned to work with innovative and environmentally responsible partners and products that can help us meet our outlined targets and lead the energy transition.‚ÄùFirst Solar‚Äôs responsibly produced advanced thin film PV modules set industry benchmarks for quality  durability  reliability  design  and environmental performance. It is the only one of the world‚Äôs ten largest solar manufacturers to be a member of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA)  the world‚Äôs largest industry coalition dedicated to supporting the rights and well-being of workers and communities in the global supply chain  and the company has zero tolerance for forced labor in its manufacturing or its supply chains. First Solar‚Äôs modules have the lowest carbon and water footprint of any commercially available PV module today and the company is the first PV manufacturer to have its product included in the Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT) global registry for sustainable electronics.‚ÄúWe welcome EDP Renewables‚Äô decision to power its projects with our technology and look forward to supporting its growth in the US and  potentially  beyond ‚Äù said Mark Widmar  chief executive officer  First Solar. ‚ÄúEDP Renewables joins a growing roster of large  sophisticated developers choosing long-term pricing and supply certainty  and responsibly produced solar modules by powering their projects with First Solar‚Äôs technology. This validates the value that our customers place in our differentiation  not just in technology but our way of doing business.‚ÄùWith this strategic agreement  EDPR de-risks its solar pipeline in the US by securing equipment for its expected growth in the utility and distributed generation segments. Additionally  this allows EDPR to increase its commitment to local content in the US  while also pursuing its strategy of supply chain and technology diversification. The partnership between both companies started in 2019  when EDPR acquired a 50% stake in a 278 MW solar portfolio developed by First Solar.First Solar is expanding its US manufacturing footprint  which currently stands at more than 5 GW of annual nameplate capacity with three operating factories in Ohio. The company is expected to reach more than 10 GW by 2025  when it completes its new $1.1 billion factory in Alabama and a $185 million expansion of its existing capacity in Ohio. First Solar is also investing $270 million in a new research and development innovation center in Ohio. Additionally  First Solar is expected to commission its first factory in India in the second half of 2023  adding 3.4 GW of new nameplate annual capacity. The company expects to have more than 20 GW of annual global nameplate manufacturing capacity by 2025.About EDP RenewablesEDP Renewables North America LLC (EDPR NA)  its affiliates  and its subsidiaries develop  construct  own  and operate wind farms and solar parks throughout North America.

(NASDAQ: FSLR) and EDP Renewables (Euronext: EDPR) today announced a multi-year order for 1.8 gigawatts (GWdc) of First Solar‚Äôs advanced thin film photovoltaic (PV) solar modules. The modules  which will be delivered up to 2028  will power US projects developed by EDP Renewables North America (EDPR NA).EDP Renewables is a leading global pure renewable energy company that operates in 28 markets around the globe. North America is the company‚Äôs biggest market in terms of installed capacity and production  where the company currently operates 475 MW of solar projects  has 1.6 GW of solar capacity under construction  and has a robust solar development pipeline across the continent. In addition  EDPR operates more than 200 distributed generation solar sites throughout North America. Including both utility-scale and distributed generation  EDPR plans to add 4.8 gigawatts (GW) of solar capacity in North America in 2023-2026.‚ÄúEDP Renewables‚Äô ambitious business plan calls for more than 4 GW of renewable capacity annually through 2026 with nearly half of the new clean energy generation to come from North America ‚Äù said Sandhya Ganapathy  chief executive officer  EDPR NA. ‚ÄúSolar is an increasingly important technology in our portfolio  and we are well-positioned to work with innovative and environmentally responsible partners and products that can help us meet our outlined targets and lead the energy transition.‚ÄùFirst Solar‚Äôs responsibly produced advanced thin film PV modules set industry benchmarks for quality  durability  reliability  design  and environmental performance. It is the only one of the world‚Äôs ten largest solar manufacturers to be a member of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA)  the world‚Äôs largest industry coalition dedicated to supporting the rights and well-being of workers and communities in the global supply chain  and the company has zero tolerance for forced labor in its manufacturing or its supply chains. First Solar‚Äôs modules have the lowest carbon and water footprint of any commercially available PV module today and the company is the first PV manufacturer to have its product included in the Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT) global registry for sustainable electronics.‚ÄúWe welcome EDP Renewables‚Äô decision to power its projects with our technology and look forward to supporting its growth in the US and  potentially  beyond ‚Äù said Mark Widmar  chief executive officer  First Solar. ‚ÄúEDP Renewables joins a growing roster of large  sophisticated developers choosing long-term pricing and supply certainty  and responsibly produced solar modules by powering their projects with First Solar‚Äôs technology. This validates the value that our customers place in our differentiation  not just in technology but our way of doing business.‚ÄùWith this strategic agreement  EDPR de-risks its solar pipeline in the US by securing equipment for its expected growth in the utility and distributed generation segments. Additionally  this allows EDPR to increase its commitment to local content in the US  while also pursuing its strategy of supply chain and technology diversification. The partnership between both companies started in 2019  when EDPR acquired a 50% stake in a 278 MW solar portfolio developed by First Solar.First Solar is expanding its US manufacturing footprint  which currently stands at more than 5 GW of annual nameplate capacity with three operating factories in Ohio. The company is expected to reach more than 10 GW by 2025  when it completes its new $1.1 billion factory in Alabama and a $185 million expansion of its existing capacity in Ohio. First Solar is also investing $270 million in a new research and development innovation center in Ohio. Additionally  First Solar is expected to commission its first factory in India in the second half of 2023  adding 3.4 GW of new nameplate annual capacity.

(EURONEXT: UMG) announced today that its Board of Directors has extended the engagement of UMG Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sir Lucian Grainge until May 1  2028.""UMG is the world's most successful music company and there are incredible opportunities ahead for a company with the right leadership and vision "" said Sherry Lansing  UMG's Chairman of the Board. ""The UMG Board is resolutely committed to converting those opportunities and maximizing shareholder value for the long term. Only the right kind of chief executive can help achieve that goal and Lucian is just the one to do it. Through his clear vision and strong execution in building UMG into the industry leader  Lucian has also essentially created a new category of music company. This agreement is designed to drive both the sustainable success of UMG and long-term shareholder value.""The extended and amended agreement transitions Grainge from an all-cash compensation package to one that is a combination of equity and cash and includes an equity compensation program with a broad set of performance-based objectives aligned with shareholders' interest and corresponding to the Company's long-term growth strategy.To assure the compensation program is aligned with shareholders' interest  the majority of the compensation package's economic value will be paid in UMG equity and UMG performance-based stock options.Grainge's annual salary under the new agreement will be reduced by more than two-thirds from his current salary‚Äîto $5 million. Subject to the achievement of performance criteria  he will be eligible for an annual bonus with a target of $10 million. The EBITA bonus from his prior employment agreement has been eliminated and Grainge will only be entitled to the contingent bonus under his prior employment agreement on a pro rata basis until March 31  2023.The equity components of the program include annual grants of $20 million  comprised of as much as 50% Performance Share Units (PSUs)‚Äîwith annual PSU goals set by the Board of Directors‚Äîand the remainder comprised of Restricted Share Units (RSUs). As part of the Long-Term Incentive Plan  Grainge will receive a one-time transition equity award of $100 million  of which 50% will be in the form of RSUs and 50% in the form of Performance Stock Options (PSOs). The PSOs will only be paid out if the Company surpasses stock price hurdles (1/3rd at ‚Ç¨26.50  another 1/3rd at ‚Ç¨30.00 and 1/3rd at ‚Ç¨38.00) within the term of the agreement ending May 1  2028.The size of the potential equity grant falls within the parameters for potential equity grants as previously disclosed and voted on by shareholders at UMG's 2022 Annual General Meeting in the Company's 2022 Global Equity Plan and UMG's Executive Directors Remuneration Policy.To align Grainge's term as executive director and Chairman and CEO of UMG with the term of the extended employment agreement‚Äîending on May 1  2028‚Äîthe Board will put to UMG's General Meeting a proposal to reappoint Grainge as executive director for a term ending on May 1  2028. For further information on this proposal (and the proposal below)  please see the Investor Relations section of the UMG website (https://investors.universalmusic.com/).The Board will also seek approval at UMG's 2023 Annual General Meeting for a supplement to UMG's existing Executive Directors Remuneration Policy with respect to Grainge's new remuneration.Further discussion of UMG's compensation programs and their use of equity- and performance-based compensation‚Äîincluding the Global Equity Plan approved by shareholders in 2022‚Äîis posted in the Investor Relations section of the UMG website (https://investors.universalmusic.com/) and included in the Remuneration Report of the Company's Annual Report to Shareholders.About Universal Music GroupAt Universal Music Group (EURONEXT: UMG)  we exist to shape culture through the power of artistry.

During the synthesis of isododecane  some of the molecules combine not in threes but in fours. The result is isohexadecane  a sixteen-carbon molecule that is also widely used in cosmetics.To bring value to this isododecane co-product  Global Bioenergies developed a purification process for the molecule  defined the technical specifications  commissioned toxicological studies from a recognised company in the field and obtained registration of the molecule under the REACh European regulatory system.The Company has now produced the first volumes of the new ingredient and starts offering them to its future customers  namely brand owners  manufacturers and distributors. It now begins to market this new naturally sourced ingredient according to ISO 16128  produced exclusively in France under the trade name ‚ÄúIsonaturane¬Æ 16‚Äù.Daphne Galvez  Global Bioenergies Commercial Director  said: ‚ÄúIsododecane is used in a wide range of product categories and is particularly known for being the key ingredient for all longwear  waterproof and transfer-free make-up. Isohexadecane is mainly used in skincare  where its texturing properties are similar to those of silicones. Isohexadecane can be a good substitute for them  helping to improve the environmental profile of finished products.‚ÄùMarc Delcourt  co-founder and CEO of Global Bioenergies  explained: ‚ÄúIn terms of volume  isobutene accounts for roughly 5% of all cosmetic inputs. At least nine cosmetic ingredients are derived from it. By far the two biggest by volume are isododecane and isohexadecane  which is why we wanted to go down the value chain in order to produce and sell the actual ingredients for both molecules. Our priority today is to continue our efforts to scale up our bio-sourced isobutene production process to make it available at a decreasing cost for cosmetics applications  but also in other industrial sectors seeking as well to reduce their carbon footprint.‚ÄùAbout GLOBAL BIOENERGIESGlobal Bioenergies converts plant-derived resources into compounds used in the cosmetics industry  as well as the energy and materials sectors. After launching the first long-lasting and natural make-up brand LAST¬Æ in 2021  Global Bioenergies is now marketing Isonaturane¬Æ 12  its key ingredient  to major cosmetics companies to improve the naturalness of their formulas whilst improving their carbon footprint. In the long run  Global Bioenergies is also aiming at cutting CO 2 emissions in the aviation and road sector and thereby curb global warming.

During the synthesis of isododecane  some of the molecules combine not in threes but in fours. The result is isohexadecane  a sixteen-carbon molecule that is also widely used in cosmetics.To bring value to this isododecane co-product  Global Bioenergies developed a purification process for the molecule  defined the technical specifications  commissioned toxicological studies from a recognised company in the field and obtained registration of the molecule under the REACh European regulatory system.The Company has now produced the first volumes of the new ingredient and starts offering them to its future customers  namely brand owners  manufacturers and distributors. It now begins to market this new naturally sourced ingredient according to ISO 16128  produced exclusively in France under the trade name ‚ÄúIsonaturane¬Æ 16‚Äù.Daphne Galvez  Global Bioenergies Commercial Director  said: ‚ÄúIsododecane is used in a wide range of product categories and is particularly known for being the key ingredient for all longwear  waterproof and transfer-free make-up. Isohexadecane is mainly used in skincare  where its texturing properties are similar to those of silicones. Isohexadecane can be a good substitute for them  helping to improve the environmental profile of finished products.‚ÄùMarc Delcourt  co-founder and CEO of Global Bioenergies  explained: ‚ÄúIn terms of volume  isobutene accounts for roughly 5% of all cosmetic inputs. At least nine cosmetic ingredients are derived from it. By far the two biggest by volume are isododecane and isohexadecane  which is why we wanted to go down the value chain in order to produce and sell the actual ingredients for both molecules. Our priority today is to continue our efforts to scale up our bio-sourced isobutene production process to make it available at a decreasing cost for cosmetics applications  but also in other industrial sectors seeking as well to reduce their carbon footprint.‚ÄùAbout GLOBAL BIOENERGIESGlobal Bioenergies converts plant-derived resources into compounds used in the cosmetics industry  as well as the energy and materials sectors. After launching the first long-lasting and natural make-up brand LAST¬Æ in 2021  Global Bioenergies is now marketing Isonaturane¬Æ 12  its key ingredient  to major cosmetics companies to improve the naturalness of their formulas whilst improving their carbon footprint. In the long run  Global Bioenergies is also aiming at cutting CO 2 emissions in the aviation and road sector and thereby curb global warming.

The team is being strengthened by the addition of a new full-time geologist  a US citizen who will be permanently based in Mineral County.First drilling will be on the OMCO Mine prospect at the Olympic Gold project  to follow up the 2022 discovery of an extension to the previously mined OMCO vein  expected to commence in April when weather and ground conditions permit.MILL CONSTRUCTIONIt is now several weeks since groundwork was completed at the site of the Company's 50%-owned milling joint venture in Mina  Nevada and the next stage is currently waiting on suitable weather conditions for pouring concrete  due to a recurrence of severe weather conditions this month.As previously announced  all permit applications have been filed with the authorities and approval is awaited  timing of which is outside the Company's control. Virtually all equipment needed for the assembly of the plant is now available and there are unlikely to be significant delays in the overall programme as a consequence of the extended winter.REVIEW OF M2 COPPER POTENTIALAs previously announced  the Company has been conducting an extensive review of its copper prospects during the winter  including the area known as M2 located in the Black Mountains group of claims.At M2  a JORC-compliant independent report in 2018 established a copper resource  partly inferred/partly indicated  of 4.28 million tonnes at a grade of 0.45% Cu1. This is a large resource at a significant grade but falls short of the tonnage required for commercial development.Included in the 2018 JORC-compliant independent resource report were the following two statements:(1) The deposit contains a central area  300 meters in length  which has only been tested by two drillholes. This area is given a high probability of containing additional resources. At a finding rate of 3 505 tonnes per meter we assume a probably target of 1 to 3 million tonnes  grading 0.4 to 0.6 percent total copper.1 1.53 Mt at 0.45% Cu Indicated  2.75 Mt at 0.44% Cu Inferred at 0.2% cut off.(2) The area of M2 IP anomaly comprises 163 hectares. Deducting the drilled area  which comprises 33 hectares  the target area consists of 130 hectares. Assuming a 65% probability of success  this target would consist of 9 to 14 million tonnes grading 0.4 to 0.6 percent total copper.As the areas referred to in (1) and (2) above have not yet been drilled  they are categorised as Exploration Targets in JORC terminology and cannot be categorised as Resources. The recent review of all available data  taking into account the independent report on M2  has re-emphasised the exciting potential for M2 which could far exceed the Resource already reported.If these independently calculated Exploration Targets prove to be correct  the Resource and the Exploration Targets together at M2 could become 14.3 - 21.3 million tonnes at 0.4 - 0.6 % copper  being several times larger than the existing Resource. Such an increase would be transformative for Great Western  but in addition it should be noted that the 1.5 km strike-length copper Resource atM2 lies within a 6.5 km belt of along-strike potential which is all within the Company's claims  open to the northeast and southwest as well as down-dip to the southeast. The strongest IP anomaly  as yet undrilled  is located to the southwest of the existing Resource under tertiary lavas. To the northeast  where tertiary lavas do not obscure the host sequences  surface showings of copper occur for a further 1.5 km on Great Western's claims.Please visit the Black Mountain page on the Company website using the link below to view images showing (1) the M2 prospect within the Black Mountains group and (2) an overview of the regional setting of Great Western's claims within an extensively mined area:https://www.greatwesternmining.com/projects/black-mountain-group/ANALYST VISITGreat Western is hosting investment analysts in Mineral County  Nevada this week who are visiting the Company's claims and reviewing progress at the mill site.CONFERENCE PRESENTATIONGreat Western Executive Chairman Brian Hall will be presenting at the 2023 Global Mining Finance Spring Conference on Thursday 20th April 2023. This is taking place at The Armourers' Hall  81 Coleman St  London EC2R 5BJ and will begin at 9.30 a.m. BST. Complimentary delegate passes can be obtained using the following link:http://www.global-mining-finance.com/Brian Hall  Executive Chairman commented: ""In-depth work over recent months has made our copper potential look ever more interesting and we are actively seeking a development partner for M2. Once we have completed our studies of the Huntoon Valley and the Eastside Mine copper prospects  we will report on these as well. Great Western's near  medium and longer term objectives remain (1) completing the mill facility and bringing it on to production (2) continuing the search for precious metals and pinning down a discovery for development and (3) ensuring that the potential upside of the Company's copper prospects is maximised. Importantly  once the mill is producing we will become a revenue and cash generating business and we look forward to keeping shareholders informed on progress.""Qualified Person Statement: The information in this announcement that relates to exploration results is based on information reviewed by Dr James Blight MGeol PhD MAusIMM who is ExplorationManager of Great Western Mining PLC.

The area consists of rugged  mountainous terrain  which means that large parts of it remain under-explored. Mineral potential is hosted by the regional Walker Lane Structural Belt  the largest structural and metallogenic belt in Nevada  yet one of the least explored in recent times  with gold  silver and copper currently produced in Mineral County. Great Western has seven distinct concession areas which offer the potential for exploiting (1) short term gold and silver deposits and (2) long-term  world-class copper deposits.Six of the Company's properties are in the west of Mineral County and are 100% owned and operated. The Company has an option to acquire a seventh property  the Olympic Gold Project  in the east of the county. Great Western's small exploration team is supported by locally based consultants and contractors.The state of Nevada is generally considered to be one of the world's most mining friendly jurisdictions. While tightly regulated and environmentally conscious  Nevada welcomes the mining industry. Great Western takes care to ensure that its claims are maintained in good standing and all regulations observed.There are numerous gold and silver prospects on the Company's acreage  including extensive historic mine workings which offer the opportunity for secondary recovery. The Company is party to a 50-50 joint venture known as Western Milling LLC which is constructing a mill to process pre-mined material for secondary recovery of gold and silver.Furthermore  through extensive drilling over a five-year period  GWM has established a Mineral Resource on its first target area known as M2  of 4.3 million tonnes at 0.45% copper  for 19 000 tonnes of contained copper metal. This resource has been independently reported in accordance with JORC guidelines.GWM has established an Inferred Resource Estimate of 31 000 tonnes grading 1.6 g/t gold and 3.0 g/t silver in tailings for the OMCO Mine at the Olympic Gold Project. It has also established Exploration targets. In addition  the Company has reported an Exploration Target as follows:‚Ä¢ 3 400 - 6 400 tonnes grading between 0.5 and 1.2 g/t Au and 1.2 and 2.1 g/t Ag in the substrate beneath the tailings volume at the Olympic Mine.‚Ä¢ 9 000 - 12 000 tonnes grading between 0.9 and 2.4 g/t Au and 2.0 and 5.1 g/t Ag in a coarse stockpile at Olympic Mine.",positive,0.86,0.13,0.01,mixed,0.44,0.12,0.44,True,English,"['Great Western Mining', 'Operational Update', 'Great Western Executive Chairman Brian Hall', '2023 Global Mining Finance Spring Conference', 'Great Western Mining Corporation PLC', '50%-owned milling joint venture', '0.4 to 0.6 percent total copper', '2018 JORC-compliant independent resource report', '1.5 km strike-length copper Resource', ""The Armourers' Hall"", 'JORC-compliant independent report', 'new full-time geologist', 'Black Mountains group', 'strongest IP anomaly', 'Black Mountain page', 'London EC2R 5BJ', 'Complimentary delegate passes', '1 to 3 million tonnes', '9 to 14 million tonnes', 'following two statements', 'OMCO Mine prospect', 'Olympic Gold project', 'suitable weather conditions', 'severe weather conditions', 'Thursday 20th April', 'MILL CONSTRUCTION STATUS', 'following operational update', '14.3 - 21.3 million tonnes', 'M2 IP anomaly', 'M2 COPPER POTENTIAL', '4.28 million tonnes', '0.4 - 0.6 % copper', 'CONFERENCE PRESENTATION', 'ground conditions', 'copper targets', 'copper prospects', 'OMCO vein', 'two drillholes', '6.5 km belt', 'large resource', 'exciting potential', 'existing Resource', 'strike potential', 'following link', 'M2 prospect', 'Euronext Growth', '2023 WORK SEASON', 'FIRST DRILLING', 'INVESTMENT ANALYSTS', 'Mineral County', 'drilling operations', '2023 exploration programme', 'US citizen', 'next stage', 'permit applications', 'significant delays', 'overall programme', 'commercial development', 'finding rate', 'Exploration Targets', 'JORC terminology', 'available data', 'tertiary lavas', 'host sequences', 'surface showings', 'regional setting', 'ANALYST VISIT', '81 Coleman St', 'mill site', 'extensive review', 'recent review', 'extended winter', 'significant grade', 'high probability', 'additional resources', 'central area', 'Company website', 'target area', '3,505 tonnes', '65% probability', 'GWM', 'AIM', '8GW', 'silver', 'Nevada', 'PLANS', 'WEEK', 'team', 'start', '2022 discovery', 'extension', 'groundwork', 'Mina', 'concrete', 'recurrence', 'authorities', 'approval', 'timing', 'control', 'equipment', 'assembly', 'plant', 'consequence', '0.45% Cu', 'tonnage', 'deposit', 'meters', '1 1.53 Mt', '2.75 Mt', '0.44% Cu', '163 hectares', '33 hectares', '130 hectares', 'success', 'areas', 'account', 'increase', 'northeast', 'southwest', 'southeast', 'images', 'overview', 'black-mountain-group', 'progress', 'place', '9.30 a']",2023-03-30,2023-03-31,marketscreener.com

He would do so with great humility  intelligence and the capacity to look to the future that were such a part of him: his most precious bequest.Iginio Liberali was a man of exceptional professional and human qualities. He built the foundations for the success and growth of the LU-VE Group  which since 1986 has multiplied its turnover sixty times over and increased the Group's collaborators from under 200 to the over 4 000 that are currently working for us.This document is dedicated to Iginio Liberali.In 2022  the LU-VE Group achieved a series of exceptional results.We posted the highest turnover ever  exceeding ‚Ç¨ 618 million (+25.7% compared to 2021).Last September  we were admitted onto the Euronext STAR segment of the Milan Stock Exchange  culminating a process that began with the listing on the AIM market (2015) and continued with the transition to the main MTA market (2017).During what are hard times  featuring high inÔ¨Çation and the rise in the cost of living  we have stood beside our collabora-tors  by putting up ‚Ç¨ 3 million. We have wanted to give them and their families true support  a sign acknowledging the women and men without whom it would not have been possible to become what we are today.The year 2022 was also a year that introduced a range of changes in terms of governance and sustainability strategy.To address the new challenges  we have set up the Sustainability Steering Committee  that will see the regular partici-pation of the CEO  COO  CFO  Investor Relations and Sustainability OfÔ¨Åcer. This is where the strategic lines will be plotted and the progress of our performance will be evaluated  with the involvement of other directors and Group managers with expertise on the speciÔ¨Åc issues covered by sustainability.For the Ô¨Årst time the LU-VE group has prepared the 2023-2025 Sustainability Plan  which was approved by the Board of Directors in February 2023.In line with our strategic priorities to contribute to sustainable development  we have outlined athree-year plan of action based on four macro-objectives: climate neutrality  positive impact products  high engage-ment of collaborators and the integration of sustainability in our industrial plan.Climate changes are generating and will continue to generate  at a global level  increasingly negative effects on the economy  the environment and the lives of every one of us (increased poverty  migrations  water and food scarcity  reduction of biodi-versity).What's more  the current context sees two trends coming to the fore: the increasing demand for air conditioning and refrigeration and the concomitant need to reduce energy consumption and climate-altering emissions.The LU -VE Group has responded by promoting advanced technological solutions with reduced environmental impact. We can contribute to reducing (direct and indirect) greenhouse gases  by Ô¨Ånding ways to mitigate our environmental impacts and build increasingly effective products that are compatible with the environment in terms of energy consumption  optimised performance and the use of natural refrigeration Ô¨Çuids.Ever since its foundation the LU-VE Group has paid attention to ESG issues that have now taken centre stage. For some time now we have been preparing ourselves to respond to the new challenges posed by sustainability in general  by climate change  by our desire to be close to our stakeholders and shareholders and the need to equip ourselves with new systems of governance  while also involving our customers and suppliers in this process. We know that it is essential to Ô¨Ånd new ways to promote sustainability at a global level: this is our challenge as market leaders.",neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,mixed,0.68,0.04,0.28,True,English,"['LU VE S', 'ESG Report', 'The LU -VE Group', 'Euronext STAR segment', 'Milan Stock Exchange', 'advanced technological solutions', 'indirect) greenhouse gases', 'high inÔ¨Çation', 'speciÔ¨Åc issues', 'positive impact products', 'reduced environmental impact', 'main MTA market', 'LEADERSHIP WITH PASSION', 'natural refrigeration Ô¨Çuids', 'Sustainability Steering Committee', 'Sustainability OfÔ¨Åcer', '2023-2025 Sustainability Plan', 'chairman Iginio Liberali', 'high engage-ment', 'environmental impacts', 'effective products', 'ESG issues', 'AIM market', 'three-year plan', 'industrial plan', 'market leaders', 'LU-VE Group', 'Group managers', 'many things', 'work way', 'best days', 'Nazim Hikmet', 'considerable amount', 'sustainable development', 'precious bequest', 'exceptional professional', 'human qualities', 'exceptional results', 'hard times', 'true support', 'new challenges', 'regular partici-pation', 'Investor Relations', 'strategic lines', 'strategic priorities', 'four macro-objectives', 'climate neutrality', 'global level', 'negative effects', 'food scarcity', 'current context', 'two trends', 'increasing demand', 'air conditioning', 'energy consumption', 'climate-altering emissions', 'centre stage', 'climate change', 'new systems', 'Ô¨Årst time', 'professional life', 'great humility', 'highest turnover', 'other directors', 'concomitant need', 'new ways', 'sustainability strategy', 'last year', 'changes', 'GARDENER', 'DREAMS', 'founder', 'December', 'values', 'personal', 'future', 'emotion', 'letter', 'task', 'intelligence', 'capacity', 'foundations', 'success', 'growth', 'collaborators', 'document', 'series', 'process', 'listing', 'transition', 'rise', 'cost', 'living', 'collabora-tors', 'families', 'sign', 'women', 'range', 'terms', 'governance', 'CEO', 'COO', 'CFO', 'progress', 'performance', 'involvement', 'expertise', 'Board', 'February', 'action', 'integration', 'economy', 'lives', 'poverty', 'migrations', 'water', 'reduction', 'biodi-versity', 'fore', 'attention', 'desire', 'stakeholders', 'shareholders', 'customers', 'suppliers']",2023-03-30,2023-03-31,marketscreener.com

Digital collections from streaming services are the fastest growing source of publishing income and are expected to represent the majority of publishing revenue in the future. From a geographic standpoint  there is a true alignment between the largest publishing markets (Europe  followed by the United States and then fast-developing Asian markets) and where Believe is best positioned and able to bring high-value services to its clients.In this context  the acquisition of Sentric acts as a first step for Believe in rolling out a global and comprehensive publishing business.

TuneCore publishing administration has paid over $100 million to songwriters who utilize the service.Moving forward  Sentric‚Äôs integration will further strengthen publishing for TuneCore‚Äôs self-releasing artists and expand it to new geographies. Sentric will then offer publishing services to all clients within the Believe Group  who will be able to monetize their music seamlessly. The acquisition will also provide new ways to manage and optimize catalogs and address songwriters and publishers  in addition to artists and labels.Denis Ladegaillerie  Founder & CEO  Believe  said  ‚ÄúThe acquisition of Sentric is the first step for Believe in the roll-out of a global and comprehensive publishing offer. The growth and digital transformation of the songwriters‚Äô market is opening-up many opportunities. We are excited to be able to immediately expand the services we provide to our existing TuneCore clients with Sentric‚Äôs best-in-class royalty collection service  while starting to work on future innovative products and services for all of Believe‚Äôs songwriters and publishers.‚ÄùBelieve is acquiring full ownership of Sentric  which was held by Utopia since February 2022.

The growth in net sales was mainly driven by Estetrol's sales for Mithra  strong demand for Turku's products  a favorable EUR/USD exchange rate  and the impact of price increase initiatives launched in recent months to cope with the sharp rise in the cost of raw materials and energy.It should be noted that  due to some overdue receivables observed since the summer 2022 and which have remained since then  PCAS decided to take appropriate legal action against its customer Mithra at the end of 2022 in order to collect these unpaid receivables. The total amount of receivables due by this customer amounted to ‚Ç¨31.1 million at December 31  2022 (including ‚Ç¨13.6 million of overdue receivables).Net sales of Fine Specialty Chemicals totaled ‚Ç¨82.7 million  a 22.7% increase compared to 2021 (+18.6% at constant exchange rates). Business was very strong throughout the year with very strong demand for Electronics and Cosmetics  as well as a positive trend in Lubricants and Fine Chemicals. The increase in raw material and energy costs could be passed through to customers and thus contributed to the growth in net sales. The industrialization of new products also benefitted from a very good momentum.EBITDA of the PCAS Group totaled 2.2 million euros in 2022 against -4.6 million euros in 2021.Current operating income amounted to -‚Ç¨27.7 million in 2022  compared to -28.2 million euros in 2021.These results continue to show substantial losses  still negatively affected by a level of activity which is still not sufficient to cover the fixed costs incurred at several Pharmaceutical Synthesis sites  and the inventory depreciations linked to non-compliant products.Other operating income and expenses include an impairment of goodwill of ‚Ç¨14.5 million  already recognized in the half-yearly financial statements at June 30  2022.The financial result showed a loss of ‚Ç¨3.1 million in 2022  against -‚Ç¨2.9 million in 2021.Note that in 2021 the tax expense included an expense of ‚Ç¨6.3 million due to the cancellation of deferred tax assets on tax loss carryforwards  following a lower profit forecast for the years to come for the Group's French entities.The PCAS Group's net income was a loss of ‚Ç¨48.8 million in 2022  compared to a loss of ‚Ç¨40.5 million in 2021.The Group's net debt (including Seqens net current accounts) totaled ‚Ç¨228.4 million vs. ‚Ç¨172.7 million as of December 31  2021  as a result of the additional financing from Seqens via the current accounts of the losses and investments of the year.OutlookIn the context of the current dispute with Mithra  PCAS has no option but to consider a temporary reduction of the activity in 2023 at the production site concerned  since some of its workshops are dedicated to the production of Estetrol. At this stage  it is not possible to accurately assess the consequences this dispute may have on future business forecasts and results.Consequently  the return to positive results announced for 2023 is postponed.PCAS Group continues to benefit from the support of its majority shareholder Seqens (76.66%) for the financing of its activities and its development.NEXT FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE:Q1 2023 Net Sales  April 24  2023ABOUT PCASPCAS specializes in the development and production of complex molecules for life sciences and innovative technologies. With about 11% of its net sales earmarked for R&D and a large international footprint  PCAS is the preferred industrial partner for market-leading major global groups. Boasting especially high standards  the company offers a growing range of proprietary products and solutions in leading-edge segments. PCAS generated net sales of ‚Ç¨226.4 million in 2022 and employs nearly 1200 people in six countries.To find out more about PCAS: www.pcas.comPCAS NewCapJean-Louis Martin / Eric MoissenotEmmanuel Huynh / Louis-Victor Delouvrier NewCapFinancial communication and investor relation Tel.: +33 1 69 79 60 00www.pcas.com Tel.: +33 1 44 71 98 53pcas@newcap.euAPPENDIXDefinition of EBITDA and reconciliation of EBITDA with Current Operating IncomeDefinition of EBITDADefined as the current operating income plus amortization of tangible and intangible assets and net variations in provisions (including net allocations to provisions for inventories  excluding reversal of provisions on destroyed inventories recorded in consumed purchases and net provisions for employee benefits recorded in personal costs) and depreciation of goodwill.EBITDA is not a measurement of performance defined by IFRS standards and should not be considered to be an alternative to operating profit from ordinary activities or net profits (as calculated in accordance with IFRS standards) to measure the operational performance of PCAS  to cash flow resulting from current operations  generated by investments or resulting from financial operations (as calculated in accordance with IFRS standards) to measure the capacity of PCAS to meet its cash flow requirements or to any other performance measurement defined by IFRS standards. PCAS considers that EBITDA is a measurement that is frequently indicated and widely used by investors and other interested parties as a measurement of the operational performance of PCAS and its debt service capacity insofar as it makes it possible to make a constant comparison of performance without taking into account amortization expenses  which may vary significantly depending on the accounting methods used (particularly in the event of acquisitions) or non-operational factors (such as historical cost). Consequently  this information is indicated in the present document to enable a more exhaustive and global analysis of operational performance in comparison with other companies and of PCAS' debt service capacity. Insofar as not all companies calculate the EBITDA in the same way  the presentation of EBITDA in the present document may not be comparable to the EBITDA communicated by other companies.Reconciliation of EBITDA with Current Operating Income,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.26,0.18,0.56,True,English,"['2022 annual results', 'PCAS', 'several Pharmaceutical Synthesis sites', 'market-leading major global groups', 'favorable EUR/USD exchange rate', 'The Pharmaceutical Synthesis business', 'Current operating income margin', 'Seqens net current accounts', 'constant exchange rate', 'appropriate legal action', 'lower profit forecast', 'large international footprint', 'preferred industrial partner', 'Other operating income', 'research tax credit', 'deferred tax assets', 'future business forecasts', 'half-yearly financial statements', 'NEXT FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE', 'Louis-Victor Delouvrier NewCap', 'Fine Specialty Chemicals', 'price increase initiatives', 'tax loss carryforwards', 'previous financial year', 'The PCAS Group', 'The Group', 'net income', 'Fine Chemicals', 'current dispute', 'Financial communication', '2.2 EBITDA margin', 'Financial result', 'tax expense', 'net debt', 'PCAS NewCap', 'Euronext Paris', 'complex molecules', 'life sciences', 'innovative technologies', 'Directors meeting', 'Audit procedures', 'same period', 'strong demand', 'recent months', 'sharp rise', 'raw materials', 'total amount', 'positive trend', 'good momentum', 'fixed costs', 'inventory depreciations', 'French entities', 'temporary reduction', 'majority shareholder', 'R&D', 'high standards', 'growing range', 'leading-edge segments', 'six countries', 'Jean-Louis Martin', 'Eric Moissenot', 'Emmanuel Huynh', 'investor relation', 'Net sales', 'Net result', 'overdue receivables', 'unpaid receivables', 'new products', 'compliant products', 'proprietary products', 'ABOUT PCAS', '2022 ANNUAL RESULTS', 'positive results', 'energy costs', 'substantial losses', 'additional financing', '4.6 million euros', 'production site', 'customer Mithra', '21.1% increase', '20.1% increase', '22.7% increase', '4 EBITDA', 'Ecully', 'March', 'specialist', 'publication', 'today', 'Board', 'millions', 'expenses', 'Taxes', 'CIR', '4.1 M', 'definition', 'appendix', 'auditor', 'report', 'progress', 'December', 'growth', 'Estetrol', 'Turku', 'impact', 'summer', 'order', 'Electronics', 'Cosmetics', 'Lubricants', 'customers', 'industrialization', 'level', 'activity', 'non', 'impairment', 'goodwill', 'June', 'cancellation', 'years', 'investments', 'Outlook', 'context', 'option', 'workshops', 'stage', 'consequences', 'return', 'support', 'activities', 'development', 'Q1', 'April', 'company', 'solutions', '1200 people', 'Tel', '33']",2023-03-05,2023-03-31,finanznachrichten.de

(EURONEXT: UMG) announced today that its Board of Directors has extended the engagement of UMG Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Sir Lucian Grainge until May 1  2028.""UMG is the world's most successful music company and there are incredible opportunities ahead for a company with the right leadership and vision "" said Sherry Lansing  UMG's Chairman of the Board. ""The UMG Board is resolutely committed to converting those opportunities and maximizing shareholder value for the long term. Only the right kind of chief executive can help achieve that goal and Lucian is just the one to do it. Through his clear vision and strong execution in building UMG into the industry leader  Lucian has also essentially created a new category of music company. This agreement is designed to drive both the sustainable success of UMG and long-term shareholder value.""The extended and amended agreement transitions Grainge from an all-cash compensation package to one that is a combination of equity and cash and includes an equity compensation program with a broad set of performance-based objectives aligned with shareholders' interest and corresponding to the Company's long-term growth strategy.To assure the compensation program is aligned with shareholders' interest  the majority of the compensation package's economic value will be paid in UMG equity and UMG performance-based stock options.Grainge's annual salary under the new agreement will be reduced by more than two-thirds from his current salary‚Äîto $5 million. Subject to the achievement of performance criteria  he will be eligible for an annual bonus with a target of $10 million. The EBITA bonus from his prior employment agreement has been eliminated and Grainge will only be entitled to the contingent bonus under his prior employment agreement on a pro rata basis until March 31  2023.The equity components of the program include annual grants of $20 million  comprised of as much as 50% Performance Share Units (PSUs)‚Äîwith annual PSU goals set by the Board of Directors‚Äîand the remainder comprised of Restricted Share Units (RSUs).
