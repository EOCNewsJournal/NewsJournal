Acquisition of Savings Shares shall be made through the company on Nasdaq Stockholm within twenty trading days from when the outcome of the variable cash remuneration program has been established and the participants have informed Eolus whether they want to participate in the Share Savings Program.Provided that the participant still holds all of the Savings Shares and is still employed within the Eolus group three years after the acquisition of Savings Shares  Eolus will remunerate the participant with an amount corresponding to the cost for acquiring the number of Eolus shares corresponding to half of the number of Savings Shares (‚ÄúMatching Shares‚Äù). Acquisition of Matching Shares shall be made through the company on Nasdaq Stockholm within twenty trading days from the date falling three years after the acquisition of Savings Shares.In order to ensure that the participant‚Äôs financial situation as far as possible shall remain unchanged  the number of Matching Shares shall be subject to customary recalculation should the company‚Äôs share capital increase or decrease  convertible debt instruments or options be issued or the company be liquidated or merged  or any similar changes to the company occur.Should the participant be prohibited from acquiring Savings Shares due to possession of inside information  the Board of Directors may in individual cases prolong or postpone the above mentioned investment period  although not beyond the next year end (i.e. until and including 31 December 2024). The Board of Directors shall be responsible for the detailed conditions and the administration of the Share Savings Program 2023 within the terms and conditions set forth above  and may also make such minor adjustments and applications as may be appropriate for legal or administrative reasons.Based on the assumptions of maximum outcome in the variable cash remuneration program  full investments by the entitled participants and an unchanged share price at the time of delivery of the Matching Shares  Eolus‚Äô costs relating to the Share Savings Program 2023 are estimated to amount to a maximum of approximately SEK 3.2 million. Assuming a 25 per cent increase in Eolus‚Äô share price at the time of delivery of Matching Shares  Eolus‚Äô costs relating to the Share Savings Program 2023  including employer contributions  are estimated to amount to a maximum of approximately SEK 4.0 million and assuming a 50 per cent increase in the share price at such time  the costs are estimated to amount to a maximum of approximately SEK 4.9 million  including employer contributions. The Share Savings Program 2023 does not result in any dilution of the holdings of the company‚Äôs shareholders and is not deemed to affect any performance measure important for Eolus. No measures have been taken to hedge Eolus‚Äô costs against its own share price in connection with the purchase of Matching shares.The proposal on Share Savings Program 2023 has been prepared by the Board of Directors and the Remuneration Committee. In the company  similar share savings programs for the financial years 2022  2021 and 2019/2020 relating to the variable cash remuneration have previously been adopted. By requiring  as described above  that the participants make an own investment in Eolus shares and thereby reconciling the employees‚Äô and the shareholders‚Äô interests of a long-term increase of the company‚Äôs value  the Share Savings Program 2023 is expected to enhance Eolus‚Äô possibilities to recruit and retain competent employees while at the same time promoting Eolus‚Äô business strategy  long-term interests and sustainability.The proposal must be supported by shareholders representing more than half of the votes cast at the general meeting.Available documentationThe Nomination Committee‚Äôs reasoned statement  form of power of attorney and postal voting form are available at the company and on the company‚Äôs website  www.eolusvind.com/en/.The financial statements  the audit report and other documentation that shall be available for the shareholders according to the Swedish Companies Act will be available at the company and on the company‚Äôs website  www.eolusvind.com/en/  no later than three weeks before the AGM.The documents will be sent free of charge to shareholders who so request and state their address.Number of shares and votes in the companyAt the time of issue of this convening notice  the total number of shares in the company amounts to 24 907 000  of which 1 285 625 shares are Class A shares and 23 621 375 shares are Class B shares. The total number of votes in the company amounts to 3 647 762.5.Information at the AGMThe Board of Directors and the CEO shall  if any shareholder so request and if the Board of Directors considers that this can be done without significant harm for the company or its subsidiaries  give information on circumstances that can affect the assessment of an item on the agenda  circumstances that can affect the assessment of the financial situation of the company or its subsidiaries and the company‚Äôs relationship with another group company (including the consolidated financial statements).Processing of personal dataFor information about the processing of your personal data  see www.euroclear.com/dam/ESwithLegal/Privacy-notice-bolagsstammor-engelska.pdf.H√§ssleholm in March 2023Eolus Vind AB (publ)The Board of DirectorsFor further information  please contact:Per Witalisson  CEO  +46 (0)702 65 16 15Karin Wittsell Heydl  Head of Communications & Sustainability  +46 (0)761 16 71 99Attachment",neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.31,0.15,0.53,True,English,"['Annual General Meeting', 'Eolus Vind AB', 'Notice', 'P.O.

The demerger plan is available on Sampo plc‚Äôs website at www.sampo.com/agm .Pursuant to the demerger plan  Sampo plc will demerge in a partial demerger so that all of the shares in Mandatum Holding Ltd (a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of Sampo plc) owned by Sampo plc and related assets and liabilities will transfer without a liquidation procedure to Mandatum plc  a company to be incorporated in the demerger.The purpose of the demerger is to implement the divestment of the life insurance  wealth management business and related operations carried out by Mandatum Holding Ltd through its direct and indirect subsidiaries in order to form a new independent group of companies. The planned date of registration of the completion of the partial demerger is 1 October 2023 (the ‚ÄúEffective Date‚Äù).

For the sake of clarity  the demerger consideration shall be delivered through the book-entry system without any separate action being required from the shareholders of Sampo plc in relation thereto.The shares in Mandatum plc are intended to be admitted to trading on the official list of Nasdaq Helsinki Ltd. Trading is intended to begin on the Effective Date  or in case the Effective Date does not fall on a trading day  the first potential trading day following the Effective Date.As part of the demerger resolution the Annual General Meeting resolves on  conditional upon the registration of the completion of the demerger:The establishment of Mandatum plc and the approval of its articles of associationThe receiving company in the demerger is established in connection with the registration of the completion of the demerger.

The Board of Directors of Mandatum plc may however take certain decisions on behalf of Mandatum plc already prior to the Effective Date  as set forth in the demerger plan.Prior to assuming the duties of a Board member of Mandatum plc  each such person must fulfil the Fitness & Propriety requirements set by the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority.It is proposed that each member of the Board of Directors of Mandatum plc be remunerated in accordance with the demerger plan approved and signed by Sampo plc‚Äôs Board of Directors on 29 March 2023.According to the proposed articles of association of Mandatum plc  Mandatum plc shall have one (1) auditor which must be an auditing firm authorised by the Finnish Patent and Registration Office.

In addition  the board of directors is granted the right to terminate or adjust the program in case of a takeover bid or a similar event. The board of directors shall also have the right to make other adjustments if significant changes in the Medivir group or its environment would result in a situation where the adopted terms and conditions of LTIP 2023 no longer serve their purpose.Allocation.The participants are divided into different categories and  in accordance with the above  the following number of Investment Shares may be allocated by the participants to LTIP 2023 and the following number of Rights may be allocated to the particpants in the different categories:Category Maximum number of Investment Shares per person in the category Maximum number of Rights per person in the category Maximum number of Rights Matching Rights Performance Rights Matching Rights Performance Rights A.

Other employees (not more than6 persons) 6 500 6 500 32 500 39 000 195 000In total  not more than 813 000 Rights may be allotted under LTIP 2023. Participants in category A and B may acquire Investment Shares to an amount corresponding to approximately 10 per cent of the participant's annual base salary. Participants in category C may acquire Investment Shares to an amount corresponding to approximately 5‚Äì10 per cent of the participant's annual base salary.In case not all participants invest their full part of Investment Shares by the end of the notification period  the other participants are entitled to invest in additional a maximum of 50 per cent Investment Shares in accordance with the instructions of the board of directors  which shall entitle to the corresponding Rights. There will be no guaranteed allocation in connection with an investment in additional Investment Shares. In case of over notification by the above persons covered by the allotment principles  the allotment shall be made as follows. First  allocation shall be made pro rata in relation to the number of additional invested Investment Shares. Secondarily  allocation shall be made through the drawing of lots executed by the board of directors.Delivery of shares under LTIP 2023To ensure delivery of shares under LTIP 2023  the board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to authorize the board of directors to resolve on issue of shares of series C and on repurchase of shares of series C and resolves on transfer of own shares of series B in accordance with item (b) below.Scope and costs of LTIP 2023LTIP 2023 will be accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2 which stipulates that the Rights should be recorded as non-cash personnel expenses during the period of LTIP 2023. The costs for LTIP 2023 is estimated to amount to approximately SEK 2.3 million  excluding social security costs  calculated in accordance with IFRS 2 based on the following assumptions: (i) that 135 000 Matching Rights and 677 500 Performance Shares are allotted  (ii) that the price of the company's share immediately before the start of LTIP 2023 amounts to SEK 8.00 per share (closing price on 22 March 2023)  (iii) an estimated annual turnover of personnel of 10 per cent and (iv) that the TSR during the Performance Period amounts to 75 per cent.The costs for social security charges are estimated to approximately SEK 1.7 million  based on the above assumptions and a social security tax rate of 31.42 per cent. Together with the IFRS 2 cost  this will result in estimated costs of SEK 4.0 million. In addition to what is set forth above  the costs for LTIP 2023 have been based on that LTIP 2023 comprises not more than 11 participants and that each participant exercises its maximum investment.Effects on key ratios and dilutionUpon maximum allotment of 135 500 Matching Shares  677 500 Performance Shares and provided that the hedging arrangements in accordance with item 20(b) below are adopted by the annual general meeting  835 000 shares of series B will be allotted to participants under LTIP 2023  including a buffer of 22 000 shares of series B for dividend compensations  meaning a dilution of approximately 1.50 per cent of the number of shares and votes in the company. In addition  LTIP 2023 comprises allotment of 135 500 Investment Shares to the participants at the volume weighted average share price during the five trading days immediately prior to the offer to each participant to acquire the Investment Shares  meaning a dilution of approximately 0.24 per cent of the number of shares and votes in the company. This is conditional upon the annual general meeting resolving to adopt the proposed hedging arrangements in accordance with item 20(b) below.Taking into account shares that may be issued in accordance with previously implemented incentive programs in the form of warrant programs in the company and in accordance with the share matching program proposed to the annual general meeting with respect to the maximum number of Matching Shares and Performance Shares  the maximal dilution effect is approximately 4.35 per cent.The costs are expected to have a limited effect on the company's key ratios.The rationale for the proposalThe rationale for LTIP 2023 is to create conditions for motivating and retaining competent employees of the Medivir group as well as for the alignment of the targets of the participants with those of the company  as well as to increase the motivation of meeting and exceeding the company's financial targets. LTIP 2023 has been designed based on the view that it is desirable that key employees within the Medivir group are shareholders in the company. Participation in LTIP 2023 requires a personal investment in Investment Shares.By offering an allotment of Rights which  inter alia  are based on performance conditions  the participants are rewarded for increased shareholder value. Further  LTIP 2023 rewards employees' continued loyalty and thereby the long-term value growth in the company. Against this background  the board of directors is of the opinion that the adoption of LTIP 2023 will have a positive effect on the Medivir group's future development and thus be beneficial for both the company and its shareholders.Preparation of the matterThe principles of LTIP 2023 have been prepared by the board of directors of the company. The board of directors has thereafter resolved to submit this proposal to the annual general meeting. Except for the officials who prepared the matter pursuant to instructions from the board of directors  no employee that may be included in the program has taken part in the drafting thereof.Other share related incentive programs etc.Except from the current proposal to adopt a share matching program and the previous warrant programs resolved upon at the annual general meetings 2020  2021 and 2022  the company has no outstanding share related incentive programs. It is the board of directors's intention that the program shall recur annually  albeit in varying sizes.Proposal regarding authorization for the board of directors to resolve on a directed share issue of shares of series C and to repurchase issued shares of series C as well as resolution on transfer of own shares of series B to participants in LTIP 2023 and in the market (item 20 (b))The resolutions under items 20 (b)(i) - (iii) are proposed to be conditional upon i) that the annual general meeting resolves in accordance with the board of directors' proposal in accordance with item 18 regarding the adoption of new articles of association  and ii) upon each other. It is therefore proposed that the resolutions under items 20 (b)(i) - (iii) are adopted jointly.Authorization for the board of directors to resolve on issue of shares of series C (item 20 (b)(i))The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to authorize the board of directors  during the period until the next annual general meeting  at one or several occasions  to increase the company's share capital by not more than SEK 485 250 by the issue of not more than 970 500 shares of series C  each with a quota value of SEK 0.50. With deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights  a participating third party shall be entitled to subscribe for the new shares of series C at a subscription price corresponding to the quota value of the shares. The purpose of the authorization and the reason for the deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights in connection with the issue of shares is to enable for participants in LTIP 2023 to acquire Investment Shares  ensure delivery of shares under LTIP 2023 as well as to cover any social costs and dividend compensations due to LTIP 2023.Authorization for the board of directors to resolve to repurchase own shares of series C (item 20 (b)(ii))The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to authorize the board of directors  during the period until the next annual general meeting  at one or several occasions  to repurchase shares of series C. The repurchase may only be effected through a public offer directed to all holders of shares of series C and shall comprise all outstanding shares of series C. The purchase may be effected at a purchase price corresponding to the quota value of the share. Payment for the shares of series C shall be made in cash. The purpose of the proposed repurchase authorization is to enable for participants in LTIP 2023 to acquire Investment Shares  ensure delivery of shares under LTIP 2023 as well as to cover any social costs due to LTIP 2023.Resolution on the transfer of own shares of series B (item 20 (b)(iii))The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves that 835 000 shares of series C that the company purchases by virtue of the authorization to repurchase shares of series C in accordance with item 20 (b)(ii) above  following reclassification into shares of series B  may be transferred free of charge to participants in LTIP 2023 in accordance with resolved conditions and transferred to cover any social costs due to LTIP 2023.The board of directors thus proposes that the annual general meeting resolves that a maximum of 981 913 shares of series B held by the company  including such shares of series B that the company holds after previously completed repurchases  may be transferred to participants in accordance with the terms of LTIP 2023  and that it may be transferred on Nasdaq Stockholm  including through a financial intermediary  at a price within the price range registered at the time  to cover any social security contributions in accordance with the terms of LTIP 2023. The number of shares that can be transferred is subject to recalculation as a result of an in-between bonus issue  share split  share split  rights issue and/or similar events.The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves that 135 000 of the shares of series C that the company purchases by virtue of the authorization to repurchase shares of series C in accordance with item 20 (b)(ii) above  following reclassification into shares of series B  may be transferred to employees in Medivir to enable for acquisitions of Investment Shares for participation in LTIP 2023. The board of directors therefore proposes that a maximum of 135 500 shares of series B may be transferred to employees of Medivir. The transfer price shall amount to the volume weighted average share price during the five trading days immediately prior to the date of the offer to each participant to acquire Investment Shares.Majority requirementsA decision according to the proposal pursuant to item 18 and 19 above is valid only when supported by shareholders holding not less than two-thirds (2/3) of both the votes cast and of the shares represented at the annual general meeting.

The Board of Directors proposes that the authorization entitles the Board to deviate from the shareholders' proportional shareholdings (directed acquisition). Own shares can be acquired at a price formed in public trading on the date of the acquisition or at a price otherwise formed on the market.The shares may be used to carry out acquisitions or other arrangements pertaining to the company‚Äôs business operations  to develop the capital structure of the company  as part of the incentive plans  or to be otherwise invalidated or conveyed. In connection with the share repurchase ordinary derivative  stock lending  and other agreements may be made in the market in accordance with the laws and regulations.The authorization includes the right for the Board of Directors to decide on all other matters related to the acquisition of shares.

A right may also be given to a creditor in such manner that the right includes a condition that the creditor's receivable is used to set off the subscription price (convertible loan). The subscription price of the new shares and the amount paid for the company's own shares will be added to the fund for invested unrestricted equity.The authorization entitles the Board to deviate from the from the pre-emptive subscription rights of the existing shareholders  provided that the company has an important financial reason to do so  as regards the issue against payment  and that there is an especially important reason for the company and the good of the shareholders to do so  as regards the free issue. Within the limits set above  the authorization could be used  for example  to develop the capital structure  to widen the ownership base  in making a payment for an acquisition  when the company buys property related to its business operations  or incentive or reward program for employees and management at Innofactor group. New issue or transfer of own shares could also be used as a contribution in kind or when using the set-off right.In addition  the authorization includes also the right to decide on a free share issue to the company itself in such a manner that  after the issue  the number of shares in the company's possession is at the maximum one tenth (1/10) of the total number of shares in the company.

Acquisition of Savings Shares shall be made through the company on Nasdaq Stockholm within twenty trading days from when the outcome of the variable cash remuneration program has been established and the participants have informed Eolus whether they want to participate in the Share Savings Program.Provided that the participant still holds all of the Savings Shares and is still employed within the Eolus group three years after the acquisition of Savings Shares  Eolus will remunerate the participant with an amount corresponding to the cost for acquiring the number of Eolus shares corresponding to half of the number of Savings Shares (‚ÄúMatching Shares‚Äù). Acquisition of Matching Shares shall be made through the company on Nasdaq Stockholm within twenty trading days from the date falling three years after the acquisition of Savings Shares.In order to ensure that the participant‚Äôs financial situation as far as possible shall remain unchanged  the number of Matching Shares shall be subject to customary recalculation should the company‚Äôs share capital increase or decrease  convertible debt instruments or options be issued or the company be liquidated or merged  or any similar changes to the company occur.Should the participant be prohibited from acquiring Savings Shares due to possession of inside information  the Board of Directors may in individual cases prolong or postpone the above mentioned investment period  although not beyond the next year end (i.e. until and including 31 December 2024). The Board of Directors shall be responsible for the detailed conditions and the administration of the Share Savings Program 2023 within the terms and conditions set forth above  and may also make such minor adjustments and applications as may be appropriate for legal or administrative reasons.Based on the assumptions of maximum outcome in the variable cash remuneration program  full investments by the entitled participants and an unchanged share price at the time of delivery of the Matching Shares  Eolus‚Äô costs relating to the Share Savings Program 2023 are estimated to amount to a maximum of approximately SEK 3.2 million. Assuming a 25 per cent increase in Eolus‚Äô share price at the time of delivery of Matching Shares  Eolus‚Äô costs relating to the Share Savings Program 2023  including employer contributions  are estimated to amount to a maximum of approximately SEK 4.0 million and assuming a 50 per cent increase in the share price at such time  the costs are estimated to amount to a maximum of approximately SEK 4.9 million  including employer contributions. The Share Savings Program 2023 does not result in any dilution of the holdings of the company‚Äôs shareholders and is not deemed to affect any performance measure important for Eolus. No measures have been taken to hedge Eolus‚Äô costs against its own share price in connection with the purchase of Matching shares.The proposal on Share Savings Program 2023 has been prepared by the Board of Directors and the Remuneration Committee. In the company  similar share savings programs for the financial years 2022  2021 and 2019/2020 relating to the variable cash remuneration have previously been adopted. By requiring  as described above  that the participants make an own investment in Eolus shares and thereby reconciling the employees‚Äô and the shareholders‚Äô interests of a long-term increase of the company‚Äôs value  the Share Savings Program 2023 is expected to enhance Eolus‚Äô possibilities to recruit and retain competent employees while at the same time promoting Eolus‚Äô business strategy  long-term interests and sustainability.The proposal must be supported by shareholders representing more than half of the votes cast at the general meeting.Available documentationThe Nomination Committee‚Äôs reasoned statement  form of power of attorney and postal voting form are available at the company and on the company‚Äôs website  www.eolusvind.com/en/.The financial statements  the audit report and other documentation that shall be available for the shareholders according to the Swedish Companies Act will be available at the company and on the company‚Äôs website  www.eolusvind.com/en/  no later than three weeks before the AGM.The documents will be sent free of charge to shareholders who so request and state their address.Number of shares and votes in the companyAt the time of issue of this convening notice  the total number of shares in the company amounts to 24 907 000  of which 1 285 625 shares are Class A shares and 23 621 375 shares are Class B shares.

Acquisition of Savings Shares shall be made through the company on Nasdaq Stockholm within twenty trading days from when the outcome of the variable cash remuneration program has been established and the participants have informed Eolus whether they want to participate in the Share Savings Program.Provided that the participant still holds all of the Savings Shares and is still employed within the Eolus group three years after the acquisition of Savings Shares  Eolus will remunerate the participant with an amount corresponding to the cost for acquiring the number of Eolus shares corresponding to half of the number of Savings Shares (‚ÄúMatching Shares‚Äù). Acquisition of Matching Shares shall be made through the company on Nasdaq Stockholm within twenty trading days from the date falling three years after the acquisition of Savings Shares.In order to ensure that the participant‚Äôs financial situation as far as possible shall remain unchanged  the number of Matching Shares shall be subject to customary recalculation should the company‚Äôs share capital increase or decrease  convertible debt instruments or options be issued or the company be liquidated or merged  or any similar changes to the company occur.Should the participant be prohibited from acquiring Savings Shares due to possession of inside information  the Board of Directors may in individual cases prolong or postpone the above mentioned investment period  although not beyond the next year end (i.e. until and including 31 December 2024). The Board of Directors shall be responsible for the detailed conditions and the administration of the Share Savings Program 2023 within the terms and conditions set forth above  and may also make such minor adjustments and applications as may be appropriate for legal or administrative reasons.Based on the assumptions of maximum outcome in the variable cash remuneration program  full investments by the entitled participants and an unchanged share price at the time of delivery of the Matching Shares  Eolus‚Äô costs relating to the Share Savings Program 2023 are estimated to amount to a maximum of approximately SEK 3.2 million. Assuming a 25 per cent increase in Eolus‚Äô share price at the time of delivery of Matching Shares  Eolus‚Äô costs relating to the Share Savings Program 2023  including employer contributions  are estimated to amount to a maximum of approximately SEK 4.0 million and assuming a 50 per cent increase in the share price at such time  the costs are estimated to amount to a maximum of approximately SEK 4.9 million  including employer contributions. The Share Savings Program 2023 does not result in any dilution of the holdings of the company‚Äôs shareholders and is not deemed to affect any performance measure important for Eolus. No measures have been taken to hedge Eolus‚Äô costs against its own share price in connection with the purchase of Matching shares.The proposal on Share Savings Program 2023 has been prepared by the Board of Directors and the Remuneration Committee. In the company  similar share savings programs for the financial years 2022  2021 and 2019/2020 relating to the variable cash remuneration have previously been adopted. By requiring  as described above  that the participants make an own investment in Eolus shares and thereby reconciling the employees‚Äô and the shareholders‚Äô interests of a long-term increase of the company‚Äôs value  the Share Savings Program 2023 is expected to enhance Eolus‚Äô possibilities to recruit and retain competent employees while at the same time promoting Eolus‚Äô business strategy  long-term interests and sustainability.The proposal must be supported by shareholders representing more than half of the votes cast at the general meeting.Available documentationThe Nomination Committee‚Äôs reasoned statement  form of power of attorney and postal voting form are available at the company and on the company‚Äôs website  www.eolusvind.com/en/.The financial statements  the audit report and other documentation that shall be available for the shareholders according to the Swedish Companies Act will be available at the company and on the company‚Äôs website  www.eolusvind.com/en/  no later than three weeks before the AGM.The documents will be sent free of charge to shareholders who so request and state their address.Number of shares and votes in the companyAt the time of issue of this convening notice  the total number of shares in the company amounts to 24 907 000  of which 1 285 625 shares are Class A shares and 23 621 375 shares are Class B shares.

For the sake of clarity  the demerger consideration shall be delivered through the book-entry system without any separate action being required from the shareholders of Sampo plc in relation thereto.The shares in Mandatum plc are intended to be admitted to trading on the official list of Nasdaq Helsinki Ltd.

The Board of Directors of Mandatum plc may however take certain decisions on behalf of Mandatum plc already prior to the Effective Date  as set forth in the demerger plan.Prior to assuming the duties of a Board member of Mandatum plc  each such person must fulfil the Fitness & Propriety requirements set by the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority.It is proposed that each member of the Board of Directors of Mandatum plc be remunerated in accordance with the demerger plan approved and signed by Sampo plc‚Äôs Board of Directors on 29 March 2023.According to the proposed articles of association of Mandatum plc  Mandatum plc shall have one (1) auditor which must be an auditing firm authorised by the Finnish Patent and Registration Office.

The record date for the first payment is proposed to be May 8  2023  and for the second payment November 20  2023. If the AGM so resolves  the first payment is expected to be distributed by Euroclear Sweden AB starting May 11  2023  and the second payment starting November 23  2023. The Board has presented a motivated statement pursuant to Chapter 18  Section 4 of the Swedish Companies Act.Item 16 ‚Äì Proposal for resolution on authorization of the Board to resolve on acquisition and transfer of the company's own sharesThe Board proposes that the AGM authorizes the Board to resolve upon acquisition of the company's own shares of Series B according to the following terms: (i) acquisition of shares may take place on Nasdaq Stockholm  (ii) acquisition of shares may take place on one or several occasions during the time up to the AGM 2024  (iii) acquisition of shares may only be made so that the shares held by the company at any point in time does not exceed ten (10) percent of all shares in the company  (iv) acquisition of shares shall be made at a price which falls within the prevailing price interval registered at each point in time  meaning the interval between the highest purchase price and the lowest selling price  (v) payment for acquired shares shall be made in cash  and (vi) the Board should be authorized to decide upon any additional terms for the acquisition.Furthermore  the Board proposes that the AGM authorizes the Board to resolve upon transfer of the company's own shares of Series B according to the following terms: (i) transfer of shares may take place on Nasdaq Stockholm or in connection with acquisition of companies or businesses  on market terms  (ii) transfer of shares may take place on one or several occasions during the time up to the AGM 2024  (iii) the maximum number of shares to be transferred may not exceed the number of shares held by the company at the time of the Board's resolution  (iv) transfer of shares shall be made at a price which falls within the prevailing price interval registered at each point in time  meaning the interval between the highest purchase price and the lowest selling price  (v) payment for transferred shares may be made in other forms than cash  and (vi) the Board should be authorized to decide upon any additional terms for the transfer. The authorization includes the right to resolve on deviation of the preferential rights of shareholders.The purpose of the proposed authorizations is to (a) allow the Board to adjust the company's capital structure  to contribute to shareholder value  (b) be able to exploit attractive acquisition opportunities by fully or partly financing future acquisitions with the company's own shares  and (c) ensure the company's undertakings in respect of share-related or share-based incentive programs (other than delivery of shares to participants of incentive programs)  including covering social security costs. If the Board decides to adjust the company's capital structure in accordance with (a) above  the Board intends to propose that the company's share capital shall be decreased through share reduction of the repurchased shares.The Board has presented a motivated statement pursuant to Chapter 19  Section 22 of the Swedish Companies Act.A decision by the AGM on the proposal according to this item must be supported by shareholders representing at least two thirds of the votes cast as well as the shares present at the AGM in order for the proposal to be adopted.Item 17 ‚Äì Proposal for a long-term incentive program  including hedging measures by way of a share swap agreement (LTI 2023/2025)Summary of the programThe Annual General Meetings 2019  2020  2021 and 2022 resolved on long-term incentive programs for the CEO  other members of Group management and certain other key employees within the Securitas Group (together the ""LTI Programs""). The Board proposes that the AGM resolves to implement a long-term incentive program (""LTI 2023/2025"")  with the main principles below.LTI 2023/2025 is proposed to include approximately 90 employees including the CEO  other members of Group management and certain other key employees within the Securitas Group. In order to participate in the LTI 2023/2025  the participants will have to invest in Series B shares in Securitas at market price or nominate Series B shares already held  as further set out below. For every Series B share purchased or nominated within the scope of LTI 2023/2025  the company will award so called performance awards free of charge in accordance with the terms stipulated below.A change compared to previous LTI Programs is that the performance condition for LTI 2023/2025 is based on Securitas' operating margin  instead of the parameter earnings per share. This is in line with the new financial targets presented by Securitas in 2022  where a new operating margin target replaced the previous target of an increase in earnings per share.The rationale for the proposalThe purpose of LTI 2023/2025 is to create a strong long-term incentive for top executives of the Group  strengthen the Group's ability to retain and recruit top executives  provide competitive remuneration  and to align the interests of the shareholders with the interests of the executives concerned by enabling the participants to become substantial shareholders in the company. Through a share-based incentive program  the employees' remuneration is tied to the company's future earnings and value growth. In light of the above  the Board believes that the implementation of LTI 2023/2025 will have a positive effect on the long-term value growth of the Group and consequently that LTI 2023/2025 is beneficial to both the shareholders and the company.Personally invested sharesIn order to participate in LTI 2023/2025  the participants will  with the exceptions stated below  during the period May 8  2023 ‚Äì June 8  2023 (the ""Investment Period"") have to either (i) purchase Series B shares in Securitas in the market and nominate such shares to LTI 2023/2025  (ii) nominate Series B shares currently vesting in LTI 2020/2022  or (iii) nominate shares nominated in LTI 2020/2022[1] (""Personally Invested Shares"").The value of a participant's Personally Invested Shares shall be based on the market price for the company's Series B share and shall correspond to minimum 5 percent (all participants) and maximum 15 percent (the CEO)  12.5 percent (other members of Group management) or 10 percent (other participants)  respectively  of the participant's base salary.If the participant has access to inside information and therefore is prevented from purchasing or nominating Personally Invested Shares during the Investment Period  the Board shall be entitled to extend or postpone the Investment Period in individual cases  but no later than to the next AGM. The Board shall further  in individual cases  be entitled to accept nomination of shares acquired prior to the Investment Period  but not earlier than January 1  2023  and/or acquired through e.g. a pension insurance as Personally Invested Shares  where the participant  in the Board's opinion  has valid reasons for nominating such shares to LTI 2023/2025.Participants in LTI 2023/2025 and allocationLTI 2023/2025 is proposed to include approximately 90 senior executives and key employees within the Securitas Group  divided in three categories.Category 1For each Personally Invested Share by the CEO of the Group under LTI 2023/2025  the company will award five performance awards to the CEO.Category 2For each Personally Invested Share by another member of Group management (currently thirteen individuals) under LTI 2023/2025  the relevant individual will be awarded four performance awards.Category 3For each Personally Invested Share by another participant under LTI 2023/2025  the relevant individual will be awarded three performance awards.Performance conditionThe number of Series B shares that the performance awards will entitle the participant to receive depends on the development of Securitas' operating margin[2]  compared to minimum and maximum target levels as defined by the Board  during the measurement period January 1  2023 ‚Äì December 31  2025.If the minimum level is not reached  the performance awards will entitle participants to receive zero Series B shares  whereas if the maximum level is reached  each performance award will entitle participants to receive one Series B share. If the outcome falls between the minimum level and the maximum level  participants' entitlement to Series B shares will be calculated linearly between zero and one Series B share per performance award. The Board intends to present the fulfilment of the performance-based condition in the Annual Report for the financial year 2025.Other conditionsIn addition to the above conditions  the following shall apply for the performance awards.The performance awards shall be awarded free of charge at the end of the Investment Period  subject to vesting.Each performance award entitles the holder to receive one Series B share free of charge (subject to the performance condition set out above) three years after allotment of the award (the ""Vesting Period"")  provided that the holder  with some exceptions  is still employed by the Securitas Group as per December 31  2025   and has maintained the full amount of Personally Invested Shares purchased or nominated under LTI 2023/2025 during the entire Vesting Period.  and has maintained the full amount of Personally Invested Shares purchased or nominated under LTI 2023/2025 during the entire Vesting Period. To make the participants' interest equal with the shareholders'  the company will compensate the participants for distributed dividend during the Vesting Period by increasing the number of Series B shares that each performance award may entitle the participant to receive after the Vesting Period.The number of Series B shares that each performance award may entitle the participant to receive may be subject to recalculation due to share issues  splits  reverse splits and similar dispositions.The performance awards are non-transferable and may not be pledged.The performance awards can be awarded by the company or any other company within the Group.Preparation and administrationThe Board shall be responsible for preparing the detailed terms and conditions of LTI 2023/2025 in accordance with the mentioned terms and guidelines. To this end  the Board shall be entitled to make adjustments to meet foreign regulations or market conditions. The Board may also make other adjustments if significant changes in the Securitas Group  or its operating environment  would result in a situation where the decided terms and conditions for LTI 2023/2025 no longer are appropriate. Such adjustments include a right for the Board to resolve on a reduction of the number of Series B shares that the performance awards would entitle a participant to receive  if the number of Series B shares that a participant would be entitled to ‚Äì considering Securitas' result and financial position  other circumstances regarding the Group's development and the conditions on the stock market ‚Äì would be clearly unreasonable.Furthermore  in the event that the Board considers that the delivery of shares under LTI 2023/2025 cannot be achieved at reasonable cost  with reasonable administrative efforts or due to specific market conditions  participants may instead be offered a cash settlement.Participation in LTI 2023/2025 also presumes that such participation is lawful and that such participation in Securitas' opinion can take place with reasonable administrative costs and economic efforts. The Board shall be entitled to implement an alternative incentive solution for employees in such countries where participation in LTI 2023/2025 is not advisable  which alternative solution shall  as far as practically possible  correspond to the terms of the LTI 2023/2025.Scope and cost of the programLTI 2023/2025 may  if the share price for the company's Series B share remains the same during the program's term  result in a maximum amount corresponding to 75 percent (CEO)  50 percent (other members of Group management) or 30 percent (other participants)  respectively  of the participants annual base salary (excluding social security costs). Such outcome is subject to the number of Personally Invested Shares being maximized  meaning that the value of the participant's Personally Invested Shares corresponds to 15 percent (the CEO)  12.5 percent (other members of Group management) or 10 percent (other participants)  respectively  of the participants annual base salary  that the participant maintains the full amount of Personally Invested Shares during the entire Vesting Period  and that the participant  with some exceptions  still is employed as per December 31  2025  and that the performance based condition has been fully achieved.The maximum number of Series B shares that a participant may nominate as Personally Invested Shares  and thus the total number of performance awards that may be allotted  shall be based on the market price for the company's Series B share. The total number of issued shares in the company amounts to 573 392 552 shares.Based on the assumption that the share price for the company's Series B share amounts to SEK 91  LTI 2023/2025 will  in accordance with the principles and assumptions set out above  comprise maximum 1 430 000 Series B shares in total  which corresponds to approximately 0.25 percent of the total number of issued shares in the company and 0.18 percent of the total number of votes in the company.The costs for LTI 2023/2025 should be expensed as personnel costs over the Vesting Period. Provided that the performance-based condition is fully achieved  the cost for LTI 2023/2025 before tax is  in accordance with the principles and assumptions set out above  estimated to approximately SEK 130 million  allocated over the Vesting Period. Estimated social security costs and financing costs are included in such amount.The Board proposes the AGM to resolve to authorize the Board to resolve on repurchase of shares in the company and to transfer such shares on a regulated market to cover social security costs and financing costs associated with LTI 2023/2025 (see separate item on the agenda).The costs for LTI 2023/2025 are expected to have marginal effect on key ratios of the Securitas Group.The Board deems that the positive effects on earnings that are expected to result from increased share ownership among senior management and key employees  which may be further increased through LTI 2023/2025  outweighs the costs related to LTI 2023/2025.All estimates are based on at each time applicable foreign exchange rates according to Reuters. Information on previous LTI Programs can be found in the Annual Report 2022  notes 9 and 12.Delivery of shares under LTI 2023/2025 and hedging measuresTo ensure the delivery of Series B shares under LTI 2023/2025  the company may enter into a share-swap agreement with a third party  whereby the third party in its own name shall acquire and transfer Series B shares in the company to employees participating in LTI 2023/2025. The cost for the swap is estimated at a maximum of SEK 600 000 assuming that the performance-based condition is fully achieved.Preparation of the proposal and voting majorityLTI 2023/2025 has been initiated by the Board and the Remuneration Committee of Securitas in consultation with major shareholders and has been structured in consultation with external advisers based on an evaluation of previous incentive schemes. LTI 2023/2025 has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee and reviewed at meetings of the Board. The resolution must be supported by shareholders representing more than half of the votes cast  or  in case of equal voting  supported by the Chair of the AGM.Other informationAvailable documentation etc.The Annual Report and the Auditor's Report  the remuneration report and all other supporting documentation for the AGM are available at the company and on the company website www.securitas.com/agm2023 no later than three weeks before the AGM.The Nomination Committee's complete proposals and motivated statement are available at the company and on the company website www.securitas.com/agm2023.In addition  copies of the documentation will be sent to the shareholders who so request  indicating their mailing address.

The Board's proposals Item 9 (b) and (c) ‚Äì Proposal for dividend and record date The Board proposes that a dividend of SEK 3.45 per share is distributed to the shareholders in two payments of SEK 1.75 per share and SEK 1.70 per share  respectively. The record date for the first payment is proposed to be May 8  2023  and for the second payment November 20  2023. If the AGM so resolves  the first payment is expected to be distributed by Euroclear Sweden AB starting May 11  2023  and the second payment starting November 23  2023. The Board has presented a motivated statement pursuant to Chapter 18  Section 4 of the Swedish Companies Act. Item 16 ‚Äì Proposal for resolution on authorization of the Board to resolve on acquisition and transfer of the company's own shares The Board proposes that the AGM authorizes the Board to resolve upon acquisition of the company's own shares of Series B according to the following terms: (i) acquisition of shares may take place on Nasdaq Stockholm  (ii) acquisition of shares may take place on one or several occasions during the time up to the AGM 2024  (iii) acquisition of shares may only be made so that the shares held by the company at any point in time does not exceed ten (10) percent of all shares in the company  (iv) acquisition of shares shall be made at a price which falls within the prevailing price interval registered at each point in time  meaning the interval between the highest purchase price and the lowest selling price  (v) payment for acquired shares shall be made in cash  and (vi) the Board should be authorized to decide upon any additional terms for the acquisition. Furthermore  the Board proposes that the AGM authorizes the Board to resolve upon transfer of the company's own shares of Series B according to the following terms: (i) transfer of shares may take place on Nasdaq Stockholm or in connection with acquisition of companies or businesses  on market terms  (ii) transfer of shares may take place on one or several occasions during the time up to the AGM 2024  (iii) the maximum number of shares to be transferred may not exceed the number of shares held by the company at the time of the Board's resolution  (iv) transfer of shares shall be made at a price which falls within the prevailing price interval registered at each point in time  meaning the interval between the highest purchase price and the lowest selling price  (v) payment for transferred shares may be made in other forms than cash  and (vi) the Board should be authorized to decide upon any additional terms for the transfer. The authorization includes the right to resolve on deviation of the preferential rights of shareholders. The purpose of the proposed authorizations is to (a) allow the Board to adjust the company's capital structure  to contribute to shareholder value  (b) be able to exploit attractive acquisition opportunities by fully or partly financing future acquisitions with the company's own shares  and (c) ensure the company's undertakings in respect of share-related or share-based incentive programs (other than delivery of shares to participants of incentive programs)  including covering social security costs. If the Board decides to adjust the company's capital structure in accordance with (a) above  the Board intends to propose that the company's share capital shall be decreased through share reduction of the repurchased shares. The Board has presented a motivated statement pursuant to Chapter 19  Section 22 of the Swedish Companies Act. A decision by the AGM on the proposal according to this item must be supported by shareholders representing at least two thirds of the votes cast as well as the shares present at the AGM in order for the proposal to be adopted. Item 17 ‚Äì Proposal for a long-term incentive program  including hedging measures by way of a share swap agreement (LTI 2023/2025) Summary of the program The Annual General Meetings 2019  2020  2021 and 2022 resolved on long-term incentive programs for the CEO  other members of Group management and certain other key employees within the Securitas Group (together the ""LTI Programs""). The Board proposes that the AGM resolves to implement a long-term incentive program (""LTI 2023/2025"")  with the main principles below. LTI 2023/2025 is proposed to include approximately 90 employees including the CEO  other members of Group management and certain other key employees within the Securitas Group. In order to participate in the LTI 2023/2025  the participants will have to invest in Series B shares in Securitas at market price or nominate Series B shares already held  as further set out below. For every Series B share purchased or nominated within the scope of LTI 2023/2025  the company will award so called performance awards free of charge in accordance with the terms stipulated below. A change compared to previous LTI Programs is that the performance condition for LTI 2023/2025 is based on Securitas' operating margin  instead of the parameter earnings per share. This is in line with the new financial targets presented by Securitas in 2022  where a new operating margin target replaced the previous target of an increase in earnings per share. The rationale for the proposal The purpose of LTI 2023/2025 is to create a strong long-term incentive for top executives of the Group  strengthen the Group's ability to retain and recruit top executives  provide competitive remuneration  and to align the interests of the shareholders with the interests of the executives concerned by enabling the participants to become substantial shareholders in the company. Through a share-based incentive program  the employees' remuneration is tied to the company's future earnings and value growth. In light of the above  the Board believes that the implementation of LTI 2023/2025 will have a positive effect on the long-term value growth of the Group and consequently that LTI 2023/2025 is beneficial to both the shareholders and the company. Personally invested shares In order to participate in LTI 2023/2025  the participants will  with the exceptions stated below  during the period May 8  2023 ‚Äì June 8  2023 (the ""Investment Period"") have to either (i) purchase Series B shares in Securitas in the market and nominate such shares to LTI 2023/2025  (ii) nominate Series B shares currently vesting in LTI 2020/2022  or (iii) nominate shares nominated in LTI 2020/2022[1] (""Personally Invested Shares""). The value of a participant's Personally Invested Shares shall be based on the market price for the company's Series B share and shall correspond to minimum 5 percent (all participants) and maximum 15 percent (the CEO)  12.5 percent (other members of Group management) or 10 percent (other participants)  respectively  of the participant's base salary. If the participant has access to inside information and therefore is prevented from purchasing or nominating Personally Invested Shares during the Investment Period  the Board shall be entitled to extend or postpone the Investment Period in individual cases  but no later than to the next AGM. The Board shall further  in individual cases  be entitled to accept nomination of shares acquired prior to the Investment Period  but not earlier than January 1  2023  and/or acquired through e.g. a pension insurance as Personally Invested Shares  where the participant  in the Board's opinion  has valid reasons for nominating such shares to LTI 2023/2025. Participants in LTI 2023/2025 and allocation LTI 2023/2025 is proposed to include approximately 90 senior executives and key employees within the Securitas Group  divided in three categories. Category 1For each Personally Invested Share by the CEO of the Group under LTI 2023/2025  the company will award five performance awards to the CEO. Category 2For each Personally Invested Share by another member of Group management (currently thirteen individuals) under LTI 2023/2025  the relevant individual will be awarded four performance awards. Category 3For each Personally Invested Share by another participant under LTI 2023/2025  the relevant individual will be awarded three performance awards. Performance condition The number of Series B shares that the performance awards will entitle the participant to receive depends on the development of Securitas' operating margin[2]  compared to minimum and maximum target levels as defined by the Board  during the measurement period January 1  2023 ‚Äì December 31  2025. If the minimum level is not reached  the performance awards will entitle participants to receive zero Series B shares  whereas if the maximum level is reached  each performance award will entitle participants to receive one Series B share. If the outcome falls between the minimum level and the maximum level  participants' entitlement to Series B shares will be calculated linearly between zero and one Series B share per performance award. The Board intends to present the fulfilment of the performance-based condition in the Annual Report for the financial year 2025. Other conditions In addition to the above conditions  the following shall apply for the performance awards. The performance awards shall be awarded free of charge at the end of the Investment Period  subject to vesting.Each performance award entitles the holder to receive one Series B share free of charge (subject to the performance condition set out above) three years after allotment of the award (the ""Vesting Period"")  provided that the holder  with some exceptions  is still employed by the Securitas Group as per December 31  2025   and has maintained the full amount of Personally Invested Shares purchased or nominated under LTI 2023/2025 during the entire Vesting Period.  and has maintained the full amount of Personally Invested Shares purchased or nominated under LTI 2023/2025 during the entire Vesting Period. To make the participants' interest equal with the shareholders'  the company will compensate the participants for distributed dividend during the Vesting Period by increasing the number of Series B shares that each performance award may entitle the participant to receive after the Vesting Period.The number of Series B shares that each performance award may entitle the participant to receive may be subject to recalculation due to share issues  splits  reverse splits and similar dispositions.The performance awards are non-transferable and may not be pledged.The performance awards can be awarded by the company or any other company within the Group. Preparation and administration The Board shall be responsible for preparing the detailed terms and conditions of LTI 2023/2025 in accordance with the mentioned terms and guidelines. To this end  the Board shall be entitled to make adjustments to meet foreign regulations or market conditions. The Board may also make other adjustments if significant changes in the Securitas Group  or its operating environment  would result in a situation where the decided terms and conditions for LTI 2023/2025 no longer are appropriate. Such adjustments include a right for the Board to resolve on a reduction of the number of Series B shares that the performance awards would entitle a participant to receive  if the number of Series B shares that a participant would be entitled to ‚Äì considering Securitas' result and financial position  other circumstances regarding the Group's development and the conditions on the stock market ‚Äì would be clearly unreasonable. Furthermore  in the event that the Board considers that the delivery of shares under LTI 2023/2025 cannot be achieved at reasonable cost  with reasonable administrative efforts or due to specific market conditions  participants may instead be offered a cash settlement. Participation in LTI 2023/2025 also presumes that such participation is lawful and that such participation in Securitas' opinion can take place with reasonable administrative costs and economic efforts. The Board shall be entitled to implement an alternative incentive solution for employees in such countries where participation in LTI 2023/2025 is not advisable  which alternative solution shall  as far as practically possible  correspond to the terms of the LTI 2023/2025. Scope and cost of the program LTI 2023/2025 may  if the share price for the company's Series B share remains the same during the program's term  result in a maximum amount corresponding to 75 percent (CEO)  50 percent (other members of Group management) or 30 percent (other participants)  respectively  of the participants annual base salary (excluding social security costs). Such outcome is subject to the number of Personally Invested Shares being maximized  meaning that the value of the participant's Personally Invested Shares corresponds to 15 percent (the CEO)  12.5 percent (other members of Group management) or 10 percent (other participants)  respectively  of the participants annual base salary  that the participant maintains the full amount of Personally Invested Shares during the entire Vesting Period  and that the participant  with some exceptions  still is employed as per December 31  2025  and that the performance based condition has been fully achieved. The maximum number of Series B shares that a participant may nominate as Personally Invested Shares  and thus the total number of performance awards that may be allotted  shall be based on the market price for the company's Series B share. The total number of issued shares in the company amounts to 573 392 552 shares. Based on the assumption that the share price for the company's Series B share amounts to SEK 91  LTI 2023/2025 will  in accordance with the principles and assumptions set out above  comprise maximum 1 430 000 Series B shares in total  which corresponds to approximately 0.25 percent of the total number of issued shares in the company and 0.18 percent of the total number of votes in the company. The costs for LTI 2023/2025 should be expensed as personnel costs over the Vesting Period. Provided that the performance-based condition is fully achieved  the cost for LTI 2023/2025 before tax is  in accordance with the principles and assumptions set out above  estimated to approximately SEK 130 million  allocated over the Vesting Period. Estimated social security costs and financing costs are included in such amount. The Board proposes the AGM to resolve to authorize the Board to resolve on repurchase of shares in the company and to transfer such shares on a regulated market to cover social security costs and financing costs associated with LTI 2023/2025 (see separate item on the agenda). The costs for LTI 2023/2025 are expected to have marginal effect on key ratios of the Securitas Group. The Board deems that the positive effects on earnings that are expected to result from increased share ownership among senior management and key employees  which may be further increased through LTI 2023/2025  outweighs the costs related to LTI 2023/2025. All estimates are based on at each time applicable foreign exchange rates according to Reuters. Information on previous LTI Programs can be found in the Annual Report 2022  notes 9 and 12. Delivery of shares under LTI 2023/2025 and hedging measures To ensure the delivery of Series B shares under LTI 2023/2025  the company may enter into a share-swap agreement with a third party  whereby the third party in its own name shall acquire and transfer Series B shares in the company to employees participating in LTI 2023/2025. The cost for the swap is estimated at a maximum of SEK 600 000 assuming that the performance-based condition is fully achieved. Preparation of the proposal and voting majority LTI 2023/2025 has been initiated by the Board and the Remuneration Committee of Securitas in consultation with major shareholders and has been structured in consultation with external advisers based on an evaluation of previous incentive schemes. LTI 2023/2025 has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee and reviewed at meetings of the Board. The resolution must be supported by shareholders representing more than half of the votes cast  or  in case of equal voting  supported by the Chair of the AGM.

The Nomination Committee has been appointed in accordance with the principles previously decided by the 2020 Annual General Meeting. Item 1 - Election of Chairman for the Meeting The Nomination Committee proposes the election of Anders Moberg as Chairman of the Annual General Meeting. Item 9 - Resolution regarding the appropriation of the Company's profit in accordance with the adopted balance sheet The Board proposes that no dividend will be distributed for the financial year of 2022  and that the remaining profits be carried forward. Item 11 - Determination of the number of Board members  auditors and deputy auditors The Nomination Committee proposes that the number of Board members elected by the Annual General Meeting is six (seven according to the resolution from the AGM 2022). Furthermore  the Committee proposes one auditor with no deputy. Item 12 - Determination of fees for members of the Board of Directors and auditor The Nomination Committee proposes a fee of SEK 900 000 (875 000) to the Chairman of the Board and fees of SEK 360 000 (350 000) to each of the other Board members. For the Audit Committee  fees are proposed of SEK 180 000 (150 000) to the Chairman and SEK 80 000 (75 000) to each of the other two members. For the Remuneration Committee  fees are proposed of SEK 65 000 (65 000) to the Chairman and SEK 40 000 (40 000) to each of the other two members. Altogether  the Nomination Committee's proposal means that total remuneration to the Board  compared to the previous year  will decrease with SEK 235 000 to SEK 3 185 000. The Nomination Committee also proposes that fees to the auditor are paid against approved invoices. Item 13 - Election of Board members  Chairman of the Board and auditor The Nomination Committee proposes the re-election until the end of the next Annual General Meeting of the following Board members: Anders Moberg  Daniel M√ºhlbach  Gunilla Spongh  Lars Ljung√§lv  Andr√©as Elgaard and Catarina Fagerholm. Kjersti Hob√∏l has declined re- election. It is proposed that Anders Moberg be re-elected as Chairman of the Board. A presentation of all proposed Board members is available on the Company's website  www.byggmax.com. The Nomination Committee proposes  in accordance with the Audit Committee's recommendation  the re-election of the Company's current auditor  the registered accounting firm √ñhrlings PricewaterhouseCoopers AB  until the end of the next Annual General Meeting. √ñhrlings PricewaterhouseCoopers AB have notified that Authorized Public Accountant Cesar Mor√© will serve as the Auditor in Charge. Item 14 - Submission of remuneration report for approval The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to approve the remuneration report in accordance with Chapter 8  Section 53 of the Swedish Companies Act. Item 15 - Resolution regarding authorization of the Board of Directors to issue new shares  warrants and/or convertible instruments The Board of Directors proposes it be authorized to  with or without deviation from shareholders' preferential rights and on one or several occasions during the period until the next Annual General Meeting  resolve to increase the Company's share capital by issuing new shares  warrants or convertible instruments. The number of shares that such issues may comprise may be equivalent to a maximum of ten percent of the share capital of the Company at the time of the Annual General Meeting's resolution on the authorization. Any issues with deviation from shareholders' preferential rights shall be conducted under market conditions  subject to issue discounts in line with market practice  and payment may  apart from payment in cash  be made in kind or by set-off or otherwise be coupled with conditions pursuant to the Swedish Companies Act. Other conditions for issues pursuant to this authorization  including to whom an issue is directed  shall be left for the discretion of the Board of Directors. The purpose of the authorization and the reasons for any deviation from shareholders' preferential rights is to finance acquisitions or otherwise to capitalize the Company in a time- and cost-effective way. The Managing Director  or any person appointed by the Board of Directors  shall be authorized to make minor amendments to the Annual General Meeting's resolution and to take those measures that are required in connection with the registration of the resolution. A resolution in accordance with this proposal is valid only where supported by shareholders holding not less than two thirds of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the General Meeting. Item 16 - Resolution regarding authorization of the Board of Directors to resolve on acquisitions and transfers of own shares The Board of Directors proposes it be authorized to  on one or several occasions during the period until the next Annual General Meeting  resolve on acquisitions of own shares as follows: Acquisition may take place provided that the Company's holding does not at any time exceed five per cent of all shares in the Company. Acquisition may take place on Nasdaq Stockholm. Acquisitions on Nasdaq Stockholm may only occur at a price per share within the price interval registered at any given time  i.e. the interval between the highest bid price and the lowest selling price. Payment for the shares shall be made in cash. The Board further proposes it be authorized to  on one or several occasions during the period until the next Annual General Meeting  resolve on transfer of the Company's own shares as follows: All treasury shares held by the Company at any given time may be transferred. Transfer of own shares shall be made either on Nasdaq Stockholm or in another manner with deviation from shareholders' preferential rights. Transfer of shares on Nasdaq Stockholm may only occur at a price per share within the price interval registered at any given time  i.e. the interval between the highest bid price and the lowest selling price. Transfer of own shares in another manner shall be conducted under market conditions  subject to issue discounts in line with market practice. Payment for transferred shares may  apart from payment in cash  be made in kind or by set-off. The purpose of the authorization to acquire and transfer own shares is to provide the Board of Directors with greater freedom of action in relation to the Company's capital structure  and to make it possible for the Company to finance acquisitions with own shares. The possibility to deviate from the shareholders' preferential rights when transferring own shares is motivated by the fact that such a transfer can be done more rapidly and more cost efficient than by a transfer to the shareholders. If  in connection with an acquisition  the Company's own shares are transferred against compensation in any other form than cash  the Company cannot provide the shareholders the opportunity to exercise their preferential rights. A resolution in accordance with this item is valid only where supported by shareholders holding not less than two thirds of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the General Meeting. Item 17 - Resolution regarding incentive program  comprising a private placement and assignment of warrants The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolve on a long-term incentive program as follows  comprising the private placement of a new issue of warrants and the assignment of warrants. Background and motive The Board of Directors deems it important and in the interest of all shareholders that the employees of the Byggmax Group have a long-term interest in a favorable trend in the Company's share price. The Company has previously adopted warrants-based incentive programs at the 2019  2021 and 2022 Annual General Meetings. These programs are still outstanding (for additional information see the heading ""Outstanding and previous share- related incentive programs"" below). A warrants-based incentive program for the Byggmax Group's employees enables the reward of employees to be linked to the Company's future earnings and value trends. Long-term growth in value is thereby prioritized and the goals of shareholders and the employees concerned coincide. In addition  share-related incentive programs create a Group-wide focus for these employees and thus prioritize actions for the long-term. The incentive program is also assessed as facilitating the recruitment and retention of key employees by the Company. The Board of Directors therefore assesses  based on the design of the incentive program  that there is no need to establish any predetermined and measurable performance criteria for participation in the program. In light of the terms and conditions  the size of the allocation and other circumstances  the Board of Directors is of the opinion that the proposed incentive program  in accordance with the following  is both reasonable and advantageous for the Company and its shareholders. Allotment and general terms and conditions for the warrants A maximum issue of 580 000 warrants is proposed. The warrants are intended to be offered to employees at market rates in even lots of 1 000 warrants. Participants in the incentive program are divided into two categories. The Board of Directors of the Company should be empowered to decide on allocation of the warrants in accordance with the following guidelines: Category No. of participants in the category Guaranteed allocation of warrants per participant Managing Director 1 200 000 Other management 10 380 000 Total 11 580 000 The Company's current Managing Director Mattias Ankarberg will leave his role as Managing Director on August 9  2023  and shall therefore not be offered the opportunity to acquire warrants. The warrants above  which are intended for the Managing Director  may by the Attachments Original LinkOriginal DocumentPermalink Disclaimer Byggmax Group AB published this content on 31 March 2023 and is solely responsible for the information contained therein.

The board of directors' reasoned statement pursuant to pursuant to Chapter 18  section 4 of the Swedish Companies Act is available on the company's website  www.scandistandard.com. * * * Stockholm in March 2023 Scandi Standard AB (publ) The board of directors3 Item 14: Resolution on guidelines for remuneration to the senior management The board of directors proposes that the below guidelines for remuneration for the senior management are applied for remuneration agreed after the annual general meeting 2023. The difference compared to the remuneration guidelines that were adopted at the annual general meeting 2022 is that sustainability related goals have been added as an objective for variable salary. Remuneration resolved upon by the general meeting is not covered by these guidelines. General principles for the remuneration and other terms and conditions In these guidelines  the senior management means the managing director and CEO of the company  the senior managers in the company and other group companies who  from time to time  are reporting to the managing director and CEO or the CFO and who are also members of the senior management  as well as board members of the company that have entered into an employment or consulting agreement with a group company. The company's remuneration principles and policies shall be designed to ensure responsible and sustainable remuneration decisions that support the company's and the group's strategy  long-term interests and sustainable business practices. Salaries and other terms and conditions of employment in the company and the group shall be adequate to enable the company and the group to retain and recruit skilled senior managers at a reasonable cost. The remuneration to the senior managers shall consist of fixed salary  variable salary  pension and other benefits  and it shall be based on principles of performance  competitiveness and fairness. Principles for fixed salary Each senior manager shall be offered a fixed salary in line with market conditions and based on the manager's responsibility  expertise and performance. To the extent a board member performs work for the company  in addition to ordinary board work  a market-based consulting fee may be paid. Principles for variable salary All senior managers may  from time to time  be offered a variable salary (i.e.  cash bonuses). The variable salary shall be based on achieving a set of financial  sustainability related and/or personal objectives determined in advance. To which extent the objectives for awarding variable salary has been satisfied shall be determined when the relevant measurement period of the performance criteria has ended. The remuneration committee of the board of directors is responsible for the evaluation of the variable salary to the managing director and CEO. The managing4 director and CEO is responsible for the evaluation of the variable salary to other members of the senior management. The variable salary may not amount to more than 75 per cent of the fixed salary (in this context  fixed salary means cash salary earned during the year  excluding pension  benefits and similar). Principles for share-related incentive programs Remuneration resolved upon by the general meeting is not covered by these guidelines. Accordingly  these guidelines do not apply to the share-related long term incentive program 2023 (LTIP 2023) which the board of directors has proposed to the annual general meeting 2023 or the similar outstanding share- related long-term incentive programs resolved upon by the annual general meetings 2020  2021 and 2022  respectively. These share-relatedlong-term incentive programs are directed to certain key employees of the group and designed to promote the long-term value growth and sustainability of the company and to increase alignment between the interests of the participating employees and the company's shareholders. Under the incentive programs  the participating employees may be allotted shares in the company free of charge  subject to a three- year vesting period and provided that certain criteria are fulfilled. In order to further increase alignment between the long term interests of the participants and the company's shareholders  a requirement for participation is that the participant undertakes to retain all allotted shares (except for such shares that are sold to cover for tax due to the allotment of shares) for a period of two years from the date of the allotment of the shares. More information on the company's share-related long- term incentive programs  including the performance criteria which the outcome depends on  is available on company's website  www.scandistandard.com. Principles for pensions Agreements regarding pensions shall  where applicable  be premium based and designed in accordance with the level and practice applicable in the country in which the member of senior management is employed. Pension premiums for premium defined pension may not amount to more than 30 per cent of the annual fixed salary unless otherwise applies pursuant to applicable collective bargaining agreements. Principles for other non-monetary benefits Other non-monetary benefits may include  for example  life insurance  health insurance and car benefits. Premiums and other costs related to such benefits may not amount to more than 10 percent of the annual fixed salary.,neutral,0.04,0.96,0.0,neutral,0.03,0.95,0.01,True,English,"['Scandi Standard', 'complete proposals', 'board', 'similar outstanding share- related long-term incentive programs', 'share-related long term incentive program', 'three- year vesting period', 'share-related incentive programs', 'share-relatedlong-term incentive programs', 'long-term value growth', 'financial, sustainability related', 'sustainability related goals', 'relevant measurement period', 'Scandi Standard AB', 'Euroclear Sweden AB', 'Swedish Companies Act', 'sustainable business practices', 'annual general meetings', 'market-based consulting fee', 'sustainable remuneration decisions', 'skilled senior managers', 'other group companies', 'ordinary board work', 'long-term interests', 'consulting agreement', 'other terms', 'senior management', 'balance sheet', 'total amount', 'General principles', 'reasonable cost', 'cash bonuses', '75 per cent', 'key employees', 'participating employees', 'variable salary', 'fixed salary', 'cash salary', 'other members', 'record date', 'other benefits', 'Thursday 11 May', 'managing director', 'personal objectives', 'remuneration committee', 'board member', 'market conditions', ""directors' proposal"", 'performance criteria', 'remuneration principles', 'remuneration guidelines', 'group company', '4 director', 'proposals', 'items', 'Resolution', 'allocation', 'profit', 'loss', 'SEK', 'Monday', 'accordance', 'payment', 'shares', 'notice', 'change', 'statement', 'Chapter', 'section', 'website', 'Stockholm', 'March', '3 Item', 'difference', 'CEO', 'time', 'CFO', 'employment', 'policies', 'responsible', 'strategy', 'Salaries', 'pension', 'competitiveness', 'fairness', 'responsibility', 'expertise', 'extent', 'addition', 'set', 'advance', 'evaluation', 'context', 'LTIP', 'alignment', 'shareholders', 'charge', 'order']",2023-03-31,2023-04-01,marketscreener.com

Poll voting is in line with practice adopted by many UK public companies and provides a more transparent method of voting. It will result in a more accurate reflection of the views of shareholders by ensuring that every vote is recognised  including the votes of those shareholders who are unable to attend but who have appointed a proxy for the meeting. On a poll  each shareholder has one vote for every share held. I would encourage shareholders to exercise their right to vote; this will ensure that your vote will be counted if ultimately you (or any other proxy you might otherwise appoint) are not able to attend the meeting. Instructions for completing the Form of Proxy are outlined below. The valid appointment of a proxy does not prevent you from attending the AGM and voting in person.ACTION TO BE TAKENPlease complete and return the enclosed Form of Proxy so that it is received by the Company‚Äôs Registrar  Equiniti  by no later than 11 am on Tuesday  9 May 2023. If you are a member of CREST  you may submit a proxy appointment electronically through the CREST voting service.

The Board considers that the Resolutions are in the best interests of the Company‚Äôs shareholders as a whole and will promote the success of the Company for their benefit. The Directors intend to vote in favour of the Resolutions in respect of their own beneficial shareholdings in the Company (save in respect of those Resolutions in which they are interested).Should it become appropriate to revise the current arrangements for the AGM  any such changes will be notified to shareholders through our website (www.osb.co.uk) and  where appropriate  by an announcement made by the Company to a Regulatory Information Service.Yours faithfullyDavid WeymouthChairmanNOTICE OF ANNUAL GENERAL MEETINGNotice is hereby given that the Annual General Meeting of OSB GROUP PLC (the Company) will be held at 90 Whitfield Street  Fitzrovia  London W1T 4EZ on Thursday  11 May 2023 at 11 am to consider and  if thought fit  pass the following Resolutions.Resolutions 1 to 9 will be proposed as ordinary resolutions.

This Notice of AGM and the 2022 Annual Report and Accounts are available at www.osb.co.uk. For the purpose of this Notice  the issued share capital of the Company with voting rights on 23 March 2023  being the latest practicable date prior to the printing of this document  was 430 243 748 ordinary shares of ¬£0.01 each.RESOLUTION 1: 2022 Annual Report and Accounts (ordinary resolution)The Directors of the Company present the Directors‚Äô reports  the Auditor‚Äôs report and the audited financial statements of the Company for the financial year ended 31 December 2022 (the 2022 Annual Report and Accounts) to the AGM as required by the Companies Act 2006.The Company proposes an ordinary resolution to receive the 2022 Annual Report and Accounts and  accordingly  shareholders have the opportunity to raise any questions on those documents under this Resolution.RESOLUTION 2: Directors‚Äô Remuneration Report (excluding the Remuneration Policy) for the year ended 31 December 2022 (ordinary resolution)In accordance with the Companies Act 2006  shareholders are invited to approve the Directors‚Äô Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 December 2022. This consists of the Annual Statement from the Chair of the Group Remuneration and People Committee and the Annual Report on Remuneration  which may be found on pages 142 to 156 of the 2022 Annual Report and Accounts. It details the Directors‚Äô remuneration for the year ended 31 December 2022 and sets out the way in which the Company intends to implement the Directors‚Äô Remuneration Policy in 2023. The Auditor has audited those parts of the Directors‚Äô Remuneration Report required to be audited and its report can be found on pages 169 to 178 of the 2022 Annual Report and Accounts. For the purposes of this Resolution  the Directors‚Äô Remuneration Report does not include the Directors‚Äô Remuneration Policy. The vote on Resolution 2 is advisory only and the Directors‚Äô entitlement to remuneration is not conditional on it being passed.The Companies Act 2006 requires the Directors‚Äô Remuneration Policy to be put to shareholders for approval annually unless the approved policy remains unchanged  in which case it need only be put to shareholders for approval at least every three years. The Company is not proposing any changes to the Directors‚Äô Remuneration Policy that was approved at the Annual General Meeting in 2022.RESOLUTION 3: Final dividend (ordinary resolution)A final dividend of 21.8 pence per ordinary share has been recommended by the Board for the year ended 31 December 2022 and  if approved by shareholders  will be paid on 17 May 2023 to all shareholders on the register at the close of business on 24 March 2023.RESOLUTIONS 4 (a) to (h): Election and re-election of Directors (ordinary resolutions)Resolution 4(a) relates to the election of a Director. Kal Atwal is standing for election as an Independent Non-Executive Director having been appointed to the Board of Directors with effect from 7 February 2023.Resolutions 4(b) to (h) relate to the retirement and re-election of the Company‚Äôs Directors. The Company‚Äôs articles of association require each Director to retire at the AGM. This is in line with best practice recommendations of the Financial Reporting Council‚Äôs UK Corporate Governance Code.The Board has confirmed  following a performance review  that each of the Directors standing for re-election continues to be an effective member of the Board  to make a positive contribution and to demonstrate commitment to his or her role. The Board believes that the considerable and wide-ranging experience of the Directors will continue to be invaluable to the Company. The Board considers that Kal Atwal has and will continue to make a valuable contribution to the Board and that she has sufficient time to devote to the Company‚Äôs affairs. The appointment of Kal Atwal has been recommended by the Group Nomination and Governance Committee. The biographies of Directors can be found in the Appendix to this document and also on the Company‚Äôs website www.osb.co.uk.RESOLUTIONS 5 AND 6: Re-appointment and remuneration of the Auditor (ordinary resolutions)The Company is required to appoint an auditor at each general meeting at which accounts are laid before the Company  to hold office until the conclusion of the next such meeting. The Group Audit Committee has recommended to the Board  the re-appointment of Deloitte LLP as Auditor of the Company and  has confirmed to the Board that its recommendation is free from third party influence and that no restrictive contractual provisions have been imposed on the Company limiting the choice of auditor. Resolution 5 proposes the re-appointment of Deloitte LLP as the Auditor of the Company and Resolution 6 authorises the Group Audit Committee to agree the Auditor‚Äôs remuneration.RESOLUTION 7: Authority to make political donations (ordinary resolution)Section 368 of the Companies Act 2006 (the Act) prohibits companies from making political donations exceeding ¬£5 000 in aggregate in any 12-month period to (i) political parties  (ii) other political organisations and (iii) independent election candidates  and from incurring political expenditure  without shareholder approval. In line with the Group‚Äôs policy  neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries made any political donations nor incurred any political expenditure during 2022. It is not proposed or intended to alter this policy. However  some of the Group‚Äôs activities may potentially fall within the wide definitions of ‚Äòpolitical donation‚Äô or ‚Äòpolitical expenditure‚Äô in the Act and  without the necessary statutory authorisation  the Group‚Äôs ability to communicate its views effectively to political audiences and to relevant interest groups could be inhibited. Such activities may include briefings at receptions or conferences ‚Äì when the Group seeks to communicate its views on issues vital to its business interests ‚Äì including  for example  conferences of a party political nature or of special interest groups in specific areas.Accordingly  the Company believes that the authority contained in this Resolution is necessary to allow it and its subsidiaries to fund activities which it is in the interests of shareholders that the Company should support. Such authority will enable the Company and its subsidiaries to be sure that they do not  because of any uncertainty as to the bodies or the activities covered by the Companies Act 2006  unintentionally commit a technical breach of the statutes. Any political donation made or expenditure incurred under authority of this Resolution will be disclosed in next year‚Äôs Annual Report and Accounts.This authority replaces the similar authority given to the Directors at the Annual General Meeting in 2022 and will expire at close of business on 30 June 2024 or  if earlier  at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting of the Company to be held in 2024.RESOLUTION 8: Directors‚Äô authority to allot shares (ordinary resolution)The Directors currently have a general authority to allot new ordinary shares in the capital of the Company and to grant rights to subscribe for  or convert any securities into  shares. This authority is  however  due to expire at the AGM and the Board would like to renew it to provide the Directors with flexibility to allot new shares and grant rights up until the Company‚Äôs next AGM within the limits prescribed by The Investment Association.The Investment Association‚Äôs guidelines on Directors‚Äô authority to allot shares state that the Association‚Äôs members will regard as routine any proposal at a general meeting to seek a general authority to allot an amount up to two-thirds of the existing share capital  provided that any amount in excess of one-third of the existing share capital is applied to a fully pre-emptive offer (including an offer by way of a rights issue or open offer) only. Accordingly  if passed  this resolution will authorise the Directors to allot (or grant rights over) new shares in the Company: (i) under an open offer or in other situations (including a rights issue) up to an aggregate nominal amount of ¬£1 434 146.62 (representing approximately one-third of the Company‚Äôs issued ordinary share capital); and (ii) under a fully pre-emptive offer (including an offer by way of a rights issue or open offer) only  up to a further aggregate nominal amount of ¬£1 434 146.62 (representing approximately one-third of the Company‚Äôs issued ordinary share capital). In each case  the reference to the Company‚Äôs issued ordinary share capital is to the issued ordinary share capital as at 23 March 2023 (being the latest practicable date prior to publication of this document).If passed  this authority will expire at the close of business on 30 June 2024 or  if earlier  at the conclusion of the AGM to be held in 2024.The Directors have no present intention of exercising this authority  however  the Board considers it prudent to maintain the flexibility that it provides to enable the Directors to respond to any appropriate opportunities that may arise. The Company did not hold any shares in treasury as at 23 March 2023.RESOLUTION 9: Directors‚Äô authority to allot shares in relation to the issue of Regulatory Capital Convertible Instruments (ordinary resolution)This Resolution renews the Directors‚Äô authority to allot shares or grant rights to subscribe for or convert any security into ordinary shares up to an aggregate nominal amount of ¬£516 292.50  in connection with the issue of ‚ÄòRegulatory Capital Convertible Instruments‚Äô. Regulatory Capital Convertible Instruments are any securities to be issued by the Company or any member of the Group  or by a Company outside of the Group with the consent of the Company or a member of the Group and which are intended on issue to form all or part of a type or class of securities  the terms of which are eligible to meet any Regulatory Capital Requirements and which are:convertible into or exchangeable for ordinary shares of the Company; orissued together with share warrants relating to ordinary shares of the Company;and in each case  which grant to  or require  the holder of such security and/or its nominee a right or obligation (as applicable) to subscribe for such ordinary shares following a specified event relating to an actual or prospective adverse change in the capital position or viability of the Company  any member of the Group or the Group as a whole or any other event specified in the Regulatory Capital Requirements and otherwise on such terms as may be determined by the Directors of the Company or a Committee thereof upon issue.The Board believes it is in the best interests of the Company to have the flexibility to issue Regulatory Capital Convertible Instruments at any time and from time to time. The authority sought in this Resolution will be used as considered desirable to comply with or maintain compliance with such Regulatory Capital Requirements or targets applicable to the Company. Regulatory Capital Requirements are specified by the Prudential Regulation Authority or such other authority having primary supervisory authority with respect to the Company from time to time in relation to the margin of solvency  capital resources  capital  contingent capital or buffer capital of the Company  a member of the Group or the Group taken as a whole.The Company intends to seek to renew authority for the issuance of such Regulatory Capital Convertible Instruments on an annual basis.The amount of this authority is  in aggregate  equivalent to approximately 12 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company as at 23 March 2023 (being the latest practicable date before the publication of this document). No ordinary shares were held in treasury as at that date.Resolutions 9 and 12 are intended to provide the Directors with the flexibility to authorise the issue of Regulatory Capital Convertible Instruments which contain contractual debt to equity conversion features. The Resolutions are not intended to provide authority for any future UK statutory conversion requirements as may become part of UK national law in the future  for which such authority would not be required.The authority sought in Resolution 9 is separate and distinct from the authority sought in Resolution 8 which is the usual authority sought on an annual basis in line with guidance issued by The Investment Association. The authority sought in Resolution 9 will expire at the close of business on 30 June 2024 or  if earlier  at the conclusion of the AGM to be held in 2024.RESOLUTIONS 10 and 11: Disapplication of statutory pre-emption rights (special resolutions)Resolutions 10 and 11 are proposed as special resolutions which  if passed by shareholders  will enable the Directors to allot ordinary shares in the Company  and/or to sell any shares out of treasury  for cash  without first offering those shares to existing shareholders in proportion to their existing holdings.In November 2022  the Pre-Emption Group issued a revised Statement of Principles (the Revised Statement of Principles) which permits companies to seek authorities to issue equity securities for cash on a non-pre-emptive basis representing: (i) up to 10 per cent of a company‚Äôs issued ordinary share capital for use on an unrestricted basis (plus a further authority of up to 2 per cent of a company‚Äôs issued ordinary share capital to be used only for the purposes of making a follow-on offer of the kind contemplated by paragraph 3 of Section 2B of the Revised Statement of Principles); and (ii) up to an additional 10 per cent of a company‚Äôs issued ordinary share capital for use in connection with an acquisition or a specified capital investment  which is announced contemporaneously with the issue  or that has taken place in the preceding 12 month period and is disclosed in the announcement of the issue (plus a further authority of up to 2 per cent of a company‚Äôs issued ordinary share capital to be used only for the purposes of making a follow-on offer of the kind contemplated by paragraph 3 of Section 2B of the Revised Statement of Principles).Having considered the Revised Statement of Principles  the Board believes that the limits in the Company‚Äôs previous pre-emption disapplication authorities provide the Company with sufficient flexibility at this time. The Board will keep this matter under review and will consider whether to seek increased authorities up to the revised limits detailed in the Revised Statement of Principles in future years.Accordingly  the power set out in Resolution 10 would be limited to:allotments or sales in connection with pre-emptive offers and offers to holders of other equity securities if required by the rights of those securities  or as the Board otherwise considers necessary; andotherwise up to an aggregate nominal amount of ¬£215 121.87 (representing 21 512 187 ordinary shares and 5 per cent of the Company‚Äôs issued ordinary share capital as at 23 March 2023 (being the latest practicable date before the publication of this document).In addition  Resolution 11 is intended to give the Company flexibility to make non-pre-emptive issues of ordinary shares in connection with acquisitions and other capital investments as contemplated by the Revised Statement of Principles. The power under Resolution 11 is in addition to that proposed by Resolution 10 and would be limited to allotments or sales of up to aggregate nominal amount ¬£215 121.87 (representing 21 512 187 ordinary shares and 5 per cent of the Company‚Äôs issued ordinary share capital as at 23 March 2023 (being the latest practicable date before the publication of this document).If the Company makes a non-pre-emptive issue of ordinary shares for cash using the power conferred by Resolution 10 or Resolution 11 described above  the Directors confirm their intention to comply with the shareholder protections contained in Part 2B of the Revised Statement of Principles regarding how such an issue should be carried out.The authorities sought under Resolutions 10 and 11 will expire at close of business on 30 June 2024 or  if earlier  at the conclusion of the AGM to be held in 2024.RESOLUTION 12: Disapplication of statutory pre-emption rights in relation to the issue of Regulatory Capital Convertible Instruments (special resolution)Resolution 9 renews the Directors‚Äô authority to allot shares or grant rights to subscribe for or convert any security into ordinary shares up to an aggregate nominal amount of ¬£516 292.50 specifically in connection with the issue of Regulatory Capital Convertible Instruments. Resolution 12 proposes that the Directors be empowered to allot equity securities pursuant to that authority for cash  without first offering those equity securities to existing shareholders in proportion to their existing holdings. ¬£516 292.50 is equivalent to approximately 12 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company as at 23 March 2023 (being the latest practicable date before the publication of this document).Renewing this Resolution will permit the Company the flexibility necessary to allot equity securities pursuant to any proposal to issue Regulatory Capital Convertible Instruments and  by virtue of such disapplication  without the need to comply with the pre-emption requirements of the UK statutory regime. Together with Resolution 9  Resolution 12 is intended to provide the Directors with the flexibility to issue Regulatory Capital Convertible Instruments which may convert into ordinary shares.Conditional upon the passing of Resolutions 9 and 12  the Directors would not expect to make use of Resolutions 8 and 10 to issue Regulatory Capital Convertible Instruments  however  they may do so  to the extent permissible  if deemed appropriate in light of capital requirements  market conditions and/or high demand. Any exercise of the authorities in Resolutions 8 and 10 (if passed) would be separate from  and in addition to  the exercise of powers under Resolutions 9 and 12 and would have the effect of diluting the interests of ordinary shareholders.RESOLUTION 13: Authority to purchase own shares (special resolution)The authority limits the maximum number of shares that could be purchased to 43 024 375 (representing approximately 10 per cent of the Company‚Äôs issued ordinary share capital as at 23 March 2023) and sets minimum and maximum prices at which shares may be purchased.This authority replaces the similar authority given to the Directors at the Annual General Meeting in 2022 and will expire at the close of business on 30 June 2024 or  if earlier  at the conclusion of the AGM to be held in 2024. A listed company purchasing its own shares may hold those shares in treasury and make them available for re-sale as an alternative to cancelling them. Accordingly  if this Resolution is passed  the Company will have the option of holding  as treasury shares  any of its own shares that it purchases pursuant to the authority conferred.This would give the Company the ability to sell treasury shares quickly and cost-effectively and provide the Company with additional flexibility in the management of its capital base. No dividends are paid and no voting rights are attached to shares held in treasury. The Company did not hold any shares in treasury as at 23 March 2023 (being the latest practicable date before the publication of this document). As at that date  there were 2 137 904 options to subscribe for ordinary shares in the capital of the Company  representing 0.50 per cent of the Company‚Äôs issued ordinary share capital. If the full authority conferred by this Resolution were to be exercised in full  these options would represent 0.55 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company.On 16 March 2023  the Company announced its intention to commence an ordinary share repurchase programme pursuant to the authority granted at last year‚Äôs AGM  in order to return up to ¬£150 million to shareholders (the Share Repurchase Programme). The Share Repurchase Programme will help to deliver on the Company‚Äôs stated intention to deliver attractive and sustainable returns to shareholders across the cycle. It is the Company‚Äôs present intention for any repurchased ordinary shares to be cancelled and the Share Repurchase Programme is expected to complete by no later than 15 March 2024.The Directors regard having the flexibility to repurchase issued shares in suitable circumstances as an important part of the financial management of the Company. The Directors may consider exercising the authority to purchase the Company‚Äôs ordinary shares if market conditions and the Company‚Äôs financial position make this possible but will keep the matter under review. Shares would only be purchased if the Directors believed that to do so would result in an improvement in earnings per share and would be in the interests of shareholders generally. Any purchases of ordinary shares would be by means of market purchases on a recognised investment exchange and purchased shares would be cancelled (in which case the number of shares in issue would thereby be reduced) or  alternatively  held in treasury  depending on which course of action is considered by the Directors to be in the best interests of the shareholders at that time.RESOLUTION 14: Notice of general meetings (special resolution)The statutory notice period required for general meetings of the Company is at least 21 clear days unless shareholders approve a shorter notice period  which cannot  however  be less than 14 clear days (AGMs will continue to be held on at least 21 clear days‚Äô notice). At last year‚Äôs AGM  shareholders passed a resolution enabling the Company to call general meetings  other than an AGM  on at least 14 clear days‚Äô notice. This approval must be renewed at each AGM  so  in order to preserve this ability  Resolution 14 seeks such approval.It is intended that the shorter notice period would not be used as a matter of routine for such meetings but only where the flexibility is merited by the business of the meeting and is thought to be in the interests of shareholders as a whole. If given  the approval will be effective until the Company‚Äôs next AGM  when it is intended that a similar resolution will be proposed.NOTES1. The Company strongly encourages all shareholders to submit a proxy vote in advance of the AGM  appointing the Chairman of the meeting as their proxy rather than a named person. These notes to the Notice should be read in this context.2. Only persons entered on the Register of Members of the Company at 6.30 pm on Tuesday  9 May 2023 (or  if the AGM is adjourned  at 6.30 pm on the date which is two business days prior to the adjourned meeting) shall be entitled to attend and vote at the AGM oradjourned meeting. Changes to entries on the Register of Members after this time shall be disregarded in determining the rights of persons to attend or vote (and the number of votes they may cast) at the AGM or adjourned meeting.3. A shareholder entitled to attend and vote at the AGM may appoint another person as her/his proxy to exercise all or any of her/his rights to attend  speak and vote at the AGM. A shareholder can appoint more than one proxy in relation to the AGM  provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share or shares held by that shareholder.4. A proxy does not need to be a shareholder of the Company but must attend the AGM to represent you. Your proxy could be the Chairman or another person who has agreed to attend to represent you. If you wish for a proxy to make any comments on your behalf at the AGM  you will need to appoint someone other than the Chairman of the meeting and give them the relevant instructions directly. Those submitting a Form of Proxy are strongly encouraged to appoint the Chairman of the meeting rather than a named person as their proxy. This will ensure that your vote will be counted even if ultimately you (or any other proxy you might otherwise appoint) are not able to attend the meeting. The valid appointment of a proxy does not prevent you from attending the AGM and voting in person.5. A shareholder who wishes to appoint a proxy should complete the Form of Proxy which accompanies this notice and includes full details of how to appoint a proxy. If you do not have a Form of Proxy and believe that you should have one  or if you require additional Forms of Proxy  please contact Equiniti‚Äôs helpline on 0371 384 2701 (+44 (0) 371 384 2701 if calling from overseas). Lines are open between 8.30 am and 5.30 pm Monday to Friday (excluding public holidays in England and Wales). Shareholders who hold their shares in uncertificated form may use ‚Äòthe CREST voting service‚Äô to appoint a proxy electronically  as explained below.6. In order to be valid  a proxy appointment must be returned (together with any power of attorney or other authority under which it is executed or a copy of the authority certified in ink by a bank  a stockbroker or a solicitor) by one of the following methods:‚Äì in hard copy form by post  by courier or by hand to the Company‚Äôs registrar at the address shown on the Form of Proxy; or in the case of CREST members  by utilising the CREST voting service in accordance with the procedures set out in note 9 below.The appointment of a proxy in each case must formally be received by the Company‚Äôs registrar no later than 11 am on Tuesday  9 May 2023.You may also appoint your proxy electronically online at www.sharevote.co.uk where full instructions on the procedure are given. The Voting ID  Task ID and Shareholder Reference Number printed on the Form of Proxy will be required to use this electronic proxy appointment system. Alternatively  shareholders who have already registered with Equiniti Registrars‚Äô online portfolio service  Shareview  can appoint their proxy electronically by logging on to their portfolio at www.shareview.co.uk using their user ID and password. Once logged in  click ‚Äòview‚Äô on the ‚ÄòMy Investments‚Äô page. Click on the link to vote and follow the on screen instructions.7. To change your proxy instructions you may return a new proxy appointment using the methods set out above. Where you have appointed a proxy using the hard copy Form of Proxy and would like to change the instructions using another hard copy Form of Proxy  please contact Equiniti at Aspect House  Spencer Road  Lancing  West Sussex BN99 8LU. The deadline for receipt of proxy appointments (see above) also applies in relation to amended instructions. Any attempt to terminate or amend a proxy appointment received after the relevant deadline will be disregarded. Where two or more valid but differing appointments of proxy are delivered or (in the case of appointments in electronic form) received in respect of the same share for use at the same meeting  the one which is last delivered or  as the case may be  received as aforesaid (regardless of its date  its date of sending or the date of its execution) shall be treated as replacing and revoking the other or others as regards that share. If the Company is unable to determine either which is last sent or which is last delivered or received  none of them shall be treated as valid in respect of the relevant share(s).In the case of joint holders  where more than one of the joint holders purports to appoint a proxy  only the appointment submitted by the most senior holder will be accepted. Seniority is determined by the order in which the names of the joint holders appear in the Company‚Äôs register of members in respect of the joint holding (the first-named being the most senior).8. A copy of this notice has been sent for information only  to Nominated Persons (that is  a person who has been nominated by a shareholder to enjoy information rights under section 146 of the Companies Act 2006). The rights to appoint a proxy cannot be exercised by a Nominated Person; they can only be exercised by a shareholder. However  a Nominated Person may have a right under an agreement with the shareholder by whom she or he was nominated to be appointed as a proxy for the AGM or to have someone else so appointed. If a Nominated Person does not have such a right or does not wish to exercise it  she or he may have a right under such an agreement to give instructions to the shareholder as to the exercise of voting rights.9. CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies by utilising the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so by utilising the procedures described in the CREST Manual  which can be viewed at www.euroclear.com. CREST personal members or other CREST sponsored members  and those CREST members who have appointed a voting service provider(s)  should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s)  who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf. In order for a proxy appointment made by means of CREST to be valid  the appropriate CREST message (a CREST Proxy Instruction) must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear‚Äôs specifications and must contain the information required for such instructions  as described in the CREST Manual. The message  regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or an amendment to the instruction given to a previously appointed proxy must  in order to be valid  be transmitted so as to be received by the issuer‚Äôs agent (ID number RA19) by 11 am on Tuesday  9 May 2023 (the latest time(s) for receipt of proxy appointments specified in this notice). For this purpose  the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Applications Host) from which the issuer‚Äôs agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001.10. CREST members and  where applicable  their CREST sponsors or voting service providers should note that Euroclear does not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or  if the CREST member is a CREST personal member or sponsored member or has appointed a voting service provider(s)  to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection  CREST members and  where applicable  their CREST sponsors or voting service providers are referred  in particular  to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings.11. Voting on all Resolutions will be conducted by way of a poll rather than a show of hands. This is a more transparent method of voting as shareholders‚Äô votes (including the votes of those shareholders who are unable to attend but who have appointed a proxy for the meeting) are to be counted according to the number of shares held. As soon as practicable  following the AGM  the results of the voting will be announced via a Regulatory Information Service and also placed on the Company‚Äôs website: osb.co.uk/investors/shareholder-services/.12. Please note that the Company takes all reasonable precautions to ensure that no viruses are present in any electronic communication it sends out but the Company cannot accept responsibility for loss or damage arising from the opening or use of any email or attachments from the Company and recommends that shareholders subject all messages to virus checking procedures prior to use. Any electronic communication received by the Company  including the lodgment of an electronic proxy form  that is found to contain any virus will not be accepted.13. A shareholder of the Company  that is a corporation  may authorise a person or persons to act as its representative(s) at the AGM. In accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006  each such representative may exercise (on behalf of the corporation) the same powers as the corporation could exercise if it were an individual shareholder of the Company  provided that they do not do so in relation to the same shares.14. Shareholders satisfying the thresholds in section 527 of the Companies Act 2006 can require the Company to publish a statement on its website setting out any matter relating to the audit of the Company‚Äôs accounts (including the Auditor‚Äôs report and the conduct of the audit) that are to be laid before the AGM and that the shareholders propose to raise at the AGM. The Company may not require the shareholders requesting the publication to pay its expenses. Any statement placed on the website must also be sent to the Company‚Äôs Auditor no later than the time it makes its statement available on the website. The business which may be dealt with at the AGM includes any statement that the Company has been required to publish on its website.15. Under section 319A of the Companies Act 2006  the Company must  subject to limited exceptions  answer any question relating to the business being dealt with at the AGM which is put by a shareholder attending the AGM. Information relating to the AGM which the Company is required by the Companies Act 2006 to publish on a website in advance of the meeting may be viewed at osb.co.uk/investors/ shareholder-services/. You may not use any electronic address provided in this notice to communicate with the Company for any purposes other than those expressly stated.16. Shareholders have the right to ask questions in relation to the business of the AGM but no answer need be given if (a) to do so would interfere unduly with the preparation for the AGM or involve the disclosure of confidential information  (b) the answer has already been given on a website in the form of an answer to a question  or (c) it is undesirable in the interests of the Company or the good order of the AGM that the question be answered. Shareholders wishing to raise any questions relating to the business of the AGM may do so by submitting them to the Company Secretariat ahead of the AGM at company.secretariat@osb.co.uk. You may submit questions until 11 am on Tuesday  9 May 2023 and the Company will endeavour to publish and maintain an appropriate summary of responses on the ‚ÄòAGM Information‚Äô page of its website in advance of the AGM.17. Shareholders have the right to request  in accordance with section 360BA of the Companies Act 2006  information to enable them to determine that their vote on a poll was validly recorded and counted. Shareholders who wish to do so should contact Equiniti by phone on 0371 384 2701 (+44 (0) 371 384 2701 if calling from overseas) or by post at Aspect House  Spencer Road  Lancing  West Sussex BN99 8LU  in each case no later than 30 days following the date of this year‚Äôs AGM.18.

March 31  2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Bank of America Corporation (""BAC"") (NYSE: BAC)  BofA Finance LLC (""BofA Finance"") and certain other BAC-affiliated issuers have issued and outstanding certain floating or fixed-to-floating rate debt securities  preferred stock represented by depositary shares and trust preferred securities  listed in the Annexes to this press release  that are governed by New York or Delaware law  for which U.S. dollar LIBOR (""USD LIBOR"")  for one- or three-month tenors  serves as the benchmark rate used in connection with the calculation or determination of applicable interest  dividend or distribution payments (the ""USD LIBOR Securities""). On March 5  2021  the U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority announced that after June 30  2023  USD LIBOR for such tenors (along with other remaining tenors of USD LIBOR) would cease publication or no longer be representative. In connection with the cessation of representative USD LIBOR  on March 15  2022  Congress enacted the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (the ""LIBOR Act"")  and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the ""Board"") has issued final rules thereunder (the ""LIBOR Rule"").BAC is issuing this press release to announce its expectation that  on the first London banking date after June 30  2023 (the ""LIBOR Replacement Date"")  the CME Term SOFR Reference Rate published for the one- or three-month tenor (that corresponds to the applicable USD LIBOR tenor)  as administered by CME Group Benchmark Administration  Ltd. (or any successor administrator thereof) (""CME Term SOFR"")  plus the applicable tenor spread adjustment described below (such rate being the ""Board-selected benchmark replacement"" under the LIBOR Rule) will be the reference rate for calculations or determinations of applicable interest  dividend or distribution payments for each of the USD LIBOR Securities listed in the Annexes to this press release. The replacement of USD LIBOR as the benchmark rate for each of the USD LIBOR Securities  with CME Term SOFR for the applicable corresponding tenor  plus the applicable tenor spread adjustment  will be effective for determinations under the terms of the USD LIBOR Securities that are made on and after the LIBOR Replacement Date  but will not affect any determinations made prior to the LIBOR Replacement Date.Non-Workable Contractual FallbacksThe USD LIBOR Securities listed in Annex 1 to this press release  contain fallback provisions that provide for (i) a poll or inquiries for quotes or information related to USD LIBOR or (ii) benchmark replacements based on USD LIBOR values (such as the most recently available USD LIBOR rate or USD LIBOR rate as determined by the calculation agent using discretion). Under the LIBOR Act and LIBOR Rule  on the LIBOR Replacement Date  by operation of law (i) these fallback provisions will be disregarded and deemed null and void and without any force or effect  and (ii) USD LIBOR will be replaced as the benchmark rate by CME Term SOFR for the tenor that corresponds to the applicable USD LIBOR tenor  plus the applicable tenor spread adjustment.Determining Person DiscretionThe USD LIBOR Securities listed in Annex 2 to this press release contain fallback provisions authorizing an investment bank of national or international standing  as applicable  to select the benchmark replacement rate for three-month USD LIBOR. Under the LIBOR Act and the LIBOR Rule  such investment bank is the person with the sole authority under the terms of these USD LIBOR Securities to determine a benchmark replacement for USD LIBOR (referred to in the LIBOR Act and LIBOR Rule as the ""determining person""). For each of these USD LIBOR Securities  BAC and BofA Finance  as issuers of such securities  have appointed BofA Securities  Inc. as the determining person  and it has selected three-month CME Term SOFR  plus the applicable tenor spread adjustment  as the benchmark replacement for three-month USD LIBOR on and after the LIBOR Replacement Date.ARRC Recommended Fallback ProvisionsThe USD LIBOR Securities listed in Annex 3 to this press release contain fallback provisions for three-month USD LIBOR substantially in the form recommended on April 25  2019 by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (""ARRC"") convened by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. For each of these USD LIBOR Securities  in accordance with these fallback provisions  it is expected that USD LIBOR will be replaced as the benchmark rate by CME Term SOFR for the applicable tenor  plus the applicable tenor spread adjustment  on and after the USD LIBOR Replacement Date  if BAC  as issuer  determines that a benchmark transition event and the related benchmark replacement date (as such terms are defined in such securities) have occurred and an interpolated rate (as such term is defined in such securities) cannot be determined. BAC  as issuer of these USD LIBOR Securities  expects these conditions to be satisfied on and after the LIBOR Replacement Date  such that three-month CME Term SOFR  plus the applicable tenor spread adjustment  will replace three-month USD LIBOR for each of these Annex 3 USD LIBOR Securities on and after the LIBOR Replacement Date in the same manner as described above for the Annex 1 and Annex 2 USD LIBOR Securities.Tenor Spread AdjustmentThe tenor spread adjustment for CME Term SOFR with respect to the following tenors of USD LIBOR  as set forth in the LIBOR Act and the LIBOR Rule  is:Tenor Tenor spread adjustment One Month 0.11448 % Three Months 0.26161 %Conforming ChangesFor the USD LIBOR Securities for which the Board-selected benchmark replacement becomes the benchmark replacement for USD LIBOR by operation of law under the LIBOR Act (the USD LIBOR Securities listed in Annex 1) or because selected as such by a determining person (the USD LIBOR Securities listed in Annex 2)  the LIBOR Rule provides that certain benchmark replacement conforming changes will become an integral part of such securities by operation of law. See Annex 4 for a description of such conforming changes. In addition  a person responsible for calculating or determining any valuation  payment or other measurement based on a benchmark (a ""calculating person"") has the authority under the LIBOR Act and the LIBOR Rule to make certain additional benchmark replacement conforming changes (in addition to those specified in LIBOR Rule) under securities such as the USD LIBOR Securities listed in Annex 1 and Annex 2 without any requirement to obtain consent from any other person. Any such additional changes that the applicable calculating person makes with respect to such USD LIBOR Securities will become an integral part of the applicable securities by operation of law and be the subject of a separate announcement on the Investors/Fixed Income portion of BAC's website.Under the terms of the USD LIBOR Securities listed in Annex 3  BAC  as issuer  will have the right to make benchmark replacement conforming changes. It is expected that BAC will determine that the benchmark replacement conforming changes adopted by the Board under the LIBOR Rule will also apply to such USD LIBOR Securities. If BAC makes any additional benchmark replacement conforming changes with respect to such USD LIBOR Securities  such additional changes will be the subject of a separate announcement on the Investors/Fixed Income portion of BAC's website.This press release applies only to the USD LIBOR Securities listed in the Annexes to this press release and does not relate to any other securities or other instruments. In advance of the LIBOR Replacement Date  further notices relating to CME Term SOFR as the benchmark replacement rate for USD LIBOR for the USD LIBOR Securities held through The Depository Trust Company (""DTC"") will be made pursuant to the DTC LIBOR Replacement Index Communication Tool.Forward-Looking StatementsCertain statements contained in this press release may constitute ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

(2) Any reference to a particular time of day for determining USD LIBOR (such as 11:00 a.m. London time) shall be replaced with the standard publication time for the applicable Board-selected benchmark replacement (inclusive of the relevant tenor spread adjustment)  as established by the relevant benchmark administrator. (3) Any provision of any USD LIBOR Securities requiring use of a combination (such as an average) of LIBOR values over a period of time that spans the LIBOR Replacement Date shall be modified to provide that the combination shall be calculated consistent with that contractual provision using (i) the USD LIBOR the applicable tenor for any date prior to the LIBOR Replacement Date and (ii) the applicable Board-selected benchmark replacement rate for any date on or following the LIBOR Replacement Date  respectively. (4) To the extent a Board-selected benchmark replacement is not available or published on a particular day indicated in the USD LIBOR Securities as the determination date  the most recently available publication of the Board-selected benchmark replacement will apply.View original content to download multimedia: https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bank-of-america-corporation-announces-cme-term-sofr-as-benchmark-replacement-rate-for-certain-outstanding-usd-libor-securities-after-june-30-2023-301787421.htmlSOURCE Bank of America Corporation",neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.42,0.19,0.39,True,English,"['Outstanding USD LIBOR Securities', 'CME Term SOFR', 'Benchmark Replacement Rate', 'America Corporation', 'Bank', 'Certain', 'June', 'CME Term SOFR Reference Rate', 'Alternative Reference Rates Committee', 'first London banking date', 'applicable tenor spread adjustment', 'CME Group Benchmark Administration', 'U.S. dollar LIBOR', 'three-month CME Term SOFR', 'applicable USD LIBOR tenor', 'related benchmark replacement date', 'The USD LIBOR Securities', 'floating rate debt securities', 'USD LIBOR Replacement Date', 'applicable corresponding tenor', 'applicable interest, dividend', 'Federal Reserve System', 'Non-Workable Contractual Fallbacks', 'representative USD LIBOR', 'USD LIBOR values', 'three-month USD LIBOR', 'Adjustable Interest Rate', 'Financial Conduct Authority', 'benchmark transition event', 'trust preferred securities', 'USD LIBOR rate', 'other BAC-affiliated issuers', 'other remaining tenors', 'Federal Reserve Bank', 'benchmark replacement rate', 'BofA Finance LLC', 'three-month tenor', 'Determining Person Discretion', 'benchmark rate', 'BofA Securities', 'U.K.', 'LIBOR) Act', 'LIBOR Act', 'LIBOR Rule', 'interpolated rate', 'preferred stock', 'benchmark replacements', 'sole authority', 'N.C.', 'America Corporation', 'depositary shares', 'press release', 'New York', 'distribution payments', 'final rules', 'successor administrator', 'fallback provisions', 'investment bank', 'international standing', 'Delaware law', 'calculation agent', 'March', 'PRNewswire', 'outstanding', 'Annexes', 'connection', 'determination', 'June', 'publication', 'cessation', 'Congress', 'Board', 'Governors', 'expectation', 'calculations', 'terms', 'poll', 'inquiries', 'quotes', 'information', 'operation', 'force', 'effect', 'Inc.', 'ARRC', 'April', 'accordance', 'conditions']",2023-03-31,2023-04-01,marketscreener.com

The board's proposal regarding authorization for the board to acquire and transfer own ordinary shares (item 15) The board proposes that the AGM authorizes the board to acquire and transfer own ordinary Stockholmshares according(""the Marketplace"")to the followingor. inAcquisitionaccordanceof withordinaryan offersharesto allmayshareholdersonly be madein theon NasdaqCompany or all holders of ordinary'shares. Acquisition may only be made of such number of ordinary shares that the Company s holding of shares at each time does not exceed 10 percent of all shares in the Company. Transfer of ordinary shares may be made in other ways than on the ' Marketplace  including a right to transfer ordinary shares with deviation from the shareholders preferential rights and that payment may be made in cash  in kind  by set-off or otherwise with conditions. A maximum of 10 percent of the total number of shares in the Company may be transferred. However  if  prior to the exercise of the authorization regarding transfer of own ordinary shares  the board has also exercised the authorization regarding new issue of ordinary shares (item 17 on the agenda)  the number of ordinary shares that may be transferred under this authorization shall be reduced by the corresponding number of ordinary shares issued pursuant to the issue authorization. The authorizations stated above may be utilized on one or several occasions up until the AGM 2024. Acquisition and transfer of ordinary shares on the Marketplace may only be made at a price within the registered price interval at the Marketplace. Transfer of shares in connection with acquisitions of businesses may be made at a market price estimated by the board. The purpose of the authorizations' above to acquire and transfer ordinary shares  including any deviation from the shareholders preferential rights in connection with transfer  is to continuously be able to adjust the capital structure of the Company to the capital needs of the Company  to enable financing  in whole or in part  in connection with acquisitions of businesses and for financing and/or securing delivery of ordinary shares in long-term incentive programs previously adopted by the AGM. If the authorization regarding' transfer of ordinary shares is used for transfers with deviation from the shareholders preferential rights  the board shall  in connection with' the authorization being exercised  publish the reasons for the deviation from the shareholders preferential rights. Resolution on this item on the agenda has to be supported by shareholders representing at least two-thirds of the votes cast as well as of all shares represented at the AGM. The board's proposal regarding guidelines for remuneration of senior executives (item 16) The board proposes - with amendment of the guidelines adopted at the AGM 2022 - that the AGM approves the following guidelines for remuneration of senior executives. Who the guidelines cover  and their applicability These guidelines for remuneration of senior executives cover the CEO and other members of group management. The guidelines should be applied to compensation agreed  and amendments to compensation previously agreed  after the guidelines have been adopted by the AGM 2023. Regarding employment terms in other legislatures than Sweden  the relevant adaptations should be made to comply with mandatory local regulation or practice  for the overall purpose of these guidelines to be met. These guidelines do not cover compensation resolved by the AGM. The board is entitled to temporarily depart from these guidelines wholly or partly if there are special reasons' for this in an individual case  and a departure is necessary to'serve the Company s long-term interests and sustainability  or to ensure the Company s profitability. If such departure occurs  this should be stated in the Remuneration Report at the following AGM. These guidelines apply to the period from the AGM 2023 until next AGM. Matters regarding departure from the guidelines should be subject to consultation by the Remuneration Committee  and decision by the board. The guidelines' promotion of the Company's business strategy  long-term interests  and sustainability' Enea s ambition is to be a global software company  with a strong and leading position in the markets that it addresses  with yearly sales growth  high profitability  and healthy cash flows. Organic growth is the foundation of the operations  and work is ongoing to develop  rationalize and optimize it. Strategic and complementary acquisitions will be continuously screened  and if considered to add value for customers and shareholders within a well-considered' risk level  Enea will attempt to execute such acquisitions. For more information on Enea s strategy and target  see www.enea.com. The board's opinion is that the Company's ability to attract  motivate and retain' high-performing staff and managers is critical for' a successful implementation of the Company s business strategy and protection of the Company s long-term interests  including sustainability. This entails the Company being able to offer competitive benefits packages. Total compensation should contain a variable component linked to the' individual performance of staff and managers  but that is also synchronized with the Company s profitability and long-term sustainability. Forms of compensation  etc. Remuneration and other employment terms of senior executives should be at market levels. Remuneration consists of basic salary  variable remuneration and pensions. Additionally - and independent of these guidelines - the general meeting is entitled to resolve on share or share price-based payments. Fixed basic salary The CEO and other senior executives shall be offered a fixed annual cash salary  at a level aimed at attracting and retaining'senior executives with such professional and personal skills as are required to promote Enea s results. As a starting point  the fixed salary shall be determined per calendar year and normally be reviewed annually. Short'-term incentive program (STI) Enea s STI program has three parts. Two of these parts relate to the Company achieving specific financial targets  while one is determined by the'achievement of individual targets. Most of the variable compensation is linked to the Company s financial targets  while the individual targets correspond to a smaller proportion of variable compensation. The criteria applied as regards the Company's financial targets are linked to long-term targets decided by the board at any given time  such as sales  EBIT and EBITDA. The criteria applying to the individual targets shall be decided prior to the end of the first quarter of the financial year ' that the compensation relates to  and shall be as specific as the criteria' relating to the Company s financial targets. The criteria are designed to promote the Company s business' strategy  long- term interests  as well as sustainability  and accordingly  the Company s long-term value creation. The outcome of compensation is subject to consultation by the Remuneration Committee and decided by the board for the CEO. For other senior executives  the outcome of compensation is consulted and decided by the Remuneration Committee. Payment' of compensation is executed as soon as possible after the board meeting where the Company s annual financial statement is approved for the vesting year. The Company is not entitled to reclaim this compensation.

There will be no guaranteed allocation in connection with an investment in additional Investment Shares. In case of over notification by the above persons covered by the allotment principles  the allotment shall be made as follows. First  allocation shall be made pro rata in relation to the number of additional invested Investment Shares. Secondarily  allocation shall be made through the drawing of lots executed by the board of directors.Delivery of shares under LTIP 2023To ensure delivery of shares under LTIP 2023  the board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to authorize the board of directors to resolve on issue of shares of series C and on repurchase of shares of series C and resolves on transfer of own shares of series B in accordance with item (b) below.Scope and costs of LTIP 2023LTIP 2023 will be accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2 which stipulates that the Rights should be recorded as non-cash personnel expenses during the period of LTIP 2023. The costs for LTIP 2023 is estimated to amount to approximately SEK 2.3 million  excluding social security costs  calculated in accordance with IFRS 2 based on the following assumptions: (i) that 135 000 Matching Rights and 677 500 Performance Shares are allotted  (ii) that the price of the company's share immediately before the start of LTIP 2023 amounts to SEK 8.00 per share (closing price on 22 March 2023)  (iii) an estimated annual turnover of personnel of 10 per cent and (iv) that the TSR during the Performance Period amounts to 75 per cent.The costs for social security charges are estimated to approximately SEK 1.7 million  based on the above assumptions and a social security tax rate of 31.42 per cent. Together with the IFRS 2 cost  this will result in estimated costs of SEK 4.0 million. In addition to what is set forth above  the costs for LTIP 2023 have been based on that LTIP 2023 comprises not more than 11 participants and that each participant exercises its maximum investment.Effects on key ratios and dilutionUpon maximum allotment of 135 500 Matching Shares  677 500 Performance Shares and provided that the hedging arrangements in accordance with item 20(b) below are adopted by the annual general meeting  835 000 shares of series B will be allotted to participants under LTIP 2023  including a buffer of 22 000 shares of series B for dividend compensations  meaning a dilution of approximately 1.50 per cent of the number of shares and votes in the company. In addition  LTIP 2023 comprises allotment of 135 500 Investment Shares to the participants at the volume weighted average share price during the five trading days immediately prior to the offer to each participant to acquire the Investment Shares  meaning a dilution of approximately 0.24 per cent of the number of shares and votes in the company. This is conditional upon the annual general meeting resolving to adopt the proposed hedging arrangements in accordance with item 20(b) below.Taking into account shares that may be issued in accordance with previously implemented incentive programs in the form of warrant programs in the company and in accordance with the share matching program proposed to the annual general meeting with respect to the maximum number of Matching Shares and Performance Shares  the maximal dilution effect is approximately 4.35 per cent.The costs are expected to have a limited effect on the company's key ratios.The rationale for the proposalThe rationale for LTIP 2023 is to create conditions for motivating and retaining competent employees of the Medivir group as well as for the alignment of the targets of the participants with those of the company  as well as to increase the motivation of meeting and exceeding the company's financial targets. LTIP 2023 has been designed based on the view that it is desirable that key employees within the Medivir group are shareholders in the company. Participation in LTIP 2023 requires a personal investment in Investment Shares.By offering an allotment of Rights which  inter alia  are based on performance conditions  the participants are rewarded for increased shareholder value. Further  LTIP 2023 rewards employees' continued loyalty and thereby the long-term value growth in the company. Against this background  the board of directors is of the opinion that the adoption of LTIP 2023 will have a positive effect on the Medivir group's future development and thus be beneficial for both the company and its shareholders.Preparation of the matterThe principles of LTIP 2023 have been prepared by the board of directors of the company. The board of directors has thereafter resolved to submit this proposal to the annual general meeting. Except for the officials who prepared the matter pursuant to instructions from the board of directors  no employee that may be included in the program has taken part in the drafting thereof.Other share related incentive programs etc.Except from the current proposal to adopt a share matching program and the previous warrant programs resolved upon at the annual general meetings 2020  2021 and 2022  the company has no outstanding share related incentive programs. It is the board of directors's intention that the program shall recur annually  albeit in varying sizes.Proposal regarding authorization for the board of directors to resolve on a directed share issue of shares of series C and to repurchase issued shares of series C as well as resolution on transfer of own shares of series B to participants in LTIP 2023 and in the market (item 20 (b))The resolutions under items 20 (b)(i) - (iii) are proposed to be conditional upon i) that the annual general meeting resolves in accordance with the board of directors' proposal in accordance with item 18 regarding the adoption of new articles of association  and ii) upon each other. It is therefore proposed that the resolutions under items 20 (b)(i) - (iii) are adopted jointly.Authorization for the board of directors to resolve on issue of shares of series C (item 20 (b)(i))The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to authorize the board of directors  during the period until the next annual general meeting  at one or several occasions  to increase the company's share capital by not more than SEK 485 250 by the issue of not more than 970 500 shares of series C  each with a quota value of SEK 0.50. With deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights  a participating third party shall be entitled to subscribe for the new shares of series C at a subscription price corresponding to the quota value of the shares. The purpose of the authorization and the reason for the deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights in connection with the issue of shares is to enable for participants in LTIP 2023 to acquire Investment Shares  ensure delivery of shares under LTIP 2023 as well as to cover any social costs and dividend compensations due to LTIP 2023.Authorization for the board of directors to resolve to repurchase own shares of series C (item 20 (b)(ii))The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to authorize the board of directors  during the period until the next annual general meeting  at one or several occasions  to repurchase shares of series C. The repurchase may only be effected through a public offer directed to all holders of shares of series C and shall comprise all outstanding shares of series C. The purchase may be effected at a purchase price corresponding to the quota value of the share. Payment for the shares of series C shall be made in cash. The purpose of the proposed repurchase authorization is to enable for participants in LTIP 2023 to acquire Investment Shares  ensure delivery of shares under LTIP 2023 as well as to cover any social costs due to LTIP 2023.Resolution on the transfer of own shares of series B (item 20 (b)(iii))The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves that 835 000 shares of series C that the company purchases by virtue of the authorization to repurchase shares of series C in accordance with item 20 (b)(ii) above  following reclassification into shares of series B  may be transferred free of charge to participants in LTIP 2023 in accordance with resolved conditions and transferred to cover any social costs due to LTIP 2023.The board of directors thus proposes that the annual general meeting resolves that a maximum of 981 913 shares of series B held by the company  including such shares of series B that the company holds after previously completed repurchases  may be transferred to participants in accordance with the terms of LTIP 2023  and that it may be transferred on Nasdaq Stockholm  including through a financial intermediary  at a price within the price range registered at the time  to cover any social security contributions in accordance with the terms of LTIP 2023. The number of shares that can be transferred is subject to recalculation as a result of an in-between bonus issue  share split  share split  rights issue and/or similar events.The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves that 135 000 of the shares of series C that the company purchases by virtue of the authorization to repurchase shares of series C in accordance with item 20 (b)(ii) above  following reclassification into shares of series B  may be transferred to employees in Medivir to enable for acquisitions of Investment Shares for participation in LTIP 2023. The board of directors therefore proposes that a maximum of 135 500 shares of series B may be transferred to employees of Medivir. The transfer price shall amount to the volume weighted average share price during the five trading days immediately prior to the date of the offer to each participant to acquire Investment Shares.Majority requirementsA decision according to the proposal pursuant to item 18 and 19 above is valid only when supported by shareholders holding not less than two-thirds (2/3) of both the votes cast and of the shares represented at the annual general meeting.

The record date for the first payment is proposed to be May 8  2023  and for the second payment November 20  2023. If the AGM so resolves  the first payment is expected to be distributed by Euroclear Sweden AB starting May 11  2023  and the second payment starting November 23  2023. The Board has presented a motivated statement pursuant to Chapter 18  Section 4 of the Swedish Companies Act.Item 16 ‚Äì Proposal for resolution on authorization of the Board to resolve on acquisition and transfer of the company's own sharesThe Board proposes that the AGM authorizes the Board to resolve upon acquisition of the company's own shares of Series B according to the following terms: (i) acquisition of shares may take place on Nasdaq Stockholm  (ii) acquisition of shares may take place on one or several occasions during the time up to the AGM 2024  (iii) acquisition of shares may only be made so that the shares held by the company at any point in time does not exceed ten (10) percent of all shares in the company  (iv) acquisition of shares shall be made at a price which falls within the prevailing price interval registered at each point in time  meaning the interval between the highest purchase price and the lowest selling price  (v) payment for acquired shares shall be made in cash  and (vi) the Board should be authorized to decide upon any additional terms for the acquisition.Furthermore  the Board proposes that the AGM authorizes the Board to resolve upon transfer of the company's own shares of Series B according to the following terms: (i) transfer of shares may take place on Nasdaq Stockholm or in connection with acquisition of companies or businesses  on market terms  (ii) transfer of shares may take place on one or several occasions during the time up to the AGM 2024  (iii) the maximum number of shares to be transferred may not exceed the number of shares held by the company at the time of the Board's resolution  (iv) transfer of shares shall be made at a price which falls within the prevailing price interval registered at each point in time  meaning the interval between the highest purchase price and the lowest selling price  (v) payment for transferred shares may be made in other forms than cash  and (vi) the Board should be authorized to decide upon any additional terms for the transfer. The authorization includes the right to resolve on deviation of the preferential rights of shareholders.The purpose of the proposed authorizations is to (a) allow the Board to adjust the company's capital structure  to contribute to shareholder value  (b) be able to exploit attractive acquisition opportunities by fully or partly financing future acquisitions with the company's own shares  and (c) ensure the company's undertakings in respect of share-related or share-based incentive programs (other than delivery of shares to participants of incentive programs)  including covering social security costs. If the Board decides to adjust the company's capital structure in accordance with (a) above  the Board intends to propose that the company's share capital shall be decreased through share reduction of the repurchased shares.The Board has presented a motivated statement pursuant to Chapter 19  Section 22 of the Swedish Companies Act.A decision by the AGM on the proposal according to this item must be supported by shareholders representing at least two thirds of the votes cast as well as the shares present at the AGM in order for the proposal to be adopted.Item 17 ‚Äì Proposal for a long-term incentive program  including hedging measures by way of a share swap agreement (LTI 2023/2025)Summary of the programThe Annual General Meetings 2019  2020  2021 and 2022 resolved on long-term incentive programs for the CEO  other members of Group management and certain other key employees within the Securitas Group (together the ""LTI Programs""). The Board proposes that the AGM resolves to implement a long-term incentive program (""LTI 2023/2025"")  with the main principles below.LTI 2023/2025 is proposed to include approximately 90 employees including the CEO  other members of Group management and certain other key employees within the Securitas Group. In order to participate in the LTI 2023/2025  the participants will have to invest in Series B shares in Securitas at market price or nominate Series B shares already held  as further set out below. For every Series B share purchased or nominated within the scope of LTI 2023/2025  the company will award so called performance awards free of charge in accordance with the terms stipulated below.A change compared to previous LTI Programs is that the performance condition for LTI 2023/2025 is based on Securitas' operating margin  instead of the parameter earnings per share. This is in line with the new financial targets presented by Securitas in 2022  where a new operating margin target replaced the previous target of an increase in earnings per share.The rationale for the proposalThe purpose of LTI 2023/2025 is to create a strong long-term incentive for top executives of the Group  strengthen the Group's ability to retain and recruit top executives  provide competitive remuneration  and to align the interests of the shareholders with the interests of the executives concerned by enabling the participants to become substantial shareholders in the company. Through a share-based incentive program  the employees' remuneration is tied to the company's future earnings and value growth. In light of the above  the Board believes that the implementation of LTI 2023/2025 will have a positive effect on the long-term value growth of the Group and consequently that LTI 2023/2025 is beneficial to both the shareholders and the company.Personally invested sharesIn order to participate in LTI 2023/2025  the participants will  with the exceptions stated below  during the period May 8  2023 ‚Äì June 8  2023 (the ""Investment Period"") have to either (i) purchase Series B shares in Securitas in the market and nominate such shares to LTI 2023/2025  (ii) nominate Series B shares currently vesting in LTI 2020/2022  or (iii) nominate shares nominated in LTI 2020/2022[1] (""Personally Invested Shares"").The value of a participant's Personally Invested Shares shall be based on the market price for the company's Series B share and shall correspond to minimum 5 percent (all participants) and maximum 15 percent (the CEO)  12.5 percent (other members of Group management) or 10 percent (other participants)  respectively  of the participant's base salary.If the participant has access to inside information and therefore is prevented from purchasing or nominating Personally Invested Shares during the Investment Period  the Board shall be entitled to extend or postpone the Investment Period in individual cases  but no later than to the next AGM. The Board shall further  in individual cases  be entitled to accept nomination of shares acquired prior to the Investment Period  but not earlier than January 1  2023  and/or acquired through e.g. a pension insurance as Personally Invested Shares  where the participant  in the Board's opinion  has valid reasons for nominating such shares to LTI 2023/2025.Participants in LTI 2023/2025 and allocationLTI 2023/2025 is proposed to include approximately 90 senior executives and key employees within the Securitas Group  divided in three categories.Category 1For each Personally Invested Share by the CEO of the Group under LTI 2023/2025  the company will award five performance awards to the CEO.Category 2For each Personally Invested Share by another member of Group management (currently thirteen individuals) under LTI 2023/2025  the relevant individual will be awarded four performance awards.Category 3For each Personally Invested Share by another participant under LTI 2023/2025  the relevant individual will be awarded three performance awards.Performance conditionThe number of Series B shares that the performance awards will entitle the participant to receive depends on the development of Securitas' operating margin[2]  compared to minimum and maximum target levels as defined by the Board  during the measurement period January 1  2023 ‚Äì December 31  2025.If the minimum level is not reached  the performance awards will entitle participants to receive zero Series B shares  whereas if the maximum level is reached  each performance award will entitle participants to receive one Series B share. If the outcome falls between the minimum level and the maximum level  participants' entitlement to Series B shares will be calculated linearly between zero and one Series B share per performance award. The Board intends to present the fulfilment of the performance-based condition in the Annual Report for the financial year 2025.Other conditionsIn addition to the above conditions  the following shall apply for the performance awards.The performance awards shall be awarded free of charge at the end of the Investment Period  subject to vesting.Each performance award entitles the holder to receive one Series B share free of charge (subject to the performance condition set out above) three years after allotment of the award (the ""Vesting Period"")  provided that the holder  with some exceptions  is still employed by the Securitas Group as per December 31  2025   and has maintained the full amount of Personally Invested Shares purchased or nominated under LTI 2023/2025 during the entire Vesting Period.  and has maintained the full amount of Personally Invested Shares purchased or nominated under LTI 2023/2025 during the entire Vesting Period. To make the participants' interest equal with the shareholders'  the company will compensate the participants for distributed dividend during the Vesting Period by increasing the number of Series B shares that each performance award may entitle the participant to receive after the Vesting Period.The number of Series B shares that each performance award may entitle the participant to receive may be subject to recalculation due to share issues  splits  reverse splits and similar dispositions.The performance awards are non-transferable and may not be pledged.The performance awards can be awarded by the company or any other company within the Group.Preparation and administrationThe Board shall be responsible for preparing the detailed terms and conditions of LTI 2023/2025 in accordance with the mentioned terms and guidelines. To this end  the Board shall be entitled to make adjustments to meet foreign regulations or market conditions. The Board may also make other adjustments if significant changes in the Securitas Group  or its operating environment  would result in a situation where the decided terms and conditions for LTI 2023/2025 no longer are appropriate. Such adjustments include a right for the Board to resolve on a reduction of the number of Series B shares that the performance awards would entitle a participant to receive  if the number of Series B shares that a participant would be entitled to ‚Äì considering Securitas' result and financial position  other circumstances regarding the Group's development and the conditions on the stock market ‚Äì would be clearly unreasonable.Furthermore  in the event that the Board considers that the delivery of shares under LTI 2023/2025 cannot be achieved at reasonable cost  with reasonable administrative efforts or due to specific market conditions  participants may instead be offered a cash settlement.Participation in LTI 2023/2025 also presumes that such participation is lawful and that such participation in Securitas' opinion can take place with reasonable administrative costs and economic efforts. The Board shall be entitled to implement an alternative incentive solution for employees in such countries where participation in LTI 2023/2025 is not advisable  which alternative solution shall  as far as practically possible  correspond to the terms of the LTI 2023/2025.Scope and cost of the programLTI 2023/2025 may  if the share price for the company's Series B share remains the same during the program's term  result in a maximum amount corresponding to 75 percent (CEO)  50 percent (other members of Group management) or 30 percent (other participants)  respectively  of the participants annual base salary (excluding social security costs). Such outcome is subject to the number of Personally Invested Shares being maximized  meaning that the value of the participant's Personally Invested Shares corresponds to 15 percent (the CEO)  12.5 percent (other members of Group management) or 10 percent (other participants)  respectively  of the participants annual base salary  that the participant maintains the full amount of Personally Invested Shares during the entire Vesting Period  and that the participant  with some exceptions  still is employed as per December 31  2025  and that the performance based condition has been fully achieved.The maximum number of Series B shares that a participant may nominate as Personally Invested Shares  and thus the total number of performance awards that may be allotted  shall be based on the market price for the company's Series B share. The total number of issued shares in the company amounts to 573 392 552 shares.Based on the assumption that the share price for the company's Series B share amounts to SEK 91  LTI 2023/2025 will  in accordance with the principles and assumptions set out above  comprise maximum 1 430 000 Series B shares in total  which corresponds to approximately 0.25 percent of the total number of issued shares in the company and 0.18 percent of the total number of votes in the company.The costs for LTI 2023/2025 should be expensed as personnel costs over the Vesting Period. Provided that the performance-based condition is fully achieved  the cost for LTI 2023/2025 before tax is  in accordance with the principles and assumptions set out above  estimated to approximately SEK 130 million  allocated over the Vesting Period. Estimated social security costs and financing costs are included in such amount.The Board proposes the AGM to resolve to authorize the Board to resolve on repurchase of shares in the company and to transfer such shares on a regulated market to cover social security costs and financing costs associated with LTI 2023/2025 (see separate item on the agenda).The costs for LTI 2023/2025 are expected to have marginal effect on key ratios of the Securitas Group.The Board deems that the positive effects on earnings that are expected to result from increased share ownership among senior management and key employees  which may be further increased through LTI 2023/2025  outweighs the costs related to LTI 2023/2025.All estimates are based on at each time applicable foreign exchange rates according to Reuters. Information on previous LTI Programs can be found in the Annual Report 2022  notes 9 and 12.Delivery of shares under LTI 2023/2025 and hedging measuresTo ensure the delivery of Series B shares under LTI 2023/2025  the company may enter into a share-swap agreement with a third party  whereby the third party in its own name shall acquire and transfer Series B shares in the company to employees participating in LTI 2023/2025. The cost for the swap is estimated at a maximum of SEK 600 000 assuming that the performance-based condition is fully achieved.Preparation of the proposal and voting majorityLTI 2023/2025 has been initiated by the Board and the Remuneration Committee of Securitas in consultation with major shareholders and has been structured in consultation with external advisers based on an evaluation of previous incentive schemes. LTI 2023/2025 has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee and reviewed at meetings of the Board. The resolution must be supported by shareholders representing more than half of the votes cast  or  in case of equal voting  supported by the Chair of the AGM.Other informationAvailable documentation etc.The Annual Report and the Auditor's Report  the remuneration report and all other supporting documentation for the AGM are available at the company and on the company website www.securitas.com/agm2023 no later than three weeks before the AGM.The Nomination Committee's complete proposals and motivated statement are available at the company and on the company website www.securitas.com/agm2023.In addition  copies of the documentation will be sent to the shareholders who so request  indicating their mailing address.

March 31  2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Bank of America Corporation (""BAC"") (NYSE: BAC)  BofA Finance LLC (""BofA Finance"") and certain other BAC-affiliated issuers have issued and outstanding certain floating or fixed-to-floating rate debt securities ‚Ä¶","CHARLOTTE  N.C.  March 31  2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Bank of America Corporation (""BAC"") (NYSE: BAC)  BofA Finance LLC (""BofA Finance"") and certain other BAC-affiliated issuers have issued and outstanding certain floating or fixed-to-floating rate debt securities  preferred stock represented by depositary shares and trust preferred securities  listed in the Annexes to this press release  that are governed by New York or Delaware law  for which U.S. dollar LIBOR (""USD LIBOR"")  for one- or three-month tenors  serves as the benchmark rate used in connection with the calculation or determination of applicable interest  dividend or distribution payments (the ""USD LIBOR Securities""). On March 5  2021  the U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority announced that after June 30  2023  USD LIBOR for such tenors (along with other remaining tenors of USD LIBOR) would cease publication or no longer be representative. In connection with the cessation of representative USD LIBOR  on March 15  2022  Congress enacted the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (the ""LIBOR Act"")  and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the ""Board"") has issued final rules thereunder (the ""LIBOR Rule"").BAC is issuing this press release to announce its expectation that  on the first London banking date after June 30  2023 (the ""LIBOR Replacement Date"")  the CME Term SOFR Reference Rate published for the one- or three-month tenor (that corresponds to the applicable USD LIBOR tenor)  as administered by CME Group Benchmark Administration  Ltd. (or any successor administrator thereof) (""CME Term SOFR"")  plus the applicable tenor spread adjustment described below (such rate being the ""Board-selected benchmark replacement"" under the LIBOR Rule) will be the reference rate for calculations or determinations of applicable interest  dividend or distribution payments for each of the USD LIBOR Securities listed in the Annexes to this press release. The replacement of USD LIBOR as the benchmark rate for each of the USD LIBOR Securities  with CME Term SOFR for the applicable corresponding tenor  plus the applicable tenor spread adjustment  will be effective for determinations under the terms of the USD LIBOR Securities that are made on and after the LIBOR Replacement Date  but will not affect any determinations made prior to the LIBOR Replacement Date.Non-Workable Contractual FallbacksThe USD LIBOR Securities listed in Annex 1 to this press release  contain fallback provisions that provide for (i) a poll or inquiries for quotes or information related to USD LIBOR or (ii) benchmark replacements based on USD LIBOR values (such as the most recently available USD LIBOR rate or USD LIBOR rate as determined by the calculation agent using discretion). Under the LIBOR Act and LIBOR Rule  on the LIBOR Replacement Date  by operation of law (i) these fallback provisions will be disregarded and deemed null and void and without any force or effect  and (ii) USD LIBOR will be replaced as the benchmark rate by CME Term SOFR for the tenor that corresponds to the applicable USD LIBOR tenor  plus the applicable tenor spread adjustment.Determining Person DiscretionThe USD LIBOR Securities listed in Annex 2 to this press release contain fallback provisions authorizing an investment bank of national or international standing  as applicable  to select the benchmark replacement rate for three-month USD LIBOR. Under the LIBOR Act and the LIBOR Rule  such investment bank is the person with the sole authority under the terms of these USD LIBOR Securities to determine a benchmark replacement for USD LIBOR (referred to in the LIBOR Act and LIBOR Rule as the ""determining person""). For each of these USD LIBOR Securities  BAC and BofA Finance  as issuers of such securities  have appointed BofA Securities  Inc. as the determining person  and it has selected three-month CME Term SOFR  plus the applicable tenor spread adjustment  as the benchmark replacement for three-month USD LIBOR on and after the LIBOR Replacement Date.ARRC Recommended Fallback ProvisionsThe USD LIBOR Securities listed in Annex 3 to this press release contain fallback provisions for three-month USD LIBOR substantially in the form recommended on April 25  2019 by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (""ARRC"") convened by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. For each of these USD LIBOR Securities  in accordance with these fallback provisions  it is expected that USD LIBOR will be replaced as the benchmark rate by CME Term SOFR for the applicable tenor  plus the applicable tenor spread adjustment  on and after the USD LIBOR Replacement Date  if BAC  as issuer  determines that a benchmark transition event and the related benchmark replacement date (as such terms are defined in such securities) have occurred and an interpolated rate (as such term is defined in such securities) cannot be determined. BAC  as issuer of these USD LIBOR Securities  expects these conditions to be satisfied on and after the LIBOR Replacement Date  such that three-month CME Term SOFR  plus the applicable tenor spread adjustment  will replace three-month USD LIBOR for each of these Annex 3 USD LIBOR Securities on and after the LIBOR Replacement Date in the same manner as described above for the Annex 1 and Annex 2 USD LIBOR Securities.Tenor Spread AdjustmentThe tenor spread adjustment for CME Term SOFR with respect to the following tenors of USD LIBOR  as set forth in the LIBOR Act and the LIBOR Rule  is:Tenor Tenor spread adjustment One Month 0.11448 % Three Months 0.26161 %Conforming ChangesFor the USD LIBOR Securities for which the Board-selected benchmark replacement becomes the benchmark replacement for USD LIBOR by operation of law under the LIBOR Act (the USD LIBOR Securities listed in Annex 1) or because selected as such by a determining person (the USD LIBOR Securities listed in Annex 2)  the LIBOR Rule provides that certain benchmark replacement conforming changes will become an integral part of such securities by operation of law. See Annex 4 for a description of such conforming changes. In addition  a person responsible for calculating or determining any valuation  payment or other measurement based on a benchmark (a ""calculating person"") has the authority under the LIBOR Act and the LIBOR Rule to make certain additional benchmark replacement conforming changes (in addition to those specified in LIBOR Rule) under securities such as the USD LIBOR Securities listed in Annex 1 and Annex 2 without any requirement to obtain consent from any other person. Any such additional changes that the applicable calculating person makes with respect to such USD LIBOR Securities will become an integral part of the applicable securities by operation of law and be the subject of a separate announcement on the Investors/Fixed Income portion of BAC's website.Under the terms of the USD LIBOR Securities listed in Annex 3  BAC  as issuer  will have the right to make benchmark replacement conforming changes. It is expected that BAC will determine that the benchmark replacement conforming changes adopted by the Board under the LIBOR Rule will also apply to such USD LIBOR Securities. If BAC makes any additional benchmark replacement conforming changes with respect to such USD LIBOR Securities  such additional changes will be the subject of a separate announcement on the Investors/Fixed Income portion of BAC's website.This press release applies only to the USD LIBOR Securities listed in the Annexes to this press release and does not relate to any other securities or other instruments. In advance of the LIBOR Replacement Date  further notices relating to CME Term SOFR as the benchmark replacement rate for USD LIBOR for the USD LIBOR Securities held through The Depository Trust Company (""DTC"") will be made pursuant to the DTC LIBOR Replacement Index Communication Tool.Forward-Looking StatementsCertain statements contained in this press release may constitute ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

The special dividend is not required to be included within this Notice of AGM.VOTING AT THE AGMI will  once again  be inviting you to vote on all Resolutions at the AGM by way of a poll rather than on a show of hands. Poll voting is in line with practice adopted by many UK public companies and provides a more transparent method of voting. It will result in a more accurate reflection of the views of shareholders by ensuring that every vote is recognised  including the votes of those shareholders who are unable to attend but who have appointed a proxy for the meeting. On a poll  each shareholder has one vote for every share held. I would encourage shareholders to exercise their right to vote; this will ensure that your vote will be counted if ultimately you (or any other proxy you might otherwise appoint) are not able to attend the meeting. Instructions for completing the Form of Proxy are outlined below. The valid appointment of a proxy does not prevent you from attending the AGM and voting in person.ACTION TO BE TAKENPlease complete and return the enclosed Form of Proxy so that it is received by the Company‚Äôs Registrar  Equiniti  by no later than 11 am on Tuesday  9 May 2023. If you are a member of CREST  you may submit a proxy appointment electronically through the CREST voting service. Further details are set out in the Notes section on pages 10 to 11.The results of voting on the Resolutions will be announced via a Regulatory Information Service and posted on the Company‚Äôs website following the conclusion of the AGM.RECOMMENDATIONThe Directors recommend that shareholders vote in favour of each of the Resolutions at the AGM. The Board considers that the Resolutions are in the best interests of the Company‚Äôs shareholders as a whole and will promote the success of the Company for their benefit. The Directors intend to vote in favour of the Resolutions in respect of their own beneficial shareholdings in the Company (save in respect of those Resolutions in which they are interested).Should it become appropriate to revise the current arrangements for the AGM  any such changes will be notified to shareholders through our website (www.osb.co.uk) and  where appropriate  by an announcement made by the Company to a Regulatory Information Service.Yours faithfullyDavid WeymouthChairmanNOTICE OF ANNUAL GENERAL MEETINGNotice is hereby given that the Annual General Meeting of OSB GROUP PLC (the Company) will be held at 90 Whitfield Street  Fitzrovia  London W1T 4EZ on Thursday  11 May 2023 at 11 am to consider and  if thought fit  pass the following Resolutions.Resolutions 1 to 9 will be proposed as ordinary resolutions.

This Notice of AGM and the 2022 Annual Report and Accounts are available at www.osb.co.uk. For the purpose of this Notice  the issued share capital of the Company with voting rights on 23 March 2023  being the latest practicable date prior to the printing of this document  was 430 243 748 ordinary shares of ¬£0.01 each.RESOLUTION 1: 2022 Annual Report and Accounts (ordinary resolution)The Directors of the Company present the Directors‚Äô reports  the Auditor‚Äôs report and the audited financial statements of the Company for the financial year ended 31 December 2022 (the 2022 Annual Report and Accounts) to the AGM as required by the Companies Act 2006.The Company proposes an ordinary resolution to receive the 2022 Annual Report and Accounts and  accordingly  shareholders have the opportunity to raise any questions on those documents under this Resolution.RESOLUTION 2: Directors‚Äô Remuneration Report (excluding the Remuneration Policy) for the year ended 31 December 2022 (ordinary resolution)In accordance with the Companies Act 2006  shareholders are invited to approve the Directors‚Äô Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 December 2022. This consists of the Annual Statement from the Chair of the Group Remuneration and People Committee and the Annual Report on Remuneration  which may be found on pages 142 to 156 of the 2022 Annual Report and Accounts. It details the Directors‚Äô remuneration for the year ended 31 December 2022 and sets out the way in which the Company intends to implement the Directors‚Äô Remuneration Policy in 2023. The Auditor has audited those parts of the Directors‚Äô Remuneration Report required to be audited and its report can be found on pages 169 to 178 of the 2022 Annual Report and Accounts. For the purposes of this Resolution  the Directors‚Äô Remuneration Report does not include the Directors‚Äô Remuneration Policy. The vote on Resolution 2 is advisory only and the Directors‚Äô entitlement to remuneration is not conditional on it being passed.The Companies Act 2006 requires the Directors‚Äô Remuneration Policy to be put to shareholders for approval annually unless the approved policy remains unchanged  in which case it need only be put to shareholders for approval at least every three years. The Company is not proposing any changes to the Directors‚Äô Remuneration Policy that was approved at the Annual General Meeting in 2022.RESOLUTION 3: Final dividend (ordinary resolution)A final dividend of 21.8 pence per ordinary share has been recommended by the Board for the year ended 31 December 2022 and  if approved by shareholders  will be paid on 17 May 2023 to all shareholders on the register at the close of business on 24 March 2023.RESOLUTIONS 4 (a) to (h): Election and re-election of Directors (ordinary resolutions)Resolution 4(a) relates to the election of a Director. Kal Atwal is standing for election as an Independent Non-Executive Director having been appointed to the Board of Directors with effect from 7 February 2023.Resolutions 4(b) to (h) relate to the retirement and re-election of the Company‚Äôs Directors. The Company‚Äôs articles of association require each Director to retire at the AGM. This is in line with best practice recommendations of the Financial Reporting Council‚Äôs UK Corporate Governance Code.The Board has confirmed  following a performance review  that each of the Directors standing for re-election continues to be an effective member of the Board  to make a positive contribution and to demonstrate commitment to his or her role. The Board believes that the considerable and wide-ranging experience of the Directors will continue to be invaluable to the Company. The Board considers that Kal Atwal has and will continue to make a valuable contribution to the Board and that she has sufficient time to devote to the Company‚Äôs affairs. The appointment of Kal Atwal has been recommended by the Group Nomination and Governance Committee. The biographies of Directors can be found in the Appendix to this document and also on the Company‚Äôs website www.osb.co.uk.RESOLUTIONS 5 AND 6: Re-appointment and remuneration of the Auditor (ordinary resolutions)The Company is required to appoint an auditor at each general meeting at which accounts are laid before the Company  to hold office until the conclusion of the next such meeting. The Group Audit Committee has recommended to the Board  the re-appointment of Deloitte LLP as Auditor of the Company and  has confirmed to the Board that its recommendation is free from third party influence and that no restrictive contractual provisions have been imposed on the Company limiting the choice of auditor. Resolution 5 proposes the re-appointment of Deloitte LLP as the Auditor of the Company and Resolution 6 authorises the Group Audit Committee to agree the Auditor‚Äôs remuneration.RESOLUTION 7: Authority to make political donations (ordinary resolution)Section 368 of the Companies Act 2006 (the Act) prohibits companies from making political donations exceeding ¬£5 000 in aggregate in any 12-month period to (i) political parties  (ii) other political organisations and (iii) independent election candidates  and from incurring political expenditure  without shareholder approval. In line with the Group‚Äôs policy  neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries made any political donations nor incurred any political expenditure during 2022. It is not proposed or intended to alter this policy. However  some of the Group‚Äôs activities may potentially fall within the wide definitions of ‚Äòpolitical donation‚Äô or ‚Äòpolitical expenditure‚Äô in the Act and  without the necessary statutory authorisation  the Group‚Äôs ability to communicate its views effectively to political audiences and to relevant interest groups could be inhibited. Such activities may include briefings at receptions or conferences ‚Äì when the Group seeks to communicate its views on issues vital to its business interests ‚Äì including  for example  conferences of a party political nature or of special interest groups in specific areas.Accordingly  the Company believes that the authority contained in this Resolution is necessary to allow it and its subsidiaries to fund activities which it is in the interests of shareholders that the Company should support. Such authority will enable the Company and its subsidiaries to be sure that they do not  because of any uncertainty as to the bodies or the activities covered by the Companies Act 2006  unintentionally commit a technical breach of the statutes. Any political donation made or expenditure incurred under authority of this Resolution will be disclosed in next year‚Äôs Annual Report and Accounts.This authority replaces the similar authority given to the Directors at the Annual General Meeting in 2022 and will expire at close of business on 30 June 2024 or  if earlier  at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting of the Company to be held in 2024.RESOLUTION 8: Directors‚Äô authority to allot shares (ordinary resolution)The Directors currently have a general authority to allot new ordinary shares in the capital of the Company and to grant rights to subscribe for  or convert any securities into  shares. This authority is  however  due to expire at the AGM and the Board would like to renew it to provide the Directors with flexibility to allot new shares and grant rights up until the Company‚Äôs next AGM within the limits prescribed by The Investment Association.The Investment Association‚Äôs guidelines on Directors‚Äô authority to allot shares state that the Association‚Äôs members will regard as routine any proposal at a general meeting to seek a general authority to allot an amount up to two-thirds of the existing share capital  provided that any amount in excess of one-third of the existing share capital is applied to a fully pre-emptive offer (including an offer by way of a rights issue or open offer) only. Accordingly  if passed  this resolution will authorise the Directors to allot (or grant rights over) new shares in the Company: (i) under an open offer or in other situations (including a rights issue) up to an aggregate nominal amount of ¬£1 434 146.62 (representing approximately one-third of the Company‚Äôs issued ordinary share capital); and (ii) under a fully pre-emptive offer (including an offer by way of a rights issue or open offer) only  up to a further aggregate nominal amount of ¬£1 434 146.62 (representing approximately one-third of the Company‚Äôs issued ordinary share capital). In each case  the reference to the Company‚Äôs issued ordinary share capital is to the issued ordinary share capital as at 23 March 2023 (being the latest practicable date prior to publication of this document).If passed  this authority will expire at the close of business on 30 June 2024 or  if earlier  at the conclusion of the AGM to be held in 2024.The Directors have no present intention of exercising this authority  however  the Board considers it prudent to maintain the flexibility that it provides to enable the Directors to respond to any appropriate opportunities that may arise. The Company did not hold any shares in treasury as at 23 March 2023.RESOLUTION 9: Directors‚Äô authority to allot shares in relation to the issue of Regulatory Capital Convertible Instruments (ordinary resolution)This Resolution renews the Directors‚Äô authority to allot shares or grant rights to subscribe for or convert any security into ordinary shares up to an aggregate nominal amount of ¬£516 292.50  in connection with the issue of ‚ÄòRegulatory Capital Convertible Instruments‚Äô. Regulatory Capital Convertible Instruments are any securities to be issued by the Company or any member of the Group  or by a Company outside of the Group with the consent of the Company or a member of the Group and which are intended on issue to form all or part of a type or class of securities  the terms of which are eligible to meet any Regulatory Capital Requirements and which are:convertible into or exchangeable for ordinary shares of the Company; orissued together with share warrants relating to ordinary shares of the Company;and in each case  which grant to  or require  the holder of such security and/or its nominee a right or obligation (as applicable) to subscribe for such ordinary shares following a specified event relating to an actual or prospective adverse change in the capital position or viability of the Company  any member of the Group or the Group as a whole or any other event specified in the Regulatory Capital Requirements and otherwise on such terms as may be determined by the Directors of the Company or a Committee thereof upon issue.The Board believes it is in the best interests of the Company to have the flexibility to issue Regulatory Capital Convertible Instruments at any time and from time to time. The authority sought in this Resolution will be used as considered desirable to comply with or maintain compliance with such Regulatory Capital Requirements or targets applicable to the Company. Regulatory Capital Requirements are specified by the Prudential Regulation Authority or such other authority having primary supervisory authority with respect to the Company from time to time in relation to the margin of solvency  capital resources  capital  contingent capital or buffer capital of the Company  a member of the Group or the Group taken as a whole.The Company intends to seek to renew authority for the issuance of such Regulatory Capital Convertible Instruments on an annual basis.The amount of this authority is  in aggregate  equivalent to approximately 12 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company as at 23 March 2023 (being the latest practicable date before the publication of this document). No ordinary shares were held in treasury as at that date.Resolutions 9 and 12 are intended to provide the Directors with the flexibility to authorise the issue of Regulatory Capital Convertible Instruments which contain contractual debt to equity conversion features. The Resolutions are not intended to provide authority for any future UK statutory conversion requirements as may become part of UK national law in the future  for which such authority would not be required.The authority sought in Resolution 9 is separate and distinct from the authority sought in Resolution 8 which is the usual authority sought on an annual basis in line with guidance issued by The Investment Association. The authority sought in Resolution 9 will expire at the close of business on 30 June 2024 or  if earlier  at the conclusion of the AGM to be held in 2024.RESOLUTIONS 10 and 11: Disapplication of statutory pre-emption rights (special resolutions)Resolutions 10 and 11 are proposed as special resolutions which  if passed by shareholders  will enable the Directors to allot ordinary shares in the Company  and/or to sell any shares out of treasury  for cash  without first offering those shares to existing shareholders in proportion to their existing holdings.In November 2022  the Pre-Emption Group issued a revised Statement of Principles (the Revised Statement of Principles) which permits companies to seek authorities to issue equity securities for cash on a non-pre-emptive basis representing: (i) up to 10 per cent of a company‚Äôs issued ordinary share capital for use on an unrestricted basis (plus a further authority of up to 2 per cent of a company‚Äôs issued ordinary share capital to be used only for the purposes of making a follow-on offer of the kind contemplated by paragraph 3 of Section 2B of the Revised Statement of Principles); and (ii) up to an additional 10 per cent of a company‚Äôs issued ordinary share capital for use in connection with an acquisition or a specified capital investment  which is announced contemporaneously with the issue  or that has taken place in the preceding 12 month period and is disclosed in the announcement of the issue (plus a further authority of up to 2 per cent of a company‚Äôs issued ordinary share capital to be used only for the purposes of making a follow-on offer of the kind contemplated by paragraph 3 of Section 2B of the Revised Statement of Principles).Having considered the Revised Statement of Principles  the Board believes that the limits in the Company‚Äôs previous pre-emption disapplication authorities provide the Company with sufficient flexibility at this time. The Board will keep this matter under review and will consider whether to seek increased authorities up to the revised limits detailed in the Revised Statement of Principles in future years.Accordingly  the power set out in Resolution 10 would be limited to:allotments or sales in connection with pre-emptive offers and offers to holders of other equity securities if required by the rights of those securities  or as the Board otherwise considers necessary; andotherwise up to an aggregate nominal amount of ¬£215 121.87 (representing 21 512 187 ordinary shares and 5 per cent of the Company‚Äôs issued ordinary share capital as at 23 March 2023 (being the latest practicable date before the publication of this document).In addition  Resolution 11 is intended to give the Company flexibility to make non-pre-emptive issues of ordinary shares in connection with acquisitions and other capital investments as contemplated by the Revised Statement of Principles. The power under Resolution 11 is in addition to that proposed by Resolution 10 and would be limited to allotments or sales of up to aggregate nominal amount ¬£215 121.87 (representing 21 512 187 ordinary shares and 5 per cent of the Company‚Äôs issued ordinary share capital as at 23 March 2023 (being the latest practicable date before the publication of this document).If the Company makes a non-pre-emptive issue of ordinary shares for cash using the power conferred by Resolution 10 or Resolution 11 described above  the Directors confirm their intention to comply with the shareholder protections contained in Part 2B of the Revised Statement of Principles regarding how such an issue should be carried out.The authorities sought under Resolutions 10 and 11 will expire at close of business on 30 June 2024 or  if earlier  at the conclusion of the AGM to be held in 2024.RESOLUTION 12: Disapplication of statutory pre-emption rights in relation to the issue of Regulatory Capital Convertible Instruments (special resolution)Resolution 9 renews the Directors‚Äô authority to allot shares or grant rights to subscribe for or convert any security into ordinary shares up to an aggregate nominal amount of ¬£516 292.50 specifically in connection with the issue of Regulatory Capital Convertible Instruments. Resolution 12 proposes that the Directors be empowered to allot equity securities pursuant to that authority for cash  without first offering those equity securities to existing shareholders in proportion to their existing holdings. ¬£516 292.50 is equivalent to approximately 12 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company as at 23 March 2023 (being the latest practicable date before the publication of this document).Renewing this Resolution will permit the Company the flexibility necessary to allot equity securities pursuant to any proposal to issue Regulatory Capital Convertible Instruments and  by virtue of such disapplication  without the need to comply with the pre-emption requirements of the UK statutory regime. Together with Resolution 9  Resolution 12 is intended to provide the Directors with the flexibility to issue Regulatory Capital Convertible Instruments which may convert into ordinary shares.Conditional upon the passing of Resolutions 9 and 12  the Directors would not expect to make use of Resolutions 8 and 10 to issue Regulatory Capital Convertible Instruments  however  they may do so  to the extent permissible  if deemed appropriate in light of capital requirements  market conditions and/or high demand. Any exercise of the authorities in Resolutions 8 and 10 (if passed) would be separate from  and in addition to  the exercise of powers under Resolutions 9 and 12 and would have the effect of diluting the interests of ordinary shareholders.RESOLUTION 13: Authority to purchase own shares (special resolution)The authority limits the maximum number of shares that could be purchased to 43 024 375 (representing approximately 10 per cent of the Company‚Äôs issued ordinary share capital as at 23 March 2023) and sets minimum and maximum prices at which shares may be purchased.This authority replaces the similar authority given to the Directors at the Annual General Meeting in 2022 and will expire at the close of business on 30 June 2024 or  if earlier  at the conclusion of the AGM to be held in 2024. A listed company purchasing its own shares may hold those shares in treasury and make them available for re-sale as an alternative to cancelling them. Accordingly  if this Resolution is passed  the Company will have the option of holding  as treasury shares  any of its own shares that it purchases pursuant to the authority conferred.This would give the Company the ability to sell treasury shares quickly and cost-effectively and provide the Company with additional flexibility in the management of its capital base. No dividends are paid and no voting rights are attached to shares held in treasury. The Company did not hold any shares in treasury as at 23 March 2023 (being the latest practicable date before the publication of this document). As at that date  there were 2 137 904 options to subscribe for ordinary shares in the capital of the Company  representing 0.50 per cent of the Company‚Äôs issued ordinary share capital. If the full authority conferred by this Resolution were to be exercised in full  these options would represent 0.55 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company.On 16 March 2023  the Company announced its intention to commence an ordinary share repurchase programme pursuant to the authority granted at last year‚Äôs AGM  in order to return up to ¬£150 million to shareholders (the Share Repurchase Programme). The Share Repurchase Programme will help to deliver on the Company‚Äôs stated intention to deliver attractive and sustainable returns to shareholders across the cycle. It is the Company‚Äôs present intention for any repurchased ordinary shares to be cancelled and the Share Repurchase Programme is expected to complete by no later than 15 March 2024.The Directors regard having the flexibility to repurchase issued shares in suitable circumstances as an important part of the financial management of the Company. The Directors may consider exercising the authority to purchase the Company‚Äôs ordinary shares if market conditions and the Company‚Äôs financial position make this possible but will keep the matter under review. Shares would only be purchased if the Directors believed that to do so would result in an improvement in earnings per share and would be in the interests of shareholders generally. Any purchases of ordinary shares would be by means of market purchases on a recognised investment exchange and purchased shares would be cancelled (in which case the number of shares in issue would thereby be reduced) or  alternatively  held in treasury  depending on which course of action is considered by the Directors to be in the best interests of the shareholders at that time.RESOLUTION 14: Notice of general meetings (special resolution)The statutory notice period required for general meetings of the Company is at least 21 clear days unless shareholders approve a shorter notice period  which cannot  however  be less than 14 clear days (AGMs will continue to be held on at least 21 clear days‚Äô notice). At last year‚Äôs AGM  shareholders passed a resolution enabling the Company to call general meetings  other than an AGM  on at least 14 clear days‚Äô notice. This approval must be renewed at each AGM  so  in order to preserve this ability  Resolution 14 seeks such approval.It is intended that the shorter notice period would not be used as a matter of routine for such meetings but only where the flexibility is merited by the business of the meeting and is thought to be in the interests of shareholders as a whole. If given  the approval will be effective until the Company‚Äôs next AGM  when it is intended that a similar resolution will be proposed.NOTES1. The Company strongly encourages all shareholders to submit a proxy vote in advance of the AGM  appointing the Chairman of the meeting as their proxy rather than a named person. These notes to the Notice should be read in this context.2. Only persons entered on the Register of Members of the Company at 6.30 pm on Tuesday  9 May 2023 (or  if the AGM is adjourned  at 6.30 pm on the date which is two business days prior to the adjourned meeting) shall be entitled to attend and vote at the AGM oradjourned meeting. Changes to entries on the Register of Members after this time shall be disregarded in determining the rights of persons to attend or vote (and the number of votes they may cast) at the AGM or adjourned meeting.3. A shareholder entitled to attend and vote at the AGM may appoint another person as her/his proxy to exercise all or any of her/his rights to attend  speak and vote at the AGM. A shareholder can appoint more than one proxy in relation to the AGM  provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share or shares held by that shareholder.4. A proxy does not need to be a shareholder of the Company but must attend the AGM to represent you. Your proxy could be the Chairman or another person who has agreed to attend to represent you. If you wish for a proxy to make any comments on your behalf at the AGM  you will need to appoint someone other than the Chairman of the meeting and give them the relevant instructions directly. Those submitting a Form of Proxy are strongly encouraged to appoint the Chairman of the meeting rather than a named person as their proxy. This will ensure that your vote will be counted even if ultimately you (or any other proxy you might otherwise appoint) are not able to attend the meeting. The valid appointment of a proxy does not prevent you from attending the AGM and voting in person.5. A shareholder who wishes to appoint a proxy should complete the Form of Proxy which accompanies this notice and includes full details of how to appoint a proxy. If you do not have a Form of Proxy and believe that you should have one  or if you require additional Forms of Proxy  please contact Equiniti‚Äôs helpline on 0371 384 2701 (+44 (0) 371 384 2701 if calling from overseas). Lines are open between 8.30 am and 5.30 pm Monday to Friday (excluding public holidays in England and Wales). Shareholders who hold their shares in uncertificated form may use ‚Äòthe CREST voting service‚Äô to appoint a proxy electronically  as explained below.6. In order to be valid  a proxy appointment must be returned (together with any power of attorney or other authority under which it is executed or a copy of the authority certified in ink by a bank  a stockbroker or a solicitor) by one of the following methods:‚Äì in hard copy form by post  by courier or by hand to the Company‚Äôs registrar at the address shown on the Form of Proxy; or in the case of CREST members  by utilising the CREST voting service in accordance with the procedures set out in note 9 below.The appointment of a proxy in each case must formally be received by the Company‚Äôs registrar no later than 11 am on Tuesday  9 May 2023.You may also appoint your proxy electronically online at www.sharevote.co.uk where full instructions on the procedure are given. The Voting ID  Task ID and Shareholder Reference Number printed on the Form of Proxy will be required to use this electronic proxy appointment system. Alternatively  shareholders who have already registered with Equiniti Registrars‚Äô online portfolio service  Shareview  can appoint their proxy electronically by logging on to their portfolio at www.shareview.co.uk using their user ID and password. Once logged in  click ‚Äòview‚Äô on the ‚ÄòMy Investments‚Äô page. Click on the link to vote and follow the on screen instructions.7. To change your proxy instructions you may return a new proxy appointment using the methods set out above. Where you have appointed a proxy using the hard copy Form of Proxy and would like to change the instructions using another hard copy Form of Proxy  please contact Equiniti at Aspect House  Spencer Road  Lancing  West Sussex BN99 8LU. The deadline for receipt of proxy appointments (see above) also applies in relation to amended instructions. Any attempt to terminate or amend a proxy appointment received after the relevant deadline will be disregarded. Where two or more valid but differing appointments of proxy are delivered or (in the case of appointments in electronic form) received in respect of the same share for use at the same meeting  the one which is last delivered or  as the case may be  received as aforesaid (regardless of its date  its date of sending or the date of its execution) shall be treated as replacing and revoking the other or others as regards that share. If the Company is unable to determine either which is last sent or which is last delivered or received  none of them shall be treated as valid in respect of the relevant share(s).In the case of joint holders  where more than one of the joint holders purports to appoint a proxy  only the appointment submitted by the most senior holder will be accepted. Seniority is determined by the order in which the names of the joint holders appear in the Company‚Äôs register of members in respect of the joint holding (the first-named being the most senior).8. A copy of this notice has been sent for information only  to Nominated Persons (that is  a person who has been nominated by a shareholder to enjoy information rights under section 146 of the Companies Act 2006). The rights to appoint a proxy cannot be exercised by a Nominated Person; they can only be exercised by a shareholder. However  a Nominated Person may have a right under an agreement with the shareholder by whom she or he was nominated to be appointed as a proxy for the AGM or to have someone else so appointed. If a Nominated Person does not have such a right or does not wish to exercise it  she or he may have a right under such an agreement to give instructions to the shareholder as to the exercise of voting rights.9. CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies by utilising the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so by utilising the procedures described in the CREST Manual  which can be viewed at www.euroclear.com. CREST personal members or other CREST sponsored members  and those CREST members who have appointed a voting service provider(s)  should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s)  who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf. In order for a proxy appointment made by means of CREST to be valid  the appropriate CREST message (a CREST Proxy Instruction) must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear‚Äôs specifications and must contain the information required for such instructions  as described in the CREST Manual. The message  regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or an amendment to the instruction given to a previously appointed proxy must  in order to be valid  be transmitted so as to be received by the issuer‚Äôs agent (ID number RA19) by 11 am on Tuesday  9 May 2023 (the latest time(s) for receipt of proxy appointments specified in this notice). For this purpose  the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Applications Host) from which the issuer‚Äôs agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001.10. CREST members and  where applicable  their CREST sponsors or voting service providers should note that Euroclear does not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or  if the CREST member is a CREST personal member or sponsored member or has appointed a voting service provider(s)  to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection  CREST members and  where applicable  their CREST sponsors or voting service providers are referred  in particular  to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings.11. Voting on all Resolutions will be conducted by way of a poll rather than a show of hands. This is a more transparent method of voting as shareholders‚Äô votes (including the votes of those shareholders who are unable to attend but who have appointed a proxy for the meeting) are to be counted according to the number of shares held. As soon as practicable  following the AGM  the results of the voting will be announced via a Regulatory Information Service and also placed on the Company‚Äôs website: osb.co.uk/investors/shareholder-services/.12. Please note that the Company takes all reasonable precautions to ensure that no viruses are present in any electronic communication it sends out but the Company cannot accept responsibility for loss or damage arising from the opening or use of any email or attachments from the Company and recommends that shareholders subject all messages to virus checking procedures prior to use. Any electronic communication received by the Company  including the lodgment of an electronic proxy form  that is found to contain any virus will not be accepted.13. A shareholder of the Company  that is a corporation  may authorise a person or persons to act as its representative(s) at the AGM. In accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006  each such representative may exercise (on behalf of the corporation) the same powers as the corporation could exercise if it were an individual shareholder of the Company  provided that they do not do so in relation to the same shares.14. Shareholders satisfying the thresholds in section 527 of the Companies Act 2006 can require the Company to publish a statement on its website setting out any matter relating to the audit of the Company‚Äôs accounts (including the Auditor‚Äôs report and the conduct of the audit) that are to be laid before the AGM and that the shareholders propose to raise at the AGM. The Company may not require the shareholders requesting the publication to pay its expenses. Any statement placed on the website must also be sent to the Company‚Äôs Auditor no later than the time it makes its statement available on the website. The business which may be dealt with at the AGM includes any statement that the Company has been required to publish on its website.15. Under section 319A of the Companies Act 2006  the Company must  subject to limited exceptions  answer any question relating to the business being dealt with at the AGM which is put by a shareholder attending the AGM. Information relating to the AGM which the Company is required by the Companies Act 2006 to publish on a website in advance of the meeting may be viewed at osb.co.uk/investors/ shareholder-services/. You may not use any electronic address provided in this notice to communicate with the Company for any purposes other than those expressly stated.16. Shareholders have the right to ask questions in relation to the business of the AGM but no answer need be given if (a) to do so would interfere unduly with the preparation for the AGM or involve the disclosure of confidential information  (b) the answer has already been given on a website in the form of an answer to a question  or (c) it is undesirable in the interests of the Company or the good order of the AGM that the question be answered. Shareholders wishing to raise any questions relating to the business of the AGM may do so by submitting them to the Company Secretariat ahead of the AGM at company.secretariat@osb.co.uk. You may submit questions until 11 am on Tuesday  9 May 2023 and the Company will endeavour to publish and maintain an appropriate summary of responses on the ‚ÄòAGM Information‚Äô page of its website in advance of the AGM.17.

Shareholders who wish to do so should contact Equiniti by phone on 0371 384 2701 (+44 (0) 371 384 2701 if calling from overseas) or by post at Aspect House  Spencer Road  Lancing  West Sussex BN99 8LU  in each case no later than 30 days following the date of this year‚Äôs AGM.18.

Notice of Annual General Meeting OSB GROUP PLC (incorporated and registered in England and Wales under company number 11976839. Registered office: OSB House  Quayside  Chatham Maritime  Chatham  United Kingdom  ME4 4QZ) Notice of Annual General Meeting on Thursday  11 May 2023 at 11 amat 90 Whitfield Street  Fitzrovia  London W1T 4EZ LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN Dear Shareholder 31 March 2023 2022 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS AND 2023 ANNUAL GENERAL MEETINGI am pleased to inform you that the Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2022 and the Notice of the 2023 Annual General Meeting of OSB GROUP PLC (the Company) have now been published. A copy of the 2022 Annual Report and Accounts is enclosed with this document  together with a Form of Proxy to enable you to exercise your voting rights at the 2023 Annual General Meeting (AGM). The AGM will be held at 90 Whitfield Street  Fitzrovia  London W1T 4EZ on Thursday  11 May 2023 at 11 am. The formal notice of the AGM is set out on pages 3 to 5 of this document and contains the proposed resolutions (the Resolutions). Explanatory notes to the business to be considered are set out from page 6 of this document. You would have seen our declaration of a special dividend to be paid on the same date as the final dividend. The special dividend is not required to be included within this Notice of AGM. VOTING AT THE AGMI will  once again  be inviting you to vote on all Resolutions at the AGM by way of a poll rather than on a show of hands. Poll voting is in line with practice adopted by many UK public companies and provides a more transparent method of voting. It will result in a more accurate reflection of the views of shareholders by ensuring that every vote is recognised  including the votes of those shareholders who are unable to attend but who have appointed a proxy for the meeting. On a poll  each shareholder has one vote for every share held. I would encourage shareholders to exercise their right to vote; this will ensure that your vote will be counted if ultimately you (or any other proxy you might otherwise appoint) are not able to attend the meeting. Instructions for completing the Form of Proxy are outlined below. The valid appointment of a proxy does not prevent you from attending the AGM and voting in person. ACTION TO BE TAKENPlease complete and return the enclosed Form of Proxy so that it is received by the Company‚Äôs Registrar  Equiniti  by no later than 11 am on Tuesday  9 May 2023. If you are a member of CREST  you may submit a proxy appointment electronically through the CREST voting service. Further details are set out in the Notes section on pages 10 to 11. The results of voting on the Resolutions will be announced via a Regulatory Information Service and posted on the Company‚Äôs website following the conclusion of the AGM. RECOMMENDATIONThe Directors recommend that shareholders vote in favour of each of the Resolutions at the AGM. The Board considers that the Resolutions are in the best interests of the Company‚Äôs shareholders as a whole and will promote the success of the Company for their benefit. The Directors intend to vote in favour of the Resolutions in respect of their own beneficial shareholdings in the Company (save in respect of those Resolutions in which they are interested). Should it become appropriate to revise the current arrangements for the AGM  any such changes will be notified to shareholders through our website (www.osb.co.uk) and  where appropriate  by an announcement made by the Company to a Regulatory Information Service.

These explanatory notes should be read in conjunction with the 2022 Annual Report and Accounts. This Notice of AGM and the 2022 Annual Report and Accounts are available at www.osb.co.uk. For the purpose of this Notice  the issued share capital of the Company with voting rights on 23 March 2023  being the latest practicable date prior to the printing of this document  was 430 243 748 ordinary shares of ¬£0.01 each. RESOLUTION 1: 2022 Annual Report and Accounts (ordinary resolution)The Directors of the Company present the Directors‚Äô reports  the Auditor‚Äôs report and the audited financial statements of the Company for the financial year ended 31 December 2022 (the 2022 Annual Report and Accounts) to the AGM as required by the Companies Act 2006. The Company proposes an ordinary resolution to receive the 2022 Annual Report and Accounts and  accordingly  shareholders have the opportunity to raise any questions on those documents under this Resolution. RESOLUTION 2: Directors‚Äô Remuneration Report (excluding the Remuneration Policy) for the year ended 31 December 2022 (ordinary resolution)In accordance with the Companies Act 2006  shareholders are invited to approve the Directors‚Äô Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 December 2022. This consists of the Annual Statement from the Chair of the Group Remuneration and People Committee and the Annual Report on Remuneration  which may be found on pages 142 to 156 of the 2022 Annual Report and Accounts. It details the Directors‚Äô remuneration for the year ended 31 December 2022 and sets out the way in which the Company intends to implement the Directors‚Äô Remuneration Policy in 2023. The Auditor has audited those parts of the Directors‚Äô Remuneration Report required to be audited and its report can be found on pages 169 to 178 of the 2022 Annual Report and Accounts. For the purposes of this Resolution  the Directors‚Äô Remuneration Report does not include the Directors‚Äô Remuneration Policy. The vote on Resolution 2 is advisory only and the Directors‚Äô entitlement to remuneration is not conditional on it being passed. The Companies Act 2006 requires the Directors‚Äô Remuneration Policy to be put to shareholders for approval annually unless the approved policy remains unchanged  in which case it need only be put to shareholders for approval at least every three years. The Company is not proposing any changes to the Directors‚Äô Remuneration Policy that was approved at the Annual General Meeting in 2022. RESOLUTION 3: Final dividend (ordinary resolution)A final dividend of 21.8 pence per ordinary share has been recommended by the Board for the year ended 31 December 2022 and  if approved by shareholders  will be paid on 17 May 2023 to all shareholders on the register at the close of business on 24 March 2023. RESOLUTIONS 4 (a) to (h): Election and re-election of Directors (ordinary resolutions)Resolution 4(a) relates to the election of a Director. Kal Atwal is standing for election as an Independent Non-Executive Director having been appointed to the Board of Directors with effect from 7 February 2023. Resolutions 4(b) to (h) relate to the retirement and re-election of the Company‚Äôs Directors. The Company‚Äôs articles of association require each Director to retire at the AGM. This is in line with best practice recommendations of the Financial Reporting Council‚Äôs UK Corporate Governance Code. The Board has confirmed  following a performance review  that each of the Directors standing for re-election continues to be an effective member of the Board  to make a positive contribution and to demonstrate commitment to his or her role. The Board believes that the considerable and wide-ranging experience of the Directors will continue to be invaluable to the Company. The Board considers that Kal Atwal has and will continue to make a valuable contribution to the Board and that she has sufficient time to devote to the Company‚Äôs affairs. The appointment of Kal Atwal has been recommended by the Group Nomination and Governance Committee. The biographies of Directors can be found in the Appendix to this document and also on the Company‚Äôs website www.osb.co.uk. RESOLUTIONS 5 AND 6: Re-appointment and remuneration of the Auditor (ordinary resolutions)The Company is required to appoint an auditor at each general meeting at which accounts are laid before the Company  to hold office until the conclusion of the next such meeting. The Group Audit Committee has recommended to the Board  the re-appointment of Deloitte LLP as Auditor of the Company and  has confirmed to the Board that its recommendation is free from third party influence and that no restrictive contractual provisions have been imposed on the Company limiting the choice of auditor. Resolution 5 proposes the re-appointment of Deloitte LLP as the Auditor of the Company and Resolution 6 authorises the Group Audit Committee to agree the Auditor‚Äôs remuneration. RESOLUTION 7: Authority to make political donations (ordinary resolution)Section 368 of the Companies Act 2006 (the Act) prohibits companies from making political donations exceeding ¬£5 000 in aggregate in any 12-month period to (i) political parties  (ii) other political organisations and (iii) independent election candidates  and from incurring political expenditure  without shareholder approval. In line with the Group‚Äôs policy  neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries made any political donations nor incurred any political expenditure during 2022. It is not proposed or intended to alter this policy. However  some of the Group‚Äôs activities may potentially fall within the wide definitions of ‚Äòpolitical donation‚Äô or ‚Äòpolitical expenditure‚Äô in the Act and  without the necessary statutory authorisation  the Group‚Äôs ability to communicate its views effectively to political audiences and to relevant interest groups could be inhibited. Such activities may include briefings at receptions or conferences ‚Äì when the Group seeks to communicate its views on issues vital to its business interests ‚Äì including  for example  conferences of a party political nature or of special interest groups in specific areas. Accordingly  the Company believes that the authority contained in this Resolution is necessary to allow it and its subsidiaries to fund activities which it is in the interests of shareholders that the Company should support. Such authority will enable the Company and its subsidiaries to be sure that they do not  because of any uncertainty as to the bodies or the activities covered by the Companies Act 2006  unintentionally commit a technical breach of the statutes. Any political donation made or expenditure incurred under authority of this Resolution will be disclosed in next year‚Äôs Annual Report and Accounts. This authority replaces the similar authority given to the Directors at the Annual General Meeting in 2022 and will expire at close of business on 30 June 2024 or  if earlier  at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting of the Company to be held in 2024. RESOLUTION 8: Directors‚Äô authority to allot shares (ordinary resolution)The Directors currently have a general authority to allot new ordinary shares in the capital of the Company and to grant rights to subscribe for  or convert any securities into  shares. This authority is  however  due to expire at the AGM and the Board would like to renew it to provide the Directors with flexibility to allot new shares and grant rights up until the Company‚Äôs next AGM within the limits prescribed by The Investment Association. The Investment Association‚Äôs guidelines on Directors‚Äô authority to allot shares state that the Association‚Äôs members will regard as routine any proposal at a general meeting to seek a general authority to allot an amount up to two-thirds of the existing share capital  provided that any amount in excess of one-third of the existing share capital is applied to a fully pre-emptive offer (including an offer by way of a rights issue or open offer) only. Accordingly  if passed  this resolution will authorise the Directors to allot (or grant rights over) new shares in the Company: (i) under an open offer or in other situations (including a rights issue) up to an aggregate nominal amount of ¬£1 434 146.62 (representing approximately one-third of the Company‚Äôs issued ordinary share capital); and (ii) under a fully pre-emptive offer (including an offer by way of a rights issue or open offer) only  up to a further aggregate nominal amount of ¬£1 434 146.62 (representing approximately one-third of the Company‚Äôs issued ordinary share capital). In each case  the reference to the Company‚Äôs issued ordinary share capital is to the issued ordinary share capital as at 23 March 2023 (being the latest practicable date prior to publication of this document). If passed  this authority will expire at the close of business on 30 June 2024 or  if earlier  at the conclusion of the AGM to be held in 2024.The Directors have no present intention of exercising this authority  however  the Board considers it prudent to maintain the flexibility that it provides to enable the Directors to respond to any appropriate opportunities that may arise. The Company did not hold any shares in treasury as at 23 March 2023. RESOLUTION 9: Directors‚Äô authority to allot shares in relation to the issue of Regulatory Capital Convertible Instruments (ordinary resolution)This Resolution renews the Directors‚Äô authority to allot shares or grant rights to subscribe for or convert any security into ordinary shares up to an aggregate nominal amount of ¬£516 292.50  in connection with the issue of ‚ÄòRegulatory Capital Convertible Instruments‚Äô. Regulatory Capital Convertible Instruments are any securities to be issued by the Company or any member of the Group  or by a Company outside of the Group with the consent of the Company or a member of the Group and which are intended on issue to form all or part of a type or class of securities  the terms of which are eligible to meet any Regulatory Capital Requirements and which are: convertible into or exchangeable for ordinary shares of the Company; orissued together with share warrants relating to ordinary shares of the Company;and in each case  which grant to  or require  the holder of such security and/or its nominee a right or obligation (as applicable) to subscribe for such ordinary shares following a specified event relating to an actual or prospective adverse change in the capital position or viability of the Company  any member of the Group or the Group as a whole or any other event specified in the Regulatory Capital Requirements and otherwise on such terms as may be determined by the Directors of the Company or a Committee thereof upon issue. The Board believes it is in the best interests of the Company to have the flexibility to issue Regulatory Capital Convertible Instruments at any time and from time to time. The authority sought in this Resolution will be used as considered desirable to comply with or maintain compliance with such Regulatory Capital Requirements or targets applicable to the Company. Regulatory Capital Requirements are specified by the Prudential Regulation Authority or such other authority having primary supervisory authority with respect to the Company from time to time in relation to the margin of solvency  capital resources  capital  contingent capital or buffer capital of the Company  a member of the Group or the Group taken as a whole. The Company intends to seek to renew authority for the issuance of such Regulatory Capital Convertible Instruments on an annual basis. The amount of this authority is  in aggregate  equivalent to approximately 12 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company as at 23 March 2023 (being the latest practicable date before the publication of this document). No ordinary shares were held in treasury as at that date. Resolutions 9 and 12 are intended to provide the Directors with the flexibility to authorise the issue of Regulatory Capital Convertible Instruments which contain contractual debt to equity conversion features. The Resolutions are not intended to provide authority for any future UK statutory conversion requirements as may become part of UK national law in the future  for which such authority would not be required. The authority sought in Resolution 9 is separate and distinct from the authority sought in Resolution 8 which is the usual authority sought on an annual basis in line with guidance issued by The Investment Association. The authority sought in Resolution 9 will expire at the close of business on 30 June 2024 or  if earlier  at the conclusion of the AGM to be held in 2024. RESOLUTIONS 10 and 11: Disapplication of statutory pre-emption rights (special resolutions)Resolutions 10 and 11 are proposed as special resolutions which  if passed by shareholders  will enable the Directors to allot ordinary shares in the Company  and/or to sell any shares out of treasury  for cash  without first offering those shares to existing shareholders in proportion to their existing holdings. In November 2022  the Pre-Emption Group issued a revised Statement of Principles (the Revised Statement of Principles) which permits companies to seek authorities to issue equity securities for cash on a non-pre-emptive basis representing: (i) up to 10 per cent of a company‚Äôs issued ordinary share capital for use on an unrestricted basis (plus a further authority of up to 2 per cent of a company‚Äôs issued ordinary share capital to be used only for the purposes of making a follow-on offer of the kind contemplated by paragraph 3 of Section 2B of the Revised Statement of Principles); and (ii) up to an additional 10 per cent of a company‚Äôs issued ordinary share capital for use in connection with an acquisition or a specified capital investment  which is announced contemporaneously with the issue  or that has taken place in the preceding 12 month period and is disclosed in the announcement of the issue (plus a further authority of up to 2 per cent of a company‚Äôs issued ordinary share capital to be used only for the purposes of making a follow-on offer of the kind contemplated by paragraph 3 of Section 2B of the Revised Statement of Principles). Having considered the Revised Statement of Principles  the Board believes that the limits in the Company‚Äôs previous pre-emption disapplication authorities provide the Company with sufficient flexibility at this time. The Board will keep this matter under review and will consider whether to seek increased authorities up to the revised limits detailed in the Revised Statement of Principles in future years. Accordingly  the power set out in Resolution 10 would be limited to: allotments or sales in connection with pre-emptive offers and offers to holders of other equity securities if required by the rights of those securities  or as the Board otherwise considers necessary; andotherwise up to an aggregate nominal amount of ¬£215 121.87 (representing 21 512 187 ordinary shares and 5 per cent of the Company‚Äôs issued ordinary share capital as at 23 March 2023 (being the latest practicable date before the publication of this document).In addition  Resolution 11 is intended to give the Company flexibility to make non-pre-emptive issues of ordinary shares in connection with acquisitions and other capital investments as contemplated by the Revised Statement of Principles. The power under Resolution 11 is in addition to that proposed by Resolution 10 and would be limited to allotments or sales of up to aggregate nominal amount ¬£215 121.87 (representing 21 512 187 ordinary shares and 5 per cent of the Company‚Äôs issued ordinary share capital as at 23 March 2023 (being the latest practicable date before the publication of this document). If the Company makes a non-pre-emptive issue of ordinary shares for cash using the power conferred by Resolution 10 or Resolution 11 described above  the Directors confirm their intention to comply with the shareholder protections contained in Part 2B of the Revised Statement of Principles regarding how such an issue should be carried out. The authorities sought under Resolutions 10 and 11 will expire at close of business on 30 June 2024 or  if earlier  at the conclusion of the AGM to be held in 2024. RESOLUTION 12: Disapplication of statutory pre-emption rights in relation to the issue of Regulatory Capital Convertible Instruments (special resolution)Resolution 9 renews the Directors‚Äô authority to allot shares or grant rights to subscribe for or convert any security into ordinary shares up to an aggregate nominal amount of ¬£516 292.50 specifically in connection with the issue of Regulatory Capital Convertible Instruments. Resolution 12 proposes that the Directors be empowered to allot equity securities pursuant to that authority for cash  without first offering those equity securities to existing shareholders in proportion to their existing holdings. ¬£516 292.50 is equivalent to approximately 12 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company as at 23 March 2023 (being the latest practicable date before the publication of this document). Renewing this Resolution will permit the Company the flexibility necessary to allot equity securities pursuant to any proposal to issue Regulatory Capital Convertible Instruments and  by virtue of such disapplication  without the need to comply with the pre-emption requirements of the UK statutory regime. Together with Resolution 9  Resolution 12 is intended to provide the Directors with the flexibility to issue Regulatory Capital Convertible Instruments which may convert into ordinary shares. Conditional upon the passing of Resolutions 9 and 12  the Directors would not expect to make use of Resolutions 8 and 10 to issue Regulatory Capital Convertible Instruments  however  they may do so  to the extent permissible  if deemed appropriate in light of capital requirements  market conditions and/or high demand. Any exercise of the authorities in Resolutions 8 and 10 (if passed) would be separate from  and in addition to  the exercise of powers under Resolutions 9 and 12 and would have the effect of diluting the interests of ordinary shareholders. RESOLUTION 13: Authority to purchase own shares (special resolution)The authority limits the maximum number of shares that could be purchased to 43 024 375 (representing approximately 10 per cent of the Company‚Äôs issued ordinary share capital as at 23 March 2023) and sets minimum and maximum prices at which shares may be purchased. This authority replaces the similar authority given to the Directors at the Annual General Meeting in 2022 and will expire at the close of business on 30 June 2024 or  if earlier  at the conclusion of the AGM to be held in 2024. A listed company purchasing its own shares may hold those shares in treasury and make them available for re-sale as an alternative to cancelling them. Accordingly  if this Resolution is passed  the Company will have the option of holding  as treasury shares  any of its own shares that it purchases pursuant to the authority conferred. This would give the Company the ability to sell treasury shares quickly and cost-effectively and provide the Company with additional flexibility in the management of its capital base. No dividends are paid and no voting rights are attached to shares held in treasury. The Company did not hold any shares in treasury as at 23 March 2023 (being the latest practicable date before the publication of this document). As at that date  there were 2 137 904 options to subscribe for ordinary shares in the capital of the Company  representing 0.50 per cent of the Company‚Äôs issued ordinary share capital. If the full authority conferred by this Resolution were to be exercised in full  these options would represent 0.55 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company. On 16 March 2023  the Company announced its intention to commence an ordinary share repurchase programme pursuant to the authority granted at last year‚Äôs AGM  in order to return up to ¬£150 million to shareholders (the Share Repurchase Programme). The Share Repurchase Programme will help to deliver on the Company‚Äôs stated intention to deliver attractive and sustainable returns to shareholders across the cycle. It is the Company‚Äôs present intention for any repurchased ordinary shares to be cancelled and the Share Repurchase Programme is expected to complete by no later than 15 March 2024. The Directors regard having the flexibility to repurchase issued shares in suitable circumstances as an important part of the financial management of the Company. The Directors may consider exercising the authority to purchase the Company‚Äôs ordinary shares if market conditions and the Company‚Äôs financial position make this possible but will keep the matter under review. Shares would only be purchased if the Directors believed that to do so would result in an improvement in earnings per share and would be in the interests of shareholders generally. Any purchases of ordinary shares would be by means of market purchases on a recognised investment exchange and purchased shares would be cancelled (in which case the number of shares in issue would thereby be reduced) or  alternatively  held in treasury  depending on which course of action is considered by the Directors to be in the best interests of the shareholders at that time. RESOLUTION 14: Notice of general meetings (special resolution)The statutory notice period required for general meetings of the Company is at least 21 clear days unless shareholders approve a shorter notice period  which cannot  however  be less than 14 clear days (AGMs will continue to be held on at least 21 clear days‚Äô notice). At last year‚Äôs AGM  shareholders passed a resolution enabling the Company to call general meetings  other than an AGM  on at least 14 clear days‚Äô notice. This approval must be renewed at each AGM  so  in order to preserve this ability  Resolution 14 seeks such approval. It is intended that the shorter notice period would not be used as a matter of routine for such meetings but only where the flexibility is merited by the business of the meeting and is thought to be in the interests of shareholders as a whole. If given  the approval will be effective until the Company‚Äôs next AGM  when it is intended that a similar resolution will be proposed. NOTES 1. The Company strongly encourages all shareholders to submit a proxy vote in advance of the AGM  appointing the Chairman of the meeting as their proxy rather than a named person. These notes to the Notice should be read in this context. 2. Only persons entered on the Register of Members of the Company at 6.30 pm on Tuesday  9 May 2023 (or  if the AGM is adjourned  at 6.30 pm on the date which is two business days prior to the adjourned meeting) shall be entitled to attend and vote at the AGM oradjourned meeting. Changes to entries on the Register of Members after this time shall be disregarded in determining the rights of persons to attend or vote (and the number of votes they may cast) at the AGM or adjourned meeting. 3. A shareholder entitled to attend and vote at the AGM may appoint another person as her/his proxy to exercise all or any of her/his rights to attend  speak and vote at the AGM. A shareholder can appoint more than one proxy in relation to the AGM  provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share or shares held by that shareholder. 4. A proxy does not need to be a shareholder of the Company but must attend the AGM to represent you. Your proxy could be the Chairman or another person who has agreed to attend to represent you. If you wish for a proxy to make any comments on your behalf at the AGM  you will need to appoint someone other than the Chairman of the meeting and give them the relevant instructions directly. Those submitting a Form of Proxy are strongly encouraged to appoint the Chairman of the meeting rather than a named person as their proxy. This will ensure that your vote will be counted even if ultimately you (or any other proxy you might otherwise appoint) are not able to attend the meeting. The valid appointment of a proxy does not prevent you from attending the AGM and voting in person. 5. A shareholder who wishes to appoint a proxy should complete the Form of Proxy which accompanies this notice and includes full details of how to appoint a proxy. If you do not have a Form of Proxy and believe that you should have one  or if you require additional Forms of Proxy  please contact Equiniti‚Äôs helpline on 0371 384 2701 (+44 (0) 371 384 2701 if calling from overseas). Lines are open between 8.30 am and 5.30 pm Monday to Friday (excluding public holidays in England and Wales). Shareholders who hold their shares in uncertificated form may use ‚Äòthe CREST voting service‚Äô to appoint a proxy electronically  as explained below. 6. In order to be valid  a proxy appointment must be returned (together with any power of attorney or other authority under which it is executed or a copy of the authority certified in ink by a bank  a stockbroker or a solicitor) by one of the following methods: ‚Äì in hard copy form by post  by courier or by hand to the Company‚Äôs registrar at the address shown on the Form of Proxy; or in the case of CREST members  by utilising the CREST voting service in accordance with the procedures set out in note 9 below. The appointment of a proxy in each case must formally be received by the Company‚Äôs registrar no later than 11 am on Tuesday  9 May 2023. You may also appoint your proxy electronically online at www.sharevote.co.uk where full instructions on the procedure are given. The Voting ID  Task ID and Shareholder Reference Number printed on the Form of Proxy will be required to use this electronic proxy appointment system. Alternatively  shareholders who have already registered with Equiniti Registrars‚Äô online portfolio service  Shareview  can appoint their proxy electronically by logging on to their portfolio at www.shareview.co.uk using their user ID and password. Once logged in  click ‚Äòview‚Äô on the ‚ÄòMy Investments‚Äô page. Click on the link to vote and follow the on screen instructions. 7. To change your proxy instructions you may return a new proxy appointment using the methods set out above. Where you have appointed a proxy using the hard copy Form of Proxy and would like to change the instructions using another hard copy Form of Proxy  please contact Equiniti at Aspect House  Spencer Road  Lancing  West Sussex BN99 8LU. The deadline for receipt of proxy appointments (see above) also applies in relation to amended instructions. Any attempt to terminate or amend a proxy appointment received after the relevant deadline will be disregarded. Where two or more valid but differing appointments of proxy are delivered or (in the case of appointments in electronic form) received in respect of the same share for use at the same meeting  the one which is last delivered or  as the case may be  received as aforesaid (regardless of its date  its date of sending or the date of its execution) shall be treated as replacing and revoking the other or others as regards that share. If the Company is unable to determine either which is last sent or which is last delivered or received  none of them shall be treated as valid in respect of the relevant share(s).In the case of joint holders  where more than one of the joint holders purports to appoint a proxy  only the appointment submitted by the most senior holder will be accepted. Seniority is determined by the order in which the names of the joint holders appear in the Company‚Äôs register of members in respect of the joint holding (the first-named being the most senior). 8. A copy of this notice has been sent for information only  to Nominated Persons (that is  a person who has been nominated by a shareholder to enjoy information rights under section 146 of the Companies Act 2006). The rights to appoint a proxy cannot be exercised by a Nominated Person; they can only be exercised by a shareholder. However  a Nominated Person may have a right under an agreement with the shareholder by whom she or he was nominated to be appointed as a proxy for the AGM or to have someone else so appointed. If a Nominated Person does not have such a right or does not wish to exercise it  she or he may have a right under such an agreement to give instructions to the shareholder as to the exercise of voting rights. 9. CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies by utilising the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so by utilising the procedures described in the CREST Manual  which can be viewed at www.euroclear.com. CREST personal members or other CREST sponsored members  and those CREST members who have appointed a voting service provider(s)  should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s)  who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf. In order for a proxy appointment made by means of CREST to be valid  the appropriate CREST message (a CREST Proxy Instruction) must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear‚Äôs specifications and must contain the information required for such instructions  as described in the CREST Manual. The message  regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or an amendment to the instruction given to a previously appointed proxy must  in order to be valid  be transmitted so as to be received by the issuer‚Äôs agent (ID number RA19) by 11 am on Tuesday  9 May 2023 (the latest time(s) for receipt of proxy appointments specified in this notice). For this purpose  the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Applications Host) from which the issuer‚Äôs agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001. 10. CREST members and  where applicable  their CREST sponsors or voting service providers should note that Euroclear does not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or  if the CREST member is a CREST personal member or sponsored member or has appointed a voting service provider(s)  to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection  CREST members and  where applicable  their CREST sponsors or voting service providers are referred  in particular  to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings. 11. Voting on all Resolutions will be conducted by way of a poll rather than a show of hands. This is a more transparent method of voting as shareholders‚Äô votes (including the votes of those shareholders who are unable to attend but who have appointed a proxy for the meeting) are to be counted according to the number of shares held. As soon as practicable  following the AGM  the results of the voting will be announced via a Regulatory Information Service and also placed on the Company‚Äôs website: osb.co.uk/investors/shareholder-services/. 12. Please note that the Company takes all reasonable precautions to ensure that no viruses are present in any electronic communication it sends out but the Company cannot accept responsibility for loss or damage arising from the opening or use of any email or attachments from the Company and recommends that shareholders subject all messages to virus checking procedures prior to use. Any electronic communication received by the Company  including the lodgment of an electronic proxy form  that is found to contain any virus will not be accepted. 13. A shareholder of the Company  that is a corporation  may authorise a person or persons to act as its representative(s) at the AGM. In accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006  each such representative may exercise (on behalf of the corporation) the same powers as the corporation could exercise if it were an individual shareholder of the Company  provided that they do not do so in relation to the same shares. 14. Shareholders satisfying the thresholds in section 527 of the Companies Act 2006 can require the Company to publish a statement on its website setting out any matter relating to the audit of the Company‚Äôs accounts (including the Auditor‚Äôs report and the conduct of the audit) that are to be laid before the AGM and that the shareholders propose to raise at the AGM. The Company may not require the shareholders requesting the publication to pay its expenses. Any statement placed on the website must also be sent to the Company‚Äôs Auditor no later than the time it makes its statement available on the website. The business which may be dealt with at the AGM includes any statement that the Company has been required to publish on its website. 15. Under section 319A of the Companies Act 2006  the Company must  subject to limited exceptions  answer any question relating to the business being dealt with at the AGM which is put by a shareholder attending the AGM. Information relating to the AGM which the Company is required by the Companies Act 2006 to publish on a website in advance of the meeting may be viewed at osb.co.uk/investors/ shareholder-services/. You may not use any electronic address provided in this notice to communicate with the Company for any purposes other than those expressly stated. 16. Shareholders have the right to ask questions in relation to the business of the AGM but no answer need be given if (a) to do so would interfere unduly with the preparation for the AGM or involve the disclosure of confidential information  (b) the answer has already been given on a website in the form of an answer to a question  or (c) it is undesirable in the interests of the Company or the good order of the AGM that the question be answered. Shareholders wishing to raise any questions relating to the business of the AGM may do so by submitting them to the Company Secretariat ahead of the AGM at company.secretariat@osb.co.uk. You may submit questions until 11 am on Tuesday  9 May 2023 and the Company will endeavour to publish and maintain an appropriate summary of responses on the ‚ÄòAGM Information‚Äô page of its website in advance of the AGM. 17. Shareholders have the right to request  in accordance with section 360BA of the Companies Act 2006  information to enable them to determine that their vote on a poll was validly recorded and counted. Shareholders who wish to do so should contact Equiniti by phone on 0371 384 2701 (+44 (0) 371 384 2701 if calling from overseas) or by post at Aspect House  Spencer Road  Lancing  West Sussex BN99 8LU  in each case no later than 30 days following the date of this year‚Äôs AGM. 18. As at 23 March 2023 (being the latest practicable date before the publication of this document)  the Company‚Äôs issued share capital consisted of 430 243 748 ordinary shares  carrying one vote each.

March 31  2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Bank of America Corporation   BofA Finance LLC and certain other BAC-affiliated issuers have issued and outstanding certain floating or fixed-to-floating rate debt securities  preferred st‚Ä¶,"CHARLOTTE  N.C.  March 31  2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Bank of America Corporation (""BAC"") (NYSE: BAC)  BofA Finance LLC (""BofA Finance"") and certain other BAC-affiliated issuers have issued and outstanding certain floating or fixed-to-floating rate debt securities  preferred stock represented by depositary shares and trust preferred securities  listed in the Annexes to this press release  that are governed by New York or Delaware law  for which U.S. dollar LIBOR (""USD LIBOR"")  for one- or three-month tenors  serves as the benchmark rate used in connection with the calculation or determination of applicable interest  dividend or distribution payments (the ""USD LIBOR Securities""). On March 5  2021  the U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority announced that after June 30  2023  USD LIBOR for such tenors (along with other remaining tenors of USD LIBOR) would cease publication or no longer be representative. In connection with the cessation of representative USD LIBOR  on March 15  2022  Congress enacted the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (the ""LIBOR Act"")  and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the ""Board"") has issued final rules thereunder (the ""LIBOR Rule"").BAC is issuing this press release to announce its expectation that  on the first London banking date after June 30  2023 (the ""LIBOR Replacement Date"")  the CME Term SOFR Reference Rate published for the one- or three-month tenor (that corresponds to the applicable USD LIBOR tenor)  as administered by CME Group Benchmark Administration  Ltd. (or any successor administrator thereof) (""CME Term SOFR"")  plus the applicable tenor spread adjustment described below (such rate being the ""Board-selected benchmark replacement"" under the LIBOR Rule) will be the reference rate for calculations or determinations of applicable interest  dividend or distribution payments for each of the USD LIBOR Securities listed in the Annexes to this press release. The replacement of USD LIBOR as the benchmark rate for each of the USD LIBOR Securities  with CME Term SOFR for the applicable corresponding tenor  plus the applicable tenor spread adjustment  will be effective for determinations under the terms of the USD LIBOR Securities that are made on and after the LIBOR Replacement Date  but will not affect any determinations made prior to the LIBOR Replacement Date.Non-Workable Contractual FallbacksThe USD LIBOR Securities listed in Annex 1 to this press release  contain fallback provisions that provide for (i) a poll or inquiries for quotes or information related to USD LIBOR or (ii) benchmark replacements based on USD LIBOR values (such as the most recently available USD LIBOR rate or USD LIBOR rate as determined by the calculation agent using discretion). Under the LIBOR Act and LIBOR Rule  on the LIBOR Replacement Date  by operation of law (i) these fallback provisions will be disregarded and deemed null and void and without any force or effect  and (ii) USD LIBOR will be replaced as the benchmark rate by CME Term SOFR for the tenor that corresponds to the applicable USD LIBOR tenor  plus the applicable tenor spread adjustment.Determining Person DiscretionThe USD LIBOR Securities listed in Annex 2 to this press release contain fallback provisions authorizing an investment bank of national or international standing  as applicable  to select the benchmark replacement rate for three-month USD LIBOR. Under the LIBOR Act and the LIBOR Rule  such investment bank is the person with the sole authority under the terms of these USD LIBOR Securities to determine a benchmark replacement for USD LIBOR (referred to in the LIBOR Act and LIBOR Rule as the ""determining person""). For each of these USD LIBOR Securities  BAC and BofA Finance  as issuers of such securities  have appointed BofA Securities  Inc. as the determining person  and it has selected three-month CME Term SOFR  plus the applicable tenor spread adjustment  as the benchmark replacement for three-month USD LIBOR on and after the LIBOR Replacement Date.ARRC Recommended Fallback ProvisionsThe USD LIBOR Securities listed in Annex 3 to this press release contain fallback provisions for three-month USD LIBOR substantially in the form recommended on April 25  2019 by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (""ARRC"") convened by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. For each of these USD LIBOR Securities  in accordance with these fallback provisions  it is expected that USD LIBOR will be replaced as the benchmark rate by CME Term SOFR for the applicable tenor  plus the applicable tenor spread adjustment  on and after the USD LIBOR Replacement Date  if BAC  as issuer  determines that a benchmark transition event and the related benchmark replacement date (as such terms are defined in such securities) have occurred and an interpolated rate (as such term is defined in such securities) cannot be determined. BAC  as issuer of these USD LIBOR Securities  expects these conditions to be satisfied on and after the LIBOR Replacement Date  such that three-month CME Term SOFR  plus the applicable tenor spread adjustment  will replace three-month USD LIBOR for each of these Annex 3 USD LIBOR Securities on and after the LIBOR Replacement Date in the same manner as described above for the Annex 1 and Annex 2 USD LIBOR Securities.Tenor Spread AdjustmentThe tenor spread adjustment for CME Term SOFR with respect to the following tenors of USD LIBOR  as set forth in the LIBOR Act and the LIBOR Rule  is:Tenor Tenor spread adjustment One Month 0.11448 % Three Months 0.26161 %Conforming ChangesFor the USD LIBOR Securities for which the Board-selected benchmark replacement becomes the benchmark replacement for USD LIBOR by operation of law under the LIBOR Act (the USD LIBOR Securities listed in Annex 1) or because selected as such by a determining person (the USD LIBOR Securities listed in Annex 2)  the LIBOR Rule provides that certain benchmark replacement conforming changes will become an integral part of such securities by operation of law. See Annex 4 for a description of such conforming changes. In addition  a person responsible for calculating or determining any valuation  payment or other measurement based on a benchmark (a ""calculating person"") has the authority under the LIBOR Act and the LIBOR Rule to make certain additional benchmark replacement conforming changes (in addition to those specified in LIBOR Rule) under securities such as the USD LIBOR Securities listed in Annex 1 and Annex 2 without any requirement to obtain consent from any other person. Any such additional changes that the applicable calculating person makes with respect to such USD LIBOR Securities will become an integral part of the applicable securities by operation of law and be the subject of a separate announcement on the Investors/Fixed Income portion of BAC's website.Under the terms of the USD LIBOR Securities listed in Annex 3  BAC  as issuer  will have the right to make benchmark replacement conforming changes. It is expected that BAC will determine that the benchmark replacement conforming changes adopted by the Board under the LIBOR Rule will also apply to such USD LIBOR Securities. If BAC makes any additional benchmark replacement conforming changes with respect to such USD LIBOR Securities  such additional changes will be the subject of a separate announcement on the Investors/Fixed Income portion of BAC's website.This press release applies only to the USD LIBOR Securities listed in the Annexes to this press release and does not relate to any other securities or other instruments. In advance of the LIBOR Replacement Date  further notices relating to CME Term SOFR as the benchmark replacement rate for USD LIBOR for the USD LIBOR Securities held through The Depository Trust Company (""DTC"") will be made pursuant to the DTC LIBOR Replacement Index Communication Tool.Forward-Looking StatementsCertain statements contained in this press release may constitute ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements made in this press release include  without limitation  statements concerning the expected transition of the Annex 3 USD LIBOR Securities to CME Term SOFR for the applicable tenor  plus the applicable spread adjustment.

March 31  2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Bank of America Corporation (""BAC"") (NYSE: BAC)  BofA Finance LLC (""BofA Finance"") and certain other BAC-affiliated issuers have issued and outstanding certain floating or fixed-to-floating rate debt securities ‚Ä¶","CHARLOTTE  N.C.  March 31  2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Bank of America Corporation (""BAC"") (NYSE: BAC)  BofA Finance LLC (""BofA Finance"") and certain other BAC-affiliated issuers have issued and outstanding certain floating or fixed-to-floating rate debt securities  preferred stock represented by depositary shares and trust preferred securities  listed in the Annexes to this press release  that are governed by New York or Delaware law  for which U.S. dollar LIBOR (""USD LIBOR"")  for one- or three-month tenors  serves as the benchmark rate used in connection with the calculation or determination of applicable interest  dividend or distribution payments (the ""USD LIBOR Securities""). On March 5  2021  the U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority announced that after June 30  2023  USD LIBOR for such tenors (along with other remaining tenors of USD LIBOR) would cease publication or no longer be representative. In connection with the cessation of representative USD LIBOR  on March 15  2022  Congress enacted the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (the ""LIBOR Act"")  and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the ""Board"") has issued final rules thereunder (the ""LIBOR Rule"").BAC is issuing this press release to announce its expectation that  on the first London banking date after June 30  2023 (the ""LIBOR Replacement Date"")  the CME Term SOFR Reference Rate published for the one- or three-month tenor (that corresponds to the applicable USD LIBOR tenor)  as administered by CME Group Benchmark Administration  Ltd. (or any successor administrator thereof) (""CME Term SOFR"")  plus the applicable tenor spread adjustment described below (such rate being the ""Board-selected benchmark replacement"" under the LIBOR Rule) will be the reference rate for calculations or determinations of applicable interest  dividend or distribution payments for each of the USD LIBOR Securities listed in the Annexes to this press release. The replacement of USD LIBOR as the benchmark rate for each of the USD LIBOR Securities  with CME Term SOFR for the applicable corresponding tenor  plus the applicable tenor spread adjustment  will be effective for determinations under the terms of the USD LIBOR Securities that are made on and after the LIBOR Replacement Date  but will not affect any determinations made prior to the LIBOR Replacement Date.Non-Workable Contractual FallbacksThe USD LIBOR Securities listed in Annex 1 to this press release  contain fallback provisions that provide for (i) a poll or inquiries for quotes or information related to USD LIBOR or (ii) benchmark replacements based on USD LIBOR values (such as the most recently available USD LIBOR rate or USD LIBOR rate as determined by the calculation agent using discretion). Under the LIBOR Act and LIBOR Rule  on the LIBOR Replacement Date  by operation of law (i) these fallback provisions will be disregarded and deemed null and void and without any force or effect  and (ii) USD LIBOR will be replaced as the benchmark rate by CME Term SOFR for the tenor that corresponds to the applicable USD LIBOR tenor  plus the applicable tenor spread adjustment.Determining Person DiscretionThe USD LIBOR Securities listed in Annex 2 to this press release contain fallback provisions authorizing an investment bank of national or international standing  as applicable  to select the benchmark replacement rate for three-month USD LIBOR. Under the LIBOR Act and the LIBOR Rule  such investment bank is the person with the sole authority under the terms of these USD LIBOR Securities to determine a benchmark replacement for USD LIBOR (referred to in the LIBOR Act and LIBOR Rule as the ""determining person""). For each of these USD LIBOR Securities  BAC and BofA Finance  as issuers of such securities  have appointed BofA Securities  Inc. as the determining person  and it has selected three-month CME Term SOFR  plus the applicable tenor spread adjustment  as the benchmark replacement for three-month USD LIBOR on and after the LIBOR Replacement Date.ARRC Recommended Fallback ProvisionsThe USD LIBOR Securities listed in Annex 3 to this press release contain fallback provisions for three-month USD LIBOR substantially in the form recommended on April 25  2019 by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (""ARRC"") convened by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. For each of these USD LIBOR Securities  in accordance with these fallback provisions  it is expected that USD LIBOR will be replaced as the benchmark rate by CME Term SOFR for the applicable tenor  plus the applicable tenor spread adjustment  on and after the USD LIBOR Replacement Date  if BAC  as issuer  determines that a benchmark transition event and the related benchmark replacement date (as such terms are defined in such securities) have occurred and an interpolated rate (as such term is defined in such securities) cannot be determined. BAC  as issuer of these USD LIBOR Securities  expects these conditions to be satisfied on and after the LIBOR Replacement Date  such that three-month CME Term SOFR  plus the applicable tenor spread adjustment  will replace three-month USD LIBOR for each of these Annex 3 USD LIBOR Securities on and after the LIBOR Replacement Date in the same manner as described above for the Annex 1 and Annex 2 USD LIBOR Securities.Tenor Spread AdjustmentThe tenor spread adjustment for CME Term SOFR with respect to the following tenors of USD LIBOR  as set forth in the LIBOR Act and the LIBOR Rule  is:Tenor Tenor spread adjustment One Month 0.11448 % Three Months 0.26161 %Conforming ChangesFor the USD LIBOR Securities for which the Board-selected benchmark replacement becomes the benchmark replacement for USD LIBOR by operation of law under the LIBOR Act (the USD LIBOR Securities listed in Annex 1) or because selected as such by a determining person (the USD LIBOR Securities listed in Annex 2)  the LIBOR Rule provides that certain benchmark replacement conforming changes will become an integral part of such securities by operation of law. See Annex 4 for a description of such conforming changes. In addition  a person responsible for calculating or determining any valuation  payment or other measurement based on a benchmark (a ""calculating person"") has the authority under the LIBOR Act and the LIBOR Rule to make certain additional benchmark replacement conforming changes (in addition to those specified in LIBOR Rule) under securities such as the USD LIBOR Securities listed in Annex 1 and Annex 2 without any requirement to obtain consent from any other person. Any such additional changes that the applicable calculating person makes with respect to such USD LIBOR Securities will become an integral part of the applicable securities by operation of law and be the subject of a separate announcement on the Investors/Fixed Income portion of BAC's website.Under the terms of the USD LIBOR Securities listed in Annex 3  BAC  as issuer  will have the right to make benchmark replacement conforming changes. It is expected that BAC will determine that the benchmark replacement conforming changes adopted by the Board under the LIBOR Rule will also apply to such USD LIBOR Securities. If BAC makes any additional benchmark replacement conforming changes with respect to such USD LIBOR Securities  such additional changes will be the subject of a separate announcement on the Investors/Fixed Income portion of BAC's website.This press release applies only to the USD LIBOR Securities listed in the Annexes to this press release and does not relate to any other securities or other instruments. In advance of the LIBOR Replacement Date  further notices relating to CME Term SOFR as the benchmark replacement rate for USD LIBOR for the USD LIBOR Securities held through The Depository Trust Company (""DTC"") will be made pursuant to the DTC LIBOR Replacement Index Communication Tool.Forward-Looking StatementsCertain statements contained in this press release may constitute ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Key target indications for the platforms include Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD)  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) and high-risk tibial fractures and other orthopedics indications  such as osteoarthritis  by combining new and tested  IP protected  techniques.Following the merger in October 2022  BioSenic combines the strategic positionings and strengths of Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics. The merger also enables Biosenic to add to its innovative cell therapy platform and strong IP for tissue repair or protection with an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/OATO.BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.Story continuesAbout BioSenic technology platformsBioSenic‚Äôs technology is based on two main platforms:1) The allogeneic cell and gene therapy platform  developed by BioSenic with differentiated bone marrow sourced Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) that can be stored at the point of use in hospitals. Its current investigational medicinal product  ALLOB  represents a unique  proprietary approach to organ repair and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells on the site of injury after a single local injection. These cells are produced via a BioSenic's scalable manufacturing process. Following the CTA approval by regulatory authorities in Europe  BioSenic has initiated patient recruitment for the Phase IIb clinical trial with ALLOB in patients with difficult tibial fractures  using its optimized production process. ALLOB is currently being evaluated in a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase IIb study in patients with high-risk tibial fractures  using its optimized production process  after a successful first safety and efficacy study (Phase 1/2a) on fractured long bones  with late delayed union. The patient recruitment has been halted late February 2023 with 57 patients and the new rules permitted for statistical analysis should allow BioSenic to get the main results of this trial much earlier than anticipated in the original protocol  since they are expected by mid-2023.2) The Arsenic TriOxide (ATO) platform developed by Medsenic. The immunomodulatory properties of ATO have demonstrated a double basic effect on cells of the immune system. The first effect is the increase of the cell oxidative stress in activated B  T or other cells of the innate/adaptative immune system to the point they will enter a cell death program (apoptosis) and be eliminated. The second effect is potent immunomodulatory properties on several pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in inflammatory or autoimmune cell pathways. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. GvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). GvHD is primarily mediated by the transplanted immune system that can lead to severe multiorgan damage. Medsenic had been successful in a Phase II trial with its intravenous formulation  allowing arsenic trioxide to be granted an orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA and is heading towards an international Phase III confirmatory study  with a new  IP protected  oral (OATO) formulation.Moderate to Severe forms of Systemic Lupus erythematosus (SLE) is another selected target  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastro-intestinal tract) in a Phase IIa study.Systemic Sclerosis is  in addition  part of the clinical pipeline of BioSenic. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive. This gives good grounds to launch a Phase II clinical protocol for this serious disease that badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and with no actual current effective treatment.In addition  BioSenic is developing an off-the-shelf next-generation improved viscosupplement  JTA-004  consisting of a unique combination of plasma proteins  hyaluronic acid - a natural component of knee synovial fluid  and a fast-acting analgesic. JTA-004 intends to provide added lubrication and protection to the cartilage of the arthritic joint and to alleviate osteoarthritic pain (OA) and inflammation. In March 2023  after the identification of new OA subtypes  BioSenic delivered a new post-hoc analysis of its Phase III JTA-004 trial on knee OA with positive action on the most severely affected patient population. This new post-hoc analysis changes the therapeutic profile of the molecule and potentially allows for the possibility of stratifying patients for a new  optimized Phase III clinical study. BioSenic  which does not intend to allocate R&D resources to support the clinical development of JTA-004 and will continue to focus its R&D activities on the development of its autoimmune (ATO) and cell therapy (ALLOB) platforms  is now seeking to collaborate with existing and potential partners to explore options for the future development of JTA-004 based on this new post-hoc analysis.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAPr.

Mangualde will become the first Portuguese plant to produce large series fully battery electric cars for the domestic and export markets at launch.The announcement was made during a visit by His Excellency  the President of the Portuguese Republic  Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa  His Excellency  the Prime Minister  Ant√≥nio Costa  and His Excellency  the Minister for the Economy and Maritime Affairs  Ant√≥nio Costa Silva  as part of the Government‚Äôs ‚ÄúPRR (Recovery and Resilience Plan) on the Move‚Äù initiative.Stellantis Mangualde leads one of the mobilizing agendas for business innovation with the ‚ÄúGreenAuto‚Äù project  which brings together a consortium of 37 partner entities  who attended the event  and represents a joint investment of ‚Ç¨119 million.‚ÄúWe are proud to announce that Mangualde will enter a new era with the production of large series of battery electric vans in Portugal to provide indispensable solutions for our business customers ‚Äù said Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares. ‚ÄúLeveraging Mangualde‚Äôs manufacturing expertise to build battery electric vehicles is critical to the continued decarbonization of our fleets and a further step as we work to achieve a 40% zero emissions mix by the end of the decade.‚ÄùStory continuesIn 2022  Stellantis was the light commercial vehicle BEV market leader in Europe with nearly 43% market share. In Portugal  the Company was the leader in 2022 in BEV sales  with 22% share  and in the sale of electric commercial vehicles with a 54% market share.Evolution of Mangualde Production CenterThe Stellantis plant in Mangualde  which last year celebrated its 60th anniversary and was the first auto assembly plant in Portugal  has produced more than 1.5 million vehicles to date. Nearly one in every four vehicles produced in Portugal comes from the Mangualde production line. It launched production of the current generation of vehicles in 2018.This announcement ensures the future of the plant and confirms the importance of this manufacturing site for the Portuguese economy  Gross Domestic Product and Exports  as well as for employment and the development of the business and industrial fabric of this region.This new era of production will see a transformation of the Mangualde plant ‚Äúfit for the future‚Äù with new facilities  both in general assembly as well as in the body shop  the optimization of the industrial area  and the creation of a new battery assembly line. The Company has invested in modernizing and updating its facilities and production processes  while also increasingly stressing its commitment to the environment and to reducing emissions  in addition to a strong commitment to innovation.In support of the Stellantis goal of being carbon net zero by 2038  the Mangualde plant completed the second phase of its solar energy park. When concluded  the solar park will provide up to 31% of the plant‚Äôs annual electricity needs  displacing 2 500 tons of CO2 emissions a year  equivalent to the CO2 capturing performance of about 16 000 trees. The facility is aiming for more projects in green energy and energy storage  including one in collaboration with the Municipality of Mangualde and nearby companies that can also benefit from capturing this renewable energy.The plant currently produces light commercial vehicles and passenger versions of the Citro√´n Berlingo/Berlingo Van  Fiat Dobl√≤  Opel Combo/Combo Cargo  and Peugeot Partner/Rifter.Stellantis is investing more than ‚Ç¨30 billion through 2025 in electrification and software to deliver BEVs that meet customer demands.The decision is a key component of the Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan  which is led by deep emission cuts to slash CO2 in half by 2030  benchmarking 2021 metrics  and achieve carbon net zero by 2038 with single digit percentage compensation of the remaining emissions. Core targets for Dare Forward 2030 also include 100% of passenger car sales in Europe and 50% of passenger car and light-duty truck sales in the United States to be BEVs by the end of the decade; the ambition of doubling Net Revenues by 2030 (versus 2021) and sustaining double-digit Adjusted Operating Income margins throughout the decade; and the aim to become number one in customer satisfaction for products and services in every market by 2030.# # #About StellantisStellantis N.V.

Key target indications for the platforms include Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD)  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) and high-risk tibial fractures and other orthopedics indications  such as osteoarthritis  by combining new and tested  IP protected  techniques.Following the merger in October 2022  BioSenic combines the strategic positionings and strengths of Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics. The merger also enables Biosenic to add to its innovative cell therapy platform and strong IP for tissue repair or protection with an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/OATO.BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About BioSenic technology platformsBioSenic‚Äôs technology is based on two main platforms:1) The allogeneic cell and gene therapy platform  developed by BioSenic with differentiated bone marrow sourced Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) that can be stored at the point of use in hospitals. Its current investigational medicinal product  ALLOB  represents a unique  proprietary approach to organ repair and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells on the site of injury after a single local injection. These cells are produced via a BioSenic's scalable manufacturing process. Following the CTA approval by regulatory authorities in Europe  BioSenic has initiated patient recruitment for the Phase IIb clinical trial with ALLOB in patients with difficult tibial fractures  using its optimized production process. ALLOB is currently being evaluated in a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase IIb study in patients with high-risk tibial fractures  using its optimized production process  after a successful first safety and efficacy study (Phase 1/2a) on fractured long bones  with late delayed union. The patient recruitment has been halted late February 2023 with 57 patients and the new rules permitted for statistical analysis should allow BioSenic to get the main results of this trial much earlier than anticipated in the original protocol  since they are expected by mid-2023.2) The Arsenic TriOxide (ATO) platform developed by Medsenic. The immunomodulatory properties of ATO have demonstrated a double basic effect on cells of the immune system. The first effect is the increase of the cell oxidative stress in activated B  T or other cells of the innate/adaptative immune system to the point they will enter a cell death program (apoptosis) and be eliminated. The second effect is potent immunomodulatory properties on several pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in inflammatory or autoimmune cell pathways. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. GvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). GvHD is primarily mediated by the transplanted immune system that can lead to severe multiorgan damage. Medsenic had been successful in a Phase II trial with its intravenous formulation  allowing arsenic trioxide to be granted an orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA and is heading towards an international Phase III confirmatory study  with a new  IP protected  oral (OATO) formulation.Moderate to Severe forms of Systemic Lupus erythematosus (SLE) is another selected target  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastro-intestinal tract) in a Phase IIa study.Systemic Sclerosis is  in addition  part of the clinical pipeline of BioSenic. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive. This gives good grounds to launch a Phase II clinical protocol for this serious disease that badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and with no actual current effective treatment.In addition  BioSenic is developing an off-the-shelf next-generation improved viscosupplement  JTA-004  consisting of a unique combination of plasma proteins  hyaluronic acid - a natural component of knee synovial fluid  and a fast-acting analgesic. JTA-004 intends to provide added lubrication and protection to the cartilage of the arthritic joint and to alleviate osteoarthritic pain (OA) and inflammation. In March 2023  after the identification of new OA subtypes  BioSenic delivered a new post-hoc analysis of its Phase III JTA-004 trial on knee OA with positive action on the most severely affected patient population. This new post-hoc analysis changes the therapeutic profile of the molecule and potentially allows for the possibility of stratifying patients for a new  optimized Phase III clinical study. BioSenic  which does not intend to allocate R&D resources to support the clinical development of JTA-004 and will continue to focus its R&D activities on the development of its autoimmune (ATO) and cell therapy (ALLOB) platforms  is now seeking to collaborate with existing and potential partners to explore options for the future development of JTA-004 based on this new post-hoc analysis.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAPr.

To receive the designation  a device must also have either breakthrough technology  or no approved or cleared alternatives  or significant advantages over existing approved or cleared alternatives  or its availability must be in the best interest of patients.Under the program  Pixium Vision will have the opportunity to interact with the FDA's experts during the premarket review phase of the Prima System to identify areas of agreement in a timely way and could also receive prioritized review of the regulatory submission.Story continues""To receive this Breakthrough Device Designation and have the FDA recognize the therapeutic potential of our Prima System is a significant achievement for Pixium Vision  especially as only a small proportion of devices awarded the designation are intended to treat ophthalmologic conditions1 "" said Lloyd Diamond  Chief Executive Officer of Pixium Vision. ""Our Prima System is making great progress in the clinic with a read-out on the primary endpoints due toward the end of this year. This designation not only helps us to expedite the development of the Prima System but also affords us the opportunity of working closely with the FDA in refining the Prima System for its US regulatory submission. In addition  after receiving market authorization  there are outpatient and inpatient reimbursement pathways that are more readily accessible as a result of receiving Breakthrough Device Designation.""In December 2022  Pixium Vision announced the completion of implantations in the European pivotal trial PRIMAvera and confirmed a read-out of the study's primary endpoints around the end of 2023  with a regulatory submission in Europe in H1 2024.The PRIMAvera study design is based on the positive data generated in a French feasibility study  showing the ability of patients with dry AMD to improve visual acuity with the Prima System. The primary efficacy endpoint of the PRIMAvera study is the proportion of subjects with an improvement of visual acuity of logMAR 0.2 or more from baseline after 12 months  and the primary safety endpoint is the number and severity of device and procedure-related serious adverse events at 12 months follow-up. The study will include three years of follow-up  with an assessment of the primary endpoints at 12 months after implantation.About Pixium VisionPixium Vision is creating a world of bionic vision for those who have lost their sight  enabling them to regain visual perception and greater autonomy.

Mangualde will become the first Portuguese plant to produce large series fully battery electric cars for the domestic and export markets at launch.The announcement was made during a visit by His Excellency  the President of the Portuguese Republic  Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa  His Excellency  the Prime Minister  Ant√≥nio Costa  and His Excellency  the Minister for the Economy and Maritime Affairs  Ant√≥nio Costa Silva  as part of the Government‚Äôs ‚ÄúPRR (Recovery and Resilience Plan) on the Move‚Äù initiative.Stellantis Mangualde leads one of the mobilizing agendas for business innovation with the ‚ÄúGreenAuto‚Äù project  which brings together a consortium of 37 partner entities  who attended the event  and represents a joint investment of ‚Ç¨119 million.‚ÄúWe are proud to announce that Mangualde will enter a new era with the production of large series of battery electric vans in Portugal to provide indispensable solutions for our business customers ‚Äù said Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares. ‚ÄúLeveraging Mangualde‚Äôs manufacturing expertise to build battery electric vehicles is critical to the continued decarbonization of our fleets and a further step as we work to achieve a 40% zero emissions mix by the end of the decade.‚ÄùIn 2022  Stellantis was the light commercial vehicle BEV market leader in Europe with nearly 43% market share. In Portugal  the Company was the leader in 2022 in BEV sales  with 22% share  and in the sale of electric commercial vehicles with a 54% market share.Evolution of Mangualde Production CenterThe Stellantis plant in Mangualde  which last year celebrated its 60th anniversary and was the first auto assembly plant in Portugal  has produced more than 1.5 million vehicles to date. Nearly one in every four vehicles produced in Portugal comes from the Mangualde production line. It launched production of the current generation of vehicles in 2018.This announcement ensures the future of the plant and confirms the importance of this manufacturing site for the Portuguese economy  Gross Domestic Product and Exports  as well as for employment and the development of the business and industrial fabric of this region.This new era of production will see a transformation of the Mangualde plant ‚Äúfit for the future‚Äù with new facilities  both in general assembly as well as in the body shop  the optimization of the industrial area  and the creation of a new battery assembly line. The Company has invested in modernizing and updating its facilities and production processes  while also increasingly stressing its commitment to the environment and to reducing emissions  in addition to a strong commitment to innovation.In support of the Stellantis goal of being carbon net zero by 2038  the Mangualde plant completed the second phase of its solar energy park. When concluded  the solar park will provide up to 31% of the plant‚Äôs annual electricity needs  displacing 2 500 tons of CO2 emissions a year  equivalent to the CO2 capturing performance of about 16 000 trees. The facility is aiming for more projects in green energy and energy storage  including one in collaboration with the Municipality of Mangualde and nearby companies that can also benefit from capturing this renewable energy.The plant currently produces light commercial vehicles and passenger versions of the Citro√´n Berlingo/Berlingo Van  Fiat Dobl√≤  Opel Combo/Combo Cargo  and Peugeot Partner/Rifter.Stellantis is investing more than ‚Ç¨30 billion through 2025 in electrification and software to deliver BEVs that meet customer demands.The decision is a key component of the Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan  which is led by deep emission cuts to slash CO2 in half by 2030  benchmarking 2021 metrics  and achieve carbon net zero by 2038 with single digit percentage compensation of the remaining emissions. Core targets for Dare Forward 2030 also include 100% of passenger car sales in Europe and 50% of passenger car and light-duty truck sales in the United States to be BEVs by the end of the decade; the ambition of doubling Net Revenues by 2030 (versus 2021) and sustaining double-digit Adjusted Operating Income margins throughout the decade; and the aim to become number one in customer satisfaction for products and services in every market by 2030.# # #About StellantisStellantis N.V.

To receive the designation  a device must also have either breakthrough technology  or no approved or cleared alternatives  or significant advantages over existing approved or cleared alternatives  or its availability must be in the best interest of patients.Under the program  Pixium Vision will have the opportunity to interact with the FDA's experts during the premarket review phase of the Prima System to identify areas of agreement in a timely way and could also receive prioritized review of the regulatory submission.""To receive this Breakthrough Device Designation and have the FDA recognize the therapeutic potential of our Prima System is a significant achievement for Pixium Vision  especially as only a small proportion of devices awarded the designation are intended to treat ophthalmologic conditions1 "" said Lloyd Diamond  Chief Executive Officer of Pixium Vision. ""Our Prima System is making great progress in the clinic with a read-out on the primary endpoints due toward the end of this year. This designation not only helps us to expedite the development of the Prima System but also affords us the opportunity of working closely with the FDA in refining the Prima System for its US regulatory submission. In addition  after receiving market authorization  there are outpatient and inpatient reimbursement pathways that are more readily accessible as a result of receiving Breakthrough Device Designation.""In December 2022  Pixium Vision announced the completion of implantations in the European pivotal trial PRIMAvera and confirmed a read-out of the study's primary endpoints around the end of 2023  with a regulatory submission in Europe in H1 2024.The PRIMAvera study design is based on the positive data generated in a French feasibility study  showing the ability of patients with dry AMD to improve visual acuity with the Prima System. The primary efficacy endpoint of the PRIMAvera study is the proportion of subjects with an improvement of visual acuity of logMAR 0.2 or more from baseline after 12 months  and the primary safety endpoint is the number and severity of device and procedure-related serious adverse events at 12 months follow-up. The study will include three years of follow-up  with an assessment of the primary endpoints at 12 months after implantation.About Pixium VisionPixium Vision is creating a world of bionic vision for those who have lost their sight  enabling them to regain visual perception and greater autonomy.

To receive the designation  a device must also have either breakthrough technology  or no approved or cleared alternatives  or significant advantages over existing approved or cleared alternatives  or its availability must be in the best interest of patients.Under the program  Pixium Vision will have the opportunity to interact with the FDA's experts during the premarket review phase of the Prima System to identify areas of agreement in a timely way and could also receive prioritized review of the regulatory submission.""To receive this Breakthrough Device Designation and have the FDA recognize the therapeutic potential of our Prima System is a significant achievement for Pixium Vision  especially as only a small proportion of devices awarded the designation are intended to treat ophthalmologic conditions1 "" said Lloyd Diamond  Chief Executive Officer of Pixium Vision. ""Our Prima System is making great progress in the clinic with a read-out on the primary endpoints due toward the end of this year. This designation not only helps us to expedite the development of the Prima System but also affords us the opportunity of working closely with the FDA in refining the Prima System for its US regulatory submission. In addition  after receiving market authorization  there are outpatient and inpatient reimbursement pathways that are more readily accessible as a result of receiving Breakthrough Device Designation.""In December 2022  Pixium Vision announced the completion of implantations in the European pivotal trial PRIMAvera and confirmed a read-out of the study's primary endpoints around the end of 2023  with a regulatory submission in Europe in H1 2024.The PRIMAvera study design is based on the positive data generated in a French feasibility study  showing the ability of patients with dry AMD to improve visual acuity with the Prima System. The primary efficacy endpoint of the PRIMAvera study is the proportion of subjects with an improvement of visual acuity of logMAR 0.2 or more from baseline after 12 months  and the primary safety endpoint is the number and severity of device and procedure-related serious adverse events at 12 months follow-up. The study will include three years of follow-up  with an assessment of the primary endpoints at 12 months after implantation.About Pixium VisionPixium Vision is creating a world of bionic vision for those who have lost their sight  enabling them to regain visual perception and greater autonomy.

Ten applications at 7-day intervals were made.The combination Leimay¬Æ+ AXP12  tested at a reduced dose of both products  was very efficient on leaves and bunches. It is superior to Leimay¬Æ and AXP12 used alone at their full dose  which could allow a reduction in the dose of either or both products.Moreover  the performance of this mixture is significantly better than the reference product of the trials  copper hydroxide (at the rate of 200 g active ingredient/ha/treatment).These results support the continuation of the experiment in 2023.About AMO√âBA:Amo√©ba's ambition is to become a major player in the treatment of microbiological risk in the water  plant protection and health sectors. Based on the natural properties of the amoeba Willaertia magna C2c Maky  our biological solution is a viable alternative to the chemical products widely used in the industry today. Amoeba is currently focused on the closed system industrial cooling tower market in the United States estimated at ‚Ç¨200 million (1) and on the global biocontrol market for plant protection estimated at ‚Ç¨3 billion (2)  out of a global market for chemical fungicides estimated at ‚Ç¨21 billion (3). The commercialization of the associated biocides and phytosanitary products is subject to local regulatory approvals.*At the end of 2022  Amoeba obtained approval of its active substance for biocidal use in closed cooling system and for biocontrol use in the United States. The substance has also been recommended for biocontrol use in Europe by the Austrian authority in the same year. The company is currently in a pre-commercialization phase for biocidal and plant protection applications and is expected to market its products by 2025. Founded in 2010and based in Chassieu (Lyon  France)  Amo√©ba is listed on Euronext Growth. The Company is a member of the BPI Excellence network and is eligible for the PEA-PME scheme.
