Please see section 10 of the notes to the Notice of the Annual General Meeting.By order of the BoardApex Secretaries LLPCompany Secretary3 April 2023Registered Office:6th Floor125 London WallLondon EC2Y 5ASExplanatory Notes on the resolutionsAn explanation of each of the resolutions is set out below.Resolution 1 - To receive and adopt the Annual Report and AccountsThe Directors are required to present the financial statements  Directors' Report and Auditor's Report to the meeting. These are contained in the Company's Annual Report and Financial Statements for the period ended 31 December 2022 (the ""Annual Report""). A resolution to receive and adopt the financial statements  together with the Directors' Report and the Auditor's Report on those accounts is included as an ordinary resolution.Resolutions 2-6 - Re-election and election of DirectorsIn accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code  all of the Directors will retire and offer themselves for re-election at the forthcoming AGM.The Company has 4 non-executive directors  all of whom are determined by the Board to be independent directors in accordance with the criteria set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code. The Board considers that their skills  experience  independence and knowledge of the Company enable them to discharge their respective duties and responsibilities effectively.Each of the Board members' biographical details can be found on pages 47 to 48 of the Company's Annual Report for the period to 31 December 2022.Resolutions 7 and 8 - Appointment and Remuneration of AuditorAt each meeting at which the Company's financial statements are presented to its members  the Company is required to appoint an auditor to serve until the next such meeting. As part of its review of the continuing appointment of the auditors  the Board considers the length of tenure of the audit firm  its fees and independence along with any matters raised during each audit. Mazars LLP are the appointed auditors of the Company. This year's audit was the third performed by Mazars LLP since their appointment following an audit tender process in 2020. The audit of the period ended 31 December 2022 was the second audit by Mazars since Physitrack PLC became a public company. The Board recommends the re-appointment of Mazars LLP and this will be proposed to the AGM as Resolution 7. Resolution 8 authorises the Directors to determine the remuneration of Mazars LLP as Auditor.Resolution 9 - Authority to allot Ordinary SharesThe Directors may only allot shares or grant rights to subscribe for  or convert any security into  shares if authorised to do so by shareholders. Resolution 9 will  if passed  authorise the Directors to allot the Company's Ordinary Shares or grant rights to subscribe for  or convert any security into  Ordinary Shares in the Company up to a maximum nominal amount of £1 626.08 representing 1 626.078 Ordinary Shares and is equivalent to approximately 10 per cent of the Company's existing issued Ordinary Share capital as at 31 March 2023 (being the latest practicable date prior to publication of the Notice).Resolution 10 - Authority to dis-apply pre-emption rightsResolution 10 is a special resolution which is being proposed to authorise the Directors to disapply the pre-emption rights of existing Shareholders in relation to issues of Ordinary Shares under Resolution 9 (being in respect of ordinary shares up to an aggregate nominal value of £1 626.08  representing up to approximately 10 per cent. of the Company's issued ordinary share capital as at the date of the Notice)  provided that in the case of any Ordinary Shares allotted the issue price is no lower than the nominal value per Ordinary Share.Resolution 11 - Share RepurchasesResolution 11 is also a special resolution. The Companies Act 2006 allows companies to hold shares acquired by way of market purchase as treasury shares  rather than having to cancel them. This would give the Company the ability to re-issue Ordinary Shares quickly and cost effectively thereby improving liquidity and providing the Company with additional flexibility in the management of its capital base.No Ordinary Shares will be sold from treasury at a price less than the net asset value per existing ordinary share at the time of their sale unless they are first offered pro rata to existing Shareholders.The Company may seek to address any significant discount to net asset value at which its Ordinary Shares may be trading by purchasing its own Ordinary Shares in the market on an ad hoc basis.The Directors currently have the authority to make market purchases of up to 10 per cent. of the Ordinary Shares in issue and are seeking to renew this authority to issue up to 10% of the Company's issued share capital  which equates to 1 626.078 at the date of this notice. The maximum price (exclusive of expenses) which may be paid for an ordinary share must not be more than the higher of:(i) 105% of the average of the mid-market values of the Ordinary Shares for the five business days before the purchase is made; or(ii) the price stipulated by the regulatory technical standards adopted by the UK pursuant to the Market Abuse Regulation  being the form of the EU Market Abuse Regulation as incorporated into the law of England and Wales  as amended from time to time.Ordinary Shares will only be repurchased at prices below the prevailing net asset value per ordinary share  which should have the effect of increasing the net asset value per ordinary share for the remaining Shareholders. The minimum price which may be paid shall be their respective nominal values.It is intended that a renewal of the authority to make market purchases will be sought from Shareholders at each AGM of the Company. Purchases of Ordinary Shares will be made within guidelines established from time to time by the Board. Any purchase of Ordinary Shares would be made only out of the available uncommitted cash resources of the Group.Ordinary Shares repurchased by the Company may be held in treasury or cancelled.Investors should note that the repurchase of Ordinary Shares is entirely at the discretion of the Board and no expectation or reliance should be placed on such discretion being exercised on any one or more occasions or as to the proportion of Ordinary Shares that may be repurchased.Settlement of ordinary share transactions in the Company are settled by the CREST share settlement system.The results of the voting on all resolutions will be published on the Company's website as soon as practicable following the conclusion of the AGM.Notes to the Notice of Annual General Meeting1.

Please see section 10 of the notes to the Notice of the Annual General Meeting.By order of the BoardApex Secretaries LLPCompany Secretary3 April 2023Registered Office:6th Floor125 London WallLondon EC2Y 5ASExplanatory Notes on the resolutionsAn explanation of each of the resolutions is set out below.Resolution 1 - To receive and adopt the Annual Report and AccountsThe Directors are required to present the financial statements  Directors' Report and Auditor's Report to the meeting. These are contained in the Company's Annual Report and Financial Statements for the period ended 31 December 2022 (the ""Annual Report""). A resolution to receive and adopt the financial statements  together with the Directors' Report and the Auditor's Report on those accounts is included as an ordinary resolution.Resolutions 2-6 - Re-election and election of DirectorsIn accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code  all of the Directors will retire and offer themselves for re-election at the forthcoming AGM.The Company has 4 non-executive directors  all of whom are determined by the Board to be independent directors in accordance with the criteria set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code. The Board considers that their skills  experience  independence and knowledge of the Company enable them to discharge their respective duties and responsibilities effectively.Each of the Board members' biographical details can be found on pages 47 to 48 of the Company's Annual Report for the period to 31 December 2022.Resolutions 7 and 8 - Appointment and Remuneration of AuditorAt each meeting at which the Company's financial statements are presented to its members  the Company is required to appoint an auditor to serve until the next such meeting. As part of its review of the continuing appointment of the auditors  the Board considers the length of tenure of the audit firm  its fees and independence along with any matters raised during each audit. Mazars LLP are the appointed auditors of the Company. This year's audit was the third performed by Mazars LLP since their appointment following an audit tender process in 2020. The audit of the period ended 31 December 2022 was the second audit by Mazars since Physitrack PLC became a public company. The Board recommends the re-appointment of Mazars LLP and this will be proposed to the AGM as Resolution 7. Resolution 8 authorises the Directors to determine the remuneration of Mazars LLP as Auditor.Resolution 9 - Authority to allot Ordinary SharesThe Directors may only allot shares or grant rights to subscribe for  or convert any security into  shares if authorised to do so by shareholders. Resolution 9 will  if passed  authorise the Directors to allot the Company's Ordinary Shares or grant rights to subscribe for  or convert any security into  Ordinary Shares in the Company up to a maximum nominal amount of £1 626.08 representing 1 626.078 Ordinary Shares and is equivalent to approximately 10 per cent of the Company's existing issued Ordinary Share capital as at 31 March 2023 (being the latest practicable date prior to publication of the Notice).Resolution 10 - Authority to dis-apply pre-emption rightsResolution 10 is a special resolution which is being proposed to authorise the Directors to disapply the pre-emption rights of existing Shareholders in relation to issues of Ordinary Shares under Resolution 9 (being in respect of ordinary shares up to an aggregate nominal value of £1 626.08  representing up to approximately 10 per cent. of the Company's issued ordinary share capital as at the date of the Notice)  provided that in the case of any Ordinary Shares allotted the issue price is no lower than the nominal value per Ordinary Share.Resolution 11 - Share RepurchasesResolution 11 is also a special resolution. The Companies Act 2006 allows companies to hold shares acquired by way of market purchase as treasury shares  rather than having to cancel them. This would give the Company the ability to re-issue Ordinary Shares quickly and cost effectively thereby improving liquidity and providing the Company with additional flexibility in the management of its capital base.No Ordinary Shares will be sold from treasury at a price less than the net asset value per existing ordinary share at the time of their sale unless they are first offered pro rata to existing Shareholders.The Company may seek to address any significant discount to net asset value at which its Ordinary Shares may be trading by purchasing its own Ordinary Shares in the market on an ad hoc basis.The Directors currently have the authority to make market purchases of up to 10 per cent. of the Ordinary Shares in issue and are seeking to renew this authority to issue up to 10% of the Company's issued share capital  which equates to 1 626.078 at the date of this notice. The maximum price (exclusive of expenses) which may be paid for an ordinary share must not be more than the higher of:(i) 105% of the average of the mid-market values of the Ordinary Shares for the five business days before the purchase is made; or(ii) the price stipulated by the regulatory technical standards adopted by the UK pursuant to the Market Abuse Regulation  being the form of the EU Market Abuse Regulation as incorporated into the law of England and Wales  as amended from time to time.Ordinary Shares will only be repurchased at prices below the prevailing net asset value per ordinary share  which should have the effect of increasing the net asset value per ordinary share for the remaining Shareholders. The minimum price which may be paid shall be their respective nominal values.It is intended that a renewal of the authority to make market purchases will be sought from Shareholders at each AGM of the Company. Purchases of Ordinary Shares will be made within guidelines established from time to time by the Board. Any purchase of Ordinary Shares would be made only out of the available uncommitted cash resources of the Group.Ordinary Shares repurchased by the Company may be held in treasury or cancelled.Investors should note that the repurchase of Ordinary Shares is entirely at the discretion of the Board and no expectation or reliance should be placed on such discretion being exercised on any one or more occasions or as to the proportion of Ordinary Shares that may be repurchased.Settlement of ordinary share transactions in the Company are settled by the CREST share settlement system.The results of the voting on all resolutions will be published on the Company's website as soon as practicable following the conclusion of the AGM.Notes to the Notice of Annual General Meeting1.

Clearance of the IND will pave the way for the Company to initiate its randomized controlled Phase 1/2a MOJAVE study in the US  planned for Q2 2023.The IND application includes data from the previously reported GLP animal1 and Phase 1 CHIHUAHUA2 studies supporting the safety and tolerability profile of Sequana Medical's DSR 2.0 product  as well as the strong safety and efficacy data reported from RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies with its first-generation DSR product (DSR 1.0). Additionally  the application also contains manufacturing information of DSR 2.0 and an outline of the MOJAVE study design.Oliver Gödje   Chief Medical Officer of Sequana Medical   commented : “Today's announcement is an important milestone for our DSR program. There are an estimated 200 000 US heart failure patients suffering from diuretic-resistant congestion that requires repeated hospitalization at an estimated cost of $14bn a year  and therefore an urgent need for new therapies such as DSR to alleviate this burden and improve patients' lives. We are very excited to build upon the exciting results from our RED DESERT and SAHARA studies and bring our second generation product  DSR 2.0 into the clinic in the US. We look forward to reporting data from the first US patients later this year.”On track to start MOJAVE with DSR 2.0 in Q2 2023The final study design of the randomized controlled Phase 1/2a MOJAVE study in the US will be communicated upon approval by the FDA and Ethics Committees. Following several initial discussions with the FDA  the intention is to enrol 30 diuretic-resistant chronic heart failure patients with persistent congestion. Of these  20 randomized patients will receive DSR 2.0 administered via a peritoneal catheter on top of usual care for congestive heart failure for up to four weeks and ten randomized patients will receive intravenous loop diuretic treatment as part of maximized usual care for congestive heart failure alone. Following four weeks of treatment  there will be a three-month safety follow-up period. Prior to enrolment of these 30 patients  the intention is for three patients to be enrolled in a non-randomized safety cohort and to receive DSR 2.0 administered via a peritoneal catheter on top of congestive heart failure usual care for up to four weeks. Advancing to the enrolment of the 30 randomized patients is anticipated to be dependent upon DSMB3 approval following their review of the initial three patients.For more information  please contact:Sequana MedicalLies VannesteDirector Investor RelationsE:T: +32 (0)498 053579Optimum Strategic CommunicationsNick Bastin  Jonathan Edwards  Vici RabbettsE:T: +44 (0) 208 078 4357About DSR in congestive heart failureSequana Medical considers its proprietary DSR to be a disease modifying therapy for congestive heart failure. Fluid accumulation in heart failure patients is caused by the retention of too much sodium. The DSR drug-based approach directly tackles this key clinical problem of sodium overload  and works in partnership with the kidneys to safely and rapidly eliminate the excess fluid. Complementary to existing heart failure therapies  clinical proof-of-concept studies using the Company's first-generation DSR product (DSR 1.0) have shown that DSR can i) safely  effectively and rapidly eliminate fluid overload in heart failure patients  ii) improve the health of the heart and preserve renal function  and iii) restore the ability of the kidney to manage the fluid and sodium naturally  resulting in a large and long-lasting reduction in the need for diuretic drugs. In DSR treated patients  there have been no congestion-related re-hospitalizations during the study follow-up period  all patients improved their NYHA status by at least one class and the clinical benefits observed in the clinical studies resulted in a 75% reduction in predicted one-year mortality of patients pre- vs. post-intensive DSR therapy based on the Seattle Heart Failure Model. The Company plans to begin MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled Phase 1/2a clinical trial in Q2 2023.About Sequana MedicalSequana Medical NV is a pioneer in treating fluid overload  a serious and frequent clinical complication in patients with liver disease  heart failure and cancer. These patients can have up to 15 liters of extra fluid in their bodies  causing major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility that severely impacts daily life. Although diuretics are standard of care  the problem is that in many patients they are no longer effective and / or tolerable. There are limited effective treatment options for these patients  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing“diuretic-resistant” patient population.alfa pump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  delivering major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients and reducing costs for healthcare systems. The Company has reported positive primary endpoint data from the North American pivotal POSEIDON trial of the alfa pump in recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis  enabling the filing of a Pre-Market Approval (PMA) application with the FDA  planned for H2 2023. Having delivered clinical proof-of-concept for DSR as a disease-modifying drug program for the treatment of heart failure  the Company is planning to commence MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical trial of DSR 2.0  in Q2 2023.",neutral,0.0,0.85,0.15,mixed,0.2,0.02,0.78,True,English,"['Investigational New Drug', 'Congestive Heart Failure', 'Sequana Medical', 'IND) Application', 'Submission', 'DSR®', 'Treatment', 'US randomized controlled Phase 1/2a clinical trial', 'Lies Vanneste Director Investor Relations', 'controlled Phase 1/2a MOJAVE study', 'Investigational New Drug (IND) application', '30 diuretic-resistant chronic heart failure patients', 'congestive heart failure usual care', 'Seattle Heart Failure Model', 'existing heart failure therapies', 'three-month safety follow-up period', 'intravenous loop diuretic treatment', 'The DSR drug-based approach', '200,000 US heart failure patients', 'study follow-up period', 'Phase 1 CHIHUAHUA2 studies', 'MOJAVE study design', 'final study design', 'frequent clinical complication', 'Oliver Gödje', 'several initial discussions', 'Optimum Strategic Communications', 'randomized safety cohort', 'second generation product', 'ten randomized patients', 'Chief Medical Officer', 'major medical issues', 'Sequana Medica l', 'disease modifying therapy', 'key clinical problem', 'first US patients', 'Sequana Medical NV', 'initial three patients', 'post-intensive DSR therapy', 'up to 15 liters', 'second-generation DSR product', 'first-generation DSR product', 'new therapies', '20 randomized patients', '30 randomized patients', 'Drug Administration', 'diuretic-resistant congestion', 'clinical studies', 'IND application', 'clinical proof', 'clinical benefits', 'diuretic drugs', 'US Food', 'DSR 2.0 product', 'strong safety', 'liver disease', 'The Company', ""patients' lives"", 'many patients', 'concept studies', 'SAHARA studies', 'PRESS RELEASE', 'Euronext Brussels', 'GLP animal1', 'tolerability profile', 'RED DESERT', 'SAHARA proof', 'important milestone', 'repeated hospitalization', 'exciting results', 'Ethics Committees', 'persistent congestion', 'peritoneal catheter', 'four weeks', 'Nick Bastin', 'Jonathan Edwards', 'Vici Rabbetts', 'renal function', 'congestion-related re-hospitalizations', 'NYHA status', 'one class', 'severe pain', 'restricted mobility', 'daily life', 'fluid overload', 'Fluid accumulation', 'excess fluid', 'extra fluid', 'DSR program', 'proprietary DSR', 'manufacturing information', 'urgent need', 'DSMB3 approval', 'long-lasting reduction', 'one-year mortality', 'efficacy data', 'sodium overload', '30 patients', '75% reduction', 'Ghent', 'Belgium', '03 April', 'pioneer', 'cancer', 'FDA', '31 March', 'Clearance', 'way', 'Q2', 'outline', 'announcement', 'cost', 'burden', 'track', 'intention', 'top', 'part', 'enrolment', 'review', 'retention', 'kidneys', 'health', 'large', 'serious', 'bodies', 'increased', 'difficulty', 'breathing', 'diuretics', 'standard', '44']",2023-04-03,2023-04-03,menafn.com
