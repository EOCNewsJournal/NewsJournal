Determination of remuneration for the auditorThe nomination committee proposes that the remuneration to Deloitte Statsautoriseret Revisionspartnerselskab will be paid in accordance with accounts approved by the Company.Re item 11a. Proposal to authorize the board of directors to acquire treasury sharesThe board of directors proposes that the general meeting in the period until the annual general meeting to be held in 2024 authorizes the board of directors to pass a resolution on the acquisition of treasury shares on the following terms:1. The Company may acquire up to nominally 114 989 treasury shares in the period until the annual general meeting to be held in 2024.2. Acquisitions of treasury shares should be made on the Exchange at a price per share which cannot deviate more than 10 % from the price quoted on the Exchange on the date of acquisition.All acquisitions of treasury shares shall be made in accordance with the applicable rules at the Exchange.It is proposed that the authorization to the board of directors to acquire treasury shares will replace the lapsed authorisation in section 4.2 in the articles of association as set out in the draft new articles of association  enclosed as Schedule D.Re item 11b. Proposal to authorize the board of directors to issue warrantsThe board of directors proposes that the general meeting in the period until the annual general meeting to be held in 2024 authorises the board of directors to issue up to 7 158 154 warrants in one or more rounds to the Company's key employees  consultants  members of the management and members of the executive management granting them a right to subscribe for shares of up to a total nominal amount of DKK 71 581.54 against payment in cash without pre-emption rights for the Company's shareholders  and to adopt the necessary resolutions to carry out the required increase of the Company's share capital.The reason for the board of directors' proposal to expand the authorization to issue warrants is that the board of directors considers it crucial to be able to attract  retain and incentivize relevant key employees in the Company.Historically  the authorization to issue warrants has been equal to 6.5% of the outstanding share capital in the Company. Following completion of Tranche 2 (reference is made to page 41 of the annual report for more information on Tranche 2)  the outstanding share capital in the Company will amount to up to 170 448 716 shares  depending on whether or not Tranche 2 is completed at the agreed price of SEK 0.60 per share.Following the dilution that occurred in relation to Tranche 1  and the dilution that will occur in relation to Tranche 2  the board of directors is of the opinion that a warrant pool equal to 6.5% of the Company's outstanding share capital is desirable in order to be able to attract  retain and incentivize new and existing key employees in the Company.The amount of warrants under the authorization has been determined as 6.5% of the Company's outstanding share capital  assuming that Tranche 2 is completed at the agreed price of SEK 0.60 per share less any warrants previously issued by the board of directors (approx. 3.9m). To the extent that Tranche 2 is completed at a higher price  the board of directors will abstain from issuing more 6.5% of the Company's outstanding share capital following Tranche 2.The principal terms and conditions which shall apply to the issued warrants are enclosed as schedule 1 to the articles of association (enclosed as Schedule D to this notice). The board of directors shall be authorized to determine the detailed terms and conditions of the issued warrants and the distribution thereof in accordance with the terms and conditions set out in that schedule.The board of directors may reissue any expired warrants that have not been duly exercised  provided that the reissuance observes the terms and limitations in time which are set out in this authorisation. A reissuance shall mean the board of directors' access to issue new warrants as substitution for warrants that have already been issued but which have terminated.For the issuance of warrants based on the above authorization the following shall apply:1. Partial payment of the subscription amount is not permitted.2. The new shares will be without pre-emption rights for existing shareholders  and the pre-emption rights relating to the new shares will not be restricted in respect of future capital increases.3. The transferability of the new shares will not be restricted  and the new shareholders will not be obligated to let their shares be redeemed.4. The new shares will be issued in the name of the holder and will be negotiable instruments.It is proposed that the authorization to issue warrants will replace authorisation in section 5.1 in the articles of association as set out in the draft new articles of association (schedule D).Re item 11c. Proposal to indemnify the board of directors and executive managementThe board of directors proposes  as a supplement to the Company's directors and officers liability insurance (D&O insurance)  that the Company shall indemnify members of the board of directors and executive management (together the ""Members of Management"" and individually  a ""Member of Management"") against third party claims in connection to such Members of Management's position or employment at the Company. The Company's current D&O insurance has a limit of liability of DKK 25 000 000 per claim and in aggregate per year. The indemnification shall be effective until the annual general meeting to be held in 2024 and shall include both current and future Members of Management. To the extent permitted by applicable Danish law  the indemnification shall apply to any liability towards third parties  which a Member of Management incurs in the performance of its duties as Member of Management of the Company.The Company's indemnification shall however not apply in the event of the respective Member of Management's gross negligence  willful misconduct  or fraudulent actions. Further  the indemnification shall in no event apply to the extent that the claim is covered by the Company's D&O insurance in part or in full. The indemnification shall thus for each Member of Management be limited to the part of a claim that exceeds the insurance coverage available to the respective Member of Management.The indemnification includes (i) the costs of investigating and defending claims by third parties  and (ii) the tax consequences for the individual Member of Management as a result of the indemnification. It is the opinion of the board of directors that it is necessary for the company to indemnify Members of the Management in excess of the coverage on the Company's D&O insurance in order to attract and retain talented and experienced individuals in the management of the Company. Therefore  the proposal is considered to be in the interest of both the Company and its shareholders.Re item 12. Proposal on authorization to the chairman of the meetingThe board of directors proposes to authorise the chairman of the general meeting - with right of substitution - to file the resolutions passed with the Danish Business Authority and to make such amendments to the resolutions passed by the general meeting which the Danish Business Authority might demand as a condition to register the resolutions passed by the general meeting.Additional informationAdoption requirementsThe proposal under agenda 11a and 11b requires that both 2/3 of the cast votes as well as 2/3 of the share capital represented at the general meeting are in favour of the proposal.The remaining proposals on the agenda can be adopted by simple majority.Share capital and voting rightsAt the time of this notice  the share capital in the Company is nominally DKK 1 149 890.51 divided into 114 989 051 shares  each of a nominal value of DKK 0.01 each.

It is anticipated that  in accordance with Listing Rule 5.2.8R  the Delisting will be effective at 8:00 a.m. on Friday  12 May 2023 (the ""Delisting Date""). Following the Delisting  the Company will no longer be subject to the regulatory and statutory regime which applies to companies admitted to the standard segment of the Official List and traded on the Main Market.The securities to which the Delisting relates are the Ordinary Shares of OKYO Pharma Limited with ISIN GG00BD3FV870. Following the Delisting  it will no longer be possible to trade the Ordinary Shares on the Main Market or any other market of the LSE.The Company will shortly put proposals to shareholders  inter alia  to consolidate every 65 existing Ordinary Shares into one new ordinary share of no par value (thereby matching its current ADS ratio). The Company then intends  on the Delisting Date  to collapse the ADS and directly list the Company’s new ordinary shares on Nasdaq in place of the current ADSs. This is an administrative ""substitution of security"" for the purposes of Nasdaq and current ADSs holders will automatically have their DTC accounts credited with the underlying new ordinary shares. ADS holders accordingly need to take no action.Story continuesInformation for holders through CRESTFollowing the share consolidation (which is expected to take place on the Delisting Date)  holders of the Company’s ordinary shares in CREST will receive a CDI (a CREST depositary interest issued by Euroclear) into their CREST account  with each CDI representing one new ordinary share. The CDIs can be exchanged for the new ordinary shares within the CREST system. Full information will be contained in the circular to be sent to shareholders and posted to the Company’s website.Information for holders in certificated formFor persons who currently hold Ordinary Shares in certificated form  these shareholders will receive a ""DRS Statement"" from the Company’s US transfer agent  by post. The DRS Statement will explain how to dematerialise the underlying shares into a trading account. ANY SHAREHOLDERS WHO CURRENTLY HOLD ORDINARY SHARES IN CERTIFICATED FORM ARE URGED TO SPEAK TO THEIR STOCKBROKER OR SHARE DEALING PLATFORM AND TO MOVE THEIR CERTIFICATED ORDINARY SHARES INTO CREST PRIOR TO THE DELISTING DATE. THIS WILL SUBSTANTIALLY SIMPLIFY THE PROCESS FOR RECEIVING NASDAQ TRADED ORDINARY SHARES. ANY HOLDER OF CERTIFICATED ORDINARY SHARES SHOULD ALSO ENSURE THAT THE COMPANY’S REGISTRAR HAS FULLY UP-TO-DATE INFORMATION AS TO THEIR CURRENT ADDRESS AS DRS STATEMENTS CANNOT EASILY BE REISSUED.Other informationThe Company will also file a registration statement with the SEC in respect of the ordinary shares not currently comprised in the ADSs to facilitate free trading in those shares.Following the Delisting  holders of ordinary shares will continue to be entitled to transfer such ordinary shares in accordance with the requirements of the Company's articles of association and the laws of the Bailiwick of Guernsey.Full information  including details of the action that shareholders holding in certificated form will need to take  will be contained in the circular to be sent to shareholders and posted to the Company’s website.For the purposes of UK MAR  the person who arranged the release of this information is Gary S.

Introduction of LTIP 2023The Board of Directors of the Company proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to adopt a long-term incentive programme in the form of a performance-based share savings program directed at the Group’s senior executives and other key employees employed in Sweden (“Participants”). LTIP 2023 is proposed to include a maximum of forty-five (45) Participants. Participants in LTIP 2023 must have contributed a private investment through the acquisition of shares in the Company (“Saving Shares”). Subsequently  after a three-year vesting period commencing on the date of entering into an agreement to participate in LTIP 2023 (the “Vesting Period”)  Participants will be given the opportunity to receive ordinary shares (“Performance Shares”) free of charge  subject to the main terms and conditions set forth below. Within the LTIP 2023  the Company will award Participants conditional share rights (“Share Rights”)  meaning the right  subject to certain conditions being met  to receive up to six (6) Performance Shares per Share Right free of charge.BackgroundThe Company’s Board of Directors is of the opinion that a performance-based share savings program contributes to higher motivation and commitment among employees and strengthens the bonds between the employees and the Company. Furthermore  it is the Board’s assessment that LTIP 2023 will contribute to the opportunities to recruit and retain knowledgeable and experienced employees who hold key positions in the Hexatronic Group and are expected to increase employee interest in the business and earnings development in the Company. LTIP 2023 has been designed on the basis that it is desirable that senior executives and other key employees within the Hexatronic Group are shareholders in the Company and LTIP 2023 rewards the continued loyalty of employees and thereby the long-term value growth in the Company. All in all  it is the Board’s assessment that LTIP 2023 will benefit both the employees and the Company’s shareholders through an increased share value.Private investmentIn order to participate in LTIP 2023  the Participant must have contributed with a private investment through the acquisition of Saving Shares. The shares shall have been acquired at market prices during the period between 15 May 2023 and 30 June 2023 for the purpose of being allocated to LTIP 2023  unless the Board of Directors allows exceptions in the individual case regarding shares acquired previously. The Board of Directors also has the right to thereafter  for individual additional Participants (new employees or promoted)  postpone the last day for the acquisition of Savings Shares (see more below under “Additional participants”).The maximum number of Saving Shares that a Participant can allocate to LTIP 2023 amounts to a rounded number of shares corresponding to a maximum of ten (10) per cent of the Participant’s annual gross basic salary calculated on the basis of the 2023 salary level and depending on the position in the Hexatronic Group. The minimum number of Saving Shares that a Participant must acquire to participate in LTIP 2023 shall correspond to a market value of at least five (5) per cent of the annual gross basic salary. For each Saving Share held within the LTIP 2023  the Company will grant Participants a Share Right  meaning the right  subject to certain conditions being met  to receive up to two  four or six Performance Shares per Share Right free of charge  depending on the position in the Hexatronic Group.Terms and conditionsIn addition to the requirement that the Participant’s employment and holding of Saving Shares shall continue throughout the Vesting Period  certain performance-based conditions linked to diluted earnings per share  Hexatronic Group growth and EBITA are imposed for the allotment of Performance Shares to the Participants.The Participants are divided into three categories and LTIP 2023 will involve the allocation of the maximum number of Performance Shares per Saving Share as follows:Category Maximum number of Performance Shares per Saving Share CEO and the management team (a total of approximately 10 persons) 6 Other senior executives (a total of approximately 25 persons) 4 Other key employees (a total of approximately 10 persons) 2Allotment free of charge of Performance Shares is  in addition to what is stated in the paragraph above  conditional on the achievement of the performance targets set by the Board of Directors. For maximum allotment of Performance Shares  it is required that the goals set by the Board of Directors are achieved or exceeded. The performance targets refer to (i) diluted earnings per share for the respective financial year 2023-2025 (the “Share Target”)  (ii) net sales growth for each financial year 2023-2025 (the “Growth Target”); and (iii) EBITA for the respective financial year 2023-2025 (the “EBITA Target”) (collectively  the “Performance Targets”)  whereby the respective Performance Targets shall be weighted by 1/3 each.If the minimum level is not reached  no Performance Shares related to the current Performance Target for the financial year will be vested and if the upper target level is reached  all Performance Shares arising from the current Performance Target for the financial year will be earned. In the event of an outcome between the minimum level and the upper target level  the earnings of the Performance Shares arising from the current Performance Target for the financial year will be made linearly. The final number of Performance Shares earned by each Participant shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number.The Share TargetThe Share Target relates to the development of the Company’s diluted earnings per share during the period from the date of the Annual General Meeting 2023 up to and including 31 December 2025. For each financial year  a minimum level and a maximum level of earnings per share have been set for the allotment of Performance Shares. In the event of an outcome between the minimum level and the upper target level  earnings of the Performance Shares arising from the current Performance Target for the financial year will be made linearly in the range of SEK 4.40–5.40 earnings per share (financial year 2023)  SEK 5.20–6.20 earnings per share (financial year 2024)  SEK 6.10–7.10 earnings per share (financial year 2025).The Growth TargetThe Growth Target for each financial year has been set by the Board of Directors as a percentage measure of increased sales per financial year during LTIP 2023 compared to the Company’s established net sales for the financial year 2022. For each financial year  a minimum level and an upper target level have been set corresponding to twenty (20) per cent and forty (40) per cent  respectively  for 2023  fifteen (15) per cent and twenty-five (25) per cent  respectively  for 2024 and fifteen (15) per cent and twenty-five (25) per cent  respectively  for 2025.The EBITA TargetThe EBITA Target for each financial year has been set by the Board of Directors as a percentage measure of increased EBITA per financial year during LTIP 2023 compared to the Company’s established EBITA for the financial year 2022. For each year  a weighted minimum level has been set for each financial year  which for the financial years 2023  2024 and 2025 corresponds to twelve (12.0) per cent and a weighted upper target level of eighteeen (18.0) per cent  respectively.Terms and conditions of the Share RightsIn addition to what is stated above  the following conditions shall apply to the Share Rights under LTIP 2023:(a) The Participant must acquire the Saving Shares prior to the beginning of the Vesting Period or  in the case of subsequent additional Participants  at the time determined by the Company’s Remuneration Committee.(b) The Share Rights are vested during the Vesting Period or  in the case of subsequent additional Participants  proportionately  rounded down  calculated linearly on a full-year basis depending on when the additional Participant joins LTIP 2023.(c) The Share Rights cannot be transferred or pledged.(d) Each Share Right entitles the Participant  under certain conditions  to receive up to six Performance Shares free of charge  depending on the position within the Hexatronic Group (see more on this above under “Terms and Conditions”)  after the end of the Vesting Period  provided that  subject to certain exceptions  the Participant has been employed in the Hexatronic Group during the Vesting Period and retains his or her original Saving Shares in the Company.Additional participantsIn the event that a Participant  following a resolution by the Company’s Remuneration Committee  is added after 30 June 2023  when calculating the maximum number of Saving Shares that the Participant may acquire  the Participant’s annual gross basic salary at the current time and a share price corresponding to the average of the average volume-weighted purchase price of the Company’s share on Nasdaq Stockholm during a period of ten trading days after the announcement of the quarterly report for the Company that is published immediately before the decision to allow the additional Participant to participate  rounded to the nearest SEK 0.10.For Saving Shares held by additional Participants within the LTIP 2023  the Company will award Share Rights proportionately  rounded down  calculated linearly on a full-year basis depending on when the additional Participant joins LTIP 2023. Additional Participants will be allotted Performance Shares no earlier than three (3) years after the Participant entered into an agreement to join LTIP 2023.Allotment of Performance SharesIn order to be able to complete LTIP 2023 in a cost-effective and flexible manner  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves  in accordance with item B below  that the Company’s commitments for delivery of and costs attributable to Performance Shares are primarily secured through a directed issue of a maximum of 261 071 shares of series C to Danske Bank A/S  Danske Bank filial Sverige (the “Bank”)  of which a maximum of 62 417 shares of series C may be issued to cover any social security contributions  with subsequent repurchases and conversion into ordinary shares and decisions on the transfer of own ordinary shares to senior executives and other key employees within the Hexatronic Group.The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves that a maximum of 198 654 ordinary shares may be transferred to Participants in accordance with LTIP 2023 and that a maximum of 62 417 ordinary shares may be transferred on the market to secure social security contributions in connection with LTIP 2023 (“Hedging Shares”).Costs for LTIP 2023Costs for LTIP 2023 are calculated in accordance with IFRS2 and are reported over the income statement.The cost is reported linearly over the Vesting Period.Based on the assumptions that LTIP 2023 will be fully subscribed by forty-five (45) Participants  that all of these invest the maximum amount allowed in Saving Shares in LTIP 2023  that the share price amounts to SEK one hundred and thirty-eight (138) at the time of investment  and that all Saving Shares remain at LTIP 2023’s end  this means a total cost for LTIP 2023 of approximately SEK 32 million  provided that the Performance Targets are fully achieved.The above amount also includes social security contributions  which are currently payable at a nominal rate of 31.42 per cent. With an assumed share price at LTIP 2023’s end of SEK two hundred seven (207) and otherwise with conditions as above  the social security contributions are estimated to amount to approximately SEK thirteen (13) million  provided that the Performance Targets are fully achieved.If the Performance Targets are achieved so that half of the Performance Shares are allocated to the Participants  the corresponding total cost is estimated to amount to SEK 15.2 million. LTIP 2023 has no limit on maximum profit for Participants and therefore no maximum cost of social security contributions can be calculated.Effects on key performance indicators and dilutionLTIP 2023 is expected to comprise a maximum of 198 654 Performance Shares and 62 417 Hedging Shares for social security contributions  excluding the Saving Shares  corresponding to approximately 0.13 per cent of the Company’s total number of outstanding shares after full exercise of ongoing and now resolved incentive programme.Outstanding rights to shares under previous long-term incentive programmes and the proposed long-term incentive programme amount to approximately 2.51 per cent of the Company’s total number of outstanding shares upon full exercise.Ongoing incentive programmes including LTIP 2023 are expected to have only marginal impact on significant key performance indicators.Additional ongoing share-based incentive programmesFor a description of the Company’s ongoing long-term incentive programmes  please refer to the Annual Report for 2022 which is available on the Company’s website  https://group.hexatronic.com/ .Preparation of the proposalLTIP 2023 has been prepared by the Board of Directors in consultation with the remuneration committee and external advisers.The Board of Directors or a special committee set up by the Board of Directors shall be responsible for the detailed design and management of the terms and conditions for LTIP 2023  in accordance with the above-mentioned terms and conditions including provisions on recalculation in the event of an in-between bonus issue  share split  rights issue and/or other similar events. In connection therewith  the Board of Directors shall have the right to make adjustments to meet specific market conditions. The Board of Directors shall also have the right to make other adjustments if there are significant changes in the Hexatronic Group or its operating environment that would result in the adopted terms and conditions for LTIP 2023 no longer fulfilling its purposes.B. Directed issue of convertible shares of series C  authorisation for the Board of Directors to resolve on the repurchase of all issued redeemable and convertible shares of series C  and transfer of own ordinary shares to Participants in accordance with LTIP 2023In order to be able to carry out LTIP 2023 in a cost-effective and flexible manner  the Board of Directors proposes that the Company’s commitments for delivery of and costs attributable to Performance Shares be secured primarily through a directed issue of convertible shares of series C  with subsequent repurchases and conversion into ordinary shares and resolution on the transfer of own ordinary shares to Participants.The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting instruct the Board of Directors to implement the decision above and to ensure that the Board of Directors transfers the Performance Shares in accordance with what is stated above. The Board further proposes that the Annual General Meeting instruct the Board  or whomever the Board appoints  to make such minor adjustments in the abovementioned proposed resolution that may prove necessary in connection with registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.Item 17 – Resolution to adopt a long-term incentive programme for the Group’s employees outside of Sweden (Warrant programme 2023)The Board of Directors’ of Hexatronic Group AB (publ) (the “Company”) proposal that the Annual General Meeting resolves on (A.) the adoption of a long-term incentive programme (Warrant Programme 2023) directed at the Group’s (the “Hexatronic Group”) employees outside of Sweden  and (B.) a directed issue of warrants (Series 2023/2026) to the wholly owned subsidiary Proximion AB (“Proximion”) and approval of the transfer of these warrants to participantsA. Introduction of Warrant Programme 2023The Board of Directors of the Company proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to adopt a long-term incentive programme directed at the Group’s senior executives and certain key employees employed outside of Sweden in accordance with the main terms and conditions set out below.BackgroundThe Company’s Board of Directors is of the opinion that the Warrant Programme 2023 will contribute to higher motivation and commitment among employees and strengthen the bonds between the employees and the Company.Furthermore  it is the Board’s assessment that the Warrant Programme 2023 will contribute to the opportunities to recruit and retain knowledgeable and experienced employees and is expected to increase employee interest in the business and earnings development in the Company. All in all  it is the Board’s assessment that the Warrant Programme 2023 will be beneficial for both the employees and for the Company’s shareholders through an increased share value.Warrant Programme 2023The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves on a directed share issue of a maximum of 441 000 warrants (hereinafter referred to as “Warrants”) and the subsequent transfer of a total of not more than 441 000 Warrants. The right to subscribe for Warrants shall only vest with Proximion  with the right and obligation for Proximion to manage the Warrants in accordance with the terms of the Warrant Programme 2023 and transfer the Warrants to participants free of charge. Each Warrant entitles the holder to subscribe for one ordinary share. The Warrants shall be issued free of charge to Proximion.Participants in the Warrant Programme 2023 shall  upon receipt of the offer  but no later than 31 May 2023  notify Proximion of the number of Warrants that the participant wishes to receive. In the event that the participants’ employment ends during the term of the Warrants  the Warrants shall be returned without consideration or other remuneration.Subscription of ordinary shares shall be possible during the period from and including 15 May 2026 up to and including 15 June 2026. The subscription price for ordinary shares subscribed for pursuant to the Warrants shall be set at 135 per cent of the volume-weighted average share price of the Hexatronic share during the measurement period from and including 9 May 2023 up to and including 20 May 2023. The subscription price shall be paid in cash or by set-off. The Company shall have the right  but not the obligation  at the request of participants who are unable to pay subscription proceeds in cash  to acquire at market price such number of Warrants as enable the participant to exercise the remaining Warrants to subscribe for ordinary shares  whereby the subscription proceeds are paid by offsetting against the receivable on divested Warrants.The exercise price  as set out above  shall be rounded to the nearest SEK 0.10  whereby SEK 0.05 shall be rounded downwards. The exercise price and the number of shares that each Warrant entitles to subscription for shall be recalculated in the event of a split  consolidation  new share issue etc. in accordance with market practice.Allocation of WarrantsThe Warrant Programme 2023 shall comprise approximately 40 senior executives  and approximately 70 key employees  employed in England  Belgium  Norway  Denmark  Finland  USA  Canada  Germany  Estonia  Latvia  Lithuania  Italy  Australia  South Korea  Netherlands  New Zealand and Austria and in total relate to a maximum of 441 000 Warrants. The maximum number of Warrants per participant in the Warrant Programme 2023 is shown in the table below.Category Maximum number of Warrants per person Maximum number of Warrants per category Senior executives approximately 9 000 approximately 235 000 Remaining key employees approximately 3 000 approximately 206 000In the event of changes in positions and employments  remaining Warrants in one category may be used in another category. The Board of Directors may decide that such Warrants that are not allotted in accordance with the above shall later be allocated to any new employees within the Hexatronic Group.Effects on key performance indicators and costsThe Warrants are issued free of charge to the participants and may incur social security contributions and costs in accordance with the accounting rules in IFRS2. The Board estimates that these costs will be limited.Since the Company’s costs for the Warrant Programme 2023 will be relatively limited  the Board of Directors has decided not to propose to the Annual General Meeting to decide on measures to cover these.Ongoing incentive programmes including Warrant Programme 2023 are expected to have only marginal impact on significant key performance indicators.DilutionBased on the existing number of ordinary shares in the Company  the Warrant Programme 2023  upon full exercise of all 441 000 Warrants  entails a dilution corresponding to approximately 0.22 per cent of the capital and votes related to ordinary shares. If all outstanding incentive programmes in the Company are included in the calculation  the corresponding maximum dilution  at the time of the Annual General Meeting  amounts to approximately 2.6 per cent of the capital and the number of votes related to ordinary shares.Additional ongoing share-based incentive programmesFor a description of the Company’s ongoing long-term incentive programmes  please refer to the Annual Report for 2022 which is available on the Company’s website  https://group.hexatronic.com.Preparation of the proposalThe Warrant Programme 2023 has been prepared by the Board of Directors in consultation with company management and external advisors.The Board of Directors or a special committee set up by the Board of Directors shall be responsible for the detailed design and management of the terms and conditions for the Warrant Programme 2023  in accordance with the above-mentioned terms and conditions including provisions on recalculation in the event of an in-between bonus issue  share split  rights issue and/or other similar events. In connection therewith  the Board of Directors shall have the right to make adjustments to meet specific market conditions. The Board of Directors shall also have the right to make other adjustments if there are significant changes in the Hexatronic Group or its operating environment that would result in the decided terms of the Warrant Programme 2023 no longer fulfilling its purposes.B. Directed issue of warrants  Series 2023/2026  to the wholly owned subsidiary Proximion AB  and approval of their transfer to participants under the Warrant Programme 2023The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to issue not more than 441 000 Warrants  as a result of which the Company’s share capital may increase by a maximum of SEK 4 410. The following conditions shall apply.The right to subscribe for Warrants shall  with deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights  vest with Proximion AB  which shall then transfer the Warrants to the appropriate participants in the Warrant Programme 2023. Each Warrant entitles the holder to subscribe for one share. The Warrants shall be issued free of charge to Proximion. Each warrant entitles the holder to subscribe for one new ordinary share in Hexatronic Group AB (publ) during the period from and including 15 May 2026 up to and including 15 June 2026 at a subscription price of 135 per cent of the volume-weighted average share price of the Hexatronic share during the measurement period from and including 9 May 2023 up to and including 20 May 2023. The Board of Directors has the right to extend the subscription period  but no more than six months. The exercise price and the number of shares that each Warrant entitles to subscription of shall be recalculated in the event of a split  reverse share split  new issue of shares  etc. in accordance with market practice. The amount that  in the case of share subscription  exceeds the quota value shall be transferred to the free premium fund. Subscription of Warrants must be made on the subscription list no later than 31 May 2023. However  the Board of Directors shall have the right to extend the subscription period. The Warrants are issued free of charge to Proximion. New shares pursuant to subscription entitle to dividends for the first time on the record date for dividends that occurs immediately after subscription has been effected. The warrants shall in all other respects be governed by the terms and conditions set forth in Appendix A.The Board of Directors also proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to approve that Proximion AB  in accordance with the incentive programme  may transfer Warrants to participants in the Warrant Programme 2023 and manage Warrants in accordance with the Warrant Programme 2023. Proximion AB shall have the right to retain such Warrants that are not allotted in accordance with the above for later allotment to additional employees within the Hexatronic Group as decided by the Company’s Board of Directors.It is further proposed that the Board of Directors  or whomever they appoint  should be authorised to undertake such minor adjustments in the decision that may be required for the registration with the Companies Registration Office.Oversubscription cannot take place.The rationale for the deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights is to implement incentive programmes for employees outside of Sweden in the Hexatronic Group.The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting instruct the Board of Directors to implement the decisions above and to ensure that the Board of Directors in Proximion transfers the Warrants in accordance with what is stated above.The Board further proposes that the Annual General Meeting instruct the Board  or whomever the Board appoints  to make such minor adjustments in the abovementioned proposed resolutions that may prove necessary in connection with registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.Item 18 – Resolution to authorise the Board of Directors to resolve on the acquire and transfer of own sharesThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to authorise the Board of Directors  for the period until the end of the next Annual General Meeting  on one or several occasions  to resolve to acquire the Company’s own shares. The Board of Directors further proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to authorise the Board of Directors  for the period until the end of the next Annual General Meeting  on one or several occasions  to resolve to transfer the own shares held by the Company at the time of the Board of Directors’ decision on transfer. The following conditions shall apply.Shares may be acquired to the extent that the Company’s holding of its own shares  on any occasion  does not exceed ten (10) per cent of the Company’s total outstanding shares.The shares may be acquired through an offer directed at all shareholders or through trading on Nasdaq Stockholm. When trading on Nasdaq Stockholm the price shall correspond to the price interval registered at any given time  by which is meant the interval between the highest purchase price and the lowest sale price. Acquisition offers directed at all shareholders may only be made for consideration in cash and shall be made at a price corresponding to the registered price interval at any given time with a maximum deviation of 30 per cent upwards.The purpose of the proposed authorisation is to give the Board the opportunity to adapt the Company’s capital structure to its capital needs and thereby  among other things  be able to use the repurchased shares as a means of payment for the acquisition of companies.Transfer of own shares may be made through trading on Nasdaq Stockholm at a price within the price interval registered at any given time  which means the interval between the highest purchase price and the lowest sale price. Transfer of shares acquired in accordance with the above may also take place outside Nasdaq Stockholm  with or without deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights and with or without provisions on non-cash consideration or right of set-off. Transfer of own shares may  for example  be used as a means of payment in connection with company acquisitions on terms in accordance with the Swedish Companies Act’s rules on new issues. Such transfer may be made at a price in cash  or value  of property obtained  which  in the case of a business combination  corresponds to the stock exchange price at the time of the transfer.If the exercise of the authorisation regarding the acquisition and transfer of own shares is combined with the exercise of the authorisation regarding the new issue of shares  warrants and/or convertibles  item 19 on the agenda  for the purpose of financing all or part of the purchase price in the event of one and the same business acquisition or one and the same investment in connection with the conclusion of a new contract or the start-up of a new business area  the number of shares transferred and financial instruments issued during the period until the end of the next Annual General Meeting  together may not exceed one tenth of all outstanding shares in the Company at the time of the resolution authorizing a new issue.The possibility of deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights when transferring own shares is justified by the fact that transfer of shares over Nasdaq Stockholm or otherwise with deviation from preferential rights for shareholders can take place with greater speed  flexibility and is more cost-effective than transfer to all shareholders. If the Company’s own shares are transferred for consideration in a form other than cash in connection with agreements on the acquisition of assets  the Company cannot give shareholders the opportunity to exercise any preferential rights.The Board of Directors  or any person appointed by the Board of Directors  shall have the right to make any adjustments or amendments of the above resolution which may be required in connection with the registration of such resolution and to take any other measure deemed necessary for the execution of the resolution.Item 19 – Resolution to authorise the Board of Directors to resolve on new issues of shares  warrants and/or convertiblesThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to authorise the Board of Directors  for the period until the end of the next Annual General Meeting  on one or several occasions and with or without deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights  to resolve on new share issues  warrants and/or convertibles corresponding to not more than ten (10) per cent of the registered share capital in the Company at the time of the issue resolution.The authorisation may be utilised for new issues  which may be made with provisions regarding contribution in cash  in kind or through set-off. A new issue may only be made at market price. In order to enable delivery of shares in connection with a cash issue as described above  this may  if the Board of Directors deems it appropriate  be made at a subscription price corresponding to the quota value of the shares  whereby the issue is directed to an issuing agency acting as a settlement bank for investors.Deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights shall only be possible in connection with company acquisitions. If the Board of Directors resolves on an issue with deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights  the rationale shall be that the Company quickly needs access to capital in the event of a company acquisition or alternatively need to pay with the Company’s shares  warrants and/or convertibles.If the exercise of the authorisation regarding a new share issue is combined with the exercise of the authorisation regarding the acquisition and transfer of own shares  item 18 on the agenda  in order to finance all or part of the purchase price in one and the same company acquisition  the number of shares transferred and issued during the period until the end of the next Annual General Meeting  together may not exceed one tenth of all shares in the Company at the time of the resolution to authorise a new share issue.MISCELLANEOUSSpecial majority requirementFor valid resolutions in accordance with item 16 and 17 above  it is required that the proposals be supported by at least nine tenths (9/10) of the shares represented and votes cast at the Annual General Meeting.For valid resolutions in accordance with item 18 and 19 above  it is required that the proposals be supported by at least two thirds (2/3) of the shares represented and votes cast at the Annual General Meeting.Number of shares and votesAs per the date of this notice  the total number of outstanding shares and votes in the Company is 205 062 579 of which 203 026 610 are ordinary shares and 2 035 969 are shares of series C.

These purchases may occur either in the open market at prevailing prices or in private transactions at negotiated prices. To the extent information about such purchases or arrangements to purchase is made public in Finland  such information will be disclosed by means of a press release or other means reasonably calculated to inform U.S. shareholders of Caverion of such information.

It is anticipated that  in accordance with Listing Rule 5.2.8R  the Delisting will be effective at 8:00 a.m. on Friday  12 May 2023 (the ""Delisting Date""). Following the Delisting  the Company will no longer be subject to the regulatory and statutory regime which applies to companies admitted to the standard segment of the Official List and traded on the Main Market.The securities to which the Delisting relates are the Ordinary Shares of OKYO Pharma Limited with ISIN GG00BD3FV870. Following the Delisting  it will no longer be possible to trade the Ordinary Shares on the Main Market or any other market of the LSE.The Company will shortly put proposals to shareholders  inter alia  to consolidate every 65 existing Ordinary Shares into one new ordinary share of no par value (thereby matching its current ADS ratio). The Company then intends  on the Delisting Date  to collapse the ADS and directly list the Company’s new ordinary shares on Nasdaq in place of the current ADSs. This is an administrative ""substitution of security"" for the purposes of Nasdaq and current ADSs holders will automatically have their DTC accounts credited with the underlying new ordinary shares. ADS holders accordingly need to take no action.Information for holders through CRESTFollowing the share consolidation (which is expected to take place on the Delisting Date)  holders of the Company’s ordinary shares in CREST will receive a CDI (a CREST depositary interest issued by Euroclear) into their CREST account  with each CDI representing one new ordinary share. The CDIs can be exchanged for the new ordinary shares within the CREST system. Full information will be contained in the circular to be sent to shareholders and posted to the Company’s website.Information for holders in certificated formFor persons who currently hold Ordinary Shares in certificated form  these shareholders will receive a ""DRS Statement"" from the Company’s US transfer agent  by post. The DRS Statement will explain how to dematerialise the underlying shares into a trading account. ANY SHAREHOLDERS WHO CURRENTLY HOLD ORDINARY SHARES IN CERTIFICATED FORM ARE URGED TO SPEAK TO THEIR STOCKBROKER OR SHARE DEALING PLATFORM AND TO MOVE THEIR CERTIFICATED ORDINARY SHARES INTO CREST PRIOR TO THE DELISTING DATE. THIS WILL SUBSTANTIALLY SIMPLIFY THE PROCESS FOR RECEIVING NASDAQ TRADED ORDINARY SHARES. ANY HOLDER OF CERTIFICATED ORDINARY SHARES SHOULD ALSO ENSURE THAT THE COMPANY’S REGISTRAR HAS FULLY UP-TO-DATE INFORMATION AS TO THEIR CURRENT ADDRESS AS DRS STATEMENTS CANNOT EASILY BE REISSUED.Other informationThe Company will also file a registration statement with the SEC in respect of the ordinary shares not currently comprised in the ADSs to facilitate free trading in those shares.Following the Delisting  holders of ordinary shares will continue to be entitled to transfer such ordinary shares in accordance with the requirements of the Company's articles of association and the laws of the Bailiwick of Guernsey.Full information  including details of the action that shareholders holding in certificated form will need to take  will be contained in the circular to be sent to shareholders and posted to the Company’s website.For the purposes of UK MAR  the person who arranged the release of this information is Gary S.

Introduction of LTIP 2023The Board of Directors of the Company proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to adopt a long-term incentive programme in the form of a performance-based share savings program directed at the Group’s senior executives and other key employees employed in Sweden (“Participants”). LTIP 2023 is proposed to include a maximum of forty-five (45) Participants. Participants in LTIP 2023 must have contributed a private investment through the acquisition of shares in the Company (“Saving Shares”). Subsequently  after a three-year vesting period commencing on the date of entering into an agreement to participate in LTIP 2023 (the “Vesting Period”)  Participants will be given the opportunity to receive ordinary shares (“Performance Shares”) free of charge  subject to the main terms and conditions set forth below. Within the LTIP 2023  the Company will award Participants conditional share rights (“Share Rights”)  meaning the right  subject to certain conditions being met  to receive up to six (6) Performance Shares per Share Right free of charge.BackgroundThe Company’s Board of Directors is of the opinion that a performance-based share savings program contributes to higher motivation and commitment among employees and strengthens the bonds between the employees and the Company. Furthermore  it is the Board’s assessment that LTIP 2023 will contribute to the opportunities to recruit and retain knowledgeable and experienced employees who hold key positions in the Hexatronic Group and are expected to increase employee interest in the business and earnings development in the Company. LTIP 2023 has been designed on the basis that it is desirable that senior executives and other key employees within the Hexatronic Group are shareholders in the Company and LTIP 2023 rewards the continued loyalty of employees and thereby the long-term value growth in the Company. All in all  it is the Board’s assessment that LTIP 2023 will benefit both the employees and the Company’s shareholders through an increased share value.Private investmentIn order to participate in LTIP 2023  the Participant must have contributed with a private investment through the acquisition of Saving Shares. The shares shall have been acquired at market prices during the period between 15 May 2023 and 30 June 2023 for the purpose of being allocated to LTIP 2023  unless the Board of Directors allows exceptions in the individual case regarding shares acquired previously. The Board of Directors also has the right to thereafter  for individual additional Participants (new employees or promoted)  postpone the last day for the acquisition of Savings Shares (see more below under “Additional participants”).The maximum number of Saving Shares that a Participant can allocate to LTIP 2023 amounts to a rounded number of shares corresponding to a maximum of ten (10) per cent of the Participant’s annual gross basic salary calculated on the basis of the 2023 salary level and depending on the position in the Hexatronic Group. The minimum number of Saving Shares that a Participant must acquire to participate in LTIP 2023 shall correspond to a market value of at least five (5) per cent of the annual gross basic salary. For each Saving Share held within the LTIP 2023  the Company will grant Participants a Share Right  meaning the right  subject to certain conditions being met  to receive up to two  four or six Performance Shares per Share Right free of charge  depending on the position in the Hexatronic Group.Terms and conditionsIn addition to the requirement that the Participant’s employment and holding of Saving Shares shall continue throughout the Vesting Period  certain performance-based conditions linked to diluted earnings per share  Hexatronic Group growth and EBITA are imposed for the allotment of Performance Shares to the Participants.The Participants are divided into three categories and LTIP 2023 will involve the allocation of the maximum number of Performance Shares per Saving Share as follows:Category Maximum number of Performance Shares per Saving Share CEO and the management team (a total of approximately 10 persons) 6 Other senior executives (a total of approximately 25 persons) 4 Other key employees (a total of approximately 10 persons) 2Allotment free of charge of Performance Shares is  in addition to what is stated in the paragraph above  conditional on the achievement of the performance targets set by the Board of Directors. For maximum allotment of Performance Shares  it is required that the goals set by the Board of Directors are achieved or exceeded. The performance targets refer to (i) diluted earnings per share for the respective financial year 2023-2025 (the “Share Target”)  (ii) net sales growth for each financial year 2023-2025 (the “Growth Target”); and (iii) EBITA for the respective financial year 2023-2025 (the “EBITA Target”) (collectively  the “Performance Targets”)  whereby the respective Performance Targets shall be weighted by 1/3 each.If the minimum level is not reached  no Performance Shares related to the current Performance Target for the financial year will be vested and if the upper target level is reached  all Performance Shares arising from the current Performance Target for the financial year will be earned. In the event of an outcome between the minimum level and the upper target level  the earnings of the Performance Shares arising from the current Performance Target for the financial year will be made linearly. The final number of Performance Shares earned by each Participant shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number.The Share TargetThe Share Target relates to the development of the Company’s diluted earnings per share during the period from the date of the Annual General Meeting 2023 up to and including 31 December 2025. For each financial year  a minimum level and a maximum level of earnings per share have been set for the allotment of Performance Shares. In the event of an outcome between the minimum level and the upper target level  earnings of the Performance Shares arising from the current Performance Target for the financial year will be made linearly in the range of SEK 4.40–5.40 earnings per share (financial year 2023)  SEK 5.20–6.20 earnings per share (financial year 2024)  SEK 6.10–7.10 earnings per share (financial year 2025).The Growth TargetThe Growth Target for each financial year has been set by the Board of Directors as a percentage measure of increased sales per financial year during LTIP 2023 compared to the Company’s established net sales for the financial year 2022. For each financial year  a minimum level and an upper target level have been set corresponding to twenty (20) per cent and forty (40) per cent  respectively  for 2023  fifteen (15) per cent and twenty-five (25) per cent  respectively  for 2024 and fifteen (15) per cent and twenty-five (25) per cent  respectively  for 2025.The EBITA TargetThe EBITA Target for each financial year has been set by the Board of Directors as a percentage measure of increased EBITA per financial year during LTIP 2023 compared to the Company’s established EBITA for the financial year 2022. For each year  a weighted minimum level has been set for each financial year  which for the financial years 2023  2024 and 2025 corresponds to twelve (12.0) per cent and a weighted upper target level of eighteeen (18.0) per cent  respectively.Terms and conditions of the Share RightsIn addition to what is stated above  the following conditions shall apply to the Share Rights under LTIP 2023:(a) The Participant must acquire the Saving Shares prior to the beginning of the Vesting Period or  in the case of subsequent additional Participants  at the time determined by the Company’s Remuneration Committee.(b) The Share Rights are vested during the Vesting Period or  in the case of subsequent additional Participants  proportionately  rounded down  calculated linearly on a full-year basis depending on when the additional Participant joins LTIP 2023.(c) The Share Rights cannot be transferred or pledged.(d) Each Share Right entitles the Participant  under certain conditions  to receive up to six Performance Shares free of charge  depending on the position within the Hexatronic Group (see more on this above under “Terms and Conditions”)  after the end of the Vesting Period  provided that  subject to certain exceptions  the Participant has been employed in the Hexatronic Group during the Vesting Period and retains his or her original Saving Shares in the Company.Additional participantsIn the event that a Participant  following a resolution by the Company’s Remuneration Committee  is added after 30 June 2023  when calculating the maximum number of Saving Shares that the Participant may acquire  the Participant’s annual gross basic salary at the current time and a share price corresponding to the average of the average volume-weighted purchase price of the Company’s share on Nasdaq Stockholm during a period of ten trading days after the announcement of the quarterly report for the Company that is published immediately before the decision to allow the additional Participant to participate  rounded to the nearest SEK 0.10.For Saving Shares held by additional Participants within the LTIP 2023  the Company will award Share Rights proportionately  rounded down  calculated linearly on a full-year basis depending on when the additional Participant joins LTIP 2023. Additional Participants will be allotted Performance Shares no earlier than three (3) years after the Participant entered into an agreement to join LTIP 2023.Allotment of Performance SharesIn order to be able to complete LTIP 2023 in a cost-effective and flexible manner  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves  in accordance with item B below  that the Company’s commitments for delivery of and costs attributable to Performance Shares are primarily secured through a directed issue of a maximum of 261 071 shares of series C to Danske Bank A/S  Danske Bank filial Sverige (the “Bank”)  of which a maximum of 62 417 shares of series C may be issued to cover any social security contributions  with subsequent repurchases and conversion into ordinary shares and decisions on the transfer of own ordinary shares to senior executives and other key employees within the Hexatronic Group.The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves that a maximum of 198 654 ordinary shares may be transferred to Participants in accordance with LTIP 2023 and that a maximum of 62 417 ordinary shares may be transferred on the market to secure social security contributions in connection with LTIP 2023 (“Hedging Shares”).Costs for LTIP 2023Costs for LTIP 2023 are calculated in accordance with IFRS2 and are reported over the income statement.The cost is reported linearly over the Vesting Period.Based on the assumptions that LTIP 2023 will be fully subscribed by forty-five (45) Participants  that all of these invest the maximum amount allowed in Saving Shares in LTIP 2023  that the share price amounts to SEK one hundred and thirty-eight (138) at the time of investment  and that all Saving Shares remain at LTIP 2023’s end  this means a total cost for LTIP 2023 of approximately SEK 32 million  provided that the Performance Targets are fully achieved.The above amount also includes social security contributions  which are currently payable at a nominal rate of 31.42 per cent. With an assumed share price at LTIP 2023’s end of SEK two hundred seven (207) and otherwise with conditions as above  the social security contributions are estimated to amount to approximately SEK thirteen (13) million  provided that the Performance Targets are fully achieved.If the Performance Targets are achieved so that half of the Performance Shares are allocated to the Participants  the corresponding total cost is estimated to amount to SEK 15.2 million. LTIP 2023 has no limit on maximum profit for Participants and therefore no maximum cost of social security contributions can be calculated.Effects on key performance indicators and dilutionLTIP 2023 is expected to comprise a maximum of 198 654 Performance Shares and 62 417 Hedging Shares for social security contributions  excluding the Saving Shares  corresponding to approximately 0.13 per cent of the Company’s total number of outstanding shares after full exercise of ongoing and now resolved incentive programme.Outstanding rights to shares under previous long-term incentive programmes and the proposed long-term incentive programme amount to approximately 2.51 per cent of the Company’s total number of outstanding shares upon full exercise.Ongoing incentive programmes including LTIP 2023 are expected to have only marginal impact on significant key performance indicators.Additional ongoing share-based incentive programmesFor a description of the Company’s ongoing long-term incentive programmes  please refer to the Annual Report for 2022 which is available on the Company’s website  https://group.hexatronic.com/ .Preparation of the proposalLTIP 2023 has been prepared by the Board of Directors in consultation with the remuneration committee and external advisers.The Board of Directors or a special committee set up by the Board of Directors shall be responsible for the detailed design and management of the terms and conditions for LTIP 2023  in accordance with the above-mentioned terms and conditions including provisions on recalculation in the event of an in-between bonus issue  share split  rights issue and/or other similar events. In connection therewith  the Board of Directors shall have the right to make adjustments to meet specific market conditions. The Board of Directors shall also have the right to make other adjustments if there are significant changes in the Hexatronic Group or its operating environment that would result in the adopted terms and conditions for LTIP 2023 no longer fulfilling its purposes.B. Directed issue of convertible shares of series C  authorisation for the Board of Directors to resolve on the repurchase of all issued redeemable and convertible shares of series C  and transfer of own ordinary shares to Participants in accordance with LTIP 2023In order to be able to carry out LTIP 2023 in a cost-effective and flexible manner  the Board of Directors proposes that the Company’s commitments for delivery of and costs attributable to Performance Shares be secured primarily through a directed issue of convertible shares of series C  with subsequent repurchases and conversion into ordinary shares and resolution on the transfer of own ordinary shares to Participants.The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting instruct the Board of Directors to implement the decision above and to ensure that the Board of Directors transfers the Performance Shares in accordance with what is stated above. The Board further proposes that the Annual General Meeting instruct the Board  or whomever the Board appoints  to make such minor adjustments in the abovementioned proposed resolution that may prove necessary in connection with registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.Item 17 – Resolution to adopt a long-term incentive programme for the Group’s employees outside of Sweden (Warrant programme 2023)The Board of Directors’ of Hexatronic Group AB (publ) (the “Company”) proposal that the Annual General Meeting resolves on (A.) the adoption of a long-term incentive programme (Warrant Programme 2023) directed at the Group’s (the “Hexatronic Group”) employees outside of Sweden  and (B.) a directed issue of warrants (Series 2023/2026) to the wholly owned subsidiary Proximion AB (“Proximion”) and approval of the transfer of these warrants to participantsA. Introduction of Warrant Programme 2023The Board of Directors of the Company proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to adopt a long-term incentive programme directed at the Group’s senior executives and certain key employees employed outside of Sweden in accordance with the main terms and conditions set out below.BackgroundThe Company’s Board of Directors is of the opinion that the Warrant Programme 2023 will contribute to higher motivation and commitment among employees and strengthen the bonds between the employees and the Company.Furthermore  it is the Board’s assessment that the Warrant Programme 2023 will contribute to the opportunities to recruit and retain knowledgeable and experienced employees and is expected to increase employee interest in the business and earnings development in the Company. All in all  it is the Board’s assessment that the Warrant Programme 2023 will be beneficial for both the employees and for the Company’s shareholders through an increased share value.Warrant Programme 2023The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves on a directed share issue of a maximum of 441 000 warrants (hereinafter referred to as “Warrants”) and the subsequent transfer of a total of not more than 441 000 Warrants. The right to subscribe for Warrants shall only vest with Proximion  with the right and obligation for Proximion to manage the Warrants in accordance with the terms of the Warrant Programme 2023 and transfer the Warrants to participants free of charge. Each Warrant entitles the holder to subscribe for one ordinary share. The Warrants shall be issued free of charge to Proximion.Participants in the Warrant Programme 2023 shall  upon receipt of the offer  but no later than 31 May 2023  notify Proximion of the number of Warrants that the participant wishes to receive. In the event that the participants’ employment ends during the term of the Warrants  the Warrants shall be returned without consideration or other remuneration.Subscription of ordinary shares shall be possible during the period from and including 15 May 2026 up to and including 15 June 2026. The subscription price for ordinary shares subscribed for pursuant to the Warrants shall be set at 135 per cent of the volume-weighted average share price of the Hexatronic share during the measurement period from and including 9 May 2023 up to and including 20 May 2023. The subscription price shall be paid in cash or by set-off. The Company shall have the right  but not the obligation  at the request of participants who are unable to pay subscription proceeds in cash  to acquire at market price such number of Warrants as enable the participant to exercise the remaining Warrants to subscribe for ordinary shares  whereby the subscription proceeds are paid by offsetting against the receivable on divested Warrants.The exercise price  as set out above  shall be rounded to the nearest SEK 0.10  whereby SEK 0.05 shall be rounded downwards. The exercise price and the number of shares that each Warrant entitles to subscription for shall be recalculated in the event of a split  consolidation  new share issue etc. in accordance with market practice.Allocation of WarrantsThe Warrant Programme 2023 shall comprise approximately 40 senior executives  and approximately 70 key employees  employed in England  Belgium  Norway  Denmark  Finland  USA  Canada  Germany  Estonia  Latvia  Lithuania  Italy  Australia  South Korea  Netherlands  New Zealand and Austria and in total relate to a maximum of 441 000 Warrants. The maximum number of Warrants per participant in the Warrant Programme 2023 is shown in the table below.Category Maximum number of Warrants per person Maximum number of Warrants per category Senior executives approximately 9 000 approximately 235 000 Remaining key employees approximately 3 000 approximately 206 000In the event of changes in positions and employments  remaining Warrants in one category may be used in another category. The Board of Directors may decide that such Warrants that are not allotted in accordance with the above shall later be allocated to any new employees within the Hexatronic Group.Effects on key performance indicators and costsThe Warrants are issued free of charge to the participants and may incur social security contributions and costs in accordance with the accounting rules in IFRS2. The Board estimates that these costs will be limited.Since the Company’s costs for the Warrant Programme 2023 will be relatively limited  the Board of Directors has decided not to propose to the Annual General Meeting to decide on measures to cover these.Ongoing incentive programmes including Warrant Programme 2023 are expected to have only marginal impact on significant key performance indicators.DilutionBased on the existing number of ordinary shares in the Company  the Warrant Programme 2023  upon full exercise of all 441 000 Warrants  entails a dilution corresponding to approximately 0.22 per cent of the capital and votes related to ordinary shares. If all outstanding incentive programmes in the Company are included in the calculation  the corresponding maximum dilution  at the time of the Annual General Meeting  amounts to approximately 2.6 per cent of the capital and the number of votes related to ordinary shares.Additional ongoing share-based incentive programmesFor a description of the Company’s ongoing long-term incentive programmes  please refer to the Annual Report for 2022 which is available on the Company’s website  https://group.hexatronic.com.Preparation of the proposalThe Warrant Programme 2023 has been prepared by the Board of Directors in consultation with company management and external advisors.The Board of Directors or a special committee set up by the Board of Directors shall be responsible for the detailed design and management of the terms and conditions for the Warrant Programme 2023  in accordance with the above-mentioned terms and conditions including provisions on recalculation in the event of an in-between bonus issue  share split  rights issue and/or other similar events. In connection therewith  the Board of Directors shall have the right to make adjustments to meet specific market conditions. The Board of Directors shall also have the right to make other adjustments if there are significant changes in the Hexatronic Group or its operating environment that would result in the decided terms of the Warrant Programme 2023 no longer fulfilling its purposes.B. Directed issue of warrants  Series 2023/2026  to the wholly owned subsidiary Proximion AB  and approval of their transfer to participants under the Warrant Programme 2023The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to issue not more than 441 000 Warrants  as a result of which the Company’s share capital may increase by a maximum of SEK 4 410. The following conditions shall apply.The right to subscribe for Warrants shall  with deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights  vest with Proximion AB  which shall then transfer the Warrants to the appropriate participants in the Warrant Programme 2023. Each Warrant entitles the holder to subscribe for one share. The Warrants shall be issued free of charge to Proximion. Each warrant entitles the holder to subscribe for one new ordinary share in Hexatronic Group AB (publ) during the period from and including 15 May 2026 up to and including 15 June 2026 at a subscription price of 135 per cent of the volume-weighted average share price of the Hexatronic share during the measurement period from and including 9 May 2023 up to and including 20 May 2023. The Board of Directors has the right to extend the subscription period  but no more than six months. The exercise price and the number of shares that each Warrant entitles to subscription of shall be recalculated in the event of a split  reverse share split  new issue of shares  etc. in accordance with market practice. The amount that  in the case of share subscription  exceeds the quota value shall be transferred to the free premium fund. Subscription of Warrants must be made on the subscription list no later than 31 May 2023. However  the Board of Directors shall have the right to extend the subscription period. The Warrants are issued free of charge to Proximion. New shares pursuant to subscription entitle to dividends for the first time on the record date for dividends that occurs immediately after subscription has been effected. The warrants shall in all other respects be governed by the terms and conditions set forth in Appendix A.The Board of Directors also proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to approve that Proximion AB  in accordance with the incentive programme  may transfer Warrants to participants in the Warrant Programme 2023 and manage Warrants in accordance with the Warrant Programme 2023. Proximion AB shall have the right to retain such Warrants that are not allotted in accordance with the above for later allotment to additional employees within the Hexatronic Group as decided by the Company’s Board of Directors.It is further proposed that the Board of Directors  or whomever they appoint  should be authorised to undertake such minor adjustments in the decision that may be required for the registration with the Companies Registration Office.Oversubscription cannot take place.The rationale for the deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights is to implement incentive programmes for employees outside of Sweden in the Hexatronic Group.The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting instruct the Board of Directors to implement the decisions above and to ensure that the Board of Directors in Proximion transfers the Warrants in accordance with what is stated above.The Board further proposes that the Annual General Meeting instruct the Board  or whomever the Board appoints  to make such minor adjustments in the abovementioned proposed resolutions that may prove necessary in connection with registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.Item 18 – Resolution to authorise the Board of Directors to resolve on the acquire and transfer of own sharesThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to authorise the Board of Directors  for the period until the end of the next Annual General Meeting  on one or several occasions  to resolve to acquire the Company’s own shares. The Board of Directors further proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to authorise the Board of Directors  for the period until the end of the next Annual General Meeting  on one or several occasions  to resolve to transfer the own shares held by the Company at the time of the Board of Directors’ decision on transfer. The following conditions shall apply.Shares may be acquired to the extent that the Company’s holding of its own shares  on any occasion  does not exceed ten (10) per cent of the Company’s total outstanding shares.The shares may be acquired through an offer directed at all shareholders or through trading on Nasdaq Stockholm. When trading on Nasdaq Stockholm the price shall correspond to the price interval registered at any given time  by which is meant the interval between the highest purchase price and the lowest sale price. Acquisition offers directed at all shareholders may only be made for consideration in cash and shall be made at a price corresponding to the registered price interval at any given time with a maximum deviation of 30 per cent upwards.The purpose of the proposed authorisation is to give the Board the opportunity to adapt the Company’s capital structure to its capital needs and thereby  among other things  be able to use the repurchased shares as a means of payment for the acquisition of companies.Transfer of own shares may be made through trading on Nasdaq Stockholm at a price within the price interval registered at any given time  which means the interval between the highest purchase price and the lowest sale price. Transfer of shares acquired in accordance with the above may also take place outside Nasdaq Stockholm  with or without deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights and with or without provisions on non-cash consideration or right of set-off. Transfer of own shares may  for example  be used as a means of payment in connection with company acquisitions on terms in accordance with the Swedish Companies Act’s rules on new issues. Such transfer may be made at a price in cash  or value  of property obtained  which  in the case of a business combination  corresponds to the stock exchange price at the time of the transfer.If the exercise of the authorisation regarding the acquisition and transfer of own shares is combined with the exercise of the authorisation regarding the new issue of shares  warrants and/or convertibles  item 19 on the agenda  for the purpose of financing all or part of the purchase price in the event of one and the same business acquisition or one and the same investment in connection with the conclusion of a new contract or the start-up of a new business area  the number of shares transferred and financial instruments issued during the period until the end of the next Annual General Meeting  together may not exceed one tenth of all outstanding shares in the Company at the time of the resolution authorizing a new issue.The possibility of deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights when transferring own shares is justified by the fact that transfer of shares over Nasdaq Stockholm or otherwise with deviation from preferential rights for shareholders can take place with greater speed  flexibility and is more cost-effective than transfer to all shareholders. If the Company’s own shares are transferred for consideration in a form other than cash in connection with agreements on the acquisition of assets  the Company cannot give shareholders the opportunity to exercise any preferential rights.The Board of Directors  or any person appointed by the Board of Directors  shall have the right to make any adjustments or amendments of the above resolution which may be required in connection with the registration of such resolution and to take any other measure deemed necessary for the execution of the resolution.Item 19 – Resolution to authorise the Board of Directors to resolve on new issues of shares  warrants and/or convertiblesThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to authorise the Board of Directors  for the period until the end of the next Annual General Meeting  on one or several occasions and with or without deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights  to resolve on new share issues  warrants and/or convertibles corresponding to not more than ten (10) per cent of the registered share capital in the Company at the time of the issue resolution.The authorisation may be utilised for new issues  which may be made with provisions regarding contribution in cash  in kind or through set-off. A new issue may only be made at market price. In order to enable delivery of shares in connection with a cash issue as described above  this may  if the Board of Directors deems it appropriate  be made at a subscription price corresponding to the quota value of the shares  whereby the issue is directed to an issuing agency acting as a settlement bank for investors.Deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights shall only be possible in connection with company acquisitions. If the Board of Directors resolves on an issue with deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights  the rationale shall be that the Company quickly needs access to capital in the event of a company acquisition or alternatively need to pay with the Company’s shares  warrants and/or convertibles.If the exercise of the authorisation regarding a new share issue is combined with the exercise of the authorisation regarding the acquisition and transfer of own shares  item 18 on the agenda  in order to finance all or part of the purchase price in one and the same company acquisition  the number of shares transferred and issued during the period until the end of the next Annual General Meeting  together may not exceed one tenth of all shares in the Company at the time of the resolution to authorise a new share issue.MISCELLANEOUSSpecial majority requirementFor valid resolutions in accordance with item 16 and 17 above  it is required that the proposals be supported by at least nine tenths (9/10) of the shares represented and votes cast at the Annual General Meeting.For valid resolutions in accordance with item 18 and 19 above  it is required that the proposals be supported by at least two thirds (2/3) of the shares represented and votes cast at the Annual General Meeting.Number of shares and votesAs per the date of this notice  the total number of outstanding shares and votes in the Company is 205 062 579 of which 203 026 610 are ordinary shares and 2 035 969 are shares of series C.

Item 16 – Resolution to adopt a long-term performance-based share programme for the Group’s senior executives and key employees in Sweden (LTIP 2023) The Board of Directors’ of Hexatronic Group AB (publ) (the “Company”) proposal that the Annual General Meeting resolves on (A.) the adoption of a performance-based share savings programme (“LTIP 2023”) aimed at the Group’s (the “Hexatronic Group”) senior executives and key employees employed in Sweden  and (B.) directed issue of convertible shares of series C  authorisation for the Board of Directors to resolve on repurchases of all issued redeemable and convertible shares of series C and approval of transfer of own ordinary shares to participants A. Introduction of LTIP 2023The Board of Directors of the Company proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to adopt a long-term incentive programme in the form of a performance-based share savings program directed at the Group’s senior executives and other key employees employed in Sweden (“Participants”). LTIP 2023 is proposed to include a maximum of forty-five (45) Participants. Participants in LTIP 2023 must have contributed a private investment through the acquisition of shares in the Company (“Saving Shares”). Subsequently  after a three-year vesting period commencing on the date of entering into an agreement to participate in LTIP 2023 (the “Vesting Period”)  Participants will be given the opportunity to receive ordinary shares (“Performance Shares”) free of charge  subject to the main terms and conditions set forth below. Within the LTIP 2023  the Company will award Participants conditional share rights (“Share Rights”)  meaning the right  subject to certain conditions being met  to receive up to six (6) Performance Shares per Share Right free of charge. Background The Company’s Board of Directors is of the opinion that a performance-based share savings program contributes to higher motivation and commitment among employees and strengthens the bonds between the employees and the Company. Furthermore  it is the Board’s assessment that LTIP 2023 will contribute to the opportunities to recruit and retain knowledgeable and experienced employees who hold key positions in the Hexatronic Group and are expected to increase employee interest in the business and earnings development in the Company. LTIP 2023 has been designed on the basis that it is desirable that senior executives and other key employees within the Hexatronic Group are shareholders in the Company and LTIP 2023 rewards the continued loyalty of employees and thereby the long-term value growth in the Company. All in all  it is the Board’s assessment that LTIP 2023 will benefit both the employees and the Company’s shareholders through an increased share value. Private investment In order to participate in LTIP 2023  the Participant must have contributed with a private investment through the acquisition of Saving Shares. The shares shall have been acquired at market prices during the period between 15 May 2023 and 30 June 2023 for the purpose of being allocated to LTIP 2023  unless the Board of Directors allows exceptions in the individual case regarding shares acquired previously. The Board of Directors also has the right to thereafter  for individual additional Participants (new employees or promoted)  postpone the last day for the acquisition of Savings Shares (see more below under “Additional participants”). The maximum number of Saving Shares that a Participant can allocate to LTIP 2023 amounts to a rounded number of shares corresponding to a maximum of ten (10) per cent of the Participant’s annual gross basic salary calculated on the basis of the 2023 salary level and depending on the position in the Hexatronic Group. The minimum number of Saving Shares that a Participant must acquire to participate in LTIP 2023 shall correspond to a market value of at least five (5) per cent of the annual gross basic salary. For each Saving Share held within the LTIP 2023  the Company will grant Participants a Share Right  meaning the right  subject to certain conditions being met  to receive up to two  four or six Performance Shares per Share Right free of charge  depending on the position in the Hexatronic Group. Terms and conditions In addition to the requirement that the Participant’s employment and holding of Saving Shares shall continue throughout the Vesting Period  certain performance-based conditions linked to diluted earnings per share  Hexatronic Group growth and EBITA are imposed for the allotment of Performance Shares to the Participants. The Participants are divided into three categories and LTIP 2023 will involve the allocation of the maximum number of Performance Shares per Saving Share as follows: Category Maximum number of Performance Shares per Saving Share CEO and the management team (a total of approximately 10 persons) 6 Other senior executives (a total of approximately 25 persons) 4 Other key employees (a total of approximately 10 persons) 2 Allotment free of charge of Performance Shares is  in addition to what is stated in the paragraph above  conditional on the achievement of the performance targets set by the Board of Directors. For maximum allotment of Performance Shares  it is required that the goals set by the Board of Directors are achieved or exceeded. The performance targets refer to (i) diluted earnings per share for the respective financial year 2023-2025 (the “Share Target”)  (ii) net sales growth for each financial year 2023-2025 (the “Growth Target”); and (iii) EBITA for the respective financial year 2023-2025 (the “EBITA Target”) (collectively  the “Performance Targets”)  whereby the respective Performance Targets shall be weighted by 1/3 each. If the minimum level is not reached  no Performance Shares related to the current Performance Target for the financial year will be vested and if the upper target level is reached  all Performance Shares arising from the current Performance Target for the financial year will be earned. In the event of an outcome between the minimum level and the upper target level  the earnings of the Performance Shares arising from the current Performance Target for the financial year will be made linearly. The final number of Performance Shares earned by each Participant shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number. The Share Target The Share Target relates to the development of the Company’s diluted earnings per share during the period from the date of the Annual General Meeting 2023 up to and including 31 December 2025. For each financial year  a minimum level and a maximum level of earnings per share have been set for the allotment of Performance Shares. In the event of an outcome between the minimum level and the upper target level  earnings of the Performance Shares arising from the current Performance Target for the financial year will be made linearly in the range of SEK 4.40–5.40 earnings per share (financial year 2023)  SEK 5.20–6.20 earnings per share (financial year 2024)  SEK 6.10–7.10 earnings per share (financial year 2025). The Growth Target The Growth Target for each financial year has been set by the Board of Directors as a percentage measure of increased sales per financial year during LTIP 2023 compared to the Company’s established net sales for the financial year 2022. For each financial year  a minimum level and an upper target level have been set corresponding to twenty (20) per cent and forty (40) per cent  respectively  for 2023  fifteen (15) per cent and twenty-five (25) per cent  respectively  for 2024 and fifteen (15) per cent and twenty-five (25) per cent  respectively  for 2025. The EBITA Target The EBITA Target for each financial year has been set by the Board of Directors as a percentage measure of increased EBITA per financial year during LTIP 2023 compared to the Company’s established EBITA for the financial year 2022. For each year  a weighted minimum level has been set for each financial year  which for the financial years 2023  2024 and 2025 corresponds to twelve (12.0) per cent and a weighted upper target level of eighteeen (18.0) per cent  respectively. Terms and conditions of the Share Rights In addition to what is stated above  the following conditions shall apply to the Share Rights under LTIP 2023: (a) The Participant must acquire the Saving Shares prior to the beginning of the Vesting Period or  in the case of subsequent additional Participants  at the time determined by the Company’s Remuneration Committee. (b) The Share Rights are vested during the Vesting Period or  in the case of subsequent additional Participants  proportionately  rounded down  calculated linearly on a full-year basis depending on when the additional Participant joins LTIP 2023. (c) The Share Rights cannot be transferred or pledged. (d) Each Share Right entitles the Participant  under certain conditions  to receive up to six Performance Shares free of charge  depending on the position within the Hexatronic Group (see more on this above under “Terms and Conditions”)  after the end of the Vesting Period  provided that  subject to certain exceptions  the Participant has been employed in the Hexatronic Group during the Vesting Period and retains his or her original Saving Shares in the Company. Additional participants In the event that a Participant  following a resolution by the Company’s Remuneration Committee  is added after 30 June 2023  when calculating the maximum number of Saving Shares that the Participant may acquire  the Participant’s annual gross basic salary at the current time and a share price corresponding to the average of the average volume-weighted purchase price of the Company’s share on Nasdaq Stockholm during a period of ten trading days after the announcement of the quarterly report for the Company that is published immediately before the decision to allow the additional Participant to participate  rounded to the nearest SEK 0.10. For Saving Shares held by additional Participants within the LTIP 2023  the Company will award Share Rights proportionately  rounded down  calculated linearly on a full-year basis depending on when the additional Participant joins LTIP 2023. Additional Participants will be allotted Performance Shares no earlier than three (3) years after the Participant entered into an agreement to join LTIP 2023. Allotment of Performance Shares In order to be able to complete LTIP 2023 in a cost-effective and flexible manner  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves  in accordance with item B below  that the Company’s commitments for delivery of and costs attributable to Performance Shares are primarily secured through a directed issue of a maximum of 261 071 shares of series C to Danske Bank A/S  Danske Bank filial Sverige (the “Bank”)  of which a maximum of 62 417 shares of series C may be issued to cover any social security contributions  with subsequent repurchases and conversion into ordinary shares and decisions on the transfer of own ordinary shares to senior executives and other key employees within the Hexatronic Group. The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves that a maximum of 198 654 ordinary shares may be transferred to Participants in accordance with LTIP 2023 and that a maximum of 62 417 ordinary shares may be transferred on the market to secure social security contributions in connection with LTIP 2023 (“Hedging Shares”). Costs for LTIP 2023 Costs for LTIP 2023 are calculated in accordance with IFRS2 and are reported over the income statement. The cost is reported linearly over the Vesting Period. Based on the assumptions that LTIP 2023 will be fully subscribed by forty-five (45) Participants  that all of these invest the maximum amount allowed in Saving Shares in LTIP 2023  that the share price amounts to SEK one hundred and thirty-eight (138) at the time of investment  and that all Saving Shares remain at LTIP 2023’s end  this means a total cost for LTIP 2023 of approximately SEK 32 million  provided that the Performance Targets are fully achieved. The above amount also includes social security contributions  which are currently payable at a nominal rate of 31.42 per cent. With an assumed share price at LTIP 2023’s end of SEK two hundred seven (207) and otherwise with conditions as above  the social security contributions are estimated to amount to approximately SEK thirteen (13) million  provided that the Performance Targets are fully achieved. If the Performance Targets are achieved so that half of the Performance Shares are allocated to the Participants  the corresponding total cost is estimated to amount to SEK 15.2 million. LTIP 2023 has no limit on maximum profit for Participants and therefore no maximum cost of social security contributions can be calculated. Effects on key performance indicators and dilution LTIP 2023 is expected to comprise a maximum of 198 654 Performance Shares and 62 417 Hedging Shares for social security contributions  excluding the Saving Shares  corresponding to approximately 0.13 per cent of the Company’s total number of outstanding shares after full exercise of ongoing and now resolved incentive programme. Outstanding rights to shares under previous long-term incentive programmes and the proposed long-term incentive programme amount to approximately 2.51 per cent of the Company’s total number of outstanding shares upon full exercise. Ongoing incentive programmes including LTIP 2023 are expected to have only marginal impact on significant key performance indicators. Additional ongoing share-based incentive programmes For a description of the Company’s ongoing long-term incentive programmes  please refer to the Annual Report for 2022 which is available on the Company’s website  https://group.hexatronic.com/ . Preparation of the proposal LTIP 2023 has been prepared by the Board of Directors in consultation with the remuneration committee and external advisers. The Board of Directors or a special committee set up by the Board of Directors shall be responsible for the detailed design and management of the terms and conditions for LTIP 2023  in accordance with the above-mentioned terms and conditions including provisions on recalculation in the event of an in-between bonus issue  share split  rights issue and/or other similar events. In connection therewith  the Board of Directors shall have the right to make adjustments to meet specific market conditions. The Board of Directors shall also have the right to make other adjustments if there are significant changes in the Hexatronic Group or its operating environment that would result in the adopted terms and conditions for LTIP 2023 no longer fulfilling its purposes. B. Directed issue of convertible shares of series C  authorisation for the Board of Directors to resolve on the repurchase of all issued redeemable and convertible shares of series C  and transfer of own ordinary shares to Participants in accordance with LTIP 2023In order to be able to carry out LTIP 2023 in a cost-effective and flexible manner  the Board of Directors proposes that the Company’s commitments for delivery of and costs attributable to Performance Shares be secured primarily through a directed issue of convertible shares of series C  with subsequent repurchases and conversion into ordinary shares and resolution on the transfer of own ordinary shares to Participants. The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting instruct the Board of Directors to implement the decision above and to ensure that the Board of Directors transfers the Performance Shares in accordance with what is stated above. The Board further proposes that the Annual General Meeting instruct the Board  or whomever the Board appoints  to make such minor adjustments in the abovementioned proposed resolution that may prove necessary in connection with registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office. Item 17 – Resolution to adopt a long-term incentive programme for the Group’s employees outside of Sweden (Warrant programme 2023) The Board of Directors’ of Hexatronic Group AB (publ) (the “Company”) proposal that the Annual General Meeting resolves on (A.) the adoption of a long-term incentive programme (Warrant Programme 2023) directed at the Group’s (the “Hexatronic Group”) employees outside of Sweden  and (B.) a directed issue of warrants (Series 2023/2026) to the wholly owned subsidiary Proximion AB (“Proximion”) and approval of the transfer of these warrants to participants A. Introduction of Warrant Programme 2023 The Board of Directors of the Company proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to adopt a long-term incentive programme directed at the Group’s senior executives and certain key employees employed outside of Sweden in accordance with the main terms and conditions set out below. Background The Company’s Board of Directors is of the opinion that the Warrant Programme 2023 will contribute to higher motivation and commitment among employees and strengthen the bonds between the employees and the Company. Furthermore  it is the Board’s assessment that the Warrant Programme 2023 will contribute to the opportunities to recruit and retain knowledgeable and experienced employees and is expected to increase employee interest in the business and earnings development in the Company. All in all  it is the Board’s assessment that the Warrant Programme 2023 will be beneficial for both the employees and for the Company’s shareholders through an increased share value. Warrant Programme 2023 The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves on a directed share issue of a maximum of 441 000 warrants (hereinafter referred to as “Warrants”) and the subsequent transfer of a total of not more than 441 000 Warrants. The right to subscribe for Warrants shall only vest with Proximion  with the right and obligation for Proximion to manage the Warrants in accordance with the terms of the Warrant Programme 2023 and transfer the Warrants to participants free of charge. Each Warrant entitles the holder to subscribe for one ordinary share. The Warrants shall be issued free of charge to Proximion. Participants in the Warrant Programme 2023 shall  upon receipt of the offer  but no later than 31 May 2023  notify Proximion of the number of Warrants that the participant wishes to receive. In the event that the participants’ employment ends during the term of the Warrants  the Warrants shall be returned without consideration or other remuneration. Subscription of ordinary shares shall be possible during the period from and including 15 May 2026 up to and including 15 June 2026. The subscription price for ordinary shares subscribed for pursuant to the Warrants shall be set at 135 per cent of the volume-weighted average share price of the Hexatronic share during the measurement period from and including 9 May 2023 up to and including 20 May 2023. The subscription price shall be paid in cash or by set-off. The Company shall have the right  but not the obligation  at the request of participants who are unable to pay subscription proceeds in cash  to acquire at market price such number of Warrants as enable the participant to exercise the remaining Warrants to subscribe for ordinary shares  whereby the subscription proceeds are paid by offsetting against the receivable on divested Warrants. The exercise price  as set out above  shall be rounded to the nearest SEK 0.10  whereby SEK 0.05 shall be rounded downwards. The exercise price and the number of shares that each Warrant entitles to subscription for shall be recalculated in the event of a split  consolidation  new share issue etc. in accordance with market practice. Allocation of Warrants The Warrant Programme 2023 shall comprise approximately 40 senior executives  and approximately 70 key employees  employed in England  Belgium  Norway  Denmark  Finland  USA  Canada  Germany  Estonia  Latvia  Lithuania  Italy  Australia  South Korea  Netherlands  New Zealand and Austria and in total relate to a maximum of 441 000 Warrants. The maximum number of Warrants per participant in the Warrant Programme 2023 is shown in the table below. Category Maximum number of Warrants per person Maximum number of Warrants per category Senior executives approximately 9 000 approximately 235 000 Remaining key employees approximately 3 000 approximately 206 000 In the event of changes in positions and employments  remaining Warrants in one category may be used in another category. The Board of Directors may decide that such Warrants that are not allotted in accordance with the above shall later be allocated to any new employees within the Hexatronic Group. Effects on key performance indicators and costs The Warrants are issued free of charge to the participants and may incur social security contributions and costs in accordance with the accounting rules in IFRS2. The Board estimates that these costs will be limited. Since the Company’s costs for the Warrant Programme 2023 will be relatively limited  the Board of Directors has decided not to propose to the Annual General Meeting to decide on measures to cover these. Ongoing incentive programmes including Warrant Programme 2023 are expected to have only marginal impact on significant key performance indicators. Dilution Based on the existing number of ordinary shares in the Company  the Warrant Programme 2023  upon full exercise of all 441 000 Warrants  entails a dilution corresponding to approximately 0.22 per cent of the capital and votes related to ordinary shares. If all outstanding incentive programmes in the Company are included in the calculation  the corresponding maximum dilution  at the time of the Annual General Meeting  amounts to approximately 2.6 per cent of the capital and the number of votes related to ordinary shares. Additional ongoing share-based incentive programmes For a description of the Company’s ongoing long-term incentive programmes  please refer to the Annual Report for 2022 which is available on the Company’s website  https://group.hexatronic.com. Preparation of the proposal The Warrant Programme 2023 has been prepared by the Board of Directors in consultation with company management and external advisors. The Board of Directors or a special committee set up by the Board of Directors shall be responsible for the detailed design and management of the terms and conditions for the Warrant Programme 2023  in accordance with the above-mentioned terms and conditions including provisions on recalculation in the event of an in-between bonus issue  share split  rights issue and/or other similar events. In connection therewith  the Board of Directors shall have the right to make adjustments to meet specific market conditions. The Board of Directors shall also have the right to make other adjustments if there are significant changes in the Hexatronic Group or its operating environment that would result in the decided terms of the Warrant Programme 2023 no longer fulfilling its purposes. B. Directed issue of warrants  Series 2023/2026  to the wholly owned subsidiary Proximion AB  and approval of their transfer to participants under the Warrant Programme 2023 The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to issue not more than 441 000 Warrants  as a result of which the Company’s share capital may increase by a maximum of SEK 4 410. The following conditions shall apply. The right to subscribe for Warrants shall  with deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights  vest with Proximion AB  which shall then transfer the Warrants to the appropriate participants in the Warrant Programme 2023. Each Warrant entitles the holder to subscribe for one share. The Warrants shall be issued free of charge to Proximion. Each warrant entitles the holder to subscribe for one new ordinary share in Hexatronic Group AB (publ) during the period from and including 15 May 2026 up to and including 15 June 2026 at a subscription price of 135 per cent of the volume-weighted average share price of the Hexatronic share during the measurement period from and including 9 May 2023 up to and including 20 May 2023. The Board of Directors has the right to extend the subscription period  but no more than six months. The exercise price and the number of shares that each Warrant entitles to subscription of shall be recalculated in the event of a split  reverse share split  new issue of shares  etc. in accordance with market practice. The amount that  in the case of share subscription  exceeds the quota value shall be transferred to the free premium fund. Subscription of Warrants must be made on the subscription list no later than 31 May 2023. However  the Board of Directors shall have the right to extend the subscription period. The Warrants are issued free of charge to Proximion. New shares pursuant to subscription entitle to dividends for the first time on the record date for dividends that occurs immediately after subscription has been effected. The warrants shall in all other respects be governed by the terms and conditions set forth in Appendix A. The Board of Directors also proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to approve that Proximion AB  in accordance with the incentive programme  may transfer Warrants to participants in the Warrant Programme 2023 and manage Warrants in accordance with the Warrant Programme 2023. Proximion AB shall have the right to retain such Warrants that are not allotted in accordance with the above for later allotment to additional employees within the Hexatronic Group as decided by the Company’s Board of Directors. It is further proposed that the Board of Directors  or whomever they appoint  should be authorised to undertake such minor adjustments in the decision that may be required for the registration with the Companies Registration Office. Oversubscription cannot take place. The rationale for the deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights is to implement incentive programmes for employees outside of Sweden in the Hexatronic Group. The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting instruct the Board of Directors to implement the decisions above and to ensure that the Board of Directors in Proximion transfers the Warrants in accordance with what is stated above. The Board further proposes that the Annual General Meeting instruct the Board  or whomever the Board appoints  to make such minor adjustments in the abovementioned proposed resolutions that may prove necessary in connection with registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office. Item 18 – Resolution to authorise the Board of Directors to resolve on the acquire and transfer of own shares The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to authorise the Board of Directors  for the period until the end of the next Annual General Meeting  on one or several occasions  to resolve to acquire the Company’s own shares. The Board of Directors further proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to authorise the Board of Directors  for the period until the end of the next Annual General Meeting  on one or several occasions  to resolve to transfer the own shares held by the Company at the time of the Board of Directors’ decision on transfer. The following conditions shall apply. Shares may be acquired to the extent that the Company’s holding of its own shares  on any occasion  does not exceed ten (10) per cent of the Company’s total outstanding shares. The shares may be acquired through an offer directed at all shareholders or through trading on Nasdaq Stockholm. When trading on Nasdaq Stockholm the price shall correspond to the price interval registered at any given time  by which is meant the interval between the highest purchase price and the lowest sale price. Acquisition offers directed at all shareholders may only be made for consideration in cash and shall be made at a price corresponding to the registered price interval at any given time with a maximum deviation of 30 per cent upwards. The purpose of the proposed authorisation is to give the Board the opportunity to adapt the Company’s capital structure to its capital needs and thereby  among other things  be able to use the repurchased shares as a means of payment for the acquisition of companies. Transfer of own shares may be made through trading on Nasdaq Stockholm at a price within the price interval registered at any given time  which means the interval between the highest purchase price and the lowest sale price. Transfer of shares acquired in accordance with the above may also take place outside Nasdaq Stockholm  with or without deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights and with or without provisions on non-cash consideration or right of set-off. Transfer of own shares may  for example  be used as a means of payment in connection with company acquisitions on terms in accordance with the Swedish Companies Act’s rules on new issues. Such transfer may be made at a price in cash  or value  of property obtained  which  in the case of a business combination  corresponds to the stock exchange price at the time of the transfer. If the exercise of the authorisation regarding the acquisition and transfer of own shares is combined with the exercise of the authorisation regarding the new issue of shares  warrants and/or convertibles  item 19 on the agenda  for the purpose of financing all or part of the purchase price in the event of one and the same business acquisition or one and the same investment in connection with the conclusion of a new contract or the start-up of a new business area  the number of shares transferred and financial instruments issued during the period until the end of the next Annual General Meeting  together may not exceed one tenth of all outstanding shares in the Company at the time of the resolution authorizing a new issue. The possibility of deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights when transferring own shares is justified by the fact that transfer of shares over Nasdaq Stockholm or otherwise with deviation from preferential rights for shareholders can take place with greater speed  flexibility and is more cost-effective than transfer to all shareholders. If the Company’s own shares are transferred for consideration in a form other than cash in connection with agreements on the acquisition of assets  the Company cannot give shareholders the opportunity to exercise any preferential rights. The Board of Directors  or any person appointed by the Board of Directors  shall have the right to make any adjustments or amendments of the above resolution which may be required in connection with the registration of such resolution and to take any other measure deemed necessary for the execution of the resolution. Item 19 – Resolution to authorise the Board of Directors to resolve on new issues of shares  warrants and/or convertibles The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to authorise the Board of Directors  for the period until the end of the next Annual General Meeting  on one or several occasions and with or without deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights  to resolve on new share issues  warrants and/or convertibles corresponding to not more than ten (10) per cent of the registered share capital in the Company at the time of the issue resolution. The authorisation may be utilised for new issues  which may be made with provisions regarding contribution in cash  in kind or through set-off. A new issue may only be made at market price. In order to enable delivery of shares in connection with a cash issue as described above  this may  if the Board of Directors deems it appropriate  be made at a subscription price corresponding to the quota value of the shares  whereby the issue is directed to an issuing agency acting as a settlement bank for investors.

Item 16 – Resolution to adopt a long-term performance-based share programme for the Group’s senior executives and key employees in Sweden (LTIP 2023) The Board of Directors’ of Hexatronic Group AB (publ) (the “Company”) proposal that the Annual General Meeting resolves on (A.) the adoption of a performance-based share savings programme (“LTIP 2023”) aimed at the Group’s (the “Hexatronic Group”) senior executives and key employees employed in Sweden  and (B.) directed issue of convertible shares of series C  authorisation for the Board of Directors to resolve on repurchases of all issued redeemable and convertible shares of series C and approval of transfer of own ordinary shares to participants A. Introduction of LTIP 2023The Board of Directors of the Company proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to adopt a long-term incentive programme in the form of a performance-based share savings program directed at the Group’s senior executives and other key employees employed in Sweden (“Participants”). LTIP 2023 is proposed to include a maximum of forty-five (45) Participants. Participants in LTIP 2023 must have contributed a private investment through the acquisition of shares in the Company (“Saving Shares”). Subsequently  after a three-year vesting period commencing on the date of entering into an agreement to participate in LTIP 2023 (the “Vesting Period”)  Participants will be given the opportunity to receive ordinary shares (“Performance Shares”) free of charge  subject to the main terms and conditions set forth below. Within the LTIP 2023  the Company will award Participants conditional share rights (“Share Rights”)  meaning the right  subject to certain conditions being met  to receive up to six (6) Performance Shares per Share Right free of charge. Background The Company’s Board of Directors is of the opinion that a performance-based share savings program contributes to higher motivation and commitment among employees and strengthens the bonds between the employees and the Company. Furthermore  it is the Board’s assessment that LTIP 2023 will contribute to the opportunities to recruit and retain knowledgeable and experienced employees who hold key positions in the Hexatronic Group and are expected to increase employee interest in the business and earnings development in the Company. LTIP 2023 has been designed on the basis that it is desirable that senior executives and other key employees within the Hexatronic Group are shareholders in the Company and LTIP 2023 rewards the continued loyalty of employees and thereby the long-term value growth in the Company. All in all  it is the Board’s assessment that LTIP 2023 will benefit both the employees and the Company’s shareholders through an increased share value. Private investment In order to participate in LTIP 2023  the Participant must have contributed with a private investment through the acquisition of Saving Shares. The shares shall have been acquired at market prices during the period between 15 May 2023 and 30 June 2023 for the purpose of being allocated to LTIP 2023  unless the Board of Directors allows exceptions in the individual case regarding shares acquired previously. The Board of Directors also has the right to thereafter  for individual additional Participants (new employees or promoted)  postpone the last day for the acquisition of Savings Shares (see more below under “Additional participants”). The maximum number of Saving Shares that a Participant can allocate to LTIP 2023 amounts to a rounded number of shares corresponding to a maximum of ten (10) per cent of the Participant’s annual gross basic salary calculated on the basis of the 2023 salary level and depending on the position in the Hexatronic Group. The minimum number of Saving Shares that a Participant must acquire to participate in LTIP 2023 shall correspond to a market value of at least five (5) per cent of the annual gross basic salary. For each Saving Share held within the LTIP 2023  the Company will grant Participants a Share Right  meaning the right  subject to certain conditions being met  to receive up to two  four or six Performance Shares per Share Right free of charge  depending on the position in the Hexatronic Group. Terms and conditions In addition to the requirement that the Participant’s employment and holding of Saving Shares shall continue throughout the Vesting Period  certain performance-based conditions linked to diluted earnings per share  Hexatronic Group growth and EBITA are imposed for the allotment of Performance Shares to the Participants. The Participants are divided into three categories and LTIP 2023 will involve the allocation of the maximum number of Performance Shares per Saving Share as follows: Category Maximum number of Performance Shares per Saving Share CEO and the management team (a total of approximately 10 persons) 6 Other senior executives (a total of approximately 25 persons) 4 Other key employees (a total of approximately 10 persons) 2 Allotment free of charge of Performance Shares is  in addition to what is stated in the paragraph above  conditional on the achievement of the performance targets set by the Board of Directors. For maximum allotment of Performance Shares  it is required that the goals set by the Board of Directors are achieved or exceeded. The performance targets refer to (i) diluted earnings per share for the respective financial year 2023-2025 (the “Share Target”)  (ii) net sales growth for each financial year 2023-2025 (the “Growth Target”); and (iii) EBITA for the respective financial year 2023-2025 (the “EBITA Target”) (collectively  the “Performance Targets”)  whereby the respective Performance Targets shall be weighted by 1/3 each. If the minimum level is not reached  no Performance Shares related to the current Performance Target for the financial year will be vested and if the upper target level is reached  all Performance Shares arising from the current Performance Target for the financial year will be earned. In the event of an outcome between the minimum level and the upper target level  the earnings of the Performance Shares arising from the current Performance Target for the financial year will be made linearly. The final number of Performance Shares earned by each Participant shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number. The Share Target The Share Target relates to the development of the Company’s diluted earnings per share during the period from the date of the Annual General Meeting 2023 up to and including 31 December 2025. For each financial year  a minimum level and a maximum level of earnings per share have been set for the allotment of Performance Shares. In the event of an outcome between the minimum level and the upper target level  earnings of the Performance Shares arising from the current Performance Target for the financial year will be made linearly in the range of SEK 4.40–5.40 earnings per share (financial year 2023)  SEK 5.20–6.20 earnings per share (financial year 2024)  SEK 6.10–7.10 earnings per share (financial year 2025). The Growth Target The Growth Target for each financial year has been set by the Board of Directors as a percentage measure of increased sales per financial year during LTIP 2023 compared to the Company’s established net sales for the financial year 2022. For each financial year  a minimum level and an upper target level have been set corresponding to twenty (20) per cent and forty (40) per cent  respectively  for 2023  fifteen (15) per cent and twenty-five (25) per cent  respectively  for 2024 and fifteen (15) per cent and twenty-five (25) per cent  respectively  for 2025. The EBITA Target The EBITA Target for each financial year has been set by the Board of Directors as a percentage measure of increased EBITA per financial year during LTIP 2023 compared to the Company’s established EBITA for the financial year 2022. For each year  a weighted minimum level has been set for each financial year  which for the financial years 2023  2024 and 2025 corresponds to twelve (12.0) per cent and a weighted upper target level of eighteeen (18.0) per cent  respectively. Terms and conditions of the Share Rights In addition to what is stated above  the following conditions shall apply to the Share Rights under LTIP 2023: (a) The Participant must acquire the Saving Shares prior to the beginning of the Vesting Period or  in the case of subsequent additional Participants  at the time determined by the Company’s Remuneration Committee. (b) The Share Rights are vested during the Vesting Period or  in the case of subsequent additional Participants  proportionately  rounded down  calculated linearly on a full-year basis depending on when the additional Participant joins LTIP 2023. (c) The Share Rights cannot be transferred or pledged. (d) Each Share Right entitles the Participant  under certain conditions  to receive up to six Performance Shares free of charge  depending on the position within the Hexatronic Group (see more on this above under “Terms and Conditions”)  after the end of the Vesting Period  provided that  subject to certain exceptions  the Participant has been employed in the Hexatronic Group during the Vesting Period and retains his or her original Saving Shares in the Company. Additional participants In the event that a Participant  following a resolution by the Company’s Remuneration Committee  is added after 30 June 2023  when calculating the maximum number of Saving Shares that the Participant may acquire  the Participant’s annual gross basic salary at the current time and a share price corresponding to the average of the average volume-weighted purchase price of the Company’s share on Nasdaq Stockholm during a period of ten trading days after the announcement of the quarterly report for the Company that is published immediately before the decision to allow the additional Participant to participate  rounded to the nearest SEK 0.10. For Saving Shares held by additional Participants within the LTIP 2023  the Company will award Share Rights proportionately  rounded down  calculated linearly on a full-year basis depending on when the additional Participant joins LTIP 2023. Additional Participants will be allotted Performance Shares no earlier than three (3) years after the Participant entered into an agreement to join LTIP 2023. Allotment of Performance Shares In order to be able to complete LTIP 2023 in a cost-effective and flexible manner  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves  in accordance with item B below  that the Company’s commitments for delivery of and costs attributable to Performance Shares are primarily secured through a directed issue of a maximum of 261 071 shares of series C to Danske Bank A/S  Danske Bank filial Sverige (the “Bank”)  of which a maximum of 62 417 shares of series C may be issued to cover any social security contributions  with subsequent repurchases and conversion into ordinary shares and decisions on the transfer of own ordinary shares to senior executives and other key employees within the Hexatronic Group. The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves that a maximum of 198 654 ordinary shares may be transferred to Participants in accordance with LTIP 2023 and that a maximum of 62 417 ordinary shares may be transferred on the market to secure social security contributions in connection with LTIP 2023 (“Hedging Shares”). Costs for LTIP 2023 Costs for LTIP 2023 are calculated in accordance with IFRS2 and are reported over the income statement. The cost is reported linearly over the Vesting Period. Based on the assumptions that LTIP 2023 will be fully subscribed by forty-five (45) Participants  that all of these invest the maximum amount allowed in Saving Shares in LTIP 2023  that the share price amounts to SEK one hundred and thirty-eight (138) at the time of investment  and that all Saving Shares remain at LTIP 2023’s end  this means a total cost for LTIP 2023 of approximately SEK 32 million  provided that the Performance Targets are fully achieved. The above amount also includes social security contributions  which are currently payable at a nominal rate of 31.42 per cent. With an assumed share price at LTIP 2023’s end of SEK two hundred seven (207) and otherwise with conditions as above  the social security contributions are estimated to amount to approximately SEK thirteen (13) million  provided that the Performance Targets are fully achieved. If the Performance Targets are achieved so that half of the Performance Shares are allocated to the Participants  the corresponding total cost is estimated to amount to SEK 15.2 million. LTIP 2023 has no limit on maximum profit for Participants and therefore no maximum cost of social security contributions can be calculated. Effects on key performance indicators and dilution LTIP 2023 is expected to comprise a maximum of 198 654 Performance Shares and 62 417 Hedging Shares for social security contributions  excluding the Saving Shares  corresponding to approximately 0.13 per cent of the Company’s total number of outstanding shares after full exercise of ongoing and now resolved incentive programme. Outstanding rights to shares under previous long-term incentive programmes and the proposed long-term incentive programme amount to approximately 2.51 per cent of the Company’s total number of outstanding shares upon full exercise. Ongoing incentive programmes including LTIP 2023 are expected to have only marginal impact on significant key performance indicators. Additional ongoing share-based incentive programmes For a description of the Company’s ongoing long-term incentive programmes  please refer to the Annual Report for 2022 which is available on the Company’s website  https://group.hexatronic.com/ . Preparation of the proposal LTIP 2023 has been prepared by the Board of Directors in consultation with the remuneration committee and external advisers. The Board of Directors or a special committee set up by the Board of Directors shall be responsible for the detailed design and management of the terms and conditions for LTIP 2023  in accordance with the above-mentioned terms and conditions including provisions on recalculation in the event of an in-between bonus issue  share split  rights issue and/or other similar events. In connection therewith  the Board of Directors shall have the right to make adjustments to meet specific market conditions. The Board of Directors shall also have the right to make other adjustments if there are significant changes in the Hexatronic Group or its operating environment that would result in the adopted terms and conditions for LTIP 2023 no longer fulfilling its purposes.

Directed issue of convertible shares of series C  authorisation for the Board of Directors to resolve on the repurchase of all issued redeemable and convertible shares of series C  and transfer of own ordinary shares to Participants in accordance with LTIP 2023In order to be able to carry out LTIP 2023 in a cost-effective and flexible manner  the Board of Directors proposes that the Company’s commitments for delivery of and costs attributable to Performance Shares be secured primarily through a directed issue of convertible shares of series C  with subsequent repurchases and conversion into ordinary shares and resolution on the transfer of own ordinary shares to Participants. The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting instruct the Board of Directors to implement the decision above and to ensure that the Board of Directors transfers the Performance Shares in accordance with what is stated above. The Board further proposes that the Annual General Meeting instruct the Board  or whomever the Board appoints  to make such minor adjustments in the abovementioned proposed resolution that may prove necessary in connection with registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office. Item 17 – Resolution to adopt a long-term incentive programme for the Group’s employees outside of Sweden (Warrant programme 2023) The Board of Directors’ of Hexatronic Group AB (publ) (the “Company”) proposal that the Annual General Meeting resolves on (A.) the adoption of a long-term incentive programme (Warrant Programme 2023) directed at the Group’s (the “Hexatronic Group”) employees outside of Sweden  and (B.) a directed issue of warrants (Series 2023/2026) to the wholly owned subsidiary Proximion AB (“Proximion”) and approval of the transfer of these warrants to participants A. Introduction of Warrant Programme 2023 The Board of Directors of the Company proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to adopt a long-term incentive programme directed at the Group’s senior executives and certain key employees employed outside of Sweden in accordance with the main terms and conditions set out below. Background The Company’s Board of Directors is of the opinion that the Warrant Programme 2023 will contribute to higher motivation and commitment among employees and strengthen the bonds between the employees and the Company. Furthermore  it is the Board’s assessment that the Warrant Programme 2023 will contribute to the opportunities to recruit and retain knowledgeable and experienced employees and is expected to increase employee interest in the business and earnings development in the Company. All in all  it is the Board’s assessment that the Warrant Programme 2023 will be beneficial for both the employees and for the Company’s shareholders through an increased share value. Warrant Programme 2023 The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves on a directed share issue of a maximum of 441 000 warrants (hereinafter referred to as “Warrants”) and the subsequent transfer of a total of not more than 441 000 Warrants. The right to subscribe for Warrants shall only vest with Proximion  with the right and obligation for Proximion to manage the Warrants in accordance with the terms of the Warrant Programme 2023 and transfer the Warrants to participants free of charge. Each Warrant entitles the holder to subscribe for one ordinary share. The Warrants shall be issued free of charge to Proximion. Participants in the Warrant Programme 2023 shall  upon receipt of the offer  but no later than 31 May 2023  notify Proximion of the number of Warrants that the participant wishes to receive. In the event that the participants’ employment ends during the term of the Warrants  the Warrants shall be returned without consideration or other remuneration. Subscription of ordinary shares shall be possible during the period from and including 15 May 2026 up to and including 15 June 2026. The subscription price for ordinary shares subscribed for pursuant to the Warrants shall be set at 135 per cent of the volume-weighted average share price of the Hexatronic share during the measurement period from and including 9 May 2023 up to and including 20 May 2023. The subscription price shall be paid in cash or by set-off. The Company shall have the right  but not the obligation  at the request of participants who are unable to pay subscription proceeds in cash  to acquire at market price such number of Warrants as enable the participant to exercise the remaining Warrants to subscribe for ordinary shares  whereby the subscription proceeds are paid by offsetting against the receivable on divested Warrants. The exercise price  as set out above  shall be rounded to the nearest SEK 0.10  whereby SEK 0.05 shall be rounded downwards. The exercise price and the number of shares that each Warrant entitles to subscription for shall be recalculated in the event of a split  consolidation  new share issue etc. in accordance with market practice. Allocation of Warrants The Warrant Programme 2023 shall comprise approximately 40 senior executives  and approximately 70 key employees  employed in England  Belgium  Norway  Denmark  Finland  USA  Canada  Germany  Estonia  Latvia  Lithuania  Italy  Australia  South Korea  Netherlands  New Zealand and Austria and in total relate to a maximum of 441 000 Warrants. The maximum number of Warrants per participant in the Warrant Programme 2023 is shown in the table below. Category Maximum number of Warrants per person Maximum number of Warrants per category Senior executives approximately 9 000 approximately 235 000 Remaining key employees approximately 3 000 approximately 206 000 In the event of changes in positions and employments  remaining Warrants in one category may be used in another category. The Board of Directors may decide that such Warrants that are not allotted in accordance with the above shall later be allocated to any new employees within the Hexatronic Group. Effects on key performance indicators and costs The Warrants are issued free of charge to the participants and may incur social security contributions and costs in accordance with the accounting rules in IFRS2. The Board estimates that these costs will be limited. Since the Company’s costs for the Warrant Programme 2023 will be relatively limited  the Board of Directors has decided not to propose to the Annual General Meeting to decide on measures to cover these. Ongoing incentive programmes including Warrant Programme 2023 are expected to have only marginal impact on significant key performance indicators. Dilution Based on the existing number of ordinary shares in the Company  the Warrant Programme 2023  upon full exercise of all 441 000 Warrants  entails a dilution corresponding to approximately 0.22 per cent of the capital and votes related to ordinary shares. If all outstanding incentive programmes in the Company are included in the calculation  the corresponding maximum dilution  at the time of the Annual General Meeting  amounts to approximately 2.6 per cent of the capital and the number of votes related to ordinary shares. Additional ongoing share-based incentive programmes For a description of the Company’s ongoing long-term incentive programmes  please refer to the Annual Report for 2022 which is available on the Company’s website  https://group.hexatronic.com. Preparation of the proposal The Warrant Programme 2023 has been prepared by the Board of Directors in consultation with company management and external advisors. The Board of Directors or a special committee set up by the Board of Directors shall be responsible for the detailed design and management of the terms and conditions for the Warrant Programme 2023  in accordance with the above-mentioned terms and conditions including provisions on recalculation in the event of an in-between bonus issue  share split  rights issue and/or other similar events. In connection therewith  the Board of Directors shall have the right to make adjustments to meet specific market conditions. The Board of Directors shall also have the right to make other adjustments if there are significant changes in the Hexatronic Group or its operating environment that would result in the decided terms of the Warrant Programme 2023 no longer fulfilling its purposes. B. Directed issue of warrants  Series 2023/2026  to the wholly owned subsidiary Proximion AB  and approval of their transfer to participants under the Warrant Programme 2023 The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to issue not more than 441 000 Warrants  as a result of which the Company’s share capital may increase by a maximum of SEK 4 410. The following conditions shall apply. The right to subscribe for Warrants shall  with deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights  vest with Proximion AB  which shall then transfer the Warrants to the appropriate participants in the Warrant Programme 2023. Each Warrant entitles the holder to subscribe for one share. The Warrants shall be issued free of charge to Proximion. Each warrant entitles the holder to subscribe for one new ordinary share in Hexatronic Group AB (publ) during the period from and including 15 May 2026 up to and including 15 June 2026 at a subscription price of 135 per cent of the volume-weighted average share price of the Hexatronic share during the measurement period from and including 9 May 2023 up to and including 20 May 2023. The Board of Directors has the right to extend the subscription period  but no more than six months. The exercise price and the number of shares that each Warrant entitles to subscription of shall be recalculated in the event of a split  reverse share split  new issue of shares  etc. in accordance with market practice. The amount that  in the case of share subscription  exceeds the quota value shall be transferred to the free premium fund. Subscription of Warrants must be made on the subscription list no later than 31 May 2023. However  the Board of Directors shall have the right to extend the subscription period. The Warrants are issued free of charge to Proximion. New shares pursuant to subscription entitle to dividends for the first time on the record date for dividends that occurs immediately after subscription has been effected. The warrants shall in all other respects be governed by the terms and conditions set forth in Appendix A. The Board of Directors also proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to approve that Proximion AB  in accordance with the incentive programme  may transfer Warrants to participants in the Warrant Programme 2023 and manage Warrants in accordance with the Warrant Programme 2023. Proximion AB shall have the right to retain such Warrants that are not allotted in accordance with the above for later allotment to additional employees within the Hexatronic Group as decided by the Company’s Board of Directors. It is further proposed that the Board of Directors  or whomever they appoint  should be authorised to undertake such minor adjustments in the decision that may be required for the registration with the Companies Registration Office. Oversubscription cannot take place. The rationale for the deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights is to implement incentive programmes for employees outside of Sweden in the Hexatronic Group. The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting instruct the Board of Directors to implement the decisions above and to ensure that the Board of Directors in Proximion transfers the Warrants in accordance with what is stated above. The Board further proposes that the Annual General Meeting instruct the Board  or whomever the Board appoints  to make such minor adjustments in the abovementioned proposed resolutions that may prove necessary in connection with registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office. Item 18 – Resolution to authorise the Board of Directors to resolve on the acquire and transfer of own shares The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to authorise the Board of Directors  for the period until the end of the next Annual General Meeting  on one or several occasions  to resolve to acquire the Company’s own shares. The Board of Directors further proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to authorise the Board of Directors  for the period until the end of the next Annual General Meeting  on one or several occasions  to resolve to transfer the own shares held by the Company at the time of the Board of Directors’ decision on transfer. The following conditions shall apply. Shares may be acquired to the extent that the Company’s holding of its own shares  on any occasion  does not exceed ten (10) per cent of the Company’s total outstanding shares. The shares may be acquired through an offer directed at all shareholders or through trading on Nasdaq Stockholm. When trading on Nasdaq Stockholm the price shall correspond to the price interval registered at any given time  by which is meant the interval between the highest purchase price and the lowest sale price. Acquisition offers directed at all shareholders may only be made for consideration in cash and shall be made at a price corresponding to the registered price interval at any given time with a maximum deviation of 30 per cent upwards. The purpose of the proposed authorisation is to give the Board the opportunity to adapt the Company’s capital structure to its capital needs and thereby  among other things  be able to use the repurchased shares as a means of payment for the acquisition of companies. Transfer of own shares may be made through trading on Nasdaq Stockholm at a price within the price interval registered at any given time  which means the interval between the highest purchase price and the lowest sale price. Transfer of shares acquired in accordance with the above may also take place outside Nasdaq Stockholm  with or without deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights and with or without provisions on non-cash consideration or right of set-off. Transfer of own shares may  for example  be used as a means of payment in connection with company acquisitions on terms in accordance with the Swedish Companies Act’s rules on new issues. Such transfer may be made at a price in cash  or value  of property obtained  which  in the case of a business combination  corresponds to the stock exchange price at the time of the transfer. If the exercise of the authorisation regarding the acquisition and transfer of own shares is combined with the exercise of the authorisation regarding the new issue of shares  warrants and/or convertibles  item 19 on the agenda  for the purpose of financing all or part of the purchase price in the event of one and the same business acquisition or one and the same investment in connection with the conclusion of a new contract or the start-up of a new business area  the number of shares transferred and financial instruments issued during the period until the end of the next Annual General Meeting  together may not exceed one tenth of all outstanding shares in the Company at the time of the resolution authorizing a new issue. The possibility of deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights when transferring own shares is justified by the fact that transfer of shares over Nasdaq Stockholm or otherwise with deviation from preferential rights for shareholders can take place with greater speed  flexibility and is more cost-effective than transfer to all shareholders. If the Company’s own shares are transferred for consideration in a form other than cash in connection with agreements on the acquisition of assets  the Company cannot give shareholders the opportunity to exercise any preferential rights. The Board of Directors  or any person appointed by the Board of Directors  shall have the right to make any adjustments or amendments of the above resolution which may be required in connection with the registration of such resolution and to take any other measure deemed necessary for the execution of the resolution. Item 19 – Resolution to authorise the Board of Directors to resolve on new issues of shares  warrants and/or convertibles The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to authorise the Board of Directors  for the period until the end of the next Annual General Meeting  on one or several occasions and with or without deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights  to resolve on new share issues  warrants and/or convertibles corresponding to not more than ten (10) per cent of the registered share capital in the Company at the time of the issue resolution. The authorisation may be utilised for new issues  which may be made with provisions regarding contribution in cash  in kind or through set-off. A new issue may only be made at market price. In order to enable delivery of shares in connection with a cash issue as described above  this may  if the Board of Directors deems it appropriate  be made at a subscription price corresponding to the quota value of the shares  whereby the issue is directed to an issuing agency acting as a settlement bank for investors. Deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights shall only be possible in connection with company acquisitions. If the Board of Directors resolves on an issue with deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights  the rationale shall be that the Company quickly needs access to capital in the event of a company acquisition or alternatively need to pay with the Company’s shares  warrants and/or convertibles. If the exercise of the authorisation regarding a new share issue is combined with the exercise of the authorisation regarding the acquisition and transfer of own shares  item 18 on the agenda  in order to finance all or part of the purchase price in one and the same company acquisition  the number of shares transferred and issued during the period until the end of the next Annual General Meeting  together may not exceed one tenth of all shares in the Company at the time of the resolution to authorise a new share issue.

The Tender Offer is being made in accordance with the disclosure and procedural requirements of Finnish law  including with respect to the Tender Offer timetable  settlement procedures  withdrawal  waiver of conditions and timing of payments  which are different from those of the United States. In particular  any financial information included in this release has been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards in Finland (including International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union)  which may not be comparable to the financial statements or financial information of U.S. companies.To the extent permissible under applicable law or regulations  the Offeror and its affiliates or its brokers and its brokers' affiliates (acting as agents for the Offeror or its affiliates  as applicable) may from time to time and during the pendency of the Tender Offer  and other than pursuant to the Tender Offer  directly or indirectly purchase or arrange to purchase Shares or any securities that are convertible into  exchangeable for or exercisable for Shares. These purchases may occur either in the open market at prevailing prices or in private transactions at negotiated prices. To the extent information about such purchases or arrangements to purchase is made public in Finland  such information will be disclosed by means of a press release or other means reasonably calculated to inform U.S. shareholders of Caverion of such information.

U.S. shareholders may not be able to sue a foreign company or its officers or directors in a foreign court for violations of the U.S. securities laws  and it may be difficult to compel a foreign company and its affiliates to subject themselves to a U.S. court's judgement.Forward-looking statementsThis stock exchange release contains statements that  to the extent they are not historical facts  constitute ""forward-looking statements"".

The guidelines also encompass any remuneration to board members  other than board fees. The guidelines shall apply to remuneration agreed  and amendments to remuneration already agreed  after adoption of the guidelines by the 2023 annual general meeting. The guidelines do not apply to any remuneration resolved by the general meeting.The guidelines' promotion of the company's business strategy  long-term interests and sustainabilityMunters business strategy is to be a global leader in energy-efficient and sustainable climate solutions. Our solutions enable energy efficient production processes with reduced carbon dioxide emissions for our customers. Using innovative technologies  Munters creates the perfect climate for demanding and sophisticated industrial applications and processes  of which the largest segments are industry  defense  data centers  food  pharmaceuticals  and agriculture.Munters conducts operations in three business areas:AirTech is a global leader in energy-efficient air treatment for industrial and commercial fields of application.FoodTech is one of the world's leading suppliers of innovative and energy-efficient climate systems for livestock farming and greenhouses  as well as software for controlling and optimising the entire food production value chain.Data Center Technologies is a leading supplier of advanced climate cooling solutions using a wide range of heat rejection technologies that create sustainable climate solutions for data center operators worldwide.For further information regarding Munters business strategy  see Munters website (https://www.munters.com/en/about-us/munters-in-short/).A prerequisite for the successful implementation of Munters business strategy and safeguarding of the company's long-term interests  including its sustainability  as well as delivery on the ambitions the company has  is that the company is able to recruit and retain qualified personnel. In order to do so  Munters must be able to offer a competitive total remuneration based on market terms  which these guidelines enable.Munters has implemented long-term share-related incentive programs in 2017-2020  in which some senior executives have had the opportunity to participate. These programs have been resolved by each general meeting and are therefore excluded from these guidelines. For information regarding performance criteria  terms and conditions  and costs for these programs  see the board of directors' complete proposal for each general meeting on Munters website and in Munters annual report.Variable cash remuneration covered by these guidelines shall aim to promote the company's business strategy and long-term interests  including its sustainability.Types of remuneration  etc.The remuneration shall be on market terms and may consist of the following components: fixed annual cash salary  variable cash salary  pension and other benefits. Additionally  the general meeting may - irrespective of these guidelines - resolve on  for example  share and share price-related remuneration.Fixed cash salaryThe fixed cash salary shall reflect the demands and responsibility that the position entails as well as individual performance. The fixed cash salary shall be revised annually.Variable cash salaryVariable cash salary may consist of annual variable cash salary and / or long-term variable cash salary.The annual variable cash salary shall be maximized to 50 per cent of the fixed annual cash salary for the CEO and other senior executives. The satisfaction of criteria for awarding variable cash salary shall be measured over a period of one year.The annual variable cash salary shall be linked to predetermined and measurable financial criteria  such as operating result and working capital. By linking the remuneration of the senior executives to the company's earnings and financing of its operating activities  the criteria promote the implementation of the company's business strategy and long-term interests  including its sustainability. Furthermore  the criteria for variable cash salary shall be designed so that they do not encourage excessive risk taking.The long-term variable cash salary shall be awarded after one  two  and three years  respectively  and shall be maximized to a total of 150 per cent of the annual fixed cash salary for the CEO  and 55percent of the annual fixed cash salary for other members of group management  distributed pro-rata over the three years. The satisfaction of criteria for pay out of long-term variable cash salary shall be measured during a one-  two- and three-year period  respectively  before pay out.The long-term variable cash salary shall be linked to predetermined and measurable financial criteria (weighting 70 per cent) and non-financial criteria (weighting 30 per cent). The financial criteria may consist of  for example  adjusted EBITA and Operating Working Capital and the non-financial criteria may consist of  for example  weighted sustainability goals (such as annual increase in the share of electricity from renewable sources in our production facilities  annual share of female managers who have been appointed within the group  as well as annual service growth). By linking the remuneration of the senior executives to the company's earnings  financing of day-to-day operations  and sustainability  the criteria promote the implementation of the company's business strategy and long-term interests  including its sustainability. The criteria for long-term variable cash salary shall be designed so that they do not encourage excessive risk-taking.A certain part of the net amount after tax of paid out long-term variable cash salary is expected to be invested in Munters shares  according to the share ownership policy which the board has adopted. The entire net amount after tax is expected to be invested in Munters shares until the holding in value corresponds to 200 per cent of the gross annual fixed cash salary for the CEO and 100 per cent of the gross annual fixed cash salary for other members of group management. When such a holding has been achieved  half of the net amount after tax is expected to be invested in Munters shares.To which extent the criteria for awarding variable cash salary have been satisfied shall be evaluated when the measurement period has ended. The board of directors is responsible for the evaluation so far as it concerns variable cash salary to the CEO. The remuneration committee is responsible for the evaluation so far as it concerns variable cash salary to other members of the group management. For financial objectives  the evaluation shall be based on the latest financial information made public by the company.Terms and conditions for both annual variable cash salary and long-term variable cash salary shall be designed so that the board of directors  if exceptional economic circumstances prevail  has the option of limiting or refraining from payment if such a measure is considered reasonable.Additional variable cash remuneration may be awarded in extraordinary circumstances  provided that such extraordinary arrangements are limited in time and only made on an individual basis  either for the purpose of recruiting or retaining executives  or as remuneration for extraordinary performance beyond the individual's ordinary tasks. Such remuneration may not exceed an amount corresponding to 50 per cent of the fixed annual cash salary and shall not be paid more than once per year and per individual. Resolution on such remuneration shall be made by the board of directors based on a proposal from the remuneration committee.PensionFor the CEO  pension benefits  including health insurance  shall be defined contribution. Variable cash salary shall not qualify for pension benefits. Pension contributions for defined contribution pension shall amount to not more than 35 per cent of the fixed annual cash salary.For other members of the group management  pension benefits  including health insurance  shall be defined contribution unless the executive concerned is subject to defined benefit pension under mandatory collective agreement provisions. Variable cash salary shall qualify for pension benefits to the extent required by mandatory collective agreement provisions applicable to the executive. Pension contributions for defined contribution pension shall amount to not more than 35 per cent of the fixed annual cash salary.Other benefits and compensationOther compensation may consist of other benefits that are customary and in line with market terms  such as medical insurance  life insurance and company cars  which shall not constitute a significant part of the total remuneration. Such benefits may amount to not more than 10 per cent of the fixed annual cash salary.For employments governed by rules other than Swedish  pension benefits and other benefits may be duly adjusted for compliance with mandatory rules or established local practice  taking into account  to the extent possible  the overall purpose of these guidelines.Consultancy fee to board membersIn specific cases  and for a limited time  Munters board members elected by the general meeting may be able to be remunerated for services within their respective areas of expertise  which do not constitute board work. For these services (including services performed by a board member's wholly-owned company)  a fee on market terms can be paid  provided that such services contribute to the implementation of Munters business strategy and safeguarding of Munters long-term interests  including its sustainability. Such consultancy fee may  for each board member  in no case exceed one year's board fee.Termination of employmentFixed cash salary during the notice period and severance pay  as well as remuneration for any non-compete restrictions  shall in total not exceed an amount corresponding to the fixed cash salary for two years for the CEO and 18 months for other members of the group management. Severance pay shall not be paid if notice of termination of employment is made by the CEO and other members of the group management. The notice period between the company and the CEO  and other members of the group management  shall not exceed 6 months.Remuneration for any non-compete restrictions shall compensate for any loss of income and shall only be paid for such period as the former executive does not have the right to severance pay. The remuneration shall amount to not more than 60 per cent of the fixed annual cash salary at the time of termination of employment  unless otherwise provided by mandatory collective agreement provisions  and shall be payable during the period subject to the non-compete restriction  which shall not exceed 12 months after termination of employment.Salary and employment conditions for employeesIn the preparation of the board of directors' proposal for these remuneration guidelines  salary and employment conditions for employees of the company and the group's Swedish operations have been taken into account by including information on the employees' total remuneration  the components of the remuneration and increase and growth rate over time  in the remuneration committee's and the board of directors' basis of decision when evaluating whether the guidelines and the limitations set out herein are reasonable.[1]Preparation and decision-making processThe board of directors has established a remuneration committee.

By blocking Notes in the relevant Clearing System  each Direct Participant will be deemed to consent to have the relevant Clearing System provide details concerning such Direct Participant's identity to the Settlement Agent (and for the Settlement Agent to provide such details to the Issuer and its legal advisers).It is a term of the 2023 Put Option that 2023 Put Option Election Notices are irrevocable and no withdrawals are permitted.Procedures for Notes held through Euroclear and Clearstream  LuxembourgTo participate Notes effectively in the 2023 Put Option  participants of Euroclear or Clearstream  Luxembourg  as the case may be  must electronically transmit their 2023 Put Option Election Notice via a message to Euroclear or Clearstream  Luxembourg  as the case may be  containing the following information:the event or reference number issued by Euroclear or Clearstream  Luxembourg; the name of the Direct Participant and the securities account number in which the Notes the Holder wishes to participate in the 2023 Put Option are held; the ISINs and Common Codes of such Notes; the principal amount of the Notes; and any other information as may be required by Euroclear or Clearstream  Luxembourg  and duly notified to the Holder prior to the submission of the 2023 Put Option Election Notice.In addition  each Holder must:cause Euroclear or Clearstream  Luxembourg  as the case may be  to block the position in such Notes in accordance with the procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream  Luxembourg  as the case may be; and instruct Euroclear or Clearstream  Luxembourg  as the case may be  to send the Settlement Agent an electronic message confirming: the Direct Participant's 2023 Put Option Election Notice; and that the position in such Notes has been blocked from trading pending settlement of the 2023 Put Option.Euroclear and Clearstream  Luxembourg will collect from the Direct Participants:instructions to: participate the Notes in the 2023 Put Option and deliver the acceptances held by them on behalf of their Direct Participants; and credit their accounts on the Settlement Date  in respect to all Notes in respect of which a 2023 Put Option Election Notice has been validly submitted; and irrevocable authorisation to disclose the name of the Direct Participants and information about the foregoing instructions to the Settlement Agent (and for the Settlement Agent to provide such details to the Issuer and its legal advisers).By participating in the 2023 Put Option in this manner  Holders will be deemed to have acknowledged that they have received this 2023 Put Event Notice and agree to be bound by the terms of this 2023 Put Event Notice and that the Issuer may enforce such agreement against such Holders.The 2023 Put Option Election Notices must be delivered to  and received by  Euroclear and Clearstream  Luxembourg in accordance with the relevant procedures and on or prior to the relevant deadline established by them.

Accordingly  a DTC participant whose name appears on the security position listing as the Holder of the Notes must electronically transmit its acceptance of the 2023 Put Option by causing DTC to transfer Notes in the participant’s account to the Settlement Agent’s account at DTC in accordance with DTC’s ATOP procedures. DTC will then send an agent’s message (as hereinafter defined) to the Settlement Agent in respect of the Notes.An “agent’s message” is a message  transmitted by DTC  received by the Settlement Agent and forming part of the book-entry confirmation  which states that DTC has received an express acknowledgement from the participant that such participant has received this 2023 Put Option Event Notice and agrees to be bound by the terms of the 2023 Put Option  and that the Issuer may enforce the terms of the 2023 Put Option against such participant.Although transfer of the Notes to the Settlement Agent’s account at DTC may be effected through book-entry at DTC  an agent’s message must be transmitted by DTC and received by the Settlement Agent on or prior to the Expiration Deadline in order to validly tender Notes pursuant to the 2023 Put Option.

All 2023 Put Option Election Notices submitted through DTC’s ATOP system must be submitted in accordance with the deadlines and procedures established by DTC and an agent’s message with respect to participation in the 2023 Put Option must be received by the Settlement Agent on or prior to the Expiration Deadline.There are no letters of transmittal or guaranteed delivery procedures for the 2023 Put Option. Holders who hold Notes through DTC must participate their Notes in the 2023 Put Option through DTC’s ATOP procedures.Tax consequencesIn view of the number of different jurisdictions where tax laws may apply to a Holder  this notice does not discuss the tax consequences for Holders arising from the purchase of Notes by the Issuer pursuant to the 2023 Put Option. Holders are urged to consult their own professional advisers regarding these possible tax consequences under the laws of the jurisdictions that apply to them or to the sale of their Notes and the receipt pursuant to the 2023 Put Option of the Repurchase Price.

Holders are responsible for informing themselves of such deadlines and for arranging the due and timely delivery of 2023 Put Option Election Notice to Euroclear or Clearstream  Luxembourg.Holders should note that Euroclear and Clearstream  Luxembourg are not direct participants in DTC in respect of the Rule 144A Notes and 2023 Put Option Election Notices delivered to Euroclear and/or Clearstream  Luxembourg in respect of such Notes shall in turn be the subject of corresponding 2023 Put Option Election Notices from Euroclear and/or Clearstream  Luxembourg to DTC via their Direct Participants. Holders should ensure that they submit a 2023 Put Option Election Notice by such deadline as Euroclear and/or Clearstream  Luxembourg require to allow Euroclear and/or Clearstream  Luxembourg to provide corresponding 2023 Put Option Election Notices via their Direct Participants to DTC.Procedures for Notes held through DTCAny Holder who holds Notes through DTC must arrange for a Direct Participant in DTC to electronically transmit the Holder’s 2023 Put Option Election Notice through DTC’s Automated Tender Offer Program (ATOP)  for which the 2023 Put Option will be eligible. Accordingly  a DTC participant whose name appears on the security position listing as the Holder of the Notes must electronically transmit its acceptance of the 2023 Put Option by causing DTC to transfer Notes in the participant’s account to the Settlement Agent’s account at DTC in accordance with DTC’s ATOP procedures. DTC will then send an agent’s message (as hereinafter defined) to the Settlement Agent in respect of the Notes.An “agent’s message” is a message  transmitted by DTC  received by the Settlement Agent and forming part of the book-entry confirmation  which states that DTC has received an express acknowledgement from the participant that such participant has received this 2023 Put Option Event Notice and agrees to be bound by the terms of the 2023 Put Option  and that the Issuer may enforce the terms of the 2023 Put Option against such participant.Although transfer of the Notes to the Settlement Agent’s account at DTC may be effected through book-entry at DTC  an agent’s message must be transmitted by DTC and received by the Settlement Agent on or prior to the Expiration Deadline in order to validly tender Notes pursuant to the 2023 Put Option. Notes tendered through DTC’s ATOP system will be held to the order of the Settlement Agent until the Settlement Date.Holders who intend to participate their Notes in the 2023 Put Option on the date of the Expiration Deadline should allow sufficient time for completion of the ATOP procedures during the normal business hours of DTC on such date. All 2023 Put Option Election Notices submitted through DTC’s ATOP system must be submitted in accordance with the deadlines and procedures established by DTC and an agent’s message with respect to participation in the 2023 Put Option must be received by the Settlement Agent on or prior to the Expiration Deadline.There are no letters of transmittal or guaranteed delivery procedures for the 2023 Put Option. Holders who hold Notes through DTC must participate their Notes in the 2023 Put Option through DTC’s ATOP procedures.Tax consequencesIn view of the number of different jurisdictions where tax laws may apply to a Holder  this notice does not discuss the tax consequences for Holders arising from the purchase of Notes by the Issuer pursuant to the 2023 Put Option. Holders are urged to consult their own professional advisers regarding these possible tax consequences under the laws of the jurisdictions that apply to them or to the sale of their Notes and the receipt pursuant to the 2023 Put Option of the Repurchase Price. Holders are liable for their own taxes and have no recourse to the Issuer or the Settlement Agent with respect to taxes arising in connection with the 2023 Put Option.Compliance with applicable Sanctions laws and regulationsBy submitting a 2023 Put Option Election Notice in the manner specified above  the Holder represents and warrants to the Issuer and the Settlement Agent on the date of submission of the 2023 Put Option Election Notice and on each date until the Settlement Date that:(i) it (and any person acting for  on behalf of  or at the direction of or through it)  the person(s) having a substantial influence over it (and any person acting for  on behalf of  or at the direction of or through it) up to the ultimate beneficial owners  and each of their officers or directors (A) is not  and is not acting for or on behalf of  or at the direction of or through  a Sanctions Disqualified Person; and (B) has complied with all Sanctions in connection with the 2023 Put Option; (ii) it (and any person acting for  on behalf of  or at the direction of or through it) has submitted the 2023 Put Option Election Notice in compliance with Sanctions; and (iii) it (and any person acting for  on behalf of  or at the direction of or through it) has not taken or omitted to take any action in breach of Sanctions or which will or could result in the Issuer acting in breach of Sanctions in connection with the 2023 Put Option and the 2023 Put Option Election Notice; andit shall notify the Issuer (via the Settlement Agent) if at any time during the intervening period between the date of submission of its 2023 Put Option Election Notice and the Settlement Date if it would not be able to repeat the representations and warranties in paragraph (a) above.Holders who are not Sanctions Disqualified Persons  and are not acting for  on behalf of  or at the direction of or through Sanctions Disqualified Persons may submit a 2023 Put Option Election Notice and participate in the 2023 Put Option in respect of their relevant Series of Notes. Holders who are  or are acting for  on behalf of  at the direction of or through  Sanctions Disqualified Persons are not permitted to submit a 2023 Put Option Election Notice or participate in the 2023 Put Option.Repurchase of the NotesOn the Settlement Date  the Issuer will  but only in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations  including Sanctions  purchase such Notes of Holders who have validly submitted a 2023 Put Option Election Notice. Such tendered Notes will be cancelled upon payment to the Holder of the Repurchase Price to the account specified by such Holder in their validly submitted 2023 Put Option Election Notice  provided that such account must not be held at or through a bank or custody account which is a Sanctioned Disqualified Person and must otherwise be in compliance with Sanctions.For the avoidance of doubt  the Issuer’s obligations to purchase Notes under the 2023 Put Option shall only arise with respect to Notes which are not held by Holders that are Sanctions Disqualified Persons and are not held through a Sanctions Disqualified Person  and only if such purchase is otherwise in compliance with Sanctions.2023 Noteholders may contact the Settlement Agent via email at veon@is.kroll.com if they require assistance with any of the above.Kroll Issuer Services Limited as the Settlement AgentTelephone: + 44 20 7704 0880Email: veon@is.kroll.comAttention: Paul KammingaImportant NoticeThis notice is for informational purposes only and shall not constitute a prospectus or an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy securities in the United States or any other jurisdiction  nor shall there be any offer of securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer  solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under applicable securities laws.This notice is not a prospectus for the purposes of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129.This notice or information contained herein is not an offer  or an invitation to make offers  to sell  exchange or otherwise transfer securities in the Russian Federation and does not constitute an advertisement or offering of securities in the Russian Federation within the meaning of Russian securities laws.

Fitusiran has the potential to provide prophylaxis for all types of hemophilia  regardless of inhibitor status  with as few as six subcutaneous injections per year.Dietmar Berger  M.D.  Ph.D.Head of Global R&D ad interim and Chief Medical Officer at Sanofi“Sanofi is committed to advancing the standard of care for all people with hemophilia through innovative science  providing consistent bleed protection while reducing treatment burden. We are entering a new era in hemophilia where  for the first time  people can choose therapies that meet their personal needs. These published data validate our science and add to a growing body of evidence supporting fitusiran’s potential to transform the treatment landscape. We look forward to sharing additional data on fitusiran later this year.”Both Phase 3 studies compared once-monthly subcutaneous fitusiran prophylaxis (80mg) with on-demand/episodic use of clotting factor concentrates in the ATLAS-A/B study  and on-demand/episodic use of bypassing agents in the ATLAS-INH study. Across both clinical studies  prophylactic treatment with fitusiran reduced annualized bleeding rates by 90% (95% CI [84.1%; 93.6%]  P <0.0001) compared to the control arms  showing a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in bleeding episodes when compared to on-demand treatments; and showed improvement in quality of life.Story continuesIn the study ATLAS-INH study published by The Lancet  66% of participants with inhibitors (25 out of 38) receiving fitusiran 80mg monthly experienced zero bleeding episodes compared to 5% (1 out of 19) receiving an on-demand bypassing agent after nine months of treatment.The ATLAS A/B study published in The Lancet Haematology showed 51% of participants without inhibitors (40 out of 79) who received fitusiran 80mg monthly prophylaxis experienced zero bleeds compared to 5% (2 out of 40) in the comparator group  receiving on-demand clotting factor concentrates.Sanofi is currently investigating the efficacy and safety of fitusiran under a revised regimen which includes lower doses and less frequent dosing (as few as six subcutaneous injections per year)  maintaining an antithrombin target range of 15-35% in all ongoing studies.ATLAS-AB Phase 3 StudyATLAS-A/B is a Phase 3 randomized  open-label study investigating the efficacy and safety of fitusiran in males ≥12 years with severe hemophilia A or B without inhibitors who had previously been treated with on-demand clotting factor concentrates. Study participants (n=120) were randomized 2:1 to receive either once-monthly 80mg subcutaneous fitusiran prophylaxis or on-demand clotting factor concentrates. The primary endpoint is annualized bleeding rate.ATLAS-INH Phase 3 StudyThe ATLAS-INH study is a randomized  open-label Phase 3 study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of fitusiran in males ≥12 years with severe hemophilia A or B with inhibitors to factor VIII or IX. Study participants (n=57) receiving on-demand treatment with bypassing agents (BPA) were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive once-monthly 80mg subcutaneous fitusiran prophylaxis or continue with on-demand BPA. The primary endpoint is annualized bleeding rate.About fitusiranFitusiran is an investigational  subcutaneously administered small interference RNA therapeutic in development for the prophylactic treatment of people with hemophilia A or B  with or without inhibitors. Fitusiran is designed to lower antithrombin  a protein that inhibits blood clotting  with the goal of promoting thrombin generation to rebalance hemostasis and prevent bleeds. Fitusiran utilizes Alnylam Pharmaceutical Inc.’s ESC-GalNAc conjugate technology  which enables subcutaneous dosing with increased potency and durability. Fitusiran is currently under clinical investigation and has not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives.

Sales turnover in 2022 increased by more than 30% compared to 2021  surpassing pre-COVID levels  with 50% of its revenue coming from products manufactured in-house.Quadpack is consolidating all plastic injection at its Kierspe site (Germany) for increased efficiency and a more streamlined service to customers. Recognised for its expertise in PET injection  the site manufactures the company's own range of plastic packaging solutions  including jars and airless systems. Further investments have been made to increase capacity and integrate decoration into the production process. The consolidation involves the closure of the operations of Quadpack Plastics in Castellbisbal  Spain  and the transfer of injection assets to the Kierspe plant.2023 will see Quadpack's manufacturing operations expand into the Americas through strategic partnerships  bringing production closer to its customers in the region for improved time to market and a lower carbon footprint. Further sales growth is expected for the year  with continued high demand for own manufacture.

Overall  Sidetrade delivered a record year of bookings  posting nearly €6.5 million in new Annual Recurring Revenue up +36% overall with 51% from the United States. This performance provides excellent visibility for our revenue in 2023. Significantly  Sidetrade now achieves more than half of its revenue internationally  with 24% already generated in North America.In addition to our remarkable commercial successes  with a gross margin close to 80%  our efficient SaaS model enabled us to invest €7 million in North America for the full year while retaining an operating margin at 10% of our revenue. Sidetrade is one of those rare companies in the software industry that can invest heavily in North American expansion  with rapid and significant commercial success in return  while maintaining double-digit profitability.Sidetrade has effectively expanded its scale and we are proud to be recognized as one of the three global leaders in the Order-to-Cash segment. Despite a background of economic uncertainty  we enter 2023 with confidence and enthusiasm  strengthened by the bookings recorded in 2022. The market outlook is buoyant against a backdrop where many companies are under pressure to secure and improve their cash flow. Once more  our robust model – which maintains a healthy balance between growth and profitability – has served to develop our strongest ever market position.”Story continuesIncreased robustness thanks to a profitable growth modelSidetrade(€m) 2022 2021 Change New SaaS Subscriptions(New ARR) 6.44 4.75 36% of which North America 3.27 1.04 214% Revenue 36.8 32.6 +13% ‘Order-to-Cash’ Activities 35.9 30.3 +18% ‘Sales & Marketing’ Activities 0.9 2.3 -61% Gross margin 29.0 25.7 +13% as a % of Revenue 79% 79% Operating expenses (OPEX) (25.3) (20.7) +22% of which North America (7.0) (3.5) +100% Operating profit 3.7 5.0 -26% as a % of Revenue 10% 15% Net profit 3.4 4.7 -28%2022 accounts have been audited and will be certified after finalization of procedures required for the annual financial report.Record bookings in 2022  with more than €10 million in Annual Contract Value and €6.44 million in ARR  up +36%In 2022  Sidetrade achieved a +36% increase in Annual Recurring Revenue (“ARR”) which totaled €6.44 million. This performance reflects the strong demand for the Company's solutions  winning a growing number of new customers. In an ever-changing economic environment  the management of operating working capital  and particularly accounts receivable  is a major challenge for companies  irrespective of their sector.In 2022  bookings linked to services (implementation  configuration and training  excluding recurring services) also achieved robust growth of +37%  amounting to €3.84 million. Considering that almost all of these services will be invoiced over the next twelve months (excluding recurring services which can be invoiced over several years)  Sidetrade adds the equivalent of €10.28 million in Annual Contract Value (“ACV”)  representing a +36% increase.United States – a robust growth driver with 51% of bookings in 2022Sidetrade continued to increase international orders  which represented 66% of all bookings in 2022. The commercial success in the United States was especially significant on a half-yearly basis  since the US already represented more than half the total bookings (51%) on a full-year basis in 2022.The contracts won in preference over American competitors demonstrate  on the one hand  Sidetrade’s technological edge – recognized as one of the three global leaders in Gartner’s 2022 Magic Quadrant™ for Integrated Invoice-to-Cash applications – and on the other  the delivery capacity and execution of the salesforce  which will continue its ramp-up in the quarters ahead.In 2022  Sidetrade reported a dramatic increase of +60% in the total value of these new subscription contracts (“Total Contract Value” or “TCV”) over their initial contract periods (excluding renewals and services) which reached €20.7 million. In particular  this surge is attributed to an extension of the initial contract period for new customers (excluding renewals) to 44.9 months  thereby increasing the economic model’s high predictability.Overall  in FY 2022  bookings by new customers and cross-selling represented 80% of total bookings  with the remaining 20% of bookings accounting for upselling of additional modules to existing customers compared to 28% in FY 2021.Lastly  churn rate for enterprise accounts remains under control at 3.83% as of December 31  2022  significantly below the SaaS industry’s average of 14% according to the “2022 Private SaaS Company Survey Results “ by KeyBanc Capital Markets.Strong increase in ‘Order-to-Cash’ revenue to +18%  driven by 'Order-to-Cash' SaaS subscriptions  up 22%‘Order-to-Cash’ activities  which form a core business within the Company’s strategy  represented 98% of total revenue at end-2022. In FY 2022  these activities increased by +18%  mainly due to strong growth in SaaS subscriptions (+22%). This increase is the result of record bookings in the 2021 fiscal year and early fiscal 2022  which continued to have an impact throughout the 2022 fiscal year.As announced  the ‘Sales & Marketing’ activities accounted for only 2% of total revenue at end-2022  and will continue to decline  with estimated revenue of €0.5 million at end-2023. In 2022  the negative impact on total revenue growth was 5% (18% for ‘Order-to-Cash’ activities vs. 13% growth in total) and will automatically have considerably less impact in 2023.Sidetrade’s revenue is also underpinned by vigorous growth in international markets which  for the first time  represents more than half its revenue (54% of total revenue)  including 24% for North America.Total revenue grew by +13% in FY 2022  to €36.8 million.With a backdrop of economic uncertainty  Sidetrade’s economic model provides its business with significant resilience  as 90% of its revenue is recurring. It should be noted that all Sidetrade subscription contracts  including new contracts  contain an annual automatic price re-indexation clause based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the relevant country.With its sound fundamentals and a highly favorable growth outlook  Sidetrade has excellent pricing power that protects the Company’s future revenue against inflationary pressures.In respect to fiscal 2022  the impact of exchange rates on the Company was not material.Strong results in a context of accelerating investmentOutstanding gross margin at 79% of revenue  above the SaaS industry averageGross margin remained at a very high level  topping out at 79% of revenue for 2022  with a rate of 92% on SaaS subscriptions alone. This performance was driven both by a commercial strategy to promote Sidetrade’s technological edge and costs which were kept under control in an inflationary environment.Sidetrade continues to illustrate the robustness of its SaaS model  which generates significant incremental gross margin  year after year.Double-digit profitability at 10%  despite investment of €7 million in North AmericaOperating profit for 2022 totaled €3.7 million  representing 10% of revenue. The Group retained its profitability in double digits under the combined impact of revenue growth  an excellent gross margin and efficient cost control.Bolstered by its robust economic model  Sidetrade has undertaken an unprecedented effort to accelerate investment in North America  which amounted to €7 million in 2022  focused on building a team of 52 colleagues in the region to end of 2022.Operating profit for 2022 includes a French Research Tax Credit and subsidies of €2.7 million (vs. €2.2 million in 2021) as well as activation of €0.3 million in marginal R&D costs  i.e. 4% of R&D costs for the full year.Corporate income tax for 2022 totaled €0.4 million  versus €0.3 million in 2021.All told  Sidetrade’s net profit for 2022 was €3.4 million  demonstrating that growth and profitability are achievable while investing.Solid financial positionSidetrade reported €20.3 million in gross cash at year-end (vs. €18 million in 2021). As of December 31  2022  Sidetrade also holds 85 000 of its own shares with a value of €12.8 million.Sidetrade’s financial debt stands at €12 million (fixed rate at 1.1%)  giving the Group significant investment capacity to accelerate its expansion.Responsible growth for Sidetrade with a full assessment of its environmental impactIn addition to its robust financial results  Sidetrade is committed to a CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) approach. The latter centers on integrating ESG (Environmental  Social  Governance) challenges into its company strategy.While Sidetrade is not yet bound by regulatory requirements  as an industry-recognized leader  the Company understands the significant role it has in shaping a more responsible and sustainable future. With this in mind  Sidetrade has already performed a comprehensive Carbon Assessment (scopes 1  2 and 3) for FY 2022  which applies to activities and regions across the board. This assessment helped the Group to pinpoint the main greenhouse gas emission sources and identify concrete actions to regulate them.Humble in its approach  Sidetrade is committed to a purposeful and proactive CSR strategy  backed by its participation in the United Nations Global Compact (see press release of 15 February 2023 ) and in compliance with the European Union’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). Through this commitment  the Company is convinced that it will cement its industry-leading position.Strengthened by these results  Sidetrade looks ahead to fiscal 2023 with confidence and a clear vision and has the resources to fulfill its ambitions.Next financial announcementFirst Quarter Revenue for 2023: May 10  2023  after the stock market closes.Investor & Media relationsChristelle Dhrif +33 6 10 46 72 00 cdhrif@sidetrade.comAbout Sidetrade ( www.sidetrade.com )Sidetrade (Euronext Growth: ALBFR.PA) provides a SaaS platform dedicated to securing and accelerating cash flow.

The Company plans to use the proceeds of Tranche A towards the development of its pipeline of allogeneic CAR T-cell product candidates: UCART22  UCART20x22  UCART123 and UCARTCS1.The disbursement of Tranche A is subject to  among other conditions  (i) the issuance of a specified number of warrants to the benefit of EIB (the “Tranche A Warrants”) and (ii) the completion of certain clinical development milestone by a Cellectis’ licensee  and  as of the date of this press release  each of (i) and (ii) has been satisfied. In particular  on March 28  2023  the Company issued 2 799 188 Tranche A Warrants to EIB  in accordance with the terms of the 11th resolution of the shareholders’ meeting held on June 28  2022 and articles L. 228-91 and seq. of the French Commercial Code  representing 5.0% of the Company’s outstanding share capital as at their issuance date. The exercise price of the Tranche A Warrants is equal to €1.92  corresponding to 99% of the volume-weighted average price of the Company’s ordinary shares over the last 3 trading days preceding the decision of the board of directors of the Company to issue the Tranche A Warrants.Tranche A will mature six years from its disbursement date. Interest on Tranche A shall be paid in kind  shall be capitalized annually by increasing the principal amount of Tranche A  and shall accrue at a rate equal to 8% per annum.Prepayment events under the Finance Contract: Tranche A may  in certain circumstances  be prepaid  in whole or in part  for a prepayment fee  either at the election of the Company or as a result of EIB’s demand following certain prepayment events  including a change of control or change in senior management of the Company.Subject to certain terms and conditions  upon the occurrence of customary events of default (e.g.  payment default  misrepresentations in representations included in the Finance Contract  and cross defaults  among others)  EIB may demand immediate repayment by the Company of all or part of the outstanding amount and/or cancel the undisbursed tranches.Terms and Conditions of the EIB Warrants: As described above  in connection with the Finance Contract  the Company agreed to issue warrants to EIB as a condition to the funding of each tranche under the Finance Contract.The number of warrants to be issued to EIB under the Finance Contract (the “EIB Warrants”) is or will be determined as follows: (i) with respect to Tranche A  2 799 188 Tranche A Warrants representing 5.0% of the Company’s outstanding share capital as indicated above; (ii) with respect to a second tranche of €15 million (“Tranche B”)  (a) if the sum of cash injections through the issuance of new ordinary shares or other securities subordinated to the Finance Contract and upfront and milestone payments in connection with existing or new partnerships between October 31  2022 and the Tranche B disbursement exceeds €42 500 000  an aggregate number of warrants equal to 15 000 000 divided by the product of the average price of the Company’s ordinary shares over the five trading days before the issuance date (the “5-Day AP”) multiplied by 4.0 and (b) otherwise  an aggregate number of warrants equal to 15 000 000 divided by the product of the 5-Day AP multiplied by 3.75; and (iii) with respect to a third tranche of €5 million (“Tranche C”)  (a) if the sum of cash injections through the issuance of new ordinary shares or other securities subordinated to the Finance Contract and upfront and milestone payments in connection with existing or new partnerships between October 31  2022 and the Tranche C disbursement exceeds €70 000 000  an aggregate number of warrants equal to 5 000 000 divided by product of the 5-Day AP multiplied by 4.75; and (b) otherwise  an aggregate number of warrants equal to 5 000 000 divided by the product of the 5-Day AP multiplied by 4.25.Each EIB Warrant will entitle EIB to one ordinary share of the Company in exchange for the exercise price (subject to applicable adjustments and anti-dilution provisions). The EIB Warrants will have an exercise price per share equal to 99% of the weighted average price per share of the Company over the last three trading days prior to their issuance. The EIB Warrants with respect to Tranche B and Tranche C are only issuable if the Company elects to drawdown such tranches.The EIB Warrants expire on the twentieth anniversary of their issuance date  at which time such unexercised EIB Warrants will be automatically deemed null and void.

(the ""Company"" - Euronext - FR0010557264 - AB) today provides an update on the schedule for the evaluation by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and by Health Canada of its applications for conditional approval of masitinib in the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).As part of the ongoing EMA procedure  AB Science has submitted its responses to the Day 120 assessment of the procedure.Because EMA and Health Canada regulatory procedures were concurrent and in order to ensure the best quality of responses in both procedures  AB Science  in agreement with Health Canada  has extended the response period to Health Canada by 30 days. The new deadline to respond to Health Canada is April 12  2023.AB Science has received support from several ALS patient groups in Canada and Europe for the conditional registration of masitinib in ALS.Olivier Goy  co-founder and president of October  a European FinTech  said: ""Masitinib is one of the most promising drugs in ALS that has just been submitted to the EMA conditional approval process. I strongly support drugs that are submitted for conditional approval  especially when they have complementary mechanisms of action.""Sabine Turgeman  Executive Director of the ARSLA (Association pour la recherche sur la SLA) said: ""The European regulation has provided since 2004 a legislative framework  in Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004  to support the conditional registration of drugs in incurable diseases when definitive evidence of efficacy is not yet fully met. Conditional registration is the right procedure to accelerate access of new treatments to patients. We urge the EMA to apply maximum regulatory flexibility in the context of ALS  an incurable and fatal degenerative disease.""Bre Hamilton  Executive Director of ALS Action Canada said: ""Marketing authorization under NOC/c status will allow Health Canada to provide earlier market access for Canadian living with ALS to products that have demonstrated promising clinical efficacy in clinical trials for the treatment  prevention or diagnosis of serious  life-threatening or severely debilitating diseases. Canadian families living with the devastating disease of ALS and in urgent need of new drug therapies want masitinib to benefit from this conditional registration.""About AB ScienceFounded in 2001  AB Science is a pharmaceutical company specializing in the research  development and commercialization of protein kinase inhibitors (PKIs)  a class of targeted proteins whose action are key in signaling pathways within cells.

This SaaS version is included in the WALLIX PAM4OT package.To carry out their activities  organizations - in all sectors and especially in industry - rely on external service providers who  in order to fulfill their mission  need to connect to their IT infrastructure (traditional or industrial).SaaS Remote Access is aimed at all organizations wishing to provide digital access to their IT infrastructure to external service providers  thanks to simplified management while benefiting from the highest level of cybersecurity offered by a PAM leader recognized by Gartner.Paris  April 4th  2023 – WALLIX  (Euronext ALLIX) a European cybersecurity software publisher expert in Access and Identity Solutions  launches SaaS Remote Access  the SaaS version of the remote access management technology integrated into WALLIX PAM4ALL  its unified privilege management solution. SaaS Remote Access is designed for organizations - across all sectors and in particular the industrial one - that want to provide digital access to their IT infrastructure to external providers through simplified management  while benefiting from the highest level of cybersecurity offered by a PAM leader recognized by Gartner.To carry out their business  organizations rely on external service providers who need to connect to their IT infrastructure (whether traditional or industrial). These can be remote maintainers  supply chain vendors  service providers  external consultants  etc.The problem for organizations is that these external stakeholders are numerous and can change constantly. In addition  the frequency and duration of their intervention vary according to the needs of the business and their requirements. This is why visualizing  managing  and securing their access becomes a real headache for IT teams. It is indeed vital for organizations to know who has access to what  from where  and why  as well as to manage access permissions. This is the only way to detect and stop any attempt at identity theft by a hacker  internal malice  or negligence  and thus protect data. The fact is that the cost of a cyberattack increases by an average of $370 000 if a third party is involved. Moreover  by implementing traceability through a security and digital access management solution  organizations also ensure regulatory compliance with current cybersecurity standards.Traditionally  in an attempt to manage external stakeholder access  the IT team will implement VPN technology  a secure ""tunnel"" between the external stakeholder's device and the organization's IT infrastructure. Except that  in reality  VPN vulnerabilities regularly make news headlines. On the other hand  implementing VPNs is a cumbersome and expensive process: each stakeholder must be referenced in Active Directory  the Microsoft software used by almost all organizations  which allows permissions to be managed and access to IT resources (data  servers  applications  software  etc.) to be controlled. And this technology does not meet the regulatory requirements either.The Answer: SaaS Remote AccessTo optimize the management of external service provider access  IT teams should turn to innovative solutions such as SaaS Remote Access.WALLIX PAM4ALL is a unified privilege management solution. It combines all WALLIX technologies: multi-factor authentication (MFA)  remote access management  session management  password management  and least privilege management. The solution secures all access to the IT infrastructure  ensuring data protection  detection  and resistance to cyberattacks and business continuity. It also ensures compliance with cybersecurity regulations.SaaS Remote Access is WALLIX PAM4ALL's ""remote access management"" technology now available as a service. It has been developed especially for the access management of external providers.This SaaS version of the WALLIX remote access management technology is also available in WALLIX PAM4OT  a packaged offer based on WALLIX PAM4ALL  dedicated to industrial companies and those that own industrial equipment (like hospitals with scanners  etc.).The advantages of subscribing to this functionality in SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) mode are:Ease of Deployment and UseThanks to SaaS mode  there is no need to install a new solution to replace VPNs; an Internet connection is all that is needed to access SaaS Remote Access. This allows better accessibility  flexibility  and cost reduction. In addition  thanks to its user-friendly interface  it is quick and easy for companies to register their external service providers and configure their access rights to authorized resources. This frees the IT team from these actions and allows them to focus on more value-added tasks.End-to-end SecurityThe digital identities and passwords of external stakeholders are no longer integrated into the organization's Active Directory but are managed and secured in SaaS Remote Access. This drastically reduces cyber risk  since the more digital identities in the Active Directory  the greater the chance of a hacker stealing them and then accessing all the resources of the person whose identity has been stolen. This also allows the organization to have an IT hygiene that follows cybersecurity and traceability standards  enabling cybersecurity by design.Full Visibility of External Remote AccessWith SaaS Remote Access  organizations regain control of external remote access. Companies create access for their external providers in real time for a defined period and are automatically removed once the task is completed. External providers connect to the organization's IT infrastructure through the SaaS Remote Access web portal and every action they take is monitored  providing full visibility and transparency.""With this remote access management for suppliers  we are both meeting the security challenges of IT teams and promoting the digital transformation of companies. We also give autonomy to business teams and put the digital experience at the heart of our solution: speed of access creation  fluidity of interactions with suppliers  and operational efficiency for all business and IT teams. Interacting with suppliers and maintaining a line of defense for digital access becomes extremely easy and cost-effective with our solution. The launch of this service for securing external access to IT and industrial infrastructures is only the first phase of WALLIX's SaaS strategy "" explains Edwige Brossard  Product & Marketing Director at WALLIX.ABOUT WALLIXWALLIX is the European specialist in access and digital identity security and the world leader in PAM (Privileged Access Management).

In 2020  it was estimated that there were over 2.2 million new cases of breast cancer worldwide1. Invasive breast cancer is classified into distinct categories with differing tumour behaviour and prognosis2. Based on the expression of hormone receptors that are present in breast cancer cells (HER2  ER  PR)3 and a proliferation marker (Ki67)4  the main molecular subtypes of invasive breast cancer can be distinguished.5 The presence or absence of these markers can guide the selection of appropriate treatment options. ER and PR are important indicators of how well a breast cancer tumour will respond to hormone therapy. HER2  on the other hand  is an important predictor of response to targeted therapy  such as trastuzumab6. The detection of these markers is routinely performed with IHC7.APIS’ current Breast Cancer Subtyping Kit is an RNA-based diagnostic assay for detecting mRNA expression of standard biomarkers (HER2  ER  PR  Ki67) and novel proliferative biomarkers from pre-operative core-needle biopsy (CNB) or resected formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) breast tumour tissue. The test aims to address a number of unmet needs in current practice  including improving reproducibility and accuracy in the Ki67 proliferation measurement and assessment of low HER2 expression status. The latter is especially important as recent studies have shown HER2-low patients to be responsive to a new category of HER2 targeting therapies.8 9Currently  the APIS Breast Cancer Subtyping Kit is available as a manual kit for in vitro diagnostic use10  mainly addressing centralized expert laboratories. The kit is currently offered by APIS in the UK and will be broadly commercialised11 by Biocartis ahead of the Idylla™ version of the assay becoming available. While the manual kit already offers a reduced time for results interpretation (as compared to current IHC based workflows)  the Idylla™ version of the Breast Cancer Subtyping assay will further benefit from the workflow and decentralization advantages of the Idylla™ platform. This is expected to allow for the fastest time to results and for improved access to the most accurate biomarker results for patients worldwide.Herman Verrelst  Chief Executive Officer of Biocartis  commented: “We are excited about partnering with APIS Assay Technologies to improve molecular classification for breast cancer patients.

In 2020  it was estimated that there were over 2.2 million new cases of breast cancer worldwide1. Invasive breast cancer is classified into distinct categories with differing tumour behaviour and prognosis2. Based on the expression of hormone receptors that are present in breast cancer cells (HER2  ER  PR)3 and a proliferation marker (Ki67)4  the main molecular subtypes of invasive breast cancer can be distinguished.5 The presence or absence of these markers can guide the selection of appropriate treatment options. ER and PR are important indicators of how well a breast cancer tumour will respond to hormone therapy. HER2  on the other hand  is an important predictor of response to targeted therapy  such as trastuzumab6. The detection of these markers is routinely performed with IHC7.APIS’ current Breast Cancer Subtyping Kit is an RNA-based diagnostic assay for detecting mRNA expression of standard biomarkers (HER2  ER  PR  Ki67) and novel proliferative biomarkers from pre-operative core-needle biopsy (CNB) or resected formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) breast tumour tissue. The test aims to address a number of unmet needs in current practice  including improving reproducibility and accuracy in the Ki67 proliferation measurement and assessment of low HER2 expression status. The latter is especially important as recent studies have shown HER2-low patients to be responsive to a new category of HER2 targeting therapies.8 9Currently  the APIS Breast Cancer Subtyping Kit is available as a manual kit for in vitro diagnostic use10  mainly addressing centralized expert laboratories. The kit is currently offered by APIS in the UK and will be broadly commercialised11 by Biocartis ahead of the Idylla™ version of the assay becoming available. While the manual kit already offers a reduced time for results interpretation (as compared to current IHC based workflows)  the Idylla™ version of the Breast Cancer Subtyping assay will further benefit from the workflow and decentralization advantages of the Idylla™ platform. This is expected to allow for the fastest time to results and for improved access to the most accurate biomarker results for patients worldwide.Herman Verrelst  Chief Executive Officer of Biocartis  commented: “We are excited about partnering with APIS Assay Technologies to improve molecular classification for breast cancer patients.

April 4  2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Sanofi and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority   part of the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response within the U.S. Department of Health and Human S…,"BRIDGEWATER  N.J.  April 4  2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Sanofi and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA)  part of the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR) within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)  celebrated today the groundbreaking of a new  state-of-the-art formulation and filling facility at Sanofi's Swiftwater site in Pennsylvania.The new formulation and filling facility will be a two-story building complete with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) formulation  filling  and support areas. The filler will be capable of filling syringe and vials using isolator barrier technology and single use technology for flexibility. This manufacturing facility represents one of three significant manufacturing investments made at the site  supported by federal funds  as part of a contract awarded earlier on December 5  2019 by BARDA to increase domestic production capabilities for recombinant pandemic influenza vaccines.Rakesh KakkarUS Head of Vaccine Manufacturing and Supply  Sanofi""This groundbreaking event marks another significant step in our longstanding relationship with BARDA. Past pandemics confirmed that public-private partnerships are key to providing a relevant and quick answer to pandemic situations. Our Swiftwater site  and Sanofi teams globally  have the highest level of expertise in helping to protect people against flu and its complications. We are committed to maintaining continuous efforts to prepare for the next flu pandemic.""The Sanofi-BARDA contract supports the clinical development of an adjuvanted recombinant pandemic influenza vaccine that utilizes the same technology as Sanofi's recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine. The contract also expands the Swiftwater site's capacity to be a center of excellence for pandemic preparedness by enhancing vaccine manufacturing  adding both recombinant and adjuvant technologies to the current egg-based platform capabilities.This project has been supported in whole or in part with federal funds from the Department of Health and Human Services; Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response; Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA)  under contract number 75A50120D00002.About Pandemic PreparednessAs the world's largest manufacturer of seasonal flu vaccines  Sanofi has established capability and can play its part to bring any new pandemic infection under control. Sanofi has extensive expertise and experience in flu prevention  providing over 250 million doses of flu vaccines every year to more than 120 countries. Sanofi also developed and registered vaccines to address the 2009 A/HIN1 pandemic in a matter of weeks.Egg-based vaccine supply would well contribute to support a global influenza pandemic response should it arise either from A/H5N1 or any other influenza strain. The objective of Sanofi's contract with BARDA is to expand pandemic influenza preparedness and leverage another – recombinant  protein-based – technology to deliver a pandemic vaccine.About Recombinant TechnologyProduction of recombinant flu vaccines does not require an egg or cell-grown vaccine virus or the candidate vaccine virus. Instead  recombinant vaccines are created synthetically by using the virus's genetic instructions  ensuring exact match of the vaccine with the circulating virus strain.About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people's lives. Our team  across some 100 countries  is dedicated to transforming the practice of medicine by working to turn the impossible into the possible. We provide potentially life-changing treatment options and life-saving vaccine protection to millions of people globally  while putting sustainability and social responsibility at the center of our ambitions.Sanofi is listed on EURONEXT: SAN and NASDAQ: SNY.Media RelationsSally Bain | + 1 781 264 1091 | sally.bain@sanofi.comEvan Berland | + 1 215 432 0234 | evan.berland@sanofi.comInvestor RelationsEva Schaefer-Jansen | + 33 7 86 80 56 39 | eva.schaefer-jansen@sanofi.comArnaud Delépine | + 33 6 73 69 36 93 | arnaud.delepine@sanofi.comCorentine Driancourt | + 33 6 40 56 92 21 | corentine.driancourt@sanofi.comFelix Lauscher | + 1 908 612 7239 | felix.lauscher@sanofi.comTarik Elgoutni | + 1 617 710 3587 | tarik.elgoutni@sanofi.comNathalie Pham | + 33 7 85 93 30 17 | nathalie.pham@sanofi.comSanofi Disclaimers or Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995  as amended.

This SaaS version is included in the WALLIX PAM4OT package.To carry out their activities  organizations - in all sectors and especially in industry - rely on external service providers who  in order to fulfill their mission  need to connect to their IT infrastructure (traditional or industrial).SaaS Remote Access is aimed at all organizations wishing to provide digital access to their IT infrastructure to external service providers  thanks to simplified management while benefiting from the highest level of cybersecurity offered by a PAM leader recognized by Gartner.PARIS  April 4  2023 /PRNewswire/ -- WALLIX  (Euronext: ALLIX) a European cybersecurity software publisher expert in Access and Identity Solutions  launches SaaS Remote Access  the SaaS version of the remote access management technology integrated into WALLIX PAM4ALL  its unified privilege management solution. SaaS Remote Access is designed for organizations - across all sectors and in particular the industrial one - that want to provide digital access to their IT infrastructure to external providers through simplified management  while benefiting from the highest level of cybersecurity offered by a PAM leader recognized by Gartner.To carry out their business  organizations rely on external service providers who need to connect to their IT infrastructure (whether traditional or industrial). These can be remote maintainers  supply chain vendors  service providers  external consultants  etc.The problem for organizations is that these external stakeholders are numerous and can change constantly. In addition  the frequency and duration of their intervention vary according to the needs of the business and their requirements. This is why visualizing  managing  and securing their access becomes a real headache for IT teams. It is indeed vital for organizations to know who has access to what  from where  and why  as well as to manage access permissions. This is the only way to detect and stop any attempt at identity theft by a hacker  internal malice  or negligence  and thus protect data. The fact is that the cost of a cyberattack increases by an average of $370 000 if a third party is involved. Moreover  by implementing traceability through a security and digital access management solution  organizations also ensure regulatory compliance with current cybersecurity standards.Traditionally  in an attempt to manage external stakeholder access  the IT team will implement VPN technology  a secure ""tunnel"" between the external stakeholder's device and the organization's IT infrastructure. Except that  in reality  VPN vulnerabilities regularly make news headlines. On the other hand  implementing VPNs is a cumbersome and expensive process: each stakeholder must be referenced in Active Directory  the Microsoft software used by almost all organizations  which allows permissions to be managed and access to IT resources (data  servers  applications  software  etc.) to be controlled. And this technology does not meet the regulatory requirements either.The Answer: SaaS Remote AccessTo optimize the management of external service provider access  IT teams should turn to innovative solutions such as SaaS Remote Access.WALLIX PAM4ALL is a unified privilege management solution. It combines all WALLIX technologies: multi-factor authentication (MFA)  remote access management  session management  password management  and least privilege management. The solution secures all access to the IT infrastructure  ensuring data protection  detection  and resistance to cyberattacks and business continuity. It also ensures compliance with cybersecurity regulations.SaaS Remote Access is WALLIX PAM4ALL's ""remote access management"" technology now available as a service. It has been developed especially for the access management of external providers.This SaaS version of the WALLIX remote access management technology is also available in WALLIX PAM4OT  a packaged offer based on WALLIX PAM4ALL  dedicated to industrial companies and those that own industrial equipment (like hospitals with scanners  etc.).The advantages of subscribing to this functionality in SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) mode are:Ease of Deployment and UseThanks to SaaS mode  there is no need to install a new solution to replace VPNs; an Internet connection is all that is needed to access SaaS Remote Access. This allows better accessibility  flexibility  and cost reduction. In addition  thanks to its user-friendly interface  it is quick and easy for companies to register their external service providers and configure their access rights to authorized resources. This frees the IT team from these actions and allows them to focus on more value-added tasks.End-to-end SecurityThe digital identities and passwords of external stakeholders are no longer integrated into the organization's Active Directory but are managed and secured in SaaS Remote Access. This drastically reduces cyber risk  since the more digital identities in the Active Directory  the greater the chance of a hacker stealing them and then accessing all the resources of the person whose identity has been stolen. This also allows the organization to have an IT hygiene that follows cybersecurity and traceability standards  enabling cybersecurity by design.Full Visibility of External Remote AccessWith SaaS Remote Access  organizations regain control of external remote access. Companies create access for their external providers in real time for a defined period and are automatically removed once the task is completed. External providers connect to the organization's IT infrastructure through the SaaS Remote Access web portal and every action they take is monitored  providing full visibility and transparency.""With this remote access management for suppliers  we are both meeting the security challenges of IT teams and promoting the digital transformation of companies. We also give autonomy to business teams and put the digital experience at the heart of our solution: speed of access creation  fluidity of interactions with suppliers  and operational efficiency for all business and IT teams. Interacting with suppliers and maintaining a line of defense for digital access becomes extremely easy and cost-effective with our solution. The launch of this service for securing external access to IT and industrial infrastructures is only the first phase of WALLIX's SaaS strategy "" explains Edwige Brossard  Product & Marketing Director at WALLIX.www.wallix.com | info@wallix.comLogo - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1801456/3815089/Wallix_Logo.jpgSOURCE Wallix",neutral,0.24,0.76,0.0,mixed,0.24,0.07,0.69,True,English,"['SaaS Remote Access', 'digital access', 'external providers', 'secure way', 'WALLIX', 'agile', 'WALLIX remote access management technology', 'unified privilege management solution', 'European cybersecurity software publisher', 'remote access management"" technology', 'WALLIX PAM4ALL unified solution', 'external service provider access', 'digital access management solution', 'supply chain vendors', 'SaaS Remote Access', 'current cybersecurity standards', 'WALLIX PAM4OT package', 'external service providers', 'external stakeholder access', 'VPN technology', 'remote maintainers', 'new solution', 'external providers', 'simplified management', 'session management', 'password management', 'access rights', 'external consultants', 'external stakeholders', 'SaaS version', 'digital identities', 'WALLIX technologies', 'Microsoft software', 'access permissions', 'cybersecurity regulations', 'SaaS mode', 'IT infrastructure', 'highest level', 'PAM leader', 'Identity Solutions', 'real headache', 'IT teams', 'identity theft', 'internal malice', 'third party', 'secure ""tunnel', 'VPN vulnerabilities', 'news headlines', 'other hand', 'expensive process', 'Active Directory', 'IT resources', 'The Answer', 'innovative solutions', 'multi-factor authentication', 'Internet connection', 'user-friendly interface', 'authorized resources', 'value-added tasks', 'industrial one', 'industrial equipment', 'regulatory compliance', 'regulatory requirements', 'cost reduction', 'end Security', 'data protection', 'business continuity', 'industrial companies', 'activities', 'organizations', 'sectors', 'industry', 'order', 'Gartner', 'PARIS', 'April', 'PRNewswire', 'Euronext', 'expert', 'problem', 'addition', 'frequency', 'duration', 'intervention', 'needs', 'way', 'attempt', 'hacker', 'negligence', 'cyberattack', 'average', 'traceability', 'device', 'reality', 'VPNs', 'cumbersome', 'servers', 'applications', 'MFA', 'least', 'detection', 'resistance', 'offer', 'hospitals', 'scanners', 'advantages', 'functionality', 'Ease', 'Deployment', 'accessibility', 'flexibility', 'actions', 'passwords']",2023-04-04,2023-04-05,prnewswire.co.uk

The Chairperson reminds that voting during this AGM is not possible and the results of the voting shall be shown per agenda item at the end of this meeting. Annual Report 2021 2.1 - Management report for the financial year 2021 The Chairperson turns to item 2.1 on the agenda which concerns the performance of the Company in the financial year 2021  as explained in the Annual Report 2021 and gives the floor to Mr. Marco Piana  CEO of the Company  for a presentation about the highlights for 2021. Mr. Marco Piana  thanking the Chairperson  informs the attendees that throughout 2021 the Board has assessed a wide variety of companies in multiple sectors  including luxury and luxury value chain  lifestyle  physical retail  online retail  consumer services and beauty and personal care  in either a B2B or B2C capacity. The Board sources potential targets from e.g. their own network of contacts  including entrepreneurs  executives and financial investors. The Board keeps a ''long-list"" of potential targets and is currently in (early-stage) discussions with  or conducts preliminary due diligence on  a few of them. The focus of VAM Investments SPAC remains on a target in one of the target segments  in either a B2B or B2C capacity (although there is no guarantee that it will do so) and it will always seek to form a business combination with a target at an acceptable valuation for its shareholders. At the end of the financial year ended on 31 December 2021  the Company has not proposed a target to the business combination EGM. VAM Investments SPAC will continue its search for a proposed business combination with a target to be completed before the business combination deadline. The Chairperson informs the attendees that the news regarding the war in Ukraine is monitored. It is concerning and brings uncertainty for people and the economic environment. VAM Investments SPAC will continue to pursue a sound investment opportunity for its shareholders  but the Company cannot rule out that this conflict  or related matters like inflation or access to capital markets  will have an impact in the operations in due course. Mr. Marco Piana gives the floor to Mr. Carlo Di Biagio  CFO of the Company  who will give a presentation about the 2021 Financial Statements of the Company. Mr. Carlo Di Biagio thanks Mr. Marco Piana and informs that the Company has been listed on Euronext Amsterdam on 19 July 2021  raising around €210 million from a diversified investor base. The Company did not generate any revenues in the financial year 2021. The expenses incurred by the Company in the financial year 2021 include  amongst others  transaction costs  audit and advisory cost  legal fees  directors' fees  bank costs and negative interest. This has resulted in an after-tax loss of €3 154 802.43 over the period from 7 April 2021 (date of incorporation of VAM Investments SPAC) until 31 December 2021. The result is attributable to the negative interest rate payable on the escrow account plus a change in the market value of the warrants and incurring expenses  commissions and taxes in connection with the IPO and the subsequent search for a business combination. The negative interest in respect of the IPO proceeds held in the escrow account from 21 July 2021 to 31 December 2021 was paid from the part of the negative interest cover deposited in the escrow account  so that the entire amount of IPO proceeds was still held in the escrow account on 31 December 2021. 2.2 - Remuneration report for the financial year 2021 The Chairperson moves to item 2.2 on the agenda which is an advisory voting item  where the shareholders have been given the opportunity to vote on the remuneration report for the financial year 2021 and gives the floor to Mr. Marco Piana for a presentation about the 2021 Remuneration Report. Mr. Marco Piana thanks the Chairperson and informs the AGM that the directors and the CFO were all appointed on 16 July 2021 and that their remuneration was based on the remuneration policy adopted by the general meeting of the Company on 16 July 2021. In particular  Mr. Francesco Trapani is entitled to a gross annual fee of €35 000 for his position as executive director and chairman. Mr. Marco Piana is entitled to a gross annual fee of €50 000 for his position as executive director and CEO. Mr. Carlo di Biagio  CFO of the Company  is an external consultant and is entitled to a one-off fee of €50 000. Finally  each non-executive Director is entitled to a gross annual fee of €35 000. The remuneration report for 2021 takes into account the legal and statutory requirements with reference to page 27 of the 2021 annual report. 2.3 - Proposal to adopt the financial statements for the financial year 2021 The Chairperson moves to the next agenda item 2.3  which is a voting item concerning the proposal to the general meeting to adopt the Company's financial statements for the financial year 2021. For this agenda item  the Chairperson gives the floor to Beatrice Ballini. Ms. Beatrice Ballini thanks the Chairperson and informs that the annual report has been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (""IFRS"") as adopted by the European Union and the relevant provisions of the Dutch Civil Code. The directors have assessed whether the risk assessment executed showed any material failings in the effectiveness of the Company's internal risk management and control systems. Based on this assessment  to the best of the Board's knowledge and belief  no material failings of the effectiveness of the Company's internal risk management and control systems occurred and the internal risk and control systems provide reasonable assurance that the Company's financial statements do not contain any errors of material importance.

Fitusiran has the potential to provide prophylaxis for all types of hemophilia  regardless of inhibitor status  with as few as six subcutaneous injections per year.Dietmar Berger  M.D.  Ph.D.Head of Global R&D ad interim and Chief Medical Officer at Sanofi“Sanofi is committed to advancing the standard of care for all people with hemophilia through innovative science  providing consistent bleed protection while reducing treatment burden. We are entering a new era in hemophilia where  for the first time  people can choose therapies that meet their personal needs. These published data validate our science and add to a growing body of evidence supporting fitusiran’s potential to transform the treatment landscape. We look forward to sharing additional data on fitusiran later this year.”Both Phase 3 studies compared once-monthly subcutaneous fitusiran prophylaxis (80mg) with on-demand/episodic use of clotting factor concentrates in the ATLAS-A/B study  and on-demand/episodic use of bypassing agents in the ATLAS-INH study. Across both clinical studies  prophylactic treatment with fitusiran reduced annualized bleeding rates by 90% (95% CI [84.1%; 93.6%]  P <0.0001) compared to the control arms  showing a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in bleeding episodes when compared to on-demand treatments; and showed improvement in quality of life.In the study ATLAS-INH study published by The Lancet  66% of participants with inhibitors (25 out of 38) receiving fitusiran 80mg monthly experienced zero bleeding episodes compared to 5% (1 out of 19) receiving an on-demand bypassing agent after nine months of treatment.The ATLAS A/B study published in The Lancet Haematology showed 51% of participants without inhibitors (40 out of 79) who received fitusiran 80mg monthly prophylaxis experienced zero bleeds compared to 5% (2 out of 40) in the comparator group  receiving on-demand clotting factor concentrates.Sanofi is currently investigating the efficacy and safety of fitusiran under a revised regimen which includes lower doses and less frequent dosing (as few as six subcutaneous injections per year)  maintaining an antithrombin target range of 15-35% in all ongoing studies.ATLAS-AB Phase 3 StudyATLAS-A/B is a Phase 3 randomized  open-label study investigating the efficacy and safety of fitusiran in males ≥12 years with severe hemophilia A or B without inhibitors who had previously been treated with on-demand clotting factor concentrates. Study participants (n=120) were randomized 2:1 to receive either once-monthly 80mg subcutaneous fitusiran prophylaxis or on-demand clotting factor concentrates. The primary endpoint is annualized bleeding rate.ATLAS-INH Phase 3 StudyThe ATLAS-INH study is a randomized  open-label Phase 3 study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of fitusiran in males ≥12 years with severe hemophilia A or B with inhibitors to factor VIII or IX. Study participants (n=57) receiving on-demand treatment with bypassing agents (BPA) were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive once-monthly 80mg subcutaneous fitusiran prophylaxis or continue with on-demand BPA. The primary endpoint is annualized bleeding rate.About fitusiranFitusiran is an investigational  subcutaneously administered small interference RNA therapeutic in development for the prophylactic treatment of people with hemophilia A or B  with or without inhibitors. Fitusiran is designed to lower antithrombin  a protein that inhibits blood clotting  with the goal of promoting thrombin generation to rebalance hemostasis and prevent bleeds. Fitusiran utilizes Alnylam Pharmaceutical Inc.’s ESC-GalNAc conjugate technology  which enables subcutaneous dosing with increased potency and durability. Fitusiran is currently under clinical investigation and has not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives.

Fitusiran has the potential to provide prophylaxis for all types of hemophilia  regardless of inhibitor status  with as few as six subcutaneous injections per year.Dietmar Berger  M.D.  Ph.D.Head of Global R&D ad interim and Chief Medical Officer at Sanofi“Sanofi is committed to advancing the standard of care for all people with hemophilia through innovative science  providing consistent bleed protection while reducing treatment burden. We are entering a new era in hemophilia where  for the first time  people can choose therapies that meet their personal needs. These published data validate our science and add to a growing body of evidence supporting fitusiran’s potential to transform the treatment landscape. We look forward to sharing additional data on fitusiran later this year.”Both Phase 3 studies compared once-monthly subcutaneous fitusiran prophylaxis (80mg) with on-demand/episodic use of clotting factor concentrates in the ATLAS-A/B study  and on-demand/episodic use of bypassing agents in the ATLAS-INH study. Across both clinical studies  prophylactic treatment with fitusiran reduced annualized bleeding rates by 90% (95% CI [84.1%; 93.6%]  P <0.0001) compared to the control arms  showing a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in bleeding episodes when compared to on-demand treatments; and showed improvement in quality of life.In the study ATLAS-INH study published by The Lancet  66% of participants with inhibitors (25 out of 38) receiving fitusiran 80mg monthly experienced zero bleeding episodes compared to 5% (1 out of 19) receiving an on-demand bypassing agent after nine months of treatment.The ATLAS A/B study published in The Lancet Haematology showed 51% of participants without inhibitors (40 out of 79) who received fitusiran 80mg monthly prophylaxis experienced zero bleeds compared to 5% (2 out of 40) in the comparator group  receiving on-demand clotting factor concentrates.Sanofi is currently investigating the efficacy and safety of fitusiran under a revised regimen which includes lower doses and less frequent dosing (as few as six subcutaneous injections per year)  maintaining an antithrombin target range of 15-35% in all ongoing studies.ATLAS-AB Phase 3 StudyATLAS-A/B is a Phase 3 randomized  open-label study investigating the efficacy and safety of fitusiran in males ≥12 years with severe hemophilia A or B without inhibitors who had previously been treated with on-demand clotting factor concentrates. Study participants (n=120) were randomized 2:1 to receive either once-monthly 80mg subcutaneous fitusiran prophylaxis or on-demand clotting factor concentrates. The primary endpoint is annualized bleeding rate.ATLAS-INH Phase 3 StudyThe ATLAS-INH study is a randomized  open-label Phase 3 study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of fitusiran in males ≥12 years with severe hemophilia A or B with inhibitors to factor VIII or IX. Study participants (n=57) receiving on-demand treatment with bypassing agents (BPA) were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive once-monthly 80mg subcutaneous fitusiran prophylaxis or continue with on-demand BPA. The primary endpoint is annualized bleeding rate.About fitusiranFitusiran is an investigational  subcutaneously administered small interference RNA therapeutic in development for the prophylactic treatment of people with hemophilia A or B  with or without inhibitors. Fitusiran is designed to lower antithrombin  a protein that inhibits blood clotting  with the goal of promoting thrombin generation to rebalance hemostasis and prevent bleeds. Fitusiran utilizes Alnylam Pharmaceutical Inc.’s ESC-GalNAc conjugate technology  which enables subcutaneous dosing with increased potency and durability. Fitusiran is currently under clinical investigation and has not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives.

Overall  Sidetrade delivered a record year of bookings  posting nearly €6.5 million in new Annual Recurring Revenue up +36% overall with 51% from the United States. This performance provides excellent visibility for our revenue in 2023. Significantly  Sidetrade now achieves more than half of its revenue internationally  with 24% already generated in North America.In addition to our remarkable commercial successes  with a gross margin close to 80%  our efficient SaaS model enabled us to invest €7 million in North America for the full year while retaining an operating margin at 10% of our revenue. Sidetrade is one of those rare companies in the software industry that can invest heavily in North American expansion  with rapid and significant commercial success in return  while maintaining double-digit profitability.Sidetrade has effectively expanded its scale and we are proud to be recognized as one of the three global leaders in the Order-to-Cash segment. Despite a background of economic uncertainty  we enter 2023 with confidence and enthusiasm  strengthened by the bookings recorded in 2022. The market outlook is buoyant against a backdrop where many companies are under pressure to secure and improve their cash flow. Once more  our robust model – which maintains a healthy balance between growth and profitability – has served to develop our strongest ever market position.”Increased robustness thanks to a profitable growth modelSidetrade(€m) 2022 2021 Change New SaaS Subscriptions(New ARR) 6.44 4.75 36% of which North America 3.27 1.04 214% Revenue 36.8 32.6 +13% ‘Order-to-Cash’ Activities 35.9 30.3 +18% ‘Sales & Marketing’ Activities 0.9 2.3 -61% Gross margin 29.0 25.7 +13% as a % of Revenue 79% 79% Operating expenses (OPEX) (25.3) (20.7) +22% of which North America (7.0) (3.5) +100% Operating profit 3.7 5.0 -26% as a % of Revenue 10% 15% Net profit 3.4 4.7 -28%2022 accounts have been audited and will be certified after finalization of procedures required for the annual financial report.Record bookings in 2022  with more than €10 million in Annual Contract Value and €6.44 million in ARR  up +36%In 2022  Sidetrade achieved a +36% increase in Annual Recurring Revenue (“ARR”) which totaled €6.44 million. This performance reflects the strong demand for the Company's solutions  winning a growing number of new customers. In an ever-changing economic environment  the management of operating working capital  and particularly accounts receivable  is a major challenge for companies  irrespective of their sector.In 2022  bookings linked to services (implementation  configuration and training  excluding recurring services) also achieved robust growth of +37%  amounting to €3.84 million. Considering that almost all of these services will be invoiced over the next twelve months (excluding recurring services which can be invoiced over several years)  Sidetrade adds the equivalent of €10.28 million in Annual Contract Value (“ACV”)  representing a +36% increase.United States – a robust growth driver with 51% of bookings in 2022Sidetrade continued to increase international orders  which represented 66% of all bookings in 2022. The commercial success in the United States was especially significant on a half-yearly basis  since the US already represented more than half the total bookings (51%) on a full-year basis in 2022.The contracts won in preference over American competitors demonstrate  on the one hand  Sidetrade’s technological edge – recognized as one of the three global leaders in Gartner’s 2022 Magic Quadrant™ for Integrated Invoice-to-Cash applications – and on the other  the delivery capacity and execution of the salesforce  which will continue its ramp-up in the quarters ahead.In 2022  Sidetrade reported a dramatic increase of +60% in the total value of these new subscription contracts (“Total Contract Value” or “TCV”) over their initial contract periods (excluding renewals and services) which reached €20.7 million. In particular  this surge is attributed to an extension of the initial contract period for new customers (excluding renewals) to 44.9 months  thereby increasing the economic model’s high predictability.Overall  in FY 2022  bookings by new customers and cross-selling represented 80% of total bookings  with the remaining 20% of bookings accounting for upselling of additional modules to existing customers compared to 28% in FY 2021.Lastly  churn rate for enterprise accounts remains under control at 3.83% as of December 31  2022  significantly below the SaaS industry’s average of 14% according to the “2022 Private SaaS Company Survey Results “ by KeyBanc Capital Markets.Strong increase in ‘Order-to-Cash’ revenue to +18%  driven by 'Order-to-Cash' SaaS subscriptions  up 22%‘Order-to-Cash’ activities  which form a core business within the Company’s strategy  represented 98% of total revenue at end-2022. In FY 2022  these activities increased by +18%  mainly due to strong growth in SaaS subscriptions (+22%). This increase is the result of record bookings in the 2021 fiscal year and early fiscal 2022  which continued to have an impact throughout the 2022 fiscal year.As announced  the ‘Sales & Marketing’ activities accounted for only 2% of total revenue at end-2022  and will continue to decline  with estimated revenue of €0.5 million at end-2023. In 2022  the negative impact on total revenue growth was 5% (18% for ‘Order-to-Cash’ activities vs. 13% growth in total) and will automatically have considerably less impact in 2023.Sidetrade’s revenue is also underpinned by vigorous growth in international markets which  for the first time  represents more than half its revenue (54% of total revenue)  including 24% for North America.Total revenue grew by +13% in FY 2022  to €36.8 million.With a backdrop of economic uncertainty  Sidetrade’s economic model provides its business with significant resilience  as 90% of its revenue is recurring. It should be noted that all Sidetrade subscription contracts  including new contracts  contain an annual automatic price re-indexation clause based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the relevant country.With its sound fundamentals and a highly favorable growth outlook  Sidetrade has excellent pricing power that protects the Company’s future revenue against inflationary pressures.In respect to fiscal 2022  the impact of exchange rates on the Company was not material.Strong results in a context of accelerating investmentOutstanding gross margin at 79% of revenue  above the SaaS industry averageGross margin remained at a very high level  topping out at 79% of revenue for 2022  with a rate of 92% on SaaS subscriptions alone. This performance was driven both by a commercial strategy to promote Sidetrade’s technological edge and costs which were kept under control in an inflationary environment.Sidetrade continues to illustrate the robustness of its SaaS model  which generates significant incremental gross margin  year after year.Double-digit profitability at 10%  despite investment of €7 million in North AmericaOperating profit for 2022 totaled €3.7 million  representing 10% of revenue. The Group retained its profitability in double digits under the combined impact of revenue growth  an excellent gross margin and efficient cost control.Bolstered by its robust economic model  Sidetrade has undertaken an unprecedented effort to accelerate investment in North America  which amounted to €7 million in 2022  focused on building a team of 52 colleagues in the region to end of 2022.Operating profit for 2022 includes a French Research Tax Credit and subsidies of €2.7 million (vs. €2.2 million in 2021) as well as activation of €0.3 million in marginal R&D costs  i.e. 4% of R&D costs for the full year.Corporate income tax for 2022 totaled €0.4 million  versus €0.3 million in 2021.All told  Sidetrade’s net profit for 2022 was €3.4 million  demonstrating that growth and profitability are achievable while investing.Solid financial positionSidetrade reported €20.3 million in gross cash at year-end (vs. €18 million in 2021). As of December 31  2022  Sidetrade also holds 85 000 of its own shares with a value of €12.8 million.Sidetrade’s financial debt stands at €12 million (fixed rate at 1.1%)  giving the Group significant investment capacity to accelerate its expansion.Responsible growth for Sidetrade with a full assessment of its environmental impactIn addition to its robust financial results  Sidetrade is committed to a CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) approach. The latter centers on integrating ESG (Environmental  Social  Governance) challenges into its company strategy.While Sidetrade is not yet bound by regulatory requirements  as an industry-recognized leader  the Company understands the significant role it has in shaping a more responsible and sustainable future. With this in mind  Sidetrade has already performed a comprehensive Carbon Assessment (scopes 1  2 and 3) for FY 2022  which applies to activities and regions across the board. This assessment helped the Group to pinpoint the main greenhouse gas emission sources and identify concrete actions to regulate them.Humble in its approach  Sidetrade is committed to a purposeful and proactive CSR strategy  backed by its participation in the United Nations Global Compact (see press release of 15 February 2023 ) and in compliance with the European Union’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). Through this commitment  the Company is convinced that it will cement its industry-leading position.Strengthened by these results  Sidetrade looks ahead to fiscal 2023 with confidence and a clear vision and has the resources to fulfill its ambitions.Next financial announcementFirst Quarter Revenue for 2023: May 10  2023  after the stock market closes.Investor & Media relationsChristelle Dhrif +33 6 10 46 72 00 cdhrif@sidetrade.comAbout Sidetrade ( www.sidetrade.com )Sidetrade (Euronext Growth: ALBFR.PA) provides a SaaS platform dedicated to securing and accelerating cash flow.

NOT FOR RELEASE  PUBLICATION OR DISTRIBUTION IN OR INTO  OR TO ANY PERSON LOCATED OR RESIDENT IN  ANY OTHER JURISDICTION WH…,The Hague  April 4  2023 - FOR DISTRIBUTION ONLY OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES TO PERSONS OTHER THAN “U.S. PERSONS” (AS DEFINED IN REGULATION S UNDER THE UNITED STATES SECURITIES ACT OF 1933  AS AMENDED (THE “SECURITIES ACT”)). NOT FOR RELEASE  PUBLICATION OR DISTRIBUTION IN OR INTO  OR TO ANY PERSON LOCATED OR RESIDENT IN  ANY OTHER JURISDICTION WHERE IT IS UNLAWFUL TO RELEASE  PUBLISH OR DISTRIBUTE THIS DOCUMENT.Aegon N.V. (Aegon) announces the invitation to the eligible holders of its outstanding USD 500 000 000 Perpetual Capital Securities (ISIN: NL0000116168) (the Securities) to consent to the modification of the terms and conditions of the Securities. The terms of the Securities feature a coupon rate that is calculated using a LIBOR-referencing swap rate  which is expected to be discontinued from June 30  2023. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC) has issued a recommendation for the substitution of LIBOR-referencing swap rates with Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) -referencing swap rates. Aegon is proposing a simplified variation to the ARRC recommendation  which essentially comprises two elements. A substitution of the references to “USD CMS-10 year” (the 10-year USD LIBOR Ice Swap Rate (ISR) in the interest provisions of the Securities by “10-year SOFR ISR” and a fixed spread adjustment to compensate holders for certain differences between the two swap rates. In addition  updated fallback provisions will be included to cater for any future discontinuation of the SOFR ISR.The consent solicitation is subject to the terms and conditions contained in the consent solicitation memorandum dated April 4  2023. The consent solicitation memorandum and the full consent solicitation launch announcement are available from the solicitation agent and/or the tabulation agent as set out below.Rationale for the consent solicitationThe Securities feature a quarterly floating rate coupon equal to the 10-year USD LIBOR ISR plus 0.1 per cent.  subject to an 8.5 per cent. maximum. This LIBOR-referencing swap rate is widely expected to cease to be published by any administrator and/or will no longer be representative immediately after June 30  2023 (cessation). The terms of the Securities do not provide for a fallback that can be used to determine the floating rate coupon post-cessation. To avoid a situation where no coupon rate can be established and no coupon can be paid  Aegon has chosen to launch a consent solicitation in order to amend the floating rate coupon calculation.Details of the consent solicitationThe proposed changes are limited to the interest rate provisions within the terms of the Securities and are aimed at remediating the embedded LIBOR coupon and introducing updated fallback provisions. The ARRC has published recommendations in relation to the substitution of LIBOR-referencing swap rates. The ARRC recommendation advocates calculation of the replacement rate by application of a sophisticated formula based on SOFR-referencing swap rates with some technical adjustments to account for differences in payment frequency and day count conventions  with a variable spread adjustment. Aegon is proposing to apply a simplified approach using the ARRC formula  which would result in a fixed spread adjustment rather than a variable spread adjustment per quarter. This simplified approach derives the spread adjustment for moving from a 10-year LIBOR-referencing swap rate to a 10-year SOFR-referencing swap rate as of242 March 31  2023.The proposed methodology is considered by Aegon as appropriate to achieve an economically neutral outcome  considering various factors including  but not limited to  general industry and market feedback for the active transition of USD LIBOR-referencing securities. Aegon has considered exercising the call option available in the terms of the Securities but has concluded that this would not be in the economic interest of the company.Spread adjustment and new floating rate couponBased on the 10-year SOFR -referencing swap rate of 3.242 per cent. on March 31  2023  the proposed spread adjustment is 0.28753 per cent. In the opinion of Aegon  the proposed approach should provide a beneficial outcome for holders of the Securities compared to applying the specific formula recommended by the ARRC. The ARRC approach would lead to a variable spread depending on the 10-year SOFR -referencing swap rate  with a maximum spread adjustment of 0.28767 per cent. for a swap rate of 3.01 per cent.The simplified approach to calculate the spread adjustment effectively fixes the spread adjustment close to the maximum spread under the ARRC approach. In case the eligible holders consent to the proposed modifications  the Securities will have a quarterly floating rate coupon equal to the 10-year SOFR ISR plus 0.38753 per cent (the sum of the original credit spread and the spread adjustment)  subject to an 8.5 per cent maximum.Indicative timetable for the consent solicitationThe consent solicitation commences today and the final deadline for receipt by the tabulation agent of consent instructions and voting forms is 10.00 a.m. CET on April 19  2023. This will also be the deadline for making any other arrangements to attend or be represented or to vote at the consent solicitation meeting. The meeting will commence at 10.00 a.m. (CET) on April 21  2023 at the offices of Allen & Overy LLP  Apollolaan 15  1077 AB Amsterdam  the Netherlands.The results of the meeting will be announced as soon as reasonably practicable after the meeting. If the necessary quorum  based on eligible holders only  for the meeting is not obtained the meeting will be adjourned and a new meeting will be announced in due course. In case holders of the Securities would not consent to the modification of the terms and conditions of the Securities  Aegon will consider other options to amend the coupon calculation.HSBC Continental Europe (Telephone: +44 20 7992 6237; Attention: Liability Management  DCM; Email: LM_EMEA@hsbc.com) is acting as the solicitation agent and Kroll Issuer Services Limited (Telephone: +44 207 704 0880; Attention: Paul Kamminga / Arlind Bytyqi; Email: aegon@is.kroll.com; Website: https://deals.is.kroll.com/aegon) is acting as tabulation agent.Holders are advised the read carefully the consent solicitation memorandum for full details of and information on the consent solicitation.

This SaaS version is included in the WALLIX PAM4OT package.To carry out their activities  organizations - in all sectors and especially in industry - rely on external service providers who  in order to fulfill their mission  need to connect to their IT infrastructure (traditional or industrial).SaaS Remote Access is aimed at all organizations wishing to provide digital access to their IT infrastructure to external service providers  thanks to simplified management while benefiting from the highest level of cybersecurity offered by a PAM leader recognized by Gartner.PARIS  April 4  2023 /PRNewswire/ -- WALLIX  (Euronext: ALLIX) a European cybersecurity software publisher expert in Access and Identity Solutions  launches SaaS Remote Access  the SaaS version of the remote access management technology integrated into WALLIX PAM4ALL  its unified privilege management solution. SaaS Remote Access is designed for organizations - across all sectors and in particular the industrial one - that want to provide digital access to their IT infrastructure to external providers through simplified management  while benefiting from the highest level of cybersecurity offered by a PAM leader recognized by Gartner.To carry out their business  organizations rely on external service providers who need to connect to their IT infrastructure (whether traditional or industrial). These can be remote maintainers  supply chain vendors  service providers  external consultants  etc.The problem for organizations is that these external stakeholders are numerous and can change constantly. In addition  the frequency and duration of their intervention vary according to the needs of the business and their requirements. This is why visualizing  managing  and securing their access becomes a real headache for IT teams. It is indeed vital for organizations to know who has access to what  from where  and why  as well as to manage access permissions. This is the only way to detect and stop any attempt at identity theft by a hacker  internal malice  or negligence  and thus protect data. The fact is that the cost of a cyberattack increases by an average of $370 000 if a third party is involved. Moreover  by implementing traceability through a security and digital access management solution  organizations also ensure regulatory compliance with current cybersecurity standards.Traditionally  in an attempt to manage external stakeholder access  the IT team will implement VPN technology  a secure ""tunnel"" between the external stakeholder's device and the organization's IT infrastructure. Except that  in reality  VPN vulnerabilities regularly make news headlines. On the other hand  implementing VPNs is a cumbersome and expensive process: each stakeholder must be referenced in Active Directory  the Microsoft software used by almost all organizations  which allows permissions to be managed and access to IT resources (data  servers  applications  software  etc.) to be controlled. And this technology does not meet the regulatory requirements either.The Answer: SaaS Remote AccessTo optimize the management of external service provider access  IT teams should turn to innovative solutions such as SaaS Remote Access.WALLIX PAM4ALL is a unified privilege management solution. It combines all WALLIX technologies: multi-factor authentication (MFA)  remote access management  session management  password management  and least privilege management. The solution secures all access to the IT infrastructure  ensuring data protection  detection  and resistance to cyberattacks and business continuity. It also ensures compliance with cybersecurity regulations.SaaS Remote Access is WALLIX PAM4ALL's ""remote access management"" technology now available as a service. It has been developed especially for the access management of external providers.This SaaS version of the WALLIX remote access management technology is also available in WALLIX PAM4OT  a packaged offer based on WALLIX PAM4ALL  dedicated to industrial companies and those that own industrial equipment (like hospitals with scanners  etc.).The advantages of subscribing to this functionality in SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) mode are:Ease of Deployment and UseThanks to SaaS mode  there is no need to install a new solution to replace VPNs; an Internet connection is all that is needed to access SaaS Remote Access. This allows better accessibility  flexibility  and cost reduction. In addition  thanks to its user-friendly interface  it is quick and easy for companies to register their external service providers and configure their access rights to authorized resources. This frees the IT team from these actions and allows them to focus on more value-added tasks.End-to-end SecurityThe digital identities and passwords of external stakeholders are no longer integrated into the organization's Active Directory but are managed and secured in SaaS Remote Access. This drastically reduces cyber risk  since the more digital identities in the Active Directory  the greater the chance of a hacker stealing them and then accessing all the resources of the person whose identity has been stolen. This also allows the organization to have an IT hygiene that follows cybersecurity and traceability standards  enabling cybersecurity by design.Full Visibility of External Remote AccessWith SaaS Remote Access  organizations regain control of external remote access. Companies create access for their external providers in real time for a defined period and are automatically removed once the task is completed. External providers connect to the organization's IT infrastructure through the SaaS Remote Access web portal and every action they take is monitored  providing full visibility and transparency.""With this remote access management for suppliers  we are both meeting the security challenges of IT teams and promoting the digital transformation of companies. We also give autonomy to business teams and put the digital experience at the heart of our solution: speed of access creation  fluidity of interactions with suppliers  and operational efficiency for all business and IT teams. Interacting with suppliers and maintaining a line of defense for digital access becomes extremely easy and cost-effective with our solution. The launch of this service for securing external access to IT and industrial infrastructures is only the first phase of WALLIX's SaaS strategy "" explains Edwige Brossard  Product & Marketing Director at WALLIX.www.wallix.com | [email protected]Logo - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1801456/3815089/Wallix_Logo.jpgSOURCE Wallix",neutral,0.24,0.76,0.0,mixed,0.24,0.07,0.69,True,English,"['SaaS Remote Access', 'digital access', 'external providers', 'secure way', 'WALLIX', 'agile', 'WALLIX remote access management technology', 'unified privilege management solution', 'European cybersecurity software publisher', 'remote access management"" technology', 'WALLIX PAM4ALL unified solution', 'external service provider access', 'digital access management solution', 'supply chain vendors', 'SaaS Remote Access', 'current cybersecurity standards', 'WALLIX PAM4OT package', 'external service providers', 'external stakeholder access', 'VPN technology', 'remote maintainers', 'new solution', 'external providers', 'simplified management', 'session management', 'password management', 'access rights', 'external consultants', 'external stakeholders', 'SaaS version', 'digital identities', 'WALLIX technologies', 'Microsoft software', 'access permissions', 'cybersecurity regulations', 'SaaS mode', 'IT infrastructure', 'highest level', 'PAM leader', 'Identity Solutions', 'real headache', 'IT teams', 'identity theft', 'internal malice', 'third party', 'secure ""tunnel', 'VPN vulnerabilities', 'news headlines', 'other hand', 'expensive process', 'Active Directory', 'IT resources', 'The Answer', 'innovative solutions', 'multi-factor authentication', 'Internet connection', 'user-friendly interface', 'authorized resources', 'value-added tasks', 'industrial one', 'industrial equipment', 'regulatory compliance', 'regulatory requirements', 'cost reduction', 'end Security', 'data protection', 'business continuity', 'industrial companies', 'activities', 'organizations', 'sectors', 'industry', 'order', 'Gartner', 'PARIS', 'April', 'PRNewswire', 'Euronext', 'expert', 'problem', 'addition', 'frequency', 'duration', 'intervention', 'needs', 'way', 'attempt', 'hacker', 'negligence', 'cyberattack', 'average', 'traceability', 'device', 'reality', 'VPNs', 'cumbersome', 'servers', 'applications', 'MFA', 'least', 'detection', 'resistance', 'offer', 'hospitals', 'scanners', 'advantages', 'functionality', 'Ease', 'Deployment', 'accessibility', 'flexibility', 'actions', 'passwords']",2023-04-04,2023-04-05,prnewswire.com

April 4  2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Sanofi and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA)  part of the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR) within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)  celebrated today the groundbreaking of a new  state-of-the-art formulation and filling facility at Sanofi's Swiftwater site in Pennsylvania.The new formulation and filling facility will be a two-story building complete with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) formulation  filling  and support areas. The filler will be capable of filling syringe and vials using isolator barrier technology and single use technology for flexibility. This manufacturing facility represents one of three significant manufacturing investments made at the site  supported by federal funds  as part of a contract awarded earlier on December 5  2019 by BARDA to increase domestic production capabilities for recombinant pandemic influenza vaccines.Rakesh KakkarUS Head of Vaccine Manufacturing and Supply  Sanofi""This groundbreaking event marks another significant step in our longstanding relationship with BARDA. Past pandemics confirmed that public-private partnerships are key to providing a relevant and quick answer to pandemic situations. Our Swiftwater site  and Sanofi teams globally  have the highest level of expertise in helping to protect people against flu and its complications. We are committed to maintaining continuous efforts to prepare for the next flu pandemic.""The Sanofi-BARDA contract supports the clinical development of an adjuvanted recombinant pandemic influenza vaccine that utilizes the same technology as Sanofi's recombinant quadrivalent influenza vaccine. The contract also expands the Swiftwater site's capacity to be a center of excellence for pandemic preparedness by enhancing vaccine manufacturing  adding both recombinant and adjuvant technologies to the current egg-based platform capabilities.This project has been supported in whole or in part with federal funds from the Department of Health and Human Services; Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response; Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA)  under contract number 75A50120D00002.About Pandemic PreparednessAs the world's largest manufacturer of seasonal flu vaccines  Sanofi has established capability and can play its part to bring any new pandemic infection under control. Sanofi has extensive expertise and experience in flu prevention  providing over 250 million doses of flu vaccines every year to more than 120 countries. Sanofi also developed and registered vaccines to address the 2009 A/HIN1 pandemic in a matter of weeks.Egg-based vaccine supply would well contribute to support a global influenza pandemic response should it arise either from A/H5N1 or any other influenza strain. The objective of Sanofi's contract with BARDA is to expand pandemic influenza preparedness and leverage another – recombinant  protein-based – technology to deliver a pandemic vaccine.About Recombinant TechnologyProduction of recombinant flu vaccines does not require an egg or cell-grown vaccine virus or the candidate vaccine virus. Instead  recombinant vaccines are created synthetically by using the virus's genetic instructions  ensuring exact match of the vaccine with the circulating virus strain.About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people's lives. Our team  across some 100 countries  is dedicated to transforming the practice of medicine by working to turn the impossible into the possible. We provide potentially life-changing treatment options and life-saving vaccine protection to millions of people globally  while putting sustainability and social responsibility at the center of our ambitions.Sanofi is listed on EURONEXT: SAN andNASDAQ: SNY.Media RelationsSally Bain | + 1 781 264 1091 | [email protected]Evan Berland | + 1 215 432 0234 | [email protected]Investor RelationsEva Schaefer-Jansen | + 33 7 86 80 56 39 | [email protected]Arnaud Delépine | + 33 6 73 69 36 93 | [email protected]Corentine Driancourt | + 33 6 40 56 92 21 | [email protected]Felix Lauscher | + 1 908 612 7239 | [email protected]Tarik Elgoutni | + 1 617 710 3587 | [email protected]Nathalie Pham | + 33 7 85 93 30 17 | [email protected]Sanofi Disclaimers or Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995  as amended.

The Report will shortly be available from the Company’s website: https://www.castelnaugroup.com Summary Information The Group Castelnau Group Limited (the “Company” or “CGL”) and its subsidiary (collectively  the “Group” or “Castelnau Group”) is a Guernsey domiciled closed-ended investment company which was incorporated in Guernsey on 13 March 2020 under the Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008. The Company is classified as a registered fund under the Protection of Investors (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Law 2020. Its registered office address is PO Box 255  Les Banques  Trafalgar Court  St. Peter Port  Guernsey GY1 3QL. The Company listed on the London Stock Exchange’s Specialist Fund Segment (“SFS”) on 18 October 2021. This Annual Report and Audited Consolidated Financial Statements (the “Financial Statements” or the “Consolidated Financial Statements”) comprise the Financial Statements of Castelnau Group Limited and Castelnau Group Services Limited (incorporated on 14 June 2022). Investment Objective The Group's investment objective is to compound Shareholders’ capital at a higher rate of return than the FTSE All Share Total Return Index over the long term. Investment Policy The Group will seek to achieve a high rate of compound return over the long term by carefully selecting investments using a thorough and objective research process and paying a price which provides a material margin of safety against permanent loss of capital  but also a favourable range of outcomes. The Group will follow a high conviction investment strategy. The expertise and processes developed by the Investment Manager can be applied to all parts of the capital structure of a business  both private and publicly quoted. These positions could be represented by a minority stake  a control position combined with operational involvement  full ownership of a company  a joint venture  a loan or convertible instrument  a short position or any other instrument which allows the Group to access value. The Group may select investments from all asset classes  geographies and all parts of the capital structure of a business. Both private and public markets are within the scope of the Group’s investment policy. The constraints on the Investment Manager lie in the high standards  strict hurdles and diligent processes used to select investments. These constraints help to maximise returns by reducing mistakes  enforcing a margin of safety and only accepting investments with a favourable range of outcomes. The Group expects to hold a concentrated portfolio of investments and the Group will not seek to reduce concentration risk through diversification. The opportunity set will dictate the number of holdings and the weighting of investments in the Portfolio. The investments with the best return profiles will receive the largest weightings. The Group will therefore have no set diversification policies. The volatility of mark-to-market prices does not affect the investment process. It is likely that volatility in the market price of a listed investment will provide attractive entry or exit points and so investors should expect high volatility to sit alongside the high long-term compounding rates that the Group is aiming to achieve. The constituents of local indices  the weightings of investments in these indices and the volatility of the indices relative to the Group will not affect investment decisions. It is anticipated that agnosticism towards local indices will help focus research efforts  decision making and ultimately investment performance. The Group may invest directly or through special purpose vehicles if considered appropriate. Shareholder Information The total number of Ordinary Shares in the Group in issue immediately following Admission was 177 552 719.

Chair’s Statement Performance Review This report covers a twelve-month period from 1 January 2022 to 31 December 2022. The total number of Ordinary Shares in the Company at the period end date was 183 996 059. The NAV total return for the year ended 31 December 2022  was -19.81%  and the share price return was -34.6%  versus the benchmark FTSE All Share Total Return Index of +0.3%  that’s a -20.1% relative underperformance of the NAV. The main contributors to the underperformance were Dignity Plc  Phoenix S.G. Ltd and Hornby Plc. Dignity Plc represents 31.2% of the portfolio and had a -29.7% price movement. Hornby Plc. represents 19.1% of the portfolio and had a -31.3% price movement. Additional commentary around the underperformance on both stocks can be found further down in the Investment Managers report. Reflective of the changing business and wider economic environment  the discount rate used for valuing our privately held investments was also increased  in line with the wider market. 31 December 2022 31 December 2021 Cambium International Ltd. - Core business 12.5% 12.5% Cambium International Ltd. - *Little List business 25% N/A Phoenix S.G. Ltd 12% 15% Rawnet Ltd. 15% 15% *Little List is a new strategy The CGL share price predominantly traded at a premium to NAV throughout the period. The Board  along with Liberum Capital Limited (the “Advisers”) and the Investment Manager  monitor the premium or discount on an ongoing basis. Whilst we are naturally disappointed with the NAV total return and the share price return  this is a long-term investment and it is still early days for the Company. We continue to have confidence in the strategic actions taken by the Investment Manager and look forward to seeing this reflected in the NAV total return and the share price return over time. Outlook Although while the short-term performance is disappointing  the outlook for the future is very promising. New CEOs were hired by three of the businesses in 2022: Dignity Plc  Hornby Plc and Stanley Gibbons Plc. The Castelnau team at Phoenix were heavily involved in the recruitment process and hiring these individuals is a fundamental step forward for all three businesses. 2022 was a year of high activity between the Castelnau team at Phoenix and the management teams of the portfolio companies. Much foundational work is going on behind the scenes to offer support and practical help with business strategy  capital allocation  leadership  and culture. The announcement of the offer to acquire Dignity Plc. is of great significance to the future success of the Company. The partnership with SPWOne and the industry expertise Sir Peter Wood and his team bring to the table are key components in Dignity’s transformation. We are very excited by this proposition and the future value creation from this investment. It is sure to keep everyone very busy over the next 12 months. Documents relating to this transaction can be found here; https://www.castelnaugroup.com/investor-relations/Offer-for-Dignity-Plc Significant opportunities lie ahead for Castelnau Group. We have a clear vision and strategy for growth and believe that we are well-positioned going into 2023. We remain committed to delivering value to our shareholders  and are confident that the outlook for the Company is very promising.

The only additional investment was made in Silverwood Brands plc (“Silverwood”) for 0.7 GBP per share  where the equity position represents 1.6% of the total NAV and the loan position less than 5%. Additional information on this investment can be found later in this report. In addition to the investment in Silverwood mentioned above  the Company topped up its position in The Cambium Group by £15.7 million and in Ocula by £0.7 million. The Cambium Group capital raise allowed the company to clear its debt taken out to survive the Covid pandemic  provide funds for a new Baby List business  a stake in Hostology (an events software management business) and for further investment in the business. In December 2022  the Company valued the original loan of £3 million to Ocula Technologies at £nil. Post year end the loan was written off. This facilitated Ocula securing Lloyds as their first external shareholder  which is a significant step forward for Ocula. Less than two years since its formation  it values Ocula on a post new money basis of £10 million. The initial loan from the Company was in effect equity-like and post the Lloyds investment the Company owns 49% for a total investment of £3.7 million. The additional investment in Ocula enabled the Company to secure external investors as part of a funding round that started in the summer of last year. This has proven very fruitful and we are glad to report that on the 6 March 2023  Ocula confirmed that it has received new investment from Lloyds Banking Group and their Fintech Investment Team. Lloyds Banking Group’s investment is in the form of new equity capital and completes the funding round previously announced in November 2022. The Group considers both qualitative and quantitative factors when determining whether an asset may be impaired. The Group considered the following indications of impairment across the corporate loans outstanding at year end: – default or delinquency by a debtor; – restructuring of an amount due to the Group on terms that the Group would not consider otherwise; – indications that a debtor or issuer will enter bankruptcy; – adverse changes in the payment status of borrowers; or – observable data indicating that there is a measurable decrease in the expected cash flows from a group of financial assets. The Group considers a broad range of information when assessing credit risk and measuring expected credit losses  including past events  current conditions  reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the expected collectability of the future cash flows of the instrument. There have been no historical credit losses on the corporate loans issued by the Group. The Group has assessed the credit risk of the loans and has concluded that they have not deteriorated significantly in credit quality since initial recognition. The NAV per share for the year decreased by 19.81% and underperformed the benchmark which was up 0.3%. The main contributors to the underperformance in the year were Dignity Plc  ( 31.2% of the total portfolio)  Phoenix SG Ltd (13.9% of the total portfolio) and Hornby Plc (19.1% of the portfolio). Dignity Plc During the course of the year  Dignity continued to implement the new strategy as set out in the company’s 2021 annual report. The company is going through significant transformation in operations  culture  customer acquisition and proposition  and capital structure. These included becoming fully FCA regulated  a marked change in its pricing strategy and staff shortages particularly through the middle and latter part of the year. As part of the new strategy  the company experienced a significant amount of operational change which impacted its profitability. Following the end of the year  Castelnau was part of a consortium  alongside PAMP and SPWOne  an entity controlled by Sir Peter Wood  which made a bid for Dignity. Details below: On the 1 of February  the Company announced publication of a prospectus outlining the details of the bid for Dignity. Gary Channon  CIO of Phoenix Asset Management Partners Ltd commented as follows: “Buying Dignity is a game changer for Castelnau. It brings together all the best of what Castelnau is about in a transaction that will change our scale and add considerably to upside value. We expect great things of this partnership with Sir Peter Wood and his team  and today's announced capital raise will allow existing and new investors to participate in it.” Details from the prospectus can be found below. Articles relating to the deal can be found here on the Company’s website: https://www.castelnaugroup.com/investor-relations/Offer-for-Dignity-Plc “On 23 January 2023  the boards of directors of Dignity plc (“Dignity”) and Yellow (SPC) Bidco Limited (“Bidco”)  a newly formed company indirectly owned or controlled by a consortium comprised joint offerors SPWOne V Limited  Castelnau Group Limited (“Castelnau” or the “Company”) and Phoenix Asset Management Partners Limited (“PAMP” and  together with SPWOne V Limited and Castelnau  the “Consortium”)  announced that they had reached agreement on the terms of a recommended cash offer to be made by Bidco to acquire the entire issued and to be issued share capital of Dignity  other than the Dignity shares already owned or controlled by Castelnau and PAMP (the “Announcement”). Further to the Announcement  Castelnau has today published a prospectus (the “Prospectus”) containing details of: a proposed issue of up to 133 052 656 new Ordinary Shares to be issued by the Company in connection with the acquisition of Dignity Plc (the ""Takeover Offer"");a proposed issue of up to 32 442 740 Ordinary Shares to be issued by the Company pursuant to the Consortium Rollover;a placing of up to 154 000 000 Ordinary Shares at 75.02p (the ""Issue Price"") per Ordinary Share (the ""Placing""); anda placing programme for up to 300 000 000 Ordinary Shares and/or C Shares (the ""Placing Programme"") The Placing is intended to raise proceeds to assist with the funding of the Company's cash funding obligation pursuant to the Takeover Offer and  if sufficient  further investment in accordance with the Company’s investment policy. The subsequent Placing Programme allows the Company to issue up to a further 300 million Ordinary Shares and/or C Shares (together the ""Shares"")  in aggregate  in the twelve months from the date of the Prospectus”. Hornby Plc With the help of Castelnau  Hornby have now appointed a new CEO  Olly Raeburn  who joined the group on 23 January 2023. Much of the foundational work has been put in place at Hornby over the last few years and we believe that Olly’s experience in marketing  customer communication and strategy is ideally suited to take Hornby forward. Hornby released a half yearly trading statement (March 2022 - September 2022) on 24 of November 2022 where it reported group revenue for the six months to September 2022 of £22.4 million which was 3% higher than the prior year (2021: £21.8 million). The gross margin for the period was 48% (2021: 46%)  a slight increase reflecting the product/channel mix in the first half of 2022 compared to prior year. The operating loss before exceptional costs (including IFRS 16) for the six months to September 2022 was £2.6 million compared to a loss of £0.3 million for the same period last year. This is due to the continued high cost of shipping containers  increased overheads as mentioned above and a non-cash share-based payment of £0.5 million. Hornby Group loss before tax was £2.9 million (2021: loss of £0.7 million). The basic loss per share was 1.29p (2021: loss per share of 0.45p). Direct sales via Hornby’s websites during the half-year ended 30 September 2022 were 54% higher than those achieved in the prior year. We believe that the long-term potential of both of these businesses is as strong as ever and the actions that have been taken over the past twelve months have improved the likelihood that this potential will be realised.Phoenix SG Ltd The investment was down 15.6% in the period. The Group’s trading performance and operations have slowly improved since the COVID-19 pandemic as a result of the increased mobility and effective sales effort. As of March 2022  the revenue of the Group was up by 22% year-on-year  with a decreased total loss of £1.7 million for the financial period ending 2022. Philatelic and numismatic sales were lower than expected for the year. This was exacerbated in philately by higher than anticipated sales of old Great Britain stock at lower margins. In publications  the magazines  album & accessories margins were ahead of budget but cancelled out by the lower margins achieved on catalogues. Overheads increased due to unbudgeted legal costs around the pension negotiations. The shares of Stanley Gibbons PLC were delisted in September 2022  the same month which saw the arrival of the new CEO  Tom Pickford. Tom is currently working on a new vision and strategy for the group. In the short term  he believes there is a great opportunity in auctions. The company is actively pursuing this opportunity with the hire of a Head of Auctions  who started in March 2023.

Rawnet Rawnet is headquartered in Ascot  Berkshire  and was founded over 20 years ago by its current CEO Adam Smyth and has grown into a business comprising 70 digital marketing professionals. Rawnet’s core competency is in digital strategy and digital services design. Rawnet was acquired by Castelnau in 2021 and continues to balance the service provision for internal Castelnau group businesses alongside that of legacy and new external clients. Rawnet’s external client roster includes some top-tier UK and International businesses  and the company is enjoying increasing recurring revenue streams which reflects its increased value-add and strategic importance to its those customers. Showpiece The way people are collecting is changing  and Showpiece will tap into this dynamic by offering a digital collectable experience where customers have beneficial ownership of the underlying item. The first item made available was the One Cent Magenta stamp. In 2022  three further items were made available on the platform. A curation of only the most extraordinary items will differentiate the Showpiece offering. With Stanley Gibbons’ purchase of the world’s most valuable stamp  the British Guiana One Cent Magenta  Showpiece has access to an extraordinary seed item that can generate significant public interest. The Stanley Gibbons brand also adds credibility to the Showpiece product. Having been established in 2021  this year has primarily been about building for the future while also releasing three additional items onto the platform. This building of capability has revolved around bringing the majority of our tech development capability in house as well as strengthening our marketing and customer services capability. The rationale behind this being in preparation for more aggressive growth in the coming months and years. The primary driver of this being a planned increase in the number of items being made available on the platform. In addition  the plan involves further development of the model to incorporate a larger number of third-party items. In practice  growth has been slightly slower than we had hoped with the main barrier being a difficulty in sourcing the right types of items at values we have been happy with. Castelnau Group Ltd (“CGL”) owns an 80% equity stake in Showpiece Technologies Limited  the remaining 20% is owned by Stanley Gibbons Plc. CGL owns 63% of Stanley Gibbons Plc and Phoenix Asset Management in total own 80% of Stanley Gibbons Plc across numerous funds. CGL currently values the equity portion of its stake in Showpiece at cost or 8 000 shares at £1per share and the £2.7mn loan at par. The fair value of the investment we believe is the value of our total investment in the company to date  or £2.7million as of December 2022. Cambium 2022 experienced a strong rebound having been significantly impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic that saw countrywide lockdowns with only the return to more typical full-size weddings  that did not restrict number of guests attending  not happening till the end of June 2021. All brands now operate out of the one warehouse and whilst there were supplier issues because of Covid that impacted deliveries to couples  these have now been resolved and The Wedding Shop and Wedding Present Company are back to 5-star Trustpilot scores. For the whole year pledge revenue was up 60% on 2019. The post-COVID bulge in wedding activity has subsided and the Directors expect the industry to return to more normal levels. The business continues to be optimised with a new management structure and cost base. In June 2022 £16 million was raised in a Rights Issue that was used to repay the £8.0 million financing facility plus interest accrued with the Phoenix UK Fund as well as to secure investment for two other ventures. The first was the purchase of Hostology  an online portal for wedding venues. The second is for the development of a baby list offering named “Little List”. Little List soft launched in February 2023 A £5.5 million loan facility extension was made available in March 2023 by the Castelnau Group for development in the business and producing Rock My Wedding 3.0. Graham ShircorePartner  Phoenix Asset Management Partners Ltd.3 April 2023 Statement from the CIO of the Investment Manager Dear Shareholders  This report concludes our first full year (as a listed company) and coincides with the aforementioned bid for Dignity  which we deal with in some detail in the latest Castelnau Group quarterly report. For consistency and clarity  we have replicated the relevant section from the report below: “Buying control of Dignity plc is a game changer for Castelnau Group in so many ways. It brings together all the best of what Castelnau is about in a transaction that will change our scale and add considerably to upside value. The NAV of Castelnau Group fell 20% in 2022 (from 94p to 75p) despite the cheapness of the starting assets. That was caused by a fall in the share prices of our listed holdings and an adjustment in the valuation of our private holdings. Because the public market prices declined and interest rates rose  the discount rate used to value our private company holdings was increased by around 5%  e.g. where it was 15% it was increased to 20%. Intrinsic value did not decline. Using our estimates of intrinsic value  Castelnau Group shares are worth considerably more after the Dignity bid than before. We would like to be able to share those intrinsic value calculations with you  but as Castelnau is a bidder for Dignity  offering its shares as an alternative to cash  then we are not permitted to do that under the rules laid out by the Takeover Panel. We will do it when the bid process is over  as we do in Phoenix. The impact of this transaction will be to increase the proportion of the fund held in Dignity to over 60% and it will represent around 75% to 80% of the intrinsic value. Given the enormity of that  we will focus on Dignity in this report. Suggesting that we have the potential to transform your £1s into multiples of that  and do it in a fairly short time frame  3 to 5 years  is a bold and seemingly overconfident assertion that requires proper explanation. Even those who know the Dignity story well and understand the value potential will want to know how inside Castelnau that will translate into observable and realisable gains. We aim to cover all of that. The rules that we are constrained by in our communication with you right now (from the Takeover Panel regarding the bid and the FCA regarding the placement) stop us just laying out what we see those values being  but we will do our best within the rules to convey the significance of this to you. We are partially helped by using the presentation at the 2021 Dignity AGM by the CEO who at that time was Gary Channon. Gary is also the CIO of Phoenix. In that presentation he used a Phoenix style methodology to talk about the potential intrinsic value of Dignity should the strategy be successfully executed. This divergence in the current valuation versus the potential intrinsic value (as referred to above) came about because of a confluence of factors including delays in executing the strategy  staff shortages  a rise in input price inflation  especially employees and energy  and the slow pace of the capital restructuring work. Taken together  these put strains on Dignity’s current financial position which can be seen in its published results. That difference between share price and potential intrinsic value reflected the market’s scepticism about the likely success of the strategy and perhaps a concern that it would need more capital to get there. The value creating formula at Dignity though can be summarised in this way. The business has high operational gearing and so growth translates into profits at a high marginal level  meaning that modest growth causes big gains in profits. The best way to grow is to earn the right by being the best and drawing attention to that. Gaining customers starts with funeral plans which feed into funerals and growing funerals grows activity at the crematoria. Dignity is being positioned to earn and deliver that growth. Gaining control allows us to do a number of things which we believe change the probability of success very materially. Operating with control and partnering with Sir Peter Wood and his team allows us to speed up strategy execution and bring more resource to assist the Dignity executive team. There is a lot being changed at Dignity which would challenge the bandwidth of any executive team. We have a clear vision and a detailed plan for Dignity which  if successfully executed  increases the value into the range from that AGM presentation. Execution  i.e.  the ability to get things done  is an underappreciated differentiator in business. At Castelnau we use a system in all our businesses called OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) which John Doerr taught famously to Google and wrote about in his excellent book  Measure What Matters. He learned it at the foot of a true master of high-performance management  Andy Grove of Intel who is considered by some to be the best CEO of all time. He shared with Doerr what he considers to be the single most important lesson of his career. He said  “John  it almost doesn’t matter what you know…it’s execution that matters most.” The transformation of Dignity  from a group in terminal decline and losing share in all its activities  into the UK’s leading end of life business  growing share on the basis of merit by offering the best proposition to the communities it serves  is well underway. It is worth putting what has happened so far into perspective. A top-down hierarchical organisation arranged into divisional silos has been inverted  those silos abolished and rearranged into around 180 separate local businesses. Almost all of the most senior leadership from 2019 has left  around 300 middle management roles have been abolished and every one of those new local businesses has run a process to appoint a new business leader. Those business leaders are empowered to serve families and build successful funeral and crematoria businesses in their area. That process took longer than initially forecast but is now done and it is no surprise that it was disruptive. When your aim is to make a very significant change to an entrenched organisational culture  then it is thought best to start by dramatically smashing up what went before. We have certainly done that. At the same time  the company has laid out the Company Principles that define what the new culture will be. The work now is to teach  embed  train  recruit and retain for that new culture. The Company Principles focus the group on serving families  the ultimate customers of the group  and doing it in way that empowers those closest to them.” Read the rest of the report here: https://www.castelnaugroup.com/application/files/8516/7568/4497/Castelnau_Group_Ltd_Q4_2022.pdf Summary: We expect to see growing sales and improving profitability across all four of our core businesses in the coming years. They all serve large markets and have big opportunities to expand their businesses further. With all the leadership teams now in place  the focus of Castelnau can shift to a greater extent towards helping those teams plan and execute their growth strategies. Our two enabling businesses Rawnet and Ocula are also growing  both in terms of their impact on our portfolio businesses and with third party clients. 2022 was a formative year for Castelnau  including within our own team. A huge amount has been done but you may rightly conclude that not much seemed to happen in what really counts  which is growth in value at a per share level. We believe that we have put in place the conditions for that value to start coming through and  if successful  achieving a controlling interest in Dignity has the potential to be transformational. We will update you openly and honestly whatever path it takes but we have never been more excited about the future. We believe that we can continue to find businesses where we can add materially to their value by applying our resources and expertise. If we succeed  you will hold a portfolio of great companies compounding your value into the future  those currently in the portfolio being joined occasionally by new candidates provided that we have the bandwidth to handle them.

Profit or loss and other comprehensive income of the Subsidiary is recognised from the effective date of acquisition  or up to the effective date of disposal  as applicable. Dividend Policy The Group has no stated dividend target. The Group’s investment objective is one of capital growth and it is anticipated that returns for Shareholders will derive primarily from capital gains. The Group will target a Net Asset Value total return of 10-15% above the return on the FTSE All-Share Total Return Index per annum and a minimum absolute Net Asset Value total return of 20% per annum. Investors should note that the target returns noted above are targets only and not a profit forecast. There may be a number of factors that adversely affect the Company’s ability to achieve the target returns and there can be no assurance that the target will be met. Borrowing Policy There is no limit in the Articles on the level of gearing which the Group can employ. Whilst the Group does not currently expect to have long-term gearing as part of its strategy  any such gearing utilised would be expected to be below 50% of the Group’s gross asset value (including undrawn capital commitments)  in each case measured at the time of investment. The Board may  however  approve a higher level of gearing from time to time  in circumstances where the Investment Manager recommends it should do so on an opportunistic basis. Going Concern The Directors believe that  having considered the Group’s investment objective (see above)  financial risk management (see note 2 to the Financial Statements)  principal risks and in view of the Group’s holdings in cash and cash equivalents  the liquidity of investments and the income deriving from those investments  the Company has adequate financial resources and suitable management arrangements in place to continue as a going concern for at least twelve months from the date of approval of the Financial Statements. The Alternative Investment Fund Manager (“AIFM”) and Investment Manager Investment Manager The Investment Management Agreement with PAMP creates significant Shareholder alignment  as PAMP does not earn a management fee but earns a performance fee only  which is paid in shares and not in cash. The performance fee period is three years and is equal to one-third of the relative outperformance to the FTSE All share Total Return Index. The Board considers that the interests of Shareholders  as a whole  are best served by the ongoing appointment of the Investment Manager to achieve the Company’s investment objectives. Alternative Investment Fund Manager (“AIFM”) PAMP has been investing in UK listed equities for 24 years using a ""value investing"" approach to buy high-quality businesses at attractive prices. PAMP has delivered excellent long-term investment returns since being set up by Gary Channon in 1998. PAMP also manage the Aurora Investment Trust Plc and the Huginn Fund. Shareholders can view the historic track record of the Phoenix UK Fund here: https://www.phoenixassetmanagement.com/performance/ PAMP’s investment process aims to identify great businesses and management through intensive primary research. PAMP is known for the depth of its research which can often last many years before making an investment. Once an investment is made  the investment team maintains this intensive approach to research by closely monitoring the investments. PAMP has an investment philosophy and approach that is inspired and influenced by some of the great investors such as Warren Buffett  Phil Fisher  Charlie Munger and John Maynard Keynes. These philosophies have been built into a ""Phoenix approach""  which PAMP has continuously refined using experience of application and analysis and learning. This has turned the philosophical approach into a proprietary technical approach which have been applied to the investments managed by PAMP and have helped to deliver long term outperformance. This philosophy and approach are the bedrock for the approach which Castelnau also takes  however this has been further developed in order to be more applicable to entities which we control or are able to give greater assistance to. More information about this is included in our quarterly investor reports which can be found here: https://www.castelnaugroup.com/investor-relations/reports-factsheets The Investment Management Agreement dated 23 September 2021 between the Company and the Investment Manager  pursuant to which the Investment Manager is appointed to act as the Company’s alternative investment fund manager for the purposes of the UK AIFM Regime  and accordingly the Investment Manager is responsible for providing portfolio management and risk management services to the Company  subject to the overall control and supervisions of the Directors. The Investment Manager  in its capacity as the Company’s alternative investment fund manager  will also make the relevant notifications for the marketing of the Shares in the United Kingdom and elsewhere (if required). Shareholders may be interested in reading the historic track record of the Phoenix UK Fund since inception  which is an Appendix at the back of the Annual Report and Audited Consolidated Financial Statements. PAMP’s investment process aims to identify great businesses and management through intensive primary research. PAMP is known for the depth of its research which can often last many years before making an investment. Once an investment is made  the investment team maintains this intensive approach to research through an ongoing  rigorous monitoring programme. Building on PAMP’s experience of investing in private companies and companies where they have control or influence  and in particularly in respect of what is now The Cambium Group  the Investment Manager has built a ""Castelnau Toolbox""  essentially a way of standardising PAMP’s critical knowledge and techniques that can be applied to a specific type of investee company  which can be assessed and improved through application over time. Control of the Level of Ongoing Charges The Board monitors the Group’s operating costs carefully. Based on the Group’s average net assets for the year ended 31 December 2022  the Group’s ongoing charges figure calculated in accordance with the Association of Investment Companies (AIC) methodology was 0.52% (2021: 0.32%). The movement is down to a new licencing agreement between the Company and Ocula Technologies. For additional information on this agreement  refer to note 15 to the Financial Statements. As the size of the Group grows  the Board will manage expenses with the intention of keeping costs down and reducing the ongoing charge ratio accordingly. Custodian and Depositary Custody and Depositary services are provided by Northern Trust (Guernsey) Limited (the “Depositary”). The Depositary was appointed on 18 October 2021. The terms of the Depositary agreement allow the Depositary to receive professional fees for services rendered. The Depositary agreement includes custodian duties. For additional information  refer to note 14 to the Financial Statements. Directors The Directors of the Group during the year and at the date of this Report are set out in the Company Information section. Directors' and Other Interests The Directors of the Group held the following Ordinary Shares beneficially: 31 December 2022 31 December 2022 31 December 2021 31 December 2021 Number of ordinary shares % of issued share capital Number of ordinary shares % of issued share capital Joanne Peacegood 10 000 0.01% 10 000 0.01% Andrew Whittaker 40 000 0.02% 40 000 0.02% Joanna Duquemin Nicolle 75 000 0.04% 75 000 0.04% David Stevenson - - - - Lorraine Smyth* - - - - Graham Shircore** - - - - * Resigned on 15 December 2022. ** Appointed on 15 December 2022. Corporate Governance The Board is committed to high standards of corporate governance and has implemented a framework for corporate governance which it considers to be appropriate for an investment company in order to comply with the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “UK Code”). The Company is also required to comply with the Code of Corporate Governance (the “GFSC Code”) issued by the Guernsey Financial Services Commission. This Corporate Governance Statement  together with the Going Concern Statement  Viability Statement and the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities  indicates how the Company has complied with the principles of good governance of the UK Code and its requirements on Internal Control. The Group is a member of the AIC and by complying with the AIC Code of Corporate Governance (the “AIC Code”) is deemed to comply with both the UK Code and the GFSC Code. The Board has considered the principles and recommendations of the AIC Code  and considers that reporting against these will provide better information to Shareholders. To ensure ongoing compliance with these principles  the Board reviews a report from the Corporate Secretary at each quarterly meeting  identifying how the Group is in compliance and identifying any changes that might be necessary. The AIC Code is available on the AIC’s website  www.theaic.co.uk. The UK Code is available in the Financial Reporting Council’s website  www.frc.org.uk. Since listing on the SFS (Specialist Fund Segment) of the London Stock Exchange’s Main Market on 18 October 2021  the Group has complied with the recommendations of the AIC Code and thus the relevant provisions of the UK Code  except as set out below. The UK Code includes provisions relating to: • The role of the Chief Executive; • Executive Directors’ remuneration; • Annually assessing the need for an internal audit function; and • Senior Independent Director. It is acknowledged in the UK Corporate Governance Code that some of its provisions may not be relevant to externally managed investment companies (such as the Group). The Board does not consider that the above provisions are relevant to the Group. The Group will therefore not comply with these provisions. Whilst the Group will seek to comply with the AIC Code as far as practicable  it is likely that it will not be able to so comply with all of the AIC Code requirements. In particular  in relation to the Director appointed by the holder of the B Share  this Director will be appointed by the Investment Manager and therefore will not be entirely independent of the Investment Manager. Further  such Director will not be subject to annual re-election. In addition  the holder of the B Share has the power to ensure that no Directors are removed or appointed without its consent. The GFSC’s Finance Sector Code of Corporate Governance (the “Code”) applies to the Group. The GFSC has stated in the Code that companies which report against the UK Corporate Governance Code or the AIC Code are deemed to meet the requirements of the Code  and need take no further action. Accordingly  as the Group will report against the AIC Code  it will be deemed to meet the requirements of the Code. Role  Composition and Independence of the Board The Board is the Group’s governing body and has overall responsibility for maximising the Group’s success by directing and supervising the affairs of the business and meeting the appropriate interests of Shareholders and relevant stakeholders  while enhancing the value of the Group and also ensuring protection of investors. A summary of the Board’s responsibilities is as follows: • statutory obligations and public disclosure; • strategic matters and financial reporting; • risk assessment and management including reporting compliance  governance  monitoring and control; and • other matters having a material effect on the Group. The Board’s responsibilities for the Annual Report and Audited Consolidated Financial Statements are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities. Biographies for all the Directors can be found in the Board Members section. The Board consists of five non-executive Directors all of whom have diverse skillsets and experience. Three of the five directors are considered to be independent of the Investment Manager and as prescribed by the Listing Rules. The Board does not consider it appropriate to appoint a Senior Independent Director because the majority of the Directors are deemed to be independent of the Group. The Board considers that it has the appropriate balance of diverse skills and experience  independence and knowledge of the Group and the wider sector  to enable it to discharge its duties and responsibilities effectively and that no individual or group of individuals dominates decision making. The Chair is responsible for leadership of the Board and ensuring its effectiveness. The Chair is Joanne Peacegood. The Chair of the Board must be  and is considered to be  independent for the purposes of Chapter 15 of the Listing Rules. The Board needs to ensure that the Annual Report and Audited Consolidated Financial Statements  taken as a whole  is fair  balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for Shareholders to assess the Group’s position and performance  business model and strategy. In seeking to achieve this  the Directors have set out the Group’s investment objective and policy and have explained how the Board and its delegated Committees operate and how the Directors review the risk environment within which the Group operates and sets appropriate risk controls. Furthermore  throughout the Annual Report and Audited Consolidated Financial Statements  the Board has sought to provide further information to enable Shareholders to have a fair  balanced and understandable view. The Board has contractually delegated responsibility for the management of its investment portfolio  the arrangement of custodial and depositary services and the provision of administration  accounting  registrar and company secretarial services including the independent calculation of the Group’s NAV and the production of the Annual Report and Audited Consolidated Financial Statements which are independently audited. The Board is responsible for the appointment and monitoring of all service providers to the Group. The Directors are kept fully informed of investment and financial controls and other matters by all services providers that are relevant to the business of the Group and should be brought to the attention of the Directors.The Nominations Committee regularly reviews the structure  size  composition (including the skills  knowledge  experience and diversity) of the Board as a whole and makes recommendations to the Board with regard to any changes. The Board has a breadth of experience relevant to the Group and the Directors believe that any changes to the Board’s composition can be managed without undue disruption. With any new director appointment to the Board  consideration will be given as to what induction process is appropriate. Directors’ Attendance at Meetings The Board holds quarterly Board meetings to discuss matters including: portfolio performance  strategy  dividend policy  structure  finance  corporate governance  marketing  risk management  liquidity  compliance  asset allocation and gearing  contracts and Group performance. The quarterly Board meetings are the principal source of regular information for the Board enabling it to determine policy and to monitor performance  compliance and controls but these meetings are also supplemented by communication and discussions throughout the year. A representative from each of the Investment Manager  AIFM  Administrator and Corporate Broker attends each Board meeting either in person or by telephone thus enabling the Board to fully discuss and review the Group’s operation and performance. Each Director has direct access to the Portfolio Manager and Company Secretary and may  at the expense of the Group  seek independent professional advice on any matter. Both appointment and removal of these parties is to be agreed by the Board as a whole. The Audit Committee now meets five times a year  the Management Engagement Committee (“MEC”) and Remuneration and Nomination Committee meet at least once a year. In addition  adhoc meetings of the Board to review specific items between the regular scheduled quarterly meetings can be arranged. Between formal meetings  there is regular contact with the Portfolio Manager  AIFM  Administrator  Custodian and Depositary and the Corporate Broker. Although some of the Directors hold other listed Board positions  none of these is for a trading company and the Board is satisfied that they have sufficient time commitment to carry out their duties for the Group as evidenced by their attendance at the Board and Audit Committee meetings during the year. At the Board meetings  the Directors review the management of the Group’s assets and liabilities and all other significant matters so as to ensure that the Directors maintain overall control and supervision of the Group’s affairs. Appointment and Retirement of Directors Subject to the Companies Law and the Articles  the Directors shall have power at any time  and from time to time  without sanction of the Group in general meeting but subject to receiving the written consent of the holder of the B Share  to appoint any person to be a Director  either to fill a casual vacancy or as an additional Director. Any Director so appointed shall hold office only until the next following annual general meeting and shall then be eligible for re-appointment. Subject to the Companies Law and the Articles  the Group may by ordinary resolution appoint any person as a Director; and remove any person from office as a Director and there shall be no requirement for the appointment or removal of two or more Directors to be considered separately. A Director may resign from office as a Director by giving notice in writing to that effect to the Group. There is no age limit at which a Director is required to retire. At each annual general meeting of the Group  each Director  other than the Director appointed by the holder of the B Share pursuant to the Articles  shall retire from office and each Director may offer themselves for election or re-election by the Shareholders. Board Performance and Training On appointment to the Board  Directors will be offered relevant training and induction. Training is an ongoing matter as is discussion on the overall strategy of the Group. The Board will undertake an annual Board Evaluation of performance. This exercise was completed in February 2022 and in March 2023. The results of the evaluation were satisfactory with no issues identified but future evaluations will be more meaningful as it is very early in the Group’s life to comment meaningfully.On appointment to the Board  each Director considered the expected time needed to discharge their responsibilities effectively. The Directors confirmed that each had sufficient time to allocate and would inform the Board of any subsequent changes. In accordance with the AIC Code  if and when any Director  including the Chair  has been in office (or upon re-election would at the end of that term  be in office) for more than nine years  the Board will consider whether there is a risk that such Director might reasonably be deemed to have lost independence through such long service. In respect of the Criminal Finances Act 2017 which has introduced a new corporate criminal offence (“CCO”) of ‘failing to take reasonable steps to prevent the facilitation of tax evasion’  the Board confirms that they are committed to zero tolerance towards the criminal facilitation of tax evasion. Board Diversity When appointing new Directors and reviewing the Board composition  the Board considers  amongst other factors  diversity  balance of skills  knowledge  gender  social and ethnic background and experience. The Board  however  does not consider it appropriate to establish targets or quotas in this regard. The Board comprises diverse skillset and knowledge that is appropriate for an entity of this nature. Board Committees and their Activities Terms of Reference All Terms of Reference of the Board’s Committees are available from the Administrator upon request. Management Engagement Committee In accordance with the AIC Code  the Group has established a Management Engagement Committee which is chaired by Joanna Duquemin Nicolle and includes Andrew Whittaker  Joanne Peacegood and David Stevenson. The Management Engagement Committee will meet at least once a year or more often if required. Its principal duties will be to consider the terms of appointment of the Investment Manager and other service providers and it will annually review those appointments and the terms of engagement. Audit Committee The Group’s Audit Committee is chaired by Andrew Whittaker and includes Joanna Duquemin Nicolle and Joanne Peacegood. The Audit Committee will meet at least five times a year. The Board considers that the members of the Audit Committee have the requisite skills and sector experience to fulfil the responsibilities of the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee will examine the effectiveness of the Group’s control systems and amongst other items  will review the half-yearly and annual reports and also request certain information from the Investment Manager and the Administrator. It will also review the scope  results  cost effectiveness  independence and objectivity of the external Auditor. Further details on the Audit Committee can be found in the Audit Committee Report. Remuneration Committee The Group’s Remuneration Committee consists of all of the Directors and is chaired by Joanne Peacegood. The Remuneration Committee will meet at least twice a year or more often if required. The Remuneration Committee’s main functions include: agreeing the policy for the remuneration of the Directors and reviewing any proposed changes to the policy; reviewing and considering ad hoc payment to the Directors in relation to duties undertaken over and above normal business; and appointing independent professional remuneration advice. Nomination Committee The Group’s Nomination Committee consists of all of the Directors and is chaired by Andrew Whittaker. The Nomination Committee will meet at least once a year or more often if required. Its principal duties will be to advise the Board on succession planning bearing in mind the balance of skills  knowledge and experience existing on the Board and will make recommendations to the Board in this regard. The Nomination Committee advises the Board on its balance of relevant skills  experience  gender  race  ages and length of service of the Directors serving on the Board. All appointments to the Board will be made in a formal and transparent manner. For each Director  the tables below set out the number of Board and Committee meetings they were entitled to attend during the year ended 31 December 2022 and the number of such meetings attended by each Director.

Strategy The Group will follow a high conviction investment strategy. The expertise and processes developed by the Investment Manager can be applied to all parts of the capital structure of a business  both private and publicly quoted. These positions could be represented by a minority stake  a control position combined with operational involvement  full ownership of a company  a joint venture  a loan or convertible instrument  a short position or any other instrument which allows the Group to access value. Internal Controls The Board is ultimately responsible for establishing and maintaining the Group’s system of internal financial and operating control and for maintaining and reviewing its effectiveness. The Group’s risk matrix continues to be the core element of the Group’s risk management process in establishing the Group’s system of internal financial and reporting control. The risk matrix is prepared and maintained by the Board which initially identifies the risks facing the Group and then collectively assesses the likelihood of each risk  the impact of those risks and the strength of the controls operating over each risk. The system of internal financial and operating control is designed to manage rather than to eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and by their nature can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against misstatement and loss. These controls aim to ensure that assets of the Group are safeguarded  proper accounting records are maintained and the financial information for publication is reliable. The Board confirms that there is an ongoing process for identifying  evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the Group. This process has been in place for the year under review and up to the date of approval of this Annual Report and Audited Consolidated Financial Statements. It has been reviewed by the Board and is in accordance with the AIC Code. The AIC Code requires Directors to conduct at least annually a review of the Group’s system of internal financial and operating control  covering all controls  including financial  operational  compliance and risk management. The Board has evaluated the systems of internal controls of the Group. In particular  it has prepared a process for identifying and evaluating the significant risks affecting the Group and the policies by which these risks are managed. The Board also considers whether the appointment of an internal auditor is required and has determined that there is no requirement for a direct internal audit function. The Board has delegated the day-to-day responsibilities for the management of the Group’s investment portfolio  the provision of custodial and depositary services and administration  accounting  registrar and company secretarial functions including the independent calculation of the Group’s NAV and the production of the Annual Report and Audited Consolidated Financial Statements which are independently audited. Formal contractual agreements have been put in place between the Group and providers of these services. Even though the Board has delegated responsibility for these functions  it retains accountability for these functions and is responsible for the systems of internal control. At each quarterly Board meeting  compliance reports are provided by the Administrator  Company Secretary  Portfolio Manager  AIFM and Depositary. The Board also receives confirmation from the Administrator of its accreditation under its controls report. Procedure for Identifying Risks The procedures in place to identify emerging or principal risks are described below. The Audit Committee regularly reviews the Group’s risk matrix  focusing on ensuring that the appropriate controls are in place to mitigate each risk. A system has been established to identify emerging risks as they occur as detailed below. The experience and knowledge of the Audit Committee and Board is invaluable to these discussions  as is advice received from the Board’s service providers  specifically the Investment Manager who is responsible for all portfolio management services. The market and operational risks were discussed by the Board  with updates on operational resilience received from the Investment Manager  Administrator and other key service providers. The following is a description of the role each service provider plays in the identification of emerging risks. I. Investment Manager: the Investment Manager advises the Board at each meeting on world markets  stock market trends  information on stock specific matters as well as regulatory  political and economic changes likely to impact the Group’s portfolio; II. Distributor and Broker: provides advice periodically specific to the Board on the Group’s share register  sector  competitors and the investment company market; III. Company Secretary and Accounting Advisor: briefs the Board on forthcoming legislation or regulatory changes that might impact the Group; and IV. AIC: The Group is a member of the AIC  which provides regular technical updates as well as drawing members’ attention to forthcoming industry and regulatory issues. Procedure for Oversight of Risks Audit Committee: The risk matrix is kept under review. This includes a review of the risk procedures and controls in place at the key service providers to ensure that emerging (as well as known) risks are adequately identified and – so far as practicable – mitigated. Experienced Non-Executive Directors on the Committee  each bringing external knowledge of the investment trust (and financial services generally) marketplace  trends  threats etc. as well as macro/strategic insight. Principal Risks and Uncertainties The principal risks faced by the Group  together with the approach taken by the Board towards them  have been summarised below. Valuation of investments The Group’s investments had a total value of £132 645 371 as at 31 December 2022 (31 December 2021: £129 979 441). The portfolio represents a substantial portion of net assets of the Group. As such  this is the largest factor in relation to the consideration of the Financial Statements. These investments are valued in accordance with the Accounting Policies set out in note 2 and note 3 to the Financial Statements. The risks associated with valuation of investments are managed by the Investment Manager and reviewed by the Board. The Board considered the valuation of the investments held by the Group as at 31 December 2022 to be reasonable based on information provided by the Investment Manager  underlying portfolio companies  AIFM  Administrator  Custodian and Depositary on their processes for the valuation of these investments. The Board reviewed the valuations policy and PAMP went through the valuation process/techniques with the Board around private assets investments. There has been no change to the valuation policy and the process remains the same which has also been confirmed with the Board. The Board are satisfied with the approach and the valuation policy and processes. The Board receives the monthly NAV as well as quarterly detailed updates on the portfolio which include changes to the valuations. The Board is updated when there is/or potential to be significant changes in valuation. As part of the annual audit process and the Board signing off on the annual financial statements  the Board receives the valuations packs and also the third-party (Kroll) reports. The Board scrutinises the valuations / reports and ensures they are satisfied prior to sign off. The Board also asks questions regularly (including during quarterly board meetings  or ad hoc meetings) to understand performance and the impact on valuation. The Board has access to detailed valuation reports as and when requested. Market risk As a result of investments in publicly traded Portfolio Companies  the Group will be exposed to equity securities price risk. The market value of the Group’s holdings in publicly traded Portfolio Companies could be affected by a number of factors  including  but not limited to: a change in sentiment in the market regarding such companies; the market’s appetite for specific business sectors; and the financial or operational performance of the publicly traded Portfolio Companies which may be driven by  amongst other things  the cyclicality of some of the sectors in which some or all of the publicly traded Portfolio Companies operate. Equity prices and returns from investing in equity markets are sensitive to various factors  including but not limited to: expectations of future dividends and profits; economic growth; exchange rates; interest rates; and inflation. The value of any investment in equity markets is therefore volatile and it is possible  even when an investment has been held for a long time  that an investor may not get back the sum invested. Any adverse effect on the value of any equities in which the Group invests from time to time could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s financial condition  business  prospects and results of operations and  consequently  the Net Asset Value and/or the market price of the Shares. The Board receives a quarterly update  or more frequently as required  from the Investment Manager regarding investment performance. Liquidity risk Investments made by the Group may be illiquid and this may result in delays/shortfall of expected cash flows to the Group. Investments in private assets (including private Portfolio Companies) are highly illiquid and have no public market. There may not be a secondary market for interests in private assets. Such illiquidity may affect the Group’s ability to vary its portfolio or dispose of  or liquidate part of  its portfolio  in a timely fashion (or at all) and at satisfactory prices in response to changes in economic or other conditions. If the Group were required to dispose of or liquidate an investment on unsatisfactory terms  it may realise less than the value at which the investment was previously recorded  which could result in a decrease in Net Asset Value. The performance of investments in private assets can also be volatile because those assets may have limited product lines  markets or financial reserves  or be more susceptible to major economic setbacks or downturns. Private assets may be exposed to a variety of business risks including  but not limited to: competition from larger  more established firms; advancement of incumbent services and technologies; and the resistance of the market towards new companies  services or technologies. The crystallisation of any of these risks or a combination of these risks may have a material adverse effect on the development and value of a Portfolio Company and  consequently  on the portfolio and the Group’s financial condition  results of operations and prospects  with a consequential adverse effect on the Net Asset Value and/or the market price of the Shares. Furthermore  repeated failures by Portfolio Companies to achieve success may adversely affect the reputation of the Group or Investment Manager  which may make it more challenging for the Group and the Investment Manager to identify and exploit new opportunities and for other Portfolio Companies to raise additional capital  which may therefore have a material adverse effect on the portfolio and the Group’s financial condition  results of operations and prospects  with a consequential adverse effect on the Net Asset Value and/or the market price of the Shares. The Board receives a quarterly update  or more frequently as required  from the Investment Manager regarding investment performance. Credit risk Counterparties such as financial institutions may not meet their obligations regarding foreign currency and cash balances. The Board ensures that counterparties have an acceptable long and short term credit rating. Concentration risk The Group expects to hold a concentrated portfolio of investments and the Group will not seek to reduce concentration risk through diversification. The opportunity set will dictate the number of holdings and the weighting of investments in the Portfolio. The investments with the best return profiles will receive the largest weightings. The Group will therefore have no set diversification policies. Other Risks and Uncertainties Cyber risk The Board ensures they have a sufficient understanding of cyber risk to enable them to manage any potential unauthorised access into systems and identifying passwords or deleting data. The Board discusses cyber risks at the quarterly board meeting and also ensures they are continuing to keep themselves up to date on the risks through attending professional seminars on the topic  following good password practices and vigilance to any suspicious links or attachments. The Group is exposed to the cyber risks of its third-party service providers. The Audit Committee received the internal controls reports of the relevant service providers  where available and was able to satisfy itself that adequate controls and procedures were in place to limit the impact to the Group’s operations. Operational risk The Group is exposed to the operational and cyber risks of its third-party service providers and considered the risk and consequences in the event that these systems failed during the year. The Investment Manager  Registrar  Depositary  Administrator and Company Secretary each have comprehensive business continuity plans which facilitate continued operation of the business in the event of a service disruption or major disruption. The Audit Committee received the internal controls reports of the relevant service providers  where available and was able to satisfy itself that adequate controls and procedures were in place to limit the impact to the Group’s operations  particularly with regard to a financial loss. The performance of service providers is reviewed annually via its Remuneration and Management Engagement Committee. Each service provider’s contract defines the duties and responsibilities of each and has safeguards in place including provisions for the termination of each agreement in the event of a breach or under certain circumstances. Each agreement also allows for the Board to terminate subject to a stated notice period. At the Management Engagement Committee on 15 December 2022  the Board undertook a thorough review of each service provider and agreed that their continued appointment remained appropriate and in the Group’s long term interest. The Board’s next review will be at the next annual Management Engagement Committee meeting. Regulatory risk Poor governance  compliance or administration  including particularly the risk of loss of investment trust status and the impact this may have on the Group was considered by the Board. Having been provided with assurance from each of the key service providers during the year ended 31 December 2022  the Board was satisfied that no such breach had occurred. The Board’s next review will be at the next annual Management Engagement Committee meeting. Geopolitical risk Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was a new emerging risk to the global economy. The resulting imposition of international sanctions on Russia have had a wider global effect on the supply and prices of certain commodities and consequently on inflation and general economic growth of the global economy and has delayed the global economic recovery from COVID-19. Environmental  Social and Governance (“ESG”) matters The Board recognises the importance of Environmental  Social and Governance (“ESG”) factors in the investment management industry and the wider economy as a whole. It is the view of the Board that direct environmental and social impact of the Group is limited and that ESG considerations are most applicable in respect of the asset allocation decisions made for its portfolio. The Group has appointed the Investment Manager to advise it in relation to all aspects relevant to the Investment Portfolio. The Investment Manager has a formal ESG framework which incorporates ESG factors into its investment process. The Board receives regular updates from the Investment Manager on its ESG processes and assesses their suitability for the Group. ESG factors are assessed by the Investment Manager for every transaction as part of their investment process. Climate risks are incorporated in the ESG analysis under environmental factors. The Group has entered into contractual arrangements with a network of third parties (the “Service Providers”) who provide services to it. The Board  through the Management Engagement Committee  undertakes annual due diligence on  and ongoing monitoring of  all such Service Providers including obtaining a confirmation that each such Service Provider complies with relevant laws regulations and good practice and has ESG policies in place. Viability Statement Under the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “UK Code”) and the AIC Code of Corporate Governance (the “AIC Code”)  the Board is required to produce a “Viability statement” which considers the Group’s current position and principal risks and uncertainties combined with an assessment of the prospects of the Group in order to be able to state that they have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation over the period of their assessment. The Board considers that five years is an appropriate period to assess the viability of the Group. Whilst the Board has no reason to believe that the Group will not be viable for a longer period  it has chosen this period given the uncertainty of the investment world and the strategy period. In selecting this period  the Board considered the environment within which the Group operates and the risks associated with the Group. The Group’s prospects are driven by its business model and strategy. The Group’s investment objective is to compound Shareholder’s capital at a higher rate of return than the FTSE All Share Total Return Index over the long term. The Group will target a Net Asset Value total return of 10-15% above the return on the FTSE All Share Total Return Index per annum and a minimum absolute Net Asset Value total return of 20% per annum. The Board confirms that they have performed a robust assessment of the principal and emerging risks facing the Group and the Board’s assessment of the Group over the five year period has been made with reference to the Group’s current strategy  position and prospects and the Board’s risk appetite having considered each of the Group’s Principal Risks and Uncertainties summarised above. The Board has also considered the Group’s cash flows and income flows. The Group has no stated dividend target. Key assumptions considered by the Board in relation to the viability of the Group are as follows and these are stressed in terms of liquidity of the portfolio: (i) investments are in line with the investment objective and investment policy as set out in the Group's prospectus; and (ii) the Group has the ability to meet running costs and standing expenses. The Board has a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment. The Board having considered the analysis above  have a reasonable expectation that the Group will remain viable over the five year period to 31 December 2027.

The activities delegated  service levels and other related reports to the activities of each service provider (such as their own approach to such matters as cyber risk and assessment of climate change risk to operations) are closely monitored  where and as appropriate by the Board and they are required to report to the Board at set intervals. Monitoring of key decisions and the outcome of those decisions The Board meets at least quarterly and at such other times as deemed appropriate.

SaaS Remote Access is designed for organizations - across all sectors and in particular the industrial one - that want to provide digital access to their IT infrastructure to external providers through simplified management  while benefiting from the highest level of cybersecurity offered by a PAM leader recognized by Gartner.To carry out their business  organizations rely on external service providers who need to connect to their IT infrastructure (whether traditional or industrial). These can be remote maintainers  supply chain vendors  service providers  external consultants  etc.The problem for organizations is that these external stakeholders are numerous and can change constantly. In addition  the frequency and duration of their intervention vary according to the needs of the business and their requirements. This is why visualizing  managing  and securing their access becomes a real headache for IT teams. It is indeed vital for organizations to know who has access to what  from where  and why  as well as to manage access permissions. This is the only way to detect and stop any attempt at identity theft by a hacker  internal malice  or negligence  and thus protect data. The fact is that the cost of a cyberattack increases by an average of $370 000 if a third party is involved. Moreover  by implementing traceability through a security and digital access management solution  organizations also ensure regulatory compliance with current cybersecurity standards.Traditionally  in an attempt to manage external stakeholder access  the IT team will implement VPN technology  a secure ""tunnel"" between the external stakeholder's device and the organization's IT infrastructure. Except that  in reality  VPN vulnerabilities regularly make news headlines. On the other hand  implementing VPNs is a cumbersome and expensive process: each stakeholder must be referenced in Active Directory  the Microsoft software used by almost all organizations  which allows permissions to be managed and access to IT resources (data  servers  applications  software  etc.) to be controlled. And this technology does not meet the regulatory requirements either.The Answer: SaaS Remote AccessTo optimize the management of external service provider access  IT teams should turn to innovative solutions such as SaaS Remote Access.WALLIX PAM4ALL is a unified privilege management solution. It combines all WALLIX technologies: multi-factor authentication (MFA)  remote access management  session management  password management  and least privilege management. The solution secures all access to the IT infrastructure  ensuring data protection  detection  and resistance to cyberattacks and business continuity. It also ensures compliance with cybersecurity regulations.SaaS Remote Access is WALLIX PAM4ALL's ""remote access management"" technology now available as a service. It has been developed especially for the access management of external providers.This SaaS version of the WALLIX remote access management technology is also available in WALLIX PAM4OT  a packaged offer based on WALLIX PAM4ALL  dedicated to industrial companies and those that own industrial equipment (like hospitals with scanners  etc.).The advantages of subscribing to this functionality in SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) mode are:Ease of Deployment and UseThanks to SaaS mode  there is no need to install a new solution to replace VPNs; an Internet connection is all that is needed to access SaaS Remote Access. This allows better accessibility  flexibility  and cost reduction. In addition  thanks to its user-friendly interface  it is quick and easy for companies to register their external service providers and configure their access rights to authorized resources. This frees the IT team from these actions and allows them to focus on more value-added tasks.End-to-end SecurityThe digital identities and passwords of external stakeholders are no longer integrated into the organization's Active Directory but are managed and secured in SaaS Remote Access. This drastically reduces cyber risk  since the more digital identities in the Active Directory  the greater the chance of a hacker stealing them and then accessing all the resources of the person whose identity has been stolen. This also allows the organization to have an IT hygiene that follows cybersecurity and traceability standards  enabling cybersecurity by design.Full Visibility of External Remote AccessWith SaaS Remote Access  organizations regain control of external remote access. Companies create access for their external providers in real time for a defined period and are automatically removed once the task is completed. External providers connect to the organization's IT infrastructure through the SaaS Remote Access web portal and every action they take is monitored  providing full visibility and transparency.""With this remote access management for suppliers  we are both meeting the security challenges of IT teams and promoting the digital transformation of companies. We also give autonomy to business teams and put the digital experience at the heart of our solution: speed of access creation  fluidity of interactions with suppliers  and operational efficiency for all business and IT teams. Interacting with suppliers and maintaining a line of defense for digital access becomes extremely easy and cost-effective with our solution. The launch of this service for securing external access to IT and industrial infrastructures is only the first phase of WALLIX's SaaS strategy "" explains Edwige Brossard  Product & Marketing Director at WALLIX.www.wallix.com | info@wallix.comLogo - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1801456/3815089/Wallix_Logo.jpgView original content:https://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/wallix-launches-saas-remote-access-to-facilitate-digital-access-for-external-providers-in-an-agile-and-secure-way-301775171.html",neutral,0.24,0.76,0.0,mixed,0.24,0.07,0.69,True,English,"['SaaS Remote Access', 'digital access', 'external providers', 'secure way', 'WALLIX', 'agile', 'WALLIX remote access management technology', 'unified privilege management solution', 'European cybersecurity software publisher', 'remote access management"" technology', 'WALLIX PAM4ALL unified solution', 'external service provider access', 'digital access management solution', 'supply chain vendors', 'SaaS Remote Access', 'current cybersecurity standards', 'WALLIX PAM4OT package', 'external service providers', 'external stakeholder access', 'VPN technology', 'remote maintainers', 'new solution', 'external providers', 'simplified management', 'session management', 'password management', 'access rights', 'external consultants', 'external stakeholders', 'SaaS version', 'digital identities', 'WALLIX technologies', 'Microsoft software', 'access permissions', 'cybersecurity regulations', 'SaaS mode', 'IT infrastructure', 'highest level', 'PAM leader', 'Identity Solutions', 'real headache', 'IT teams', 'identity theft', 'internal malice', 'third party', 'secure ""tunnel', 'VPN vulnerabilities', 'news headlines', 'other hand', 'expensive process', 'Active Directory', 'IT resources', 'The Answer', 'innovative solutions', 'multi-factor authentication', 'Internet connection', 'user-friendly interface', 'authorized resources', 'value-added tasks', 'industrial one', 'industrial equipment', 'regulatory compliance', 'regulatory requirements', 'cost reduction', 'end Security', 'data protection', 'business continuity', 'industrial companies', 'activities', 'organizations', 'sectors', 'industry', 'order', 'Gartner', 'PARIS', 'April', 'PRNewswire', 'Euronext', 'expert', 'problem', 'addition', 'frequency', 'duration', 'intervention', 'needs', 'way', 'attempt', 'hacker', 'negligence', 'cyberattack', 'average', 'traceability', 'device', 'reality', 'VPNs', 'cumbersome', 'servers', 'applications', 'MFA', 'least', 'detection', 'resistance', 'offer', 'hospitals', 'scanners', 'advantages', 'functionality', 'Ease', 'Deployment', 'accessibility', 'flexibility', 'actions', 'passwords']",2023-04-05,2023-04-05,news.webindia123.com

Euronext has completed the migration of Borsa Italiana’s equities and ETF businesses to its ...,Euronext has completed the migration of Borsa Italiana’s equities and ETF businesses to its proprietary trading platform  Optiq  removing the need to pay LSEG for the use of its technology.The exchange acquired Borsa Italiana from the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) in April 2021 for €4.4 billion as part of LSEG’s takeover of Refinitiv. With the migration onto Optiq  completed on 27 March  Euronext claims the platform is now handling a quarter of all European equity trading.Euronext chief executive Stephane Boujnah said the move was a “key milestone in building the backbone of the Capital Markets Union”.In a statement  the exchange confirmed this first phase paved the way for the migration of its Borsa Italiana fixed income businesses in the fourth quarter followed by derivatives and commodities.European internalisationThe move comes as part of Euronext’s wider plans to centralise and internalise its operations within the EU to support the Capital Markets Union (CMU). As part of the plans  the exchange also migrated its data centre in June last year from Basildon in the UK to Bergamo in Italy.At the end of this year  Euronext is also set to begin migrating its clearing operations away from LSEG’s LCH and over to the Bloc using its internal clearing house – Euronext Clearing  formerly CC&G – also acquired through the Borsa Italiana deal. The exchange moved to break off its 10-year deal – originally due to expire in 2027 – with LCH SA in November 2021 after announcing its plans to move its clearing operations to Italy.More recently in January  the exchange operator confirmed it was set to pay €36 million to LSEG’s clearing house LCH SA in exchange for the early termination of its derivatives clearing agreement.Following the agreement  Euronext intends to migrate the clearing business of its cash equities markets by the end of this year and its listed derivatives and commodities markets across Amsterdam  Brussels  Lisbon  Oslo Børs and Paris from LCH SA to Euronext Clearing by the third quarter of 2024.
