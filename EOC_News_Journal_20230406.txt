Furthermore  the board of directors proposes an amendment to the limits on number of shares set out in § 5 in the articles of association to be not less than 230 000 000 and not more than 920 000 000 shares.The resolution is conditioned by the shareholders’ resolution to reduce the share capital as set out in item 8 below.Resolution regarding reduction of the share capital without redemption of shares (item 8)The board of directors proposes that the shareholders’ meeting resolves upon reducing the Company’s share capital with SEK 46 122 393.450086. The reduction of the share capital will be made without redemption of ordinary shares by changing the share quota value from approximately SEK 0.60 to SEK 0.40 per share. The reduction amount shall be allocated to a non-restricted reserve to be used in accordance with the shareholders’ resolution.The reduction of share capital by changing the quota value is made in order to resolve on the share issues suggested for approval in items 9 and 10 below. After the reduction  the share capital will amount to SEK 92 244 785.60 divided into 230 611 964 ordinary shares (prior to the share issues)  each share with a quota value of SEK 0.40. The resolution to reduce the share capital is conditioned on that the share issues under items 9 and 10 and that the bonus issue under item 11  entailing an increase of the share capital with at least as much as the reduction amount  are registered at the Swedish Companies Registration Office and that the reduction of the share capital  the share issues and the bonus issue together do not result in a decrease in the Company’s share capital. The resolution to reduce the share capital is conditioned by a change of the articles of association as set out in item 7 above.Approval of the Board of Directors resolution on new share issue of ordinary shares with deviation from the shareholders preferential rights (item 9)The Board of Directors has on 5 April 2023  subject to the subsequent approval of the general meeting  resolved to increase the Company’s share capital by up to SEK 20 000 000 through the issue of up to 50 000 000 new ordinary shares  each with a quota value of SEK 0.40.The following terms and conditions shall apply to the issue of shares. The subscription price per ordinary share shall correspond with the quota value  i.e. SEK 0.40. With deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights  the new shares may only be subscribed for by Beof Company Ltd. Subscription for new shares shall be made on a separate subscription list no later than 5 April 2023. Payment for the subscribed shares shall be made no later than on 11 May 2023. The Board of Directors shall be entitled to extend the subscription period and the time of payment. The new shares do not entitle to participation with preferential rights under the new share issue according to item 11 below. The new shares convey right to dividends for the first time on the first record date set for dividends after the registration of the new shares with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights is that the Company is in great need of capital and the Board of Directors assesses that the expected issue proceeds in a time and cost-effective manner enable the Company to (i) ensure repayment of overdue loans  and (ii) ensure financing of components in order to enable the delivery of digital pens according to a potential order that the Company is currently negotiating with a government in the Middle East. The order and the license agreement that the order is expected to entail will  in the Board of Director's opinion  contribute with great value for the Company's shareholders  which justifies the issue's deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights. Furthermore  the issue enables the Company to carry out the share issue according to item 10 below with a guarantee undertaking from Beof Company Ltd of SEK 10 million. The subscription price has been determined based on the closing price of the Company's ordinary share on Nasdaq Stockholm on April 4  2023 of SEK 0.39 per share  which means that the subscription price corresponds to a premium of approximately 2.6 percent.The resolution is conditioned by the shareholders’ meeting resolving on the proposals set out in items 7  8  10 and 11.Approval of the Board of Directors resolution to a rights issue of ordinary shares (item 10)The Board of Directors has on 5 April 2023  subject to the subsequent approval of the general meeting  resolved to issue new ordinary shares on the following terms and conditions.The Company’s share capital may be increased by up to SEK 20 000 000 through the issue of up to 50 000 000 new ordinary shares  each with a quota value of SEK 0.40.The shareholders of the Company shall have preferential rights to subscribe for the new shares in relation the number of shares previously held. In case not all shares have been subscribed for  the board of directors shall decide that allotment of shares subscribed for without subscription rights shall take place up to the maximum amount of the issue  whereby the board of directors primarily will allot shares to those who also subscribed for shares based on subscription rights  and in the event of over subscription  pro rata to their subscription based on subscription rights. Secondly  the board of directors will allot shares to those who subscribed for shares without subscription rights  and if full allotment cannot be made  pro rata to their subscription. To the extent not possible  allotment shall be made through drawing of lots  and finally  subject to such allocation being required in order for the issue to be fully subscribed  to the guarantors of the issue with allotment in relation to their respective subscription (based on the guarantee undertakings).The record date for determining which shareholders shall be entitled to subscribe for new ordinary shares on a preferential basis shall be 10 May 2023.Subscription for new shares based on subscription rights shall be made through payment in cash during the period from 12 May 2023 until  and including 26 May 2023. The Board of Directors shall be entitled to extend the subscription period.Subscription without subscription rights shall be made through notice on special application form during the period from 12 May 2023 until  and including 26 May 2023. The Board of Directors shall be entitled to extend the subscription period. Payment for the new shares shall be made at the latest three business days following the date of the dispatch of a contract note to the subscriber  specifying allocation of shares  or such later date as the Board of Directors may decide.It is recalled that the Board of Directors has the right to grant retrospective payment by way of set-off in accordance with Chapter 13 Section 41 of the Swedish Companies Act.The new ordinary shares shall entitle to dividends as from the first record date for dividends following registration of the new share issue with the Swedish Companies Registration Office. Trading with subscription rights will take place during the period from 12 May 2023 until  and including 26 May 2023. Trading in BTA (Paid Subscribed Shares) is expected to take place from 12 May 2023 and is expected to finish during week 23 2023.The resolution is conditioned by the shareholders’ meeting resolving on the proposals set out in items 7  8  9 and 11.Resolution regarding bonus issue (item 11)The board of directors proposes that the shareholders decide to carry out a bonus issue thereby increasing the share capital with SEK 46 122 393.450086 by making use of the Company’s non-restricted equity. The bonus issue is carried out without issuing new shares.The resolution is conditioned by the shareholders’ meeting resolving on the proposals set out in items 7 and 8 above.Resolution regarding reduction of the share capital without redemption of ordinary shares (item 12)The board of directors proposes that the shareholders’ meeting resolves upon reducing the Company’s share capital by an amount in SEK corresponding to the increase in the share capital pursuant to the resolutions on the share issues under items 9 and 10 above minus the minimum amount required for the share's quotient value after the reduction to correspond to a whole number of öre. The reduction of the share capital will be made without redemption of shares by changing the share quota value. The reduction amount shall be allocated to a non-restricted reserve to be used in accordance with the shareholders’ resolution.The reduction of share capital by changing the quota value is made in order to ensure that the resolution to reduce the share capital in item 8  the resolutions on the share issues in items 9 and 10  and the resolution on a bonus issue in item 11 together do not result in a decrease in the Company’s share capital.The resolution to reduce the share capital is conditioned by the shareholders’ meeting resolving on the proposals set out in items 7 – 11 above.MiscellaneousThe Board of Directors  or a person appointed by the Board of Directors  will be authorised to make the minor changes in the resolutions under items 7 – 12 on the agenda and which may prove necessary in connection with registration of the resolutions with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and Euroclear Sweden AB.Complete proposals and documentation in accordance with the Swedish Companies Act (2005:551) will be kept available at the Company’s office as well as at the Company’s website www.anoto.com no later than 13 April  2023 and will be sent free of charge to those shareholders who request it and provide their postal address.According to Chapter 7  section 32 of the Swedish Companies Act  at a General Meeting the shareholders are entitled to require information from the Board of Directors and CEO regarding circumstances which may affect items on the agenda and circumstances which may affect the Company’s financial situation.Number of shares and votes in the CompanyAs of 5 April 2023  the total number of ordinary shares and votes in the Company was 230 611 964.

Terms defined in the Conditions shall have the same meaning in respect of each Series of Notes in this notice  unless otherwise defined herein. In accordance with Condition 6(e)(ii) and Condition 6(e)(2) (2023 Put Option) of each respective Series of Notes  the Issuer hereby gives notice to the holders of the Notes (each a “Holder” and together the “Holders”) that the Amendment Effective Date occurred on 4 April 2023 and  accordingly  the 2023 Put Option Period shall commence today  5 April 2023  and expire at 5:00 p.m. (New York time) on 19 April 2023. The identity and notice details of the Settlement Agent are set out below in this notice. The Issuer shall repurchase all Notes in respect of which an election has been validly completed and timely submitted by a Holder in accordance with the instructions provided in this notice  on 26 April 2023 (the “Settlement Date”). The repurchase price for each Note pursuant to the 2023 Put Option shall be 102% of its principal amount together with accrued but unpaid interest to (but excluding) the Settlement Date (the “Repurchase Price”). Any steps taken in respect of the 2023 Put Option must be in compliance with all applicable Sanctions laws and regulations. See “Compliance with applicable Sanctions laws and regulations” and “Repurchase of the Notes” below.

For the avoidance of doubt  the 2023 Put Option Election Notice defined in this notice is the 2023 Put Option Election Notice referred to in the Conditions and Holders do not need to obtain any form of notice from the Settlement Agent  provided that Holders follow the procedures outlined below. Holders that require assistance with respect to the procedures for participating in the 2023 Put Option should contact the Settlement Agent  the contact details for whom are set out on the last page of this 2023 Put Option Event Notice. Each Holder should deliver  or arrange to have delivered on its behalf  via account holders/direct participants in and through Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V. (“Euroclear”)  Clearstream Banking  société anonyme (“Clearstream  Luxembourg”)  or The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) (each a “Clearing System” and  together  the “Clearing Systems”) and in accordance with the requirements of the relevant Clearing System  a validly completed 2023 Put Option Election Notice that is received in each case by the Settlement Agent by the Expiration Deadline. The 2023 Put Option Election Notices must be submitted in respect of a principal amount of Notes in the relevant Series of Notes of no less than USD 200 000 each  and may be submitted in integral multiples of USD 1 000 in excess thereof. A 2023 Put Option Election Notice can be completed on behalf of one or more beneficial owner in respect of each Series of Notes. Holders are advised to confirm with any bank  securities broker or other intermediary through which they hold Notes as to when such intermediary would require to receive instructions from a Holder in order for that Holder to be able to participate in the 2023 Put Option prior to the Expiration Deadline. The deadlines set by any such intermediary and each Clearing System for the submission of 2023 Put Option Election Notices will be earlier than the Expiration Deadline specified in this notice. Submission of 2023 Put Option Election Notice Only a person who is shown in the records of the relevant Clearing System (a “Direct Participant”) may submit a 2023 Put Option Election Notice. Each Holder that is not a Direct Participant must arrange for the Direct Participant through which it holds the Notes to submit a 2023 Put Option Election Notice on its behalf to the relevant Clearing System before the deadlines specified by such Clearing System (which will be earlier than the deadlines specified in this notice) . The participation of Holders in the 2023 Put Option will be deemed to have occurred upon receipt by the Settlement Agent at or prior to the Expiration Deadline via the relevant Clearing System of a valid 2023 Put Option Election Notice submitted in accordance with the requirements of such Clearing System. The receipt of such 2023 Put Option Election Notice by the relevant Clearing System will be acknowledged in accordance with the standard practices of such Clearing System and will result in the blocking of the Notes in the Holder's account at the relevant Clearing System so that no transfers may be effected in relation to such Notes from the date the relevant 2023 Put Option Election Notice is submitted.1 Holders must take the appropriate steps through the relevant Clearing System so that no transfers may be effected in relation to such blocked Notes at any time after the date of submission of a 2023 Put Option Election Notice  in accordance with the requirements of the relevant Clearing System and the deadlines required by such Clearing System. By blocking Notes in the relevant Clearing System  each Direct Participant will be deemed to consent to have the relevant Clearing System provide details concerning such Direct Participant's identity to the Settlement Agent (and for the Settlement Agent to provide such details to the Issuer and its legal advisers). It is a term of the 2023 Put Option that 2023 Put Option Election Notices are irrevocable and no withdrawals are permitted. Procedures for Notes held through Euroclear and Clearstream  Luxembourg To participate Notes effectively in the 2023 Put Option  participants of Euroclear or Clearstream  Luxembourg  as the case may be  must electronically transmit their 2023 Put Option Election Notice via a message to Euroclear or Clearstream  Luxembourg  as the case may be  containing the following information: the event or reference number issued by Euroclear or Clearstream  Luxembourg; the name of the Direct Participant and the securities account number in which the Notes the Holder wishes to participate in the 2023 Put Option are held; the ISINs and Common Codes of such Notes; the principal amount of the Notes; and any other information as may be required by Euroclear or Clearstream  Luxembourg  and duly notified to the Holder prior to the submission of the 2023 Put Option Election Notice. In addition  each Holder must: cause Euroclear or Clearstream  Luxembourg  as the case may be  to block the position in such Notes in accordance with the procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream  Luxembourg  as the case may be; and instruct Euroclear or Clearstream  Luxembourg  as the case may be  to send the Settlement Agent an electronic message confirming: the Direct Participant's 2023 Put Option Election Notice; and that the position in such Notes has been blocked from trading pending settlement of the 2023 Put Option. Euroclear and Clearstream  Luxembourg will collect from the Direct Participants: instructions to: participate the Notes in the 2023 Put Option and deliver the acceptances held by them on behalf of their Direct Participants; and credit their accounts on the Settlement Date  in respect to all Notes in respect of which a 2023 Put Option Election Notice has been validly submitted; and irrevocable authorisation to disclose the name of the Direct Participants and information about the foregoing instructions to the Settlement Agent (and for the Settlement Agent to provide such details to the Issuer and its legal advisers). By participating in the 2023 Put Option in this manner  Holders will be deemed to have acknowledged that they have received this 2023 Put Event Notice and agree to be bound by the terms of this 2023 Put Event Notice and that the Issuer may enforce such agreement against such Holders. The 2023 Put Option Election Notices must be delivered to  and received by  Euroclear and Clearstream  Luxembourg in accordance with the relevant procedures and on or prior to the relevant deadline established by them. Holders are responsible for informing themselves of such deadlines and for arranging the due and timely delivery of 2023 Put Option Election Notice to Euroclear or Clearstream  Luxembourg. Holders should note that Euroclear and Clearstream  Luxembourg are not direct participants in DTC in respect of the Rule 144A Notes and 2023 Put Option Election Notices delivered to Euroclear and/or Clearstream  Luxembourg in respect of such Notes shall in turn be the subject of corresponding 2023 Put Option Election Notices from Euroclear and/or Clearstream  Luxembourg to DTC via their Direct Participants. Holders should ensure that they submit a 2023 Put Option Election Notice by such deadline as Euroclear and/or Clearstream  Luxembourg require to allow Euroclear and/or Clearstream  Luxembourg to provide corresponding 2023 Put Option Election Notices via their Direct Participants to DTC. Procedures for Notes held through DTC Any Holder who holds Notes through DTC must arrange for a Direct Participant in DTC to electronically transmit the Holder’s 2023 Put Option Election Notice through DTC’s Automated Tender Offer Program (ATOP)  for which the 2023 Put Option will be eligible. Accordingly  a DTC participant whose name appears on the security position listing as the Holder of the Notes must electronically transmit its acceptance of the 2023 Put Option by causing DTC to transfer Notes in the participant’s account to the Settlement Agent’s account at DTC in accordance with DTC’s ATOP procedures. DTC will then send an agent’s message (as hereinafter defined) to the Settlement Agent in respect of the Notes. An “agent’s message” is a message  transmitted by DTC  received by the Settlement Agent and forming part of the book-entry confirmation  which states that DTC has received an express acknowledgement from the participant that such participant has received this 2023 Put Option Event Notice and agrees to be bound by the terms of the 2023 Put Option  and that the Issuer may enforce the terms of the 2023 Put Option against such participant. Although transfer of the Notes to the Settlement Agent’s account at DTC may be effected through book-entry at DTC  an agent’s message must be transmitted by DTC and received by the Settlement Agent on or prior to the Expiration Deadline in order to validly tender Notes pursuant to the 2023 Put Option. Notes tendered through DTC’s ATOP system will be held to the order of the Settlement Agent until the Settlement Date. Holders who intend to participate their Notes in the 2023 Put Option on the date of the Expiration Deadline should allow sufficient time for completion of the ATOP procedures during the normal business hours of DTC on such date. All 2023 Put Option Election Notices submitted through DTC’s ATOP system must be submitted in accordance with the deadlines and procedures established by DTC and an agent’s message with respect to participation in the 2023 Put Option must be received by the Settlement Agent on or prior to the Expiration Deadline. There are no letters of transmittal or guaranteed delivery procedures for the 2023 Put Option. Holders who hold Notes through DTC must participate their Notes in the 2023 Put Option through DTC’s ATOP procedures. Tax consequences In view of the number of different jurisdictions where tax laws may apply to a Holder  this notice does not discuss the tax consequences for Holders arising from the purchase of Notes by the Issuer pursuant to the 2023 Put Option. Holders are urged to consult their own professional advisers regarding these possible tax consequences under the laws of the jurisdictions that apply to them or to the sale of their Notes and the receipt pursuant to the 2023 Put Option of the Repurchase Price. Holders are liable for their own taxes and have no recourse to the Issuer or the Settlement Agent with respect to taxes arising in connection with the 2023 Put Option. Compliance with applicable Sanctions laws and regulations By submitting a 2023 Put Option Election Notice in the manner specified above  the Holder represents and warrants to the Issuer and the Settlement Agent on the date of submission of the 2023 Put Option Election Notice and on each date until the Settlement Date that: (i) it (and any person acting for  on behalf of  or at the direction of or through it)  the person(s) having a substantial influence over it (and any person acting for  on behalf of  or at the direction of or through it) up to the ultimate beneficial owners  and each of their officers or directors (A) is not  and is not acting for or on behalf of  or at the direction of or through  a Sanctions Disqualified Person; and (B) has complied with all Sanctions in connection with the 2023 Put Option; (ii) it (and any person acting for  on behalf of  or at the direction of or through it) has submitted the 2023 Put Option Election Notice in compliance with Sanctions; and (iii) it (and any person acting for  on behalf of  or at the direction of or through it) has not taken or omitted to take any action in breach of Sanctions or which will or could result in the Issuer acting in breach of Sanctions in connection with the 2023 Put Option and the 2023 Put Option Election Notice; and it shall notify the Issuer (via the Settlement Agent) if at any time during the intervening period between the date of submission of its 2023 Put Option Election Notice and the Settlement Date if it would not be able to repeat the representations and warranties in paragraph (a) above. Holders who are not Sanctions Disqualified Persons  and are not acting for  on behalf of  or at the direction of or through Sanctions Disqualified Persons may submit a 2023 Put Option Election Notice and participate in the 2023 Put Option in respect of their relevant Series of Notes. Holders who are  or are acting for  on behalf of  at the direction of or through  Sanctions Disqualified Persons are not permitted to submit a 2023 Put Option Election Notice or participate in the 2023 Put Option. Repurchase of the Notes On the Settlement Date  the Issuer will  but only in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations  including Sanctions  purchase such Notes of Holders who have validly submitted a 2023 Put Option Election Notice. Such tendered Notes will be cancelled upon payment to the Holder of the Repurchase Price to the account specified by such Holder in their validly submitted 2023 Put Option Election Notice  provided that such account must not be held at or through a bank or custody account which is a Sanctioned Disqualified Person and must otherwise be in compliance with Sanctions. For the avoidance of doubt  the Issuer’s obligations to purchase Notes under the 2023 Put Option shall only arise with respect to Notes which are not held by Holders that are Sanctions Disqualified Persons and are not held through a Sanctions Disqualified Person  and only if such purchase is otherwise in compliance with Sanctions. 2023 Noteholders may contact the Settlement Agent via email at veon@is.kroll.com if they require assistance with any of the above.

Terms defined in the Conditions shall have the same meaning in respect of each Series of Notes in this notice  unless otherwise defined herein. In accordance with Condition 6(e)(ii) and Condition 6(e)(2) (2023 Put Option) of each respective Series of Notes  the Issuer hereby gives notice to the holders of the Notes (each a “Holder” and together the “Holders”) that the Amendment Effective Date occurred on 4 April 2023 and  accordingly  the 2023 Put Option Period shall commence today  5 April 2023  and expire at 5:00 p.m. (New York time) on 19 April 2023. The identity and notice details of the Settlement Agent are set out below in this notice. The Issuer shall repurchase all Notes in respect of which an election has been validly completed and timely submitted by a Holder in accordance with the instructions provided in this notice  on 26 April 2023 (the “Settlement Date”). The repurchase price for each Note pursuant to the 2023 Put Option shall be 102% of its principal amount together with accrued but unpaid interest to (but excluding) the Settlement Date (the “Repurchase Price”). Any steps taken in respect of the 2023 Put Option must be in compliance with all applicable Sanctions laws and regulations. See “Compliance with applicable Sanctions laws and regulations” and “Repurchase of the Notes” below. Procedure for Holders who wish to submit an election Summary of procedure Holders who wish to submit an election must have submitted their validly completed electronic election notice (the “2023 Put Option Election Notice”) to Kroll Issuer Services Limited (as the Settlement Agent) as a response to the corporate action within the time period commencing 5 April 2023  and ending 5:00 p.m. (New York time) on 19 April 2023 (with the end time being the “Expiration Deadline”)  pursuant to the election process further described below. For the avoidance of doubt  the 2023 Put Option Election Notice defined in this notice is the 2023 Put Option Election Notice referred to in the Conditions and Holders do not need to obtain any form of notice from the Settlement Agent  provided that Holders follow the procedures outlined below. Holders that require assistance with respect to the procedures for participating in the 2023 Put Option should contact the Settlement Agent  the contact details for whom are set out on the last page of this 2023 Put Option Event Notice. Each Holder should deliver  or arrange to have delivered on its behalf  via account holders/direct participants in and through Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V. (“Euroclear”)  Clearstream Banking  société anonyme (“Clearstream  Luxembourg”)  or The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) (each a “Clearing System” and  together  the “Clearing Systems”) and in accordance with the requirements of the relevant Clearing System  a validly completed 2023 Put Option Election Notice that is received in each case by the Settlement Agent by the Expiration Deadline. The 2023 Put Option Election Notices must be submitted in respect of a principal amount of Notes in the relevant Series of Notes of no less than USD 200 000 each  and may be submitted in integral multiples of USD 1 000 in excess thereof. A 2023 Put Option Election Notice can be completed on behalf of one or more beneficial owner in respect of each Series of Notes. Holders are advised to confirm with any bank  securities broker or other intermediary through which they hold Notes as to when such intermediary would require to receive instructions from a Holder in order for that Holder to be able to participate in the 2023 Put Option prior to the Expiration Deadline. The deadlines set by any such intermediary and each Clearing System for the submission of 2023 Put Option Election Notices will be earlier than the Expiration Deadline specified in this notice. Submission of 2023 Put Option Election Notice Only a person who is shown in the records of the relevant Clearing System (a “Direct Participant”) may submit a 2023 Put Option Election Notice. Each Holder that is not a Direct Participant must arrange for the Direct Participant through which it holds the Notes to submit a 2023 Put Option Election Notice on its behalf to the relevant Clearing System before the deadlines specified by such Clearing System (which will be earlier than the deadlines specified in this notice) . The participation of Holders in the 2023 Put Option will be deemed to have occurred upon receipt by the Settlement Agent at or prior to the Expiration Deadline via the relevant Clearing System of a valid 2023 Put Option Election Notice submitted in accordance with the requirements of such Clearing System. The receipt of such 2023 Put Option Election Notice by the relevant Clearing System will be acknowledged in accordance with the standard practices of such Clearing System and will result in the blocking of the Notes in the Holder's account at the relevant Clearing System so that no transfers may be effected in relation to such Notes from the date the relevant 2023 Put Option Election Notice is submitted.1 Holders must take the appropriate steps through the relevant Clearing System so that no transfers may be effected in relation to such blocked Notes at any time after the date of submission of a 2023 Put Option Election Notice  in accordance with the requirements of the relevant Clearing System and the deadlines required by such Clearing System. By blocking Notes in the relevant Clearing System  each Direct Participant will be deemed to consent to have the relevant Clearing System provide details concerning such Direct Participant's identity to the Settlement Agent (and for the Settlement Agent to provide such details to the Issuer and its legal advisers). It is a term of the 2023 Put Option that 2023 Put Option Election Notices are irrevocable and no withdrawals are permitted. Procedures for Notes held through Euroclear and Clearstream  Luxembourg To participate Notes effectively in the 2023 Put Option  participants of Euroclear or Clearstream  Luxembourg  as the case may be  must electronically transmit their 2023 Put Option Election Notice via a message to Euroclear or Clearstream  Luxembourg  as the case may be  containing the following information: the event or reference number issued by Euroclear or Clearstream  Luxembourg; the name of the Direct Participant and the securities account number in which the Notes the Holder wishes to participate in the 2023 Put Option are held; the ISINs and Common Codes of such Notes; the principal amount of the Notes; and any other information as may be required by Euroclear or Clearstream  Luxembourg  and duly notified to the Holder prior to the submission of the 2023 Put Option Election Notice. In addition  each Holder must: cause Euroclear or Clearstream  Luxembourg  as the case may be  to block the position in such Notes in accordance with the procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream  Luxembourg  as the case may be; and instruct Euroclear or Clearstream  Luxembourg  as the case may be  to send the Settlement Agent an electronic message confirming: the Direct Participant's 2023 Put Option Election Notice; and that the position in such Notes has been blocked from trading pending settlement of the 2023 Put Option. Euroclear and Clearstream  Luxembourg will collect from the Direct Participants: instructions to: participate the Notes in the 2023 Put Option and deliver the acceptances held by them on behalf of their Direct Participants; and credit their accounts on the Settlement Date  in respect to all Notes in respect of which a 2023 Put Option Election Notice has been validly submitted; and irrevocable authorisation to disclose the name of the Direct Participants and information about the foregoing instructions to the Settlement Agent (and for the Settlement Agent to provide such details to the Issuer and its legal advisers). By participating in the 2023 Put Option in this manner  Holders will be deemed to have acknowledged that they have received this 2023 Put Event Notice and agree to be bound by the terms of this 2023 Put Event Notice and that the Issuer may enforce such agreement against such Holders. The 2023 Put Option Election Notices must be delivered to  and received by  Euroclear and Clearstream  Luxembourg in accordance with the relevant procedures and on or prior to the relevant deadline established by them. Holders are responsible for informing themselves of such deadlines and for arranging the due and timely delivery of 2023 Put Option Election Notice to Euroclear or Clearstream  Luxembourg. Holders should note that Euroclear and Clearstream  Luxembourg are not direct participants in DTC in respect of the Rule 144A Notes and 2023 Put Option Election Notices delivered to Euroclear and/or Clearstream  Luxembourg in respect of such Notes shall in turn be the subject of corresponding 2023 Put Option Election Notices from Euroclear and/or Clearstream  Luxembourg to DTC via their Direct Participants. Holders should ensure that they submit a 2023 Put Option Election Notice by such deadline as Euroclear and/or Clearstream  Luxembourg require to allow Euroclear and/or Clearstream  Luxembourg to provide corresponding 2023 Put Option Election Notices via their Direct Participants to DTC. Procedures for Notes held through DTC Any Holder who holds Notes through DTC must arrange for a Direct Participant in DTC to electronically transmit the Holder’s 2023 Put Option Election Notice through DTC’s Automated Tender Offer Program (ATOP)  for which the 2023 Put Option will be eligible. Accordingly  a DTC participant whose name appears on the security position listing as the Holder of the Notes must electronically transmit its acceptance of the 2023 Put Option by causing DTC to transfer Notes in the participant’s account to the Settlement Agent’s account at DTC in accordance with DTC’s ATOP procedures. DTC will then send an agent’s message (as hereinafter defined) to the Settlement Agent in respect of the Notes. An “agent’s message” is a message  transmitted by DTC  received by the Settlement Agent and forming part of the book-entry confirmation  which states that DTC has received an express acknowledgement from the participant that such participant has received this 2023 Put Option Event Notice and agrees to be bound by the terms of the 2023 Put Option  and that the Issuer may enforce the terms of the 2023 Put Option against such participant. Although transfer of the Notes to the Settlement Agent’s account at DTC may be effected through book-entry at DTC  an agent’s message must be transmitted by DTC and received by the Settlement Agent on or prior to the Expiration Deadline in order to validly tender Notes pursuant to the 2023 Put Option. Notes tendered through DTC’s ATOP system will be held to the order of the Settlement Agent until the Settlement Date. Holders who intend to participate their Notes in the 2023 Put Option on the date of the Expiration Deadline should allow sufficient time for completion of the ATOP procedures during the normal business hours of DTC on such date. All 2023 Put Option Election Notices submitted through DTC’s ATOP system must be submitted in accordance with the deadlines and procedures established by DTC and an agent’s message with respect to participation in the 2023 Put Option must be received by the Settlement Agent on or prior to the Expiration Deadline. There are no letters of transmittal or guaranteed delivery procedures for the 2023 Put Option. Holders who hold Notes through DTC must participate their Notes in the 2023 Put Option through DTC’s ATOP procedures. Tax consequences In view of the number of different jurisdictions where tax laws may apply to a Holder  this notice does not discuss the tax consequences for Holders arising from the purchase of Notes by the Issuer pursuant to the 2023 Put Option. Holders are urged to consult their own professional advisers regarding these possible tax consequences under the laws of the jurisdictions that apply to them or to the sale of their Notes and the receipt pursuant to the 2023 Put Option of the Repurchase Price. Holders are liable for their own taxes and have no recourse to the Issuer or the Settlement Agent with respect to taxes arising in connection with the 2023 Put Option. Compliance with applicable Sanctions laws and regulations By submitting a 2023 Put Option Election Notice in the manner specified above  the Holder represents and warrants to the Issuer and the Settlement Agent on the date of submission of the 2023 Put Option Election Notice and on each date until the Settlement Date that: (i) it (and any person acting for  on behalf of  or at the direction of or through it)  the person(s) having a substantial influence over it (and any person acting for  on behalf of  or at the direction of or through it) up to the ultimate beneficial owners  and each of their officers or directors (A) is not  and is not acting for or on behalf of  or at the direction of or through  a Sanctions Disqualified Person; and (B) has complied with all Sanctions in connection with the 2023 Put Option; (ii) it (and any person acting for  on behalf of  or at the direction of or through it) has submitted the 2023 Put Option Election Notice in compliance with Sanctions; and (iii) it (and any person acting for  on behalf of  or at the direction of or through it) has not taken or omitted to take any action in breach of Sanctions or which will or could result in the Issuer acting in breach of Sanctions in connection with the 2023 Put Option and the 2023 Put Option Election Notice; and it shall notify the Issuer (via the Settlement Agent) if at any time during the intervening period between the date of submission of its 2023 Put Option Election Notice and the Settlement Date if it would not be able to repeat the representations and warranties in paragraph (a) above. Holders who are not Sanctions Disqualified Persons  and are not acting for  on behalf of  or at the direction of or through Sanctions Disqualified Persons may submit a 2023 Put Option Election Notice and participate in the 2023 Put Option in respect of their relevant Series of Notes. Holders who are  or are acting for  on behalf of  at the direction of or through  Sanctions Disqualified Persons are not permitted to submit a 2023 Put Option Election Notice or participate in the 2023 Put Option. Repurchase of the Notes On the Settlement Date  the Issuer will  but only in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations  including Sanctions  purchase such Notes of Holders who have validly submitted a 2023 Put Option Election Notice. Such tendered Notes will be cancelled upon payment to the Holder of the Repurchase Price to the account specified by such Holder in their validly submitted 2023 Put Option Election Notice  provided that such account must not be held at or through a bank or custody account which is a Sanctioned Disqualified Person and must otherwise be in compliance with Sanctions. For the avoidance of doubt  the Issuer’s obligations to purchase Notes under the 2023 Put Option shall only arise with respect to Notes which are not held by Holders that are Sanctions Disqualified Persons and are not held through a Sanctions Disqualified Person  and only if such purchase is otherwise in compliance with Sanctions. 2023 Noteholders may contact the Settlement Agent via email at veon@is.kroll.com if they require assistance with any of the above.

Furthermore  the board of directors proposes an amendment to the limits on number of shares set out in § 5 in the articles of association to be not less than 230 000 000 and not more than 920 000 000 shares.The resolution is conditioned by the shareholders’ resolution to reduce the share capital as set out in item 8 below.Resolution regarding reduction of the share capital without redemption of shares (item 8)The board of directors proposes that the shareholders’ meeting resolves upon reducing the Company’s share capital with SEK 46 122 393.450086. The reduction of the share capital will be made without redemption of ordinary shares by changing the share quota value from approximately SEK 0.60 to SEK 0.40 per share. The reduction amount shall be allocated to a non-restricted reserve to be used in accordance with the shareholders’ resolution.The reduction of share capital by changing the quota value is made in order to resolve on the share issues suggested for approval in items 9 and 10 below. After the reduction  the share capital will amount to SEK 92 244 785.60 divided into 230 611 964 ordinary shares (prior to the share issues)  each share with a quota value of SEK 0.40. The resolution to reduce the share capital is conditioned on that the share issues under items 9 and 10 and that the bonus issue under item 11  entailing an increase of the share capital with at least as much as the reduction amount  are registered at the Swedish Companies Registration Office and that the reduction of the share capital  the share issues and the bonus issue together do not result in a decrease in the Company’s share capital. The resolution to reduce the share capital is conditioned by a change of the articles of association as set out in item 7 above.Approval of the Board of Directors resolution on new share issue of ordinary shares with deviation from the shareholders preferential rights (item 9)The Board of Directors has on 5 April 2023  subject to the subsequent approval of the general meeting  resolved to increase the Company’s share capital by up to SEK 20 000 000 through the issue of up to 50 000 000 new ordinary shares  each with a quota value of SEK 0.40.The following terms and conditions shall apply to the issue of shares. The subscription price per ordinary share shall correspond with the quota value  i.e. SEK 0.40. With deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights  the new shares may only be subscribed for by Beof Company Ltd. Subscription for new shares shall be made on a separate subscription list no later than 5 April 2023. Payment for the subscribed shares shall be made no later than on 11 May 2023. The Board of Directors shall be entitled to extend the subscription period and the time of payment. The new shares do not entitle to participation with preferential rights under the new share issue according to item 11 below. The new shares convey right to dividends for the first time on the first record date set for dividends after the registration of the new shares with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights is that the Company is in great need of capital and the Board of Directors assesses that the expected issue proceeds in a time and cost-effective manner enable the Company to (i) ensure repayment of overdue loans  and (ii) ensure financing of components in order to enable the delivery of digital pens according to a potential order that the Company is currently negotiating with a government in the Middle East. The order and the license agreement that the order is expected to entail will  in the Board of Director's opinion  contribute with great value for the Company's shareholders  which justifies the issue's deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights. Furthermore  the issue enables the Company to carry out the share issue according to item 10 below with a guarantee undertaking from Beof Company Ltd of SEK 10 million. The subscription price has been determined based on the closing price of the Company's ordinary share on Nasdaq Stockholm on April 4  2023 of SEK 0.39 per share  which means that the subscription price corresponds to a premium of approximately 2.6 percent.The resolution is conditioned by the shareholders’ meeting resolving on the proposals set out in items 7  8  10 and 11.Approval of the Board of Directors resolution to a rights issue of ordinary shares (item 10)The Board of Directors has on 5 April 2023  subject to the subsequent approval of the general meeting  resolved to issue new ordinary shares on the following terms and conditions.The Company’s share capital may be increased by up to SEK 20 000 000 through the issue of up to 50 000 000 new ordinary shares  each with a quota value of SEK 0.40.The shareholders of the Company shall have preferential rights to subscribe for the new shares in relation the number of shares previously held.

Furthermore  the board of directors proposes an amendment to the limits on number of shares set out in § 5 in the articles of association to be not less than 230 000 000 and not more than 920 000 000 shares.The resolution is conditioned by the shareholders’ resolution to reduce the share capital as set out in item 8 below.Resolution regarding reduction of the share capital without redemption of shares (item 8)The board of directors proposes that the shareholders’ meeting resolves upon reducing the Company’s share capital with SEK 46 122 393.450086. The reduction of the share capital will be made without redemption of ordinary shares by changing the share quota value from approximately SEK 0.60 to SEK 0.40 per share. The reduction amount shall be allocated to a non-restricted reserve to be used in accordance with the shareholders’ resolution.The reduction of share capital by changing the quota value is made in order to resolve on the share issues suggested for approval in items 9 and 10 below. After the reduction  the share capital will amount to SEK 92 244 785.60 divided into 230 611 964 ordinary shares (prior to the share issues)  each share with a quota value of SEK 0.40. The resolution to reduce the share capital is conditioned on that the share issues under items 9 and 10 and that the bonus issue under item 11  entailing an increase of the share capital with at least as much as the reduction amount  are registered at the Swedish Companies Registration Office and that the reduction of the share capital  the share issues and the bonus issue together do not result in a decrease in the Company’s share capital. The resolution to reduce the share capital is conditioned by a change of the articles of association as set out in item 7 above.Approval of the Board of Directors resolution on new share issue of ordinary shares with deviation from the shareholders preferential rights (item 9)The Board of Directors has on 5 April 2023  subject to the subsequent approval of the general meeting  resolved to increase the Company’s share capital by up to SEK 20 000 000 through the issue of up to 50 000 000 new ordinary shares  each with a quota value of SEK 0.40.The following terms and conditions shall apply to the issue of shares. The subscription price per ordinary share shall correspond with the quota value  i.e. SEK 0.40. With deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights  the new shares may only be subscribed for by Beof Company Ltd. Subscription for new shares shall be made on a separate subscription list no later than 5 April 2023. Payment for the subscribed shares shall be made no later than on 11 May 2023. The Board of Directors shall be entitled to extend the subscription period and the time of payment. The new shares do not entitle to participation with preferential rights under the new share issue according to item 11 below. The new shares convey right to dividends for the first time on the first record date set for dividends after the registration of the new shares with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights is that the Company is in great need of capital and the Board of Directors assesses that the expected issue proceeds in a time and cost-effective manner enable the Company to (i) ensure repayment of overdue loans  and (ii) ensure financing of components in order to enable the delivery of digital pens according to a potential order that the Company is currently negotiating with a government in the Middle East. The order and the license agreement that the order is expected to entail will  in the Board of Director's opinion  contribute with great value for the Company's shareholders  which justifies the issue's deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights. Furthermore  the issue enables the Company to carry out the share issue according to item 10 below with a guarantee undertaking from Beof Company Ltd of SEK 10 million. The subscription price has been determined based on the closing price of the Company's ordinary share on Nasdaq Stockholm on April 4  2023 of SEK 0.39 per share  which means that the subscription price corresponds to a premium of approximately 2.6 percent.The resolution is conditioned by the shareholders’ meeting resolving on the proposals set out in items 7  8  10 and 11.Approval of the Board of Directors resolution to a rights issue of ordinary shares (item 10)The Board of Directors has on 5 April 2023  subject to the subsequent approval of the general meeting  resolved to issue new ordinary shares on the following terms and conditions.The Company’s share capital may be increased by up to SEK 20 000 000 through the issue of up to 50 000 000 new ordinary shares  each with a quota value of SEK 0.40.The shareholders of the Company shall have preferential rights to subscribe for the new shares in relation the number of shares previously held.

Previous Board experience is another important competency. Board members In the opinion of the Nomination Committee  the Board has a suitable composition considering the company's operations  financial position  stage of development and circumstances otherwise. An important starting point for the proposal of Board members was that the Board's composition should reflect and provide space for the different knowledge and experience that the company's strategic development and governance may demand. The company has a diversity policy for the Group that includes the company's Board and management. The company's diversity policy  which was prepared in accordance with the Code's rule 4.1  aims to achieve an even distribution of people in the company in terms of age  gender  education and professional background. The diversity policy forms the basis of the Nomination Committee's proposal to the Board at the 2022 Annual General Meeting. Chairman The Chairman of the Board  Robert M. Hanser  is not employed by the company and does not have any assignments with the company beyond his chairmanship. It is the opinion of the Board that Robert M. Hanser ensures that the Board conducts its assignments efficiently and also fulfils its duties in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. The Board's working procedures The Board is responsible for the company's organization and management and is to also make decisions pertaining to strategic issues. During 2021  the Board held nine meetings (18)  of which none (2) were independent. Minutes of the meetings have been kept by the Board secretary  which is the Group's Director of Legal Affairs and Sustainability or the CFO. For matters which present a risk of a conflict of interest  independent board meetings are held in which the Board members representing LKQ Cooperation do not participate or take part of the minutes. In matters that risk involving conflicts of interest  independent board meetings are held where the board members representing LKQ Cooperation do not participate or take part in the minutes. Relevant meeting documentation was sent to all members prior to each meeting  which were then held in accordance with the approved agenda. On occasions  other senior executives participated in Board Meetings in a reporting capacity  as necessary. No dissenting opinions to be recorded in the minutes were expressed­ at any of the meetings during the year. The Board ­meetings during the year addressed the fixed items of each meeting agenda  such as the year-end financial statement including dividend proposal  interim reports  budgets  strategies  business situation  financial reporting  investments and market development. Duties of the Board of Directors The Board of Directors is responsible for ensuring that the company has good internal control to protect the owners' investment and the company's assets. In accordance with the requirements of the Code  the Board's aim was to devote particular attention to establishing overall goals for the operations and decide on strategies by which to achieve these goals and to continuously evaluate the operating management  with the aim of ensuring the company's governance  management and control. The Board is responsible for ensuring that suitable systems are in place for the monitoring and control of the company's operations and the risks to the company associated with its operations  that control is implemented of compliance with laws  internal guidelines and other regulations and that the provision of external information is open  objective and rele- vant. The Board of Directors address all interim reports and the Annual Report before they are published. The Audit Committee reports to the Board regarding matters concerning internal control  including matters for decision. Minutes from the Audit Committee meetings are available to the Board members. The tasks of the Board also include establishing necessary guidelines for the com- pany's conduct in society with the aim of securing its long-termvalue-creating ability. There are written instructions that regulate the internal rules of procedure in the Board and the distribution of assignments between the Board and the President and CEO  and for the reporting process. The instructions are reviewed annually and are primarily: the rules of procedure for the Board's work  instructions for the President and authorization regulations. The Board evaluates its work every year and it is the duty of the Chairman of the Board to ensure that evaluation is performed. In 2021  the Chairman organized a digital board evaluation with an external supplier for all Board members. The collective opinion based on the 2021 evaluation is that the Board's work functioned well during the year and that the Board fulfilled the Code's requirements regarding the Board's work. Board Committees The Board has established a Remuneration Committee and an Audit Committee. The Committees' work mainly comprises preparing issues and providing consultation  although the Board can delegate authority to make decisions in specific cases.

Pursuant to the Merger plan  one (1) class A share in SelectImmune entitles the holder to 0.8 class A shares in Hamlet Pharma and one (1) class B share in SelectImmune entitles the holder to 0.8 class B shares in Hamlet Pharma (the ""Merger consideration"").In light of the above  the board of directors proposes that the general meeting resolves on a new issue of a maximum of 13 967 380 shares  of which 1 600 000 class A shares and 12 367 380 class B shares. The issue will entail an increase of the share capital in Hamlet Pharma with a maximum of SEK 139 673.8. The following conditions shall otherwise apply to the resolution:1. Entitled to receive newly issued class A shares  in accordance with the above-mentioned exchange ratio  are the holders of class A shares in SelectImmune as of the date of the Swedish Companies Registration Office's registration of the Merger. Entitled to receive newly issued class B shares  in accordance with the above-mentioned exchange ratio  are the holders of class B shares in SelectImmune as of the date of the Swedish Companies Registration Office's registration of the Merger.2. Only whole shares in Hamlet Pharma will be paid to shareholders of SelectImmune as Merger consideration. Aqurat Fondkommission AB (""Aqurat"") has been assigned to combine all fractions of class B shares in Hamlet Pharma that do not entitle to a whole new class B share in Hamlet Pharma as merger consideration and the total number of class B shares in Hamlet Pharma corresponding to such fractions will thereafter be sold by Aqurat on Spotlight Stock Market. The sale shall take place as soon as possible after the registration of the Merger with the Swedish Companies Registration Office. The proceeds of the sale of fractions shall be accounted for by Aqurat and thereafter paid to those entitled thereto in proportion to the value of the fractions held immediately prior to the sale. Such payment shall be made as soon as practicable after such sale of the fractions. All class A shares in SelectImmune are held by Linnane Pharma and thus no fractions will arise with respect to the class A shares in SelectImmune.3. The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights is that the newly issued shares shall constitute the Merger consideration in the Merger.4. The newly issued shares entitle the holder to receive dividends for the first time on the record date for dividends that occurs immediately after the new shares have been registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.5. The new class A shares shall be subject to restriction in accordance with Chapter 4  Section 6 of the Swedish Companies Act (conversion clause).The board of directors considers that the Merger consideration is reasonable from a financial point of view for Hamlet Pharma and beneficial for Hamlet Pharma and its shareholders. As a basis for this opinion  the board of directors of Hamlet Pharma has considered a number of factors  including  but not limited to  the volume-weighted average price paid for SelectImmune's class B share and Hamlet Pharma's class B share  respectively  30 trading days prior to the date of publication of the press release on 31 March 2023 and the Company's and SelectImmune's future prospects after the implementation of planned measures. SelectImmune has also obtained a so-called fairness opinion from Hjalmarsson & Partners Corporate Finance AB dated 30 March 2023  which states that as of that date  and based on the considerations set forth therein  the Merger consideration to be paid by the Company is reasonable for the Company from a financial point of view.The resolution is conditional upon and presumes that the general meeting also resolves on the approval of the Merger plan in accordance with item 9 on the agenda and that SelectImmune at a general meeting resolves on the approval of the Merger plan. The resolution shall also be conditional upon that the meeting resolves in accordance with the board of directors' proposal in Items 7-8 on the agenda as well as the other conditions for the Merger are fulfilled and that registration of the Merger is made with the Swedish Companies Registration Office no later than on 1 October 2023  or the later date decided jointly by the board of directors of Hamlet Pharma and SelectImmune in accordance with the Merger plan.For the present resolution to be valid it is required that the proposal is approved by shareholders holding at least two-thirds (2/3) of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the meeting.The board of directors  or the person appointed by the board of directors  shall be entitled to make the minor adjustments of the decision required in connection with the registration of the resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office  Euroclear Sweden AB or due to other formal requirements.Shareholders' right to request informationAccording to Chapter 7  Section 32 of the Swedish Companies Act  the board of directors and the CEO shall  if any shareholder so requests and the board of directors considers that this can be done without material damage to the Company  provide information on circumstances that may affect the assessment of an item on the agenda.DocumentationThe board of directors' complete proposal for resolution  the board of directors' reports pursuant to the Swedish Securities Council's statement AMN 2019:25 as well as the merger document prepared by the boards of directors of Hamlet Pharma and SelectImmune in connection with the Merger  will be made available at the Company's head office at the address Klinikgatan 32  222 42 in Lund not later than two weeks prior to the meeting and will be sent to the shareholders who so request and provide their postal address  free of charge.

Accordingly  a DTC participant whose name appears on the security position listing as the Holder of the Notes must electronically transmit its acceptance of the 2023 Put Option by causing DTC to transfer Notes in the participant’s account to the Settlement Agent’s account at DTC in accordance with DTC’s ATOP procedures. DTC will then send an agent’s message (as hereinafter defined) to the Settlement Agent in respect of the Notes.An “agent’s message” is a message  transmitted by DTC  received by the Settlement Agent and forming part of the book-entry confirmation  which states that DTC has received an express acknowledgement from the participant that such participant has received this 2023 Put Option Event Notice and agrees to be bound by the terms of the 2023 Put Option  and that the Issuer may enforce the terms of the 2023 Put Option against such participant.Although transfer of the Notes to the Settlement Agent’s account at DTC may be effected through book-entry at DTC  an agent’s message must be transmitted by DTC and received by the Settlement Agent on or prior to the Expiration Deadline in order to validly tender Notes pursuant to the 2023 Put Option. Notes tendered through DTC’s ATOP system will be held to the order of the Settlement Agent until the Settlement Date.Holders who intend to participate their Notes in the 2023 Put Option on the date of the Expiration Deadline should allow sufficient time for completion of the ATOP procedures during the normal business hours of DTC on such date. All 2023 Put Option Election Notices submitted through DTC’s ATOP system must be submitted in accordance with the deadlines and procedures established by DTC and an agent’s message with respect to participation in the 2023 Put Option must be received by the Settlement Agent on or prior to the Expiration Deadline.There are no letters of transmittal or guaranteed delivery procedures for the 2023 Put Option. Holders who hold Notes through DTC must participate their Notes in the 2023 Put Option through DTC’s ATOP procedures.Tax consequencesIn view of the number of different jurisdictions where tax laws may apply to a Holder  this notice does not discuss the tax consequences for Holders arising from the purchase of Notes by the Issuer pursuant to the 2023 Put Option. Holders are urged to consult their own professional advisers regarding these possible tax consequences under the laws of the jurisdictions that apply to them or to the sale of their Notes and the receipt pursuant to the 2023 Put Option of the Repurchase Price. Holders are liable for their own taxes and have no recourse to the Issuer or the Settlement Agent with respect to taxes arising in connection with the 2023 Put Option.Compliance with applicable Sanctions laws and regulationsBy submitting a 2023 Put Option Election Notice in the manner specified above  the Holder represents and warrants to the Issuer and the Settlement Agent on the date of submission of the 2023 Put Option Election Notice and on each date until the Settlement Date that:(i) it (and any person acting for  on behalf of  or at the direction of or through it)  the person(s) having a substantial influence over it (and any person acting for  on behalf of  or at the direction of or through it) up to the ultimate beneficial owners  and each of their officers or directors (A) is not  and is not acting for or on behalf of  or at the direction of or through  a Sanctions Disqualified Person; and (B) has complied with all Sanctions in connection with the 2023 Put Option; (ii) it (and any person acting for  on behalf of  or at the direction of or through it) has submitted the 2023 Put Option Election Notice in compliance with Sanctions; and (iii) it (and any person acting for  on behalf of  or at the direction of or through it) has not taken or omitted to take any action in breach of Sanctions or which will or could result in the Issuer acting in breach of Sanctions in connection with the 2023 Put Option and the 2023 Put Option Election Notice; andit shall notify the Issuer (via the Settlement Agent) if at any time during the intervening period between the date of submission of its 2023 Put Option Election Notice and the Settlement Date if it would not be able to repeat the representations and warranties in paragraph (a) above.Holders who are not Sanctions Disqualified Persons  and are not acting for  on behalf of  or at the direction of or through Sanctions Disqualified Persons may submit a 2023 Put Option Election Notice and participate in the 2023 Put Option in respect of their relevant Series of Notes.

The deadlines set by any such intermediary and each Clearing System for the submission of 2023 Put Option Election Notices will be earlier than the Expiration Deadline specified in this notice. Submission of 2023 Put Option Election Notice Only a person who is shown in the records of the relevant Clearing System (a “Direct Participant”) may submit a 2023 Put Option Election Notice. Each Holder that is not a Direct Participant must arrange for the Direct Participant through which it holds the Notes to submit a 2023 Put Option Election Notice on its behalf to the relevant Clearing System before the deadlines specified by such Clearing System (which will be earlier than the deadlines specified in this notice) . The participation of Holders in the 2023 Put Option will be deemed to have occurred upon receipt by the Settlement Agent at or prior to the Expiration Deadline via the relevant Clearing System of a valid 2023 Put Option Election Notice submitted in accordance with the requirements of such Clearing System. The receipt of such 2023 Put Option Election Notice by the relevant Clearing System will be acknowledged in accordance with the standard practices of such Clearing System and will result in the blocking of the Notes in the Holder's account at the relevant Clearing System so that no transfers may be effected in relation to such Notes from the date the relevant 2023 Put Option Election Notice is submitted.1 Holders must take the appropriate steps through the relevant Clearing System so that no transfers may be effected in relation to such blocked Notes at any time after the date of submission of a 2023 Put Option Election Notice  in accordance with the requirements of the relevant Clearing System and the deadlines required by such Clearing System. By blocking Notes in the relevant Clearing System  each Direct Participant will be deemed to consent to have the relevant Clearing System provide details concerning such Direct Participant's identity to the Settlement Agent (and for the Settlement Agent to provide such details to the Issuer and its legal advisers). It is a term of the 2023 Put Option that 2023 Put Option Election Notices are irrevocable and no withdrawals are permitted. Procedures for Notes held through Euroclear and Clearstream  Luxembourg To participate Notes effectively in the 2023 Put Option  participants of Euroclear or Clearstream  Luxembourg  as the case may be  must electronically transmit their 2023 Put Option Election Notice via a message to Euroclear or Clearstream  Luxembourg  as the case may be  containing the following information: the event or reference number issued by Euroclear or Clearstream  Luxembourg; the name of the Direct Participant and the securities account number in which the Notes the Holder wishes to participate in the 2023 Put Option are held; the ISINs and Common Codes of such Notes; the principal amount of the Notes; and any other information as may be required by Euroclear or Clearstream  Luxembourg  and duly notified to the Holder prior to the submission of the 2023 Put Option Election Notice. In addition  each Holder must: cause Euroclear or Clearstream  Luxembourg  as the case may be  to block the position in such Notes in accordance with the procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream  Luxembourg  as the case may be; and instruct Euroclear or Clearstream  Luxembourg  as the case may be  to send the Settlement Agent an electronic message confirming: the Direct Participant's 2023 Put Option Election Notice; and that the position in such Notes has been blocked from trading pending settlement of the 2023 Put Option. Euroclear and Clearstream  Luxembourg will collect from the Direct Participants: instructions to: participate the Notes in the 2023 Put Option and deliver the acceptances held by them on behalf of their Direct Participants; and credit their accounts on the Settlement Date  in respect to all Notes in respect of which a 2023 Put Option Election Notice has been validly submitted; and irrevocable authorisation to disclose the name of the Direct Participants and information about the foregoing instructions to the Settlement Agent (and for the Settlement Agent to provide such details to the Issuer and its legal advisers). By participating in the 2023 Put Option in this manner  Holders will be deemed to have acknowledged that they have received this 2023 Put Event Notice and agree to be bound by the terms of this 2023 Put Event Notice and that the Issuer may enforce such agreement against such Holders. The 2023 Put Option Election Notices must be delivered to  and received by  Euroclear and Clearstream  Luxembourg in accordance with the relevant procedures and on or prior to the relevant deadline established by them. Holders are responsible for informing themselves of such deadlines and for arranging the due and timely delivery of 2023 Put Option Election Notice to Euroclear or Clearstream  Luxembourg. Holders should note that Euroclear and Clearstream  Luxembourg are not direct participants in DTC in respect of the Rule 144A Notes and 2023 Put Option Election Notices delivered to Euroclear and/or Clearstream  Luxembourg in respect of such Notes shall in turn be the subject of corresponding 2023 Put Option Election Notices from Euroclear and/or Clearstream  Luxembourg to DTC via their Direct Participants. Holders should ensure that they submit a 2023 Put Option Election Notice by such deadline as Euroclear and/or Clearstream  Luxembourg require to allow Euroclear and/or Clearstream  Luxembourg to provide corresponding 2023 Put Option Election Notices via their Direct Participants to DTC. Procedures for Notes held through DTC Any Holder who holds Notes through DTC must arrange for a Direct Participant in DTC to electronically transmit the Holder’s 2023 Put Option Election Notice through DTC’s Automated Tender Offer Program (ATOP)  for which the 2023 Put Option will be eligible. Accordingly  a DTC participant whose name appears on the security position listing as the Holder of the Notes must electronically transmit its acceptance of the 2023 Put Option by causing DTC to transfer Notes in the participant’s account to the Settlement Agent’s account at DTC in accordance with DTC’s ATOP procedures. DTC will then send an agent’s message (as hereinafter defined) to the Settlement Agent in respect of the Notes. An “agent’s message” is a message  transmitted by DTC  received by the Settlement Agent and forming part of the book-entry confirmation  which states that DTC has received an express acknowledgement from the participant that such participant has received this 2023 Put Option Event Notice and agrees to be bound by the terms of the 2023 Put Option  and that the Issuer may enforce the terms of the 2023 Put Option against such participant. Although transfer of the Notes to the Settlement Agent’s account at DTC may be effected through book-entry at DTC  an agent’s message must be transmitted by DTC and received by the Settlement Agent on or prior to the Expiration Deadline in order to validly tender Notes pursuant to the 2023 Put Option. Notes tendered through DTC’s ATOP system will be held to the order of the Settlement Agent until the Settlement Date. Holders who intend to participate their Notes in the 2023 Put Option on the date of the Expiration Deadline should allow sufficient time for completion of the ATOP procedures during the normal business hours of DTC on such date. All 2023 Put Option Election Notices submitted through DTC’s ATOP system must be submitted in accordance with the deadlines and procedures established by DTC and an agent’s message with respect to participation in the 2023 Put Option must be received by the Settlement Agent on or prior to the Expiration Deadline. There are no letters of transmittal or guaranteed delivery procedures for the 2023 Put Option. Holders who hold Notes through DTC must participate their Notes in the 2023 Put Option through DTC’s ATOP procedures. Tax consequences In view of the number of different jurisdictions where tax laws may apply to a Holder  this notice does not discuss the tax consequences for Holders arising from the purchase of Notes by the Issuer pursuant to the 2023 Put Option. Holders are urged to consult their own professional advisers regarding these possible tax consequences under the laws of the jurisdictions that apply to them or to the sale of their Notes and the receipt pursuant to the 2023 Put Option of the Repurchase Price. Holders are liable for their own taxes and have no recourse to the Issuer or the Settlement Agent with respect to taxes arising in connection with the 2023 Put Option. Compliance with applicable Sanctions laws and regulations By submitting a 2023 Put Option Election Notice in the manner specified above  the Holder represents and warrants to the Issuer and the Settlement Agent on the date of submission of the 2023 Put Option Election Notice and on each date until the Settlement Date that: (i) it (and any person acting for  on behalf of  or at the direction of or through it)  the person(s) having a substantial influence over it (and any person acting for  on behalf of  or at the direction of or through it) up to the ultimate beneficial owners  and each of their officers or directors (A) is not  and is not acting for or on behalf of  or at the direction of or through  a Sanctions Disqualified Person; and (B) has complied with all Sanctions in connection with the 2023 Put Option; (ii) it (and any person acting for  on behalf of  or at the direction of or through it) has submitted the 2023 Put Option Election Notice in compliance with Sanctions; and (iii) it (and any person acting for  on behalf of  or at the direction of or through it) has not taken or omitted to take any action in breach of Sanctions or which will or could result in the Issuer acting in breach of Sanctions in connection with the 2023 Put Option and the 2023 Put Option Election Notice; and it shall notify the Issuer (via the Settlement Agent) if at any time during the intervening period between the date of submission of its 2023 Put Option Election Notice and the Settlement Date if it would not be able to repeat the representations and warranties in paragraph (a) above. Holders who are not Sanctions Disqualified Persons  and are not acting for  on behalf of  or at the direction of or through Sanctions Disqualified Persons may submit a 2023 Put Option Election Notice and participate in the 2023 Put Option in respect of their relevant Series of Notes. Holders who are  or are acting for  on behalf of  at the direction of or through  Sanctions Disqualified Persons are not permitted to submit a 2023 Put Option Election Notice or participate in the 2023 Put Option. Repurchase of the Notes On the Settlement Date  the Issuer will  but only in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations  including Sanctions  purchase such Notes of Holders who have validly submitted a 2023 Put Option Election Notice. Such tendered Notes will be cancelled upon payment to the Holder of the Repurchase Price to the account specified by such Holder in their validly submitted 2023 Put Option Election Notice  provided that such account must not be held at or through a bank or custody account which is a Sanctioned Disqualified Person and must otherwise be in compliance with Sanctions. For the avoidance of doubt  the Issuer’s obligations to purchase Notes under the 2023 Put Option shall only arise with respect to Notes which are not held by Holders that are Sanctions Disqualified Persons and are not held through a Sanctions Disqualified Person  and only if such purchase is otherwise in compliance with Sanctions. 2023 Noteholders may contact the Settlement Agent via email at veon@is.kroll.com if they require assistance with any of the above.

The receipt of such 2023 Put Option Election Notice by the relevant Clearing System will be acknowledged in accordance with the standard practices of such Clearing System and will result in the blocking of the Notes in the Holder's account at the relevant Clearing System so that no transfers may be effected in relation to such Notes from the date the relevant 2023 Put Option Election Notice is submitted.1 Holders must take the appropriate steps through the relevant Clearing System so that no transfers may be effected in relation to such blocked Notes at any time after the date of submission of a 2023 Put Option Election Notice  in accordance with the requirements of the relevant Clearing System and the deadlines required by such Clearing System. By blocking Notes in the relevant Clearing System  each Direct Participant will be deemed to consent to have the relevant Clearing System provide details concerning such Direct Participant's identity to the Settlement Agent (and for the Settlement Agent to provide such details to the Issuer and its legal advisers). It is a term of the 2023 Put Option that 2023 Put Option Election Notices are irrevocable and no withdrawals are permitted. Procedures for Notes held through Euroclear and Clearstream  Luxembourg To participate Notes effectively in the 2023 Put Option  participants of Euroclear or Clearstream  Luxembourg  as the case may be  must electronically transmit their 2023 Put Option Election Notice via a message to Euroclear or Clearstream  Luxembourg  as the case may be  containing the following information: the event or reference number issued by Euroclear or Clearstream  Luxembourg; the name of the Direct Participant and the securities account number in which the Notes the Holder wishes to participate in the 2023 Put Option are held; the ISINs and Common Codes of such Notes; the principal amount of the Notes; and any other information as may be required by Euroclear or Clearstream  Luxembourg  and duly notified to the Holder prior to the submission of the 2023 Put Option Election Notice. In addition  each Holder must: cause Euroclear or Clearstream  Luxembourg  as the case may be  to block the position in such Notes in accordance with the procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream  Luxembourg  as the case may be; and instruct Euroclear or Clearstream  Luxembourg  as the case may be  to send the Settlement Agent an electronic message confirming: the Direct Participant's 2023 Put Option Election Notice; and that the position in such Notes has been blocked from trading pending settlement of the 2023 Put Option. Euroclear and Clearstream  Luxembourg will collect from the Direct Participants: instructions to: participate the Notes in the 2023 Put Option and deliver the acceptances held by them on behalf of their Direct Participants; and credit their accounts on the Settlement Date  in respect to all Notes in respect of which a 2023 Put Option Election Notice has been validly submitted; and irrevocable authorisation to disclose the name of the Direct Participants and information about the foregoing instructions to the Settlement Agent (and for the Settlement Agent to provide such details to the Issuer and its legal advisers). By participating in the 2023 Put Option in this manner  Holders will be deemed to have acknowledged that they have received this 2023 Put Event Notice and agree to be bound by the terms of this 2023 Put Event Notice and that the Issuer may enforce such agreement against such Holders. The 2023 Put Option Election Notices must be delivered to  and received by  Euroclear and Clearstream  Luxembourg in accordance with the relevant procedures and on or prior to the relevant deadline established by them. Holders are responsible for informing themselves of such deadlines and for arranging the due and timely delivery of 2023 Put Option Election Notice to Euroclear or Clearstream  Luxembourg. Holders should note that Euroclear and Clearstream  Luxembourg are not direct participants in DTC in respect of the Rule 144A Notes and 2023 Put Option Election Notices delivered to Euroclear and/or Clearstream  Luxembourg in respect of such Notes shall in turn be the subject of corresponding 2023 Put Option Election Notices from Euroclear and/or Clearstream  Luxembourg to DTC via their Direct Participants. Holders should ensure that they submit a 2023 Put Option Election Notice by such deadline as Euroclear and/or Clearstream  Luxembourg require to allow Euroclear and/or Clearstream  Luxembourg to provide corresponding 2023 Put Option Election Notices via their Direct Participants to DTC. Procedures for Notes held through DTC Any Holder who holds Notes through DTC must arrange for a Direct Participant in DTC to electronically transmit the Holder’s 2023 Put Option Election Notice through DTC’s Automated Tender Offer Program (ATOP)  for which the 2023 Put Option will be eligible. Accordingly  a DTC participant whose name appears on the security position listing as the Holder of the Notes must electronically transmit its acceptance of the 2023 Put Option by causing DTC to transfer Notes in the participant’s account to the Settlement Agent’s account at DTC in accordance with DTC’s ATOP procedures. DTC will then send an agent’s message (as hereinafter defined) to the Settlement Agent in respect of the Notes. An “agent’s message” is a message  transmitted by DTC  received by the Settlement Agent and forming part of the book-entry confirmation  which states that DTC has received an express acknowledgement from the participant that such participant has received this 2023 Put Option Event Notice and agrees to be bound by the terms of the 2023 Put Option  and that the Issuer may enforce the terms of the 2023 Put Option against such participant. Although transfer of the Notes to the Settlement Agent’s account at DTC may be effected through book-entry at DTC  an agent’s message must be transmitted by DTC and received by the Settlement Agent on or prior to the Expiration Deadline in order to validly tender Notes pursuant to the 2023 Put Option. Notes tendered through DTC’s ATOP system will be held to the order of the Settlement Agent until the Settlement Date. Holders who intend to participate their Notes in the 2023 Put Option on the date of the Expiration Deadline should allow sufficient time for completion of the ATOP procedures during the normal business hours of DTC on such date. All 2023 Put Option Election Notices submitted through DTC’s ATOP system must be submitted in accordance with the deadlines and procedures established by DTC and an agent’s message with respect to participation in the 2023 Put Option must be received by the Settlement Agent on or prior to the Expiration Deadline. There are no letters of transmittal or guaranteed delivery procedures for the 2023 Put Option. Holders who hold Notes through DTC must participate their Notes in the 2023 Put Option through DTC’s ATOP procedures. Tax consequences In view of the number of different jurisdictions where tax laws may apply to a Holder  this notice does not discuss the tax consequences for Holders arising from the purchase of Notes by the Issuer pursuant to the 2023 Put Option. Holders are urged to consult their own professional advisers regarding these possible tax consequences under the laws of the jurisdictions that apply to them or to the sale of their Notes and the receipt pursuant to the 2023 Put Option of the Repurchase Price. Holders are liable for their own taxes and have no recourse to the Issuer or the Settlement Agent with respect to taxes arising in connection with the 2023 Put Option. Compliance with applicable Sanctions laws and regulations By submitting a 2023 Put Option Election Notice in the manner specified above  the Holder represents and warrants to the Issuer and the Settlement Agent on the date of submission of the 2023 Put Option Election Notice and on each date until the Settlement Date that: (i) it (and any person acting for  on behalf of  or at the direction of or through it)  the person(s) having a substantial influence over it (and any person acting for  on behalf of  or at the direction of or through it) up to the ultimate beneficial owners  and each of their officers or directors (A) is not  and is not acting for or on behalf of  or at the direction of or through  a Sanctions Disqualified Person; and (B) has complied with all Sanctions in connection with the 2023 Put Option; (ii) it (and any person acting for  on behalf of  or at the direction of or through it) has submitted the 2023 Put Option Election Notice in compliance with Sanctions; and (iii) it (and any person acting for  on behalf of  or at the direction of or through it) has not taken or omitted to take any action in breach of Sanctions or which will or could result in the Issuer acting in breach of Sanctions in connection with the 2023 Put Option and the 2023 Put Option Election Notice; and it shall notify the Issuer (via the Settlement Agent) if at any time during the intervening period between the date of submission of its 2023 Put Option Election Notice and the Settlement Date if it would not be able to repeat the representations and warranties in paragraph (a) above. Holders who are not Sanctions Disqualified Persons  and are not acting for  on behalf of  or at the direction of or through Sanctions Disqualified Persons may submit a 2023 Put Option Election Notice and participate in the 2023 Put Option in respect of their relevant Series of Notes. Holders who are  or are acting for  on behalf of  at the direction of or through  Sanctions Disqualified Persons are not permitted to submit a 2023 Put Option Election Notice or participate in the 2023 Put Option. Repurchase of the Notes On the Settlement Date  the Issuer will  but only in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations  including Sanctions  purchase such Notes of Holders who have validly submitted a 2023 Put Option Election Notice. Such tendered Notes will be cancelled upon payment to the Holder of the Repurchase Price to the account specified by such Holder in their validly submitted 2023 Put Option Election Notice  provided that such account must not be held at or through a bank or custody account which is a Sanctioned Disqualified Person and must otherwise be in compliance with Sanctions. For the avoidance of doubt  the Issuer’s obligations to purchase Notes under the 2023 Put Option shall only arise with respect to Notes which are not held by Holders that are Sanctions Disqualified Persons and are not held through a Sanctions Disqualified Person  and only if such purchase is otherwise in compliance with Sanctions. 2023 Noteholders may contact the Settlement Agent via email at veon@is.kroll.com if they require assistance with any of the above.

Arnault is also the first person outside the US to surpass a net worth of $200 billion.Arnault derives his wealth from a 97.5% stake in the luxury fashion brand Christian Dior holding company that controls 41.4% of LVMH. His net worth increased by $2.4 billion on Tuesday  bringing the Frenchman's fortune to $201 billion  per Bloomberg's index.LVMH shares on the Euronext Paris stock exchange closed 0.8% higher at 851 euros  or $932.30  on Tuesday. The stock is up about 25% this year.A luxury boom is propping up Arnault's wealthThe French tycoon's net worth has doubled since the beginning of 2020 amid strong demand for luxury goods as consumers splurged on designer handbags and watches during pandemic lockdowns.This robust appetite for luxury goods is helping LVMH  which owns a range of luxury fashion brands including Louis Vuitton  Tiffany & Co.  and TAG Heuer. LVMH posted a 23% year-on-year growth in revenues as well as profits from recurring operations in 2022  according to the company's financials.Millennials and Gen Z are also driving growth in this market.

Sodexo’s bondholders and other lenders will be consulted on the proposed transaction in due course.Strong strategic RationaleBy separating the two businesses  Sodexo intends to accelerate value creation for all its stakeholders:As two pure players dedicated to their respective markets and clients  one in Food and Facilities Management services and the other in employee benefits and engagement  each would be strategically more focused;Empowered and dedicated governance would drive enhanced business and financial performance;Conducting each business independently would help create a focused workforce and optimize employer attractiveness and people retention through dedicated compensation mechanisms;Both companies would be established with the adequate capital structures providing them with the full financial flexibility to execute their growth strategies  including specific M&A.At separation  OSS and BRS would have capital structures consistent with a strong Investment Grade rating;Already operating vastly as an independent company  the spin-off and listing of BRS is not expected to generate any material adverse effects and would result in one-off costs customary for a transaction of this nature;The two differentiated investment profiles  with their respective business drivers  KPIs and stock market benchmarks would ensure that they attract the best suited investors.OutlookFirst half Fiscal 2023 was better than expected.

However  given the weight of the Benefit & Rewards activity in Brazil  and the high level of its margins relative to the Group  when the Brazilian real declines against the euro  it has a negative effect on the underlying operating profit margin due to a change in the mix of margins. Conversely  when the Brazilian real strengthens Group margins increase.1€ = AVERAGE RATEH1 FY 2023 AVERAGE RATEH1 FY 2022 AVERAGE RATEH1 FY 2023 VS.

Pricing and mitigation actions to offset cost inflation  leverage on the volume recovery  particularly in Corporate Services and Sports & Leisure  strict control of central costs  ongoing improvements in SKU management  attendance forecasting and labor scheduling  all contributed to the strong improvement  somewhat offset by mobilization costs in Healthcare.In Europe   the Underlying operating profit was up +6.7%  and the margin was stable at 3.9%. Cost inflation was offset by pricing and mitigation policies  except in some very specific sectors  such as Schools in certain countries  where pricing is still lagging cost inflation. Leverage on the post-Covid recovery in volumes as well as an increase in average spend per consumer  provided upside  somewhat offset by the impact of strikes in France and the loss of the Testing centers contract in the UK.Rest of the World Underlying operating profit was down -6.8% and the margin was down -50 bps at 3.5%. This temporary decline is due to a combination of delays in price increases and some significant mobilization costs after very strong development signed in the previous year. Profitability in China was also affected by zero-Covid measures.Benefits & Rewards Services Underlying operating profit was up +52.8%  and +46.4% excluding currency impacts. As a result  the margin was also up +530 bps at 31.9%.

Therefore  it corresponds to the Net Income Group share excluding Other Income and Expense and significant non-recurring elements in both Net Financial Expense and Income Tax Expense where relevant.Underlying Net profit per shareUnderlying Net profit per share presents the Underlying net profit divided by the average number of shares.Underlying operating profit marginThe underlying operating profit margin corresponds to Underlying operating profit divided by revenues.Underlying operating profit margin at constant ratesThe underlying operating profit margin at constant rates corresponds to Underlying operating profit divided by revenues  calculated by converting 2023 figures at Fiscal 2022 rates  except for countries with hyperinflationary economies.2First half Fiscal 2023 - Condensed consolidated financial statements1 Consolidated financial statements1.1 Consolidated income statement(in million euros) FIRST HALF FISCAL 2023 FIRST HALF FISCAL 2022 Revenues 12 085 10 262 Cost of sales (10 326) (8 792) Gross profit 1 759 1 470 Selling  General and Administrative costs (1 056) (934) Share of profit of companies accounted for using the equity method that directly contribute to the Group’s business 1 2 Underlying operating profit 704 538 Other operating income 1 67 Other operating expenses (43) (68) Operating profit 662 537 Financial income 39 10 Financial expenses (87) (63) Share of profit of other companies accounted for using the equity method — — Profit for the period before tax 614 484 Income tax expense (166) (136) Net profit for the period 448 348 Of which: Attributable to non-controlling interests 8 11 ATTRIBUTABLE TO EQUITY HOLDERS OF THE PARENT 440 337 Basic earnings per share (in euro) 3.01 2.30 Diluted earnings per share (in euro) 2.98 2.271.2 Consolidated statement of comprehensive income(in million euros) FIRST HALF FISCAL 2023 FIRST HALF FISCAL 2022 NET PROFIT FOR THE PERIOD 448 348 Components of other comprehensive income that may be reclassified subsequentlyto profit or loss (384) 235 Change in fair value of cash flow hedge instruments — — Change in fair value of cash flow hedge instruments reclassified to profit or loss — — Currency translation adjustment (385) 232 Currency translation adjustment reclassified to profit or loss — 1 Tax on components of other comprehensive income that may be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss — — Share of other components of comprehensive income (loss) of companies accounted for using the equity method  net of tax 1 2 Components of other comprehensive income that will not be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss 20 147 Remeasurement of defined benefit plan obligation (101) 104 Change in fair value of financial assets revalued through other comprehensive income 98 73 Tax on components of other comprehensive income that will not be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss 23 (30) TOTAL OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)  AFTER TAX FOR THE PERIOD (365) 381 Comprehensive income for the period 82 729 Of which: Attributable to equity holders of the parent 75 717 Attributable to non-controlling interests 7 121.3 Consolidated statement of financial positionAssets(in million euros) FEBRUARY 28  2023 AUGUST 31  2022 Goodwill 6 286 6 611 Other intangible assets 661 678 Property  plant and equipment 510 510 Right-of-use assets relating to leases 843 895 Client investments 676 667 Investments in companies accounted for using the equity method 72 73 Non-current financial assets 1 144 1 025 Other non-current assets 64 172 Deferred tax assets 160 154 NON CURRENT ASSETS 10 416 10 785 Current financial assets 62 57 Inventories 350 352 Income tax receivable 183 171 Trade and other receivables 5 641 5 068 Restricted cash and financial assets related to the Benefits & Rewards Services activity 1 218 1 257 Cash and cash equivalents 2 625 3 225 Assets held for sale(1) 76 5 CURRENT ASSETS 10 155 10 135 TOTAL ASSETS 20 571 20 920(1) As of February 28  2023  assets held for sale correspond to current and non-current assets of a non-strategic activity located in several countries  excluding the associated goodwill as the amount depends on the selling price  which is still being discussed  and its allocation by country.

headquarters located in Issy-les-Moulineaux.Sodexo’s condensed interim consolidated financial statements for the six-month period from September 1  2022  to February 28  2023  were approved by the Board of Directors on April 4  2023.The numbers shown in the tables were prepared in thousands of euros and are presented in million euros (unless otherwise indicated).Note 1.Significant events1 New On-site Services organizationAs announced in July 2022  the Group has reorganized its On-site Services activity with regions and countries consolidated into geographic zones led by three Zone Presidents  with the full responsibility of the Profit and Loss. The three geographic zones are North America  Europe and Rest of the World (including Asia-Pacific  Middle East  Africa  Latin America)In order to reflect the implementation of the new organization of On-site Services by geographic zone  fully effective from October 1  2022  the Group has redefined its operating segments as defined by IFRS 8 (corresponding until then to the global client segments and now represented by regions) and has updated its segment information accordingly. Thus  within On-site Services activity  the new operating segments after aggregation correspond to the following geographic zones:North America Europe (including the Continental Europe  France and United Kingdom & Ireland regions) Rest of the World (including Asia-Pacific/ Middle East/ Africa  Latin America (without Brazil) and Brazil).Benefits & Rewards Services  not impacted by the reorganization  is an operating segment on its own.For comparability purposes  the segment information of the previous period has been restated (see note 3.1).Furthermore  in accordance with IAS 36 ""Impairment of assets""  the reorganization of On-site Services activity has led the Group to reassess the level at which goodwill impairment tests are carried out. On-site Services goodwill have therefore been reallocated to each region (group of Cash Generating Units)  which corresponds to the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes (see note 4)  based on estimated relative value in use as of August 31  2022.Note 2.Basis of preparation of the financial statements1 Accounting policies1.1 General principlesThe condensed interim consolidated financial statements for the six months ended February 28  2023  have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 ""Interim Financial Reporting""  as published by the IASB and endorsed by the European Union. They do not include all the disclosures required for a complete set of annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the Sodexo Group for the fiscal year ended August 31  2022.The accounting policies applied by the Group in the condensed interim consolidated financial statements for the six months ended February 28  2023  are the same as those used in the annual consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended August 31  2022  with the exception of the specific requirements of IAS 34 (see note 2.2) and policies impacted by the reorganization of On-site Services (see notes 1.1  3.1 and 4). The texts effective as of September 1  2022  did not have a material impact on the interim consolidated financial statements of the Group.The Group has not applied any IFRSs that had not yet been approved by the European Union as of February 28  2023. The Group has not elected to early adopt any standards or interpretations whose application is not mandatory in Fiscal 2023.2 Specific interim reporting requirementsIncome tax expenseIncome tax expense (current and deferred) in the condensed interim consolidated financial statements is computed by applying an estimated average annual tax rate for the current fiscal year to each tax reporting entity's pre-tax profit for the first half of the year as adjusted  where applicable  for the tax effect of any specific events that may have occurred during the period. The resulting deferred tax charge or benefit is recognized in deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial position.Post-employment and other long-term employee benefitsThe expense for post-employment and other long-term employee benefits is computed as one half of the annual charge estimated as of August 31  2022. The actuarial projections are updated to take into account any material changes to assumptions or one-off impacts (discount rates  applicable legislation...) during the six-month period.3 Use of estimatesThe preparation of the condensed interim consolidated financial statements requires the management of Sodexo and its subsidiaries to make estimates and assumptions that may affect the amounts reported for assets  liabilities and contingent liabilities as of the date of preparation of the financial statements  and of revenues and expenses for the period.These estimates and judgments are updated continuously based on past experience and on various other factors considered reasonable in view of the situation prevailing as of February 28  2023 and are the basis for the assessments of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities.Final amounts may differ substantially from these estimates if assumptions or circumstances change.Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions are the same as those described in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended August 31  2022 (valuation of current and non-current assets  assessment of deferred tax assets recoverability  valuation of financial assets measured at fair value  provisions – including uncertain tax treatments – and litigations  assessment of the lease term in measuring the lease liabilities and related right-of-use assets  post-employment defined benefit plan assets and liabilities  and share-based payments).Note 3.Segment information and other operating items1 Segment information and revenue informationAccounting principles and policiesIn accordance with IFRS 8 “Operating segments”  the segment information presented below has been prepared based on internal management data as monitored since the first quarter of Fiscal 2023 by the Group Leadership Team  which is Sodexo’s chief operating decision-maker: On-site Services and Benefits & Rewards Services.For On-site Services  Revenue and Underlying operating profit are followed by regions. These regions meet the definition of operating segments in IFRS 8.Sodexo’s operating segments and groups of operating segments are as follows:On-site Services: North America  Europe  which includes the Continental Europe  France and United Kingdom & Ireland regions; Rest of the World  including Asia-Pacific/Middle East/Africa  Latin America (without Brazil) and Brazil);Benefits & Rewards Services. The operating segments that have been aggregated within the On-site Services activity carry out similar operations – both in terms of type of services rendered and processes and methods used to deliver the services – and have similar economic characteristics (notably in terms of margins they generate).Segment assets and liabilities are not presented as they are not included in the chief operating decision-maker’s measurement of segment performance.1.1 Segment informationFIRST HALF FISCAL 2023(in million euros) ON-SITE SERVICES NORTH AMERICA EUROPE REST OF THE WORLD BENEFITS & REWARDS SERVICES ELIMINATIONS AND CORPORATE EXPENSES GROUP TOTAL Revenues (third-party) 11 581 5 499 4 027 2 055 504 — 12 085 Inter-segment sales (Group) — — — — 4 (4) — TOTAL REVENUES 11 581 5 499 4 027 2 055 508 (4) 12 085 Underlying operating profit* 593 365 157 71 162 (51) 704* Including Group’s share of profit of companies accounted for using the equity method that directly contribute to the Group’s businessand excluding other operating income and expenses.FIRST HALF FISCAL 2022(in million euros) ON-SITE SERVICES NORTH AMERICA EUROPE REST OF THE WORLD BENEFITS & REWARDS SERVICES ELIMINATIONS AND CORPORATE EXPENSES GROUP TOTAL Revenues (third-party) 9 865 4 232 3 917 1 716 397 — 10 262 Inter-segment sales (Group) — — — — 1 (1) — TOTAL REVENUES 9 865 4 232 3 917 1 716 398 (1) 10 262 Underlying operating profit* 481 261 151 69 106 (50) 538* Including Group’s share of profit of companies accounted for using the equity method that directly contribute to the Group’s businessand excluding other operating income and expenses.1.2 Revenue by significant countryThe Group’s operations are spread across 53 countries  including two that each represent over 10% of consolidated revenues in First Half Fiscal 2023: France (the Group’s registration country) and the United States (as well as the United Kingdom during the comparative period).

The Group has also analyzed the evolution since August 31  2022  of the main financial parameters (discount rate).The Group’s management has concluded that there was no evidence of triggers indicating a decrease in the recoverable value of its operating segments as of February 28  2023  compared to August 31  2022. The annual review of the carrying amount of goodwill and other intangible assets will be realized during the Second Half Fiscal 2023.Note 5.Provisions  litigation  and contingent liabilities1 Provisions(in million euros) AUGUST 31  2022 INCREASES/CHARGES REVERSALS WITH UTILIZATION REVERSALS WITHOUT UTILIZATION CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTAND OTHER CHANGES IN SCOPE OF CONSOLIDATION FEBRUARY 28  2023 Employee claims and litigation 55 4 (4) (1) (1) — 53 Client/supplier claims and litigation 37 2 (4) (13) (1) — 21 Tax and social security exposures 32 — (1) — (1) — 30 Contract termination and loss-making contracts 21 1 (2) (2) (3) — 15 Reorganization costs 17 1 (5) — — — 12 Negative net assets of associates (1) 8 — — — 1 — 9 Other provisions 44 8 (4) (1) 1 — 48 TOTAL PROVISIONS 214 16 (20) (17) (4) — 188(1) Investments in companies accounted for using the equity method that have negative net assets.2 Litigation and contingent liabilitiesDisputes with the Brazilian tax authoritiesThe subsidiary Sodexo Pass do Brasil was in dispute with the Brazilian tax authorities regarding the tax deductibility of the amortization of goodwill recognized on the acquisition of VR in March 2008.As a reminder  in Fiscal 2017  Sodexo Pass do Brasil received a tax reassessment notice for fiscal years 2010 to 2012 challenging the deductibility for tax purposes of the goodwill amortization  with 150% penalties and late payment interest. The reassessment amounted to 573 million Brazilian real  i.e.  111 million euros as of August 31  2022 (29 million euros in principle  43 million euros in penalties and 40 million euros in late payment interest).The Group firmly disputed this reassessment  which the Brazilian tax authorities originally envisaged during a previous tax audit covering the fiscal years 2008 and 2009 but then abandoned  as it considered that the tax amortization of goodwill was valid  and that the procedure therefore had a strong chance of succeeding in its favor.This dispute was decided on August 14  2018  before the competent administrative court (CARF). The court ruled in favor of Sodexo Pass do Brasil  considering that the goodwill and corresponding tax amortization were legitimately recognized on the acquisition of VR. This ruling in favor of Sodexo Pass do Brasil was confirmed by the Superior Court of Appeal (CSRF) at a hearing on September 13  2022 and notified in writing to the Group on October 27  2022. The Federal Tax Administration has already taken note of the decision  without expressing any request for clarification  thus definitively ending the dispute in favor of Sodexo Pass do Brasil.During Fiscal 2021  the subsidiary Sodexo do Brasil Comercial also received a tax reassessment notice mainly linked to the tax deductibility of the amortization of goodwill recognized on the purchase of Puras. The reassessment covers the period from 2015 to 2017 and amounts to 205 million Brazilian real to date  i.e.  37 million euros as of February 28  2023 (of which 9 million euros in principal and 28 million euros in penalties and late payment interests). In August 2021  the competent administrative Court ruled in favor of Sodexo do Brasil Comercial but the Brazilian tax authorities appealed this first instance decision. However  the Group considers that the risks of a change in the decision are low  considering  on the one hand  that it has strong arguments to contest the tax reassessment and  on the other hand  the recent favorable decision of the CSRF ending the dispute between Sodexo Pass do Brasil and the Brazilian tax authorities on the same issue mentioned above.The goodwill amount has been fully amortized. The tax savings generated by this tax depreciation were offset in the consolidated accounts of the Group by a deferred tax expense of the same amount for each of the related financial periods  in accordance with the IFRS rules. The balance of the related deferred tax liability amounts to 26 million euros as of February 28  2023.In addition  Sodexo and its main competitors have a different interpretation from that of the Brazilian tax administration on the deductibility of PIS/COFINS on certain purchases made at a zero rate. Several proceedings are underway  either at the initiative of the tax authorities  which have notified Sodexo do Brasil Comercial of an adjustment in respect of credits recognized in 2016 of 9 million euro (including penalties and interest for late payment)  or at the initiative of the company  which has filed several claims in the courts. One of these proceedings initiated by Sodexo do Brasil Comercial was suspended  on the initiative of the judge  until the Supreme Court's decision on another company's case. In February 2023  the Supreme Court issued its decision  which was unfavorable to the company concerned: the judges essentially ruled that ordinary law may provide for limitations on the use of PIS/COFINS credits  provided that such law respects all constitutional principles  in particular equality of treatment of taxpayers and free competition. This decision  which should not be considered automatically unfavorable for the individual cases of each taxpayer  does not affect the appeals filed by Sodexo  which will continue to follow their respective courses. The company believes that it has different and strong enough arguments to ultimately succeed in court on this issue. After consultation with its advisors  Sodexo considers that its chances of success in these proceedings are good and that to date the risk of an outflow of resources associated with the PIS/COFINS credits deducted since 2016 remains unlikely; therefore  no provision has been recorded in the consolidated financial statements as of February 28  2023.Dispute with the French competition authorityOn October 9  2015  the company Octoplus filed a complaint with the French Competition Authority (Autorité de la concurrence) concerning several French meal voucher issuers  including Sodexo Pass France. Following the hearing of the parties concerned in April and July 2016  the Competition Authority decided on October 6  2016  to continue the proceedings  without ordering interim measures against Sodexo Pass France.On February 27  2019  the prosecution services sent their final investigation report to Sodexo Pass France. In its response filed on April 29  2019  the Group contested both of the grievances notified by the Authority (exchange of information and foreclosure of the meal voucher market through the Centrale de Règlement des Titres). On December 17  2019  the French Competition Authority ruled against the meal voucher issuers and fined Sodexo Pass France  jointly and severally with Sodexo S.A.  126 million euros. This decision was formally notified to Sodexo Pass France and Sodexo S.A. on February 6  2020. Sodexo vigorously contests this decision considering that it demonstrates a flawed understanding of the practices in question and of the way in which the market operates. The Group has therefore lodged an appeal against the decision with the Paris Court of Appeal. The hearing was held on November 18  2021  and the Court of Appeal is expected to render its decision on May 25  2023.Given the significant impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the Group's activities and performance  Sodexo obtained a decision from the State collection services allowing it to defer payment of the fine until December 15  2021  without any penalty being due  subject to providing a bank guarantee  and from that date a monthly settlement plan until January 2023. An asset was recognized in ""Other operating receivables "" as a counterpart of the sums paid.After consultation with its legal advisers  the Group considers that it has solid arguments capable of resulting in the reversal or revision of the decision of the Competition Authority. As a result  no provision has been made for this dispute.French tax reassessmentSodexo S.A. received in December 2021 a notification for a proposed tax reassessment concerning fiscal years 2016  2017 and 2018. Another proposed adjustment notice was issued by the French tax authorities in December 2022 for fiscal years 2019  2020 and 2021 in order to replicate certain adjustments it had initiated during the previous tax audit.The Company has assessed the risk associated with these procedures and  after review with its tax advisors  considers that it has strong arguments to contest the proposed reassessments.Other disputesGroup subsidiaries can also be subject to tax audits certain of which may result in reassessments. Main disputes are described above. In each case  the risk is assessed by management and its advisors  and any charges deemed probable are recorded as provisions or tax liabilities.The Group is not aware of any other governmental  judicial  or arbitral proceedings which are outstanding or threatened and which may have  or have had in the past 12 months  material effects on the Group’s financial position or profitability.Sodexo is also involved in other legal proceedings arising in the normal course of its business. The Group does not anticipate that any potential related liabilities will in the aggregate be material to its activities or to its consolidated financial position.Note 6.Equity and earnings per share1 Equity1.1 Statement of changes in shareholders’ equityComposition of share capital and treasury shares(number of shares) FEBRUARY 28  2023 AUGUST 31  2022 Share Capital (1) 147 454 887 147 454 887 Treasury shares (2) 1 473 046 841 102 Outstanding shares 145 981 841 146 613 785(1) With a par value of 4 euros each.(2) Treasury shares value of 131 million euros as of February 28  2023 (74 million euros as of August 31  2022).DividendsFIRST HALF FISCAL 2023 FIRST HALF FISCAL 2022 Dividends paid (in million euros) 352 294 Dividend per share paid (in euros) 2.40 2.002 Earnings per shareThe table below presents the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share:FIRST HALF FISCAL 2023 FIRST HALF FISCAL 2022 Profit for the year attributable to equity holders of the parent (in million euros) 440 337 Basic weighted average number of shares 146 147 666 146 292 627 Basic earnings per share (1) (in euros) 3.01 2.30 Average dilutive effect of free share plans 1 577 120 2 141 092 Diluted weighted average number of shares 147 724 786 148 433 719 Diluted earnings per share (1) (in euros) 2.98 2.27(1) Basic and diluted earnings per share do not reflect the effect of the dividend premium to be paid on certain registered shares.Note 7.Cash and cash equivalents  financial assets and liabilities  and financial income and expense1 Financial income and expense(in million euros) FIRST HALF FISCAL 2023 FIRST HALF FISCAL 2022 Gross borrowing cost (1) (70) (43) Interest income from short-term bank deposits and equivalent 32 2 NET BORROWING COST (38) (41) Interest on financial lease liabilities IFRS 16(2) (9) (9) Net foreign exchange gains/(losses) — 1 Net interest cost on net defined benefit plan obligation 1 (1) Interest income from loans and receivables at amortized cost 3 3 Other financial income 4 6 Other financial expense (9) (12) NET FINANCIAL EXPENSE (48) (53) Of which Financial income 39 10 Of which Financial expense (87) (63)(1) Gross borrowing cost represents interest expense on financial liabilities at amortized cost and interest expense on hedging instruments.(2) Interest on lease liabilities recognized in accordance with IFRS 16.2 Cash and cash equivalents(in million euros) FEBRUARY 28  2023 AUGUST 31  2022 Marketable securities 580 524 Cash* 2 045 2 701 CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS 2 625 3 225 Bank overdrafts (12) (8) CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS NET OF BANK OVERDRAFTS 2 613 3 217* Including 11 million euros allocated to the liquidity contract signed with an investment services provider  which complies with the Code of conduct drawn upby the French financial markets association (Association française des arches financiers – AMAFI) and approved by the French securities regulator(Autorité des marchés financiers – AMF)  for the purpose of improving the liquidity of Sodexo shares and the regularity of the quotations.Marketable securities comprised:Chart also available on https://www.sodexo.com/en/investors/financial-results-and-publications/financial-results - Sodexo H1 Results FY23 - Slide n° 473 Financial assetsPrincipal investments in non-consolidated companiesMeasurement of Bellon SA SecuritiesThe Group holds  through its wholly owned subsidiary Sofinsod  a 19.61% stake in Bellon SA  a company that controls Sodexo SA with 42.75% of its shares and 57.5% of its voting rights exercisable on February 28  2023. This shareholding does not give the Group significant influence over Bellon SA  as voting rights attached to Bellon SA shares cannot be exercised by Sofinsod  in accordance with the provisions of Article L. 233-31 of Code de Commerce.There are no potential conflicts of interest between the duties to Sodexo of members of the Board of Directors or senior management and their private interests. In particular the Pierre and Danielle Bellon Family controls 72.6% of the family holding company Bellon SA. Mr. and Mrs. Pierre Bellon and their children entered into an agreement in June 2015 to prevent their direct descendants from freely disposing of their Bellon SA shares for 50 years. Bellon SA’s only asset is its holding in Sodexo; Bellon SA has no intention of selling this holding to a third party.In accordance with IFRS 9  this investment is measured at its fair value  determined in accordance with IFRS 13. The valuation of the fair value of the investment depends  among other things  on the revalued net asset value (NAV) of Bellon SA which has limited debt and holds no assets other than shares of Sodexo S.A. These shares are valued at their closing share price for the calculation of the NAV of Bellon SA. Furthermore  the valuation method used by management (Level 3 of the hierarchy defined by IFRS 13) incorporates the illiquidity implied by the characteristics of the holding's ownership structure (discount to net asset value of Bellon SA estimated at 40% as of February 28  2023  and August 31  2022).As of February 28  2023  the fair value of the investment is assessed at 642 million euros (541 million euros as of August 31  2022)  and its change since the opening of the period has been recorded in other non-recyclable items of comprehensive income (OCI).Restricted cash and financial assets related to the benefits & rewards services activityRestricted cash corresponds to 843 million euros of “Financial assets related to the Benefits & Rewards Services activity” primarily in funds set aside to comply with regulations governing the issuance of service vouchers in France (267 million euros)  Romania (153 million euros)  Belgium (153 million euros)  India (122 million euros) and China (72 million euros). The funds remain the property of the Group but are subject to restrictions on their use. They may not be used for any purpose other than to reimburse affiliates and must be kept separate from the Group’s unrestricted cash. Restricted cash is invested in interest-bearing instruments.4 BorrowingsChanges in borrowings during First Half Fiscal 2023 were as follows:(in million euros) AUGUST 31  2022 INCREASES REPAYMENTS DISCOUNTING EFFECTSAND OTHER CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT CHANGES IN SCOPE OF CONSOLIDATION FEBRUARY 28  2023 Bond issues (1) 5 600 40 (16) (9) (77) — 5 538 Commercial paper and bank borrowings (2) 1 250 (252) — — 2 1 Other borrowings 108 — (5) — (3) 21 120 TOTAL BORROWINGS EXCLUDING DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 5 709 290 (273) (9) (80) 23 5 659 Net fair value of derivative financial instruments 33 3 1 10 (7) — 40 TOTAL BORROWINGS 5 742 293 (272) 1 (87) 23 5 699(1) As of February 28  2023  accrued interest on bond issues represented 34 million euros (13 million euros as of August 31  2022).(2) Commercial paper was drawn short term in First Half Fiscal 2023 but all was fully repaid by February 28  2023.Chart also available on https://www.sodexo.com/en/investors/financial-results-and-publications/financial-results - Sodexo H1 Results FY23 - Slide n° 44In order to comply with the Group’s financing policy  substantially all borrowings are long term and at fixed interest rates.As of February 28  2023  95% of the Group’s borrowings were at fixed rate. The average rate of interest as of the same date was 1.6%.As of August 31  2022  96% of the Group’s borrowings were at fixed rate. The average rate of interest as of the same date was 1.6%.The bond issues and borrowings from financial institutions described above include customary early redemption clauses. These clauses include cross-default and change-in-control clauses which apply to all of the borrowings.None of the bond issues have a financial covenant.July 2011 multicurrency confirmed credit facilityOn July 18  2011  Sodexo S.A. contracted a multicurrency credit facility for a maximum of 600 million euros plus 800 million U.S. dollars  with an original maturity date of July 18  2016. This facility has been amended on a number of occasions with the most recent amendment being in July 2019 with a new maturity date of July 2024  with two options to extend the maturity by one year each  up to July 2026. The first option to extend this facility was executed during Fiscal 2020 and the second was executed during Fiscal 2021. The facility maturity date is now July 2026. The maximum available limits under this facility now are 589 million euros plus 785 million U.S. dollars.The most recent amendment also incorporates an updated sustainability clause that links the credit facility cost to Sodexo’s ability to comply with its public commitment to reduce its food waste by 50% by 2025 and also an update to the referenced indices.Amounts drawn on this facility carry floating interest indexed on the SOFR  SONIA  ESTR and EURIBOR rates. This credit facility is not subject to any covenant.Concerning the benchmark rate reform  the Group is finalizing the discussions with their counterparts to negotiate the change of the rates  which include essentially this multilateral credit facility.No amounts had been drawn down on the facility as of either February 28  2023  nor as of August 31  2022.Bilateral confirmed credit facilityOn December 18  2019  the Group obtained two 150 million euros bilateral confirmed credit facility  both are due to expire in December 2023.On February 13  2020  the Group obtained a third 150 million euros bilateral confirmed credit facility expiring in February 2024.No amounts had been drawn down on any of these facilities as of either February 28  2023  nor as of August 31  2022.Commercial papersBorrowings under the Sodexo S.A. and Sodexo Finance commercial paper programs are nil either as of February 28  2023  nor of August 31  2022.Note 8.Other information1 Income taxThe 28.3% effective tax rate for First Half Fiscal 2022 decreased to 27.1% in First Half Fiscal 2023. The decrease in the effective tax rate is explained in particular by the decrease in the CVAE rate in France  the absence of non-recurring items with tax impact and the strong increase in the Group's pre-tax income compared to First Half Fiscal 2022 (613 million euros vs 484 million euros) which reduces the weight of negative impacts.2 Free share grantsOn January 31  2023  the Board of Directors decided to grant free shares to certain Group employees. The shares granted under this plan will only vest if the beneficiaries are still working for the Group on the vesting date and some are subject to a performance condition. The shares granted under this plan sum up to 826 148 shares. The impact of this plan for the first semester is not material.3 Members of the Board of Directors and the Leadership TeamThere were no significant changes from the fiscal year ended August 31  2022  in relation to the nature of compensation  advances and commitments for pensions or similar benefits granted to members of Sodexo's Board of Directors or Leadership Team.4 Related parties’ informationNon-consolidated companiesTransactions with non-consolidated companies are similar in nature to those described in note 14.3  ""Related parties"" to the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended August 31  2022.Principal shareholderAs of February 28  2023  Bellon SA held 42.75% of the capital of Sodexo and 57.5% of the exercisable voting rights.The expense recognized in First Half Fiscal 2023 under an assistance and advisory services contract between Bellon SA and Sodexo S.A. amounts to 2.3 million euros (1.9 million euros in First Half Fiscal 2022).Sodexo S.A. paid to Bellon SA 151 million euros of dividends.The Group didn't receive any dividends from Bellon SA in First Half Fiscal 2023. They will be paid in the second semester.5 Subsequent eventsThe Sodexo Board of Directors has unanimously approved the project to separate the two business units of Sodexo by spinning-off and listing BRS through the distribution of BRS shares to Sodexo shareholders.The contemplated transaction is expected to take place during 2024 following the completion of several customary steps  including consultation of the employee representative bodies  and remains subject to market conditions.Detailed transaction terms will be presented at a later stage and submitted to the approval of Sodexo’s shareholders at an extraordinary shareholders’ meeting. Sodexo’s bondholders and other lenders will be consulted on the proposed transaction in due course.6 Changes in principal currency exchange ratesThe following table presents changes in exchange rates for the main currencies used to convert the financial statements of subsidiaries compared with the first half of the prior fiscal year:Currency CLOSING RATEAS OF FEBRUARY 28  2023 AVERAGE RATEFOR FIRST HALF FISCAL 2023 CLOSING RATEAS OF AUGUST 31  2022 CLOSING RATEAS OF FEBRUARY 28  2022 AVERAGE RATEFOR FIRST HALF FISCAL 2022 DOLLAR (USD) 1.062 1.031 1.000 1.120 1.143 LIVRE (GBP) 0.877 0.874 0.860 0.836 0.846 REAL (BRL) 5.528 5.417 5.148 5.783 6.2583Statutory auditors' reportKPMG S.A.Tour Eqho2  avenue GambettaCS 6005592066 Paris-La Défense CedexS.A. au capital de € 5 497 100775 726 417 R.C.S.

On a like-for-like basis  growth reached +5%.The share of proprietary products in the core business increased at 18% of sales  compared to 14% in 2021.In 2022  the COVID business represented only 39% of consolidated sales (compared to 56% in 2021)  in a market undergoing a sharp drop in sales prices and volumes. During the second half  the share of COVID activities fell to 27% of sales.Gross margin reached 46.7% of sales compared to 55.5% in 2021. This decrease is mainly linked to the decline of the COVID activity and to exceptional depreciations made on COVID products inventory in the context of the end of the pandemic. Excluding these exceptional depreciations  gross margin reached 50% of sales.Structuring staff to develop the activity in new marketsResearch and Development efforts are continuing  notably through the purchase of new fixed-asset equipment (for more than €0.7 million in France) and stable expenses. Marketing and sales expenses increased by €2.5 million  mainly due to an increase in payroll costs linked to the structuring and development of the activity in new markets  as well as the increase in the consolidation scope. G&A expenses rose by €4.0 million  directly related to bank fees related to new loans and to costs related to the M&A activity  which was particularly important in 2022. At December 31  2022  operating expenses therefore increased by €6.6 million and EBITDA reached €40.5 million compared to €77.9 million at December 31  2021. Operating profit reached €36.8 million.With financial expenses under control  the financial result was negative at €-0.5 million  mainly due to the loan to finance M&A activities.The exceptional result is negative at €-0.7 million  mainly due to provisions for litigation and the costs of closing the Chilly-Mazarin site.Excluding amortization of goodwill for €6 million  net result amounted to €30.8 million at December 31  2022.€43m of cash generated by operationsWith a reduction in working capital of €8.8 million due to the decline in the COVID business and an improvement in customer payment recovery  Eurobio Scientific generated €43.1 million of cash from operations in 2022 (€65.9 million in 2021).As a result of the acquisitions completed in 2022  net cash flow from investments was €-141.8 million and net cash flow from financing activities was €82.3 million due to the new loan.As a result  Eurobio Scientific showed a cash position of €86 million at December 31  2022  for a financial debt of €108 million  i.e. a net financial debt of €22 million  leaving its investment capacity intact for the coming years.Accelerated strategic deploymentWhile the COVID business is rapidly declining  Eurobio Scientific has emerged from this exceptional period considerably strengthened  with key milestones achieved in all its strategic areas.In the core business  excluding COVID :revenues increased by 58% in 3 years  representing an annual growth rate of 16.5%;the share of international sales reached 25%;the share of proprietary products reached 18%;new market segments have been opened up  both through acquisitions and strengthened R&D.As a result of completed acquisitions that brought many synergies  both commercial and technological  these trends should continue in the years to come.Next financial meetingAnnual shareholders’ meeting : June 12  2023 at 9amAbout Eurobio ScientificEurobio Scientific is a key player in the field of specialty in vitro diagnostics.

Sodexo’s bondholders and other lenders will be consulted on the proposed transaction in due course.Strong strategic RationaleBy separating the two businesses  Sodexo intends to accelerate value creation for all its stakeholders:As two pure players dedicated to their respective markets and clients  one in Food and Facilities Management services and the other in employee benefits and engagement  each would be strategically more focused;Empowered and dedicated governance would drive enhanced business and financial performance;Conducting each business independently would help create a focused workforce and optimize employer attractiveness and people retention through dedicated compensation mechanisms;Both companies would be established with the adequate capital structures providing them with the full financial flexibility to execute their growth strategies  including specific M&A.At separation  OSS and BRS would have capital structures consistent with a strong Investment Grade rating;At separation  OSS and BRS would have capital structures consistent with a strong Investment Grade rating; Already operating vastly as an independent company  the spin-off and listing of BRS is not expected to generate any material adverse effects and would result in one-off costs customary for a transaction of this nature;The two differentiated investment profiles  with their respective business drivers  KPIs and stock market benchmarks would ensure that they attract the best suited investors.OutlookFirst half Fiscal 2023 was better than expected.

However  given the weight of the Benefit & Rewards activity in Brazil  and the high level of its margins relative to the Group  when the Brazilian real declines against the euro  it has a negative effect on the underlying operating profit margin due to a change in the mix of margins. Conversely  when the Brazilian real strengthens Group margins increase.1€ = AVERAGE RATEH1 FY 2023 AVERAGE RATEH1 FY 2022 AVERAGE RATEH1 FY 2023 VS.

Underlying net profit adjusted for Other Operating income and expenses net of tax amounted to 475 million euros  compared to 339 million euros in the previous year  up +40.1%.2.6 Earnings per sharePublished First half Fiscal 2023 EPS was 3.01 euros against 2.30 euros in the previous year. The weighted average number of shares for Fiscal 2023 was more or less stable at 146 147 666 compared to 146 292 627 shares for First half Fiscal 2022.Underlying EPS amounted to 3.25 euros  up +40.0% compared to the previous year.3 Consolidated financial position3.1 Cash flowsCash flows for the period were as follows:(in million euros) H1 FISCAL 2023 H1 FISCAL 2022 Operating cash flow 808 674 Change in working capital excluding change in BRS financial assets (1) (517) (481) IFRS 16 outflow (103) (109) Net capital expenditure (234) (159) Free cash flow (2) (46) (75) Net acquisitions (7) (26) Share buy-backs (57) (13) Dividends paid to shareholders (352) (294) Other changes (including scope and exchange rates) (139) (156) (Increase)/decrease in net debt (601) (564)(1) Excluding change in financial assets related to the Benefits & Rewards Services activity of 7 million euros in First half Fiscal 2023 versus 67 million euros in First half Fiscal 2022.Total change in working capital as reported in consolidated accounts:in First half Fiscal 2023: -510 million euros = -517 million euros + 7 million eurosand in First half Fiscal 2022: -414 million euros = - 481 million euros + 67 million euros.(2) The Group does not believe the accounting treatment introduced by IFRS 16 modifies the operating nature of its lease transactions. Accordingly  to ensure the Group’s performance measures continue to best reflect its operating performance  the Group considers repayments of lease liabilities as operating items impacting the Free cash flow  which integrates all lease payments (fixed or variable).To be consistent  the lease liabilities are not included in Net debt (treated as operating items).First half Fiscal 2023 Free cash outflow was 46 million euros against an outflow of 75 million euros in the previous period.First half Fiscal 2023 Operating cash flow improved to 808 million euros against 674 million euros in the previous period as a result of the significant improvement in the operating profit of the Group. The working capital outflow was similar to the previous year  at 517 million euros compared to an outflow of 481 million euros during First half Fiscal 2022.Net capital expenditure increased +47% to 234 million euros  representing 1.9% of revenues against 1.5% in the previous year. Gross capex was 317 million euros  up +43%  representing 2.6% of revenues. On-Site Services gross capex amounted to 264 million euros  or 2.3% of revenues  of which more than 85% was client facing. More than 85% of Benefits & Rewards gross capex was focused on IT & Data to reinforce its IT architecture and consumer and client platforms  amounting to 53 million euros  or 10.4% of revenues.M&A activity was limited in the First half Fiscal 2023. Acquisitions net of disposals amounted to 7 million euros.The Fiscal 2022 dividend payment resulted in an outflow of 352 million euros compared to 294 million euros in the previous year  reflecting the 20% increase in the dividend per share.After taking into account Other changes  consolidated net debt increased by 601 million euros during the First half to reach 1 868 million euros at February 28  2023.3.2 Acquisitions and disposals for the periodFirst half Fiscal 2023 has been a quiet period for both acquisitions and disposals of non-core activities and geographies.Overall acquisitions net of disposals amounted to 7 million euros.3.3 Condensed consolidated statement of financial positionat February 28  2023(in million euros) FEBRUARY 28  2023 FEBRUARY 28  2022 (in million euros) FEBRUARY 28  2023 FEBRUARY 28  2022 Non-current assets 10 416 10 063 Shareholders’ equity 4 096 3 615 Current assets excluding cash 6 312 5 980 Non-controlling interests 4 10 Restricted cashBenefits & Rewards 843 782 Non-current liabilities 6 637 7 129 Financial assetsBenefits & Rewards 375 221 Current liabilities 9 834 8 899 Cash 2 625 2 607 TOTAL ASSETS 20 571 19 653 TOTAL LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY 20 571 19 653 Borrowings 5 699 5 647 Net debt 1 868 2 042 Gearing 46% 56% Net debt ratio 1.3 1.8The increase in shareholders’ equity was due to several factors: the currency translation adjustment of some currencies such as the US dollar and the Brazilian real and the remeasurement of defined benefit plan obligations  as well as the revaluation of financial assets under IFRS 9.As of February 28  2023  net debt was 1 868 million euros  representing a gearing of 46%  and a net debt ratio of 1.3x  firmly within the target range of between 1x and 2x  and down from the same period last year.Gross borrowings were more or less stable during First half Fiscal 2023 and compared to the end of First half Fiscal 2022 at 5.7 billion euros  of which 95% is at fixed rates and 21% is dollar-denominated  with an average maturity of 4.2 years and 100% covenant-free. The blended cost of debt at the end of the period is 1.7% against 1.6% a year ago.Operating cash reached a total of 3 831 million euros  including 843 million euros of restricted cash and 375 million euros of financial assets of Benefits & Rewards Services.The Benefits & Rewards Services activity asset to liability coverage is at 123% compared to 121% as at February 28  2022  with operating cash of 2 871 million euros and client receivables of 1 702 million euros  compared to voucher liabilities payable of 3 707 million euros.The rest of the Group also had a significant operating cash position of 960 million euros.At the end of the First half  the Group had unused credit lines totaled 1.8 billion euros.3.4 Subsequent eventsThe Sodexo Board of Directors has unanimously approved the project to separate the two business units of Sodexo by spinning-off and listing BRS through the distribution of BRS shares to Sodexo shareholders.The contemplated transaction is expected to take place during 2024 following the completion of several customary steps  including consultation of the employee representative bodies  and remains subject to market conditions.Detailed transaction terms will be presented at a later stage and submitted to the approval of Sodexo’s shareholders at an extraordinary shareholders’ meeting. Sodexo’s bondholders and other lenders will be consulted on the proposed transaction in due course.3.5 OutlookFirst half Fiscal 2023 was better than expected. As a result  Fiscal 2023 guidance for the Group and Benefits & Rewards Services has been revised up slightly.Group Fiscal 2023 guidance upgraded on organic growth:Fiscal 2023 Organic revenue growth now expected close to +11%  driven by higher-than-expected growth in H1 and price increases to remain above 5% in H2Fiscal 2023 Underlying operating profit margin confirmed to be close to 5.5%  at constant ratesBenefits & Rewards Services Fiscal 2023 guidance upgraded on both organic growth and Underlying operating profit margin:Fiscal 2023 Organic revenue growth expected close to +20%Fiscal 2023 Underlying operating profit margin expected close to 32%  at constant ratesGroup and Benefits & Rewards Services Fiscal 2024 and 2025 guidance reiterated:Group: +6 to +8% organic revenue growth and an Underlying operating profit margin above 6% at constant rates in FY2025Benefits & Rewards Services: low double-digit organic revenue growth and an Underlying operating profit well above 30% at constant rates in FY20253.6 Alternative Performance Measure definitionsBlended cost of debtThe blended cost of debt is calculated at period end and is the weighted blended financing rate on borrowings (including derivative financial instruments and commercial papers) and cash pooling balances at period end.Financial ratios definitionFIRST HALF FISCAL 2023 FIRST HALF FISCAL 2022 Gearing ratioBorrowings (1) – operating cash (2) 45.6%56.3%Shareholders’ equity and non-controlling interests Net debt ratioBorrowings (1) – operating cash (2) 1.31.8Rolling 12-month Underlying EBITDA(underlying operating profit before Interest  Taxes  Depreciation and Amortization) (3)Financial ratios reconciliationFIRST HALF FISCAL 2023 FIRST HALF FISCAL 2022 (1) BorrowingsLong-term borrowings 5 132 5 601 + Short-term borrowings 569 55 - Derivative financial instruments recognized as assets (2) (9) BORROWINGS 5 699 5 647 (2) Operating cashCash and cash equivalents 2 625 2 607 + Restricted cash and financial assetsrelated to the Benefits & Rewards Services activity 1 218 1 003 - Bank overdrafts (12) (5) OPERATING CASH 3 831 3 605 (3) Underlying EBITDAUnderlying operating profit 1 226 851 + Depreciation and amortization 479 514 - Lease payments (216) (244) ROLLING 12-MONTH UNDERLYING EBITDA(UNDERLYING OPERATING PROFITBEFORE DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION) 1 489 1 121Free cash flowPlease refer to the section entitled Consolidated financial position.Growth excluding currency effectThe currency effect is determined by applying the previous year’s average exchange rates to the current year figures except in hyper-inflationary economies where all figures are converted at the latest closing rate for both periods when the impact is significant.Issue volumeIssue volume corresponds to the total face value of service vouchers  cards and digitally delivered services issued by Benefits & Rewards Services for beneficiaries on behalf of clients.Net debtNet debt is defined as Group borrowing at the balance sheet date  less operating cash.Organic growthOrganic growth corresponds to the increase in revenue for a given period (the “current period”) compared to the revenue reported for the same period of the prior fiscal year  calculated using the exchange rate for the prior fiscal year; and excluding the impact of business acquisitions (or gain of control) and divestments  as follows:for businesses acquired (or gain of control) during the current period  revenue generated since the acquisition date is excluded from the organic growth calculation;for businesses acquired (or gain of control) during the prior fiscal year  revenue generated during the current period up until the first anniversary date of the acquisition is excluded;for businesses divested (or loss of control) during the prior fiscal year  revenue generated in the comparative period of the prior fiscal year until the divestment date is excluded;for businesses divested (or loss of control) during the current fiscal year  revenue generated in the period commencing 12 months before the divestment date up to the end of the comparative period of the prior fiscal year is excluded.Underlying Net profitUnderlying Net profit presents a net income excluding significant unusual and/or infrequent elements. Therefore  it corresponds to the Net Income Group share excluding Other Income and Expense and significant non-recurring elements in both Net Financial Expense and Income Tax Expense where relevant.Underlying Net profit per shareUnderlying Net profit per share presents the Underlying net profit divided by the average number of shares.Underlying operating profit marginThe underlying operating profit margin corresponds to Underlying operating profit divided by revenues.Underlying operating profit margin at constant ratesThe underlying operating profit margin at constant rates corresponds to Underlying operating profit divided by revenues  calculated by converting 2023 figures at Fiscal 2022 rates  except for countries with hyperinflationary economies.2First half Fiscal 2023 - Condensed consolidated financial statements1 Consolidated financial statements1.1 Consolidated income statement(in million euros) FIRST HALF FISCAL 2023 FIRST HALF FISCAL 2022 Revenues 12 085 10 262 Cost of sales (10 326) (8 792) Gross profit 1 759 1 470 Selling  General and Administrative costs (1 056) (934) Share of profit of companies accounted for using the equity method that directly contribute to the Group’s business 1 2 Underlying operating profit 704 538 Other operating income 1 67 Other operating expenses (43) (68) Operating profit 662 537 Financial income 39 10 Financial expenses (87) (63) Share of profit of other companies accounted for using the equity method — — Profit for the period before tax 614 484 Income tax expense (166) (136) Net profit for the period 448 348 Of which: Attributable to non-controlling interests 8 11 ATTRIBUTABLE TO EQUITY HOLDERS OF THE PARENT 440 337 Basic earnings per share (in euro) 3.01 2.30 Diluted earnings per share (in euro) 2.98 2.271.2 Consolidated statement of comprehensive income(in million euros) FIRST HALF FISCAL 2023 FIRST HALF FISCAL 2022 NET PROFIT FOR THE PERIOD 448 348 Components of other comprehensive income that may be reclassified subsequentlyto profit or loss (384) 235 Change in fair value of cash flow hedge instruments — — Change in fair value of cash flow hedge instruments reclassified to profit or loss — — Currency translation adjustment (385) 232 Currency translation adjustment reclassified to profit or loss — 1 Tax on components of other comprehensive income that may be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss — — Share of other components of comprehensive income (loss) of companies accounted for using the equity method  net of tax 1 2 Components of other comprehensive income that will not be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss 20 147 Remeasurement of defined benefit plan obligation (101) 104 Change in fair value of financial assets revalued through other comprehensive income 98 73 Tax on components of other comprehensive income that will not be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss 23 (30) TOTAL OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)  AFTER TAX FOR THE PERIOD (365) 381 Comprehensive income for the period 82 729 Of which: Attributable to equity holders of the parent 75 717 Attributable to non-controlling interests 7 121.3 Consolidated statement of financial positionAssets(in million euros) FEBRUARY 28  2023 AUGUST 31  2022 Goodwill 6 286 6 611 Other intangible assets 661 678 Property  plant and equipment 510 510 Right-of-use assets relating to leases 843 895 Client investments 676 667 Investments in companies accounted for using the equity method 72 73 Non-current financial assets 1 144 1 025 Other non-current assets 64 172 Deferred tax assets 160 154 NON CURRENT ASSETS 10 416 10 785 Current financial assets 62 57 Inventories 350 352 Income tax receivable 183 171 Trade and other receivables 5 641 5 068 Restricted cash and financial assets related to the Benefits & Rewards Services activity 1 218 1 257 Cash and cash equivalents 2 625 3 225 Assets held for sale(1) 76 5 CURRENT ASSETS 10 155 10 135 TOTAL ASSETS 20 571 20 920(1) As of February 28  2023  assets held for sale correspond to current and non-current assets of a non-strategic activity located in several countries  excluding the associated goodwill as the amount depends on the selling price  which is still being discussed  and its allocation by country.

headquarters located in Issy-les-Moulineaux.Sodexo’s condensed interim consolidated financial statements for the six-month period from September 1  2022  to February 28  2023  were approved by the Board of Directors on April 4  2023.The numbers shown in the tables were prepared in thousands of euros and are presented in million euros (unless otherwise indicated).Note 1.Significant events1 New On-site Services organizationAs announced in July 2022  the Group has reorganized its On-site Services activity with regions and countries consolidated into geographic zones led by three Zone Presidents  with the full responsibility of the Profit and Loss. The three geographic zones are North America  Europe and Rest of the World (including Asia-Pacific  Middle East  Africa  Latin America)In order to reflect the implementation of the new organization of On-site Services by geographic zone  fully effective from October 1  2022  the Group has redefined its operating segments as defined by IFRS 8 (corresponding until then to the global client segments and now represented by regions) and has updated its segment information accordingly. Thus  within On-site Services activity  the new operating segments after aggregation correspond to the following geographic zones:North America Europe (including the Continental Europe  France and United Kingdom & Ireland regions) Rest of the World (including Asia-Pacific/ Middle East/ Africa  Latin America (without Brazil) and Brazil).Benefits & Rewards Services  not impacted by the reorganization  is an operating segment on its own.For comparability purposes  the segment information of the previous period has been restated (see note 3.1).Furthermore  in accordance with IAS 36 ""Impairment of assets""  the reorganization of On-site Services activity has led the Group to reassess the level at which goodwill impairment tests are carried out. On-site Services goodwill have therefore been reallocated to each region (group of Cash Generating Units)  which corresponds to the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes (see note 4)  based on estimated relative value in use as of August 31  2022.Note 2.Basis of preparation of the financial statements1 Accounting policies1.1 General principlesThe condensed interim consolidated financial statements for the six months ended February 28  2023  have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 ""Interim Financial Reporting""  as published by the IASB and endorsed by the European Union. They do not include all the disclosures required for a complete set of annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the Sodexo Group for the fiscal year ended August 31  2022.The accounting policies applied by the Group in the condensed interim consolidated financial statements for the six months ended February 28  2023  are the same as those used in the annual consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended August 31  2022  with the exception of the specific requirements of IAS 34 (see note 2.2) and policies impacted by the reorganization of On-site Services (see notes 1.1  3.1 and 4). The texts effective as of September 1  2022  did not have a material impact on the interim consolidated financial statements of the Group.The Group has not applied any IFRSs that had not yet been approved by the European Union as of February 28  2023. The Group has not elected to early adopt any standards or interpretations whose application is not mandatory in Fiscal 2023.2 Specific interim reporting requirementsIncome tax expenseIncome tax expense (current and deferred) in the condensed interim consolidated financial statements is computed by applying an estimated average annual tax rate for the current fiscal year to each tax reporting entity's pre-tax profit for the first half of the year as adjusted  where applicable  for the tax effect of any specific events that may have occurred during the period. The resulting deferred tax charge or benefit is recognized in deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial position.Post-employment and other long-term employee benefitsThe expense for post-employment and other long-term employee benefits is computed as one half of the annual charge estimated as of August 31  2022. The actuarial projections are updated to take into account any material changes to assumptions or one-off impacts (discount rates  applicable legislation...) during the six-month period.3 Use of estimatesThe preparation of the condensed interim consolidated financial statements requires the management of Sodexo and its subsidiaries to make estimates and assumptions that may affect the amounts reported for assets  liabilities and contingent liabilities as of the date of preparation of the financial statements  and of revenues and expenses for the period.These estimates and judgments are updated continuously based on past experience and on various other factors considered reasonable in view of the situation prevailing as of February 28  2023 and are the basis for the assessments of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities.Final amounts may differ substantially from these estimates if assumptions or circumstances change.Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions are the same as those described in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended August 31  2022 (valuation of current and non-current assets  assessment of deferred tax assets recoverability  valuation of financial assets measured at fair value  provisions – including uncertain tax treatments – and litigations  assessment of the lease term in measuring the lease liabilities and related right-of-use assets  post-employment defined benefit plan assets and liabilities  and share-based payments).Note 3.Segment information and other operating items1 Segment information and revenue informationAccounting principles and policiesIn accordance with IFRS 8 “Operating segments”  the segment information presented below has been prepared based on internal management data as monitored since the first quarter of Fiscal 2023 by the Group Leadership Team  which is Sodexo’s chief operating decision-maker: On-site Services and Benefits & Rewards Services.For On-site Services  Revenue and Underlying operating profit are followed by regions. These regions meet the definition of operating segments in IFRS 8.Sodexo’s operating segments and groups of operating segments are as follows:On-site Services: North America  Europe  which includes the Continental Europe  France and United Kingdom & Ireland regions; Rest of the World  including Asia-Pacific/Middle East/Africa  Latin America (without Brazil) and Brazil);Benefits & Rewards Services. The operating segments that have been aggregated within the On-site Services activity carry out similar operations – both in terms of type of services rendered and processes and methods used to deliver the services – and have similar economic characteristics (notably in terms of margins they generate).Segment assets and liabilities are not presented as they are not included in the chief operating decision-maker’s measurement of segment performance.1.1 Segment informationFIRST HALF FISCAL 2023(in million euros) ON-SITE SERVICES NORTH AMERICA EUROPE REST OF THE WORLD BENEFITS & REWARDS SERVICES ELIMINATIONS AND CORPORATE EXPENSES GROUP TOTAL Revenues (third-party) 11 581 5 499 4 027 2 055 504 — 12 085 Inter-segment sales (Group) — — — — 4 (4) — TOTAL REVENUES 11 581 5 499 4 027 2 055 508 (4) 12 085 Underlying operating profit* 593 365 157 71 162 (51) 704* Including Group’s share of profit of companies accounted for using the equity method that directly contribute to the Group’s businessand excluding other operating income and expenses.FIRST HALF FISCAL 2022(in million euros) ON-SITE SERVICES NORTH AMERICA EUROPE REST OF THE WORLD BENEFITS & REWARDS SERVICES ELIMINATIONS AND CORPORATE EXPENSES GROUP TOTAL Revenues (third-party) 9 865 4 232 3 917 1 716 397 — 10 262 Inter-segment sales (Group) — — — — 1 (1) — TOTAL REVENUES 9 865 4 232 3 917 1 716 398 (1) 10 262 Underlying operating profit* 481 261 151 69 106 (50) 538* Including Group’s share of profit of companies accounted for using the equity method that directly contribute to the Group’s businessand excluding other operating income and expenses.1.2 Revenue by significant countryThe Group’s operations are spread across 53 countries  including two that each represent over 10% of consolidated revenues in First Half Fiscal 2023: France (the Group’s registration country) and the United States (as well as the United Kingdom during the comparative period).

The Group has also analyzed the evolution since August 31  2022  of the main financial parameters (discount rate).The Group’s management has concluded that there was no evidence of triggers indicating a decrease in the recoverable value of its operating segments as of February 28  2023  compared to August 31  2022. The annual review of the carrying amount of goodwill and other intangible assets will be realized during the Second Half Fiscal 2023.Note 5.Provisions  litigation  and contingent liabilities1 Provisions(in million euros) AUGUST 31  2022 INCREASES/CHARGES REVERSALS WITH UTILIZATION REVERSALS WITHOUT UTILIZATION CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTAND OTHER CHANGES IN SCOPE OF CONSOLIDATION FEBRUARY 28  2023 Employee claims and litigation 55 4 (4) (1) (1) — 53 Client/supplier claims and litigation 37 2 (4) (13) (1) — 21 Tax and social security exposures 32 — (1) — (1) — 30 Contract termination and loss-making contracts 21 1 (2) (2) (3) — 15 Reorganization costs 17 1 (5) — — — 12 Negative net assets of associates (1) 8 — — — 1 — 9 Other provisions 44 8 (4) (1) 1 — 48 TOTAL PROVISIONS 214 16 (20) (17) (4) — 188(1) Investments in companies accounted for using the equity method that have negative net assets.2 Litigation and contingent liabilitiesDisputes with the Brazilian tax authoritiesThe subsidiary Sodexo Pass do Brasil was in dispute with the Brazilian tax authorities regarding the tax deductibility of the amortization of goodwill recognized on the acquisition of VR in March 2008.As a reminder  in Fiscal 2017  Sodexo Pass do Brasil received a tax reassessment notice for fiscal years 2010 to 2012 challenging the deductibility for tax purposes of the goodwill amortization  with 150% penalties and late payment interest. The reassessment amounted to 573 million Brazilian real  i.e.  111 million euros as of August 31  2022 (29 million euros in principle  43 million euros in penalties and 40 million euros in late payment interest).The Group firmly disputed this reassessment  which the Brazilian tax authorities originally envisaged during a previous tax audit covering the fiscal years 2008 and 2009 but then abandoned  as it considered that the tax amortization of goodwill was valid  and that the procedure therefore had a strong chance of succeeding in its favor.This dispute was decided on August 14  2018  before the competent administrative court (CARF). The court ruled in favor of Sodexo Pass do Brasil  considering that the goodwill and corresponding tax amortization were legitimately recognized on the acquisition of VR. This ruling in favor of Sodexo Pass do Brasil was confirmed by the Superior Court of Appeal (CSRF) at a hearing on September 13  2022 and notified in writing to the Group on October 27  2022. The Federal Tax Administration has already taken note of the decision  without expressing any request for clarification  thus definitively ending the dispute in favor of Sodexo Pass do Brasil.During Fiscal 2021  the subsidiary Sodexo do Brasil Comercial also received a tax reassessment notice mainly linked to the tax deductibility of the amortization of goodwill recognized on the purchase of Puras. The reassessment covers the period from 2015 to 2017 and amounts to 205 million Brazilian real to date  i.e.  37 million euros as of February 28  2023 (of which 9 million euros in principal and 28 million euros in penalties and late payment interests). In August 2021  the competent administrative Court ruled in favor of Sodexo do Brasil Comercial but the Brazilian tax authorities appealed this first instance decision. However  the Group considers that the risks of a change in the decision are low  considering  on the one hand  that it has strong arguments to contest the tax reassessment and  on the other hand  the recent favorable decision of the CSRF ending the dispute between Sodexo Pass do Brasil and the Brazilian tax authorities on the same issue mentioned above.The goodwill amount has been fully amortized. The tax savings generated by this tax depreciation were offset in the consolidated accounts of the Group by a deferred tax expense of the same amount for each of the related financial periods  in accordance with the IFRS rules. The balance of the related deferred tax liability amounts to 26 million euros as of February 28  2023.In addition  Sodexo and its main competitors have a different interpretation from that of the Brazilian tax administration on the deductibility of PIS/COFINS on certain purchases made at a zero rate. Several proceedings are underway  either at the initiative of the tax authorities  which have notified Sodexo do Brasil Comercial of an adjustment in respect of credits recognized in 2016 of 9 million euro (including penalties and interest for late payment)  or at the initiative of the company  which has filed several claims in the courts. One of these proceedings initiated by Sodexo do Brasil Comercial was suspended  on the initiative of the judge  until the Supreme Court's decision on another company's case. In February 2023  the Supreme Court issued its decision  which was unfavorable to the company concerned: the judges essentially ruled that ordinary law may provide for limitations on the use of PIS/COFINS credits  provided that such law respects all constitutional principles  in particular equality of treatment of taxpayers and free competition. This decision  which should not be considered automatically unfavorable for the individual cases of each taxpayer  does not affect the appeals filed by Sodexo  which will continue to follow their respective courses. The company believes that it has different and strong enough arguments to ultimately succeed in court on this issue. After consultation with its advisors  Sodexo considers that its chances of success in these proceedings are good and that to date the risk of an outflow of resources associated with the PIS/COFINS credits deducted since 2016 remains unlikely; therefore  no provision has been recorded in the consolidated financial statements as of February 28  2023.Dispute with the French competition authorityOn October 9  2015  the company Octoplus filed a complaint with the French Competition Authority (Autorité de la concurrence) concerning several French meal voucher issuers  including Sodexo Pass France. Following the hearing of the parties concerned in April and July 2016  the Competition Authority decided on October 6  2016  to continue the proceedings  without ordering interim measures against Sodexo Pass France.On February 27  2019  the prosecution services sent their final investigation report to Sodexo Pass France. In its response filed on April 29  2019  the Group contested both of the grievances notified by the Authority (exchange of information and foreclosure of the meal voucher market through the Centrale de Règlement des Titres). On December 17  2019  the French Competition Authority ruled against the meal voucher issuers and fined Sodexo Pass France  jointly and severally with Sodexo S.A.  126 million euros. This decision was formally notified to Sodexo Pass France and Sodexo S.A. on February 6  2020. Sodexo vigorously contests this decision considering that it demonstrates a flawed understanding of the practices in question and of the way in which the market operates. The Group has therefore lodged an appeal against the decision with the Paris Court of Appeal. The hearing was held on November 18  2021  and the Court of Appeal is expected to render its decision on May 25  2023.Given the significant impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the Group's activities and performance  Sodexo obtained a decision from the State collection services allowing it to defer payment of the fine until December 15  2021  without any penalty being due  subject to providing a bank guarantee  and from that date a monthly settlement plan until January 2023. An asset was recognized in ""Other operating receivables "" as a counterpart of the sums paid.After consultation with its legal advisers  the Group considers that it has solid arguments capable of resulting in the reversal or revision of the decision of the Competition Authority. As a result  no provision has been made for this dispute.French tax reassessmentSodexo S.A. received in December 2021 a notification for a proposed tax reassessment concerning fiscal years 2016  2017 and 2018. Another proposed adjustment notice was issued by the French tax authorities in December 2022 for fiscal years 2019  2020 and 2021 in order to replicate certain adjustments it had initiated during the previous tax audit.The Company has assessed the risk associated with these procedures and  after review with its tax advisors  considers that it has strong arguments to contest the proposed reassessments.Other disputesGroup subsidiaries can also be subject to tax audits certain of which may result in reassessments. Main disputes are described above. In each case  the risk is assessed by management and its advisors  and any charges deemed probable are recorded as provisions or tax liabilities.The Group is not aware of any other governmental  judicial  or arbitral proceedings which are outstanding or threatened and which may have  or have had in the past 12 months  material effects on the Group’s financial position or profitability.Sodexo is also involved in other legal proceedings arising in the normal course of its business. The Group does not anticipate that any potential related liabilities will in the aggregate be material to its activities or to its consolidated financial position.Note 6.Equity and earnings per share1 Equity1.1 Statement of changes in shareholders’ equityComposition of share capital and treasury shares(number of shares) FEBRUARY 28  2023 AUGUST 31  2022 Share Capital (1) 147 454 887 147 454 887 Treasury shares (2) 1 473 046 841 102 Outstanding shares 145 981 841 146 613 785(1) With a par value of 4 euros each.(2) Treasury shares value of 131 million euros as of February 28  2023 (74 million euros as of August 31  2022).DividendsFIRST HALF FISCAL 2023 FIRST HALF FISCAL 2022 Dividends paid (in million euros) 352 294 Dividend per share paid (in euros) 2.40 2.002 Earnings per shareThe table below presents the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share:FIRST HALF FISCAL 2023 FIRST HALF FISCAL 2022 Profit for the year attributable to equity holders of the parent (in million euros) 440 337 Basic weighted average number of shares 146 147 666 146 292 627 Basic earnings per share (1) (in euros) 3.01 2.30 Average dilutive effect of free share plans 1 577 120 2 141 092 Diluted weighted average number of shares 147 724 786 148 433 719 Diluted earnings per share (1) (in euros) 2.98 2.27(1) Basic and diluted earnings per share do not reflect the effect of the dividend premium to be paid on certain registered shares.Note 7.Cash and cash equivalents  financial assets and liabilities  and financial income and expense1 Financial income and expense(in million euros) FIRST HALF FISCAL 2023 FIRST HALF FISCAL 2022 Gross borrowing cost (1) (70) (43) Interest income from short-term bank deposits and equivalent 32 2 NET BORROWING COST (38) (41) Interest on financial lease liabilities IFRS 16(2) (9) (9) Net foreign exchange gains/(losses) — 1 Net interest cost on net defined benefit plan obligation 1 (1) Interest income from loans and receivables at amortized cost 3 3 Other financial income 4 6 Other financial expense (9) (12) NET FINANCIAL EXPENSE (48) (53) Of which Financial income 39 10 Of which Financial expense (87) (63)(1) Gross borrowing cost represents interest expense on financial liabilities at amortized cost and interest expense on hedging instruments.(2) Interest on lease liabilities recognized in accordance with IFRS 16.2 Cash and cash equivalents(in million euros) FEBRUARY 28  2023 AUGUST 31  2022 Marketable securities 580 524 Cash* 2 045 2 701 CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS 2 625 3 225 Bank overdrafts (12) (8) CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS NET OF BANK OVERDRAFTS 2 613 3 217* Including 11 million euros allocated to the liquidity contract signed with an investment services provider  which complies with the Code of conduct drawn upby the French financial markets association (Association française des arches financiers – AMAFI) and approved by the French securities regulator(Autorité des marchés financiers – AMF)  for the purpose of improving the liquidity of Sodexo shares and the regularity of the quotations.Marketable securities comprised:Chart also available on https://www.sodexo.com/en/investors/financial-results-and-publications/financial-results - Sodexo H1 Results FY23 - Slide n° 473 Financial assetsPrincipal investments in non-consolidated companiesMeasurement of Bellon SA SecuritiesThe Group holds  through its wholly owned subsidiary Sofinsod  a 19.61% stake in Bellon SA  a company that controls Sodexo SA with 42.75% of its shares and 57.5% of its voting rights exercisable on February 28  2023. This shareholding does not give the Group significant influence over Bellon SA  as voting rights attached to Bellon SA shares cannot be exercised by Sofinsod  in accordance with the provisions of Article L. 233-31 of Code de Commerce.There are no potential conflicts of interest between the duties to Sodexo of members of the Board of Directors or senior management and their private interests. In particular the Pierre and Danielle Bellon Family controls 72.6% of the family holding company Bellon SA. Mr. and Mrs. Pierre Bellon and their children entered into an agreement in June 2015 to prevent their direct descendants from freely disposing of their Bellon SA shares for 50 years. Bellon SA’s only asset is its holding in Sodexo; Bellon SA has no intention of selling this holding to a third party.In accordance with IFRS 9  this investment is measured at its fair value  determined in accordance with IFRS 13. The valuation of the fair value of the investment depends  among other things  on the revalued net asset value (NAV) of Bellon SA which has limited debt and holds no assets other than shares of Sodexo S.A. These shares are valued at their closing share price for the calculation of the NAV of Bellon SA. Furthermore  the valuation method used by management (Level 3 of the hierarchy defined by IFRS 13) incorporates the illiquidity implied by the characteristics of the holding's ownership structure (discount to net asset value of Bellon SA estimated at 40% as of February 28  2023  and August 31  2022).As of February 28  2023  the fair value of the investment is assessed at 642 million euros (541 million euros as of August 31  2022)  and its change since the opening of the period has been recorded in other non-recyclable items of comprehensive income (OCI).Restricted cash and financial assets related to the benefits & rewards services activityRestricted cash corresponds to 843 million euros of “Financial assets related to the Benefits & Rewards Services activity” primarily in funds set aside to comply with regulations governing the issuance of service vouchers in France (267 million euros)  Romania (153 million euros)  Belgium (153 million euros)  India (122 million euros) and China (72 million euros). The funds remain the property of the Group but are subject to restrictions on their use. They may not be used for any purpose other than to reimburse affiliates and must be kept separate from the Group’s unrestricted cash. Restricted cash is invested in interest-bearing instruments.4 BorrowingsChanges in borrowings during First Half Fiscal 2023 were as follows:(in million euros) AUGUST 31  2022 INCREASES REPAYMENTS DISCOUNTING EFFECTSAND OTHER CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT CHANGES IN SCOPE OF CONSOLIDATION FEBRUARY 28  2023 Bond issues (1) 5 600 40 (16) (9) (77) — 5 538 Commercial paper and bank borrowings (2) 1 250 (252) — — 2 1 Other borrowings 108 — (5) — (3) 21 120 TOTAL BORROWINGS EXCLUDING DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 5 709 290 (273) (9) (80) 23 5 659 Net fair value of derivative financial instruments 33 3 1 10 (7) — 40 TOTAL BORROWINGS 5 742 293 (272) 1 (87) 23 5 699(1) As of February 28  2023  accrued interest on bond issues represented 34 million euros (13 million euros as of August 31  2022).(2) Commercial paper was drawn short term in First Half Fiscal 2023 but all was fully repaid by February 28  2023.Chart also available on https://www.sodexo.com/en/investors/financial-results-and-publications/financial-results - Sodexo H1 Results FY23 - Slide n° 44In order to comply with the Group’s financing policy  substantially all borrowings are long term and at fixed interest rates.As of February 28  2023  95% of the Group’s borrowings were at fixed rate.

This facility has been amended on a number of occasions with the most recent amendment being in July 2019 with a new maturity date of July 2024  with two options to extend the maturity by one year each  up to July 2026. The first option to extend this facility was executed during Fiscal 2020 and the second was executed during Fiscal 2021. The facility maturity date is now July 2026. The maximum available limits under this facility now are 589 million euros plus 785 million U.S. dollars.The most recent amendment also incorporates an updated sustainability clause that links the credit facility cost to Sodexo’s ability to comply with its public commitment to reduce its food waste by 50% by 2025 and also an update to the referenced indices.Amounts drawn on this facility carry floating interest indexed on the SOFR  SONIA  ESTR and EURIBOR rates. This credit facility is not subject to any covenant.Concerning the benchmark rate reform  the Group is finalizing the discussions with their counterparts to negotiate the change of the rates  which include essentially this multilateral credit facility.No amounts had been drawn down on the facility as of either February 28  2023  nor as of August 31  2022.Bilateral confirmed credit facilityOn December 18  2019  the Group obtained two 150 million euros bilateral confirmed credit facility  both are due to expire in December 2023.On February 13  2020  the Group obtained a third 150 million euros bilateral confirmed credit facility expiring in February 2024.No amounts had been drawn down on any of these facilities as of either February 28  2023  nor as of August 31  2022.Commercial papersBorrowings under the Sodexo S.A. and Sodexo Finance commercial paper programs are nil either as of February 28  2023  nor of August 31  2022.Note 8.Other information1 Income taxThe 28.3% effective tax rate for First Half Fiscal 2022 decreased to 27.1% in First Half Fiscal 2023. The decrease in the effective tax rate is explained in particular by the decrease in the CVAE rate in France  the absence of non-recurring items with tax impact and the strong increase in the Group's pre-tax income compared to First Half Fiscal 2022 (613 million euros vs 484 million euros) which reduces the weight of negative impacts.2 Free share grantsOn January 31  2023  the Board of Directors decided to grant free shares to certain Group employees.

This agreement will take the form of a joint venture (Parlym 80%/Ecoslops 20%) which purpose be to invest with a majority stake in the local projects co-developed and financed by the two partners.In the very short term  Parlym will take  alongside Ecoslops  a minority stake in Valtech Energy in Cameroon (first client of the Scarabox®). The two partners also aim to make a second investment in 2023 in Ivory Coast  once the regulatory approvals will have been obtained.Complementary know-howEcoslops is a company specialised in the circular economy applied to hydrocarbon waste. With more than 10 years of experience in operating micro-refinery units  the company has launched an innovative automated containerised solution: the Scarabox®.Parlym is specialised in the engineering of energy infrastructure projects in the nuclear  oil & gas and renewable energy sectors.

Thanks to their partnership  Ecoslops and Parlym are able to partner with producers and collectors of hydrocarbon residues to set up and finance Scarabox® projects wherever market studies have shown their potential for profitability.Story continuesBoth companies  driven by both business objectives and social responsibility  are committed to promoting the development of the circular economy on the African continent. By giving value to this hazardous waste and offering a recycling solution based on the best technologies and know-how  this partnership around the development of the Scarabox® should prevent more waste from being inappropriately dumped in the natural ecosystem.Johann Charrier  CEO of Groupe Parlym said:""Through this new partnership  we are bringing a new solution for a virtuous and circular economy on the African territory. We are delighted to rely on Ecoslops to reduce our environmental footprint.This fits perfectly with the energy transition objectives we have set for ourselves by 2027.""Vincent Favier  CEO of Ecoslops said:""Since the launch of our Scarabox® solution  we have been looking for a strong industrial and financial partner with an extensive network in the energy sector in Africa. Parlym is the best possible partner for this project and we are confident that this association will effectively accelerate the development of these innovative and urgently needed recycling units.""This is a major step forward for the development of the circular economy of hydrocarbon residues on the African continent  fulfilling Ecoslops’ ambition to become  like Parlym  a major French industrial group operating internationally.ABOUT ECOSLOPSEcoslops is listed on Euronext Growth in ParisISIN Code: FR0011490648 - Ticker: ALESA / PEA-PME eligibleEcoslops is the cleantech that brings oil into the circular economy thanks to an innovative technology allowing the company to upgrade oil residues and used lub oil into new fuels and light bitumen.

Despite the recent rise in digitization and technology adoption  Randstad found that one-third of IT leaders are less confident in their ability to deliver on key initiatives. Respondents cited technology issues such as poor system performance  outdated and lack of technology as barriers to their success.Top Concerns for CIOsRandstad surveyed over 750 IT decision-makers in both the United States and Canada to learn more about their priorities as many companies look to modernize their technology and focus on critical investments. An overwhelming majority  90 percent of respondents  believe that technology is vital to their company heading in the right direction. Yet nearly half (44 percent) of IT leaders believe technology is only adequately or even underfunded at their organization.The study also found that while Canadian leaders had more confidence in their results than those in the US  there was more concern about the impact of talent shortages on their businesses. Twenty-one percent of Canadian IT decision-makers believed the shortages were extremely impactful on business goals versus 7 percent of US IT decision-makers.Other key findings include the following:Top concerns for IT leaders include cyber vulnerabilities  supply chain disruption  inflation and other economic factors.Companies are still falling behind in using data for business decisions as over 60 percent do not rely strongly on their internal data and analytics.Skill shortages are costly for businesses as CIOs cite a lack of skills as the biggest hindrance to digital transformation. These shortages have also been the cause of over 42 percent of organizations seeking external help.""We believe that this research helps pinpoint what's top of mind for IT leaders as they look to deliver on goals in organizations that are increasingly overwhelmed by complexity. To do this  leaders must recognize the need for talent-driven digital solutions in an environment where technology is no longer just a supporting function in an organization; it's now driving businesses and economies "" said Graig Paglieri  CEO  Randstad Technologies  North America.Story continues""Digital transformation is set to remain at the heart of businesses during the next few decades  and urgent issues like talent scarcity and skills shortages have to be addressed. Technology on its own can't innovate. Without the right talent  sustained digital transformation is not going to happen  leaving organizations unable to remain competitive in their industries "" continued Paglieri.The study is available for download here.About RandstadRandstad North America  Inc. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Randstad N.V.  the world's largest talent company and a partner of choice to clients.

Subsequently  Seadrill uplisted to the main list of the Oslo Stock Exchange with trading commencing on November 17  2022.Seadrill added approximately $187 million of Order Backlog [2] during the quarter  bringing the total as of December 31  2022 to approximately $2.3 billion.Total Adjusted EBITDA [1] for the full year of 2022 was $265 million  at the top end of Seadrill's 2022 financial guidance range.Operating revenues decreased by 15% to $228 million in Q4 2022 largely due to fewer rig operating days overall across the fleet.Total Adjusted EBITDA [1] was $41 million in Q4 2022 in line with expectations and previous guidance  but lower than prior quarters primarily as a result of: (i) idle time for the West Tellus   which completed upgrades for its upcoming long-term campaign with Petrobras that commenced in early January 2023; (ii) fewer rig operating days for the West Hercules   which concluded its operations in Canada and subsequently demobilized to Norway; and (iii) not benefiting from a full quarter of operating results with respect to the rigs sold under the Jackup Sale.Consistent operational performance in Q4 2022  resulting in 95% technical utilization.Seadrill completed the sale of the legal entities that own and operate seven jackup rigs ( AOD I  AOD II  AOD III  West Callisto  West Ariel  West Cressida and West Leda ) in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia on October 18  2022 (the ""Jackup Sale""). The Jackup Sale triggered a mandatory payment of $204 million (inclusive of principal  accrued interest and exit fee) under Seadrill's secured second lien debt facility (the ""Second Lien Facility"").On November 14  2022  Seadrill made a voluntary payment of $269 million (inclusive of principal  accrued interest and exit fee) under the Second Lien Facility.Cash and cash equivalents  which excludes restricted cash  as at December 31  2022 was $480 million. The increase was primarily driven by proceeds from the Jackup Sale  partly offset by debt payments made under the Second Lien Facility. In addition  restricted cash as at December 31  2022 was $118 million.On December 22  2022  Seadrill entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Aquadrill LLC (formerly Seadrill Partners LLC) in an all-stock transaction.Story continuesSubsequent EventsOn February 10  2023  Seadrill made a voluntary payment of $118 million (inclusive of principal  accrued interest and exit fee) under the Second Lien Facility.

Subsequently  Seadrill uplisted to the main list of the Oslo Stock Exchange with trading commencing on November 17  2022.Seadrill added approximately $187 million of Order Backlog [2] during the quarter  bringing the total as of December 31  2022 to approximately $2.3 billion.Total Adjusted EBITDA [1] for the full year of 2022 was $265 million  at the top end of Seadrill's 2022 financial guidance range.Operating revenues decreased by 15% to $228 million in Q4 2022 largely due to fewer rig operating days overall across the fleet.Total Adjusted EBITDA [1] was $41 million in Q4 2022 in line with expectations and previous guidance  but lower than prior quarters primarily as a result of: (i) idle time for the West Tellus   which completed upgrades for its upcoming long-term campaign with Petrobras that commenced in early January 2023; (ii) fewer rig operating days for the West Hercules   which concluded its operations in Canada and subsequently demobilized to Norway; and (iii) not benefiting from a full quarter of operating results with respect to the rigs sold under the Jackup Sale.Consistent operational performance in Q4 2022  resulting in 95% technical utilization.Seadrill completed the sale of the legal entities that own and operate seven jackup rigs ( AOD I  AOD II  AOD III  West Callisto  West Ariel  West Cressida and West Leda ) in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia on October 18  2022 (the ""Jackup Sale"").

The increase was primarily driven by proceeds from the Jackup Sale  partly offset by debt payments made under the Second Lien Facility. In addition  restricted cash as at December 31  2022 was $118 million.On December 22  2022  Seadrill entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Aquadrill LLC (formerly Seadrill Partners LLC) in an all-stock transaction.Story continuesSubsequent EventsOn February 10  2023  Seadrill made a voluntary payment of $118 million (inclusive of principal  accrued interest and exit fee) under the Second Lien Facility.

BEN-2293 is a selective inhibitor of the three tropomyosin-related kinases (Trk) receptors (TrkA  TrkB and TrkC) formulated to be administered topically in patients with mild-to-moderate AD.The study's primary endpoint was safety and tolerability  while secondary endpoints of the study were also specifically powered to show the fraction of patients achieving an improvement in the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) and the fraction of patients achieving an improvement in the pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (NRS).In this Phase IIa study  91 patients aged between 18-65 years with mild-to-moderate AD were randomised to receive either 1% BEN-2293 (n=49) or placebo (n=42) twice daily for 28 days on affected skin up to a maximum of 30% body surface area (BSA). BEN-2293 was shown to be safe and well-tolerated but did not demonstrate a statistically significant effect on NRS or EASI endpoints across the Intention-To-Treat (ITT) population.However  initial analysis of percentage BSA affected by AD showed an EASI treatment effect for BEN-2293 in patients with greater extent of disease at baseline  with magnitude of treatment effect growing over time (p=0.0296). This result was also observed in the Per-Protocol population (p=0.0427) with the data at 28 days showing an interaction between treatment effect and disease burden (p=0.0237) such that a significant treatment effect for BEN-2293 over placebo is expected for subjects with BSA affected of 20% or greater.This initial analysis suggests a new avenue for further clinical investigation.Dr Anne Phelan  Chief Scientific Officer at BenevolentAI  said: ""BEN-2293 was found to be safe and well tolerated in this study. Although the top-line efficacy findings are not conclusive  the significant relationship of EASI efficacy with affected BSA requires further investigation and supports the hypothesis of utilising a PanTrk inhibitor in AD. We will continue to review and analyse the complete dataset in order to fully understand the outcome and the next steps.”About BenevolentAIBenevolentAI (AMS: BAI) is a leading  clinical-stage AI-enabled drug discovery and development company listed on the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange.

This remains around 10% lower than 2019  the last financial year before the health crisis and the fall in global markets. On a like-for-like basis  the increase in annual turnover was +11.3%.DELAYED IMPACTS OF INFLATION ON SALE PRICESThe delay in the impacts of increases in purchase prices on sale prices  combined with the additional costs generated by supply pressures  weighed heavily on the Group’s results in 2022. Gross operating surplus (GOS) was therefore down by -30.6% to €81.3m. Price increases on the main items (raw materials  components  energy  transport and labour costs) represented an additional cost of nearly €85m. About 55% of these increases were passed on over the course of the year  with an improving trend in the second half (60%).Current operating income amounted to €38.6m  representing a current operating margin of 3.9%  down 4.3 points compared to 2021.

The distribution of a dividend of €0.30 per share for 2022 will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders to be held on Thursday 25 May 2023.SLIGHT GROWTH EXPECTED IN 2023For the 2023 financial year  AKWEL remains cautious with regard to the sector’s recovery forecasts and anticipates a slight increase in turnover  in a continuing context of very limited visibility on the global automotive market due to economic and geopolitical tensions.

On a like-for-like basis  growth reached +5%.The share of proprietary products in the core business increased at 18% of sales  compared to 14% in 2021.In 2022  the COVID business represented only 39% of consolidated sales (compared to 56% in 2021)  in a market undergoing a sharp drop in sales prices and volumes. During the second half  the share of COVID activities fell to 27% of sales.Gross margin reached 46.7% of sales compared to 55.5% in 2021. This decrease is mainly linked to the decline of the COVID activity and to exceptional depreciations made on COVID products inventory in the context of the end of the pandemic. Excluding these exceptional depreciations  gross margin reached 50% of sales.Structuring staff to develop the activity in new marketsResearch and Development efforts are continuing  notably through the purchase of new fixed-asset equipment (for more than €0.7 million in France) and stable expenses. Marketing and sales expenses increased by €2.5 million  mainly due to an increase in payroll costs linked to the structuring and development of the activity in new markets  as well as the increase in the consolidation scope.

On a like-for-like basis  growth reached +5%.The share of proprietary products in the core business increased at 18% of sales  compared to 14% in 2021.In 2022  the COVID business represented only 39% of consolidated sales (compared to 56% in 2021)  in a market undergoing a sharp drop in sales prices and volumes. During the second half  the share of COVID activities fell to 27% of sales.Gross margin reached 46.7% of sales compared to 55.5% in 2021. This decrease is mainly linked to the decline of the COVID activity and to exceptional depreciations made on COVID products inventory in the context of the end of the pandemic. Excluding these exceptional depreciations  gross margin reached 50% of sales.Structuring staff to develop the activity in new marketsResearch and Development efforts are continuing  notably through the purchase of new fixed-asset equipment (for more than €0.7 million in France) and stable expenses. Marketing and sales expenses increased by €2.5 million  mainly due to an increase in payroll costs linked to the structuring and development of the activity in new markets  as well as the increase in the consolidation scope. G&A expenses rose by €4.0 million  directly related to bank fees related to new loans and to costs related to the M&A activity  which was particularly important in 2022.

Proposed term of officeThe Board of Directors proposes to renew Mr Bruno Colmant' term of office for a period of three years  expiring at the end of the Annual General Meeting in 2026.2. Professional qualifications of the candidate and list of his functions and mandates Principal activity: Director at Roland Berger.Bruno Colmant is a business engineer (Solvay Business School); Master of Tax Law (ESSF) and of Business Administration (Purdue University); PhD in applied economic sciences (Solvay Business School)  CFA  FRM  etc. In the past  Bruno Colmant held various leading positions in the financial services sector: CEO and Head of Private Banking at Degroof Petercam  CEO of ING Luxembourg  CFO of ING Belgium  chief of staff of the Belgian minister of finance  CEO of Euronext Brussels  member of the board of directors of the New York Stock Exchange  and co-CEO of Ageas. He is also a member of the Royal Academy of Belgium; he teaches at several Belgian and Luxembourg universities and is the author of multiple publications in economics and on tax matters.Mr Bruno Colmant was an independent director of Brederode (Belgium) from May 2010 to May 2014 and has been an independent director of Brederode (Luxembourg) since May 2014.Positions with listed companies (other than Brederode): none.Other mandates: Director of UNIBRA  of the University Hospital Brussels Erasmus  of Newtree Impact and of Icare.3. Independence criteriaMr Colmant is a director at the Roland Berger consultancy firm. Until May 2022  he was a director of the Degroof Petercam bank  with which Brederode maintains contractual relations. Degroof Petercam is not  however  among the main bankers who are custodians of the assets and manage the group's operations. Moreover  Mr Colmant has not been involved in any way in the management of client portfolios  and in particular not of Brederode's. Thus  the Degroof Petercam bank does not engage in any major business relationships with Brederode within the meaning of the Corporate Governance Charter  and Mr Colmant's now terminated mandate as director of that bank did not prevent him being considered an independent director of Brederode.Mr Bruno Colmant has been an independent director of Brederode for more than 12 years  if we include the period during which he was an independent director of the Belgian Brederode company  which has now been dissolved. If one takes into consideration only the present-day Luxembourg Brederode company  the maximum period of 12 years will be reached before the end of the director mandate that is being proposed. The Board of Directors considers that these circumstances are not such as to deprive Mr Bruno Colmant of the status of independent director.

That  and the cancellation of pandemic restrictions at the beginning of 2022 ha…,English LithuanianThe year 2022 is the first full year when the financial results of Akropolis Group are calculated together with the financial results of the shopping centre Akropole Alfa in Riga. That  and the cancellation of pandemic restrictions at the beginning of 2022 had the biggest impact on consolidated financial results of Akropolis Group in 2022. The tenants’ turnover in five shopping and entertainment centres managed by the group amounted to EUR 1.11 billion last year  67 % more compared to 2021. Group’s 2022 rental income amounted to EUR 75.1 million  its earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) amounted to EUR 71.9 million  respectively by 31 % and 26 % more compared to 2021.“At the beginning of 2022  the coronavirus restrictions were lifted  which had a positive effect on the visitor footfall and the tenants’ turnover in the shopping centres  which grew last year compared to 2021. In Akropolis shopping centres  including the results of the shopping centre Akropole Alfa  acquired in late 2021 and fully integrated into the group structure during the past year  we had more than 41 million visitors last year  though the pre-pandemic visitor footfall levels were not reached yet  however  the annual Akropolis tenants’ turnover  having eliminated the inflation effect  was back to the pre-pandemic levels. The attractiveness of Akropolis shopping centres for both partners and visitors is reflected by their occupancy rate  which remained very high last year and was 98%. The financial performance of Akropolis Group also improved last year  the company maintains a strong position in the Baltic market  though last year’s energy pricing challenges have decreased group’s profitability level  which haven’t reached the prepandemic level ” Manfredas Dargužis  the CEO of Akropolis Group comments.According to M. Dargužis  the shopping centres managed by Akropolis Group seek to offer the widest selection of relevant brands  services and leisure places. The company actively works with existing and potential partners  new brands are presented to visitors  popular brands’ shops are revamped and expanded. During last year  after the successful integration of the shopping centre Akropole Alfa into the Akropolis Group structure and renaming it  popular brands Deichmann  Ballzy  Pepco  Scalini  Este  Candy Pop and other brands opened their shops in this shopping centre.The international credit rating agencies S&P Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings in  respectively  June and August 2022  reconfirmed the long-term credit ratings of Akropolis Group as BB+ with a stable outlook. Akropolis Group was first rated in 2021  before the placement of its debut EUR 300 million 5-year bond issue (with 2.875% annual interest). The bonds of Akropolis Group are listed on Nasdaq Vilnius and Euronext Dublin stock exchanges.Planned investmentsAkropolis Group continues investing in revamping and development of its shopping centres. Currently  the interior renovation project of the common spaces of Klaipėda Akropolis is going on  during which spaces with the area of more than 10 000 m2 will be renovated. A one-storey building of 480 m2 is going to be constructed nearby the shopping and entertainment centre Akropolis Vilnius  which will emerge replacing temporary structures that are currently there and will allow expanding the retail areas.“We are actively working with the largest development project of our group – development of the multifunctional complex Akropolis Vingis in Vilnius. Last year  after the presentation of the design to the public  the Vilnius City Municipality approved of the design proposals for the multifunctional quarter planned in Vilkpėdė district. We are currently preparing a technical design for Akropolis Vingis  and at the end of this year we expect to obtain a document permitting construction ” the CEO of Akropolis Group says.Akropolis Group pays great attention to sustainable activities. In 2022  it was decided to adopt a systematic approach to sustainability  and the Group launched the preparation of its sustainability strategy  which will include ambitious short and long-term sustainability goals.

This agreement will take the form of a joint venture (Parlym 80%/Ecoslops 20%) which purpose be to invest with a majority stake in the local projects co-developed and financed by the two partners.In the very short term  Parlym will take  alongside Ecoslops  a minority stake in Valtech Energy in Cameroon (first client of the Scarabox®). The two partners also aim to make a second investment in 2023 in Ivory Coast  once the regulatory approvals will have been obtained.Complementary know-howEcoslops is a company specialised in the circular economy applied to hydrocarbon waste. With more than 10 years of experience in operating micro-refinery units  the company has launched an innovative automated containerised solution: the Scarabox®.Parlym is specialised in the engineering of energy infrastructure projects in the nuclear  oil & gas and renewable energy sectors. With a turnover of more than €150 million  50% of which is generated in France and 50% in Africa (where it has been established for more than 50 years)  Parlym has recognised experience in carrying out hazard studies  environmental impact assessments and project management assistance in many countries.The two partners master the entire value chain: environmental impact studies  filing of permits  design of units and sites  financing  construction and operation of industrial units.A new circular economy offer for AfricaThe Scarabox® is a micro-refinery unit that recycles hydrocarbon residues locally (marine and landbased petroleum waste and used lub oil) into fuel and light bitumen for the surrounding industries.

The goal of the project over the next three years is to create a single platform to provide cyber threat intelligence services to companies and government entities.The French government has announced its support for the development of the country's cybersecurity sector under the France 2030 investment plan and national cyber strategy . French companies specialising in cybersecurity have been invited to propose the innovative technologies needed to ensure France's sovereignty in this area  and have joined forces on the SCRED project  which has been selected after a call for projects launched by Bpifrance  the French public investment bank.Led by Thales  SCRED includes players from both the private and public sectors: ATOS  Filigran  GeoTrend  Glimps  Harfanglab  KORLabs Cybersecurity  Sekoia and SnowPack  as well as the Institut Mines-Télécom and INP Grenoble. While the immediate aim of the project is to provide services to French organisations  the platform will lay the foundations for a centralised service offering  including a National Cyber Situation Analysis Centre that will ultimately help to ensure European sovereignty in the field of cybersecurity.As the information systems of today's organisations become ever more complex and exposed to cyberattacks of increasing sophistication  tools that contribute to the cyber resilience of our societies need to be adopted on a much wider scale. The European Central Bank  for example  recently recommended that a cyber stress test for banking institutions should be introduced by next year.2 As a first step  a single national cyber intelligence database  backed by a technical analysis centre  will provide a shared picture of the threat landscape that will help players better anticipate and detect threats and share information across a given sector of industry or community of interest.""Thales is committed to working with other cybersecurity specialists to accelerate the maturity of France's cyber intelligence capabilities and strengthen the country's collective security. This project will coordinate a whole ecosystem of players to provide users with a full service platform and contribute to France's strategic autonomy in this area "" said Pierre-Yves Jolivet  VP Cyber Solutions for Thales.Led by Thales  which will coordinate its capabilities and expertise with those of 10 other companies and organisations specialising in cybersecurity  SCRED will offer a range of services that no other country has yet been able to provide through a single system. They include a national database to pool and exploit threat intelligence in a trusted cloud  an analysis service to provide insights into threats at any given point in time  and data analytics to reveal trends and make projections based on models and advanced artificial intelligence technologies.SCRED will provide users with a competitive edge by reducing the cost of accessing cyber threat intelligence and responding to attacks. It will help to consolidate users' confidence in information systems  support greater cyber sovereignty by using French solutions  and pave the way for new standards recognised in Europe and internationally.The data collected from SCRED members and the user community will lay the foundations for the creation of a new National Cyber Situation Analysis Centre. Further ahead  the project could support EU-wide autonomy in the production and use of cyber intelligence data  threat detection capabilities and information sharing between countries  sectors and companies. This ambitious project will also support the development of emerging European companies and market leaders.In the age of information warfare  the phenomenon of data poisoning is a growing concern for the Cybersecurity Operations Centres (CSOCs) and Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) that gather vast amounts of raw and non-contextualised data about cyber activity. Relevant data processing and analytics skills are therefore highly sought after by companies of all sizes.According to a report published in March 2023 by ANSSI  France's national agency for information system security  the number of proven cases of unauthorised access reported to the agency increased by 37% from 2020 to 2021  with smaller businesses and public service providers among the most frequently targeted organisations.3 A single data gathering and analysis centre  with information shared across a given community of interest - such as the space industry  naval defence  aviation or any other sector of activity - will help to meet growing demand from players who currently have few tools at their disposal.Participants in the SCRED project:ATOS  Filigran  GeoTrend  Glimps  Harfanglab  KORLabs Cybersecurity  Sekoia  SnowPack  Insitut Mines Télécom - Télécom SudParis  INP Grenoble  Thales.Attend the FIC conference on April 6 2:30-3:30 p.m. : FIC EUROPE - Du 5 au 7 avril 2023 - Lille Grand Palais (forum-fic.com)Towards a strategic autonomy of cyber intelligence?Alexis Caurette  VP Strategy and Marketing BL CDSIvan Fontarensky  Cyber Threat Intelligence Expert1 SCRED: Socle Commun du Renseignement cyber Et de la Détection / shared cyber intelligence and threat detection platform2 Interview with Verslo žinios (europa.eu) : « We need banks to be prepared.

Together with energy supplier Vulkan Energiewirtschaft Oderbrücke (VEO) - a joint venture between the city of Eisenhüttenstadt and ArcelorMittal - and McPhy Energy  specialized in low-carbon hydrogen production and distribution equipment (electrolyzers and refueling stations)  ArcelorMittal Eisenhüttenstadt will build a pilot electrolysis plant and a hydrogen filling station on the plant site.The innovative demonstration project includes the supply of two McLyzer electrolysers with an output of 1 MW each. In addition  a long-term 5-year service contract was agreed upon. The state of Brandenburg is funding the project with 5.1 million euros as part of the regional innovation cluster.The electrolysers will produce hydrogen for direct use in steel production. The hydrogen will first be used in the cold rolling mill. The hydrogen filling station is used to refuel forklifts or trucks with some of the hydrogen produced. The oxygen also generated during electrolysis is to be reused on site in production  for example in the hot rolling mill.Smart operating modes to increase energy efficiencyAnother goal is to optimize the overall energy efficiency of the production site by testing newly developed smart operating modes in real-world applications. They should make it possible to determine the best combination of software and hardware to improve system performance - comparable to software improvement in aircraft by implementing an intelligent strategy to control aircraft functions. The Brandenburgish Technical University (BTU) Cottbus-Senftenberg is providing scientific support for the project and analyzing data from hydrogen use at the demonstration plant to improve efficiency and support further development of electrolysers.Reiner Blaschek  CEO ArcelorMittal Germany: ""The demonstration plant will serve H2 use in steel production as well as the logistical use of hydrogen-powered vehicles around steel production. With this project  we want to examine and show how further emission reductions are possible now  before a complete change in technology and the use of further hydrogen in the coming years will fully convert production to climate neutrality.""Prof. Dr. Jörg Steinbach  Minister of Economics of the State of Brandenburg: “The use of hydrogen in steel production contributes significantly to the urgently needed hydrogen infrastructure as a necessary building block for maintaining the steel industry in Brandenburg and for the energy transition. The project couples the energy  industry and mobility sectors and helps to reduce CO2 emissions in steel production and in the state of Brandenburg in the long term.”Jean-Baptiste Lucas  Chief Executive Officer of McPhy: ""We are proud to participate in this large-scale and innovative project alongside ArcelorMittal and the State of Brandenburg. This is our first major contract in the industrial sector  one of the most strategic and promising applications for green hydrogen. The work will be carried out in Germany  close to our site in Wildau. This is a milestone in our European expansion strategy and a proof of the importance of our pan-European industrial set-up.”Prof. Dr. Lars Röntzsch  BTU Cottbus: “Increasing energy efficiency through the use of intelligent operating modes in electrolysis is a challenging topic that we are very happy to work on scientifically in order to make our contribution to ensuring that this important future technology enables climate-neutral operation in such an energy-intensive industry as the steel industry.

After-hours stock trading refers to any kind of transaction that occurs outside the typical 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. market hours on any day the markets are open. This type of trading allows investors to take advantage of opportunities and flexibly manage their portfolios.The Pros of After-Hours Stock TradingThere are many advantages to after-hours stock trading  such asAbility to React Quickly to News or Market EventsThe after-hours stock markets allow investors to react quickly to news or events outside regular market hours. Being able to react quickly can provide an advantage over competitors and help investors stay ahead of the market.Improved AccessibilityDue to extended trading hours  investing in the stock markets has become more accessible for most people. It allows investors from all walks of life  regardless of location or time constraints  to participate in the stock markets.Improved Market EfficiencyThe after-hours stock markets enable investors to make more efficient trades  as prices can be adjusted in real-time. This improved market efficiency can help keep the markets fair and provide a better overall experience for all investors.In addition  after-hours stock trading can help investors capitalize on price discrepancies between the closing bell of one trading day and the opening bell of the next.The Cons of After-Hours Stock TradingUnfortunately  there are some potential downsides to after-hours stock trading as well.Less LiquidityThere are fewer participants in after-hours trading. This can make it challenging to buy and sell shares quickly enough to take advantage of stock price changes.Higher VolatilityAfter-hours stock trading is often associated with higher volatility. It means that while you may have the opportunity to make larger profits  there is also a greater chance of experiencing losses.Restrictions on Some TradesSome restrictions on after-hours stock trading set by the SEC may make it difficult to execute certain trades. For example  companies must provide public disclosures before any options or derivatives can be traded in after-hours markets.Ultimately  after-hours stock trading is an option that can be beneficial for investors who understand the risks and are comfortable with the potential rewards. Doing your research before making any trades and ensuring you have a solid understanding of the market. After-hours stock trading is a great way to improve your portfolio.Check Out Premarket to After-Hours Trading: Trading Hours Explained:How Does it Work?After-hours stock trading is an excellent way for investors to take advantage of market opportunities outside regular market hours. However  it’s important to understand the differences between the ECN and EHT markets before engaging in after-hours trading.By doing so  investors can ensure that they are entering into trades with an appropriate level of risk and with the knowledge of how best to manage their orders. After-hours trading occurs in two distinct markets—the Electronic Communication Network (ECN) and the Extended Hours Trading (EHT).Electronic Communication Network (ECN)The ECN market is a network of financial firms and traders that provides individual investors access to the market. This trading typically occurs in the evening  when traditional markets are closed.During after-hours trading  orders are not entered into the main stock exchange but rather transmitted electronically between participants on the ECN. Because this type of trading is not done through a central or national stock exchange  it is generally faster and more cost effective than traditional market trading.Extended Hours Trading (EHT)The EHT market is an extended version of the traditional stock market that operates for an additional two hours after the regular closing time. During this period  investors have access to the same stock prices and options as during the regular trading day.The main difference between EHT and ECN is that orders entered in the EHT market are executed immediately rather than waiting for an opening or closing bell. This type of trading is also more volatile  as there is often less liquidity available in the market than during regular hours.Placing An OrderOnce you’ve decided which type of trading is best for you  it’s time to place an order. ECN orders are typically placed through a broker or online platform. The order will be transmitted directly to the participants in the ECN and executed within seconds.For EHT orders  investors must first choose which stock to buy or sell. They can then place the order online or through a broker  which will be executed as soon as possible. Depending on the market conditions  orders may take longer to execute during after-hours trading than during regular hours.It’s important to remember that while after-hours stock trading can provide many advantages  it also carries some risks. Before engaging in after-hours trading  investors should understand the potential markets and order types and assess their risk tolerance accordingly.Risks To Be Aware OfOne of the biggest risks associated with after-hours trading is price fluctuation. This type of trading often involves less liquidity and higher volatility than regular market hours  which can cause stocks to be priced differently.Also  there could be wider spreads between bid and ask prices because there may not be enough buyers or sellers to set a price. It can create more risk for investors as they may buy or sell at prices not representative of the current market value.By understanding these elements of after-hours stock trading  investors can make informed decisions about when to engage in this type of trading and how to execute orders best.Importance of After-Hours TradingAfter-hours trading is becoming increasingly popular among investors. There are several advantages of after-hours trading for investors and those who want to take advantage of this type of investing.Improved Access to CapitalBy participating in after-hours trading  investors have better access to capital as they can take advantage of market movements outside the standard trading hours. For example  if a company announces news of a potential merger or acquisition  investors can capitalize on the event by trading during after-hours.Enhanced VolatilityDuring after-hours trading  there is often more volatility as fewer traders participate in the market. It can create an opportunity for traders to take advantage of large price movements during these periods.Increased Trading OpportunitiesBy participating in after-hours trading  investors have access to a wider range of stocks and instruments that may not be available during normal market hours. It allows them to take advantage of opportunities in sectors or markets that may otherwise be inaccessible.Benefits of Extended Trading HoursExtended trading hours or after-hours trading. Extended trading can be beneficial for investors in several ways.Faster ResponseExtended trading hours enable investors to respond quickly to news or market events when the regular stock exchanges are closed. It can benefit investors who might otherwise miss opportunities due to slower response times.ConvenienceAfter-hours trading is also convenient for investors  as they can buy and sell stocks whenever they want. This makes it easier for investors to manage their portfolios and take advantage of opportunities that might arise outside regular trading hours.Avoid LossesExtended trading hours also allow investors to avoid losses due to price movements that occur after regular stock exchanges have closed. Since the markets are open longer  investors have more time to react to changes in stock prices.Capture Market MovesLastly  extended trading hours allow investors to capture short-term market movements that may occur after regular stock exchanges close. It can benefit investors who want to take advantage of quick price fluctuations or capitalize on news that may immediately impact stock prices. As such  extended trading hours can be a valuable tool for investors who want to take advantage of opportunities and maximize their returns.Standard Market vs. Premarket/After HoursTo understand what these terms mean  let’s take a closer look at both types of trading:Standard Market TradingThis type of trading occurs during normal business hours  with most trades happening during a three-hour window in the morning and another two-hour window in the afternoon. The most active days for stock market trading are Monday to Friday  with the greatest volume of transactions occurring.During this period  buyers and sellers can agree to buy or sell securities at their respective market prices.Premarket and After-Hours TradingPre-market trading starts before the stock market opens  while after-hours trading continues after it closes. Overall  premarket and after-hours trading can provide investors with additional opportunities  but they should also understand its risks before investing.Additionally  while some brokers offer extended trading hours  it is essential to understand their fees and restrictions before getting started.Let’s compare Standard Market and Premarket trading to understand better.Factors Standard Market Trading Premarket and After Hours Trading Order Execution Time 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. ET Premarket: 7:00 a.m. and 9:25 a.m. ET After Hours: 4:05 p.m. and 8:00 p.m. ET Trading Platform Exchanges like NYSE Euronext  AMEX  and other regionals and on NASDAQ via various venues Leading Electronic Market Order Types Accepted Many order types are accepted  such as stop  limit  and market orders. Only limit orders are accepted Eligible Order Size No limits Maximum quantity of a single order is 25 000 shares Available Security Many security types are available such as bonds  mutual funds  options  and stocks. Most listed and NASDAQ securitiesHow to Trade Stocks After Hours?Here are the steps to follow when trading stocks after hours:Open An AccountThe first step to trading stocks after hours is opening an account with a brokerage that allows you to trade after hours. Most brokerages offer this option  so go for the one with the best rate and features.Review Pre-Market ActivityBefore placing a trade  review your chosen stock’s pre-market activity and consider any news or events that might have affected the stock’s value.Understand Your RiskDifferent stocks carry different levels of risk  and it’s important to understand what you’re getting into before trading after hours. Be aware of the potential for greater losses due to decreased liquidity  price volatility  and wider spreads.Place The TradeOnce you’ve determined the stock you want to trade and the amount of risk you’re comfortable taking  place the order. Orders are generally placed through a broker or online trading platform.Monitor Your PositionIt is important to actively monitor your position after hours as smaller markets can be more volatile  and prices can change quickly.Close Your PositionWhen you’re ready to close your position  enter a market order or do a limit order to exit your position. Make sure to keep up with the latest news that could affect the value of your investments  and be prepared for any sudden price changes.Once you’re ready to close  it is important to do so quickly and not wait until the pre-market trading session begins. It will help you avoid any potential losses due to overnight price changes.These are the steps for how to trade stocks after hours. With careful research and monitoring of your position  you can make informed decisions and take advantage of the opportunity to trade after hours.FAQsWho Sets the Price of a Stock?The supply and demand in the market determine the price of a stock. A company’s share price is based on its earnings  performance  economic conditions  investor sentiment  and investor confidence. All these elements affect how willing people are to buy or sell the stock.Who is Allowed to Trade After Hours?After-hour trading is allowed for all investors  both individual and institutional. Until 1999  after-hours trading was restricted to just the institutional investors who had access to the market structures that enabled them to participate in this activity.At the start of 1999  retail investors were allowed to trade in the extended hours sessions for the first time. This made it possible for individual investors to trade in previously unavailable after-hours markets.How Do You Trade in The First 15 Minutes?The first 15 minutes of the trading day can be crucial for any trader  as it can set the tone and direction for the rest of the trading session. To make sure you profitably start your trading day  here are some steps to follow:Before trading  review the news and economic calendar for any upcoming events that may affect the market during these 15 minutes. It will help you make decisions about possible trades.To stay focused on your trading strategy  setting a goal for the first few minutes of trading is important. It could be to trade a specific volume or reach a certain target price.Monitor the market closely during these 15 minutes and look for opportunities to buy or sell. You can look at charts  analyze technical indicators  or study financial news.Make sure to choose a stock when it crosses the highest price of these first 15 minutes.Place your order and adjust it as needed  depending on the market conditions.Monitor the progress of your trade and make adjustments if necessary.Can We Buy Stocks in Pre-Opening?Yes  it is possible to buy stocks in pre-opening. Pre-opening refers to the period before the official start of a trading session when markets are open but trading has not yet begun. During this period  traders can enter orders and execute trades without significant price movements or large activity volumes.It allows you to capitalize on market opportunities before the official opening of trading. Additionally  pre-opening allows more efficient and timely execution of orders since liquidity is generally higher during this period.However  you should note that they could potentially face greater risks when trading pre-opening  as price movements can be less predictable due to the lack of information on the underlying security.ConclusionAH (after-hours) trading is a popular stock market activity that occurs after a given exchange’s regular trading hours. It means that investors can buy and sell stocks even when markets are closed  giving them an edge over traditional investors who are limited to the standard days and times for trading.If you are considering investing in stocks  it is crucial to understand AH shares  as they can offer several potential benefits.,negative,0.2,0.36,0.45,mixed,0.51,0.11,0.37,True,English,"['Late Trading', 'AH', 'Stocks', 'Secrets', 'Excess Cash Flow Value Funds', 'ECF Value Funds', 'Gates Capital Management', 'fantastic track record', 'national stock exchange', 'Electronic Communication Network', 'additional two hours', 'stock investment strategy', 'stock price changes', 'main stock exchange', 'regular closing time', 'two distinct markets', 'one trading day', 'regular trading day', 'regular trading hours', 'same stock prices', 'traditional stock market', 'regular market hours', 'Hours Stock Trading', 'traditional market trading', 'extended trading hours', 'Extended Hours Trading', 'Improved Market Efficiency', 'The EHT market', 'The ECN market', 'extended weekends', 'extended version', 'traditional markets', 'stock markets', 'credit strategy', 'Improved Accessibility', 'time constraints', 'price discrepancies', 'closing bell', 'main difference', 'The Cons', 'hours markets', 'daunting prospect', 'blog post', 'event-driven equity', 'past 26 years', 'second half', 'typical 9:30 a', 'many advantages', 'most people', 'overall experience', 'opening bell', 'potential downsides', 'Less Liquidity', 'Higher Volatility', 'larger profits', 'greater chance', 'public disclosures', 'potential rewards', 'solid understanding', 'great way', 'excellent way', 'appropriate level', 'financial firms', 'Market Events', 'market opportunities', 'EHT markets', '12.6% annualised return', 'fewer participants', 'efficient trades', 'modern investors', 'individual investors', 'AH stocks', '3.4% return', 'term', 'weekdays', 'holidays', 'Risk', 'full', 'name', 'Read', 'idea', 'kind', 'transaction', 'type', 'portfolios', 'Ability', 'News', 'competitors', 'walks', 'life', 'location', 'real-time', 'shares', 'opportunity', 'losses', 'Restrictions', 'Some', 'example', 'companies', 'options', 'derivatives', 'research', 'Premarket', 'differences', 'knowledge', 'orders', 'traders', 'evening', 'central', 'period', '4:00', '8:00']",2023-04-05,2023-04-06,valuewalk.com

An overwhelming majority  90 percent of respondents  believe that technology is vital to their company heading in the right direction. Yet nearly half (44 percent) of IT leaders believe technology is only adequately or even underfunded at their organization.The study also found that while Canadian leaders had more confidence in their results than those in the US  there was more concern about the impact of talent shortages on their businesses. Twenty-one percent of Canadian IT decision-makers believed the shortages were extremely impactful on business goals versus 7 percent of US IT decision-makers.Other key findings include the following:Top concerns for IT leaders include cyber vulnerabilities  supply chain disruption  inflation and other economic factors.Companies are still falling behind in using data for business decisions as over 60 percent do not rely strongly on their internal data and analytics.Skill shortages are costly for businesses as CIOs cite a lack of skills as the biggest hindrance to digital transformation. These shortages have also been the cause of over 42 percent of organizations seeking external help.""We believe that this research helps pinpoint what's top of mind for IT leaders as they look to deliver on goals in organizations that are increasingly overwhelmed by complexity. To do this  leaders must recognize the need for talent-driven digital solutions in an environment where technology is no longer just a supporting function in an organization; it's now driving businesses and economies "" said Graig Paglieri  CEO  Randstad Technologies  North America.""Digital transformation is set to remain at the heart of businesses during the next few decades  and urgent issues like talent scarcity and skills shortages have to be addressed. Technology on its own can't innovate. Without the right talent  sustained digital transformation is not going to happen  leaving organizations unable to remain competitive in their industries "" continued Paglieri.The study is available for download here.About RandstadRandstad North America  Inc. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Randstad N.V.  the world's largest talent company and a partner of choice to clients.

In On-site Services  despite inflation  the post-Covid ramp-up in volumes  mitigation actions and pricing have helped us to improve our margins. Food inflation has remained high and is likely to remain so in the second half. In Benefits & Rewards Services  growth and profitability have been better than expected. To reflect the positive business momentum in the first half  we upgraded the Group organic growth guidance for Fiscal 2023 close to +11% while confirming our UOP guidance  expected to be close to 5.5% at constant rates. With the completion of the On-site Services reorganization into geographies  the Sodexo Leadership Team is totally focused on the execution of our strategic plan. The next major step for the Group is the proposed separation of OSS and BRS  that is driven by a strong strategic rationale. More focused  supported by a dedicated and empowered governance as well as an adequate capital structure  each entity would be in an even stronger position to pursue its own strategy  achieve its goals and realize its full potential. We confirm our mid-term financial objectives and are more than ever determined to meet them. I am confident in the capacity of the leadership teams of both entities to deliver the expected results. Finally  I would like to take a moment to warmly thank our teams for the strong progress that we have made this first half.”First half Fiscal 2023 Results up strongly First half Fiscal 2023 consolidated revenues were at 12.1 billion euros  up +17.8% year-on-year including a net contribution from acquisitions and disposals of -1.3% and a positive currency impact of +5.7%.

Bellon SA supports the plan and intends to continue playing a long-term controlling shareholder role in both businesses. The contemplated transaction is expected to take place during 2024 following the completion of several customary steps  including consultation of the employee representative bodies  and remains subject to market conditions. The Group confirms  and is more committed than ever to deliver  its mid-term guidance via the two separate entities. Detailed transaction terms will be presented at a later stage and submitted to the approval of Sodexo’s shareholders at an extraordinary shareholders’ meeting. Sodexo’s bondholders and other lenders will be consulted on the proposed transaction in due course. Strong strategic Rationale By separating the two businesses  Sodexo intends to accelerate value creation for all its stakeholders: As two pure players dedicated to their respective markets and clients  one in Food and Facilities Management services and the other in employee benefits and engagement  each would be strategically more focused;Empowered and dedicated governance would drive enhanced business and financial performance;Conducting each business independently would help create a focused workforce and optimize employer attractiveness and people retention through dedicated compensation mechanisms;Both companies would be established with the adequate capital structures providing them with the full financial flexibility to execute their growth strategies  including specific M&A.At separation  OSS and BRS would have capital structures consistent with a strong Investment Grade rating;At separation  OSS and BRS would have capital structures consistent with a strong Investment Grade rating; Already operating vastly as an independent company  the spin-off and listing of BRS is not expected to generate any material adverse effects and would result in one-off costs customary for a transaction of this nature;The two differentiated investment profiles  with their respective business drivers  KPIs and stock market benchmarks would ensure that they attract the best suited investors.

However  given the weight of the Benefit & Rewards activity in Brazil  and the high level of its margins relative to the Group  when the Brazilian real declines against the euro  it has a negative effect on the underlying operating profit margin due to a change in the mix of margins. Conversely  when the Brazilian real strengthens Group margins increase. 1€ = AVERAGE RATEH1 FY 2023 AVERAGE RATEH1 FY 2022 AVERAGE RATEH1 FY 2023 VS.

In Business & Administrations  organic growth was +16.7%  boosted by very strong demand for sporting and corporate events as well as the ongoing return to the office. This was somewhat offset by contract losses in Energy & Resources and Government & Agencies. In Healthcare & Seniors  organic growth of -8.3% was impacted by the end of the Testing Centers. The rest of the business was +8.6%  with the contribution of new openings  recovery in retail sales and solid occupancy in Seniors.

Relatively weak volume and new business growth in China was more than compensated by the contribution from net new wins in the other geographies. Business & Administrations was up +14.9%. Growth in Corporate Services and Energy & Resources has continued to be very strong due to a combination of strong volume increases in most regions except in Australia  due to previous year contract losses  and China  impacted by Covid-related site closures.

(2) The Group does not believe the accounting treatment introduced by IFRS 16 modifies the operating nature of its lease transactions. Accordingly  to ensure the Group’s performance measures continue to best reflect its operating performance  the Group considers repayments of lease liabilities as operating items impacting the Free cash flow  which integrates all lease payments (fixed or variable).To be consistent  the lease liabilities are not included in Net debt (treated as operating items). First half Fiscal 2023 Free cash outflow was 46 million euros against an outflow of 75 million euros in the previous period. First half Fiscal 2023 Operating cash flow improved to 808 million euros against 674 million euros in the previous period as a result of the significant improvement in the operating profit of the Group. The working capital outflow was similar to the previous year  at 517 million euros compared to an outflow of 481 million euros during First half Fiscal 2022. Net capital expenditure increased +47% to 234 million euros  representing 1.9% of revenues against 1.5% in the previous year.

The Fiscal 2022 dividend payment resulted in an outflow of 352 million euros compared to 294 million euros in the previous year  reflecting the 20% increase in the dividend per share. After taking into account Other changes  consolidated net debt increased by 601 million euros during the First half to reach 1 868 million euros at February 28  2023. 3.2 Acquisitions and disposals for the period First half Fiscal 2023 has been a quiet period for both acquisitions and disposals of non-core activities and geographies.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements Sodexo is a société anonyme (a form of limited liability company) registered in France  with its headquarters located in Issy-les-Moulineaux.Sodexo’s condensed interim consolidated financial statements for the six-month period from September 1  2022  to February 28  2023  were approved by the Board of Directors on April 4  2023. The numbers shown in the tables were prepared in thousands of euros and are presented in million euros (unless otherwise indicated). Note 1.Significant events 1 New On-site Services organization As announced in July 2022  the Group has reorganized its On-site Services activity with regions and countries consolidated into geographic zones led by three Zone Presidents  with the full responsibility of the Profit and Loss. The three geographic zones are North America  Europe and Rest of the World (including Asia-Pacific  Middle East  Africa  Latin America) In order to reflect the implementation of the new organization of On-site Services by geographic zone  fully effective from October 1  2022  the Group has redefined its operating segments as defined by IFRS 8 (corresponding until then to the global client segments and now represented by regions) and has updated its segment information accordingly. Thus  within On-site Services activity  the new operating segments after aggregation correspond to the following geographic zones: North America Europe (including the Continental Europe  France and United Kingdom & Ireland regions) Rest of the World (including Asia-Pacific/ Middle East/ Africa  Latin America (without Brazil) and Brazil).Benefits & Rewards Services  not impacted by the reorganization  is an operating segment on its own. For comparability purposes  the segment information of the previous period has been restated (see note 3.1). Furthermore  in accordance with IAS 36 ""Impairment of assets""  the reorganization of On-site Services activity has led the Group to reassess the level at which goodwill impairment tests are carried out. On-site Services goodwill have therefore been reallocated to each region (group of Cash Generating Units)  which corresponds to the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes (see note 4)  based on estimated relative value in use as of August 31  2022. Note 2.Basis of preparation of the financial statements 1 Accounting policies 1.1 General principles The condensed interim consolidated financial statements for the six months ended February 28  2023  have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 ""Interim Financial Reporting""  as published by the IASB and endorsed by the European Union. They do not include all the disclosures required for a complete set of annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the Sodexo Group for the fiscal year ended August 31  2022. The accounting policies applied by the Group in the condensed interim consolidated financial statements for the six months ended February 28  2023  are the same as those used in the annual consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended August 31  2022  with the exception of the specific requirements of IAS 34 (see note 2.2) and policies impacted by the reorganization of On-site Services (see notes 1.1  3.1 and 4). The texts effective as of September 1  2022  did not have a material impact on the interim consolidated financial statements of the Group. The Group has not applied any IFRSs that had not yet been approved by the European Union as of February 28  2023. The Group has not elected to early adopt any standards or interpretations whose application is not mandatory in Fiscal 2023. 2 Specific interim reporting requirements Income tax expense Income tax expense (current and deferred) in the condensed interim consolidated financial statements is computed by applying an estimated average annual tax rate for the current fiscal year to each tax reporting entity's pre-tax profit for the first half of the year as adjusted  where applicable  for the tax effect of any specific events that may have occurred during the period. The resulting deferred tax charge or benefit is recognized in deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial position. Post-employment and other long-term employee benefits The expense for post-employment and other long-term employee benefits is computed as one half of the annual charge estimated as of August 31  2022. The actuarial projections are updated to take into account any material changes to assumptions or one-off impacts (discount rates  applicable legislation...) during the six-month period. 3 Use of estimates The preparation of the condensed interim consolidated financial statements requires the management of Sodexo and its subsidiaries to make estimates and assumptions that may affect the amounts reported for assets  liabilities and contingent liabilities as of the date of preparation of the financial statements  and of revenues and expenses for the period.These estimates and judgments are updated continuously based on past experience and on various other factors considered reasonable in view of the situation prevailing as of February 28  2023 and are the basis for the assessments of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities. Final amounts may differ substantially from these estimates if assumptions or circumstances change. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions are the same as those described in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended August 31  2022 (valuation of current and non-current assets  assessment of deferred tax assets recoverability  valuation of financial assets measured at fair value  provisions – including uncertain tax treatments – and litigations  assessment of the lease term in measuring the lease liabilities and related right-of-use assets  post-employment defined benefit plan assets and liabilities  and share-based payments). Note 3.Segment information and other operating items 1 Segment information and revenue information Accounting principles and policiesIn accordance with IFRS 8 “Operating segments”  the segment information presented below has been prepared based on internal management data as monitored since the first quarter of Fiscal 2023 by the Group Leadership Team  which is Sodexo’s chief operating decision-maker: On-site Services and Benefits & Rewards Services.For On-site Services  Revenue and Underlying operating profit are followed by regions. These regions meet the definition of operating segments in IFRS 8.Sodexo’s operating segments and groups of operating segments are as follows:On-site Services: North America  Europe  which includes the Continental Europe  France and United Kingdom & Ireland regions; Rest of the World  including Asia-Pacific/Middle East/Africa  Latin America (without Brazil) and Brazil);Benefits & Rewards Services. The operating segments that have been aggregated within the On-site Services activity carry out similar operations – both in terms of type of services rendered and processes and methods used to deliver the services – and have similar economic characteristics (notably in terms of margins they generate).Segment assets and liabilities are not presented as they are not included in the chief operating decision-maker’s measurement of segment performance. 1.1 Segment information FIRST HALF FISCAL 2023(in million euros) ON-SITE SERVICES NORTH AMERICA EUROPE REST OF THE WORLD BENEFITS & REWARDS SERVICES ELIMINATIONS AND CORPORATE EXPENSES GROUP TOTAL Revenues (third-party) 11 581 5 499 4 027 2 055 504 — 12 085 Inter-segment sales (Group) — — — — 4 (4) — TOTAL REVENUES 11 581 5 499 4 027 2 055 508 (4) 12 085 Underlying operating profit* 593 365 157 71 162 (51) 704 * Including Group’s share of profit of companies accounted for using the equity method that directly contribute to the Group’s businessand excluding other operating income and expenses.

Note 4.Goodwill and impairment of non-current assets 1 Goodwill Accounting principles and policiesCash Generating UnitsAssets that do not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets  and hence cannot be tested for impairment individually  are grouped together in Cash Generating Units (CGUs).Impairment tests are performed at the level of the CGU or group of CGUs corresponding to the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored by the Group.Goodwill is analyzed per operating segment for On-site Services activity  as reflected in the new Group’s organizational structure (see notes 1.1 and 3.1)  and per geographical area for Benefits & Rewards Services activity:On-site Services activity: North America  France  United Kingdom & Ireland  Continental Europe  Asia-Pacific/Middle East/ Africa  Latin America (without Brazil)  Brazil;Benefits & Rewards Services activity: Americas  Europe  Rest of the world.Goodwill is not tested for impairment at a higher level than the operating segments before aggregation for segment reporting.The assets allocated to each CGU or group of CGUs comprise: goodwill  which is allocated when the CGU or group of CGUs is likely to benefit from the business combination;other intangible assets  property  plant and equipment  client investments  right-of-use assets relating to leases and net working capital. Changes in goodwill during the period were as follows: (in million euros) SEPTEMBER 1  2022 INCREASES/CHARGES REVERSALS WITH UTILIZATION REVERSALS WITHOUT UTILIZATION CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT AND OTHER CHANGES IN SCOPE OF CONSOLIDATION FEBRUARY 28  2023 North America 2 662 — — — — (208) 2 454 France 505 — — — — — 505 United Kingdom & Ireland 671 7 — — — (16) 662 Continental Europe 800 — — — — (24) 776 Europe 1 976 7 — — — (40) 1 943 Asia-Pacific  Middle East & Africa 703 3 — — — (46) 660 Latin America 379 — — — — (7) 372 Brazil 229 — — — — (16) 213 Rest of the World 1 311 3 — — — (69) 1 245 ON-SITE SERVICES TOTAL 5 949 10 — — — (317) 5 642 BENEFITS & REWARDS SERVICES 663 — — — — (19) 644 TOTAL 6 612 10 — — — (336) 6 286 2 Impairment of non-current assets During the first half of Fiscal 2023  the Group carried out a review of impairment triggers likely to lead to a decrease in the recoverable value of its tangible and intangible assets. In particular  Sodexo analyzed the performance of its regions (groups of CGUs at which goodwill is monitored) during the first half compared to the estimates used during the Fiscal 2022 annual closing for impairment testing. The Group has also analyzed the evolution since August 31  2022  of the main financial parameters (discount rate). The Group’s management has concluded that there was no evidence of triggers indicating a decrease in the recoverable value of its operating segments as of February 28  2023  compared to August 31  2022. The annual review of the carrying amount of goodwill and other intangible assets will be realized during the Second Half Fiscal 2023.

As a reminder  in Fiscal 2017  Sodexo Pass do Brasil received a tax reassessment notice for fiscal years 2010 to 2012 challenging the deductibility for tax purposes of the goodwill amortization  with 150% penalties and late payment interest. The reassessment amounted to 573 million Brazilian real  i.e.  111 million euros as of August 31  2022 (29 million euros in principle  43 million euros in penalties and 40 million euros in late payment interest). The Group firmly disputed this reassessment  which the Brazilian tax authorities originally envisaged during a previous tax audit covering the fiscal years 2008 and 2009 but then abandoned  as it considered that the tax amortization of goodwill was valid  and that the procedure therefore had a strong chance of succeeding in its favor. This dispute was decided on August 14  2018  before the competent administrative court (CARF). The court ruled in favor of Sodexo Pass do Brasil  considering that the goodwill and corresponding tax amortization were legitimately recognized on the acquisition of VR. This ruling in favor of Sodexo Pass do Brasil was confirmed by the Superior Court of Appeal (CSRF) at a hearing on September 13  2022 and notified in writing to the Group on October 27  2022. The Federal Tax Administration has already taken note of the decision  without expressing any request for clarification  thus definitively ending the dispute in favor of Sodexo Pass do Brasil. During Fiscal 2021  the subsidiary Sodexo do Brasil Comercial also received a tax reassessment notice mainly linked to the tax deductibility of the amortization of goodwill recognized on the purchase of Puras. The reassessment covers the period from 2015 to 2017 and amounts to 205 million Brazilian real to date  i.e.  37 million euros as of February 28  2023 (of which 9 million euros in principal and 28 million euros in penalties and late payment interests). In August 2021  the competent administrative Court ruled in favor of Sodexo do Brasil Comercial but the Brazilian tax authorities appealed this first instance decision. However  the Group considers that the risks of a change in the decision are low  considering  on the one hand  that it has strong arguments to contest the tax reassessment and  on the other hand  the recent favorable decision of the CSRF ending the dispute between Sodexo Pass do Brasil and the Brazilian tax authorities on the same issue mentioned above. The goodwill amount has been fully amortized. The tax savings generated by this tax depreciation were offset in the consolidated accounts of the Group by a deferred tax expense of the same amount for each of the related financial periods  in accordance with the IFRS rules. The balance of the related deferred tax liability amounts to 26 million euros as of February 28  2023. In addition  Sodexo and its main competitors have a different interpretation from that of the Brazilian tax administration on the deductibility of PIS/COFINS on certain purchases made at a zero rate. Several proceedings are underway  either at the initiative of the tax authorities  which have notified Sodexo do Brasil Comercial of an adjustment in respect of credits recognized in 2016 of 9 million euro (including penalties and interest for late payment)  or at the initiative of the company  which has filed several claims in the courts. One of these proceedings initiated by Sodexo do Brasil Comercial was suspended  on the initiative of the judge  until the Supreme Court's decision on another company's case. In February 2023  the Supreme Court issued its decision  which was unfavorable to the company concerned: the judges essentially ruled that ordinary law may provide for limitations on the use of PIS/COFINS credits  provided that such law respects all constitutional principles  in particular equality of treatment of taxpayers and free competition. This decision  which should not be considered automatically unfavorable for the individual cases of each taxpayer  does not affect the appeals filed by Sodexo  which will continue to follow their respective courses. The company believes that it has different and strong enough arguments to ultimately succeed in court on this issue. After consultation with its advisors  Sodexo considers that its chances of success in these proceedings are good and that to date the risk of an outflow of resources associated with the PIS/COFINS credits deducted since 2016 remains unlikely; therefore  no provision has been recorded in the consolidated financial statements as of February 28  2023. Dispute with the French competition authority On October 9  2015  the company Octoplus filed a complaint with the French Competition Authority (Autorité de la concurrence) concerning several French meal voucher issuers  including Sodexo Pass France. Following the hearing of the parties concerned in April and July 2016  the Competition Authority decided on October 6  2016  to continue the proceedings  without ordering interim measures against Sodexo Pass France. On February 27  2019  the prosecution services sent their final investigation report to Sodexo Pass France. In its response filed on April 29  2019  the Group contested both of the grievances notified by the Authority (exchange of information and foreclosure of the meal voucher market through the Centrale de Règlement des Titres). On December 17  2019  the French Competition Authority ruled against the meal voucher issuers and fined Sodexo Pass France  jointly and severally with Sodexo S.A.  126 million euros. This decision was formally notified to Sodexo Pass France and Sodexo S.A. on February 6  2020. Sodexo vigorously contests this decision considering that it demonstrates a flawed understanding of the practices in question and of the way in which the market operates. The Group has therefore lodged an appeal against the decision with the Paris Court of Appeal. The hearing was held on November 18  2021  and the Court of Appeal is expected to render its decision on May 25  2023. Given the significant impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the Group's activities and performance  Sodexo obtained a decision from the State collection services allowing it to defer payment of the fine until December 15  2021  without any penalty being due  subject to providing a bank guarantee  and from that date a monthly settlement plan until January 2023. An asset was recognized in ""Other operating receivables "" as a counterpart of the sums paid.After consultation with its legal advisers  the Group considers that it has solid arguments capable of resulting in the reversal or revision of the decision of the Competition Authority. As a result  no provision has been made for this dispute. French tax reassessment Sodexo S.A. received in December 2021 a notification for a proposed tax reassessment concerning fiscal years 2016  2017 and 2018. Another proposed adjustment notice was issued by the French tax authorities in December 2022 for fiscal years 2019  2020 and 2021 in order to replicate certain adjustments it had initiated during the previous tax audit. The Company has assessed the risk associated with these procedures and  after review with its tax advisors  considers that it has strong arguments to contest the proposed reassessments. Other disputes Group subsidiaries can also be subject to tax audits certain of which may result in reassessments. Main disputes are described above. In each case  the risk is assessed by management and its advisors  and any charges deemed probable are recorded as provisions or tax liabilities. The Group is not aware of any other governmental  judicial  or arbitral proceedings which are outstanding or threatened and which may have  or have had in the past 12 months  material effects on the Group’s financial position or profitability. Sodexo is also involved in other legal proceedings arising in the normal course of its business. The Group does not anticipate that any potential related liabilities will in the aggregate be material to its activities or to its consolidated financial position.

This shareholding does not give the Group significant influence over Bellon SA  as voting rights attached to Bellon SA shares cannot be exercised by Sofinsod  in accordance with the provisions of Article L. 233-31 of Code de Commerce. There are no potential conflicts of interest between the duties to Sodexo of members of the Board of Directors or senior management and their private interests. In particular the Pierre and Danielle Bellon Family controls 72.6% of the family holding company Bellon SA. Mr. and Mrs. Pierre Bellon and their children entered into an agreement in June 2015 to prevent their direct descendants from freely disposing of their Bellon SA shares for 50 years. Bellon SA’s only asset is its holding in Sodexo; Bellon SA has no intention of selling this holding to a third party. In accordance with IFRS 9  this investment is measured at its fair value  determined in accordance with IFRS 13. The valuation of the fair value of the investment depends  among other things  on the revalued net asset value (NAV) of Bellon SA which has limited debt and holds no assets other than shares of Sodexo S.A. These shares are valued at their closing share price for the calculation of the NAV of Bellon SA. Furthermore  the valuation method used by management (Level 3 of the hierarchy defined by IFRS 13) incorporates the illiquidity implied by the characteristics of the holding's ownership structure (discount to net asset value of Bellon SA estimated at 40% as of February 28  2023  and August 31  2022). As of February 28  2023  the fair value of the investment is assessed at 642 million euros (541 million euros as of August 31  2022)  and its change since the opening of the period has been recorded in other non-recyclable items of comprehensive income (OCI). Restricted cash and financial assets related to the benefits & rewards services activityRestricted cash corresponds to 843 million euros of “Financial assets related to the Benefits & Rewards Services activity” primarily in funds set aside to comply with regulations governing the issuance of service vouchers in France (267 million euros)  Romania (153 million euros)  Belgium (153 million euros)  India (122 million euros) and China (72 million euros). The funds remain the property of the Group but are subject to restrictions on their use. They may not be used for any purpose other than to reimburse affiliates and must be kept separate from the Group’s unrestricted cash. Restricted cash is invested in interest-bearing instruments. 4 Borrowings Changes in borrowings during First Half Fiscal 2023 were as follows: (in million euros) AUGUST 31  2022 INCREASES REPAYMENTS DISCOUNTING EFFECTSAND OTHER CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT CHANGES IN SCOPE OF CONSOLIDATION FEBRUARY 28  2023 Bond issues (1) 5 600 40 (16) (9) (77) — 5 538 Commercial paper and bank borrowings (2) 1 250 (252) — — 2 1 Other borrowings 108 — (5) — (3) 21 120 TOTAL BORROWINGS EXCLUDING DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 5 709 290 (273) (9) (80) 23 5 659 Net fair value of derivative financial instruments 33 3 1 10 (7) — 40 TOTAL BORROWINGS 5 742 293 (272) 1 (87) 23 5 699 (1) As of February 28  2023  accrued interest on bond issues represented 34 million euros (13 million euros as of August 31  2022).

Copies will also be available at Ipsen’s headquarters – 65 quai Georges Gorse  92100 Boulogne-Billancourt  France.The following documents are incorporated into the 2022 Universal Registration Document:Annual Financial Report Board of Directors’ Report on Corporate Governance.IpsenIpsen is a global  mid-sized biopharmaceutical company focused on transformative medicines in Oncology  Rare Disease and Neuroscience. With total sales of €3.0bn in FY 2022  Ipsen sells medicines in over 100 countries. Alongside its external-innovation strategy  the Company’s research and development efforts are focused on its innovative and differentiated technological platforms located in the heart of leading biotechnological and life-science hubs: Paris-Saclay  France; Oxford  U.K.; Cambridge  U.S.; Shanghai  China. Ipsen has around 5 000 colleagues worldwide and is listed in Paris (Euronext: IPN) and in the U.S. through a Sponsored Level I American Depositary Receipt program (ADR: IPSEY). For more information  visit ipsen.com .Forward Looking StatementThe forward-looking statements  objectives and targets contained herein are based on Ipsen’s management strategy  current views and assumptions. Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law. Ipsen’s business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers.

By region  sales in the United States were stable at €4 202k  but were impacted by a slowdown in activity in the second half of the year due to difficulties in the supply of contrast agent (fluorescein)  which significantly affected the number of Cellvizio procedures. The recovery of activity in EMEA & ROW in the second half of the year enabled the Company to record a 47% increase in sales in this region during the year 2022  offsetting the decline in sales in the Asia-Pacific region due to the signing of the partnership with Tasly Pharmaceutical.The gross margin rate for 2022 sets at 73.3%  nearly stable compared to 74.2% at the end of 2021 (-87 points)  supported by a still favorable sales mix in 2022  in spite of supply chain and inflation challenges throughout the year.Operating expenses  excluding cost of goods sold  decreased by €2 788k year-on-year to €15 089k. This decrease is partly explained by the reduction in Sales & Marketing expenses (-24%) and administrative expenses (-24%).The increase in R&D expenses mainly results from the end of capitalization in 2022 linked to the development of the 3rd generation of Cellvizio platform since its commercialization in October 2021. Concurrently  Mauna Kea received a last subsidy in the framework of PERSEE project in 2021  which was accounted in R&D.The operating loss improved to -€9 063k  compared to -€12 218k at the end of 2021  reflecting the first results of the restructuring carried out by Mauna Kea Technologies and the reallocation of resources within the R&D department.After taking into account all of these items and a financial result of -€2 117k  the net loss at December 31  2022 was -€11 180k  reduced by €2 265k compared to the previous year.At December 31  2022  the Company had a cash balance of €3.1 million and total liabilities of €26.9 million  compared with €11.9 million in cash and €26.9 million in total liabilities at December 31  2021. The change in cash and cash equivalents during the period can be broken down as follows:€8.8 million of cash consumed by operating activities €0.06 million of cash used in investment activities €0.1 million in cash flow from financing activities.The Company is assuming that it will continue to operate as a going concern given: its cash level at December  2022 at €3.1 million and its cash position increased to €9.1 million at January 26  2023  following the receipt of the first payment from the joint venture with Tasly. Mauna Kea will receive a payment of €2.3 million ($2.5 million1) in the coming weeks following the achievement of some of the milestones of the contract. The Company has the ability to re-establish an equity financing line  which could enable it to raise a minimum €2.5 million over the next 12 months.In addition  and in accordance with its new business strategy  the Company is pursuing several financial and strategic partnerships  which could lead to additional financing to extend its cash horizon to finance the development of its activities beyond April 2024.The consolidated financial statements for the year 2022 have been audited and will be available before April 30  2023 on the Company's website  in the Investors section.Selected highlight of the second half of 2022Successful clinical study on the prediction of major adverse events in patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) using CellvizioMauna Kea Technologies announced the success of a long-term prospective clinical study on predicting remission or relapse in patients with chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) using confocal laser endomicroscopy with Cellvizio. The results were published in Gastroenterology  the flagship journal of the American Gastroenterological Association and a very high impact factor journal. The study prospectively showed that the predictive value of intestinal barrier healing assessed dynamically and functionally by confocal laser endomicroscopy (Cellvizio®) was far superior to that of endoscopic and histologic remission in predicting long-term remission or relapse in a large cohort of IBD patients in clinical remission.Post-closing eventsProgress of the Joint Venture between Mauna Kea Technologies and Tasly PharmaceuticalSince November 7th  the Joint Venture between Mauna Kea Technologies and Tasly Pharmaceutical is legally incorporated as Tasly Mauna Kea Medical Engineering Technology Co. Ltd2. The shares of the JV have not been recognized in Mauna Kea’s scope of consolidation as of December 31  2022  as the transfer of ownership was subject to the payment of capital from Tasly  which was made in January 2023. Upon completion of the contributions by the companies  Mauna Kea will receive a stake of 49% in the JV  and will sell 4.9% to Cenponts as compensation of its strategic advisory services.Based on the signed agreements between Mauna Kea and the JV in December 2022:- The Company received an initial payment of €6.0 million (USD 6.5 million3) in January 2023.- The Company will receive a payment of €2.3 million (USD 2.5 million1) in the coming weeks following completion of certain contractual milestones.- Commitment of the JV to purchase minimum quantities of Cellvizio systems and probes for 5 years.Bankruptcy of the Silicon Valley BankOn March 10  2023  the Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) took control of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB)  which was on the verge of implosion due to massive customer withdrawals. SVB is a financial partner of Mauna Kea Inc. which has a current account with the bank. The account continues to operate normally and there is no risk identified by Mauna Kea following the FDIC takeover and subsequent acquisition.Upcoming events:Financial publication: revenues for the 1 st quarter 2023  on April 20  2023  after market closeAnnual General Meeting  on June 2  2023***About Mauna Kea TechnologiesMauna Kea Technologies is a global medical device company that manufactures and sells Cellvizio®  the real-time in vivo cellular imaging platform.

In doing so  BNP Paribas secures a first-mover advantage and is about to set a new standard in setting up SEPA Direct Debit payments.By combining the e-signature of SEPA mandates with account validation using Open Banking  Worldline enhances its SEPA Payment Suite and proposes an innovative extension  using Strong Customer Authentication and providing advanced security that eliminates the risk of IBAN misuse during the mandate signature process.Not only will companies and merchants benefit from this solution as it is a secure and low-risk payment method  but the consumer will also benefit from a better user experience.Bruno Mellado  Global Head of Payments and Receivables at BNP Paribas: “We were seeking an innovative solution to reduce IBAN fraud in SEPA Direct Debits. We found it with the new account validation functionality of Worldline’s SEPA Payment Suite which is based on the latest innovative technologies through Open Banking opportunities. By implementing it in our existing SEPA Mandate and Direct Debit solution EasyCollect  the risk of SDD fraud will be reduced and customer loyalty will be strengthened  which is a huge benefit for our clients and their customers”.Alessandro Baroni  Head of Financial Services at Worldline: ‘’Being one of the largest Open Banking providers  we are continuously working on innovative solutions that help our customers to grow and improve their business.
