You can exercise your right to vote in the following ways: If you are a certificated shareholder  by attending the AGM in person or by appointing (either electronically or by returning a completed Form of Proxy) the chairman of the AGM or another person as a proxy to vote on your behalf; If you hold your interests in the Company's Shares through a participant account in the Euroclear Bank System (the EB System ) by (i) sending electronic voting instructions to Euroclear Bank; or (ii) sending a proxy voting instruction to Euroclear Bank to appoint a third party (other than Euroclear Nominees Limited (i.e. the nominee of Euroclear Bank) ( Euroclear Nominees ) or the chairman of the AGM) to attend and vote at the AGM; or If you hold your interests in the Company's Shares as CREST Depositary Instruments ( CDIs ) in the CREST system by (i) sending electronic voting instructions to Euroclear Bank via Broadridge Financial Solutions Limited ( Broadridge ); or (ii) appointing a proxy via the Broadridge Global Proxy Voting service. In all cases attendance at the AGM will be subject to all appropriate health and/or safety measures as the Directors may in their absolute discretion determine from time to time  and in any individual case  to be necessary or desirable at  during or prior to the AGM to ensure the safety of any attendees and others involved with it. The information set out in this this document in relation to voting procedures for persons who hold their interests in the Shares of the Company as Belgian law rights through the EB System or as CDIs is for guidance only. Such persons should consult with their stockbroker or other intermediary at the earliest opportunity for further information on the processes and timelines for submitting proxies and voting instructions for the AGM through the respective systems. For voting services offered by custodians holding Irish corporate securities directly with Euroclear Bank  please contact your custodian. Shareholders holding shares in certificated form Shareholders whose names appear on the Register of Members of the Company (i.e. those Shareholders who hold their Shares in certificated form and who therefore do not hold their interests in Shares through the Euroclear Bank System (the EB System) or as CREST Depositary Interests (CDIs) through CREST) will receive a Form of Proxy which must be completed  signed and returned to the Company's Registrar Computershare Investor Services (Ireland) Limited in accordance with the instructions printed on the form as soon as possible but in any event so as to be received by the Company's Registrar no later than 11.00am on Tuesday  9 May 2023. The completion and return of a Form of Proxy will not preclude Shareholders from attending and voting in person at the AGM  or any adjournment thereof  should you wish to do so and subject to any restrictions in place due to government health guidelines. Shareholders who have any queries in relation to the proxy voting process should contact the Registrars (Tel. +353 1 447 5483). Further Information for Euroclear Bank Participants Persons who hold their interests in the Company's Shares through a participant account in the EB System (EB Participants) can submit proxy appointments (including voting instructions) electronically in the manner described in the document issued by Euroclear Bank in February 2021 and entitled ""Euroclear Bank as issuer CSD for Irish corporate securities"" (the Euroclear Bank Service Description). EB Participants can either send: electronic voting instructions to instruct Euroclear Nominees Limited (i.e. the nominee of Euroclear Bank) ( Euroclear Nominees ) to either itself or by appointing the chairman of the AGM as proxy: vote in favour of all or a specific resolution(s); vote against all or a specific resolution(s); withhold their vote for all or a specific resolution(s); or give discretionary vote to the chairman of the AGM for all or a specific resolution(s); or a proxy voting instruction to appoint a third party (other than Euroclear Nominees or the chairman of the AGM) (who may be a corporate representative or the EB Participant themselves) to attend the AGM  subject to any restrictions on attendance due to health and /or safety guidelines  and vote for the number of Shares specified in the proxy voting instruction by providing Euroclear Bank with the proxy details as requested in its notification (e.g. proxy first name  proxy last name  proxy address  nationality code). There is no facility to offer a letter of representation/appoint a corporate representative other than through the submission of third-party proxy appointment instructions. EB Participants may cast a split vote for the same resolution. To do so  the EB Participant will need to send a separate instruction for each chosen vote direction (in favour  against or abstain) for the given resolution. EB Participants will also be able to cast split votes across the different resolutions (i.e. vote in favour of some resolutions or against other resolutions) It is expected that Euroclear Bank will  wherever practical  aim to have a voting instruction deadline of one (1) hour prior to the Company's proxy appointment deadline  which  in the case of the AGM  would be a deadline of 10.00am on Tuesday  9 May 2023. Voting instructions cannot be changed or cancelled after Euroclear Bank's voting deadline. EB Participants are strongly encouraged to familiarise themselves with the arrangements with Euroclear Bank  including the voting deadlines and procedures. For voting services offered by custodians holding Irish corporate securities directly with Euroclear Bank  please contact your custodian. Further Information for the holders of CDIs (CDI Holders) CDI Holders should consult with their stockbroker or other intermediary at the earliest opportunity for further information on the processes and timelines for submitting proxy votes for the AGM through the respective systems. Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited (EUI)  the operator of CREST  has arranged for voting instructions relating to the CDIs held in CREST to be received via a third-party service provider  Broadridge Financial Solutions Limited (Broadridge). Further details on this service are set out on the ""All you need to know about SRD II"" in Euroclear UK & Ireland webpage (see section CREST International Service - Proxy voting). If you are a CDI Holder  you will be required to make use of the EUI proxy voting service facilitated by Broadridge Global Proxy Voting service in order to receive AGM announcements and send back voting instructions  as required. To facilitate client set up  if you hold CDIs and wish to participate in the proxy voting service  you will need to complete the AGMs and Voting Client Set- up Form (CRT408) at https://my.euroclear.com/users/en/login.html?resource=%2Fcontent%2Fdam%2Feuroclear%2FOperational%2F 2 EUI%2FForms%2FCRT408%2520Meeting%2520Voting%2520Client%2520Set- Up%2520Form.xlsx&$$login$$=%24%24login%24%24&j_reason=unknown&j_reason_code=unknown Completed application forms should be returned to EUI by an authorised signatory with another relevant authorised signatory copied in for verification purposes using the following email address: eui.srd2@euroclear.com. Fully completed and returned applications forms will be shared with Broadridge by EUI. This will enable Broadridge to contact you and share further detailed information on the service offering and initiate the process for granting your access to the Broadridge platform. Once CDI Holders have access to the Broadridge platform  they can complete and submit proxy appointments (including voting instructions) electronically. Broadridge will process and deliver proxy voting instructions received from CDI Holders by the Broadridge voting deadline date to Euroclear Bank  by their cut-off and to agreed market requirements. Broadridge's deadline will be earlier than Euroclear Bank's voting instruction deadline. Alternatively  a CDI Holder can send a third-party proxy voting instruction through the Broadridge platform in order to appoint a third-party (who may be a corporate representative or the CDI Holder themselves) to attend and vote at the AGM for the number of Shares specified in the proxy instruction (subject to the Broadridge voting deadline). There is no facility to offer a letter of representation/appoint a corporate representative other than through the submission of third-party proxy appointment instructions through Broadridge. Broadridge's voting deadline is expected to be earlier than Euroclear Bank's voting instruction deadline as set out above. Voting instructions cannot be changed or cancelled after Broadridge's voting deadline. CDI Holders are strongly encouraged to familiarise themselves with the arrangements with Broadridge  including the voting deadlines and procedures and to take  as soon as possible  any further actions required by Broadridge before they can avail of this voting service. Shareholders may also submit questions in writing by sending an email to agm2023@icg.ieor by completing and submitting the electronic form on the Company's website at icg.ie/investors/general-meetings/  together with evidence of their shareholding to be received by 5.00PM on Monday 8 May 2023.

With the proposed record date  the dividend is expected to be paid out through Euroclear Sweden AB on Friday  5 May 2023. The last day of trading in the company's shares to be included in the right to dividend is Thursday  27 April 2023.The Board's statement regarding whether the proposed dividend is justifiedAccording to Rottneros' dividend policy  dividends shall be 30-50 percent of the previous year's profit after tax. Rottneros' financial goal imply that the company must have an equity ratio exceeding 50 percent and an available liquidity corresponding to at least ten percent of the group's annual turnover.The Board is of the opinion that the proposed dividend to the shareholders does not constitute an obstacle for the company to meet its short or long-term obligations  while the company's financial position allows for continued investments and expansion of the business.The proposed dividend of in total SEK 1.40 per share  equivalent to MSEK 2141  which is 38 percent of the result for 2022 after tax  represents 20 percent of the parent company's equity and 9 percent of the group's equity at the balance sheet date of 31 December 2022. The dividend reduces the parent company's equity ratio from 63 percent to 58 percent and the group's equity ratio from 66 percent to 64 percent. The equity ratio is considered to be sufficient.Both the parent company and group companies are deemed to be able to maintain good liquidity even after dividend in accordance with the Board's proposal.The Board is  in the light of the above  of the opinion that the proposed dividend is justified with regards to the requirements that the nature  scope and risks of the business place upon the size of the company's and group's equity and upon the company's and group's consolidation needs  liquidity and financial position in general.The proposed dividend can be justified by reference to what is stated in chapter 17  section 3  paragraphs 2-3 of the Swedish Companies Act.Vallvik  March 2023The Board of Directors Rottneros AB1 No dividend is paid on the company's holding of treasury shares.

Audit reports are in the process of being issued.Consolidated data - in € millions 2022 2021 Var. in % Revenue 990.51 922.6 +7.4% EBITDA 81.3 117.1 -30.6% Current operating income 38.6 75.2 -48.7% Current operating margin 3.9% 8.2% -4.3 pts Operating income 37.7 70.4 -46.4% Financial income (11.4) (2.2) - Net result (group share) 11.1 51.2 -78.3% Net margin 1.1 % 5.5% -4.4 ptsACTIVITY UP +7.4%In an automotive production market that is slightly recovering  although still subject to strong tensions over supplies of raw materials and electronic components  the AKWEL Group ends 2022 with a +7.4% annual increase in turnover compared with 2021. This remains around 10% lower than 2019  the last financial year before the health crisis and the fall in global markets. On a like-for-like basis  the increase in annual turnover was +11.3%.DELAYED IMPACTS OF INFLATION ON SALE PRICESThe delay in the impacts of increases in purchase prices on sale prices  combined with the additional costs generated by supply pressures  weighed heavily on the Group’s results in 2022. Gross operating surplus (GOS) was therefore down by -30.6% to €81.3m. Price increases on the main items (raw materials  components  energy  transport and labour costs) represented an additional cost of nearly €85m. About 55% of these increases were passed on over the course of the year  with an improving trend in the second half (60%).Current operating income amounted to €38.6m  representing a current operating margin of 3.9%  down 4.3 points compared to 2021. As announced in the first half of 2022  the first application of IAS 29 (“Financial Reporting in Hyper-inflationary Economies”) has a significant (non-cash) impact of -€14.3m  for a financial result of -€11.4m. After a tax charge of €14.6m (vs €16.3m in 2021)  net income Group share stands at €11.1m.Story continuesNET CASH POSITION UP AT €113.7mWith a self-financing capacity of €47.0m and WCR down by €1.9m  the business generated cash-flow of €48.9m. In view of an investment flow of €33.2m (compared with €30.0m in 2021)  free cash-flow stood at €15.7m  leading to a positive net cash position of €113.7m at the end of the financial year (including rental obligations)  compared with €98.2m at the end of 2021. The distribution of a dividend of €0.30 per share for 2022 will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders to be held on Thursday 25 May 2023.SLIGHT GROWTH EXPECTED IN 2023For the 2023 financial year  AKWEL remains cautious with regard to the sector’s recovery forecasts and anticipates a slight increase in turnover  in a continuing context of very limited visibility on the global automotive market due to economic and geopolitical tensions. The Group anticipates continued tension over production costs and will work to continue to improve the rate at which they are passed on to customers.From an extra-financial perspective  the Group has set itself ambitious objectives for 2028  whether environmental (for example  a 40% reduction in CO2 emissions)  social (reduction from 4.09 to 2.8 in the frequency rate of workplace accidents)  as well as in terms of customer satisfaction (two-thirds reduction in warranty returns) and responsible purchasing  following increased initiatives undertaken this year.Next press release: Turnover for the first quarter of 2023  on 04 May 2023  after markets close.An independent  family-owned group listed on the Euronext Paris Stock Exchange  AKWEL is an automotive and HGV equipment and systems manufacturer specialising in fluid management  mechanisms  and structural components for electric vehicles.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance.

Audit reports are in the process of being issued.Consolidated data - in € millions 2022 2021 Var. in % Revenue 990.51 922.6 +7.4% EBITDA 81.3 117.1 -30.6% Current operating income 38.6 75.2 -48.7% Current operating margin 3.9% 8.2% -4.3 pts Operating income 37.7 70.4 -46.4% Financial income (11.4) (2.2) - Net result (group share) 11.1 51.2 -78.3% Net margin 1.1 % 5.5% -4.4 ptsACTIVITY UP +7.4%In an automotive production market that is slightly recovering  although still subject to strong tensions over supplies of raw materials and electronic components  the AKWEL Group ends 2022 with a +7.4% annual increase in turnover compared with 2021. This remains around 10% lower than 2019  the last financial year before the health crisis and the fall in global markets. On a like-for-like basis  the increase in annual turnover was +11.3%.DELAYED IMPACTS OF INFLATION ON SALE PRICESThe delay in the impacts of increases in purchase prices on sale prices  combined with the additional costs generated by supply pressures  weighed heavily on the Group’s results in 2022.

In doing so  BNP Paribas secures a first-mover advantage and is about to set a new standard in setting up SEPA Direct Debit payments.By combining the e-signature of SEPA mandates with account validation using Open Banking  Worldline enhances its SEPA Payment Suite and proposes an innovative extension  using Strong Customer Authentication and providing advanced security that eliminates the risk of IBAN misuse during the mandate signature process.Not only will companies and merchants benefit from this solution as it is a secure and low-risk payment method  but the consumer will also benefit from a better user experience.Bruno Mellado  Global Head of Payments and Receivables at BNP Paribas: “We were seeking an innovative solution to reduce IBAN fraud in SEPA Direct Debits. We found it with the new account validation functionality of Worldline’s SEPA Payment Suite which is based on the latest innovative technologies through Open Banking opportunities. By implementing it in our existing SEPA Mandate and Direct Debit solution EasyCollect  the risk of SDD fraud will be reduced and customer loyalty will be strengthened  which is a huge benefit for our clients and their customers”.Alessandro Baroni  Head of Financial Services at Worldline: ‘’Being one of the largest Open Banking providers  we are continuously working on innovative solutions that help our customers to grow and improve their business. We look forward to continuing our long-term partnership with BNP Paribas Cash Management and further build on future products and initiatives’’.,negative,0.0,0.16,0.84,mixed,0.43,0.1,0.46,True,English,"['Sepa Direct Debits', 'BNP Paribas', 'Iban fraud', 'Worldline', 'Single Euro Payments Area', 'largest Open Banking providers', 'BNP Paribas Cash Management', 'Open Banking-based account validation', 'SEPA Direct Debit transactions', 'new account validation functionality', 'SEPA Direct Debit payments', 'Open Banking opportunities', 'automated payment method', 'existing white-label product', 'SEPA Payment Suite', 'low-risk payment method', 'SEPA Direct Debits', 'Direct Debit solution', 'Account Validation solution', 'Strong Customer Authentication', 'existing SEPA Mandate', 'latest innovative technologies', 'mandate signature process', 'SEPA mandates', 'new standard', 'payments services', 'customer loyalty', 'electronic signature', 'innovative extension', 'innovative solution', 'global leader', 'additional countries', 'recurring invoices', 'fraudulent use', 'recent years', 'first-mover advantage', 'advanced security', 'user experience', 'Bruno Mellado', 'huge benefit', 'Alessandro Baroni', 'Financial Services', 'long-term partnership', 'future products', 'IBAN misuse', 'Global Head', 'IBAN fraud', 'SDD fraud', 'Source', 'Worldline', 'WLN', 'Germany', 'Italy', 'France', 'months', 'one-off', 'order', 'someone', 'pattern', 'companies', 'merchants', 'secure', 'consumer', 'Receivables', 'EasyCollect', 'clients', 'customers', 'business', 'initiatives']",2023-04-06,2023-04-07,finextra.com

Despite the recent rise in digitization and technology adoption  Randstad found that one-third of IT leaders are less confident in their ability to deliver on key initiatives. Respondents cited technology issues such as poor system performance  outdated and lack of technology as barriers to their success.Randstad surveyed over 750 IT decision-makers in both the United States and Canada to learn more about their priorities as many companies look to modernize their technology and focus on critical investments. An overwhelming majority  90 percent of respondents  believe that technology is vital to their company heading in the right direction. Yet nearly half (44 percent) of IT leaders believe technology is only adequately or even underfunded at their organization.The study also found that while Canadian leaders had more confidence in their results than those in the US  there was more concern about the impact of talent shortages on their businesses. Twenty-one percent of Canadian IT decision-makers believed the shortages were extremely impactful on business goals versus 7 percent of US IT decision-makers.Other key findings include the following:Top concerns for IT leaders include cyber vulnerabilities  supply chain disruption  inflation and other economic factors.Companies are still falling behind in using data for business decisions as over 60 percent do not rely strongly on their internal data and analytics.Skill shortages are costly for businesses as CIOs cite a lack of skills as the biggest hindrance to digital transformation. These shortages have also been the cause of over 42 percent of organizations seeking external help.""We believe that this research helps pinpoint what's top of mind for IT leaders as they look to deliver on goals in organizations that are increasingly overwhelmed by complexity. To do this  leaders must recognize the need for talent-driven digital solutions in an environment where technology is no longer just a supporting function in an organization; it's now driving businesses and economies "" said Graig Paglieri  CEO  Randstad Technologies  North America""Digital transformation is set to remain at the heart of businesses during the next few decades  and urgent issues like talent scarcity and skills shortages have to be addressed. Technology on its own can't innovate. Without the right talent  sustained digital transformation is not going to happen  leaving organizations unable to remain competitive in their industries "" continued Paglieri.The study is available for download here.About RandstadRandstad North America  Inc. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Randstad N.V.  the world's largest talent company and a partner of choice to clients.

The non-IFRS financial measures presented are measures used by management to monitor the underlying performance of the business and operations and  have therefore not been audited or reviewed.

As a specialist in omnichannel payment solutions  the company has been able to adapt and meet the ever-changing needs of merchants in a wide range of sectors to support their growth  throughout Europe.In France  the Online to In-store unified commerce offer has been very successful in the retail sector  with a +44% increase in revenues generated in points of sale (POS) for the year compared to 2021.HiPay has also increased its market share in the iGaming sector. In addition to strengthening its position in the online fashion sector  the company made an incursion into the supermarket sector in Portugal  where payment volumes also increased. In Italy  HiPay continues to grow in new high-performance sectors such as InsurTech and travel.Over the years 2020 to 2022  growth has averaged 19% each year  and HiPay confirms in 2022 its established  continued growth model.Sharp decline in profitabilityThe direct cost rate2 deteriorated by 0.8% during the financial year  reflecting challenging market conditions in 2022  which was a transition year for the fintech sector.EBITDA was 1.3 million euros  which was positive for a third year in a row  and +2.8 million euros in 2021. Recurring operating income amounted to -3.2 million euros (-0.2 million euros over the second half of the year)  compared with -0.7 million euros a year earlier.In addition to the slight decline in gross margin  this drop in profitability is mainly due to the sharp rise in operating costs over the 2022 fiscal year  despite the strict cost-saving plan implemented in the fall of 2022 and taking effect throughout 2023. To this  can be added the non-recurring costs relating mainly to the reorganization and restructuring of the group (circa 3.1 million euros).Taking into account a non-current operating income of -2.9 million euros compared to -2.4 million euros in 2021 (reflecting the full provisioning of the company's risks)  a net financial charge of -1.2 million euros and a tax charge of 0.2 million euros  the net result is -7.8 million euros (vs. -4.3 million euros in 2021).Operating cash flow generationDuring the fiscal year  operating cash flow generation amounted to 2.1 million euros  with CAPEX amounting to 4.7 million euros and 2.4 million euros of net financial debts.As of December 31  2022  the company has 1.6 million euros in available cash.Additionally  there is a 2 million euro unused balance from the BJ Invest current account. Therefore  as of December 31  2022  HiPay has a cash mobilization capacity of 3.6 million euros. The continued support of BJ Invest  the main shareholder  allows HiPay to sustain its current and future operations.OutlookHiPay expects growth close to 10% in 2023 and is currently benefiting from a growing order book. At the same time  the group has implemented a significant cost-saving plan aimed at restoring positive cash flow generation as well as controlling its expenses and  consequently  systematically making its operations profitable.The development of HiPay's product offering coupled with the commercial dynamics of our merchant customers allows us to consider a return to systematic double-digit growth over the next five years.---------------1 Consolidated income at 31 December 2022 is currently being reviewed by external auditors.

We put in place the necessary operational resources and teams to accompany the full liberalisation of the driving school regulatory framework and the broad rollout of ""RDV Permis"". This platform has reshuffled the cards in our favour  enabling us to showcase our innovative approach  and providing opportunities to speed up our growth. Last February  we also reached a major milestone in our strategic plan with the Company IPO raising nearly €8 million to market our new offers in 2023 and expand our geographical coverage nationwide to fulfil our ambition of becoming the leading driving school in France"".Liberalisation of the driving school market - the ground-breaking “RDV Permis” platform : an outstanding opportunity.The broad rollout in 2022 by the public authorities of the ""RDV Permis"" website for registering for the practical driving examination has profoundly disrupted the way slots are allocated and thus enabling online driving school platforms to compete with traditional driving schools.With the number of slots for the driving test now based on the number of full-time equivalent instructors  the new system has reshuffled the cards by removing any advantages for traditional driving schools and allowing digital players to offer seats to candidates with significantly shorter waiting times.Drawing on a community of nearly 1 000 driving instructors  Lepermislibre seized this exceptional opportunity leading to a transformation of the driving school market and succeeded in reducing driving test waiting times from eight months before ""RDV Permis"" launch to an average of only 32 days at the end of 2022.The 2022 results incorporate substantial operational and HR investments needed for development.To adapt to these market changes  the Company underwent significant developments in 2022  as reflected in the results detailed below:In €k  audited dataFrench accounting standards 2022 2021 Chg. Revenue 14 877 12 238 +22% O/w non-CPF 4 660 3 388 +37% O/w CPF 10 215 8 850 +15% Other 2 - - Gross margin 5 731 4 039 +42% % of revenue 38.5% 33.0 % +5.5 pts Operating expenses 10 335 4 644 x2 2 O/w payroll expenses 4 031 1 972 x2 0 O/w marketing expenses 3 179 919 x3.5 Operating income/(loss) (4 605) (605) n/a Current income/(loss) before tax (4 655) (642) n/a Net income/(loss) (4 511) (632) n/aRevenue came to €14.9m  up 22% on 2021. The Company continued to support many candidates whose driver training is financed by their CPF personal training account credits (known as CPF). These candidates accounted for 69% of 2022 revenue  compared with 72% in 2021  and generated growth in sales of 15%. Applicants self-funding their driver training contributed to 31% of 2022 revenue compared with 28% in 2021  generating sales growth of 37%.Gross margin rose by more than 5 points compared with 2021  reaching 38.5% of revenue. It benefited from the mix of sales which still mainly comprised candidates using their CPF credits to finance their training. This is a peak level for the gross margin  as it is expected to gradually decrease to a threshold of around 30% in 2025 following the ongoing rebalancing work the Company has decided to carry out for the benefit of non-CPF candidates  which accounts for the majority of applicants.To anticipate a significant increase in the number of applicants accessing its offers  and to maintain the excellent quality of service that has made its platform so popular  during 2022 the Company accelerated the completion of its management (CFO  CMO  HRM) and operational (tech  IT  customer support) teams. At 31 December 2022  Lepermislibre had 82 employees compared with less than 50 at the end of 2021  an increase of 64% in its workforce.Up until 2021  the Company had focused its marketing efforts on a small number of media. During 2022  Lepermislibre stepped up its communication campaigns to strengthen its presence on social media and increase its brand awareness. During the second half of 2022 in particular it rolled out a broad print advertising campaign in several French cities. These substantial team and marketing investments led to a doubling of operating expenses compared with 2021  and an operating loss of €4.6 million in 2022 compared with a loss of €0.6 million in 2021.Acceleration of growth expected in 2023.Q1 2023 revenue  the details of which are provided below  amounted to €4.2 million  up 20% on Q1 2022.In €k  unaudited dataFrench accounting standards Q1 2023 Q1 2022 Chg. Revenue 4 167 3 467 +20 % O/w non-CPF 1 870 1 041 +80% O/w CPF Other 2 287 10 2 426 - -6% -As expected  the measures taken at the end of 2022 by the public authorities to strengthen the control and verification of digital identity has slowed down accessibility to training for new CPF candidates (-6% vs. Q1 2022). However  this has been offset by strong growth in the number of non-CPF applicants (+80% vs. Q1 2022)  who  with the reduction in times for presenting for the practical driving test  are increasingly turning to Lepermislibre for its quality and comprehensive driver training programme.The non-CPF applicant base has already grown strongly over the first three months of the year (45% of revenue vs. 30% in Q1 2022) and is set to continue growing mechanically each quarter  leading to an acceleration in revenue that the Company expects to be very visible from the second half of the year.This shift in the split of candidates also benefits the Company’s working capital as non-CPF candidates are paying their driving lessons cash as opposed to non-CPF candidates whose driving lessons are paid at the end of their training cycle despite a small advance payment being paid upfrontIn order to best support its users  Lepermislibre launched during the first quarter a new service to simplify the mandatory and binding administrative procedures required when registering for the driving test. Applicants can now rely on Lepermislibre’s expertise and digitised process to easily obtain their registration number. This simplified approach is fully in line with the changes in the regulatory framework introduced under the recent Houlié law  which was adopted by the National Assembly on the 27th of March with the aim of facilitating the process of obtaining a driving licence.In the coming months  the Company is expected to take full advantage of these sector developments and the execution of its roadmap to speed up its growth.Next press release13 July 2023: H1 2023 revenueCONTACTSLEPERMISLIBRE Lucas Tournel  co-founder and CEO Fabrice Kilfiger  CFO invest@lepermislibre.fr ACTIFIN  Investor RelationsFoucauld Charavay+33 (0) 9 70 68 28 93lepermislibre@actifin.fr ACTIFIN  Financial PressIsabelle Dray+33 (0)1 56 88 11 29idray@actifin.fr Corporate press Delphine Margot +33 (0)6 63 52 66 20 madelgofine@gmail.comABOUT LEPERMISLIBREFounded in 2014  Lepermislibre is a pioneer in the online driving school space in France  having reinvented online driver training with an offer that departs radically from that of traditional players and one that is more in line with the new uses and lifestyles of the digital native generation that has grown up at the same time as digital technology has developed.Lepermislibre brings together a community of 1 000 loyal  committed  and passionate instructors  all of whom are state qualified.Its digital  more agile and fully transparent model  which is 30% less expensive than the traditional driving school  has attracted nearly 466 000 candidates.With reviews averaging nearly 5 stars on Trustpilot  the platform offers a personal space with improved methods for learning and revising the rules of the road and flexibility around scheduling.

The consolidated financial statements have been audited in full. The auditors' report will be published once the due diligence procedures required for the publication of the annual financial report have been completed.Consolidated data (in € million) FYI 2021 FYI 2022 Change IFRS 2022 vs 2021 Revenue 78.8 90.6 +15% Gross profit 49.0 54.4 +11% Gross margin (%) 62% 60% Operating profit 1.1 -0.2 Operating margin (%) 1.4% -0.2% Financial profit / loss 0.5 -0.2 Tax income 0.2 0.3 Group net profit 1.8 -0.1 Net margin (%) 2.3% -0.1%Market share gainsTotal Revenues amounted €90.6 million[2] for the fiscal year ending 31 December 2022.The Second Half gross margin (62%) represented an improvement on the First Half (58%)  to stand at 60% on a full year basis  compared with 62% in 2021 and 55% in 2020.The gross profit stood at €54.4 million  up 11%.Monthly Recurring Revenues (MRR) increased by 25% from €1.96 million in January 2022 to €2.44 million in January 2023  ahead of expectations. This growth clearly exceeded topline growth  reflecting the efficiency of our transformation strategy.Ongoing investment in growth in 2022Ateme continued to invest in supporting its growth in 2022. Operating costs rose by 14% to €54.6 million notably with an increase in total headcount from 490 to 560 over the year. These additional investments were mostly directed at the R&D effort  up €4.8 million or 30% year-on-year and G&A  up €1.2 million or 24% year-on-year  while Sales and Marketing costs were virtually stable (+3%).Operating profit stood at €-0.2 million  while net profit was virtually at zero  integrating a negative financial result and positive tax income.EBITDA stood at €5.0 million  versus €6.4 million in 2021  reflecting continued investment in R&D maintained throughout 2022  and the timing of revenue recognition related to certain projects which shifted into 2023.Shareholders' equity stood at €40.9 million at 31 December 2022 up from €39.6 million a year earlier.Liquidity stood at €3.9 million vs €11.4 million a year earlier  due to the increase in working capital including a particularly strong increase in inventory (+€3.4 million) to address the stresses in the semiconductor industry in 2022 and meet the expected growth. In 2023 inventories are set to decrease  while the company is taking additional actions to reduce its customer accounts receivable  particularly high at the end of 2022.At 31 December 2022  net debt amounted to €20.1 million vs €10.3 million (excluding IFRS 16). This includes €8 million of Research Tax Credit receivable mobilized.Looking aheadThe global supply-chain context has been improving in the last months paving the way for a positive impact on the shipment and revenue recognition cycle  as well as a reduction in inventory and cash mobilization.Business at the beginning of 2023 is rather well oriented  especially in North America thanks to a shift in some closings from 2022 to 2023. The year should also see further benefits from the synergies resulting from the acquisition of Anevia  with a significant ramp up in NEA sales. Furthermore  the growth of operational investments will slow down after the important efforts made in 2022.All financial objectives are therefore confirmed  notably:revenue growth of 10-15% in 2023;EBITDA of €5-10 million in 2023  above €10 million in 2024  and €30 million in 2026;ongoing development of Monthly Recurring Revenues  with an objective of €3 million in 2024 and €4 million in 2026.Leading the way in technologyAteme continues to distinguish itself through the delivery of technological innovation  strengthening its position in the ecosystem.

Leaving the FTSE will be a blow for post-Brexit Britain  with CRH one of the largest companies in the index.It is a huge blow for the Euronext Dublin exchange  and means CRH’s shares will no longer be traded within the EU.CRH’s earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortisation (Ebitda) were $5.6bn (€5.3bn) last year  up 13pc on 2021. Its Ebitda margin was up 10 basis points to 17.2pc  despite cost increases.Group sales rose 12pc across the year to $32.7bn.Profit after tax rose 10pc to $2.7bn  with CRH announcing higher dividends and a new $3bn share buyback.,neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,mixed,0.16,0.06,0.79,True,English,"['Irish stock exchange', 'US move', 'CRH', 'chief executive Albert Manifold', 'new $3bn share buyback', 'finance chief Jim Mintern', 'US equity index inclusion', 'Building materials giant CRH', 'booming US demand', 'The Irish Times', 'annual general meeting', 'President Joe Biden', 'sweeping infrastructure subsidies', 'The Irish company', '500 best performing companies', 'Dublin stock exchange', 'Euronext Dublin exchange', 'New York', 'FTSE100 index', 'Mr Mintern', 'US move', 'top-performing companies', 'Euronext listing', 'largest companies', 'main listing', 'second listing', 'secondary listing', 'S&P500', 'biggest prize', 'consistent advice', 'record 2022 sales', 'cash reserves', 'business sense', 'American sales', 'primary listing', 'post-Brexit Britain', 'cost increases', 'higher dividends', 'huge blow', 'Ebitda margin', 'Group sales', 'firm', 'London', 'Ireland', 'aim', 'achievement', 'statement', 'clear', 'advisors', 'goal', 'decision', 'April', 'shareholders', 'profits', 'margins', '75pc', 'earnings', 'shares', 'interest', 'taxes', 'depreciation', 'amortisation', '2pc', 'year']",2023-04-07,2023-04-07,independent.ie

The company has indicated an intention to retain its secondary listing in the Republic. File photograph: Cyril ByrneCRH  the largest company on the Irish stock market  is planning to quit the Dublin exchange as it seeks to ensure that it will be eligible for inclusion on the influential S&P 500 Wall Street index.The move will come as a massive blow to Irish stockbrokers and Euronext Dublin  the operator of the Irish market  who had been hoping CRH would retain its secondary listing in the Republic even as it advanced a plan to move its primary stock quotation from London to New York.The building materials giant will remain headquartered and tax resident in Ireland. However  it is believed its advisers think it would be easier for the S&P 500 committee to include the company on the benchmark index if it were not also listed in Dublin  where most of the trading volume in the stock takes place.Irish HQ“The achievement of US equity index inclusion is critical to this move. We have received clear and consistent advice from our advisers that to be successful in achieving US equity index inclusion  CRH will need to delist from Euronext Dublin ” said Jim Mintern  CRH’s chief financial officer  in response to questions from The Irish Times.READ MORE“Notwithstanding this  CRH will remain incorporated  headquartered and tax resident in Ireland. We will also maintain a standard listing on the London Stock Exchange. While we would have preferred to maintain our Euronext listing  it is clear that this would not be compatible with our goal of achieving a US equity index inclusion.”While Mr Mintern did not say what index CRH is targeting  market sources said that the S&P 500 is the obvious aim. The company will be forced to leave the FTSE 100  however  as it moves from a primary to standard listing in London.If CRH  with a €31.8 billion market value that accounts for almost 22 per cent of the capitalisation of the Iseq 20 index  were to become a member of the S&P 500  it would force investors that track the widely followed US index to buy shares in the company.The hope is that the group would also trade at a premium relative to profits by being listed in the US  where companies are traditionally valued on higher earnings multiples compared to Europe.However  CRH’s departure would be a seminal moment for the Irish market  where it routinely is the most traded stock by value. CRH was formed in 1970 through the merger of the already publicly quoted Irish Cement (which floated in 1936) and Roadstone companies.Corporation tax boost/Have we reached peak house prices? Listen | 47:18Mainstream stockbrokers  who make average commissions of 0.08-0.12 percentage points (8-12 basis points) of the value of trades in CRH  have ceded much of the trading activity in recent years in the large-cap company to so-called algorithmic trading platforms  where charges are at low single-digit basis points  according to market sources.As CRH will continue to be domiciled in the Republic  ordinary Irish shareholders will continue to face Irish dividends withholding tax  levied at a rate of 25 per cent. A 1 per cent stamp duty on share trading in Irish companies would also continue to apply for directly held CRH stock.A spokeswoman for Euronext said it “would be disappointed to see any company leave our markets”  but declined to comment on CRH.“A core focus for us remains working closely with the broader equity markets ecosystem to deliver a more favourable market environment to support the growth and funding of Irish companies and incentivise more companies to IPO in the future ” she added.Marked progressMr Mintern said CRH was continuing to engage with shareholders regarding its recommendation  announced a month ago  to establish a primary stock exchange listing in the US.“The engagement is progressing well to date  with broad support being expressed by shareholders. We will formally update the market as part of our trading statement on April 26th in advance of our agm ” he said  referring to the company’s annual general meeting.Flutter Entertainment is also looking at taking on a US stock market listing  fuelling speculation that it may follow CRH in moving its primary quotation to New York.Meanwhile  a triple whammy over the past two decades of Irish pension funds being pressed to lower their exposure to Irish equities  foreign takeovers of the main local investment players  and a shift by the industry from active stock-picking to passive investment  has conspired to make initial public offerings less attractive.Only three companies — Uniphar  Corre Energy  and HealthBeacon — have floated in Dublin in the past four years.,neutral,0.04,0.91,0.05,mixed,0.44,0.13,0.43,True,English,"['Dublin exchange', 'New York', 'S&P 500', 'CRH', 'influential S&P 500 Wall Street index', 'CRH chief executive Albert Manifold', 'low single-digit basis points', 'main local investment players', 'broader equity markets ecosystem', 'US equity index inclusion', '1 per cent stamp duty', 'primary stock exchange listing', 'US stock market listing', 'chief financial officer', 'S&P 500 committee', '0.08-0.12 percentage points', 'building materials giant', 'higher earnings multiples', 'peak house prices', 'annual general meeting', 'past two decades', 'initial public offerings', 'past four years', 'favourable market environment', 'The Irish Times', 'Irish pension funds', 'algorithmic trading platforms', 'primary stock quotation', 'Corporation tax boost', 'Irish stock market', 'London Stock Exchange', '€31.8 billion market value', 'ordinary Irish shareholders', 'US index', '22 per cent', '25 per cent', 'benchmark index', 'Iseq 20 index', 'primary quotation', 'passive investment', 'Irish market', 'primary to', 'index CRH', 'Dublin exchange', 'secondary listing', 'standard listing', 'recent years', 'market sources', 'Euronext listing', 'Irish stockbrokers', 'Irish HQ', 'Irish Cement', 'Irish dividends', 'Irish equities', 'trading volume', 'trading activity', 'share trading', 'trading statement', 'File photograph', 'Cyril Byrne', 'massive blow', 'New York', 'consistent advice', 'Jim Mintern', 'Mr Mintern', 'obvious aim', 'seminal moment', 'Mainstream stockbrokers', 'average commissions', 'CRH stock', 'core focus', 'broad support', 'Flutter Entertainment', 'triple whammy', 'foreign takeovers', 'active stock-picking', 'Corre Energy', 'Irish companies', 'Roadstone companies', 'three companies', 'Euronext Dublin', 'largest company', 'large-cap company', 'CRH.', 'intention', 'Republic', 'move', 'operator', 'plan', 'Ireland', 'advisers', 'place', 'achievement', 'clear', 'response', 'questions', 'READ', 'goal', 'FTSE', 'capitalisation', 'member', 'investors', 'shares', 'hope', 'group', 'premium', 'profits', 'Europe', 'departure', 'merger', 'Listen', 'trades', 'charges', 'rate', 'spokeswoman', 'growth', 'funding', 'IPO', 'future', 'progress', 'recommendation', 'engagement', 'date', 'April', 'advance', 'agm', 'speculation', 'exposure', 'shift', 'industry', 'Uniphar', 'HealthBeacon']",2023-04-07,2023-04-07,irishtimes.com
