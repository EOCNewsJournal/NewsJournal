Leaving the FTSE will be a blow for post-Brexit Britain  with CRH one of the largest companies in the index.It is a huge blow for the Euronext Dublin exchange  and means CRH’s shares will no longer be traded within the EU.CRH’s earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortisation (Ebitda) were $5.6bn (€5.3bn) last year  up 13pc on 2021. Its Ebitda margin was up 10 basis points to 17.2pc  despite cost increases.Group sales rose 12pc across the year to $32.7bn.Profit after tax rose 10pc to $2.7bn  with CRH announcing higher dividends and a new $3bn share buyback.,neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,mixed,0.16,0.06,0.79,True,English,"['Irish stock exchange', 'US move', 'CRH', 'chief executive Albert Manifold', 'new $3bn share buyback', 'finance chief Jim Mintern', 'US equity index inclusion', 'Building materials giant CRH', 'booming US demand', 'The Irish Times', 'annual general meeting', 'President Joe Biden', 'sweeping infrastructure subsidies', 'The Irish company', '500 best performing companies', 'Dublin stock exchange', 'Euronext Dublin exchange', 'New York', 'FTSE100 index', 'Mr Mintern', 'US move', 'top-performing companies', 'Euronext listing', 'largest companies', 'main listing', 'second listing', 'secondary listing', 'S&P500', 'biggest prize', 'consistent advice', 'record 2022 sales', 'cash reserves', 'business sense', 'American sales', 'primary listing', 'post-Brexit Britain', 'cost increases', 'higher dividends', 'huge blow', 'Ebitda margin', 'Group sales', 'firm', 'London', 'Ireland', 'aim', 'achievement', 'statement', 'clear', 'advisors', 'goal', 'decision', 'April', 'shareholders', 'profits', 'margins', '75pc', 'earnings', 'shares', 'interest', 'taxes', 'depreciation', 'amortisation', '2pc', 'year']",2023-04-07,2023-04-08,independent.ie

The company has indicated an intention to retain its secondary listing in the Republic. File photograph: Cyril ByrneCRH  the largest company on the Irish stock market  is planning to quit the Dublin exchange as it seeks to ensure that it will be eligible for inclusion on the influential S&P 500 Wall Street index.The move will come as a massive blow to Irish stockbrokers and Euronext Dublin  the operator of the Irish market  who had been hoping CRH would retain its secondary listing in the Republic even as it advanced a plan to move its primary stock quotation from London to New York.The building materials giant will remain headquartered and tax resident in Ireland. However  it is believed its advisers think it would be easier for the S&P 500 committee to include the company on the benchmark index if it were not also listed in Dublin  where most of the trading volume in the stock takes place.Irish HQ“The achievement of US equity index inclusion is critical to this move. We have received clear and consistent advice from our advisers that to be successful in achieving US equity index inclusion  CRH will need to delist from Euronext Dublin ” said Jim Mintern  CRH’s chief financial officer  in response to questions from The Irish Times.READ MORE“Notwithstanding this  CRH will remain incorporated  headquartered and tax resident in Ireland. We will also maintain a standard listing on the London Stock Exchange. While we would have preferred to maintain our Euronext listing  it is clear that this would not be compatible with our goal of achieving a US equity index inclusion.”While Mr Mintern did not say what index CRH is targeting  market sources said that the S&P 500 is the obvious aim. The company will be forced to leave the FTSE 100  however  as it moves from a primary to standard listing in London.If CRH  with a €31.8 billion market value that accounts for almost 22 per cent of the capitalisation of the Iseq 20 index  were to become a member of the S&P 500  it would force investors that track the widely followed US index to buy shares in the company.The hope is that the group would also trade at a premium relative to profits by being listed in the US  where companies are traditionally valued on higher earnings multiples compared to Europe.However  CRH’s departure would be a seminal moment for the Irish market  where it routinely is the most traded stock by value. CRH was formed in 1970 through the merger of the already publicly quoted Irish Cement (which floated in 1936) and Roadstone companies.Corporation tax boost/Have we reached peak house prices? Listen | 47:18Mainstream stockbrokers  who make average commissions of 0.08-0.12 percentage points (8-12 basis points) of the value of trades in CRH  have ceded much of the trading activity in recent years in the large-cap company to so-called algorithmic trading platforms  where charges are at low single-digit basis points  according to market sources.As CRH will continue to be domiciled in the Republic  ordinary Irish shareholders will continue to face Irish dividends withholding tax  levied at a rate of 25 per cent. A 1 per cent stamp duty on share trading in Irish companies would also continue to apply for directly held CRH stock.A spokeswoman for Euronext said it “would be disappointed to see any company leave our markets”  but declined to comment on CRH.“A core focus for us remains working closely with the broader equity markets ecosystem to deliver a more favourable market environment to support the growth and funding of Irish companies and incentivise more companies to IPO in the future ” she added.Marked progressMr Mintern said CRH was continuing to engage with shareholders regarding its recommendation  announced a month ago  to establish a primary stock exchange listing in the US.“The engagement is progressing well to date  with broad support being expressed by shareholders. We will formally update the market as part of our trading statement on April 26th in advance of our agm ” he said  referring to the company’s annual general meeting.Flutter Entertainment is also looking at taking on a US stock market listing  fuelling speculation that it may follow CRH in moving its primary quotation to New York.Meanwhile  a triple whammy over the past two decades of Irish pension funds being pressed to lower their exposure to Irish equities  foreign takeovers of the main local investment players  and a shift by the industry from active stock-picking to passive investment  has conspired to make initial public offerings less attractive.Only three companies — Uniphar  Corre Energy  and HealthBeacon — have floated in Dublin in the past four years.,neutral,0.04,0.91,0.05,mixed,0.44,0.13,0.43,True,English,"['Dublin exchange', 'New York', 'S&P 500', 'CRH', 'influential S&P 500 Wall Street index', 'CRH chief executive Albert Manifold', 'low single-digit basis points', 'main local investment players', 'broader equity markets ecosystem', 'US equity index inclusion', '1 per cent stamp duty', 'primary stock exchange listing', 'US stock market listing', 'chief financial officer', 'S&P 500 committee', '0.08-0.12 percentage points', 'building materials giant', 'higher earnings multiples', 'peak house prices', 'annual general meeting', 'past two decades', 'initial public offerings', 'past four years', 'favourable market environment', 'The Irish Times', 'Irish pension funds', 'algorithmic trading platforms', 'primary stock quotation', 'Corporation tax boost', 'Irish stock market', 'London Stock Exchange', '€31.8 billion market value', 'ordinary Irish shareholders', 'US index', '22 per cent', '25 per cent', 'benchmark index', 'Iseq 20 index', 'primary quotation', 'passive investment', 'Irish market', 'primary to', 'index CRH', 'Dublin exchange', 'secondary listing', 'standard listing', 'recent years', 'market sources', 'Euronext listing', 'Irish stockbrokers', 'Irish HQ', 'Irish Cement', 'Irish dividends', 'Irish equities', 'trading volume', 'trading activity', 'share trading', 'trading statement', 'File photograph', 'Cyril Byrne', 'massive blow', 'New York', 'consistent advice', 'Jim Mintern', 'Mr Mintern', 'obvious aim', 'seminal moment', 'Mainstream stockbrokers', 'average commissions', 'CRH stock', 'core focus', 'broad support', 'Flutter Entertainment', 'triple whammy', 'foreign takeovers', 'active stock-picking', 'Corre Energy', 'Irish companies', 'Roadstone companies', 'three companies', 'Euronext Dublin', 'largest company', 'large-cap company', 'CRH.', 'intention', 'Republic', 'move', 'operator', 'plan', 'Ireland', 'advisers', 'place', 'achievement', 'clear', 'response', 'questions', 'READ', 'goal', 'FTSE', 'capitalisation', 'member', 'investors', 'shares', 'hope', 'group', 'premium', 'profits', 'Europe', 'departure', 'merger', 'Listen', 'trades', 'charges', 'rate', 'spokeswoman', 'growth', 'funding', 'IPO', 'future', 'progress', 'recommendation', 'engagement', 'date', 'April', 'advance', 'agm', 'speculation', 'exposure', 'shift', 'industry', 'Uniphar', 'HealthBeacon']",2023-04-07,2023-04-08,irishtimes.com

In this context Soitec anticipates for the whole of FY’24 revenue to be stable at constant exchange rates and perimeter as compared to FY’23 and EBITDA1 margin2 to remain around 36%.The stability of the revenue will be reflecting different dynamics across Soitec’s three end markets with strong demand anticipated for both Automotive & Industrial and Smart Devices while a weaker smartphone market with a strong inventory correction  especially during the first half of FY’24  is expected to weigh on Mobile communications.The stability of FY’24 revenue will therefore also reflect a strong acceleration from H1 to H2  with H1’24 revenue expected to decline by around -15% year-on-year at constant exchange rates and perimeter.FY’26 financial modelSoitec is anticipating significant growth in each of its three end markets and new products and is managing its business to reach in FY’26:a targeted revenue of around $2.1 billion  as compared to a revenue of $2.3 billion communicated in June 2022  an EBITDA 1 margin 2 target of around 40% (at a 1.10 Euro/ US Dollar exchange rate).These targets are sustained by Soitec’s strong portfolio with both further growth in existing products (FD-SOI  RF-SOI  Power-SOI and Photonics-SOI) and new products (especially SiC  POI and GaN) coming in the three end markets: Mobile communications  Automotive & Industrial and Smart devices.

Five years into our listing on the Euronext Paris stock exchange  we continue to develop our portfolio with the same passion. At the end of 2022  our total capacity stood at 6.6 GW in operation or under construction- a six-fold increase in six years. This achievement makes us more confident than ever in our ability to meet our target of 10 GW in operation or under construction by 2025.Our pure-player strategy centres on a comprehensive mix of three key renewable technologies - solar  wind and storage. Thanks to our expertise  we were awarded over 1 300 MW of new projects across our various technologies and regions (Australia  Europe  and the Americas) in 2022. Responding to client expectations on carbon footprint reduction and competitiveness  we have signed several Corporate PPAs this year : our tenth in the Nordics  our first in France  and even more importantly a baseload PPA in Australia - demonstrating our growing strength when it comes to integrating our production assets. We have also consolidated our leadership in the storage sector  with Western Downs Battery in Queensland and Blyth Battery in South Australia  which will take their place among the world's largest batteries.On the topic of storage  our capacity for innovation has allowed us to broaden our range of services  with a virtual battery and the world's first grid-scale inertia service in Australia  and support services for the commissioning of Finland's Olkiluoto 3 nuclear reactor. These achievements complement the critical role played by our big batteries in driving the energy transition by creating new sources of value from our assets.In 2022  Neoen strengthened its presence in each of our regions  ensuring our people are as close as possible to our projects and taking our team to a total of over 360 employees. Our local presence is the driving force of Neoen's growth and our values of audacity  integrity  commitment and esprit de corps are brought to life on a daily basis through the actions of each member of our team.,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,positive,0.56,0.44,0.01,True,English,"['Universal registration document', 'NEOEN', '07', 'Euronext Paris stock exchange', 'first grid-scale inertia service', 'three key renewable technologies', 'carbon footprint reduction', 'several Corporate PPAs', 'Olkiluoto 3 nuclear reactor', 'esprit de corps', 'Western Downs Battery', 'various technologies', 'Blyth Battery', 'virtual battery', 'long-term view', 'same passion', 'six-fold increase', 'six years', 'pure-player strategy', 'comprehensive mix', 'client expectations', 'baseload PPA', 'growing strength', 'largest batteries', 'critical role', 'big batteries', 'energy transition', 'new sources', 'driving force', 'daily basis', 'production assets', 'support services', 'local presence', 'new projects', 'storage sector', 'South Australia', 'total capacity', 'inception', 'development', 'growth', 'value', 'listing', 'portfolio', 'end', '6.6 GW', 'operation', 'construction', 'achievement', 'ability', 'target', '10 GW', 'wind', 'expertise', '1,300 MW', 'regions', 'Europe', 'Americas', 'competitiveness', 'tenth', 'Nordics', 'France', 'leadership', 'Queensland', 'place', 'world', 'topic', 'innovation', 'range', 'commissioning', 'Finland', 'Neoen', 'people', 'team', '360 employees', 'audacity', 'integrity', 'commitment', 'life', 'actions', 'member', '2022']",2023-04-07,2023-04-08,marketscreener.com

It was attended by the heads of state of China and France  representatives from both Chinese and French governments and entrepreneurs. The Meeting focused on discussions around various topics  including trade  investment  technology  and tourism.Accor x Jin Jiang MOUDuring the Meeting  Shanghai Jin Jiang International Hotels and Accor signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with a term ending in 2033. This MOU represents a strategic partnership between the two parties  with the primary ambition being to promote and drive sustainable transformations across the hospitality industry and reduce the sector's carbon emissions. Both groups have expressed their intention to peak carbon emissions by 2030 and strive to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. Together  the parties are aiming to create and define an ESG measurement framework tailored specifically to the hotel sector  establishing a benchmark and set of targets shaped to the unique nuances of the hotel industry. They will also work jointly to pioneer new industry standards relating to sustainable guest rooms and reducing food waste and will also explore opportunities in sustainable finance and launch a global training initiative.This strategic partnership highlights the joint determination of Jin Jiang Hotels and Accor to pioneer new ESG standards in the hotel industry and contribute to broader environmental  social  and governance efforts in reducing carbon emissions in China.In developing sustainable guest rooms  Jin Jiang Hotels and Accor hope to explore the creation of sustainable rooms that reduce carbon emissions from construction and operations without compromising guest experience  aiming to reduce utility costs such as water and electricity by 10% across both groups by 2030. In terms of reducing food waste  both parties hope to create a standardized process utilizing universal technology to minimize food waste generated in every stage from procurement to guest services and catering services  until the end of the guest's stay  ultimately working towards a common goal of reducing food waste by 30% by 2030. It is their firm belief that pioneering new ESG standards in the hotel industry will also play an important role in contributing to China's broader efforts in reducing carbon emissions and make a significant contribution towards the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals.At the same time  both parties will launch the School for Change training program for all headquarters and hotel levels. School for Change was initially launched at all Accor headquarters to increase employee awareness of sustainable development challenges and  under this collaboration  employees and talents in hotels of both partners will be able to access a content platform and training path focused on the basics of climate change  enhancing their individual understanding of its causes and impact on biodiversity and communities  thus promoting the sharing of solutions and creating positive change at all levels.The MOU will also evaluate and explore potential business cooperation opportunities in sustainable finance  with the parties hoping to develop the possibility of using sustainable finance as a transformative tool. This initiative will involve using loans and green financing to help establish a direct connection between the financial terms of their credits and predetermined sustainability goals and standards.As influential  leading hotel groups  Jin Jiang Hotels and Accor hope to send a clear call for action to the broader hospitality industry via this MOU  advocating for responsible business practices in the hotel sector and encouraging collaboration through motivating leadership and industry stakeholders to contribute to one common ambition of reducing carbon emissions. The companies also view the MOU as an opportunity to actively explore more business cooperation possibilities together  providing more practical examples for China-France enterprise collaboration.Gary Rosen  CEO  Accor Greater China  said: ""We are proud to enter this strategic partnership with Jin Jiang Hotels  a leading global hospitality company. Jin Jiang Hotels plays a key role in China and we are confident that  together  we will be able to deliver critical practices that alleviate the burden on the planet without compromising the magic of the guest experience. Accor is committed to constant innovation and being a net contributor within the communities we exist. Climate action lies at the core of our hospitality vision and business model  and we are excited about the possibilities this partnership will deliver"".Shirley Shen  CEO  Jin Jiang Hotels  added: ""The hospitality industry stands as one of the most vibrant and far-reaching economic sectors across the globe  and this is especially true in China  where it holds the potential to make a significant impact on the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). As leading hotel groups in the industry  both Jin Jiang Hotels and Accor are committed to sending a clear and powerful message to the wider sector. We call upon our peers to champion responsible business practices within the hospitality industry  and we are determined to inspire leadership and engage industry stakeholders in collaborative efforts. Together  we will drive our sector's contribution to sustainable development goals  with a particular focus on reducing carbon emissions as part of the ESG targets.""Notes to editorsThe China-France Entrepreneurs Committee is a platform for exchange and cooperation between Chinese and French enterprises  jointly promoted by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce and the French Ministry of Economy and Finance.

This SaaS version is included in the WALLIX PAM4OT package.To carry out their activities  organizations - in all sectors and especially in industry - rely on external service providers who  in order to fulfill their mission  need to connect to their IT infrastructure (traditional or industrial).SaaS Remote Access is aimed at all organizations wishing to provide digital access to their IT infrastructure to external service providers  thanks to simplified management while benefiting from the highest level of cybersecurity offered by a PAM leader recognized by Gartner.PARIS  April 4  2023 /PRNewswire/ -- WALLIX  (Euronext: ALLIX) a European cybersecurity software publisher expert in Access and Identity Solutions  launches SaaS Remote Access  the SaaS version of the remote access management technology integrated into WALLIX PAM4ALL  its unified privilege management solution. SaaS Remote Access is designed for organizations - across all sectors and in particular the industrial one - that want to provide digital access to their IT infrastructure to external providers through simplified management  while benefiting from the highest level of cybersecurity offered by a PAM leader recognized by Gartner.To carry out their business  organizations rely on external service providers who need to connect to their IT infrastructure (whether traditional or industrial). These can be remote maintainers  supply chain vendors  service providers  external consultants  etc.The problem for organizations is that these external stakeholders are numerous and can change constantly. In addition  the frequency and duration of their intervention vary according to the needs of the business and their requirements. This is why visualizing  managing  and securing their access becomes a real headache for IT teams. It is indeed vital for organizations to know who has access to what  from where  and why  as well as to manage access permissions. This is the only way to detect and stop any attempt at identity theft by a hacker  internal malice  or negligence  and thus protect data. The fact is that the cost of a cyberattack increases by an average of $370 000 if a third party is involved. Moreover  by implementing traceability through a security and digital access management solution  organizations also ensure regulatory compliance with current cybersecurity standards.Traditionally  in an attempt to manage external stakeholder access  the IT team will implement VPN technology  a secure ""tunnel"" between the external stakeholder's device and the organization's IT infrastructure. Except that  in reality  VPN vulnerabilities regularly make news headlines. On the other hand  implementing VPNs is a cumbersome and expensive process: each stakeholder must be referenced in Active Directory  the Microsoft software used by almost all organizations  which allows permissions to be managed and access to IT resources (data  servers  applications  software  etc.) to be controlled. And this technology does not meet the regulatory requirements either.The Answer: SaaS Remote AccessTo optimize the management of external service provider access  IT teams should turn to innovative solutions such as SaaS Remote Access.WALLIX PAM4ALL is a unified privilege management solution. It combines all WALLIX technologies: multi-factor authentication (MFA)  remote access management  session management  password management  and least privilege management. The solution secures all access to the IT infrastructure  ensuring data protection  detection  and resistance to cyberattacks and business continuity. It also ensures compliance with cybersecurity regulations.SaaS Remote Access is WALLIX PAM4ALL's ""remote access management"" technology now available as a service. It has been developed especially for the access management of external providers.This SaaS version of the WALLIX remote access management technology is also available in WALLIX PAM4OT  a packaged offer based on WALLIX PAM4ALL  dedicated to industrial companies and those that own industrial equipment (like hospitals with scanners  etc.).The advantages of subscribing to this functionality in SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) mode are:Ease of Deployment and UseThanks to SaaS mode  there is no need to install a new solution to replace VPNs; an Internet connection is all that is needed to access SaaS Remote Access. This allows better accessibility  flexibility  and cost reduction. In addition  thanks to its user-friendly interface  it is quick and easy for companies to register their external service providers and configure their access rights to authorized resources. This frees the IT team from these actions and allows them to focus on more value-added tasks.End-to-end SecurityThe digital identities and passwords of external stakeholders are no longer integrated into the organization's Active Directory but are managed and secured in SaaS Remote Access. This drastically reduces cyber risk  since the more digital identities in the Active Directory  the greater the chance of a hacker stealing them and then accessing all the resources of the person whose identity has been stolen. This also allows the organization to have an IT hygiene that follows cybersecurity and traceability standards  enabling cybersecurity by design.Full Visibility of External Remote AccessWith SaaS Remote Access  organizations regain control of external remote access. Companies create access for their external providers in real time for a defined period and are automatically removed once the task is completed. External providers connect to the organization's IT infrastructure through the SaaS Remote Access web portal and every action they take is monitored  providing full visibility and transparency.""With this remote access management for suppliers  we are both meeting the security challenges of IT teams and promoting the digital transformation of companies. We also give autonomy to business teams and put the digital experience at the heart of our solution: speed of access creation  fluidity of interactions with suppliers  and operational efficiency for all business and IT teams. Interacting with suppliers and maintaining a line of defense for digital access becomes extremely easy and cost-effective with our solution. The launch of this service for securing external access to IT and industrial infrastructures is only the first phase of WALLIX's SaaS strategy "" explains Edwige Brossard  Product & Marketing Director at WALLIX.www.wallix.com | info@wallix.comLogo - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1801456/3815089/Wallix_Logo.jpgView original content:https://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/wallix-launches-saas-remote-access-to-facilitate-digital-access-for-external-providers-in-an-agile-and-secure-way-301775171.html",neutral,0.24,0.76,0.0,mixed,0.24,0.07,0.69,True,English,"['SaaS Remote Access', 'digital access', 'external providers', 'secure way', 'WALLIX', 'agile', 'WALLIX remote access management technology', 'unified privilege management solution', 'European cybersecurity software publisher', 'remote access management"" technology', 'WALLIX PAM4ALL unified solution', 'external service provider access', 'digital access management solution', 'supply chain vendors', 'SaaS Remote Access', 'current cybersecurity standards', 'WALLIX PAM4OT package', 'external service providers', 'external stakeholder access', 'VPN technology', 'remote maintainers', 'new solution', 'external providers', 'simplified management', 'session management', 'password management', 'access rights', 'external consultants', 'external stakeholders', 'SaaS version', 'digital identities', 'WALLIX technologies', 'Microsoft software', 'access permissions', 'cybersecurity regulations', 'SaaS mode', 'IT infrastructure', 'highest level', 'PAM leader', 'Identity Solutions', 'real headache', 'IT teams', 'identity theft', 'internal malice', 'third party', 'secure ""tunnel', 'VPN vulnerabilities', 'news headlines', 'other hand', 'expensive process', 'Active Directory', 'IT resources', 'The Answer', 'innovative solutions', 'multi-factor authentication', 'Internet connection', 'user-friendly interface', 'authorized resources', 'value-added tasks', 'industrial one', 'industrial equipment', 'regulatory compliance', 'regulatory requirements', 'cost reduction', 'end Security', 'data protection', 'business continuity', 'industrial companies', 'activities', 'organizations', 'sectors', 'industry', 'order', 'Gartner', 'PARIS', 'April', 'PRNewswire', 'Euronext', 'expert', 'problem', 'addition', 'frequency', 'duration', 'intervention', 'needs', 'way', 'attempt', 'hacker', 'negligence', 'cyberattack', 'average', 'traceability', 'device', 'reality', 'VPNs', 'cumbersome', 'servers', 'applications', 'MFA', 'least', 'detection', 'resistance', 'offer', 'hospitals', 'scanners', 'advantages', 'functionality', 'Ease', 'Deployment', 'accessibility', 'flexibility', 'actions', 'passwords']",2023-04-08,2023-04-08,news.webindia123.com
