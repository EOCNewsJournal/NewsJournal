Resolution regarding allocation of the Company‚Äôs result according to the adopted balance sheetThe board of directors proposes that no dividend is distributed for the financial year 2022.Item 11. Resolution regarding authorization for the board of directors to decide on new issue and issue of warrants and/or convertiblesThe board of directors proposes that the AGM resolves to authorize the board of directors to resolve  for the period until the end of the next annual general meeting  at one or more occasions and with or without deviation from the shareholders‚Äô preferential rights  to issue new shares  warrants and/or convertible debentures for cash payment and/or with provision of non-cash consideration or set-off or otherwise.In the event of a resolution to issue new shares  warrants and/or convertible debentures  without deviation from the shareholders‚Äô preferential rights the maximum number of shares  or warrants or convertible debentures that entitle subscription of a number of shares  that may be issued shall correspond to the number of shares that is within the Company's maximum limit for the number of shares according to the articles of association in force from time to time. In the event of a resolution with deviation from the shareholders‚Äô preferential rights  the number of shares  or warrants or convertible debentures that entitle subscription of a number of shares  that may be issued shall not exceed 20 per cent of the Company‚Äôs registered number of shares at the time of the board of director‚Äôs first resolution pursuant to the authorization. For subsequent resolutions pursuant to the authorization  the 20 per cent limit shall be based on (i) the number of shares issued pursuant to the authorization  and  with respect to warrants and convertible debentures issued pursuant to the authorization  (ii) the number of shares issued through subscription of issued warrants  and (iii) the number of shares issued through conversion of issued convertible debentures  provided that subscription/conversion of such warrants/convertible debentures have been completed.The authorization thus allows the board of directors to take into account  for example in relation to convertible debentures  the number of shares actually issued rather than the number of shares that could be issued based on the lowest conversion price of the convertible debenture  provided that conversion of previously issued convertible debentures under the authorization have been completed.

Baidu  Inc.  AiCure LLC  Arm Limited  H2O.ai  Inc.  Ayasdi AI LLC...,Global Market Insights Inc.Major decision intelligence market participants include Advanced Micro Devices  Inc.  Baidu  Inc.  AiCure LLC  Arm Limited  H2O.ai  Inc.  Ayasdi AI LLC  Clarifai  Inc.  and Enlitic  Inc.Selbyville  Delaware  April 11  2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --The decision intelligence market valuation is predicted to reach USD 25 billion by 2032  as reported in a research study by Global Market Insights Inc .Enterprises are focusing on eliminating human intervention for taking critical decisions based on incomplete data which is expanding the use of technology to forecast an intelligent solution  fueling the business revenue. Digitization in BFSI sector offers new opportunities to the industry players to develop innovative decision intelligence products and services  which is predictable to boost the market's demand. For instance  in June 2022 Quantexa  a leading worldwide supplier of Contextual Decision Intelligence solutions  announced the introduction of its inaugural Partner Program  a global framework to better support the growth and success of its consulting  delivery  technology  and data partners from the banking  government  insurance  and telecommunications sectors.The decision intelligence market from solution segment held over 25% revenue share in 2022  as more businesses integrate new capabilities to give asset managers the intelligence that they need to analyze market trends  better understand consumer behavior  and make better decisions about fund distribution for improved outcomes. For instance  in April 2022  FNZ  the global wealth management platform  and Clearstream  the post-trade services provider  partnered to significantly enhance support for asset managers by significantly increasing transparency across the entire industry through the launch of a new cutting-edge business intelligence solution for the UK and European asset management market.Request for a sample of this research report @ https://www.gminsights.com/request-sample/detail/5445Story continuesThe decision intelligence market from on-premises segment was over 30% of revenue share in 2022.

(""Pharming"") (Euronext Amsterdam: PHARM) (Nasdaq: PHAR) announces the first commercial shipments of Joenja¬Æ (leniolisib) to patients in...","LEIDEN  Netherlands  April 11  2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Pharming Group N.V. (""Pharming"") (Euronext Amsterdam: PHARM) (Nasdaq: PHAR) announces the first commercial shipments of Joenja¬Æ (leniolisib) to patients in the United States. Joenja¬Æ  an oral  selective PI3KŒ¥ inhibitor  is the first and only treatment approved in the U.S. for activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3KŒ¥) syndrome (APDS)  a rare and progressive primary immunodeficiency  in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older.Pharming Group NV logo (PRNewsfoto/Pharming Group N.V.)Under the terms of Pharming's 2019 exclusive license agreement with Novartis for leniolisib  the corresponding first commercial sale of Joenja¬Æ triggers a $10 million milestone payment by Pharming to Novartis.Stephen Toor  Chief Commercial Officer of Pharming  commented:""We are pleased to announce that the first Joenja¬Æ shipments to patients  with payor reimbursement  were delivered approximately two weeks following FDA approval  achieving an important milestone for patients suffering with APDS. We look forward to making Joenja¬Æ widely available across the U.S. as the first and only approved treatment for patients with APDS.""About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase Œ¥ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that was first characterized in 2013. APDS is caused by variants in either one of two identified genes known as PIK3CD or PIK3R1  which are vital to the development and function of immune cells in the body. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3KŒ¥ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway  which causes immune cells to fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.1 2 3 APDS is characterized by a variety of symptoms  including severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.4 5 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  it has been reported that people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.6 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.4-7 A definitive diagnosis can be made through genetic testing. APDS affects approximately 1 to 2 people per million worldwide.Story continuesAbout Joenja¬Æ (leniolisib)Joenja¬Æ (leniolisib) is an oral small molecule phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3K·∫ü) inhibitor approved in the US as the first and only targeted treatment of activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3KŒ¥) syndrome (APDS) in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older. Joenja¬Æ inhibits the production of phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate  which serves as an important cellular messenger and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Results from a randomized  placebo-controlled Phase II/III clinical trial demonstrated clinical efficacy of Joenja¬Æ in the co-primary endpoints; demonstrating statistically significant impact on immune dysregulation and normalization of immunophenotype within these patients  and interim open label extension data has supported the safety and tolerability of long-term Joenja¬Æ administration.8 Leniolisib is currently under regulatory review by the European Medicines Agency  with plans to pursue further regulatory approvals in the UK  Canada  Australia and Japan. Leniolisib is also being evaluated in a Phase III clinical trial in children aged 4 to 11 with APDS  with a further trial planned in children aged 1 to 6 years with APDS.

Sanofi has simplified its contractual arrangements relating to the development and commercialization of Beyfortus (nirsevimab) in the United States (U.S.).Under the new and updated arrangements  Sobi will terminate its participation agreement with AstraZeneca  and Sanofi and AstraZeneca will update the Collaboration Agreement so that Sanofi has full commercial control of nirsevimab in the U.S. Sanofi has simultaneously entered into a direct royalty agreement with Sobi to share a portion of U.S. net sales from nirsevimab.With respect to territories outside the U.S.  the existing Collaboration Agreement between AstraZeneca and Sanofi continues to govern that relationship.The new and updated contractual agreements do not impact nirsevimab registration and launch in the U.S.  where all parties remain committed to making Beyfortus available for all infants in time for the 2023/24 RSV season.About BeyfortusBeyfortus¬Æ (nirsevimab)  an investigational long-acting antibody designed to protect all infants against RSV infections from birth through their first RSV viral season with a single dose  is being co-developed by Sanofi and AstraZeneca. Beyfortus was developed to provide direct antibody protection to newborns and infants and protect them against lower respiratory tract infections caused by RSV. Monoclonal antibodies do not require activation of the immune system to confer direct and rapid protection against infection. Beyfortus has received marketing authorization in the European Union for the prevention of lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV in neonates and infants from birth during their first RSV season.Story continuesIn March 2017  AstraZeneca and Sanofi announced an agreement for the development and commercialization of Beyfortus. Under the agreement  AstraZeneca leads all development and manufacturing activities  while Sanofi is responsible for marketing activities and revenue recognition. Under the terms of the global agreement  Sanofi has made an upfront payment of ‚Ç¨120 million  a milestone payment of ‚Ç¨30 million and a regulatory payment of ‚Ç¨25 million. Sanofi shall pay up to ‚Ç¨440 million  subject to the achievement of a certain number of regulatory and sales objectives.

This update is in line with Vopak's strategic priorities to improve its financial and sustainability performance  to grow its base in industrial and gas terminals  and to accelerate towards new energies and sustainable feedstocks.Vopak to become shareholder in EemsEnergyTerminalGasunie and Vopak entered into a principle agreement whereby Vopak will acquire 50% of the shares in EemsEnergyTerminal B.V. This transaction will be subject to a number of conditions  including the approval from the competition authorities. The transaction is targeted to be completed latest by 1 October 2023.The EemsEnergyTerminal is an LNG import terminal located in the Eemshaven in the Netherlands. Gasunie developed this new floating LNG terminal in the Eemshaven area in response to gas supply insecurities and a desire to reduce the dependency on Russian gas. The LNG terminal has been operational since 15 September 2022 and has a regas capacity of 8 billion cubic meters per year. The partners will explore to increase the capacity further. This agreement highlights the commitment of Gasunie and Vopak to jointly develop and operate open access LNG infrastructure in the Netherlands and contribute to the energy security of Europe. The partners are planning the further development of the Eemshaven site to facilitate the import of green hydrogen.Ulco Vermeulen  director business development at Gasunie: ‚ÄúI am pleased with the intention of Vopak to become a co-shareholder in EemsEnergyTerminal  as our long-term partner in enabling energy import and terminalling. By pooling our knowledge and experience we will offer a unique and reliable LNG import solution and we will be even better positioned and committed to the future development of green hydrogen import infrastructure.‚ÄùStory continuesWalter Moone  president New Energies & LNG at Vopak: ‚ÄúWe are excited to build upon our successful partnership with Gasunie. This fits very well with Vopak‚Äôs strategy to grow in LNG infrastructure and accelerate towards new energies. We are proud to develop and operate reliable and open access infrastructure as this plays an important role both in the security of energy  as well as in the energy transition.‚ÄùGate terminal RotterdamVopak and Gasunie are the founders and owners of Gate terminal in Rotterdam which has been operational since 2011. The terminal has a current regas capacity of 16 billion cubic meters per year. The Open Season gauging market interest for an additional 4 billion cubic meters per year of regas capacity has recently been closed  a fourth tank would be constructed for this additional capacity. Gate will continue to develop this project  including financing with the aim to reach a final investment decision by September 2023. Once all envisaged projects at Gate terminal have been completed  the terminal will have a regas capacity of 20 billion cubic meters per year.Hong Kong LNG Terminal ProjectVopak has decided to no longer pursue the acquisition of 49.99% of the vessel owning company of MOL that owns a floating storage and regasification unit (FSRU). Vopak has been working with MOL for developing and commissioning the Hong Kong FSRU LNG terminal  and Vopak has contributed much to the establishment of a reliable system for the operation and maintenance of the terminal. Although the commercial start is expected later this year  the delay of the project has resulted in reduced attractiveness and made Vopak decide not to make use of the share right. Vopak will remain involved in the commissioning of the terminal and will continue to provide support to the operation of the terminal as required.Financial frameworkAs previously announced during Vopak's updates.- Vopak aims to improve the performance of the portfolio and targets an operating cash return of above 12% by 2025.- Vopak will grow its base in industrial and gas terminals by allocating EUR 1 billion to these activities by 2030.- Vopak will accelerate its portfolio investments towards new energies and sustainable feedstocks by allocating EUR 1 billion in growth capital to these activities by 2030.To reach these targets Vopak is having a disciplined approach to capital allocation. Vopak‚Äôs equity investments in EemsEnergyTerminal and Gate terminal are expected to be around EUR 100 million and will result in attractive operating cash return. There is no material financial impact for Vopak as a result of no longer pursuing the acquisition of 49.99% of the vessel owning company of MOL.Vopak will host an analysts‚Äô presentation with Vopak‚Äôs CFO  Michiel Gilsing via an on-demand audio webcast on Vopak‚Äôs corporate website  starting at 8:00 AM CEST on 11 April 2023.About Royal VopakRoyal Vopak is the world‚Äôs leading independent tank storage company.

The consolidated financial statements were appro‚Ä¶,"Bordeaux  11 April 2023 ‚Äì Hydrog√®ne de France (‚ÄúHDF Energy‚Äù or the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù ‚Äì Euronext Paris: HDF)  a global pioneer in high-power hydrogen power plants  presents its business activity and financial statements for the 2022 financial year. The consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors on 6 April 2023. The audit procedures on the consolidated financial statements have been completed and the auditors' report will be issued shortly.Key figures 2022 2021 Capacity of plants under development (MW) 751 591 Annual average headcount1 57 25 Revenues (‚Ç¨000) 3 462 885 Gains on sale of shares in subsidiaries2 (‚Ç¨000) 1 041 - Consolidated net income/(loss) (‚Ç¨000) (3 371) (3 520) Shareholders' equity (‚Ç¨000) 107 410 109 145 Cash and cash equivalents (‚Ç¨000) 87 359 95 123Employees and contractors in countries where the Company has no dedicated legal entity Investors taking shares in SPVsRobust project portfolioCommercial rollout remained the Group's main goal in 2022. The establishment of strong teams comprising 45 developers across all target regions (versus 23 at 31 December 2021) has allowed the Company to build a robust portfolio of large-scale projects and partnerships at 31 December 2022. As a result  the capacity of power plants under development in the portfolio increased over 25% versus 31 December 2021.Portfolio monitoring provides the earliest indicator of HDF's value creation for both the Group and all project stakeholders. HDF estimates that it is able to generate revenues representing between 12% and 17% of the cost of construction during the development and construction phases  including via the provision of engineering services and supply of fuel cells during the power plant construction phase.Strong revenue growth in 2022Consolidated revenues for 2022 totalled ‚Ç¨3.5 million versus ‚Ç¨0.9 million in 2021. This includes ‚Ç¨3.0 million recognised under the development contract for the Renewstable Barbados (RSB) project since February 2022  when the Rubis Group became RSB's majority shareholder.Furthermore  invoicing issued by HDF in 2022 for project management assistance services for projects over which the Group will retain control  the impact of which is eliminated in the consolidated financial statements  amounted to ‚Ç¨3.0 million. This value creation is recognised indirectly through gains or losses on disposal of the investments when control is lost.Accordingly  in 2022 the Group posted a ‚Ç¨1 million gain on disposal following the loss of control in RSB.Performance in line with strategic planThe acceleration of the development plan and team structuring led to an increase in operating expenses. Average headcount (employees and contractors) rose from 25 in 2021 to 57 in 2022.As a consequence  the consolidated net loss is monitored at ‚Ç¨3.4 million in 2022 compared to ‚Ç¨3.5 million in 2021.The 2021 net loss included non-recurring expenses such as IPO costs and the non-conversion premium on convertible bonds.Solid financial structure  promising outlookAt 31 December 2022  Group shareholders' equity stood at ‚Ç¨107.4 million compared to ‚Ç¨109.1 million at 31 December 2021. Cash and cash equivalents amounted to ‚Ç¨87.4 million versus ‚Ç¨95.1 million at 31 December 2021.As such  the Company's financial position allows to continue its development and accelerate its commercial rollout.As for the CEOG power plant in Guyana  various demonstrations have held up construction work  with limited financial consequences for the Group.Furthermore  the strong momentum observed in 2022 has continued into 2023 with the signing of partnerships  notably with the governments of Indonesia and Zimbabwe. HDF Energy is therefore entering the year 2023 with confidence.Lastly  HDF Energy reached a new milestone on 24 February 2023 by officially launching the construction of its manufacturing plant in France dedicated to the mass production of high-power fuel cells. The plant is expected to start operating in 2024 and to contribute towards achieving the Group's ambitions.Damien Havard  Chairman and CEO of Hydrog√®ne de France  said: ‚ÄúIn line with our strategic plan  in 2022 we stepped up prospecting and team structuring across all our regions. We made very concrete and material progress in all our regions. Our solid financial structure allows for a serene deployment of our operations in 2023.‚ÄùABOUT HYDROG√àNE DE FRANCE (HDF Energy)HDF Energy is a global pioneer in high-power hydrogen power plants.

Joenja¬Æ  an oral  selective PI3KŒ¥ inhibitor  is the first and only treatment a‚Ä¶,"LEIDEN  Netherlands  April 11  2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Pharming Group N.V. (""Pharming"") (Euronext Amsterdam: PHARM) (Nasdaq: PHAR) announces the first commercial shipments of Joenja¬Æ (leniolisib) to patients in the United States. Joenja¬Æ  an oral  selective PI3KŒ¥ inhibitor  is the first and only treatment approved in the U.S. for activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3KŒ¥) syndrome (APDS)  a rare and progressive primary immunodeficiency  in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older.Under the terms of Pharming's 2019 exclusive license agreement with Novartis for leniolisib  the corresponding first commercial sale of Joenja¬Æ triggers a $10 million milestone payment by Pharming to Novartis.Stephen Toor  Chief Commercial Officer of Pharming  commented:""We are pleased to announce that the first Joenja¬Æ shipments to patients  with payor reimbursement  were delivered approximately two weeks following FDA approval  achieving an important milestone for patients suffering with APDS. We look forward to making Joenja¬Æ widely available across the U.S. as the first and only approved treatment for patients with APDS.""About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase Œ¥ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that was first characterized in 2013. APDS is caused by variants in either one of two identified genes known as PIK3CD or PIK3R1  which are vital to the development and function of immune cells in the body. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3KŒ¥ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway  which causes immune cells to fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.1 2 3 APDS is characterized by a variety of symptoms  including severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.4 5 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  it has been reported that people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.6 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.4-7 A definitive diagnosis can be made through genetic testing. APDS affects approximately 1 to 2 people per million worldwide.About Joenja¬Æ (leniolisib)Joenja¬Æ (leniolisib) is an oral small molecule phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3K·∫ü) inhibitor approved in the US as the first and only targeted treatment of activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3KŒ¥) syndrome (APDS) in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older. Joenja¬Æ inhibits the production of phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate  which serves as an important cellular messenger and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Results from a randomized  placebo-controlled Phase II/III clinical trial demonstrated clinical efficacy of Joenja¬Æ in the co-primary endpoints; demonstrating statistically significant impact on immune dysregulation and normalization of immunophenotype within these patients  and interim open label extension data has supported the safety and tolerability of long-term Joenja¬Æ administration.8 Leniolisib is currently under regulatory review by the European Medicines Agency  with plans to pursue further regulatory approvals in the UK  Canada  Australia and Japan. Leniolisib is also being evaluated in a Phase III clinical trial in children aged 4 to 11 with APDS  with a further trial planned in children aged 1 to 6 years with APDS.

(""Pharming"") (Euronext Amsterdam: PHARM) (Nasdaq: PHAR) announces the first commercial shipments of Joenja¬Æ (leniolisib) to patients in the United States. Joenja¬Æ  an oral  selective PI3K‚Ä¶","LEIDEN  Netherlands  April 11  2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Pharming Group N.V. (""Pharming"") (Euronext Amsterdam: PHARM) (Nasdaq: PHAR) announces the first commercial shipments of Joenja¬Æ (leniolisib) to patients in the United States. Joenja¬Æ  an oral  selective PI3KŒ¥ inhibitor  is the first and only treatment approved in the U.S. for activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3KŒ¥) syndrome (APDS)  a rare and progressive primary immunodeficiency  in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older.Under the terms of Pharming's 2019 exclusive license agreement with Novartis for leniolisib  the corresponding first commercial sale of Joenja¬Æ triggers a $10 million milestone payment by Pharming to Novartis.Stephen Toor  Chief Commercial Officer of Pharming  commented:""We are pleased to announce that the first Joenja¬Æ shipments to patients  with payor reimbursement  were delivered approximately two weeks following FDA approval  achieving an important milestone for patients suffering with APDS. We look forward to making Joenja¬Æ widely available across the U.S. as the first and only approved treatment for patients with APDS.""About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase Œ¥ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that was first characterized in 2013. APDS is caused by variants in either one of two identified genes known as PIK3CD or PIK3R1  which are vital to the development and function of immune cells in the body. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3KŒ¥ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway  which causes immune cells to fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.1 2 3 APDS is characterized by a variety of symptoms  including severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.4 5 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  it has been reported that people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.6 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.4-7 A definitive diagnosis can be made through genetic testing. APDS affects approximately 1 to 2 people per million worldwide.About Joenja¬Æ (leniolisib)Joenja¬Æ (leniolisib) is an oral small molecule phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3K·∫ü) inhibitor approved in the US as the first and only targeted treatment of activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3KŒ¥) syndrome (APDS) in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older. Joenja¬Æ inhibits the production of phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate  which serves as an important cellular messenger and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Results from a randomized  placebo-controlled Phase II/III clinical trial demonstrated clinical efficacy of Joenja¬Æ in the co-primary endpoints; demonstrating statistically significant impact on immune dysregulation and normalization of immunophenotype within these patients  and interim open label extension data has supported the safety and tolerability of long-term Joenja¬Æ administration.8 Leniolisib is currently under regulatory review by the European Medicines Agency  with plans to pursue further regulatory approvals in the UK  Canada  Australia and Japan. Leniolisib is also being evaluated in a Phase III clinical trial in children aged 4 to 11 with APDS  with a further trial planned in children aged 1 to 6 years with APDS.

Sanofi has simplified its contractual arrangements relating to the development and commercialization of Beyfortus (nirsevimab) in the United States (U.S.).Under the new and updated arrangements  Sobi will terminate its participation agreement with AstraZeneca  and Sanofi and AstraZeneca will update the Collaboration Agreement so that Sanofi has full commercial control of nirsevimab in the U.S. Sanofi has simultaneously entered into a direct royalty agreement with Sobi to share a portion of U.S. net sales from nirsevimab.With respect to territories outside the U.S.  the existing Collaboration Agreement between AstraZeneca and Sanofi continues to govern that relationship.The new and updated contractual agreements do not impact nirsevimab registration and launch in the U.S.  where all parties remain committed to making Beyfortus available for all infants in time for the 2023/24 RSV season.About BeyfortusBeyfortus¬Æ (nirsevimab)  an investigational long-acting antibody designed to protect all infants against RSV infections from birth through their first RSV viral season with a single dose  is being co-developed by Sanofi and AstraZeneca. Beyfortus was developed to provide direct antibody protection to newborns and infants and protect them against lower respiratory tract infections caused by RSV. Monoclonal antibodies do not require activation of the immune system to confer direct and rapid protection against infection. Beyfortus has received marketing authorization in the European Union for the prevention of lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV in neonates and infants from birth during their first RSV season.In March 2017  AstraZeneca and Sanofi announced an agreement for the development and commercialization of Beyfortus. Under the agreement  AstraZeneca leads all development and manufacturing activities  while Sanofi is responsible for marketing activities and revenue recognition. Under the terms of the global agreement  Sanofi has made an upfront payment of ‚Ç¨120 million  a milestone payment of ‚Ç¨30 million and a regulatory payment of ‚Ç¨25 million. Sanofi shall pay up to ‚Ç¨440 million  subject to the achievement of a certain number of regulatory and sales objectives.

CiROCCO forms a key part of the EU's Horizon Europe Progamme  a funding programme for research and innovation with a budget of ‚Ç¨95.5 billion. The CiROCCO research project aims to establish a low-cost and sustainable network of electronic sensing nodes in under-sampled desert areas and ecosystems in Egypt  Serbia and Spain. Astrocast will be involved in CiROCCO's Benban solar farm project in Egypt  where SatIoT will support with renewable energy systems (RES) planning.CiROCCO project objectivesCiROCCO was founded on March 1  2023. Over the next three years  a consortium of twelve organisations  including universities  governments  NGOs and enterprises will drive the initiative forward. Key objectives include:To provide high-quality data for the research community to use to enhance climate change models and support the European Green Deal challenges.Integrating and assimilating in-situ data with Earth Observation data coming from the EU's Copernicus programme - which is the Earth observation component of the EU's Space programme  looking at our planet and its environment  to benefit all European citizens. Importantly  it offers information services that draw from satellite Earth Observation and in-situ (non-space) data.with Earth Observation data coming from the EU's Copernicus programme - which is the Earth observation component of the EU's Space programme  looking at our planet and its environment  to benefit all European citizens. Importantly  it offers information services that draw from satellite Earth Observation and in-situ (non-space) data. Accelerate the wider community's adoption of CiROCCO tools and services that are developed to maximise impact and success for participating parties.Benban solar farm project  EgyptBroadly speaking  CiROCCO aims to collect data from low-cost  stand-alone  electronic sensing nodes  in addition to higher-quality  off-the-self  sensing stations and medium-cost portable sun photometers through mobile monitoring devices. Astrocast's involvement here will primarily focus on a Renewable Energy Systems (RES) Planning pilot project at the Benban solar farm  Egypt. Astrocast's SatIoT connectivity will allow data transmission to take place in this remote location between the various sensors and their operational teams  enabling them to transmit  access and interpret the data they need.For example  sensor information that is transmitted via Astrocast's SatIoT will be used to deliver a data modelling infrastructure. This will enable this project to manage energy and optimise production more effectively. It includes tracking solar radiation measurements - to harmonise this with actual power production  for data assimilation into solar energy models and for forecasting purposes.Wind speed and direction will be tracked. This will help provide information about dust forecasting and load estimation. Dust modelling will be compared with air quality quantification. Temperature and humidity of the solar panels will be monitored too  and this will help the operator to ensure optimal operating conditions and manage maintenance alerts relating to solar panel efficiency.The Benban solar farm will also use the information that it gathers about real power and energy production to validate the observational and modelling approaches that are being deployed. As a result  the project hopes to develop a sophisticated  dedicated energy management system for the Benban solar project - and a more powerful model that other organisations can learn from  replicate and apply to other solar farms in Egypt and across the world.""Astrocast is dedicated to providing global IoT connectivity. We are proud to be part of the CiROCCO initiative  and to contribute our expertise to establish a low-cost and sustainable network of electronic sensing nodes in under-sampled desert areas. We believe that the data generated from this initiative will play a crucial role in enhancing climate change models and supporting the European Green Deal challenges. Furthermore  by participating in the Renewable Energy Systems Planning pilot project in Egypt  we aim to leverage our satellite technology to optimise energy production and contribute to developing a dedicated energy management system for the Benban solar project and beyond."" says Fabien Jordan  CEO  Astrocast says Fabien Jordan  CEO  AstrocastThe consortium of organisations participating in the CiROCCO research project will collaborate closely with post-project operating entities to achieve the critical objectives of the CiROCCO project.

Sanofi has simplified its contractual arrangements relating to the development and commercialization of Beyfortus (nirsevimab) in the United States (U.S.).Under the new and updated arrangements  Sobi will terminate its participation agreement with AstraZeneca  and Sanofi and AstraZeneca will update the Collaboration Agreement so that Sanofi has full commercial control of nirsevimab in the U.S. Sanofi has simultaneously entered into a direct royalty agreement with Sobi to share a portion of U.S. net sales from nirsevimab.With respect to territories outside the U.S.  the existing Collaboration Agreement between AstraZeneca and Sanofi continues to govern that relationship.The new and updated contractual agreements do not impact nirsevimab registration and launch in the U.S.  where all parties remain committed to making Beyfortus available for all infants in time for the 2023/24 RSV season.About BeyfortusBeyfortus¬Æ (nirsevimab)  an investigational long-acting antibody designed to protect all infants against RSV infections from birth through their first RSV viral season with a single dose  is being co-developed by Sanofi and AstraZeneca. Beyfortus was developed to provide direct antibody protection to newborns and infants and protect them against lower respiratory tract infections caused by RSV. Monoclonal antibodies do not require activation of the immune system to confer direct and rapid protection against infection. Beyfortus has received marketing authorization in the European Union for the prevention of lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV in neonates and infants from birth during their first RSV season.In March 2017  AstraZeneca and Sanofi announced an agreement for the development and commercialization of Beyfortus. Under the agreement  AstraZeneca leads all development and manufacturing activities  while Sanofi is responsible for marketing activities and revenue recognition. Under the terms of the global agreement  Sanofi has made an upfront payment of ‚Ç¨120 million  a milestone payment of ‚Ç¨30 million and a regulatory payment of ‚Ç¨25 million. Sanofi shall pay up to ‚Ç¨440 million  subject to the achievement of a certain number of regulatory and sales objectives.

OTHER RESTRICTIONS ARE APPLICABLE. PLEASE SEE THE IMPORTANT NOTICE AT THE END OF THE PRESS RELEASETrondheim  Norway-CrayoNano AS (""CrayoNano"" or the ""Company"") is contemplating to raise gross proceeds in the range of approx. NOK 100 - 150 million through issuance of new ordinary shares (the ""Offer Shares"") in the Company (the ""Private Placement""). The net proceeds of the Private Placement to the Company will be used to accelerate operations  acquire patent rights  and invest in manufacturing capacity and flexibility  reducing risks around supply chain disruption and product quality  as well as for general corporate purposes. The Company's board of directors (the ""Board"") has resolved to pursue a listing on Euronext Growth Oslo within the next 12 months.CrayoNano has entered into a term sheet with the European Innovation Council (""EIC"") Fund where they have pre-committed to subscribe for Offer Shares for an amount of up to the NOK equivalent of EUR 5 million at the subscription price per Offer Share in the Private Placement (the ""Offer Price"") subject to certain terms and conditions being fulfilled. Any subscription from EIC Fund is subject to  inter alia  CrayoNano raising gross proceeds in the Private Placement of an amount equal to or exceeding the NOK equivalent of EUR 5 million from other investors than EIC Fund  of which new investors constitute minimum 25%  (the ""Matching Capital"") and KYC verification by EIC Fund of all investors constituting the Matching Capital. If the Matching Capital is below the NOK equivalent of EUR 5 million  the EIC commitment will be reduced correspondingly. Following the Private Placement  EIC Fund will be assigned with one board observer seat.Further  CrayoNano's three largest shareholders  Nordic Technology Group AS  SpareBank 1 SMN Invest AS and Skips AS Tudor have shown strong support and have earlier this year granted a bridge loan to the Company  which together with accrued interests constitutes approximately NOK 28.05 million  that will be converted to equity at the Offer Price as part of the Private Placement and will be eligible as Matching Capital (the ""Loan Conversion""). The Company has entered into a guarantee commission agreement with Nordic Technology Group AS pursuant to which Nordic Technology Group AS shall receive a commission of 2% of the size of the Private Placement for providing a customary indemnity undertaking on behalf of the Company in connection with the Private Placement.Members of the Board and management  and Nordic Technology Group AS  have all agreed to a 12-month lock-up  subject to customary exemptions.The Offer Price will be determined through an accelerated bookbuilding process. The bookbuilding period in the Private Placement starts today  11 April 2023  at 09:00 CEST and ends at 16:30 CEST on 14 April 2023. The Company may at its sole discretion extend or shorten the application period at any time and for any reason.The Private Placement will be directed towards selected Norwegian and international investors  in each case subject to and in compliance with applicable exemptions from relevant prospectus  filing and other registration requirements. The minimum application and allocation amount in the Private Placement has been set to the NOK equivalent of EUR 100 000. The Company may  however  at its sole discretion  allocate an amount below EUR 100 000 to the extent applicable exemptions from the prospectus requirement pursuant to the Norwegian Securities Trading Act and ancillary regulations (including Regulation (EU) 2017/1129) are available.The final number of Offer Shares to be issued and conditional allocation of the Offer Shares will be made by the Board at its sole discretion at the end of the application period. Notification of conditional allocations are expected to be distributed by the Managers on or about 17 April 2023. Settlement of the Offer Shares will take place on a delivery versus payment (""DVP"") basis following approval by a general meeting in the Company (expected to be held on or about 24 April 2023) (the ""GM"") and registration in the Norwegian Register of Business Enterprises (including customary case handling) and will be facilitated by a prepayment agreement expected to be entered into between CrayoNano and the Managers.The Board will propose to establish an option scheme to be directed at employees who are not founders of the Company for such number of additional options required to achieve a total number of distributed options corresponding to 10% of the fully diluted share capital of the Company after the Private Placement (the ""Offering Option Scheme""). The options issued pursuant to the Offering Option Scheme shall be issued with strike price equal to the Offer Price.Completion of the Private Placement will be subject to (i) the EIC KYC verification being completed to the satisfaction of EIC Fund  (ii) that EIC Fund has been granted access to listen in on a customary bring-down due diligence call between the Managers and the Company to be held prior to the GM and the content of and disclosures made in the bring down due diligence call are satisfactory to EIC Fund  (iii) any and all information that has been made available to EIC Fund that constitute inside information has been made duly available to the public or lapsed prior giving effect to EIC Fund's subscription in the Private Placement  (iv) the Company giving EIC Fund certain customary representations and warranties  (v) the Loan Conversion having taken place  (vi) the Board resolving to consummate the Private Placement and allocate the Offer Shares  (vii) the GM resolving to approve the Private Placement and issue the Offer Shares  (viii) payment being received for all of the Offer Shares  (ix) the Board and the GM to approve the Offering Option Scheme  including the GM authorizing the Board to issue the corresponding shares and (x) registration in the Norwegian Register of Business Enterprises of the share capital increase in the Company pertaining to the Private Placement and the allocated Offer Shares being validly issued and registered in the VPS. The Company and the Managers reserve the right  at any time and for any reason  to cancel  and/or modify the terms of  the Private Placement. Neither the Managers nor the Company will be liable for any losses incurred by applicants if the Private Placement is cancelled  irrespective of the reason for such cancellation.The Private Placement implies a deviation from the existing shareholders' pre-emptive right to subscribe for the Offer Shares. The Board has considered the Private Placement in light of the equal treatment obligations set out in the Private Limited Liability Companies Act and deemed that the proposed Private Placement is in compliance with these obligations. The Board emphasises that by structuring the equity raise as a private placement  the Company is expected to raise equity efficiently  with a lower discount to the last registered trading price on NOTC  at a lower cost and with a significantly reduced completion risk compared to a rights issue. The Company may  subject to completion of the Private Placement and certain other conditions  consider a subsequent repair offering of new shares at the same subscription price as the Private Placement and otherwise in line with market practice.The Private Placement is directed towards investors subject to applicable exemptions from relevant prospectus requirements  (i) outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S under the US Securities Act of 1933 (the ""US Securities Act"") and (ii) in the United States to ""qualified institutional buyers"" (QIBs) as defined in Rule 144A under the US Securities Act. The minimum application and allocation amount has been set to the NOK equivalent of EUR 100 000.An updated company presentation is uploaded on the Company's web site.DNB Markets  a part of DNB Bank ASA; and SpareBank 1 Markets AS are acting as Joint Bookrunners (together  the ""Managers"") in connection with the Private Placement. Advokatfirmaet Wiersholm AS is acting as legal advisor to the Company.For further information  please contact:Jo Uthus  CEOTel: +47 47 38 06 34Email: jo.uthus@crayonano.comJens Kielland  CFOTel: +47 95 81 55 81Email: jens.kielland@crayonano.com***About CrayoNano ASFounded in 2012  CrayoNano develops and manufactures nanomaterials-based semiconductor components using proprietary technologies.

This update is in line with Vopak's strategic priorities to improve its financial and sustainability performance  to grow its base in industrial and gas terminals  and to accelerate towards new energies and sustainable feedstocks.Vopak to become shareholder in EemsEnergyTerminalGasunie and Vopak entered into a principle agreement whereby Vopak will acquire 50% of the shares in EemsEnergyTerminal B.V. This transaction will be subject to a number of conditions  including the approval from the competition authorities. The transaction is targeted to be completed latest by 1 October 2023.The EemsEnergyTerminal is an LNG import terminal located in the Eemshaven in the Netherlands. Gasunie developed this new floating LNG terminal in the Eemshaven area in response to gas supply insecurities and a desire to reduce the dependency on Russian gas. The LNG terminal has been operational since 15 September 2022 and has a regas capacity of 8 billion cubic meters per year. The partners will explore to increase the capacity further. This agreement highlights the commitment of Gasunie and Vopak to jointly develop and operate open access LNG infrastructure in the Netherlands and contribute to the energy security of Europe. The partners are planning the further development of the Eemshaven site to facilitate the import of green hydrogen.Ulco Vermeulen  director business development at Gasunie: ‚ÄúI am pleased with the intention of Vopak to become a co-shareholder in EemsEnergyTerminal  as our long-term partner in enabling energy import and terminalling. By pooling our knowledge and experience we will offer a unique and reliable LNG import solution and we will be even better positioned and committed to the future development of green hydrogen import infrastructure.‚ÄùWalter Moone  president New Energies & LNG at Vopak: ‚ÄúWe are excited to build upon our successful partnership with Gasunie. This fits very well with Vopak‚Äôs strategy to grow in LNG infrastructure and accelerate towards new energies. We are proud to develop and operate reliable and open access infrastructure as this plays an important role both in the security of energy  as well as in the energy transition.‚ÄùGate terminal RotterdamVopak and Gasunie are the founders and owners of Gate terminal in Rotterdam which has been operational since 2011. The terminal has a current regas capacity of 16 billion cubic meters per year. The Open Season gauging market interest for an additional 4 billion cubic meters per year of regas capacity has recently been closed  a fourth tank would be constructed for this additional capacity. Gate will continue to develop this project  including financing with the aim to reach a final investment decision by September 2023. Once all envisaged projects at Gate terminal have been completed  the terminal will have a regas capacity of 20 billion cubic meters per year.Hong Kong LNG Terminal ProjectVopak has decided to no longer pursue the acquisition of 49.99% of the vessel owning company of MOL that owns a floating storage and regasification unit (FSRU). Vopak has been working with MOL for developing and commissioning the Hong Kong FSRU LNG terminal  and Vopak has contributed much to the establishment of a reliable system for the operation and maintenance of the terminal. Although the commercial start is expected later this year  the delay of the project has resulted in reduced attractiveness and made Vopak decide not to make use of the share right. Vopak will remain involved in the commissioning of the terminal and will continue to provide support to the operation of the terminal as required.Financial frameworkAs previously announced during Vopak's updates.- Vopak aims to improve the performance of the portfolio and targets an operating cash return of above 12% by 2025.- Vopak will grow its base in industrial and gas terminals by allocating EUR 1 billion to these activities by 2030.- Vopak will accelerate its portfolio investments towards new energies and sustainable feedstocks by allocating EUR 1 billion in growth capital to these activities by 2030.To reach these targets Vopak is having a disciplined approach to capital allocation. Vopak‚Äôs equity investments in EemsEnergyTerminal and Gate terminal are expected to be around EUR 100 million and will result in attractive operating cash return. There is no material financial impact for Vopak as a result of no longer pursuing the acquisition of 49.99% of the vessel owning company of MOL.Vopak will host an analysts‚Äô presentation with Vopak‚Äôs CFO  Michiel Gilsing via an on-demand audio webcast on Vopak‚Äôs corporate website  starting at 8:00 AM CEST on 11 April 2023.About Royal VopakRoyal Vopak is the world‚Äôs leading independent tank storage company.

The full document is available to download from the financial reports section of the Company's web site at: .,(MENAFN- GlobeNewsWire - Nasdaq) PRESS RELEASE ‚Äì REGULATED INFORMATION HYBRID SOFTWARE GROUP PLC REPORTS STRONG 2022 RESULTS WITH ‚Ç¨4 6.7 MILLION REVENUE AND ‚Ç¨ 10.9 MILLION EBITDA Cambridge ( UK )  12 April 20 2 3 ( 0 7 :00 CE S T) : Hybrid Software Group PLC (Euronext: HYSG) announces that it has published its annual report and financial statements for the financial year ended 31 December 2022. The full document is available to download from the financial reports section of the Company's web site at: . CEO Mike Rottenborn comments ‚ÄúWe entered 2022 with bullish growth projections until the economic downturn began to affect our OEM and our end-user business. In addition  during the first half of the year our revenues were impacted by the global shortage of semiconductor chips. Meteor Inkjet's revenue fell short of projections by more than ¬£4 million during this period. Their team quickly redesigned a critical circuit board using a chip that was more widely available  but the lost first-half revenue was not fully recovered in 2022. I'm pleased to say that 2023 has started very strongly for Meteor  with revenues recovering to healthy levels and demand from China increasing rapidly. ‚ÄúDespite all the challenges  we completed two strategic acquisitions  sold an old and unused intangible asset for net ‚Ç¨3.3 million  achieved four new patents  and drew the constituent parts of the business closer together into one company  reorganising R&D resources and pushing ahead with product innovation to the benefit of our customers. There's no doubt that Hybrid Software Group has emerged from 2022 as a stronger company. We have best-in-class technology  a sound business plan focussed on markets that are trending upwards  and strong cash position of Euros 6.3 million.‚Äù Executive Chairman Guido Van der Schueren adds ‚Äú2022 was a year of mixed results and we fell short of our growth projections in both revenue and net profit. We acted quickly in response  taking prudent steps to conserve cash and reduce our cost structure  especially external spending. But we never sacrificed the long-term value of Hybrid Software Group. We did not cut any of our key personnel or reduce R&D spending  and if anything  we stepped up our sales efforts and increased the company's presence at key trade shows and industry events. We have broadened our potential customer reach by offering successful products for all digital printing applications and I anticipate a much higher level of growth and profitability in the very near future.‚Äù Financial highlight sFor the year ended 31 December In thousands of euros 202 2 2021 Continuing operations Revenue 46 693 48 562 Operating profit 2 274 4 770 Profit before tax 1 835 4 565 Tax (charge)/credit (535) 349 Profit from continuing operations 1 300 4 914 EBITDA - continuing operations 10 895 12 211 Adjusted operating profit - continuing operations 2 106 7 308 Adjusted net profit - continuing operations 945 6 390 Basic earnings per share (euro) - continuing operations 0.04 0.15 Adjusted earnings per share (euro) - continuing operations 0.03 0.20 Available cash 6 317 9 234The consolidated pre-tax result for continuing operations was ‚Ç¨1.84 million compared with a profit of ‚Ç¨4.57 million in 2021. The decrease in profitability of ‚Ç¨2.73 million was due to:a decrease in revenue of ‚Ç¨1.87 million;a decrease in cost of sales of ‚Ç¨1.09 million;an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses of ‚Ç¨4.38 million;an increase in research and development expenses of ‚Ç¨0.78 million;a decrease in other operating expenses of ‚Ç¨0.18 million;an increase in other income of ‚Ç¨3.27 million;an increase in net finance expenses of ‚Ç¨0.79 million; and a decrease in foreign exchange losses of ‚Ç¨0.55 million.Revenue for the Printing Software segment was ‚Ç¨15.26 million for the year (2021: ‚Ç¨13.84 million).Revenue for the Printhead Solutions segment was ‚Ç¨8.66 million for the year (2021: ‚Ç¨13.98 million). This segment was severely impacted by the shortage of its most commonly used chip until a critical circuit board was redesigned using a different component in mid-2022.Revenue for the Enterprise Software segment was ‚Ç¨22.78 million for the year (2021: ‚Ç¨20.74 million).Gross profit for the period increased to 84.2% of revenue (2021: 82.5%)  primarily due to the higher mix ofsoftware related sales during the year  particularly higher margin sales to end users by HYBRID Software.Included in selling  general and administrative expenses is amortisation of ‚Ç¨1.17 million (2021: ‚Ç¨0.84 million)related to intangible assets recognised as a result of acquisitions.Research and development expenses includes the capitalisation and amortisation of internally generated intangible assets and the amortisation of certain intangible assets recognised as a result of acquisitions. During the period there was a net capitalisation of development expenditure of ‚Ç¨2.00 million (2021: ‚Ç¨2.39 million) and amortisation of acquired intangible assets of ‚Ç¨5.10 million (2021: ‚Ç¨3.93 million).The net capitalisation of development expenditure comprised ‚Ç¨4.0 million (2021: ‚Ç¨3.40 million) of capitalised expenditure less ‚Ç¨2.0 million (2021: ‚Ç¨1.01 million) of amortisation.The third quarter results were favourably impacted by the sale of an unused asset (approximately 69 000 IPv4 internet addresses) for a net amount of ‚Ç¨3.3 million which closed in July. Given the nature of the sale this income is reported as‚ÄúOther Income‚Äù and is not included in our revenue figures  but it is accretive to EBITDA.Total operating expenses increased by ‚Ç¨4.98 million  or 14.1% compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase was mainly due to higher sales & marketing related expenditures  increased amortization expenses and higher staff cost resulting from the acquisitions of ColorLogic and Hybrid Iberia in Q4 2021  and iC3D in Q1 2022.Foreign exchange gains and losses were primarily due to the revaluation of currency balances held at the balance sheet date and the change in exchange rates during the year.The Company presents EBITDA (earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortisation) and adjusted profit when reporting its financial results to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate the Group's results in a manner that focuses on what the Group believes to be its underlying business operations. The Group's management believes that the inclusion of adjusted financial results provides consistency and comparability with past reports.Additional commentary and analysis of the Company's consolidated results for the year ending 31 December 2022 can be found in the annual report and financial statements.Should you wish to receive a printed copy of the annual report  please send an e-mail to p or make your request in writing  for the attention of the Company's Chief Financial Officer  to 2030 Cambourne Business Park  Cambourne  Cambridge  CB23 6DW  UK.Annual General MeetingThe Company will hold its annual general meeting on Wednesday 24 May 2023.
