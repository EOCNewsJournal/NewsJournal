22716,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/artmarket-com-works-co-signed-123000399.html,Artmarket.com: works co-signed by Jean-Michel Basquiat and Andy Warhol are currently showing at the Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris. Artprice takes a look at their market,While a canvas by Andy Warhol generated the art auction market's second best-ever result last year (at $195 million) and a work by Jean-Michel Basquiat...,"PARIS  April 12  2023 /PRNewswire/ -- While a canvas by Andy Warhol generated the art auction market's second best-ever result last year (at $195 million) and a work by Jean-Michel Basquiat fetched over $110 million in 2017  the prices of works jointly produced by the two artists peaked at $14 million almost nine years ago. But that value differential hasn't discouraged the Louis Vuitton Foundation from organizing a major exhibition of the works co-signed by the two most emblematic figures of the New York scene of the 1960s and 80s.Portraits of Andy Warhol and Jean-Michel Basquiat ¬©thierry Ehrmann - Courtesy Mus√©e L‚ÄôOrgane / La Demeure du Chaos ‚Äì Abode of Chaos""Veritable pillars of the art market  ranked 1st and 7th in Artprice's 2022 global ranking by annual auction turnover (all periods combined)  Andy Warhol and Jean-Michel Basquiat worked together for three years "" says thierry Ehrmann  CEO of Artmarket.com and Founder of Artprice. ""Together  they created several monumental pieces  some several meters long  but which do not always have the strength of the works they created alone. At least  that is what art auction market stats suggest"".A well-orchestrated collaborationIn 1982  gallery owner Bruno Bischofberger officially presented the young Jean-Michel Basquiat to the famous Andy Warhol. They soon began to work together  along with Italian artist Francesco Clemente  painting one after the other on the same canvases. Fruit of this triple collaboration  the work Origin of Cotton (1984) was first sold at auction in 1992 at Christie's in London for $95 700. In 2018 it sold a second time at Sotheby's for $592 000 (incl. fees). For a canvas measuring 130 by 180 cm and signed by three such prestigious artists  that price seemed almost too reasonable.www.artprice.com/artist/763353/jean-michel-&-francesco-&-andy-basquiat-&-clemente-&-warhol/painting/15326208/origin-of-cottonWithin a short time  the two American stars decide to continue the collaboration alone  eventually leading to a major New York exhibition in the fall of 1985  less than two years before Warhol's death and a little less than three years before that of Jean-Michel Basquiat. The now iconic exhibition poster features them as boxers on a yellow background  haloed with red stars. The two artists are placed at the same height but already seem to be moving slightly apart.Story continuesIt's the story of this collaboration that the Louis Vuitton Foundation (designed by Frank Gehry in Paris's Bois de Boulogne) has decided to focus on (5 April to 28 August 2023). And although the story has two great giants of American painting as its principal protagonists  the commercial success of their joint works appears to have been somewhat tarnished by an inevitable clash of egos. In any case  the exhibition is perhaps most of all an opportunity to witness the meeting of two artistic currents  epitomized by two artists who were very close and yet very different  surrounded by Keith Haring  Madonna and a number of other celebrities  against a backdrop of Pop  Jazz‚Ä¶ and the post-modern American Dream.What does the art market think?The works created jointly by Warhol & Basquiat have come nowhere near the record valuations generated by the two artists individually. So  while they are not without value  collectors feel that their quality does not quite equal the sum of their two parts. Although we can easily see the liberated lines of Jean-Michel-Basquiat coupled with Andy Warhol's serigraphic style  and although they apparently swapped roles and techniques  these works seem to lack the full power of Basquiat or the full bewitchment of Warhol. So  at the end of the day  their value is essentially based on their two signatures.The opinions of collectors are amply reflected in the auctions results. The auction record for a work by the Warhol/Basquiat duo is currently that hammered in 2014 for the canvas Zenith (1985) at $11.4 million at Phillips in New York. Since then  13 canvases signed by the two artists have been to auction ‚Äì several of which are currently showing at the Louis Vuitton Foundation ‚Äì without ever approaching the personal bests of the two artists (both of which are over $100 million):- Wood (1984): $2.4 million in 2016- Sweet Pungent (1984/85): $5.7 million in 2017- Taxi  45th/Broadway (c.1984/85): $9.4 million in 2018In 2022  GE/Skull (1984/85) and 1/2 Keep Frozen (1984-1985) sold for $4.6 million and $3 million respectively at Christie's in New York. However  they belonged to the collection of Thomas Ammann alongside Shot Sage Marilyn Blue (1964) by Andy Warhol  the same canvas that fetched $195 million (incl. fees) on 9 May 2022. Thomas Ammann also owned a painting by Francesco Clemente entitled The fourteen stations  No. XI (1981/82)  which generated a new record for the artist at $1.8 million (versus Christie's estimate of $80 000 - $120 000).www.christies.com/en/auction/the-collection-of-thomas-and-doris-ammann-evening-sale-29836/browse-lotsA collaboration to revive each other's careersWhen they started working together in 1984  Andy Warhol was 57 and Jean-Michel Basquiat was 24. Yet in the eyes of the market  the best of their respective productions were already behind them. Our auction data shows that the most sought-after works by Andy Warhol are those created in 1962-1964  and in the case of Jean-Michel Basquiat  the year 1982 is considered his best creative period.What historians see in this union is  at least partly  the desire of a young painter to learn from a superstar and develop his brand image  and in return  Warhol's desire to work with a rising young talent. Curiously  it seems it was the older of the two who benefited most from this collaboration since it was Warhol who experienced another prosperous year (from a career perspective) in 1986  with  among other things  the production of a series of self-portraits and several canvases around the theme of Leonardo da Vinci's Last Supper.When Andy Warhol died on 22 February 1987 he left Jean-Michel Basquiat in the grips of his demons  and a year and a half later  on 12 August 1988  Basquiat died of a drug overdose at just 27.Images:[https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/04/image1-artmarket-artprice-Andy-Warhol-Jean-Michel-Basquiat-copyright-thierry-Ehrmann-courtesy-Organ-Museum-Abode-of-Chaos.jpg][https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/04/image2-artmarket-artprice-auction-turnover-per-year-Andy-Warhol-and-Jean-Michel-Basquiat.png]Copyright 1987-2023 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to contact our Econometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: econometrics@artprice.comTry our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demoSubscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket.com is owned by Server Group  which is the main shareholder and founder.Artmarket.com is a global player in the Art Market with  among other structures  its Artprice department  world leader in the accumulation  management and exploitation of historical and current art market information in databanks containing over 30 million indices and auction results  covering more than 810 000 artists.Artprice Images¬Æ allows unlimited access to the largest Art Market image bank in the world: no less than 180 million digital images of photographs or engraved reproductions of artworks from 1700 to the present day  commented by our art historians.Artmarket with its Artprice department accumulates data on a permanent basis from 6500 Auction Houses and produces key Art Market information for the main press and media agencies (7 200 publications).

Artprice takes a look at their market,(marketscreener.com)  While a canvas by Andy Warhol generated the art auction market's second best-ever result last year and a work by Jean-Michel Basquiat fetched over $110 million in 2017  the prices of works jointly produced by the two artists peaked at ‚Ä¶,"While a canvas by Andy Warhol generated the art auction market's second best-ever result last year (at $195 million) and a work by Jean-Michel Basquiat fetched over $110 million in 2017  the prices of works jointly produced by the two artists peaked at $14 million almost nine years ago. But that value differential hasn't discouraged the Louis Vuitton Foundation from organizing a major exhibition of the works co-signed by the two most emblematic figures of the New York scene of the 1960s and 80s.Portraits of Andy Warhol and Jean-Michel Basquiat ¬©thierry Ehrmann - Courtesy Mus√©e l'Organe / La Demeure du Chaos ‚Äì Abode of Chaos[ https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/04/image1-artmarket-artprice-Andy-Warhol-Jean-Michel-Basquiat-copyright-thierry-Ehrmann-courtesy-Organ-Museum-Abode-of-Chaos.jpg ]Auction turnover per year of creation for works by Andy Warhol and Jean-Michel Basquiat separately (1995 ‚Äì 2022)[ https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/04/image2-artmarket-artprice-auction-turnover-per-year-Andy-Warhol-and-Jean-Michel-Basquiat.png ]‚ÄúVeritable pillars of the art market  ranked 1st and 7th in Artprice's 2022 global ranking by annual auction turnover (all periods combined)  Andy Warhol and Jean-Michel Basquiat worked together for three years ‚Äù says thierry Ehrmann  CEO of Artmarket.com and Founder of Artprice. ‚ÄúTogether  they created several monumental pieces  some several meters long  but which do not always have the strength of the works they created alone. At least  that is what art auction market stats suggest‚Äù.A well-orchestrated collaborationIn 1982  gallery owner Bruno Bischofberger officially presented the young Jean-Michel Basquiat to the famous Andy Warhol. They soon began to work together  along with Italian artist Francesco Clemente  painting one after the other on the same canvases. Fruit of this triple collaboration  the work Origin of Cotton (1984) was first sold at auction in 1992 at Christie's in London for $95 700. In 2018 it sold a second time at Sotheby's for $592 000 (incl. fees). For a canvas measuring 130 by 180 cm and signed by three such prestigious artists  that price seemed almost too reasonable.www.artprice.com/artist/763353/jean-michel-&-francesco-&-andy-basquiat-&-clemente-&-warhol/painting/15326208/origin-of-cottonWithin a short time  the two American stars decide to continue the collaboration alone  eventually leading to a major New York exhibition in the fall of 1985  less than two years before Warhol's death and a little less than three years before that of Jean-Michel Basquiat. The now iconic exhibition poster features them as boxers on a yellow background  haloed with red stars. The two artists are placed at the same height but already seem to be moving slightly apart.It's the story of this collaboration that the Louis Vuitton Foundation (designed by Frank Gehry in Paris's Bois de Boulogne) has decided to focus on (5 April to 28 August 2023). And although the story has two great giants of American painting as its principal protagonists  the commercial success of their joint works appears to have been somewhat tarnished by an inevitable clash of egos. In any case  the exhibition is perhaps most of all an opportunity to witness the meeting of two artistic currents  epitomized by two artists who were very close and yet very different  surrounded by Keith Haring  Madonna and a number of other celebrities  against a backdrop of Pop  Jazz‚Ä¶ and the post-modern American Dream.What does the art market think?The works created jointly by Warhol & Basquiat have come nowhere near the record valuations generated by the two artists individually. So  while they are not without value  collectors feel that their quality does not quite equal the sum of their two parts. Although we can easily see the liberated lines of Jean-Michel-Basquiat coupled with Andy Warhol's serigraphic style  and although they apparently swapped roles and techniques  these works seem to lack the full power of Basquiat or the full bewitchment of Warhol. So  at the end of the day  their value is essentially based on their two signatures.The opinions of collectors are amply reflected in the auctions results. The auction record for a work by the Warhol/Basquiat duo is currently that hammered in 2014 for the canvas Zenith (1985) at $11.4 million at Phillips in New York. Since then  13 canvases signed by the two artists have been to auction ‚Äì several of which are currently showing at the Louis Vuitton Foundation ‚Äì without ever approaching the personal bests of the two artists (both of which are over $100 million):- Wood (1984): $2.4 million in 2016- Sweet Pungent (1984/85): $5.7 million in 2017- Taxi  45th/Broadway (c.1984/85): $9.4 million in 2018In 2022  GE/Skull (1984/85) and 1/2 Keep Frozen (1984-1985) sold for $4.6 million and $3 million respectively at Christie's in New York. However  they belonged to the collection of Thomas Ammann alongside Shot Sage Marilyn Blue (1964) by Andy Warhol  the same canvas that fetched $195 million (incl. fees) on 9 May 2022. Thomas Ammann also owned a painting by Francesco Clemente entitled The fourteen stations  No. XI (1981/82)  which generated a new record for the artist at $1.8 million (versus Christie's estimate of $80 000 - $120 000).www.christies.com/en/auction/the-collection-of-thomas-and-doris-ammann-evening-sale-29836/browse-lotsA collaboration to revive each other's careersWhen they started working together in 1984  Andy Warhol was 57 and Jean-Michel Basquiat was 24. Yet in the eyes of the market  the best of their respective productions were already behind them. Our auction data shows that the most sought-after works by Andy Warhol are those created in 1962-1964  and in the case of Jean-Michel Basquiat  the year 1982 is considered his best creative period.What historians see in this union is  at least partly  the desire of a young painter to learn from a superstar and develop his brand image  and in return  Warhol's desire to work with a rising young talent. Curiously  it seems it was the older of the two who benefited most from this collaboration since it was Warhol who experienced another prosperous year (from a career perspective) in 1986  with  among other things  the production of a series of self-portraits and several canvases around the theme of Leonardo da Vinci's Last Supper.When Andy Warhol died on 22 February 1987 he left Jean-Michel Basquiat in the grips of his demons  and a year and a half later  on 12 August 1988  Basquiat died of a drug overdose at just 27.Images:[ https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/04/image1-artmarket-artprice-Andy-Warhol-Jean-Michel-Basquiat-copyright-thierry-Ehrmann-courtesy-Organ-Museum-Abode-of-Chaos.jpg ][ https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/04/image2-artmarket-artprice-auction-turnover-per-year-Andy-Warhol-and-Jean-Michel-Basquiat.png ]Copyright 1987-2023 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to c ontact our E conometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: econometrics@artprice.comTry our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demoSubscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket.com is owned by Server Group  which is the main shareholder and founder.Artmarket.com is a global player in the Art Market with  among other structures  its Artprice department  world leader in the accumulation  management and exploitation of historical and current art market information in databanks containing over 30 million indices and auction results  covering more than 810 000 artists.Artprice Images¬Æ allows unlimited access to the largest Art Market image bank in the world: no less than 180 million digital images of photographs or engraved reproductions of artworks from 1700 to the present day  commented by our art historians.Artmarket with its Artprice department accumulates data on a permanent basis from 6500 Auction Houses and produces key Art Market information for the main press and media agencies (7 200 publications).

Rowe Price Associates  WisdomTree  Wellington Management  and Cumberland have joined an Avalanche (AVAX) subnet to test the idea of blockchain-based foreign exchange  according to an announcement from the Avalanche team. The new subnet is called ‚ÄúSpruce ‚Äù and is part of Avalanche‚Äôs Evergreen Subnet ecosystem.Following last week‚Äôs Avalanche Evergreen announcement  today marks the launch of the Spruce Subnet!Institutional partners including @TRowePrice  @WisdomTreeFunds  @Wellington_Mgmt & @CumberlandSays will use Spruce to test public blockchain applications. https://t.co/1KLzxcUCSB pic.twitter.com/xvaUmKO3BV ‚Äî Avalanche (@Avax) April 12  2023According to the announcement  institutions will initially use ‚Äúvalueless tokens‚Äù on Spruce to ensure they can conduct foreign exchange  or forex  transactions without losing capital. Interest-rate swaps will also be tested early on. Over the long run  successful tests will allow these firms to experiment with further attempts at blockchain settlement  including ‚Äúthe exploration of tokenized equity and credit issuance  trading  and fund management.‚ÄùThe announcement said that Spruce offers compliance features to help keep institutions within the parameters of the law. Firms that want to use it must first pass Know Your Customer (KYC) verifications  and once they complete this process  they receive non-transferable tokens  or NTTs  identifying them on the network. Their wallet addresses are also whitelisted ‚Äúat the chain level‚Äù after verification.Will Peck  head of digital assets at WisdomTree  said that he believes Spruce will be an important step in bringing greater efficiency to traditional financial transactions:‚ÄúWe believe tokenization and blockchain will play an important role in financial services going forward. Avalanche Spruce provides an opportunity to further explore the potential efficiencies and benefits of on-chain trading and settlement with other financial institutions. We are looking forward to experimenting in this EVM-based testing environment.‚ÄùOn April 6  Avalanche announced the launch of the ‚ÄúEvergreen‚Äù subnet protocol  which allows institutions to create customized blockchains with compliance features. At the time  a representative from Ava Labs said these subnets were needed because previous solutions  such as Corda and Hyperledger  were not interoperable enough for the needs of large institutions.Related: Deutsche Boerse  Swisscom Settle Securities with Corda and HyperledgerSpruce is one of two Avalanche Evergreen subnets launched since the protocol was released and listed on the Avalanche website. Intain  an Evergreen subnet focused on structured finance  is the other.A January joint study from Uniswap and Circle argued that the cost of forex could be reduced by as much as 80% by putting transactions on a blockchain network.

April 2023 ‚Äì At a joint meeting of the Management Board of publity AG (Scale  ISIN DE0006972508  ""publity"") with the Management Boards of PREOS Global Office Real Estate & Technology AG (""PREOS"") and GORE German Office Real Estate AG (""GORE"") today  the Management Boards of PREOS and GORE decided not to pursue the capital increases in kind resolved by the Extraordinary General Meetings of PREOS and GORE on 9. and 8 June 2022  respectively  by extension resolution of the ordinary shareholders' meetings of 8 and 7 December 2022  respectively  not to proceed with the capital increases against contribution in kind. Thus  the originally planned inclusion of a Luxembourg investor as a new major shareholder of PREOS and the related acquisition of a real estate portfolio in Luxembourg by GORE will not be implemented. The decision was made because the Luxembourg investor has not given a binding commitment to complete the transaction due to the legal disputes conducted by shareholders of PREOS and GORE against the implementation of the capital increases in kind. Currently  legal challenges against the resolutions of the PREOS and GORE shareholders' meetings of June and December 2022 are still pending and  after fruitless discussions with the plaintiffs against the resolutions  the Management Board does not expect that these proceedings will be concluded by the expiry of the extended deadlines for the registration of the implementation of the respective capital increase against contribution in kind on June 7 and 8  2023  respectively. As a result of the decision  the Group companies PREOS and GORE can now actively push alternative growth and development prospects.End of Inside InformationInformation and Explanation of the Issuer to this announcement:Information and explanations of the issuer to this announcement: EXPLANATORY SECTION About publity publity AG ('publity') is an asset manager and investor specializing in office real estate in Germany.

In conjunction with other services  lockers can transform a location into a community hub that provides consumers with an essential destination  reducing the distance travelled and journeys taken by both couriers and consumers and contributing to a more sustainable future.‚ÄúHosting carrier-agnostic lockers is another value-added service we can offer to our customers ‚Äù said Kim Challis  Regional Managing Director  APCOA UK&I. ‚ÄúWe have invested heavily in using technology to help our customers and their communities  from convenient booking and payment systems to installing EV charging points. We are also rolling out ‚Äòurban mobility hubs‚Äô that turn existing parking locations into distribution and logistics centres for greener  more efficient last-mile deliveries. These lockers will help our customers make fewer journeys  reducing their fuel use and costs while helping create a more sustainable environment.‚ÄùAccording to Rontec‚Äôs spokesperson: ‚ÄúWe want our forecourts to offer everything our customers might need. Enabling people to pick up parcels while refuelling will cut the number of journeys they need to make. Not only will this make drivers‚Äô lives easier  but it will also help reduce traffic on nearby roads  easing congestion and lowering emissions in our local communities.‚ÄùThe new partnerships represent a major milestone in Quadient‚Äôs goal of rolling out 5 000 open locker locations across the UK. The 24/7 Open Locker Network represents a new era of convenience for users: allowing consumers to pick up  send and return parcels at a time that suits them. Three major carriers ‚Äì DHL  DPD UK and Evri ‚Äì have already signed up to use the locker network  with a fourth carrier soon to be announced. The lockers‚Äô in-built label printers mean users can easily send returns or other parcels without needing to have a pre-printed label or access to a printer at home. And their robust  modular and secure construction means lockers can be placed almost anywhere  indoor or outdoor  in any configuration  while giving complete confidence that parcels will not be damaged or stolen.‚ÄúThese partnerships mark a bold step towards meeting our open locker network expansion goals ‚Äù said Ian Caminsky  SVP & MD Parcel Locker Solutions DACHIT-UKI  Quadient. ‚ÄúOur parcel locker solutions provide benefits at all levels: from the hosts who are opening up new revenue streams through fees and increased footfall  and to carriers who can reach more customers more efficiently with fewer stops  to consumers who can send and receive parcels securely at their own convenience  and to local communities that see lower traffic. We are looking forward to helping these hosts realise the full benefits of being part of our open locker network  and continuing to expand our footprint with more carriers and location partners.‚ÄùFor more information about Parcel Pending by Quadient  visit parcelpending.com/uk.About Quadient¬ÆQuadient is the driving force behind the world‚Äôs most meaningful customer experiences.

(the ""Company"" or ""Valour"") (NEO: DEFI) (GR: MB9) (OTC: DEFTF)  a technology holding company and the first and only publicly traded company that ...","Valour launches its EU-wide offering of physically backed Exchange Traded Products on digital assets (ETPs) including white-label solutions for asset managers and family offices.Total AUM rose by $70 million in 2023 reaching a record high of almost $148 million - an increase of close to 90% year-to-date.TORONTO  April 12  2023 /PRNewswire/ - Valour Inc. (the ""Company"" or ""Valour"") (NEO: DEFI) (GR: MB9) (OTC: DEFTF)  a technology holding company and the first and only publicly traded company that bridges the gap between traditional capital markets  Web3 and decentralized finance  is pleased to announce the launch of a new EU-wide issuance platform for physically stored digital assets in the form of exchange-traded product (ETP) securities.Valour Inc. Logo (CNW Group/DeFi Technologies  Inc.)On April 5  2023  Valour Digital Securities Limited (""VDSL"")  a Jersey-based securities issuer  obtained all regulatory approvals by the Swedish and Jersey regulators for an EU-wide offering to investors domiciled in Austria  Belgium  Croatia  Czech Republic  Denmark  Finland  France  Germany  Hungary  Ireland  Italy  Liechtenstein  Luxembourg  the Netherlands  Norway  Malta  Poland  Portugal  Romania  Slovakia and Spain.The new ETP products will be listed on regulated stock exchanges such as Deutsche B√∂rse/Xetra in Frankfurt  Euronext in Paris and Amsterdam and SIX Swiss Exchange in Switzerland. The new ETP program adds to Valour's already existing digital assets securities program  particularly focusing on the Nordic markets and covering a broad range of over 120 crypto currencies and digital assets in form of single underlyings  baskets or indices. Subject to the ultimate assessment by the tax authorities  investments in the new ETP products by private investors domiciled in Germany most likely should not qualify as taxable capital gains if the investment period exceeds one year. Hence  there should be no German tax withholding obligation with respect to the ETPs. VDSL aims to issue up to 15 new products under the name ""1Valour"" by the end of 2023.Story continuesThe new ETP program is designed to attract institutional investors - such as corporates  pension funds  insurances  asset managers and family offices  providing them with a wide selection of secured digital asset securities that are aligned with internal and external investment guidelines and restrictions - as well as retail investors looking for long term holdings paired with asset security. VDSL also provides for joint ""white-label"" offerings which will allow asset managers and family offices to apply self-developed strategies and indices  satisfying the demand on their client side for certain digital asset products and exposures.The ETPs will be secured by the respective digital assets that are physically stored with regulated custody providers. The initial custodians appointed are Komainu (Jersey) Limited  regulated by the Jersey Financial Services Commission  and Copper Technologies (Switzerland) AG  registered with the Financial Services Standard Association (VQF)  a Self-Regulatory Organisation (SRO) officially recognised by the Federal Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA).Physical custody ensures that the underlying assets are stored separately from the issuer in a secure location. They are additionally secured by an independent third party acting as Trustee and pledged for the benefit of the ETP investors. This provides investors with an added layer of security and protection for their assets.In addition  VDSL has entered into contractual arrangements with well-established market players as Market Makers  Authorized Participants and Index Providers  among them being: GHCO  based in the UK  one of the fastest-growing liquidity providers specializing in exchange traded funds and a market maker on all major European exchanges; Compass Financial Technologies SA  an independent Swiss-based company focused on the design  calculation  and administration of market benchmarks and tailor-made quantitative investment strategies through its French affiliate registered as a Benchmarks Administrator under the EU Benchmarks Regulations (EU BMR); as well as Invierno AB (""Vinter"")  based in Sweden  being the benchmark administrator of the Vinter Valour benchmark family and the central recipient of input data with the ability to evaluate the integrity and accuracy of input data on a consistent basis.""The launch of the digital asset backed issuance program is a milestone in Valour's product strategy "" said Olivier Roussy Newton  CEO of Valour Inc. ""It perfectly adds to Valour's mission to offer investors a maximum level of security and facilitated access to the digital assets space. As well as further enhancing the Valour brand in Europe  the asset backed program may be especially of interest for our German investors  given its potential tax advantages.""Valour further announces that total AUM increased by $70 million in 2023  reaching a record high of almost $148 million - an increase of close to 90% since the beginning of 2023. This number includes more than $6.6 million of net new sales in its existing ETP program - 8.5% organic growth next to ordinary market recovery figures.Alongside this upcoming new issuance programme  Valour offers fully hedged digital asset ETPs with low to zero management fees  with product listings across European exchanges  banks and broker platforms. Valour's existing product range includes Valour Uniswap ( UNI )  Cardano ( ADA )  Polkadot ( DOT )  Solana ( SOL )  Avalanche ( AVAX )  Cosmos ( ATOM )  Binance ( BNB )  Enjin ( ENJ )  Bitcoin Carbon Neutral ( BTCN ) and Valour Digital Asset Basket 10 ( VDAB10 ) ETPs with low management fees.

22767,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/artmarket-com-works-co-signed-123000399.html,Artmarket.com: works co-signed by Jean-Michel Basquiat and Andy Warhol are currently showing at the Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris. Artprice takes a look at their market,While a canvas by Andy Warhol generated the art auction market's second best-ever result last year (at $195 million) and a work by Jean-Michel Basquiat...,"PARIS  April 12  2023 /PRNewswire/ -- While a canvas by Andy Warhol generated the art auction market's second best-ever result last year (at $195 million) and a work by Jean-Michel Basquiat fetched over $110 million in 2017  the prices of works jointly produced by the two artists peaked at $14 million almost nine years ago. But that value differential hasn't discouraged the Louis Vuitton Foundation from organizing a major exhibition of the works co-signed by the two most emblematic figures of the New York scene of the 1960s and 80s.Portraits of Andy Warhol and Jean-Michel Basquiat ¬©thierry Ehrmann - Courtesy Mus√©e L‚ÄôOrgane / La Demeure du Chaos ‚Äì Abode of Chaos""Veritable pillars of the art market  ranked 1st and 7th in Artprice's 2022 global ranking by annual auction turnover (all periods combined)  Andy Warhol and Jean-Michel Basquiat worked together for three years "" says thierry Ehrmann  CEO of Artmarket.com and Founder of Artprice. ""Together  they created several monumental pieces  some several meters long  but which do not always have the strength of the works they created alone. At least  that is what art auction market stats suggest"".A well-orchestrated collaborationIn 1982  gallery owner Bruno Bischofberger officially presented the young Jean-Michel Basquiat to the famous Andy Warhol. They soon began to work together  along with Italian artist Francesco Clemente  painting one after the other on the same canvases. Fruit of this triple collaboration  the work Origin of Cotton (1984) was first sold at auction in 1992 at Christie's in London for $95 700. In 2018 it sold a second time at Sotheby's for $592 000 (incl. fees). For a canvas measuring 130 by 180 cm and signed by three such prestigious artists  that price seemed almost too reasonable.www.artprice.com/artist/763353/jean-michel-&-francesco-&-andy-basquiat-&-clemente-&-warhol/painting/15326208/origin-of-cottonWithin a short time  the two American stars decide to continue the collaboration alone  eventually leading to a major New York exhibition in the fall of 1985  less than two years before Warhol's death and a little less than three years before that of Jean-Michel Basquiat. The now iconic exhibition poster features them as boxers on a yellow background  haloed with red stars. The two artists are placed at the same height but already seem to be moving slightly apart.Story continuesIt's the story of this collaboration that the Louis Vuitton Foundation (designed by Frank Gehry in Paris's Bois de Boulogne) has decided to focus on (5 April to 28 August 2023). And although the story has two great giants of American painting as its principal protagonists  the commercial success of their joint works appears to have been somewhat tarnished by an inevitable clash of egos. In any case  the exhibition is perhaps most of all an opportunity to witness the meeting of two artistic currents  epitomized by two artists who were very close and yet very different  surrounded by Keith Haring  Madonna and a number of other celebrities  against a backdrop of Pop  Jazz‚Ä¶ and the post-modern American Dream.What does the art market think?The works created jointly by Warhol & Basquiat have come nowhere near the record valuations generated by the two artists individually. So  while they are not without value  collectors feel that their quality does not quite equal the sum of their two parts. Although we can easily see the liberated lines of Jean-Michel-Basquiat coupled with Andy Warhol's serigraphic style  and although they apparently swapped roles and techniques  these works seem to lack the full power of Basquiat or the full bewitchment of Warhol. So  at the end of the day  their value is essentially based on their two signatures.The opinions of collectors are amply reflected in the auctions results. The auction record for a work by the Warhol/Basquiat duo is currently that hammered in 2014 for the canvas Zenith (1985) at $11.4 million at Phillips in New York. Since then  13 canvases signed by the two artists have been to auction ‚Äì several of which are currently showing at the Louis Vuitton Foundation ‚Äì without ever approaching the personal bests of the two artists (both of which are over $100 million):- Wood (1984): $2.4 million in 2016- Sweet Pungent (1984/85): $5.7 million in 2017- Taxi  45th/Broadway (c.1984/85): $9.4 million in 2018In 2022  GE/Skull (1984/85) and 1/2 Keep Frozen (1984-1985) sold for $4.6 million and $3 million respectively at Christie's in New York. However  they belonged to the collection of Thomas Ammann alongside Shot Sage Marilyn Blue (1964) by Andy Warhol  the same canvas that fetched $195 million (incl. fees) on 9 May 2022. Thomas Ammann also owned a painting by Francesco Clemente entitled The fourteen stations  No. XI (1981/82)  which generated a new record for the artist at $1.8 million (versus Christie's estimate of $80 000 - $120 000).www.christies.com/en/auction/the-collection-of-thomas-and-doris-ammann-evening-sale-29836/browse-lotsA collaboration to revive each other's careersWhen they started working together in 1984  Andy Warhol was 57 and Jean-Michel Basquiat was 24. Yet in the eyes of the market  the best of their respective productions were already behind them. Our auction data shows that the most sought-after works by Andy Warhol are those created in 1962-1964  and in the case of Jean-Michel Basquiat  the year 1982 is considered his best creative period.What historians see in this union is  at least partly  the desire of a young painter to learn from a superstar and develop his brand image  and in return  Warhol's desire to work with a rising young talent. Curiously  it seems it was the older of the two who benefited most from this collaboration since it was Warhol who experienced another prosperous year (from a career perspective) in 1986  with  among other things  the production of a series of self-portraits and several canvases around the theme of Leonardo da Vinci's Last Supper.When Andy Warhol died on 22 February 1987 he left Jean-Michel Basquiat in the grips of his demons  and a year and a half later  on 12 August 1988  Basquiat died of a drug overdose at just 27.Images:[https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/04/image1-artmarket-artprice-Andy-Warhol-Jean-Michel-Basquiat-copyright-thierry-Ehrmann-courtesy-Organ-Museum-Abode-of-Chaos.jpg][https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/04/image2-artmarket-artprice-auction-turnover-per-year-Andy-Warhol-and-Jean-Michel-Basquiat.png]Copyright 1987-2023 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to contact our Econometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: econometrics@artprice.comTry our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demoSubscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket.com is owned by Server Group  which is the main shareholder and founder.Artmarket.com is a global player in the Art Market with  among other structures  its Artprice department  world leader in the accumulation  management and exploitation of historical and current art market information in databanks containing over 30 million indices and auction results  covering more than 810 000 artists.Artprice Images¬Æ allows unlimited access to the largest Art Market image bank in the world: no less than 180 million digital images of photographs or engraved reproductions of artworks from 1700 to the present day  commented by our art historians.Artmarket with its Artprice department accumulates data on a permanent basis from 6500 Auction Houses and produces key Art Market information for the main press and media agencies (7 200 publications).

In conjunction with other services  lockers can transform a location into a community hub that provides consumers with an essential destination  reducing the distance travelled and journeys taken by both couriers and consumers and contributing to a more sustainable future.‚ÄúHosting carrier-agnostic lockers is another value-added service we can offer to our customers ‚Äù said Kim Challis  Regional Managing Director  APCOA UK&I. ‚ÄúWe have invested heavily in using technology to help our customers and their communities  from convenient booking and payment systems to installing EV charging points. We are also rolling out ‚Äòurban mobility hubs‚Äô that turn existing parking locations into distribution and logistics centres for greener  more efficient last-mile deliveries. These lockers will help our customers make fewer journeys  reducing their fuel use and costs while helping create a more sustainable environment.‚ÄùAccording to Rontec‚Äôs spokesperson: ‚ÄúWe want our forecourts to offer everything our customers might need. Enabling people to pick up parcels while refuelling will cut the number of journeys they need to make. Not only will this make drivers‚Äô lives easier  but it will also help reduce traffic on nearby roads  easing congestion and lowering emissions in our local communities.‚ÄùThe new partnerships represent a major milestone in Quadient‚Äôs goal of rolling out 5 000 open locker locations across the UK. The 24/7 Open Locker Network represents a new era of convenience for users: allowing consumers to pick up  send and return parcels at a time that suits them. Three major carriers ‚Äì DHL  DPD UK and Evri ‚Äì have already signed up to use the locker network  with a fourth carrier soon to be announced. The lockers‚Äô in-built label printers mean users can easily send returns or other parcels without needing to have a pre-printed label or access to a printer at home. And their robust  modular and secure construction means lockers can be placed almost anywhere  indoor or outdoor  in any configuration  while giving complete confidence that parcels will not be damaged or stolen.‚ÄúThese partnerships mark a bold step towards meeting our open locker network expansion goals ‚Äù said Ian Caminsky  SVP & MD Parcel Locker Solutions DACHIT-UKI  Quadient. ‚ÄúOur parcel locker solutions provide benefits at all levels: from the hosts who are opening up new revenue streams through fees and increased footfall  and to carriers who can reach more customers more efficiently with fewer stops  to consumers who can send and receive parcels securely at their own convenience  and to local communities that see lower traffic. We are looking forward to helping these hosts realise the full benefits of being part of our open locker network  and continuing to expand our footprint with more carriers and location partners.‚ÄùFor more information about Parcel Pending by Quadient  visit parcelpending.com/uk.About Quadient¬ÆQuadient is the driving force behind the world‚Äôs most meaningful customer experiences.

EBITDA is still negative by ‚Ç¨1M (improving by ‚Ç¨0.6M vs. 2021) but would have been close to breakeven in the second half of the year without the impact of the refinery shutdown (social movement on purchasing power).The shipment  at the end of the year  of the first Scarabox¬Æ unit to Cameroon.More generally  the Group benefited from very favourable market conditions for P2R units  with Brent rising from an average of 71$/bbl in 2021 to 99$/bbl in 2022. As gas prices were responsible for a particularly strong demand for fuel oil and gasoil  the selling prices of finished products increased even more.The group's EBITDA has thus increased from -‚Ç¨1.4M in 2021 to +‚Ç¨1.1M in 2022.Excluding Ecoslops Provence  which is in a ramp-up phase  the group's EBITDA would be +‚Ç¨2.1M in 2022 (vs. +‚Ç¨0.2M in 2021).The group's operating cash flow was +‚Ç¨2.9 million for the year. Excluding Ecoslops Provence  it is +3.7 M‚Ç¨.

However  the 2021 financial year included a reversal of provision (no longer applicable) in the amount of ‚Ç¨0.15 million. The personnel expenses have therefore remained stable between the two fiscal years.External expenses increased by ‚Ç¨1.8 million  of which ‚Ç¨1 million was attributable to Ecoslops Provence (start of production in the second half of 2021 as opposed to a full year in 2022) and ‚Ç¨0.8 million to Ecoslops Portugal  which was impacted for ‚Ç¨0.4 million by the increase in the price of electricity and by additional maintenance and transport costs on sales.Net financial result was a loss of ‚Ç¨1.3 million. This mainly comprises the interest expense on the EIB loan for ‚Ç¨1 million.The corporate income tax represents an income of ‚Ç¨0.4 million and is composed of a tax income of ‚Ç¨0.4 million related to the research tax credit  the recognition of deferred tax assets in Portugal for an amount of ‚Ç¨0.2 million and a current tax charge in Portugal of ‚Ç¨0.2 million.Consolidated balance sheet at December 31  2022(Based on audited accounts  reports in progress)In ‚Ç¨'000 FY 2022 FY 2021 Var. k‚Ç¨ Var. % Intangible assets 1 117 1 441 (324) (22)% Tangible assets 33 182 34 342 (1 160) (3)% Financial assets 783 180 603 +335% Fixed assets 35 082 35 963 (881) (2)% Inventory 1 314 1 510 (196) (13)% Trade receivables 4 049 5 090 (1 041) (20)% Other receivables 1 713 1 721 (9) (0)% Deferred tax asset 1 527 1 348 179 +13% Cash and cash equivalent 6 870 6 340 530 +8% Prepaid expenses 869 1 036 (168) (16)% Current assets 16 341 17 045 (704) 24% Total Assets 51 423 53 008 (1 585) (3)% FY 2022 FY 2021 Var. k‚Ç¨ Var. % Capital & Reserves 16 014 19 734 (3 720) (19)% Investing subsidy 1 460 1 556 (96) (6)% Minority shareholders (77) 590 (667) (113)% Net result - Part for the Group (1 793) (3 720) 1 927 (52)% Equity 15 604 18 160 (2 556) (14)% Conditional advance 838 0 838 N/A Prov. for Risks & Charges 96 180 (84) (47)% Financial debt 29 211 28 952 259 1% Trade payables 3 995 4 113 (118) (3)% Social and tax liabilities 1 029 1 053 (24) (2)% Other payables 650 550 100 +18% Current liabilities 5 674 5 716 (42) (1)% Total Liability & Equity 51 423 53 008 (1 585) (3)%Financial position and cash flowsAs of December 31  2022  the Group had nearly ‚Ç¨6.9 million in cash (+‚Ç¨0.5 million compared to December 31  2021) and net debt of ‚Ç¨23.2 million (vs. ‚Ç¨22.6 million as of December 31  2021).

Ecoslops' objective is to build a portfolio of customers worldwide for its units  allowing it to generate revenues throughout the life of the project: sale of the Scarabox  multi-year technical assistance  dividends as a shareholder.In the very short term  Parlym will take  alongside Ecoslops  a minority stake in Valtech Energy in Cameroon (first customer of the Scarabox¬Æ). The two partners also aim to make a second investment in 2023 in Ivory Coast  as soon as the regulatory approvals have been granted.Ecoslops' objective is to set up at least one unit per year under this agreement. Parlym brings its historical presence on the African continent  the securing of project financing and its expertise in project management. Ecoslops brings its know-how and technology in waste recovery  as well as its commercial partnerships.Ecoslops aims to sell at least one more unit per year in the short term in different territories not covered by this agreement and to develop other such partnerships around the world.As a result  the Ecoslops group has chosen to focus its technical and financial resources on the most profitable activities  those that generate the most cash flow in the short term and promise growth in the medium term. This is why it has been decided to:- Develop more rapidly and in partnership the sales of Scarabox  generating quick cash flow and margins;- Focus efforts on cash flow generation for Ecoslops Provence and Portugal P2Rs;- Move from a manufacturer/funder/operator model to a model of licensing its technology and know-how for new P2Rs.As the Antwerp and Singapore projects have the characteristic of requiring long development times (several years)  high financing requirements and long payback periods  it was decided to focus the group's resources on existing assets and no longer on these projects  in view of the fact that the return on investment is too distant for Ecoslops.In Egypt  the request of Ecoslops for a fixed contribution from each vessel to secure the revenues of the project (environmental tax) was not endorsed by the authorities  and this project has become too risky in terms of business model (commercial risk on the turnover to be carried by Ecoslops). It is useful to recall that the study costs were covered by the funding in the form of a FASEP grant.ESGAs a player in circular economy  Ecoslops places major importance on environmental issues  in addition to societal and governance issues. In this context  the Group published its third sustainability report on May 30  2022.The Group's commitment to continuous improvement was illustrated in 2022 by the new rise in its ESG rating resulting from the Ga√Øa Research 2021 campaign. The company thus confirmed its performance as a gold medallist  ranked 39th/371 in the general panel (compared to 170th/390th in the previous campaign)  and 14th/126 in the panel of companies with revenues of less than ‚Ç¨150 million.Perspectives for 2023In 2023  for the Sines unit in Portugal  the company expects a production of around 25 000 tons for the year.For the Marseille unit  after a beginning of 2023 penalised by a maintenance phase  and then by the impossibility of restarting due to the social movement impacting French refineries (pension reform)  the initial objective of producing 15 000 tonnes over the year has been revised downwards to 11 000 tonnes for these conjunctural reasons.Finally  Ecoslops aims to contract the sale of a new Scarabox in Ivory Coast this year.*: EBITDA = Earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization.Financial Agenda:Combined General Meeting: June 13  2023Publication of first-half 2023 revenues: July 12  2023Publication of half-yearly results: September 26  2023ABOUT ECOSLOPSEcoslops is listed on Euronext Growth in ParisISIN code: FR0011490648 - Mnemonic: ALESA / PEA-PME eligible.Investor Relations Contact : info.esa@ecoslops.com - +33 (0)1 83 64 47 43Ecoslops is the cleantech that brings oil into circular economy  by upgrading oil residues into new fuels and light bitumen.

There has been considerable uptake in recent years  particularly on the consumer-facing side of digitized processes  Yalich argues  although some retailers continue to be inhibited by concerns over the legality and enforceability of electronically signed documents as secure assets.That perception extends to questioning how electronically signed documents are stored and managed in a way that ensures they retain the same legal enforceability as paper ‚Äî via eVaults ‚Äî and understanding what elements are essential in using eVaults to ensure that level of enforceability. The insights feature in a recently published article  ‚ÄúWhy All eVaults are Not Created Equal ‚Äù in AutoSuccessOnline.com.Considering the number of eVault platforms available now  it‚Äôs no longer enough to just store everything electronically in an eVault  he contends. Yet it is critical for lenders to incorporate an eAsset management capability to properly store and manage one‚Äôs financial assets ‚Äúin a way that supports originators  warehouse lenders  custodians and investors  along with servicers to close  manage and monetize digital assets.‚Äù‚ÄúToday‚Äôs leading solutions are purpose-built to deliver digital asset certainty  which is the assurance that digital loans are created  stored and assigned in full accordance with all compliance standards for the industry  while maintaining the highest level of legal enforceability throughout a digital loan‚Äôs lifecycle ‚Äù Yalich writes.He notes that eAsset management of financial assets requires much more than the ‚Äúsecure storage‚Äù elements of an eVault  namely  encryption  tamper evidence  access controls and access logs. eAsset management also includes the ability to assign and transfer control over a financial asset with a tamper-sealed registry of the history of control.Yalich is bullish on industry efforts that complement lenders‚Äô increasing digitization of back-end functionality with consumer-facing processes  but he says a fully compliant  contactless digital loan experience requires these critical components.‚ÄúWith the adoption of this technology  auto lenders and their dealership partners will ensure they are providing the efficient experience that consumers want today  while also remaining in compliance with new and evolving regulations built for a digital economy ‚Äù he adds.About Wolters KluwerWolters Kluwer (EURONEXT: WKL) is a global leader in information  software  and services for professionals in healthcare  tax and accounting  financial and corporate compliance  legal and regulatory  and corporate performance and ESG.

In addition  during the first half of the year our revenues were impacted by the global shortage of semiconductor chips. Meteor Inkjet‚Äôs revenue fell short of projections by more than ¬£4 million during this period. Their team quickly redesigned a critical circuit board using a chip that was more widely available  but the lost first-half revenue was not fully recovered in 2022. I‚Äôm pleased to say that 2023 has started very strongly for Meteor  with revenues recovering to healthy levels and demand from China increasing rapidly.‚ÄúDespite all the challenges  we completed two strategic acquisitions  sold an old and unused intangible asset for net ‚Ç¨3.3 million  achieved four new patents  and drew the constituent parts of the business closer together into one company  reorganising R&D resources and pushing ahead with product innovation to the benefit of our customers. There‚Äôs no doubt that Hybrid Software Group has emerged from 2022 as a stronger company. We have best-in-class technology  a sound business plan focussed on markets that are trending upwards  and strong cash position of Euros 6.3 million.‚ÄùExecutive Chairman Guido Van der Schueren adds  ‚Äú2022 was a year of mixed results and we fell short of our growth projections in both revenue and net profit. We acted quickly in response  taking prudent steps to conserve cash and reduce our cost structure  especially external spending. But we never sacrificed the long-term value of Hybrid Software Group. We did not cut any of our key personnel or reduce R&D spending  and if anything  we stepped up our sales efforts and increased the company‚Äôs presence at key trade shows and industry events. We have broadened our potential customer reach by offering successful products for all digital printing applications and I anticipate a much higher level of growth and profitability in the very near future.‚ÄùFinancial highlightsFor the year ended 31 December In thousands of euros 2022 2021 Continuing operations Revenue 46 693 48 562 Operating profit 2 274 4 770 Profit before tax 1 835 4 565 Tax (charge)/credit (535) 349 Profit from continuing operations 1 300 4 914 EBITDA - continuing operations 10 895 12 211 Adjusted operating profit - continuing operations 2 106 7 308 Adjusted net profit - continuing operations 945 6 390 Basic earnings per share (euro) - continuing operations 0.04 0.15 Adjusted earnings per share (euro) - continuing operations 0.03 0.20 Available cash 6 317 9 234The consolidated pre-tax result for continuing operations was ‚Ç¨1.84 million compared with a profit of ‚Ç¨4.57 million in 2021. The decrease in profitability of ‚Ç¨2.73 million was due to:a decrease in revenue of ‚Ç¨1.87 million;a decrease in cost of sales of ‚Ç¨1.09 million;an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses of ‚Ç¨4.38 million;an increase in research and development expenses of ‚Ç¨0.78 million;a decrease in other operating expenses of ‚Ç¨0.18 million;an increase in other income of ‚Ç¨3.27 million;an increase in net finance expenses of ‚Ç¨0.79 million; anda decrease in foreign exchange losses of ‚Ç¨0.55 million.Revenue for the Printing Software segment was ‚Ç¨15.26 million for the year (2021: ‚Ç¨13.84 million).Revenue for the Printhead Solutions segment was ‚Ç¨8.66 million for the year (2021: ‚Ç¨13.98 million). This segment was severely impacted by the shortage of its most commonly used chip until a critical circuit board was redesigned using a different component in mid-2022.Revenue for the Enterprise Software segment was ‚Ç¨22.78 million for the year (2021: ‚Ç¨20.74 million).Gross profit for the period increased to 84.2% of revenue (2021: 82.5%)  primarily due to the higher mix ofsoftware related sales during the year  particularly higher margin sales to end users by HYBRID Software.Included in selling  general and administrative expenses is amortisation of ‚Ç¨1.17 million (2021: ‚Ç¨0.84 million)related to intangible assets recognised as a result of acquisitions.Research and development expenses includes the capitalisation and amortisation of internally generated intangible assets and the amortisation of certain intangible assets recognised as a result of acquisitions. During the period there was a net capitalisation of development expenditure of ‚Ç¨2.00 million (2021: ‚Ç¨2.39 million) and amortisation of acquired intangible assets of ‚Ç¨5.10 million (2021: ‚Ç¨3.93 million).The net capitalisation of development expenditure comprised ‚Ç¨4.0 million (2021: ‚Ç¨3.40 million) of capitalised expenditure less ‚Ç¨2.0 million (2021: ‚Ç¨1.01 million) of amortisation.The third quarter results were favourably impacted by the sale of an unused asset (approximately 69 000 IPv4 internet addresses) for a net amount of ‚Ç¨3.3 million which closed in July. Given the nature of the sale this income is reported as ‚ÄúOther Income‚Äù and is not included in our revenue figures  but it is accretive to EBITDA.Total operating expenses increased by ‚Ç¨4.98 million  or 14.1% compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase was mainly due to higher sales & marketing related expenditures  increased amortization expenses and higher staff cost resulting from the acquisitions of ColorLogic and Hybrid Iberia in Q4 2021  and iC3D in Q1 2022.Foreign exchange gains and losses were primarily due to the revaluation of currency balances held at the balance sheet date and the change in exchange rates during the year.The Company presents EBITDA (earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortisation) and adjusted profit when reporting its financial results to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate the Group‚Äôs results in a manner that focuses on what the Group believes to be its underlying business operations. The Group‚Äôs management believes that the inclusion of adjusted financial results provides consistency and comparability with past reports.Additional commentary and analysis of the Company‚Äôs consolidated results for the year ending 31 December 2022 can be found in the annual report and financial statements.Should you wish to receive a printed copy of the annual report  please send an e-mail to investor-relations@hybridsoftware.group or make your request in writing  for the attention of the Company‚Äôs Chief Financial Officer  to 2030 Cambourne Business Park  Cambourne  Cambridge  CB23 6DW  UK.Annual General MeetingThe Company will hold its annual general meeting on Wednesday 24 May 2023.

The AAN Annual Meeting is the world‚Äôs premier neurology meeting  attracting over 10 000 neurology professionals from around the globe.The title of this presentation is ‚ÄòMasitinib Shows Prolonged Survival in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) Patients with Mild or Moderate Disease Severity at Baseline‚Äô. The abstract will be published in an online supplement to the journal Neurology.Included in this presentation are the long-term survival data that showed a significantly prolonged survival of 25 months in favor of masitinib for patients with non-severe disease severity at baseline. Furthermore  new analyses performed for the regulatory authorities have shown that starting masitinib treatment in ALS patients prior to any complete loss of physical function (corresponding to a score of 0 on each ALSFRS-R individual component) resulted in a significant treatment-effect across multiple endpoints at week 48  including the joint rank analysis of function and survival (CAFS)  which is a key regulatory endpoint.Of note  this latter population includes all patients regardless of baseline progression rate and encompasses about 80% of the overall AB10015 study population. Moreover  exclusion of patients with a complete loss of function is justified in the context of treating neurodegenerative disease  any improvement in lost function being beyond what can be reasonably expected from an interventional drug  no matter how effective it may be in preventing further progression.Professor Olivier Hermine  MD  PhD (President of the Scientific Committee of AB Science and member of the Acad√©mie des Sciences in France) said  ‚ÄúOnce a clinical study has met its primary objective  it is methodologically acceptable to identify populations that enrich benefit-risk. Furthermore  retrospective analyses based on overall survival are also acceptable  as this is a highly robust endpoint. Beyond the already known increased long-term survival data from patients with moderate ALS severity [2]  masitinib has now been shown to produce a significant treatment-effect on the key regulatory accepted outcome of CAFS  provided that treatment starts prior to any complete loss of physical functionality.‚ÄùProfessor Albert Ludolph commented that  ‚ÄúThese results  including long-term survival data  suggest that masitinib can produce a significant treatment-effect provided that treatment starts early in the disease course of ALS and more importantly prior to any complete loss of physical function. This observation is consistent with mechanistic evidence that masitinib conserves neuro-muscular function as opposed to repairing existing neurological damage. Hence  the current confirmatory phase 3 study (AB19001) is well-aligned with the ALS patient population that is expected to derive greatest benefit from masitinib.‚ÄùAs a reminder  the development program of masitinib in ALS comprises a 48-week clinical trial (AB10015)  including long-term survival follow-up analysis  and an on-going confirmatory phase 3 trial (AB19001). Study AB10015 previously showed that masitinib (4.5 mg/kg/day) as an add-on to standard riluzole  significantly slowed functional decline at week 48 in patients with an ALSFRS-R progression rate of less than 1.1 points/month at baseline  relative to those treated with riluzole alone [1]. Furthermore  long-term follow-up analysis of this population showed a significantly prolonged survival of 25 months for masitinib treated patients that had moderate ALS at baseline [2]. The development of masitinib in ALS is also supported by a well-demonstrated mechanism of action using a relevant model [3‚Äì7].References[1] Mora JS  Genge A  Chio A  et al.

Published 2016 Jul 11.About amyotrophic lateral sclerosisAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal motor neuron disorder that is characterized by progressive loss of the upper and lower motor neurons at the spinal or bulbar level. The disease belongs to a group of disorders known as motor neuron diseases  which are characterized by the gradual degeneration and death of motor neurons. In ALS  both the upper motor neurons and the lower motor neurons degenerate or die  and stop sending messages to muscles. The prevalence of ALS in western countries is fairly uniform at 6 per 100 000 persons  corresponding to around 30 000 cases in Europe and 20 000 in the USA. The first drug treatment for ALS  riluzole (Rilutek)  was approved in 1995. In Europe  there has been no new treatment approved since riluzole.About masitinibMasitinib is an orally administered tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets mast cells and macrophages  important cells for immunity  through inhibiting a limited number of kinases. Based on its unique mechanism of action  masitinib can be developed in a large number of conditions in oncology  in inflammatory diseases  and in certain diseases of the central nervous system. In oncology due to its immunotherapy effect  masitinib can have an effect on survival  alone or in combination with chemotherapy. Through its activity on mast cells and microglia and consequently the inhibition of the activation of the inflammatory process  masitinib can have an effect on the symptoms associated with some inflammatory and central nervous system diseases and the degeneration of these diseases.About AB ScienceFounded in 2001  AB Science is a pharmaceutical company specializing in the research  development and commercialization of protein kinase inhibitors (PKIs)  a class of targeted proteins whose action are key in signaling pathways within cells. Our programs target only diseases with high unmet medical needs  often lethal with short term survival or rare or refractory to previous line of treatment. AB Science has developed a proprietary portfolio of molecules and the Company‚Äôs lead compound  masitinib  has already been registered for veterinary medicine and is developed in human medicine in oncology  neurological diseases  inflammatory diseases and viral diseases.

(the ""Company"" or ""Valour"") (NEO: DEFI) (GR: MB9) (OTC: DEFTF)  a technology holding company and the first and only publicly traded company that bridges the gap between traditional capital markets  Web3 and decentralized finance  is pleased to announce the launch of a new EU-wide issuance platform for physically stored digital assets in the form of exchange-traded product (ETP) securities.On April 5  2023  Valour Digital Securities Limited (""VDSL"")  a Jersey-based securities issuer  obtained all regulatory approvals by the Swedish and Jersey regulators for an EU-wide offering to investors domiciled in Austria  Belgium  Croatia  Czech Republic  Denmark  Finland  France  Germany  Hungary  Ireland  Italy  Liechtenstein  Luxembourg  the Netherlands  Norway  Malta  Poland  Portugal  Romania  Slovakia and Spain.The new ETP products will be listed on regulated stock exchanges such as Deutsche B√∂rse/Xetra in Frankfurt  Euronext in Paris and Amsterdam and SIX Swiss Exchange in Switzerland. The new ETP program adds to Valour's already existing digital assets securities program  particularly focusing on the Nordic markets and covering a broad range of over 120 crypto currencies and digital assets in form of single underlyings  baskets or indices. Subject to the ultimate assessment by the tax authorities  investments in the new ETP products by private investors domiciled in Germany most likely should not qualify as taxable capital gains if the investment period exceeds one year. Hence  there should be no German tax withholding obligation with respect to the ETPs. VDSL aims to issue up to 15 new products under the name ""1Valour"" by the end of 2023.The new ETP program is designed to attract institutional investors - such as corporates  pension funds  insurances  asset managers and family offices  providing them with a wide selection of secured digital asset securities that are aligned with internal and external investment guidelines and restrictions - as well as retail investors looking for long term holdings paired with asset security. VDSL also provides for joint ""white-label"" offerings which will allow asset managers and family offices to apply self-developed strategies and indices  satisfying the demand on their client side for certain digital asset products and exposures.The ETPs will be secured by the respective digital assets that are physically stored with regulated custody providers. The initial custodians appointed are Komainu (Jersey) Limited  regulated by the Jersey Financial Services Commission  and Copper Technologies (Switzerland) AG  registered with the Financial Services Standard Association (VQF)  a Self-Regulatory Organisation (SRO) officially recognised by the Federal Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA).Physical custody ensures that the underlying assets are stored separately from the issuer in a secure location. They are additionally secured by an independent third party acting as Trustee and pledged for the benefit of the ETP investors. This provides investors with an added layer of security and protection for their assets.In addition  VDSL has entered into contractual arrangements with well-established market players as Market Makers  Authorized Participants and Index Providers  among them being: GHCO  based in the UK  one of the fastest-growing liquidity providers specializing in exchange traded funds and a market maker on all major European exchanges; Compass Financial Technologies SA  an independent Swiss-based company focused on the design  calculation  and administration of market benchmarks and tailor-made quantitative investment strategies through its French affiliate registered as a Benchmarks Administrator under the EU Benchmarks Regulations (EU BMR); as well as Invierno AB (""Vinter"")  based in Sweden  being the benchmark administrator of the Vinter Valour benchmark family and the central recipient of input data with the ability to evaluate the integrity and accuracy of input data on a consistent basis.""The launch of the digital asset backed issuance program is a milestone in Valour's product strategy "" said Olivier Roussy Newton  CEO of Valour Inc. ""It perfectly adds to Valour's mission to offer investors a maximum level of security and facilitated access to the digital assets space. As well as further enhancing the Valour brand in Europe  the asset backed program may be especially of interest for our German investors  given its potential tax advantages.""Valour further announces that total AUM increased by $70 million in 2023  reaching a record high of almost $148 million - an increase of close to 90% since the beginning of 2023. This number includes more than $6.6 million of net new sales in its existing ETP program - 8.5% organic growth next to ordinary market recovery figures.Alongside this upcoming new issuance programme  Valour offers fully hedged digital asset ETPs with low to zero management fees  with product listings across European exchanges  banks and broker platforms. Valour's existing product range includes Valour Uniswap ( UNI )  Cardano ( ADA )  Polkadot ( DOT )  Solana ( SOL )  Avalanche ( AVAX )  Cosmos ( ATOM )  Binance ( BNB )  Enjin ( ENJ )  Bitcoin Carbon Neutral ( BTCN ) and Valour Digital Asset Basket 10 ( VDAB10 ) ETPs with low management fees. Valour's flagship products are Bitcoin Zero and Ethereum Zero  the first fully hedged  passive investment products with Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) as underlyings which are completely fee free.About ValourValour Inc.

The initial positive results of the Phase I/II clinical trial of Batten-1  with the demonstration of a good tolerability  safety and pharmacokinetic profile  enable us to plan the Phase III registration study involving a pediatric cohort during 2023. The company has also formed strategic alliances with leading partners to identify novel targets and advanced therapy drug candidates. These growth opportunities enable Theranexus to strengthen its market position in rare neurological diseases "" Theranexus CEO  Mathieu Charv√©riat explains.2022 annual financial results (French GAAP)‚Ç¨K 2022 2021 Turnover - - Operating income 1 246 25 Other purchases and external charges 3 967 5 591 Wages and social security charges 3 165 2 689 Amortization and depreciation of fixed assets 332 1 204 Other operating expenses 39 53 Operating expenses 7 503 9 537 Net operating income/(expenses) (6 257) (9 512) Net financial income/(expense) (158) (396) Non-recurring expenses (771) - Income tax 619 1 758 Net income/(expense) (6 567) (8 150)The 2022 full-year results were approved by the company's Board of Directors on 12 April 2023 and were the subject of a report by the company's Statutory Auditors.In 2022  operating income particularly benefited from grants awarded in relation to the Neurolead research platform  totaling ‚Ç¨1 246 K.Other purchases and external charges declined in 2022 (‚Ç¨3 967 K) compared to 2021 (‚Ç¨5 591 K) owing to substantial regulatory preclinical expenses incurred for Batten-1 in 2021  which were partly offset by the new Phase I/II clinical trial for Batten disease in 2022.Wages and social security charges recorded a moderate increase with ‚Ç¨3 165 K in 2022 compared to ‚Ç¨2 689 K in 2021.Amortization and depreciation costs for 2022 were ‚Ç¨332 K. Non-recurring expenses stand at -‚Ç¨771 K due to the removal of legacy patents. Write-back on depreciation of fixed assets for ‚Ç¨771 K was also recorded.Income tax stands at ‚Ç¨619 K in 2022 compared to ‚Ç¨1 758 K in 2021. This reduction is mainly explained by the fact that the Company's clinical expenses for 2022 related to its Phase I/II Batten-1 trial in the U.S. and are therefore not eligible for the Research Tax Credit (CIR). Conversely  in 2021  the Company incurred significant expenses eligible for CIR  most notably regulatory preclinical expenses for its Batten disease candidate development.Cash position as of 31 March 2023On 31 March 2023  total available funds stood at ‚Ç¨7.3 M in line with the company's forecasts; this was achieved through careful management and secures at least 12 months' visibility.Highlights of 2022 and Q1 2023Strategic focus on rare neurological diseases and new milestone in company organizationIn April 2022  Theranexus opted to focus on rare neurological diseases to concentrate R&D on its Batten-1 drug candidate for Batten disease and identification of novel advanced therapy active substances. In January 2023  to drive forward these next phases of its development  changes were made to the company's organization with the appointment of Mathieu Charv√©riat as CEO and Franck Mouthon as Executive Chairman.Following its new strategic direction  the Company gave several scientific and business presentations in 2022 and early 2023 such as at the fUSbrain conference (June 2022)  the BIO business convention (June 2022)  the Federation of European Neurosciences Societies (FENS) Forum (July 2022)  the Batten Disease Support and Research Association (BDSRA) conference (July 2022) and the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference (January 2023).New advances to the Batten-1 programIn 2022  in partnership with BBDF  Theranexus pursued the development of its Batten-1 drug candidate in juvenile Batten disease  for which it holds an exclusive  global license for development and commercial use. In early 2023  Theranexus and BBDF achieved an important milestone with the announcement of positive results in their Batten-1 program in the Phase I/II clinical trial  with the demonstration of good patient safety and tolerability and a pharmacokinetic profile in line with expectations. These results enable Theranexus and the Foundation to prepare for the Phase III trial paving the way to Batten-1 approval. The partners plan to initiate this clinical trial involving a pediatric cohort by the end of 2023.During the past year  Theranexus and its scientific partners Marco Sardiello of Baylor College of Medicine (Houston  USA) and Emyr Lloyd-Evans of Cardiff University (UK) presented their research at two major conferences for the community of researchers specialized in lysosomal diseases ‚Äì Translational Research Conference for the Management of NCLS (Chicago  USA ‚Äì November 2022) and WORLDSymposium (Orlando  USA ‚Äì February 2023). During these events  for the first time the partners shared data demonstrating the fundamental role of glycosphingolipid accumulation in the pathophysiology of the disease  as well as the potent effect of miglustat on reducing this accumulation and resulting neuronal death.New strategic alliances for identifying novel targets and advanced therapy drug candidates in rare neurological diseasesIn Q4 2022  Theranexus signed a strategic alliance with Inserm Transfert  the value creation subsidiary of the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research (Inserm). With this new agreement  Theranexus benefits from preferential early access to Inserm research for identifying and characterizing novel targets and RNA or antisense oligonucleotide candidates to treat patients with rare neurological diseases.In a similar vein  in early 2023 Theranexus and its partners Inria  Claude Bernard Lyon 1 University and Hospices Civils de Lyon announced the launch of a joint public-private research project team called AlstroSight to develop innovative digital methods in a bid to identify novel targets and drug candidates designed to treat brain diseases.These alliances are perfectly in line with Theranexus' development strategy and fuel the company's strong ambition to consolidate its positioning and portfolio in rare neurological diseases.About TheranexusTheranexus is an innovative biopharmaceutical company that emerged from the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA). It specializes in the treatment of central nervous system disorders and is a pioneer in the development of drug candidates targeting both neurons and glial cells.The company has a unique platform for the identification and characterization of advanced therapy drug candidates targeting rare neurological disorders and an initial drug candidate in clinical development for Batten disease.Theranexus is listed on the Euronext Growth market in Paris (FR0013286259- ALTHX).More information at http://www.theranexus.comClick and follow us on Twitter and LinkedlnContactsTHERANEXUSThierry LambertChief Financial Officercontact@theranexus.comNEWCAPTh√©o Martin/Pierre LaurentInvestor Relations+33 (0)1 44 71 94 97theranexus@newcap.euFP2COMFlorence PortejoieMedia Relations+ 33 (0)6 07 76 82 83fportejoie@fp2com.frDisclaimerThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements concerning Theranexus and its business  including its prospects and product candidate development.

Despite this  production guidance for the year remains unchanged  albeit towards the bottom end of guidance for ilmenite and rutile.The market for ilmenite stabilised in Q1 2023  with evidence of spot price increases in recent weeks supported by recovering Chinese pigment demand. While received prices are lower than the peaks achieved in 2022  they nevertheless remain near all-time highs.‚ÄùOverviewLost Time Injury Frequency Rate (‚ÄúLTIFR‚Äù) of 0.15 per 200 000 hours worked on a 12-month rolling basis (Q1 2022: 0.00); 1.3 million LTI-free hours achieved by end March 2023Heavy Mineral Concentrate (‚ÄúHMC‚Äù) production decreased 18% in Q1 2023 to 315 000 tonnes (Q1 2022: 384 700 tonnes)  heavily impacted by the lightning strike and lower recoveriesIlmenite production decreased 20% in Q1 2023 to 204 300 tonnes (Q1 2022: 256 800) and primary zircon production decreased 12% to 11 400 tonnes (Q1 2022: 12 900 tonnes) due primarily to lower HMC availabilityRutile production decreased 15% to 1 700 tonnes (Q1 2022: 2 000 tonnes)  in line with lower HMC consumptionConcentrates production decreased 6% to 10 100 tonnes (Q1 2022: 10 700 tonnes) benefitting from the processing of stockpilesTotal shipments of finished products increased 17% in Q1 2023 to 271 700 tonnes (Q1 2022: 231 500 tonnes)  benefitting from increased transshipment capacity and availability of ocean-going vesselsThe market for ilmenite stabilised in Q1 2023  at lower levels than Q4 2022  with evidence of spot price increases in recent weeksKenmare reiterates 2023 production guidance for all products  with ilmenite and rutile expected to be towards the bottom end of the guidance rangeOperations updateOperational results from the Moma Mine in Q1 2023 were as follows:Q1 2023 Q1 2022 Variance Q4 2022 Variance tonnes tonnes % tonnes % Excavated ore1 9 258 000 9 391 000 -1% 10 145 000 -9% Grade1 4.13% 4.49% -8% 4.75% -13% Production HMC production 315 000 384 700 -18% 404 000 -22% HMC processed 314 800 373 300 -16% 397 900 -21% Ilmenite 204 300 256 800 -20% 283 900 -28% Primary zircon 11 400 12 900 -12% 14 600 -22% Rutile 1 700 2 000 -15% 2 200 -23% Concentrates2 10 100 10 700 -6% 11 700 -14% Shipments 271 700 231 500 17% 365 700 -26%1. Excavated ore and grade prior to any floor losses.2. Concentrates include secondary zircon and mineral sands concentrate.The end of Q1 2023 saw a Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (‚ÄúLTIFR‚Äù) of 0.15 per 200 000 hours worked on a 12-month rolling basis (Q1 2022: 0.00)  with two lost time injuries recorded during the quarter. 1.3 million LTI-free hours were achieved by the end of March 2023.HMC production was 315 000 tonnes in Q1 2023  representing an 18% decrease compared to Q1 2022 (384 700 tonnes). Mining operations were impacted by the previously disclosed severe lightning incident in Q1 2023  impacting HMC production. Though lower than expected  excavated ore tonnes only decreased 1% to 9 258 000 tonnes compared to Q1 2022 (9 391 000 tonnes)  despite the lightning strike. Recoveries were impacted by higher slimes levels in Q1 2023 at WCP A compared to Q1 2022. Seasonal power interruptions  including those related to the lightning strike  also affected mining recoveries.Production of HMC was further impacted by an 8% decrease in ore grades to 4.13% in Q1 2023 (Q1 2022: 4.49%). Ore grades are expected to normalise at ~4.2% for the remainder of 2023.Production of ilmenite  Kenmare‚Äôs primary product  decreased by 20% to 204 300 tonnes in Q1 2023 (Q1 2022: 256 800 tonnes)  due primarily to the 16% reduction in HMC processed and lower recoveries  though partially offset by a build in intermediate stockpiles. Primary zircon production decreased by 12% to 11 400 tonnes (Q1 2022: 12 900 tonnes)  which was also impacted by the reduced HMC processed  but supported by higher zircon contained in the HMC.Rutile production was down 15% in Q1 2023 to 1 700 tonnes (Q1 2022: 2 000 tonnes) in line with lower HMC processed. Concentrates production decreased by only 6% to 10 100 tonnes (Q1 2022: 10 700 tonnes)  with drawdown of intermediate stockpiles partially offsetting lower HMC processed.Shipments increased by 17% in Q1 2023 to 271 700 tonnes (Q1 2022: 231 500 tonnes)  comprising 259 000 tonnes of ilmenite  8 600 tonnes of primary zircon and 4 200 tonnes of concentrates. A further large ilmenite shipment  partially-loaded at the end of the quarter  will be included in Q2 2023 figures.Closing stock of HMC at the end of Q1 2023 was 19 000 tonnes  compared with 18 800 tonnes at year-end 2022. Closing stock of finished products at the end of Q1 2023 was 169 300 tonnes (Q4 2022: 213 500 tonnes)  reflecting the drawdown of finished product stocks in Q1 2023.Capital projectsFurther updates will be provided at the Capital Markets Day on 26 April 2023.Market updateKenmare continued to see robust demand for all products in Q1 2023. However  received prices of ilmenite decreased quarter-on-quarter  because of weaker demand for pigment in Q4 2022.The global pigment market remained weak as destocking of inventories only halted in early 2023 and underlying demand was impacted by higher interest rates. However  chloride pigment production in China rebounded strongly in Q1 2023 and demand from the titanium metal sector continued to increase  supporting demand for Kenmare‚Äôs ilmenite.Despite increased supply from domestic ilmenite producers and Chinese concentrate producers operating in Mozambique  spot ilmenite prices in China have increased in recent weeks  benefitting from stronger pigment production.Customer enquiries for ilmenite shipments in Q2 2023 have also risen with pigment demand  while demand for ilmenite beneficiation remains strong.Demand for zircon weakened in H2 2022 and this continued in Q1 2023; while the Chinese market has remained subdued  India has continued to show strong demand growth.Zircon prices remained stable in Q1 2023 benefitting from lower supply  due to production issues in Australia and South Africa. Kenmare continues to receive strong demand for its zircon products in Q2 2023.For further information  please contact:Kenmare Resources plcJeremy Dibb / Michael StarkeInvestor Relationsir@kenmareresources.comTel: +353 1 671 0411Mob: +353 87 943 036Murray (PR advisor)Paul O‚ÄôKane / Andrew Smithpokane@murraygroup.ie / asmith@murraygroup.ieTel: +353 1 498 0300Mob: +353 86 609 0221 / +353 83 076 5717About Kenmare ResourcesKenmare Resources plc is one of the world's largest producers of mineral sands products.

At least  that is what art auction market stats suggest‚Äù.A well-orchestrated collaborationIn 1982  gallery owner Bruno Bischofberger officially presented the young Jean-Michel Basquiat to the famous Andy Warhol. They soon began to work together  along with Italian artist Francesco Clemente  painting one after the other on the same canvases. Fruit of this triple collaboration  the work Origin of Cotton (1984) was first sold at auction in 1992 at Christie's in London for $95 700. In 2018 it sold a second time at Sotheby's for $592 000 (incl. fees). For a canvas measuring 130 by 180 cm and signed by three such prestigious artists  that price seemed almost too reasonable.www.artprice.com/artist/763353/jean-michel-&-francesco-&-andy-basquiat-&-clemente-&-warhol/painting/15326208/origin-of-cottonWithin a short time  the two American stars decide to continue the collaboration alone  eventually leading to a major New York exhibition in the fall of 1985  less than two years before Warhol's death and a little less than three years before that of Jean-Michel Basquiat. The now iconic exhibition poster features them as boxers on a yellow background  haloed with red stars. The two artists are placed at the same height but already seem to be moving slightly apart.It's the story of this collaboration that the Louis Vuitton Foundation (designed by Frank Gehry in Paris's Bois de Boulogne) has decided to focus on (5 April to 28 August 2023). And although the story has two great giants of American painting as its principal protagonists  the commercial success of their joint works appears to have been somewhat tarnished by an inevitable clash of egos. In any case  the exhibition is perhaps most of all an opportunity to witness the meeting of two artistic currents  epitomized by two artists who were very close and yet very different  surrounded by Keith Haring  Madonna and a number of other celebrities  against a backdrop of Pop  Jazz‚Ä¶ and the post-modern American Dream.What does the art market think?The works created jointly by Warhol & Basquiat have come nowhere near the record valuations generated by the two artists individually. So  while they are not without value  collectors feel that their quality does not quite equal the sum of their two parts. Although we can easily see the liberated lines of Jean-Michel-Basquiat coupled with Andy Warhol's serigraphic style  and although they apparently swapped roles and techniques  these works seem to lack the full power of Basquiat or the full bewitchment of Warhol. So  at the end of the day  their value is essentially based on their two signatures.The opinions of collectors are amply reflected in the auctions results. The auction record for a work by the Warhol/Basquiat duo is currently that hammered in 2014 for the canvas Zenith (1985) at $11.4 million at Phillips in New York. Since then  13 canvases signed by the two artists have been to auction ‚Äì several of which are currently showing at the Louis Vuitton Foundation ‚Äì without ever approaching the personal bests of the two artists (both of which are over $100 million):- Wood (1984): $2.4 million in 2016- Sweet Pungent (1984/85): $5.7 million in 2017- Taxi  45th/Broadway (c.1984/85): $9.4 million in 2018In 2022  GE/Skull (1984/85) and 1/2 Keep Frozen (1984-1985) sold for $4.6 million and $3 million respectively at Christie's in New York. However  they belonged to the collection of Thomas Ammann alongside Shot Sage Marilyn Blue (1964) by Andy Warhol  the same canvas that fetched $195 million (incl. fees) on 9 May 2022. Thomas Ammann also owned a painting by Francesco Clemente entitled The fourteen stations  No. XI (1981/82)  which generated a new record for the artist at $1.8 million (versus Christie's estimate of $80 000 - $120 000).www.christies.com/en/auction/the-collection-of-thomas-and-doris-ammann-evening-sale-29836/browse-lotsA collaboration to revive each other's careersWhen they started working together in 1984  Andy Warhol was 57 and Jean-Michel Basquiat was 24. Yet in the eyes of the market  the best of their respective productions were already behind them. Our auction data shows that the most sought-after works by Andy Warhol are those created in 1962-1964  and in the case of Jean-Michel Basquiat  the year 1982 is considered his best creative period.What historians see in this union is  at least partly  the desire of a young painter to learn from a superstar and develop his brand image  and in return  Warhol's desire to work with a rising young talent. Curiously  it seems it was the older of the two who benefited most from this collaboration since it was Warhol who experienced another prosperous year (from a career perspective) in 1986  with  among other things  the production of a series of self-portraits and several canvases around the theme of Leonardo da Vinci's Last Supper.When Andy Warhol died on 22 February 1987 he left Jean-Michel Basquiat in the grips of his demons  and a year and a half later  on 12 August 1988  Basquiat died of a drug overdose at just 27.Images:[ https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/04/image1-artmarket-artprice-Andy-Warhol-Jean-Michel-Basquiat-copyright-thierry-Ehrmann-courtesy-Organ-Museum-Abode-of-Chaos.jpg ][ https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/04/image2-artmarket-artprice-auction-turnover-per-year-Andy-Warhol-and-Jean-Michel-Basquiat.png ]Copyright 1987-2023 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to c ontact our E conometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: econometrics@artprice.comTry our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demoSubscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket.com is owned by Server Group  which is the main shareholder and founder.Artmarket.com is a global player in the Art Market with  among other structures  its Artprice department  world leader in the accumulation  management and exploitation of historical and current art market information in databanks containing over 30 million indices and auction results  covering more than 810 000 artists.Artprice Images¬Æ allows unlimited access to the largest Art Market image bank in the world: no less than 180 million digital images of photographs or engraved reproductions of artworks from 1700 to the present day  commented by our art historians.Artmarket with its Artprice department accumulates data on a permanent basis from 6500 Auction Houses and produces key Art Market information for the main press and media agencies (7 200 publications).

As one of the largest owners and operators of affordable and mid-market multifamily apartments in Ireland  IRES is a platform that can be a significant provider of housing stock in Ireland. Moreover  IRES' current corporate structure as a publicly-traded REIT has many inefficiencies (outlined herein) that hinder it from being a more relevant and viable entity to contribute  in particular  to new and economically viable developments to address the severe housing shortage in Dublin. Vision believes that there exists a distinct and significant opportunity for Ireland should IRES cease to be a public company and continue to operate privately with a different corporate and capital structure  which would have the corresponding benefit of value creation for IRES and its shareholders. Notably  the inefficiencies in IRES' structure  which include several factors  have resulted in the market price of the REIT's ordinary shares trading at a significant discount to the market value of the real estate it owns and its operating platform.As discussed more fully herein  Vision has been an IRES shareholder since 2014 and has been actively engaged with IRES since July 2021. Vision has been in active dialogue with IRES' board of directors (the ""Board"") and has been continually misled  cajoled  and stymied in our efforts. Vision is concerned that the IRES Board and management (""Management"") are choosing not to address fundamental structural issues  while at the same time benefiting greatly and disproportionately from the Company's compensation structure  which disincentivizes them from pursuing the required structural changes.It is evident that fundamental change is necessary  and necessary now.On this basis  Vision will be voting against the election of the following directors at the 2023 AGM:Resolution 2a- Declan Moylan   Current Executive Chairman  Current Executive Chairman Resolution 2c- Brian Fagan   Current Chief Financial Officer  Current Chief Financial Officer Resolution 2d- Joan Garahy   Remuneration Committee Member  Remuneration Committee Member Resolution 2g- Tom Kavanagh   Remuneration Committee MemberVision will also be voting against the following resolutions:Resolution 6- Advisory resolution on the Report of the Remuneration Committee on Directors' RemunerationResolution 8a- Authority to disapply pre-emption rights in specified circumstancesResolution 8b - Authority to disapply pre-emption rights for an acquisition or other specified capital investmentVision notes that resolutions equivalent to Resolutions 8a and 8b were rejected by shareholders at the 2022 Annual General Meeting (the ""2022 AGM""). Nevertheless  the Board included them for consideration by the shareholders at the 2023 AGM without indicating in the meeting materials that these resolutions failed to be approved last year.Vision asks that other shareholders vote against Resolutions 2a  2c  2d  2g  6  8a  and 8b in order to communicate to the IRES Board their dissatisfaction for the reasons set out herein.Vision sets forth below our thoughts and observations regarding the need for a fundamental and structural change at IRES and the steps that we are taking in an effort for the IRES Board to address the concerns that we have been expressing privately for several years.Background:The Vision Opportunity Funds (the ""Vision Funds"")  investment funds managed by Vision (further background information on Vision is available at www.visioncap.ca)  with assets under management as at March 31st  2023 of more than $900 million  have been long-standing active and supportive shareholders of IRES. The Vision Funds initially invested in IRES' ordinary shares (""Ordinary Shares"") at the time of the REIT's initial public offering in 2014  added to this investment over the years and have held the Ordinary Shares as a core portfolio holding for much of the last nine years. Our portfolio team has also visited Ireland and toured IRES' property portfolio extensively on three separate occasions.We have actively engaged with the REIT's Management and Board members on multiple occasions and  beginning in July 2021  expressed to them the concerns that are set out in this letter. The initial communication in July 2021 set forth Vision's thoughts and observations and the need for fundamental change at IRES  requesting that the Board formally resolve  and publicly announce its intention  to explore value-maximizing transactions for the benefit of all IRES shareholders and retain financial advisors to do so  given the current market value of the Ordinary Shares at the time did not reflect the market value of the REIT's portfolio and its platform. After eight months with no changes being initiated  Vision subsequently corresponded with the Chairman of the Board in March 2022  during which Vision proposed adding several resolutions to the agenda of the REIT's 2022 AGM for shareholder approval with respect to a formal sales process for the Company. At the strong request of the Chairman  these resolutions were ultimately held in abeyance and withdrawn due to the Chairman's expressed commitment to bona fide actions to address Vision's detailed concerns. Vision agreed to stand down at the time based on the understanding that the Company was to consider a strong  shareholder-aligned candidate as a new non-executive member of the IRES Board and would provide an update to the market no later than the published results in the summer of 2022 on all options and activities in relation to the Board addressing the concerns that Vision had been expressing since July 2021. Notwithstanding the Chairman's commitment  which Vision relied upon  such an update was never provided  whether to Vision or to IRES shareholders more generally. When Vision enquired with the Chairman as to why this commitment was breached  we were told that the Board had concluded its review and determined that the status quo was the most appropriate course of action  therefore there was no reason to make any announcements when there was no change contemplated. In addition  Vision had expectations that certain Director candidates with experience and alignment to better serve the interests of IRES shareholders would be advanced; unfortunately  the Board ultimately appointed an additional Director who was not satisfactory to Vision in this regard.At the request of the Board  we  in the past  have stepped back from making a public announcement expressing our concerns on the promise that matters would be addressed. With this not having occurred  we now feel compelled to be public with our concerns and take this step of corresponding directly with IRES shareholders by way of this letter.The Vision team has deep experience and significant knowledge garnered over more than 35 years in the realm of real estate and publicly-traded securities. Over the past nine years  Vision has done extensive work on IRES and its markets. It is increasingly evident that the status quo is not sustainable and is leading to value erosion for IRES shareholders  while the remuneration of insiders is increasing. We believe that now is the time to communicate publicly to the IRES Board that enough is enough  and change is needed.We are hopeful that Canadian Apartment Properties REIT (""CAPREIT"")  which is the holder of approximately 18.7% of the Ordinary Shares  will support Vision in pursuing the much-needed change. CAPREIT's involvement since it conceived and sponsored the creation of IRES and its very significant shareholding place it in a unique position from a capital markets perspective. While a large shareholder  its involvement as the manager of the REIT was terminated in 2022  and (unfortunately  in our view) its President and CEO Mark Kenney also resigned from the IRES Board in 2021. Since CAPREIT is not typically a passive minority owner of real estate that it does not manage  its ownership position in IRES is an overhang on the market price of the Ordinary Shares. In addition  its large ownership stake may serve as a deterrent to potential acquirers of the Ordinary Shares and/or the entity itself. Although the IRES interest may not comprise a significant portion of CAPREIT's asset base  we urge CAPREIT to consider its shareholding both to serve the financial interests of CAPREIT's unitholders and IRES minority shareholders and in the broader context of ESG considerations as well as its corporate reputation. CAPREIT sponsored the creation of IRES and solicited and encouraged the support of many investors  including Vision  to join it as a shareholder of IRES.While the destruction of value and structural impediments detailed herein may be inconsequential to CAPREIT  Vision believes it has a corporate responsibility to consider the interests of minority shareholders  particularly in the context of CAPREIT's sponsorship and the history of IRES. Of importance  by supporting the initiatives addressed herein  CAPREIT also can aid in changing the course of IRES to an entity that can more effectively and significantly contribute to solutions to address the severe housing shortage in Ireland. In light of CAPREIT's unique position  without its active engagement  minority shareholders are left with a ""Catch 22"" situation where CAPREIT ownership is on one hand a market overhang and on the other hand  its passive laissez-fair approach enables the continuation of a failed entity  missed opportunity and the ongoing erosion of shareholder value.Discounted Valuation:It has been readily apparent that the Ordinary Shares have traded  and continue to trade  at a significant discount to the underlying net asset value (""NAV"") of the REIT's real estate holdings and the enterprise as a whole. Evidence of this disconnect in valuations can be seen in the REIT's most recently reported EPRA NDV NAV of ‚Ç¨1.677 per share  with the REIT's Ordinary Share price of ‚Ç¨0.94 on April 11th  2023  trading at an approximately 44% discount to the REIT's own assessment of value as reported in IRES year-end Financial Statements published on February 24th  2023.In addition  the implied value of its real estate on a price per-unit basis based on its market trading price has consistently depicted a valuation well below the sale price on a per-unit basis of comparable multifamily apartment transactions for several years. Further  while there have not been many recent transactions  select recent transactions that have been consummated underscore this  including a March 2023 report of Pontegadea acquiring the 120-unit Opus at Six Hanover Quay in Dublin for just over ‚Ç¨100 million. While the Opus at Six Hanover Quay targets a higher market segment than the average IRES apartment unit  the ‚Ç¨842 000 per suite price point is noteworthy in that it is greater than the highest reported price point in 2022 of ‚Ç¨741 000 per unit and greater than the average transaction price in 2022 of ‚Ç¨454 000 per suite  thus reflecting apparent investor appetite to still acquire assets at compelling valuations. In addition  the sale was estimated to have occurred at a 4.25% net initial yield  according to React News. The REIT's shares  on the other hand  currently trade at an implied yield that is approximately 135 basis points greater than the Pontegadea transaction and imply an average price of ‚Ç¨295 000 per suite which is approximately 35% below the average price per suite of transactions that occurred in 2022.It is also apparent that the implied stock market trading price per unit of approximately ‚Ç¨295 000 per suite is at least 30% to 40% below the replacement cost valuation of creating new apartments in Dublin  which are estimated to be in excess of ‚Ç¨460 000 per unit. In fact  a new report shows construction costs for apartments in this market increased by approximately 10% in 2022. This is particularly relevant when the vacancy rate for apartments in Dublin is approximately 1.2%  according to EY Ireland and GeoDirectory Residential Buildings Report for Q4 2022  and the development of new affordable and market housing is the only solution that can help alleviate the market's severe housing shortage.As another relevant replacement cost metric  we would note that IRES acquired its Tara View site on Merrion Road for ‚Ç¨47.1 million (including VAT but excluding other transaction costs) in August 2022 to complete its forward purchase agreement of a new development. As this property includes 69 residential units  the purchase price indicates a valuation of ‚Ç¨683 000 per unit. At its current share price of ‚Ç¨0.94  indicating a value per unit of ‚Ç¨295 000  IRES' Ordinary Shares are trading at an approximate 57% discount to this replacement cost valuation.None of the above-noted valuation metrics ascribe any value to IRES' operating and management platform overseeing the largest portfolio of multifamily apartments in Ireland  nor its unique position to contribute to and benefit from the returns of the new development of apartments.Capital Market Inefficiencies and ChallengesVision believes the discounted valuation of the REIT's Ordinary Shares is in part attributable to the following inefficiencies of IRES as a publicly-listed REIT:Flaws of the REIT structure and mismatch to serve the housing shortage in Ireland :To qualify as a REIT  pursuant to Irish tax regulation  the REIT is required to distribute to shareholders at least 85% of the Property Income of its Property Rental Business for each accounting period. As such  by distributing such a large proportion of its cash flow annually to its shareholders  it does not retain sufficient cash flow to grow and  in particular  fund new developments and contribute new supply to help alleviate the housing shortage. This ongoing short-term withdrawal of capital does not promote nor enable prudent longer-term investment decisions and opportunities. Moreover  this high dividend payout makes IRES vulnerable to reliance on capital markets  which are extremely inefficient as outlined herein.Trading Liquidity:Even though IRES has been an established public REIT for over nine years  the average daily trading volume of the Ordinary Shares remains exceedingly low  both on an absolute basis and relative to its market capitalization. Moreover  published trading volumes overstate actual trading volume. This reflects ""double printing"" by investment dealers whereby they record both the purchase and sale of any one trade. Accordingly  the estimated average daily trading volume of the Ordinary Shares over the past year is approximately 423 000. We would note that this is a de minimis 0.1% of the total Ordinary Shares outstanding.This illiquidity represents a disservice to all IRES shareholders  presenting challenges to the efficient purchase and sale of the Ordinary Shares  as it limits the number and breadth of investors (including smaller investors who can execute smaller trades but may determine that the overall general illiquidity is a deterrent to the prospective investment) and fosters a persistent undervaluation of the Ordinary Shares.Equity Financing Options:The more limited options to raise equity capital for Irish-listed securities results in comparatively inefficient and expensive solutions relative to  for example  North American listed securities.In other global equity capital markets  a wider array of equity financing options is frequently employed. Some examples include ""Forward Sale"" agreements in the United States  ""Bought Deals"" in Canada  and ""At the Market"" or ""ATM"" regular course financings. The less flexible Irish equity capital markets limit the opportunity to maximize shareholder value.The requirement for an EU approved prospectus for new equity issuances presents a cumbersome  costly  time-consuming  and relatively inefficient burden when IRES chooses to issue equity.We would also note that IRES has historically had a relatively poor track record of effectively raising equity capital.Limited Investor Universe:As a smaller capital market  the Irish public markets contain a smaller pool of institutional and retail investors that may be receptive to purchasing the Ordinary Shares. This contributes to reduced demand for the Ordinary Shares on a day-to-day basis and an imbalance of market power when IRES seeks to raise equity capital in a new issue offering  which manifests itself in an excessive and unnecessarily dilutive discount from recent market trading prices to execute a new offering of Ordinary Shares. It is noteworthy that the Irish REIT market never flourished as it was hoped it would when legislation was passed in 2013 and has  to the contrary  contracted with the privatization of Green REIT and Hibernia REIT  as well as the sale of Yew Grove REIT. A dedicated investor base has never emerged and  as a result  European investors have not been incentivized to focus on Irish REITs as they became a very small part of core European benchmarks.Constraints and Limitations for Profitable Growth:A fundamental rationale for any entity to be publicly-listed is to enable expedited and profitable growth by increasing access to capital-raising opportunities and expanding the investor base.Dublin and other Irish property markets generally present limited growth opportunities for a REIT focused on Ireland. Moreover  at this juncture  IRES already has the leading market share position.As a publicly-traded company listed on the Euronext Dublin exchange and solely focused on the Irish market  employing lower financial leverage relative to its non-publicly traded peers  IRES is currently positioned to be either less competitive or less profitable than well-funded private owners or a larger public company or REIT listed on another exchange that benefits from scale  a wider investment universe and a lower cost of capital.In addition  the collective challenges emanating from the valuation and capital markets constraints and practicalities  summarized herein  dictate that raising additional equity capital to fund growth through acquisition and/or development would require issuing new Ordinary Shares well below the REIT's net asset value (as previously detailed)  and would therefore be highly dilutive for current shareholders.In summary  it is apparent that at this juncture  IRES cannot effectively and profitably grow as a publicly listed entity. As a result  a course correction is warranted and necessary.Inefficient Structure but Much-Needed PlatformWhile Vision believes IRES as a publicly-traded REIT is an inappropriate structure  we recognize the important market need and opportunity the REIT is failing to address and its great potential to be a more effective part of the solution in solving the housing crisis in Ireland.To this point  the availability of rental accommodations in Ireland remains excessively low  with Daft.ie (one of Ireland's leading property websites) estimating there are only 1 100 homes listed as available to rent nationwide as of February 2023  down from over 23 400 homes fourteen years ago. Furthermore  this low availability is likely to persist for the next few years. According to the government's ""Housing for All ‚Äì a New Housing Plan for Ireland "" it is estimated that Ireland will need an average of 33 000 new homes to be provided each year from 2021 to 2030. This goal is not likely to be met over the near term as  based on the Central Bank of Ireland's most recent Quarterly Bulletin  it is estimated that housing completions totaled 29 000 in 2022  with forecasts showing only 27 000 and 29 500 houses will be developed in 2023 and 2024  respectively.As such  we believe that IRES  as one of the largest and most experienced residential operators should continue to aid in this effort. However  with the REIT currently unable to raise additional non-dilutive equity capital  as previously detailed  the Company is likely to limit its investment activities and will be unable to be a material source of capital for the creation of housing in Ireland. Underscoring this limitation  IRES recently decided to walk away from developing its long-touted premier development site known as Rockbrook  which was expected to deliver 428 residential units in a core transit-connected Dublin market. Management has acknowledged  and it is evident that  the significant discount in the market trading price of the Ordinary Shares relative to the net asset value per share of the REIT's owned real estate makes it economically unattractive to advance this development.Remuneration of Board and ManagementVision is concerned that IRES Management and its Board are choosing not to address the fundamental issue of Board and Management remuneration with the Company while at the same time benefiting greatly and disproportionately from the Company's compensation structure  which disincentivizes them from pursuing the required structural changes. In addition  Vision is concerned with two recent amendments to the compensation structure that were enacted by the Remuneration Committee (the ""Committee""):In 2022  the Committee proposed to change the REIT's current long-term incentive compensation from the current performance based LTIP structure to Restricted Share Units (""RSUs""). Vision believes this would have been detrimental to the REIT as RSUs implicitly reduce Management's alignment with the Company and its shareholders. In fact  according to IRES  other shareholders had also questioned whether this form of long-term incentive is appropriately aligned with the shareholder experience. The mere suggestion of this change demonstrates that the Committee is not aligned with shareholder interests.Further evidence of this misalignment can be seen from the Committee's alterations of the 2023 LTIP structure: the benchmark on which the TSR (Total Shareholder Return) component is based has been changed from the original benchmark to a narrower subset that focuses on residential REITs. While Vision acknowledges that the new benchmark could be more comparable to IRES  Vision finds it suspect that the Committee has decided to change the benchmark in 2023 rather than in prior years and believes that the reason for the change is to set an easier target for Management to attain. The Committee has not provided any assurance that the benchmark will be kept the same going forward  and in fact  has informed investors that it will be consulting again this year on a revised proposal for a new remuneration policy.In March 2023   the Committee decided to increase Chief Financial Officer (""CFO"") Brian Fagan's salary and maximum bonus opportunity for this year despite the poor performance and execution over the past two years and in opposition to Vision's expressed concerns. Mr. Fagan was only recently hired by IRES in April 2021 as Finance Director and then appointed CFO in April 2022 . There has been no material change in his responsibilities. The internalization of the REIT management was being negotiated by the REIT and was known to both IRES and to Mr. Fagan at the time of his employment commencement in 2021.A key duty of the CFO acting on behalf of Management and the Board is to prudently manage the REITs balance sheet. It is evident that the market trading price of IRES' Ordinary Shares was acutely and negatively impacted due to the mismanagement of the Company's balance sheet. IRES took excessive risk by maintaining an unnecessary amount of floating rate debt and inexplicably did not hedge this debt against interest rate movements until December 2022   despite going through perhaps the most telegraphed interest rate hiking cycle in history. The increase in the CFO's compensation is egregious  as not only has Mr. Fagan's role not materially changed since his recent hire  but IRES' performance in this specific area has been poor if not reckless. Of additional concern is the appointment of Mr. Fagan to the Board. The intertwined entitlements of this Board and Management as reflected in the ""you scratch my back; I scratch your back actions"" are increasingly egregious.Misalignment of Board and Management InterestsVision expressed concern over two years ago that the total ownership of the collective members of the Board was extremely low  which suggested that the Board had little  if any  alignment with IRES shareholders. As at December 31st  2022  this fact had not changed  as the Board members owned just 0.99 million shares representing approximately 0.22% of the total Ordinary Shares.For the same period  the Vision Funds collectively owned over 25 million Ordinary Shares representing approximately 5.0% of IRES' Ordinary Shares. As such  Vision  as just one shareholder of IRES holds more than 25 times the amount of shares of the 9 Directors of IRES combined.On several occasions over the past two years  after Vision raised substantive concerns on various matters including the limited ownership of Ordinary Shares by the Board  the Chairman  Mr. Declan Moylan informed Vision that the Board would seriously consider the matters Vision raised. A subsequent and typical response was that its practices were consistent with other public comparable companies. Often the Board's failure to respond constructively to serve shareholder interests was cloaked behind ""hired gun"" professional advisors skilled in maintaining the self-serving interests of entrenched boards  all funded at the expense of shareholders.Shareholders should not accept comparisons to other companies in other markets used to obfuscate and deflect the issues at hand including those addressed herein  to enable continued Board entrenchment. A highly aligned  committed  and effective Board should consider the specific circumstances of IRES as an entity  its financial circumstance  the specific needs  requirements and opportunities in Ireland and the structural and practical flaws and inefficiencies that it faces in its marketplace.The 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code and the Irish Corporate Governance Annex suggest best governance practice is that Mr. Moylan's tenure as Chairman should cease after nine years. However  IRES has recently decided to extend his term for a tenth year on the premise that there has been significant change at the Board that warrants this extension. Mr. Moylan and the Board had at least two years to plan for and accommodate these changes. Perhaps his failure to do so should be considered as another reason to terminate his role as Chairman to comply with the nine year rule rather than an excuse to extend it.Shareholders continue to suffer  and IRES fails to contribute effectively or efficiently to the housing shortage in Ireland  while an extraordinarily entrenched Board enriches and serves itself from the public company trough. This misalignment must be addressed.The IRES Board must listen to the shareholdersIn 2022  Vision requested that the IRES Board put forth a resolution to the 2022 annual general meeting to initiate a process to advance and execute value maximization opportunities for the Company. At IRES' urging and advancement of expectations for change  Vision withdrew the request.In addition to the matters to be considered and voted upon by shareholders at the currently scheduled Annual General Meeting on May 4th  2023  Vision intends to proceed to requisition an extraordinary general meeting to consider the resolutions it withdrew in 2022. The resolutions  if approved  would require IRES to commence a bona fide process to execute a value-maximizing transaction for the REIT.Unfortunately  due to the settlement structure of shares listed on Euronext Dublin and the requirements of the Irish Companies Act  Vision is required to transfer the Ordinary Shares currently held in nominee accounts for the benefit of the Vision Funds to a direct registration in the names of the Vision Funds on the books of the registrar to effect the shareholder meeting requisition. Hence  unless IRES agrees to amend the 2023 AGM Agenda and proxy materials to better serve shareholder interests and avoid the unnecessary and duplicate costs of two meetings  a shareholder meeting to vote on the resolution to pursue a process to optimize value for IRES shareholders will be delayed to a date after the May 4th  2023 Annual General Meeting.In the interim  shareholders can communicate their desire for change by voting against resolutions 2a  2c  2d  2g  6  8a  and 8b at the 2023 AGM as discussed below.To reiterate  Vision will be voting against the election of the following directors at the 2023 AGM:Resolution 2a- Declan Moylan   Current Executive Chairman  Current Executive Chairman Resolution 2c- Brian Fagan   Current Chief Financial Officer  Current Chief Financial Officer Resolution 2d- Joan Garahy   Remuneration Committee Member  Remuneration Committee Member Resolution 2g- Tom Kavanagh   Remuneration Committee MemberTo reiterate further  Vision will also be voting against the following resolutions at the 2023 AGM:Resolution 6- Advisory resolution on the Report of the Remuneration Committee on Directors' RemunerationResolution 8a- Authority to disapply pre-emption rights in specified circumstancesResolution 8b - Authority to disapply pre-emption rights for an acquisition or other specified capital investmentIt is important to note that Resolutions 8a and 8b were overwhelmingly rejected by shareholders at the 2022 Annual General Meeting. Nevertheless  the arrogant entrenchment of this Board has resulted in the same resolutions being included by them for consideration by the shareholders at the 2023 AGM without indicating in the meeting materials that these resolutions failed to be approved last year. Particularly for the reasons noted above  any issuance of Ordinary Shares by IRES would be extremely dilutive to all shareholders and should proceed only after each shareholder has an opportunity to participate in such share offering pro rata. Without this rejection  this entrenched Board could tactically choose to issue new equity to a select group of existing or prospective shareholders that may further entrench their position and exclude other shareholders at their will. This is a key factor as to why these resolutions were rejected by shareholders last year and that is why Vision will vote against these resolutions at the 2023 AGM.Vision asks that shareholders complete their proxies or otherwise vote at the 2023 AGM in the same way that Vision is with respect to Resolutions 2a  2c  2d  2g  6  8a  and 8b.We would ask any IRES shareholder who shares our concerns or has any questions  to reach out to us at info@visioncap.ca with your telephone contact information and we will be pleased to further discuss this matter with you.We believe that together we can make a great change that will benefit Ireland  while at the same time maximizing value for all IRES shareholders. We hope that you will vote in the manner that we are  as a first and important step to making this happen.Yours trulyVISION CAPITAL CORPORATIONPhoto - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2052130/Vision_Capital_Corporation_Vision_Capital_Corporation_Issues_Ope.jpginfo@visioncap.caSOURCE Vision Capital Corporation",neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,mixed,0.07,0.1,0.83,True,English,"['upcoming IRES 2023 Annual General Meeting', 'Vision Capital Corporation Issues', 'other IRES shareholders', 'other matters', 'Open Letter', 'directors', 'same', 'upcoming May 4th, 2023 Annual General Meeting', 'Irish Residential Properties REIT plc', 'Current Chief Financial Officer Resolution', 'Current Executive Chairman Resolution', '2022 Annual General Meeting', 'Remuneration Committee Member Resolution', 'Remuneration Committee Member Vision', 'The Vision Opportunity Funds', 'other specified capital investment', 'Irish housing market', 'mid-market multifamily apartments', '2d- Joan Garahy', 'further background information', 'severe housing shortage', 'core portfolio holding', 'current corporate structure', 'economically viable developments', 'three separate occasions', 'initial public offering', 'last nine years', 'The Vision Funds', 'Vision Capital Corporation', 'Resolution 8a- Authority', 'fundamental structural issues', '25 million ordinary shares', ""IRES' property portfolio"", 'meeting materials', 'capital structure', 'investment funds', 'significant opportunity', 'housing stock', 'portfolio team', 'Advisory resolution', 'viable entity', 'different corporate', 'multiple occasions', 'initial communication', 'other shareholders', 'market price', 'market value', 'structural changes', ""Directors' Remuneration"", 'compensation structure', 'significant shareholder', 'critical needs', 'largest owners', 'significant provider', 'corresponding benefit', 'value creation', 'several factors', 'significant discount', 'real estate', 'fundamental change', 'Declan Moylan', 'Brian Fagan', 'Tom Kavanagh', 'pre-emption rights', 'several years', 'public company', 'Board members', ""IRES' structure"", 'ineffective platform', 'operating platform', 'Vision Logo', 'open letter', 'many inefficiencies', 'active dialogue', 'same time', 'IRES shareholder', 'supportive shareholders', 'following resolutions', ""IRES' board"", 'IRES Board', 'DUBLIN', 'Ireland', 'April', 'affiliates', 'concerns', 'light', '2023 AGM', 'interests', 'operators', 'affordable', 'relevant', 'new', 'distinct', 'July', 'efforts', 'management', 'basis', 'election', 'Report', 'circumstances', 'acquisition', '2022 AGM', 'consideration', 'order', 'dissatisfaction', 'reasons', 'thoughts', 'observations', 'steps', 'visioncap', 'assets', 'March']",2023-04-12,2023-04-13,prnewswire.co.uk

EBITDA is still negative by ‚Ç¨1M (improving by ‚Ç¨0.6M vs. 2021) but would have been close to breakeven in the second half of the year without the impact of the refinery shutdown (social movement on purchasing power).The shipment  at the end of the year  of the first Scarabox¬Æ unit to Cameroon.More generally  the Group benefited from very favourable market conditions for P2R units  with Brent rising from an average of 71$/bbl in 2021 to 99$/bbl in 2022. As gas prices were responsible for a particularly strong demand for fuel oil and gasoil  the selling prices of finished products increased even more.The group's EBITDA has thus increased from -‚Ç¨1.4M in 2021 to +‚Ç¨1.1M in 2022.Excluding Ecoslops Provence  which is in a ramp-up phase  the group's EBITDA would be +‚Ç¨2.1M in 2022 (vs. +‚Ç¨0.2M in 2021).The group's operating cash flow was +‚Ç¨2.9 million for the year. Excluding Ecoslops Provence  it is +3.7 M‚Ç¨.

However  the 2021 financial year included a reversal of provision (no longer applicable) in the amount of ‚Ç¨0.15 million. The personnel expenses have therefore remained stable between the two fiscal years.External expenses increased by ‚Ç¨1.8 million  of which ‚Ç¨1 million was attributable to Ecoslops Provence (start of production in the second half of 2021 as opposed to a full year in 2022) and ‚Ç¨0.8 million to Ecoslops Portugal  which was impacted for ‚Ç¨0.4 million by the increase in the price of electricity and by additional maintenance and transport costs on sales.Net financial result was a loss of ‚Ç¨1.3 million. This mainly comprises the interest expense on the EIB loan for ‚Ç¨1 million.The corporate income tax represents an income of ‚Ç¨0.4 million and is composed of a tax income of ‚Ç¨0.4 million related to the research tax credit  the recognition of deferred tax assets in Portugal for an amount of ‚Ç¨0.2 million and a current tax charge in Portugal of ‚Ç¨0.2 million.Consolidated balance sheet at December 31  2022(Based on audited accounts  reports in progress)In ‚Ç¨'000 FY 2022 FY 2021 Var. k‚Ç¨ Var. % Intangible assets 1 117 1 441 (324) (22)% Tangible assets 33 182 34 342 (1 160) (3)% Financial assets 783 180 603 +335% Fixed assets 35 082 35 963 (881) (2)% Inventory 1 314 1 510 (196) (13)% Trade receivables 4 049 5 090 (1 041) (20)% Other receivables 1 713 1 721 (9) (0)% Deferred tax asset 1 527 1 348 179 +13% Cash and cash equivalent 6 870 6 340 530 +8% Prepaid expenses 869 1 036 (168) (16)% Current assets 16 341 17 045 (704) 24% Total Assets 51 423 53 008 (1 585) (3)% FY 2022 FY 2021 Var. k‚Ç¨ Var. % Capital & Reserves 16 014 19 734 (3 720) (19)% Investing subsidy 1 460 1 556 (96) (6)% Minority shareholders (77) 590 (667) (113)% Net result - Part for the Group (1 793) (3 720) 1 927 (52)% Equity 15 604 18 160 (2 556) (14)% Conditional advance 838 0 838 N/A Prov. for Risks & Charges 96 180 (84) (47)% Financial debt 29 211 28 952 259 1% Trade payables 3 995 4 113 (118) (3)% Social and tax liabilities 1 029 1 053 (24) (2)% Other payables 650 550 100 +18% Current liabilities 5 674 5 716 (42) (1)% Total Liability & Equity 51 423 53 008 (1 585) (3)%Financial position and cash flowsAs of December 31  2022  the Group had nearly ‚Ç¨6.9 million in cash (+‚Ç¨0.5 million compared to December 31  2021) and net debt of ‚Ç¨23.2 million (vs. ‚Ç¨22.6 million as of December 31  2021).

Ecoslops' objective is to build a portfolio of customers worldwide for its units  allowing it to generate revenues throughout the life of the project: sale of the Scarabox  multi-year technical assistance  dividends as a shareholder.In the very short term  Parlym will take  alongside Ecoslops  a minority stake in Valtech Energy in Cameroon (first customer of the Scarabox¬Æ). The two partners also aim to make a second investment in 2023 in Ivory Coast  as soon as the regulatory approvals have been granted.Ecoslops' objective is to set up at least one unit per year under this agreement. Parlym brings its historical presence on the African continent  the securing of project financing and its expertise in project management. Ecoslops brings its know-how and technology in waste recovery  as well as its commercial partnerships.Ecoslops aims to sell at least one more unit per year in the short term in different territories not covered by this agreement and to develop other such partnerships around the world.As a result  the Ecoslops group has chosen to focus its technical and financial resources on the most profitable activities  those that generate the most cash flow in the short term and promise growth in the medium term. This is why it has been decided to:- Develop more rapidly and in partnership the sales of Scarabox  generating quick cash flow and margins;- Focus efforts on cash flow generation for Ecoslops Provence and Portugal P2Rs;- Move from a manufacturer/funder/operator model to a model of licensing its technology and know-how for new P2Rs.As the Antwerp and Singapore projects have the characteristic of requiring long development times (several years)  high financing requirements and long payback periods  it was decided to focus the group's resources on existing assets and no longer on these projects  in view of the fact that the return on investment is too distant for Ecoslops.In Egypt  the request of Ecoslops for a fixed contribution from each vessel to secure the revenues of the project (environmental tax) was not endorsed by the authorities  and this project has become too risky in terms of business model (commercial risk on the turnover to be carried by Ecoslops). It is useful to recall that the study costs were covered by the funding in the form of a FASEP grant.ESGAs a player in circular economy  Ecoslops places major importance on environmental issues  in addition to societal and governance issues. In this context  the Group published its third sustainability report on May 30  2022.The Group's commitment to continuous improvement was illustrated in 2022 by the new rise in its ESG rating resulting from the Ga√Øa Research 2021 campaign. The company thus confirmed its performance as a gold medallist  ranked 39th/371 in the general panel (compared to 170th/390th in the previous campaign)  and 14th/126 in the panel of companies with revenues of less than ‚Ç¨150 million.Perspectives for 2023In 2023  for the Sines unit in Portugal  the company expects a production of around 25 000 tons for the year.For the Marseille unit  after a beginning of 2023 penalised by a maintenance phase  and then by the impossibility of restarting due to the social movement impacting French refineries (pension reform)  the initial objective of producing 15 000 tonnes over the year has been revised downwards to 11 000 tonnes for these conjunctural reasons.Finally  Ecoslops aims to contract the sale of a new Scarabox in Ivory Coast this year.*: EBITDA = Earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization.Financial Agenda:Combined General Meeting: June 13  2023Publication of first-half 2023 revenues: July 12  2023Publication of half-yearly results: September 26  2023ABOUT ECOSLOPSEcoslops is listed on Euronext Growth in ParisISIN code: FR0011490648 - Mnemonic: ALESA / PEA-PME eligible.Investor Relations Contact : info.esa@ecoslops.com - +33 (0)1 83 64 47 43Ecoslops is the cleantech that brings oil into circular economy  by upgrading oil residues into new fuels and light bitumen.

EBITDA is still negative by ‚Ç¨1M (improving by ‚Ç¨0.6M vs. 2021) but would have been close to breakeven in the second half of the year without the impact of the refinery shutdown (social movement on purchasing power).The shipment  at the end of the year  of the first Scarabox¬Æ unit to Cameroon.More generally  the Group benefited from very favourable market conditions for P2R units  with Brent rising from an average of 71$/bbl in 2021 to 99$/bbl in 2022. As gas prices were responsible for a particularly strong demand for fuel oil and gasoil  the selling prices of finished products increased even more.The group's EBITDA has thus increased from -‚Ç¨1.4M in 2021 to +‚Ç¨1.1M in 2022.Excluding Ecoslops Provence  which is in a ramp-up phase  the group's EBITDA would be +‚Ç¨2.1M in 2022 (vs. +‚Ç¨0.2M in 2021).The group's operating cash flow was +‚Ç¨2.9 million for the year. Excluding Ecoslops Provence  it is +3.7 M‚Ç¨.

However  the 2021 financial year included a reversal of provision (no longer applicable) in the amount of ‚Ç¨0.15 million.

Ecoslops' objective is to build a portfolio of customers worldwide for its units  allowing it to generate revenues throughout the life of the project: sale of the Scarabox  multi-year technical assistance  dividends as a shareholder.In the very short term  Parlym will take  alongside Ecoslops  a minority stake in Valtech Energy in Cameroon (first customer of the Scarabox¬Æ). The two partners also aim to make a second investment in 2023 in Ivory Coast  as soon as the regulatory approvals have been granted.Ecoslops' objective is to set up at least one unit per year under this agreement. Parlym brings its historical presence on the African continent  the securing of project financing and its expertise in project management. Ecoslops brings its know-how and technology in waste recovery  as well as its commercial partnerships.Ecoslops aims to sell at least one more unit per year in the short term in different territories not covered by this agreement and to develop other such partnerships around the world.As a result  the Ecoslops group has chosen to focus its technical and financial resources on the most profitable activities  those that generate the most cash flow in the short term and promise growth in the medium term. This is why it has been decided to:- Develop more rapidly and in partnership the sales of Scarabox  generating quick cash flow and margins;- Focus efforts on cash flow generation for Ecoslops Provence and Portugal P2Rs;- Move from a manufacturer/funder/operator model to a model of licensing its technology and know-how for new P2Rs.As the Antwerp and Singapore projects have the characteristic of requiring long development times (several years)  high financing requirements and long payback periods  it was decided to focus the group's resources on existing assets and no longer on these projects  in view of the fact that the return on investment is too distant for Ecoslops.In Egypt  the request of Ecoslops for a fixed contribution from each vessel to secure the revenues of the project (environmental tax) was not endorsed by the authorities  and this project has become too risky in terms of business model (commercial risk on the turnover to be carried by Ecoslops). It is useful to recall that the study costs were covered by the funding in the form of a FASEP grant.ESGAs a player in circular economy  Ecoslops places major importance on environmental issues  in addition to societal and governance issues. In this context  the Group published its third sustainability report on May 30  2022.The Group's commitment to continuous improvement was illustrated in 2022 by the new rise in its ESG rating resulting from the Ga√Øa Research 2021 campaign. The company thus confirmed its performance as a gold medallist  ranked 39th/371 in the general panel (compared to 170th/390th in the previous campaign)  and 14th/126 in the panel of companies with revenues of less than ‚Ç¨150 million.Perspectives for 2023In 2023  for the Sines unit in Portugal  the company expects a production of around 25 000 tons for the year.For the Marseille unit  after a beginning of 2023 penalised by a maintenance phase  and then by the impossibility of restarting due to the social movement impacting French refineries (pension reform)  the initial objective of producing 15 000 tonnes over the year has been revised downwards to 11 000 tonnes for these conjunctural reasons.Finally  Ecoslops aims to contract the sale of a new Scarabox in Ivory Coast this year.*: EBITDA = Earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization.Financial Agenda:Combined General Meeting: June 13  2023Publication of first-half 2023 revenues: July 12  2023Publication of half-yearly results: September 26  2023ABOUT ECOSLOPSEcoslops is listed on Euronext Growth in ParisISIN code: FR0011490648 - Mnemonic: ALESA / PEA-PME eligible.Investor Relations Contact : info.esa@ecoslops.com - +33 (0)1 83 64 47 43Ecoslops is the cleantech that brings oil into circular economy  by upgrading oil residues into new fuels and light bitumen.

(the ""Company"" or ""Valour"") (NEO: DEFI) (GR: MB9) (OTC: DEFTF)  a technology holding company and the first and only publicly traded company that bridges the gap between traditional capital markets  Web3 and decentralized finance  is pleased to announce the launch of a new EU-wide issuance platform for physically stored digital assets in the form of exchange-traded product (ETP) securities.On April 5  2023  Valour Digital Securities Limited (""VDSL"")  a Jersey-based securities issuer  obtained all regulatory approvals by the Swedish and Jersey regulators for an EU-wide offering to investors domiciled in Austria  Belgium  Croatia  Czech Republic  Denmark  Finland  France  Germany  Hungary  Ireland  Italy  Liechtenstein  Luxembourg  the Netherlands  Norway  Malta  Poland  Portugal  Romania  Slovakia and Spain.The new ETP products will be listed on regulated stock exchanges such as Deutsche B√∂rse/Xetra in Frankfurt  Euronext in Paris and Amsterdam and SIX Swiss Exchange in Switzerland. The new ETP program adds to Valour's already existing digital assets securities program  particularly focusing on the Nordic markets and covering a broad range of over 120 crypto currencies and digital assets in form of single underlyings  baskets or indices. Subject to the ultimate assessment by the tax authorities  investments in the new ETP products by private investors domiciled in Germany most likely should not qualify as taxable capital gains if the investment period exceeds one year. Hence  there should be no German tax withholding obligation with respect to the ETPs. VDSL aims to issue up to 15 new products under the name ""1Valour"" by the end of 2023.The new ETP program is designed to attract institutional investors - such as corporates  pension funds  insurances  asset managers and family offices  providing them with a wide selection of secured digital asset securities that are aligned with internal and external investment guidelines and restrictions - as well as retail investors looking for long term holdings paired with asset security. VDSL also provides for joint ""white-label"" offerings which will allow asset managers and family offices to apply self-developed strategies and indices  satisfying the demand on their client side for certain digital asset products and exposures.The ETPs will be secured by the respective digital assets that are physically stored with regulated custody providers. The initial custodians appointed are Komainu (Jersey) Limited  regulated by the Jersey Financial Services Commission  and Copper Technologies (Switzerland) AG  registered with the Financial Services Standard Association (VQF)  a Self-Regulatory Organisation (SRO) officially recognised by the Federal Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA).Physical custody ensures that the underlying assets are stored separately from the issuer in a secure location. They are additionally secured by an independent third party acting as Trustee and pledged for the benefit of the ETP investors. This provides investors with an added layer of security and protection for their assets.In addition  VDSL has entered into contractual arrangements with well-established market players as Market Makers  Authorized Participants and Index Providers  among them being: GHCO  based in the UK  one of the fastest-growing liquidity providers specializing in exchange traded funds and a market maker on all major European exchanges; Compass Financial Technologies SA  an independent Swiss-based company focused on the design  calculation  and administration of market benchmarks and tailor-made quantitative investment strategies through its French affiliate registered as a Benchmarks Administrator under the EU Benchmarks Regulations (EU BMR); as well as Invierno AB (""Vinter"")  based in Sweden  being the benchmark administrator of the Vinter Valour benchmark family and the central recipient of input data with the ability to evaluate the integrity and accuracy of input data on a consistent basis.""The launch of the digital asset backed issuance program is a milestone in Valour's product strategy "" said Olivier Roussy Newton  CEO of Valour Inc. ""It perfectly adds to Valour's mission to offer investors a maximum level of security and facilitated access to the digital assets space. As well as further enhancing the Valour brand in Europe  the asset backed program may be especially of interest for our German investors  given its potential tax advantages.""Valour further announces that total AUM increased by $70 million in 2023  reaching a record high of almost $148 million - an increase of close to 90% since the beginning of 2023. This number includes more than $6.6 million of net new sales in its existing ETP program - 8.5% organic growth next to ordinary market recovery figures.Alongside this upcoming new issuance programme  Valour offers fully hedged digital asset ETPs with low to zero management fees  with product listings across European exchanges  banks and broker platforms.

Spearheaded by two prominent entrepreneurs - Zoeller in partnership with Shark Tank's Barbara Corcoran - the $25 000 in awards hope to motivate budding entrepreneurs looking to kickstart new business ventures.Jefferson's Bourbon Founder Trey Zoeller And Business Mogul Barbara Corcoran Launch Marian McLain Entrepreneurial Fund Tweet this On Tuesday  April 11th 2023  Barbara Corcoran stepped out of the Shark Tank and into the Ivory Peacock in New York City with Jefferson‚Äôs Bourbon founder  Trey Zoeller  to launch the Marian McLain Entrepreneurial Fund - which will help budding entrepreneurs kick start new businesses. Corcoran and Zoeller toast the fund with the new Marian McLain whiskey  inspired by Zoeller‚Äôs 8th generation grandmother  one of the earliest documented women in American Whiskey.After Marian's husband died in the Revolutionary War and to support her five children  she turned to the illegal production and distribution of liquor. Then  in 1799  she became one of the earliest documented women in American whiskey as a result of being arrested for bootlegging and moonshining. Her tenacity ultimately became the inspiration for the Jefferson's brand  and now  with the help of Corcoran  the brand wants to inspire others to do the same.""Just like Marian  I took big risks to create something for myself  and for my family  even when it was incredibly hard "" said Corcoran. ""But with big risk comes big reward - that's what being an entrepreneur is all about! - and that's why I'm partnering with Jefferson's Bourbon to bring the Marian McLain Entrepreneurial Fund to life.""Also echoing Marian  Trey Zoeller and his father  Chet  continue to operate at the frontier of whiskey  challenging the definition of bourbon while never forgetting its past by honoring tradition. The Fund's launch is also perfectly timed with the release of Jefferson's newest bourbon - Marian McLain - a bold blend of five unique bourbons: 21% 14-Year-Old Tennessee Straight Bourbon Whiskey; 40% 11-Year-Old Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey; 14% Wheated Double-Barrel; 17% Rum Cask Finish; 8% 8 Year-Old Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey. One for each of her five children - the final blend is complex and delivers a notable degree of impressive intensity - just like McLain herself.""We started Jefferson's on a shoestring budget and with Marian's vivacious spirit in mind - it's why we do what we do "" says Zoeller. ""This entrepreneurial fund is our way of helping other people who  like Marian and Corcoran  are risking everything to pursue their dreams.""On the Jefferson's website  small business hopefuls are welcome to submit their innovative business ideas with a short video. The grand prize winner  handpicked by Zoeller and Corcoran will receive $20 000 in funding to kickstart their venture  as well as a congratulatory call from Corcoran  and a ""shop talk"" interview with Trey. Five runners up will also be selected to win $1 000 awards - the amount Barbara Corcoran started her business with; small budgets can build big dreams!Submissions open on April 11  2023  closing on May 7  2023.
