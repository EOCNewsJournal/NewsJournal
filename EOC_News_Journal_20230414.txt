The term of the auditor will end at the end of the next annual general meeting following the election.The auditor‚Äôs fees be paid against its reasonable invoice as approved by the company.Authorisations for the board of directorsThe general meeting authorised the board of directors to decide on the repurchase of the company‚Äôs shares using the company‚Äôs unrestricted equity under the following terms and conditions:The total maximum number of shares to be repurchased under the authorisation is 2 500 000 shares  which corresponds to approximately 10.0% of all the shares in the company. The shares will be repurchased in trading on Nasdaq Helsinki Oy‚Äôs regulated market at a price formed in public trading on the date of repurchase. The shares can be repurchased otherwise than in proportion to the existing shareholdings of the company‚Äôs shareholders. The shares will be repurchased using the company‚Äôs distributable unrestricted equity. This authorisation replaces prior authorisations granted to the board of directors to repurchase the company‚Äôs own shares. The authorisation is valid until the end of the annual general meeting of 2024  but in any case no later than 18 months from the general meeting‚Äôs resolution on authorisation.The general meeting authorised the board of directors to decide on the issuance of shares in one or more tranches as well as on the issuance of option rights and other special rights entitling to shares as referred to in chapter 10  section 1 of the Finnish Limited Liability Companies Act as follows:The total maximum number of shares to be issued under the authorisation is 2 500 000 shares  which corresponds to approximately 10.0% of all the shares in the company. The board of directors decides on all the terms and conditions regarding the issuance of shares and the issuance of option rights and other special rights entitling to shares. The authorisation concerns both the issuance of new shares and the transfer of the company‚Äôs own shares. The share issues  and the issuances of option rights and other special rights entitling to shares can take place in deviation from the shareholders‚Äô pre-emptive subscription right (directed issue) if the company has a weighty financial reason to do so  such as the financing or the implementation of a merger or acquisition  the development of the company‚Äôs equity structure or the implementation of the company‚Äôs incentive schemes. The total maximum number of shares to be issued for the purpose of implementing the company‚Äôs incentive schemes is 250 000 shares  which corresponds to approximately 1.0% of all the shares in the company. For the avoidance of doubt  the above number of shares to be issued for the implementation of incentive schemes is included in the overall number of the issuance authorisation referred to in section 1 above. Based on the authorisation  the board of directors is also authorised to decide on a share issue without payment directed to the company itself  provided that the number of shares held by the company after the issue would be a maximum of 10% of all the shares in the company. This amount includes shares that may be held by the company and its subsidiaries in the manner provided for in chapter 15  section 11  subsection 1 of the Finnish Limited Liability Companies Act. The authorisation replaces prior share issue authorisations granted to the board of directors. The authorisation is valid until the end of the annual general meeting of 2024  but in any case no later than 18 months from the general meeting‚Äôs resolution on share issue authorisation.Further information:Hannu NymanCFOhannu.nyman@eezy.fitel. +358 (0)50 306 9913,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,negative,0.01,0.3,0.69,True,English,"['Annual General Meeting', 'Eezy Plc', 'Decisions', '13 April', 'Finnish Limited Liability Companies Act', 'shareholders‚Äô pre-emptive subscription right', 'next annual general meeting', 'Euroclear Finland Oy', 'Mikko Wir√©n', 'KPMG Oy Ab', 'total maximum number', 'reasonable traveling expenses', 'weighty financial reason', 'other special rights', 'Nasdaq Helsinki Oy', 'consolidated financial statements', 'distributable unrestricted equity', 'above number', 'meeting fee', 'committee meeting', 'reasonable invoice', 'option rights', 'equity structure', 'financial year', 'Eezy Oyj', 'EEZY PLC', 'EXCHANGE RELEASE', 'governing bodies', 'shareholder register', 'Tapio Pajuharju', 'Kati Hagros', 'Paul-Petteri Savolainen', 'Jarno Suominen', 'Mika Uotila', 'Maria Pajamo', 'new member', 'other members', 'travelling policy', 'Esa Kailiala', 'existing shareholdings', 'directed issue', 'incentive schemes', 'remuneration report', 'first tranche', 'record date', 'second tranche', 'monthly remuneration', 'The AGM', 'two tranches', 'following terms', 'public trading', 'prior authorisations', 'current auditor', 'responsible auditor', 'Seven members', 'share issues', 'directors‚Äô committees', 'new shares', '2,500,000 shares', '250,000 shares', '13 APRIL', 'Decisions', '10:00 a', 'Kasarmikatu', 'proposals', 'notice', 'board', 'CEOs', 'Dividend', 'company', '25 April', '26 October', 'election', 'chairperson', 'addition', 'Story', 'accordance', 'practices', 'APA', 'fees', 'repurchase', 'conditions', 'market', 'price', 'proportion', 'case', 'resolution', 'issuance', 'one', 'chapter', 'section', 'transfer', 'place', 'deviation', 'financing', 'implementation', 'merger', 'acquisition', 'development', 'purpose', 'avoidance', 'doubt', '18']",2023-04-13,2023-04-14,finance.yahoo.com

These guidelines shall also apply regarding remuneration (for example consultant‚Äôs fee)  if any  for work carried out by a board member  in addition to the board assignment  for the corporate group of NIBE or one of its group companies. Unless otherwise stated below  the guidelines do not apply to the board member remuneration  which are determined by the Annual General Meeting.The guidelines shall promote the business strategy  long-term interests and sustainability of the companyIn short  NIBE‚Äôs business strategy is to provide world-class sustainable energy solutions. For more information regarding the company‚Äôs business strategy  visit www.nibe.com. A successful implementation of the company‚Äôs business strategy and the procurement of NIBE‚Äôs long-term interests  including its sustainability  rely on NIBE‚Äôs ability to attract and retain a management that is highly qualified and with the capacity to reach stated goals. Thus  it is a prerequisite that the company can offer remuneration terms that are competitive. These guidelines enable NIBE to offer remuneration to senior executives on market terms and to be competitive in order to attract and retain personnel.Types of remunerationRemuneration may be paid as fixed salary  variable salary  pension and other benefits such as car benefit.Board fees shall not be paid to senior executives  who are employed in the group.All senior executives  who have not reached the age of 65  shall have retirement benefits corresponding to the defined benefit ITP-plan (supplementary pensions for ¬≠salaried employees) (SW: ITP-planen)  section 2  for salary parts up to 30 income base amounts (SW: inkomstbasbelopp). For salary parts exceeding 30 income base amounts  a premium with a fixed percentage of 30% shall be paid  in accordance with the same principles as in the ITP-plan with fixed premium  section 1. The retirement premiums may  in total  amount to a maximum of 35% of the total remuneration. Senior executives  who have reached the age of 65  are not entitled to retirement benefits.Other benefits  i.a. medical insurance  life insurance and car benefit  may  in total  amount to a maximum of 5% of the total remuneration.Criteria for payment of variable remunerationSenior executives shall as incentive be able to obtain a variable salary part  which is paid if the goals that have been set are met. These goals are set by the board of directors and shall be measurable and predetermined  e.g. percentage growth  operating margin and working capital reduction. The goals are set for one financial year at a time. By rewarding clear and measurable performance linked to the company‚Äôs financial and operational development  the goals set shall promote to motivate the senior executives to achieve the company‚Äôs goals regarding business strategies  long-term interests and sustainability.The variable salary part shall be limited to four monthly salaries. In addition thereto  an extra monthly salary may be paid as remuneration  provided that the senior executive uses this extra remuneration and an additional monthly salary of his/her variable remuneration for acquisition of NIBE-shares. A condition for the extra remuneration is that the senior executive keeps the annually acquired NIBE-shares for at least three years. If the condition is not met  the company is entitled to recover this part of the remuneration. The purpose of the extra remuneration for acquisition of NIBE-shares is to increase the senior executives‚Äô longterm interests in the company and hence promote the company‚Äôs business strategy  long-term interests and sustainability. Normally  the senior executives‚Äô acquisition of NIBE-shares will be made once a year in February/March  with regard to applicable market abuse legislation. The managing director shall not be included in any incentive program.Termination of employmentSenior executives shall be employed for an indefinite or fixed term.Upon termination by the company  the term of notice for the managing director shall be six months. The managing director shall be entitled to severance payment corresponding to twelve monthly salaries.Other senior executives shall receive salary during the term of notice  which varies between 6-12 months.There shall be no special agreement stating that senior executives may terminate their employment before they have reached retirement age and until then receive a certain part of their salary.Consideration of salary and terms of employment when preparing the guidelinesWhen preparing the board of directors‚Äô proposal for these guidelines  the average salary and terms of employment of the employees at the Swedish companies within the NIBE group have been taken into account. This has been achieved by obtaining information regarding the employees‚Äô average salary and terms of employment as well as rate of increase of remuneration over time during the employment at NIBE. A very important additional factor has been the group‚Äôs growth  with regard to the turnover as well as the result. Moreover  comparison has been made with other Swedish listed companies of the same size. This information has been part of the board of directors‚Äô decisionmaking ¬≠documentation in order to evaluate the reasonableness of the guidelines.Fees for consultancy services performed by board membersThe company‚Äôs board members elected by the Annual General Meeting may in special cases be remunerated for consultancy services within their respective fields of competence  which do not constitute the board assignment  for a limited time. For these services  remuneration shall be offered on market terms.How these guidelines have been preparedThese guidelines have been prepared by the board of directors. The managing director and the other senior¬≠executives have not participated in the board of directors‚Äô preparations and decisions regarding these guidelines.The guidelines are subject to annual review through personal contact by the chairman of the board with the major shareholders.Deviation from these guidelinesThe board of directors may deviate from the guidelines as regards pension  bonus and other benefits if there are particular grounds for a deviation in a special case and if it is necessary in order to meet the company‚Äôs long-term interests and sustainability or to ensure the company‚Äôs financial viability.The presence of significant changesThe proposal for guidelines is in line with the guidelines approved at the Annual General Meeting in 2022. The annual review of the guidelines has not resulted in any significant changes.Documents availableThe annual report and the auditor‚Äôs report  complete proposals for decision concerning items 16 and 17  the auditor‚Äôs statement according to Chapter 8 Section 54 of the Swedish Companies Act and other documents will be kept available for the shareholders at the company‚Äôs premises in Markaryd and on the company‚Äôs web site  www.nibe.com  at the latest from 25 April 2023 and will be sent to shareholders requesting it and stating their address.Right to informationThe shareholders have the right to request information at the Annual General Meeting concerning conditions that may have an effect on the assessment of an item on the agenda and conditions that may have an effect on the assessment of the company‚Äôs financial situation.Shares and votesAt the time of execution of this notice the total number of shares in the company amounts to 2 016 066 488  of which 233 130 360 shares of class A and 1 782 936 128 shares of class B.

22850,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/european-exchanges-defensive-appeal-attracts-investors-after-bank-turmoil-2023-04-14/,European exchanges' defensive appeal attracts investors after bank turmoil,European exchange stocks stand to benefit from a spike in volatility surrounding the downfall of Credit Suisse   as some investors turn towards bourse operators attracted by their defensive qualities and modest valuations.,"[1/3] Bull and bear symbols are seen in front of the German stock exchange (Deutsche Boerse) in Frankfurt  Germany  February 12  2019. REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach/File PhotoMILAN/LONDON  April 14 (Reuters) - European exchange stocks stand to benefit from a spike in volatility surrounding the downfall of Credit Suisse (CSGN.S)  as some investors turn towards bourse operators attracted by their defensive qualities and modest valuations.The exchanges' share price performance has lagged the region-wide STOXX 600 (.STOXX) index by up to 13 percentage points since September  as investors chased banks  potentially a more attractive trade because of rising interest rates (.SX7P).But after a quiet start to the year for trading activity  the turbulence in March is spurring some investors to shift their exposure as part of a wider shift away from banking into other sectors.Spikes in bond and equity volatility could yield positive earning surprises for exchange companies during the upcoming reporting season  just when tightening credit conditions risk hitting economic growth  making defensive businesses like exchanges more attractive.Exchange operators' shares have outperformed in the past few weeks  with traders and analysts pointing to signs of investors rotating into exchanges  partly at the expense of banks. Volume spikes tend to boost activity across trades processed by exchange operators.""There's rotation  the most obvious and public example of this is in the price action "" said Andrew Morgan  president at U.S.-based financial technology provider TS Imagine.""Exchange operators are data and technology businesses with defensive utility-like features  while banks are highly cyclical and exposed to idiosyncratic business model risks"".Equity trades across Euronext (ENX.PA)  which runs exchanges in seven big European centres from Paris to Amsterdam and Milan  reached the third-highest value in the company's history on March 17. Its average daily traded volumes in March were the highest in a year.Swiss exchange SIX  at the epicentre of the turmoil around UBS's (UBSG.S) rescue of Credit Suisse  had a 44.6% jump in March turnover compared with February. Cash market turnover at Deutsche Boerse (DB1Gn.DE) rose 23.7% last month versus February.Average daily value traded at the London Stock Exchange (LSEG) (LSEG.L) rose 12.9% month-over-month in March. Thomson Reuters  which owns Reuters News  has been a shareholder in LSEG since 2021. LSEG also pays Reuters for news.snapshotVOLATILITY BOOSTEvidence of any shift could be revealed when filings disclosing how mutual funds have tweaked their positions are published in a few weeks' time.UBS research that uses the bank's prime brokerage data and other sources showed in April that investor ""crowding"" in exchange operators' stocks has been recovering from four-year lows.Among financials in Europe  exchange stocks are the most positively correlated to volatility.Banking turmoil and option expiries drove the Euro STOXX volatility index (.V2TX) last month to its highest since October in a steep surge that quickly pared back. The MOVE index (.MOVE)  a gauge of fixed-income volatility  hit 2008 levels and remains high.""Investors tend to look at the exchanges as defensive names. In recessionary environments  we tend to see money being allocated increasingly to the exchanges "" said Micheal Werner  senior equity analyst at UBS in London.""The number of incoming calls I have had on the exchanges has certainly increased over the past two or three weeks as people are working at the allocations within the financial space of their portfolio "" he added.Werner said uncertainty over monetary policy should keep bond volatility elevated  supporting exchange stocks  while spikes in equity volatility tend to be bad for investment banking  M&A and customer fund flows at big universal banks.Deutsche Boerse has rallied more than 10% since the bank turmoil started in March with the collapse of U.S. regional bank SVB. Deutsche Boerse shares hit a lifetime high on Thursday.LSEG and Euronext have risen almost 8% and 4% respectively  while Amsterdam-based market maker Flow Traders (FLOW.AS)  which also benefits from volatility  is up more than 13%.Over the same period  European banks have lost around 12%.Looking to the long term  some investors see the exchange industry benefiting from data demand.And exchange valuations are near multi-year lows which suggests any downside could be limited.Euronext trades at 14 times 12-month forward earnings and LSEG at 22 times  both an 18% discount to their five-year averages  as per Refinitiv Datastream.U.S. rival Nasdaq Inc (NDAQ.O) trades on a multiple of 20  just a 3% discount to its 5-year average and Intercontinental Exchange Inc (ICE.N) which trades on a multiple of 19  is 4.7% below its 5-year average.""Beyond being volatility beneficiaries  which makes them attractive within a diversified portfolio context  we also believe they are well-placed for data demand and consumption trends "" said Thomas McGarrity  head of equities at RBC Wealth Management.

It should be noted that growth in France remained brisk  in the double digits.The share of Software & Services represented 14% of quarterly revenue  versus 15% in FY 2022  considering a particularly high basis for comparison (up +64% in Q1 2022).Record sales growth in North America: +86%  representing 30% of revenueThis past quarter was characterized by similar growth in France and international business  amounting to +15%.The share of international activity accounted for 67% of revenue in Q1 2023  compared to 64% for FY 2022.In North America  Ekinops achieved record quarterly growth of +86% in Q1 2023 (+79% in US dollars). For the first time  on a quarterly basis  this region represented 30% of Group sales. This vigorous momentum was underpinned by highly sustained growth for Optical Transport solutions  including significant deliveries to an important US service provider that covers 16 states and selected Ekinops to scale and level up the reliability of its fiber network.Story continuesEMEA (Europe  excluding France  the Middle-East and Africa)  which represents 34% of the Group's activity  posted a decline of -7% in its quarterly sales. Considering the basis for comparison (up +21% in Q1 2022)  this trend is not indicative of the growth levels expected for the region on a full-year basis.Asia-Pacific reported a -40% decline which is also immaterial since it follows a +113% increase in sales over Q1 2022.

Florentaise has more than 600 own-brand and private-label products available at major retailers (Truffaut  Botanic  Syst√®me U  Lidl). The company sells close to one in five bags of all bags of potting soil that are sold to end consumers in France and serves 12% of the professional market. Florentaise's products have also been selected for major urban projects such as the Olympic Village for the 2024 Olympic Games  the Louis Vuitton Foundation  the Forum des Halles in Paris and the City of Angers. The Group markets patented wood fibres Hortifibre¬Æ and Turbofibre¬Æ which allow users to avoid the use of peat  present in traditional potting soils and resulting in 20 to 50 times reduced greenhouse gas emissions.The IPO of Florentaise on Euronext Growth Paris aims to allow the company to pursue its development strategy centred around its original business model of direct sales for potting soils in France and China and leasing Florentaise's production facilities to other potting soil makers in Europe and North America. This model  which combines rental income and maintenance costs  has already led to the commercialisation of seven machines to leading potting soil makers in the UK and the Netherlands. The Group intends to strengthen its footprint in China with the installation of three new production units planned by 2025  with a growth rate of over 85% per year since 2020 in this country.Florentaise was listed through the admission to trading on 12 April 2023 of 8 248 693 ordinary shares making up its equity and of 1 891 893 new shares issued under a Global Offering1.The admission and issue price of Florentaise shares was set at ‚Ç¨9.44 per share. Market capitalisation was approximately ‚Ç¨78 million on the day of listing. The IPO raised ‚Ç¨18 million altogether.Jean-PascalChupin  CEO of Florentaise  said: ""We are very proud to begin today  with this IPO  a new chapter in the history of Florentaise.

Adjusted for this contribution  quarterly revenue remains robust and represents an all-time high of ‚Ç¨1.4 million despite a temporary delay in Latin America due to regulatory procedures for the approval of new products.The Europe area is driving growth and accounts for 57% of consolidated revenue over the quarter. Revenue amounts to ‚Ç¨1.4 million  a 3.2-fold increase compared with the same period last year  thereby confirming the commercial strategy announced last year. The area benefits from the sales‚Äô dynamics in France  where the ramp-up of the Distimp ranges and the contribution of the Spine Innovations ranges are paying off.This first quarter of 2023 confirms the rollout of Spineway‚Äôs product strategy and the successful integration of Spine Innovations.These developments  combined with R&D investments dedicated to new product lines  will help position Spineway as a leading international player in the spine sector.Next events : July 11  2023 ‚Äì H1 2023 revenueSPINEWAY IS ELIGIBLE FOR PEA-SME (EQUITY SAVINGS PLANS FOR SMES)Find out all about Spineway at www.spineway.com.This press release has been prepared in both English and French.

A summary of the consolidated financial statements is included further below.Pascal Prigent  CEO of GENFIT  commented:‚Äú2022 was a transformative year for GENFIT. It was marked by both the fast progression of our lead program and the expansion of our pipeline in rare and severe liver diseases  notably with the acquisition of Versantis AG. We are now approaching an inflection point: this quarter we expect to report data from our pivotal Phase 3 study in PBC. There is still an important unmet medical need in this market  and we are very encouraged by the previous Phase 2 data reported as part of this program. We believe elafibranor has significant potential  and we hope it will be demonstrated soon. Beyond this exciting milestone  we have built a rich pipeline  that now includes 3 additional phase 2-stage programs and 2 preclinical-stage programs. This pipeline  combined with a robust cash position and the near-term commercial perspectives for elafibranor  provide us with a unique opportunity to drive transformative value in 2023.‚Äù2022 Key HighlightsPBC program executed according to planPatient enrollment for the ELATIVE¬Æ Phase 3 trial evaluating elafibranor in PBC was completed mid-2022. Throughout 2022 GENFIT and Ipsen stepped up their collaboration in order to minimize the time to filing as well as prepare for the commercial launch next year  if approved.Pipeline progressAcquisition of the clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company VersantisIn September 2022  GENFIT acquired clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company Versantis based in Zurich (Switzerland)  significantly expanding its pipeline. This acquisition has reinforced GENFIT‚Äôs position as a leader in ACLF and other severe liver diseases. Given the unmet need related to target diseases  it is expected that the programs qualify for some of the expedited regulatory pathways provided by health authorities.Two Pipeline Days were organized in October 2022 in Paris and New York  to present these programs in detail. A replay of these events is available here: https://ir.genfit.com/events/event-details/genfit-pipeline-day-nycAssessment of Nitazoxanide (NTZ) in hepatic and renal impaired patientsTwo Phase 1 studies were conducted  aimed at providing insight into NTZ pharmacokinetics and safety in the setting of hepatic impairment or renal impairment  in order to prepare for the launch of a Phase 2 study in ACLF in the second half of 2023.Orphan Drug Designation granted to GNS561 for the treatment of cholangiocarcinomaIn September 2022 the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Orphan Drug Designation to GNS561 (ezurpimtrostat)  a novel clinical-stage autophagy/PPT1 inhibitor  for the treatment of cholangiocarcinoma (CCA).Compelling results for NIS2+TM in NASHIn October 2022  GENFIT announced the development of NIS2+TM  a next-generation technology for the diagnosis of at-risk NASH  and the presentation of results on NIS2TM+‚Äôs clinical performance in three poster presentations at The Liver Meeting¬Æ 2022 organized by the AASLD2. The NIMBLE initiative of the FNIH3 highlighted in 2021 the strong and unique performance of NIS4¬Æ technology in identifying patients with at-risk NASH.II. 2023 Anticipated MilestonesTopline Phase 3 data for elafibranor in PBC: towards the end of 2Q23Topline results for the ELATIVE¬Æ study are now imminent and expected to be announced towards the end of the second quarter of 2023.Phase 2 results showed a statistically significant improvement on both the primary and composite biochemical evaluation criteria  the latter now being the primary endpoint of the pivotal Phase 3 trial to support accelerated approval. In addition  the results showed a positive trend on the improvement of pruritus  while preserving a favorable safety and tolerability profile. These positive conclusions were published in the Journal of Hepatology in 2021.4 Safety data derived from more than 1 000 patients in the biopsy-based Phase 3 RESOLVE-IT¬Æ trial of elafibranor in NASH also supported further development in PBC.Under the agreement with Ipsen  GENFIT is eligible to receive regulatory  commercial  and sales-based milestone payments up to ‚Ç¨360 million  with a potential first significant milestone payment as early as 2023 and an additional potential milestone payment in 2024  if ELATIVE¬Æ is successful. In addition  GENFIT is eligible for double-digit royalties of up to 20%. In the case of a positive trial outcome  the well-established global commercial footprint of Ipsen will be an important driver of commercial success. By 2024  if approved  elafibranor could potentially become a new therapeutic option for PBC patients not responding to UDCA5  and become the first alternative to currently approved second line treatment in a market estimated at $1.5bn in the coming years  and $3.1 billion in the US and in the five main European countries by 2030.6Additional clinical programs underway1st patient screening in a Phase 2 study evaluating VS-01 in ACLF: 2Q23An international Phase 2  open-label  randomized  controlled  multi-center  proof of concept study will assess the efficacy  safety and tolerability of VS-01 in addition to standard of care (SOC)  compared to SOC alone  in approximately 60 adult patients with ACLF grades 1 and 2 and who also have ascites. A Phase 1 trial highlighted the favorable safety and tolerability profile of VS-01 and provided encouraging preliminary efficacy results  with >80% of treated patients improving or stabilizing their disease (Child-Pugh Score assessment). It is anticipated that the first patient will be screened in this trial in the second quarter of 2023. Given the high unmet need in this indication and the Orphan Drug Designation obtained from the FDA for VS-01  it is expected that the program qualifies for some of the expedited regulatory pathways provided by health authorities.The overall market size of ACLF is estimated to be almost $4 billion in the US and in the five main European countries by 2030.7NTZ Phase 1 outcome in ACLF: May 2023GENFIT is developing a second program in ACLF in which it is evaluating NTZ. Two Phase 1 studies were completed in the fourth quarter of 2022 and the first quarter of 2023  and are expected to provide preliminary insight into NTZ pharmacokinetics and safety in the setting of hepatic impairment or renal impairment. Outcome of both the hepatic impairment study and the renal impairment study will be announced in May 2023. A Phase 2a proof of concept study in patients with ACLF grades 1 and 2 is currently under discussion with the FDA  and study initiation is targeted for the second half of 2023.1st patient screening in a Phase 1b/2a study evaluating GNS561 in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA): targeted towards the end of 2Q23A Phase 1b/2a trial will evaluate GNS561 in patients with advanced KRAS mutated CCA. In the Phase 1b  patients will be enrolled to evaluate the safety and tolerability of GNS561 when given in combination with a MEK inhibitor  and to identify the recommended doses of the combination to be administered in the Phase 2a study. GENFIT targets to screen the first patient towards the end of the second quarter of 2023. Given the high unmet need in this indication and the Orphan Drug Designation obtained from the FDA for GNS561  it is expected that the program qualifies for some of the expedited regulatory pathways provided by health authorities.The overall market size of CCA is estimated to be more than $3 billion in the US and in the five main European countries by 2030.8Preclinical programsIn addition to clinical programs  GENFIT is also pursuing the development of two preclinical programs:VS-01-HAC is a potential first-line lifesaving treatment for acute hyperammonemic crisis associated with Inborn Errors of Metabolism in Urea Cycle Disorders (UCD) and Organic Acidemias (OA). Investigational New Drug (IND) enabling nonclinical studies are targeted to be completed in 2024.VS-02-HE is developed in Hepatic Encephalopathy (HE)  which is one of the major complications of advanced liver disease and portal hypertension. As many as 45% of patients with cirrhosis will experience at least one episode of HE. VS-02-HE is a urease inhibitor  and a hydroxamic acid derivative  designed to inhibit ureases by binding to nickel atoms in their active site. IND enabling nonclinical studies are targeted to be completed in 2025.Although these are early-stage programs  they represent a significant potential due to the high unmet medical need.

The audit procedures by the Statutory Auditors are underway.Revenues and other incomesRevenue and other operating income for 2022 amounted to ‚Ç¨26.6 million compared to ‚Ç¨85.6 million for 2021.In 2022  our revenue totaled ‚Ç¨20.2 million and came from three streams related to Ipsen:In December 2021  we received a ‚Ç¨120m non-refundable upfront payment from Ipsen as part of our Collaboration and Licencing agreement. ‚Ç¨80m was recognized as revenue in 2021  and ‚Ç¨40m was booked as deferred revenue and is gradually recognized as revenue in subsequent periods following the progress of the ELATIVE¬Æ double-blind study. As such  of that initial ‚Ç¨40m in the deferred revenue balance  ‚Ç¨15.9m was recognized as revenue in 2022.‚Ç¨3.3 million was recognized as revenue in 2022 in accordance with the Inventory Purchase Agreement signed with Ipsen  pursuant to which Ipsen purchased inventory of elafibranor active pharmaceutical ingredient and drug product during the second half of 2022  with the prospect of transferring the conduct of the ELATIVE¬Æ study to Ipsen.‚Ç¨1.0 million in revenue was generated from the services rendered by GENFIT to Ipsen in accordance with the Transition Services Agreement signed in 2022  which essentially outlines the scope of services to facilitate the transition of some activities related to the Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating elafibranor in PBC.In 2022  other operating income totaled ‚Ç¨6.4 million. This included mainly the research tax credit (known as Cr√©dit d‚ÄôImp√¥t Recherche or CIR) granted by the French tax authorities  which amounted to ‚Ç¨6.0m. This is up from ‚Ç¨5.3 million for 2021. This is due to an increase in our research activities in 2022.Operating results and expensesOperating expenses for 2022 amounted to ‚Ç¨53.9 million  compared to ‚Ç¨53.8 million for 2021. This is comprised of research and development expenses  general and administrative expenses  marketing and market access expenses  reorganization and restructuring expenses  and other operating expenses.The slight increase is due to multiple factors:The increase in research and development costs of ‚Ç¨0.6 million  explained by the increase in costs related to new programs and product candidates  in particular NTZ  VS-01 and GNS561  offset by the sharp reduction in study costs related to RESOLVE-IT¬Æ The increase in general and administrative expenses of ‚Ç¨0.2 million  explained by the increase in costs related to liability insurance  the increase in costs related to consulting fees  and other charges in the normal course of business The decrease in marketing and market access expenses of ‚Ç¨0.5 million  mainly explained by the decrease in marketing activity in the United States and France The decrease in reorganization and restructuring charges of ‚Ç¨0.1 million (effectively null in 2022)  and the decrease of other operating expenses of ‚Ç¨0.1 million.In 2022  GENFIT generated a consolidated operating loss of ‚Ç¨27.3 million  compared to an operating income of ‚Ç¨31.8 million in 2021.Financial results2022 resulted in a financial income of ‚Ç¨3.5 million compared to a financial income of ‚Ç¨37.7 million in 2021.In 2022  financial income is due to net foreign exchange gains of ‚Ç¨7.1 million  interest income of ‚Ç¨0.7 million  offset by interest expense of ‚Ç¨4.3 million.In 2021  financial income was due to net foreign exchange gains of ‚Ç¨6.7 million  interest income of ‚Ç¨0.3 million  offset by interest expense of ‚Ç¨4.9 million. In addition  the company recorded a one time gain of 35.6 million corresponding to a repurchase bonus following the renegotiation of the OCEANEs in January 2021.The foreign exchange result on cash and cash equivalents was a net gain of ‚Ç¨7.1 million in 2022  compared to ‚Ç¨6.7 million in 2021. This is notably due to the difference in currency exchange recognized on cash and other current financial assets in US dollars  as GENFIT has decided to keep some of its cash in US dollars. These cash and other current financial assets in US dollars are to be used to pay directly expenses in US dollars (natural currency hedge).Cash positionAs of December 31  2022  the Company‚Äôs cash and cash equivalents and current financial assets amounted to ‚Ç¨140.6 million compared with ‚Ç¨258.8 million as of December 31  2021.This is mainly the result of the following  in addition to normal business activity:The payment of ‚Ç¨24.0 million in January 2022 representing the VAT collected on the initial upfront payment received from Ipsen in December 2021 The disbursement of employee participation in the profits of GENFIT SA in May 2022 for a total of ‚Ç¨0.6 million for the financial year 2021  andThe acquisition of Versantis AG totaling ‚Ç¨41.5m net of cash acquired.GENFIT will host a conference call in English and in French on April 14  2023 at 8.00am ET / 1:00pm GMT / 2:00pm CETBoth the English and French conference calls will be accessible on the investor page of our website  under the ‚ÄòEvents and presentation‚Äô section at https://ir.genfit.com or by calling 888-394-8218 (toll-free U.S and Canada)  0800-279-0425 (toll-free UK) or 0805 101 219 (toll-free France) five minutes prior to the start time (confirmation code: 8860599).

There is a constant pressure to always be available...,"According to the latest YouGov survey commissioned by HEINEKEN¬Æ  work has been cited as the top reason why Gen Zs and young millennial employees in Singapore and Malaysia 'ghost' their friends  significantly impacting their social life and relationship with friends and family. Partnering with Park Hyung-Sik  HEINEKEN¬Æ wants to raise awareness and remind employees of the importance of working responsibly and maintaining a healthy work-life balance.SINGAPORE  April 13  2023 /PRNewswire/ -- In our hyperconnected world today  it is easier than ever to connect with employees on their devices. There is a constant pressure to always be available  even while on-the-go  adding on to the hours that an employee overworks. Overworking is also often seen as a good sign of employees being successful in their career  especially in Asia  and this poses a challenge for employees in this fast-paced environment to dedicate time outside of work to socialise.As a brand that has always stood for creating shared connections with others  HEINEKEN¬Æ's latest Work Responsibly campaign partners with global Korean Actor Park Hyung-Sik to shed light on the overworking culture that is still commonplace in Singapore and Malaysia. Staying true to their enjoyment of life values  through this campaign  HEINEKEN¬Æ wants to remind Gen Zs and young millennials to work responsibly and not let their social life down by 'ghosting' their friends.While 'ghosting' is a term typically used in dating  the phenomenon of friendship 'ghosting' is becoming increasingly common. There are many possible reasons why friends start to 'ghost' one another  but according to the latest YouGov survey commissioned by HEINEKEN¬Æ  work has been cited as the top reason (45%) why employees in Singapore and Malaysia 'ghost' their friends  with family commitments coming in at a close second (34.5%).As part of HEINEKEN¬Æ's latest #WorkResponsibly campaign  the brand has teamed up with globally renowned Korean Actor Park Hyung-Sik to release an unbranded video depicting paranormal occurrences within a bar setting. The intention behind this creative approach is to pique audience's attention and lead them towards the campaign's tongue in cheek tagline which emphasises the idea that a friend consumed by work is nothing but a ghost haunting the bar.Story continues""Through this meaningful project by Heineken  we want to encourage employees to start working responsibly "" says Global Korean Actor Park Hyung Sik. ""We should enjoy our social life and not let it be impacted by our work "" Park Hyung Sik added.According to the survey  46.5% of employees in Singapore and Malaysia have ""ghosted"" their friends due to work obligations. 54% shared that because of the lack of work-life balance  it has impacted their life significantly ‚Äî 64.5% feel burned out at work  while 42.5% revealed that work has caused strains in their relationship with their friends and partners.A Culture of Overworking and PresenteeismOver the years  employers have been placing more effort on helping employees achieve work-life balance by implementing benefits such as extended annual leaves  mental wellness day off  and flexible working arrangements. However  the commissioned study by Heineken¬Æ shows that 33.5% of Singapore and Malaysia employees still find their social life significantly impacted due to work.One reason for overworking that's unique to not just Singapore and Malaysia but the entire APAC region is a workplace culture of presenteeism ‚Äî the feeling of confusion and guilt over leaving work on time despite finishing the day's work or feeling obligated to stay back at work until managers or seniors leave.Employees Are Still Letting Their Social Life Down Due to Work Despite Enhanced Wellness Benefits59% of employees in Singapore and Malaysia agree that while their employers value work-life balance and encourages them to take time off  they still do not see improvement in their social life and often find themselves 'ghosting' their friends due to work. This is because employees (68.5%) find themselves unable to reject extra work given to them ‚Äî 73% are afraid to reject extra work because they were assigned by their seniors / managers while 41% are afraid that it will affect their promotions as they will be deemed as ""lazy"".Despite 88% of respondents acknowledged the beneficial impact of work-life balance on their social life  and 77.5% of employees in Singapore and Malaysia placing greater importance on achieving work-life balance and a sense of fulfilment  they continue to prioritise work over their social life. However  88% believe that their organisations could help reduce overworking hours by doing more to encourage employees to have a healthier social life.Together with Park Hyung-Sik  HEINEKEN¬Æ wants to encourage a refresh mindset towards this culture of overworking that is still prominent in Singapore and Malaysia  and remind Gen Zs and millennials of the importance of working responsibly and maintaining work-life balance.As part of HEINEKEN¬Æ's latest #WorkResponsibly campaign  there will be activations in Singapore and Malaysia to remind individuals to work responsibly and knock off work on time to socialise with friends. In Singapore  Heineken¬Æ Silver will be hosting 'The Ghosted Bar' event on 19 April 2023 whereby attendees will have the chance to experience a range of 'paranormal' themed activities. In Malaysia  40 'paranormal ghosted bar' experiences will take place across the country.""The #WorkResponsibly platform is raising awareness of the sensitive work-life balance issue around the world. Heineken has always encouraged and fostered socialisation and healthy human connections as we feel that workers need to embrace more social and leisure time. We're thrilled to bring this platform to Singapore and Malaysia as a reminder to leave your duties on time and not let your social life fall behind "" says Bram Westenbrink  Global Head Heineken Brand.More information on the most recent study commissioned by HEINEKEN¬Æ to better understand how overworking has impacted employees' social life can be found here.More information on HEINEKEN¬Æ's #WorkResponsibly campaign activations in Singapore and Malaysia can be found here.High-res images can be downloaded here.

It should be noted that growth in France remained brisk  in the double digits.The share of Software & Services represented 14% of quarterly revenue  versus 15% in FY 2022  considering a particularly high basis for comparison (up +64% in Q1 2022).Record sales growth in North America: +86%  representing 30% of revenueThis past quarter was characterized by similar growth in France and international business  amounting to +15%.The share of international activity accounted for 67% of revenue in Q1 2023  compared to 64% for FY 2022.In North America  Ekinops achieved record quarterly growth of +86% in Q1 2023 (+79% in US dollars). For the first time  on a quarterly basis  this region represented 30% of Group sales. This vigorous momentum was underpinned by highly sustained growth for Optical Transport solutions  including significant deliveries to an important US service provider that covers 16 states and selected Ekinops to scale and level up the reliability of its fiber network.EMEA (Europe  excluding France  the Middle-East and Africa)  which represents 34% of the Group's activity  posted a decline of -7% in its quarterly sales. Considering the basis for comparison (up +21% in Q1 2022)  this trend is not indicative of the growth levels expected for the region on a full-year basis.Asia-Pacific reported a -40% decline which is also immaterial since it follows a +113% increase in sales over Q1 2022. Asia-Pacific accounted for 3% of the quarter's business volumes.Lastly  in line with FY 2022  Ekinops continued to generate sharp growth in France. Sales increased steadily by +15% in the domestic market  representing 33% of quarterly revenue. This trend reflects the double-digit growth posted for Optical Transport and Access solutions alike in France.2023 guidance confirmedEkinops has made an excellent start to FY 2023 and confirms its 2023 financial targets:revenue growth of more than +12% ;; EBITDA margin between 15% and 19%  including human and technological investments to support its growth.In terms of external growth  Ekinops reaffirms its ambition to complete at least one transaction during the year  favoring a non-dilutive source of financing.All press releases are published after Euronext Paris market close.More information on Ekinops website: https://www.ekinops.com/All press releases are published after the close of trading on Euronext Paris.EKINOPS ContactDidier Br√©dyChairman and CEOcontact@ekinops.comInvestorsMathieu OmnesInvestor relationTel.: +33 (0)1 53 67 36 92momnes@actus.frLogo: https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/814911/Ekinops_Logo.jpgView original content: https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ekinops-q1-2023-31-9m-revenue-up-15-301797032.htmlSOURCE Ekinops,neutral,0.0,0.99,0.0,positive,0.8,0.19,0.01,True,English,"['Ekinops', 'important US service provider', 'constant exchange rates', 'Didier Br√©dy', 'first three months', 'Optical Transport solutions', 'Optical Transport activity', 'record quarterly growth', 'Euronext Paris market', 'Record sales growth', 'US dollars', 'domestic market', 'first time', 'telecommunications solutions', 'Access solutions', 'leading supplier', 'telecom operators', 'audited data', 'solid performance', 'business lines', 'continued success', 'WDM systems', 'double digits', 'North America', 'international business', 'international activity', 'vigorous momentum', 'significant deliveries', 'fiber network', 'business volumes', 'excellent start', '2023 financial targets', 'EBITDA margin', 'technological investments', 'one transaction', 'dilutive source', 'press releases', 'More information', 'Mathieu Omnes', 'Investor relation', 'original content', 'quarterly basis', 'quarterly sales', 'quarterly revenue', 'full-year basis', 'high basis', 'first quarter', 'strong growth', 'similar growth', 'growth levels', 'sharp growth', 'double-digit growth', 'external growth', 'consolidated revenue', 'annual guidance', '+12% revenue growth', 'past quarter', 'Group sales', 'Ekinops website', 'EKINOPS Contact', 'SOURCE Ekinops', 'Q1 revenue', '+15% growth', '+20% growth', '2023 guidance', 'April', 'PRNewswire', 'enterprises', 'January', 'March', 'IFRS', 'end', 'FY', 'back', 'continuity', 'France', 'share', 'Software', 'Services', 'comparison', 'region', '16 states', 'reliability', 'EMEA', 'Europe', 'Middle-East', 'Africa', 'decline', 'Asia-Pacific', '+113% increase', 'human', 'terms', 'ambition', 'financing', 'close', 'trading', 'Chairman', 'CEO', 'Investors', 'Tel.', 'momnes', 'Logo', 'news-releases', '33']",2023-04-13,2023-04-14,marketscreener.com

All audit procedures have been carried out.Commenting on these results  Fahd Khadraoui  Chief Executive Officer of Marie Brizard Wine & Spirits  said: ‚ÄúThe Group continued to improve its operating performance in 2022. During the year  we successfully created value by working on multiple fronts: intensifying international growth  continuing the value-over-volumes strategy  and completing the restructuring programme. The biggest contributors to value creation were international development and the streamlining of overheads.On the other hand  the Group was hardly hit by a tough external environment in 2022: the unprecedented surge in raw material and energy costs and patchy availability of supplies restricted our capacity to meet customer demand and eroded margins. Nevertheless  we remained on track thanks to the hard work put in by all our teams.This situation persists in 2023  and our major challenges this year will again be to deal with these external factors: the price list increase policy to mitigate the effects of inflation  the availability of raw materials and the impact on our customers‚Äô purchasing power. All of which leads us to take a prudent approach in the short and medium term  while maintaining our mainstream positioning and the quality of our products  a winning combination for our consumers in inflationary times.‚ÄùStory continuesSimplified income statement - FY 2022(‚Ç¨m except EPS) 2021 2022 Change 2022/2021 Net revenues (excluding excise duties) 166.7 181.4 +14.7 Gross margin 68.6 70.9 +2.3 Gross margin ratio 41.1% 39.1% EBITDA 12.6 11.8 -0.8 EBITDA margin 7.5% 6.5% Recurring operating profit 5.7 7.1 +1.4 Net profit/(loss) Group share 5.6 (0.9) -6.5 of which Net profit/(loss) from continuing operations  Group share 6.6 (0.9) -7.5 of which Net profit/(loss) from discontinued operations (1.0) - +1.0 Earnings per share  Group share (EPS  ‚Ç¨) 0.06 (0.01) -0.07 Earnings per share from continuing operations  Group share (EPS  ‚Ç¨) 0.06 (0.01) -0.07In 2022  the Group generated sales of ‚Ç¨181.4m  up 7.8% on the prior year  excluding currency impacts. 2022 was marked by a rise in revenues for both clusters  with growth has been stronger in the international cluster.The consolidated gross margin ratio fell 2 percentage points to 39.1% in 2022  as inflation pushed up materials and energy prices all year  rises that were only partly offset by raising prices in the international cluster. This ratio also reflects the dilutive impact of the Company‚Äôs stated target of offsetting the value of rising input costs by price increases in absolute value. The France cluster saw EBITDA decline by ‚Ç¨4.0m  partly due to base effects in 2021  when MBWS France recorded the aforementioned non-recurring ‚Ç¨3.1m supplier discount. Also  the fast rising costs of raw materials and energy in 2022  exacerbated by the Russia-Ukraine war  could not be fully passed on to selling prices.EBITDA for the international cluster rose by ‚Ç¨0.7m (excluding currency impact)  driven by strong performances in the Baltic States  direct International Export  Spain and Scandinavia. EBITDA in the United States (excluding currency impact) fell and was particularly hard hit by a highly competitive vodka market.

The fourth quarter fall in revenues was caused by the restricted availability and inflating prices of inputs. This led to problems meeting the demand of all our customers  forcing us to adapt pricing policies and scale back promotions. Despite these factors  the off-trade business held up well  driven in particular by sales of William Peel  which grew in the second half despite an environment of shortages and logistical problems that caused supply chain interruptions among competitors  and a spirits market which again declined compared to the same period in 2021. Full-year on-trade sales were much stronger in 2022 than in 2021  which had still been impacted by Covid restrictions.As a reminder  2021 EBITDA was boosted by a one-off ‚Ç¨3.1m credit note that the Group received from a whisky supplier under a new contract signed in January 2021. Overall  2022 EBITDA for the France cluster fell to ‚Ç¨8.4m from ‚Ç¨12.4m in 2021.INTERNATIONAL CLUSTER:International revenues grew significantly in 2022  up 11.7% versus 2021  with disparities between regions:- growth in Europe  particularly in the Bulgarian and Lithuanian domestic markets despite the Russia-Ukraine conflict  and in Spain;- a fall-off in Sobieski revenues in the United States  a highly competitive vodka market with heavy promotional pressure;- a solid performance by all Group strategic brands  particularly Marie Brizard and Cognac Gautier.EBITDA for the international cluster rose 8.1% (excluding currency impact) in 2022 to ‚Ç¨9.5m mainly driven by export markets and the European subsidiaries.- MBWS InternationalRevenues for the subsidiary totalled ‚Ç¨18.6m  up ‚Ç¨4m versus 2021 driven by strong performances in the French overseas territories  South Korea (+‚Ç¨0.7m) and Australia (+‚Ç¨0.8m) and by the Marie Brizard and Gautier brands.Western Europe export markets saw significant growth by William Peel in Belgium and Marie Brizard in Italy and the Middle East (Marie Brizard syrups)  partly offsetting struggling sales for Marie Brizard in the UK which hampered revenue growth for the region.In the Americas export market  Canada revenues rose 15.7% year-on-year. Growth was driven mainly by Gautier and Marie Brizard  while Sobieski vodka continues to struggle in a hotly contested market segment.Lastly  in Asia Pacific  the positive trend of the first nine months of 2022 was confirmed in the fourth quarter by sustained performances  notably in Taiwan.- MBWS Espa√±aRevenues amounted to ‚Ç¨21.1m  up ‚Ç¨1.1m.This represents a 5.6% rise in 2022 revenues versus 2021  driven mainly by solid performances from strategic brands (most notably Marie Brizard and William Peel) and stable trading in the subcontracting business.- MBWS ScandinaviaScandinavia posted a 25.3% increase in 2022 full-year revenues versus 2021  bolstered by the lifting of all Covid restrictions on the on-trade channel and driven again by sales of Marie Brizard  Sobieski and third-party brands.- MBWS BalticsThe Baltic States posted full-year revenues of ‚Ç¨26.4m  up 14.1%  including a fourth quarter upturn mainly due to brand performance driven by a proactive pricing policy  limited recovery in Ukraine and the continued buoyancy of the bulk market and its by-products.- MBWS BulgariaSales in Bulgaria continued to ramp up in the fourth quarter (Q4 up 22.8%  up 19.8% for the year) across the entire brand portfolio (spirits and wine) in both domestic and export markets thanks to a rigorous sales policy.The subsidiary posted revenues of ‚Ç¨16.8m  up ‚Ç¨2.8m.- Imperial BrandsIn the United States  revenues were down 9.3% year-on-year. The Sobieski brand was particularly hardly hit by an extremely competitive and shrinking vodka market and by changes made by our importer in some regional routes to market that are strategically important to the brand. These changes created operational  logistical and marketing issues that held back the brand‚Äôs performance.The Marie Brizard and Gautier brands confirmed their sales growth in this market in the fourth quarter  but had their own problems with some of the changes that were affecting Sobieski.- DubarBrazil had a mixed year  with a review of pricing policy across the whole portfolio at the start of the year which  however  successfully limited the decline. Revenues were down in the fourth quarter 2022 with a 16.7% drop in performance for the year  mainly due to delays in availability for certain strategic products.HOLDING COMPANY:EBITDA amounted to a ‚Ç¨6.0m loss in 2022 compared to a ‚Ç¨8.4m loss in 2021  reflecting the results of the 2021 restructuring and the ongoing drive to cut overheads.Balance sheet at 31 December 2022Shareholders‚Äô equity  Group share  was ‚Ç¨194.6m  compared to a restated2 ‚Ç¨193.3m at 31 December 2021. Net cash amounted to ‚Ç¨40.9m at 31 December 2022 compared to ‚Ç¨48.2m the previous year.These changes reflect the resumption of capital investment  the costs of restructuring the Off-trade sales department in France  scheduled payments under the CCSF plan (deferral of tax and social security payments agreed in April 2021) as well as the increase in the level of safety stocks (mainly for input categories subject to regular availability disruptions) and upward variations in their unit values (inflation).OutlookFor the past four years  the Group has maintained its strategic direction and the principle of prioritising operations that help improve the profitability of the Group‚Äôs businesses and significantly increase EBITDA.To achieve this growth in profitability  the Group is endeavouring to create the conditions for profitable development of its brand portfolio and key markets (subsidiaries and/or sales networks  direct export).Also  in all Group markets and subsidiaries  negotiations and marketing with customers systematically prioritise value over volumes  wherever possible.The Group now plans to accelerate the roll-out of its growth initiatives and projects in its France and International clusters  both organically and through mergers and acquisitions  so as to expand its trading base and improve financial performance.2022 operating earnings confirm the Group‚Äôs capacity to maintain the positive trends of the last two years (stripping out non-recurring items)  in a fast-changing local and global economic environment: pandemic  followed by bottlenecks in raw materials supplies and logistics  the Russia-Ukraine war threatening a further squeeze on product availability and the cost of inputs and energy  and some declining markets such as under-12-year blended Scotch whisky in France  vodkas in the USA  etc.These factors could potentially disrupt global business and have already led to a dilution in margins rates. Visibility remains low in some countries more heavily exposed to this changing scenario  such as the concentrated and increasingly mature French market where volumes are in sharp decline. For these reasons the Group is  for now  remaining highly prudent in its short and medium-term outlook.Financial calendar:Q1 2023 revenues: 27 April 2023General Meeting: 29 June 2023H1 2023 revenues: 27 July 2023Investors and shareholders relations contactMBWS GroupEmilie Drexlerrelations.actionnaires@mbws.comT√©l : +33 1 43 91 62 21 Press contactImage SeptClaire Doligez - Laurence Maurycdoligez@image7.fr ‚Äì lmaury@image7.frT√©l : +33 1 53 70 74 70About Marie Brizard Wine & SpiritsMarie Brizard Wine & Spirits is a Group of wines and spirits based in Europe and the United States.

From 1st January 2022  provisions on current assets are included in the definition of EBITDA which restated would have reached ‚Ç¨13.0m in 2021.2 In preparing its 2022 financial statements  the Company conducted an in-depth review of its deferred tax liabilities. It was found that their value in previous years had been overstated by ‚Ç¨19.7m. Almost all of this related to deferred taxes on the value of trademarks. Therefore  as required by IAS 8  the Company retrospectively restated all material differences in the comparative information published for 2021. As these adjustments derived from years prior to 2021  the technical correction was made in the opening statements for the 2021 financial year and led to a ‚Ç¨19.7m increase in shareholders‚Äô equity. This has no impact on cash or earnings for the period.Attachment,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.13,0.17,0.71,True,English,"['Marie Brizard Wine', 'FY 2022 Annual Results', 'Spirits', '‚Ç¨3.1m non-recurring credit note', 'non-recurring ‚Ç¨3.1m supplier discount', 'price list increase policy', 'persistent supplies availability pressure', '2021 LFL change Currency impact', 'Marie Brizard Wine', 'constant exchange rates', 'Chief Executive Officer', 'customers‚Äô purchasing power', 'rising input costs', 'fast rising costs', '2022 net profit Group share', 'two exceptional items', 'Simplified income statement', 'competitive vodka market', 'Recurring operating profit', 'direct International Export', 'Off-Trade sales department', 'revenue growth figures', 'tough external environment', 'current operating results', 'Gross margin ratio', 'The France cluster', 'non-recurring income', 'price increases', 'operating performance', 'exceptional expense', 'external factors', 'low-growth market', 'currency impacts', 'patchy availability', 'energy costs', 'dilutive impact', 'Net loss', 'tough year', 'international development', 'international growth', 'international cluster', 'inflationary context', 'one-off item', 'consolidation scope', 'audit procedures', 'Fahd Khadraoui', 'multiple fronts', 'volumes strategy', 'biggest contributors', 'other hand', 'unprecedented surge', 'raw material', 'customer demand', 'hard work', 'major challenges', 'prudent approach', 'medium term', 'mainstream positioning', 'winning combination', 'inflationary times', 'excise duties', 'continuing operations', 'discontinued operations', 'Russia-Ukraine war', 'strong performances', 'Baltic States', 'United States', 'economic volatility', 'Net revenues', '2022 financial year', 'prior year', 'MBWS France', '2022 full-year earnings', 'consolidated earnings', 'restructuring programme', 'base effects', 'HOLDING COMPANY', 'value creation', 'absolute value', 'TOTAL MBWS', 'EBITDA 1 definition', 'energy prices', 'materials', '1.0 Earnings', '2022 EBITDA', 'Spirits', 'Paris', '13 April', 'Resilience', 'restructurings', 'NB', 'Euronext', 'Board', 'Directors', '12 April', 'streamlining', 'overheads', 'capacity', 'margins', 'track', 'teams', 'situation', 'short', 'quality', 'products', 'consumers', 'Story', 'FY', 'EPS', 'rise', 'clusters', 'target', 'Spain', 'Scandinavia', 'Brazil', '7']",2023-04-13,2023-04-14,finance.yahoo.com

Revenue amounts to ‚Ç¨1.4 million  a 3.2-fold increase compared with the same period last year  thereby confirming the commercial strategy announced last year.

A summary of the consolidated financial statements is included further below.Pascal Prigent  CEO of GENFIT  commented:‚Äú2022 was a transformative year for GENFIT. It was marked by both the fast progression of our lead program and the expansion of our pipeline in rare and severe liver diseases  notably with the acquisition of Versantis AG. We are now approaching an inflection point: this quarter we expect to report data from our pivotal Phase 3 study in PBC. There is still an important unmet medical need in this market  and we are very encouraged by the previous Phase 2 data reported as part of this program. We believe elafibranor has significant potential  and we hope it will be demonstrated soon. Beyond this exciting milestone  we have built a rich pipeline  that now includes 3 additional phase 2-stage programs and 2 preclinical-stage programs. This pipeline  combined with a robust cash position and the near-term commercial perspectives for elafibranor  provide us with a unique opportunity to drive transformative value in 2023.‚ÄùStory continues2022 Key HighlightsPBC program executed according to planPatient enrollment for the ELATIVE¬Æ Phase 3 trial evaluating elafibranor in PBC was completed mid-2022. Throughout 2022 GENFIT and Ipsen stepped up their collaboration in order to minimize the time to filing as well as prepare for the commercial launch next year  if approved.Pipeline progressAcquisition of the clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company VersantisIn September 2022  GENFIT acquired clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company Versantis based in Zurich (Switzerland)  significantly expanding its pipeline. This acquisition has reinforced GENFIT‚Äôs position as a leader in ACLF and other severe liver diseases. Given the unmet need related to target diseases  it is expected that the programs qualify for some of the expedited regulatory pathways provided by health authorities.Two Pipeline Days were organized in October 2022 in Paris and New York  to present these programs in detail. A replay of these events is available here: https://ir.genfit.com/events/event-details/genfit-pipeline-day-nycAssessment of Nitazoxanide (NTZ) in hepatic and renal impaired patientsTwo Phase 1 studies were conducted  aimed at providing insight into NTZ pharmacokinetics and safety in the setting of hepatic impairment or renal impairment  in order to prepare for the launch of a Phase 2 study in ACLF in the second half of 2023.Orphan Drug Designation granted to GNS561 for the treatment of cholangiocarcinomaIn September 2022 the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Orphan Drug Designation to GNS561 (ezurpimtrostat)  a novel clinical-stage autophagy/PPT1 inhibitor  for the treatment of cholangiocarcinoma (CCA).Compelling results for NIS2+TM in NASHIn October 2022  GENFIT announced the development of NIS2+TM  a next-generation technology for the diagnosis of at-risk NASH  and the presentation of results on NIS2TM+‚Äôs clinical performance in three poster presentations at The Liver Meeting¬Æ 2022 organized by the AASLD2. The NIMBLE initiative of the FNIH3 highlighted in 2021 the strong and unique performance of NIS4¬Æ technology in identifying patients with at-risk NASH.II. 2023 Anticipated MilestonesTopline Phase 3 data for elafibranor in PBC: towards the end of 2Q23Topline results for the ELATIVE¬Æ study are now imminent and expected to be announced towards the end of the second quarter of 2023.Phase 2 results showed a statistically significant improvement on both the primary and composite biochemical evaluation criteria  the latter now being the primary endpoint of the pivotal Phase 3 trial to support accelerated approval. In addition  the results showed a positive trend on the improvement of pruritus  while preserving a favorable safety and tolerability profile. These positive conclusions were published in the Journal of Hepatology in 2021.4 Safety data derived from more than 1 000 patients in the biopsy-based Phase 3 RESOLVE-IT¬Æ trial of elafibranor in NASH also supported further development in PBC.Under the agreement with Ipsen  GENFIT is eligible to receive regulatory  commercial  and sales-based milestone payments up to ‚Ç¨360 million  with a potential first significant milestone payment as early as 2023 and an additional potential milestone payment in 2024  if ELATIVE¬Æ is successful. In addition  GENFIT is eligible for double-digit royalties of up to 20%. In the case of a positive trial outcome  the well-established global commercial footprint of Ipsen will be an important driver of commercial success. By 2024  if approved  elafibranor could potentially become a new therapeutic option for PBC patients not responding to UDCA5  and become the first alternative to currently approved second line treatment in a market estimated at $1.5bn in the coming years  and $3.1 billion in the US and in the five main European countries by 2030.6Additional clinical programs underway1st patient screening in a Phase 2 study evaluating VS-01 in ACLF: 2Q23An international Phase 2  open-label  randomized  controlled  multi-center  proof of concept study will assess the efficacy  safety and tolerability of VS-01 in addition to standard of care (SOC)  compared to SOC alone  in approximately 60 adult patients with ACLF grades 1 and 2 and who also have ascites. A Phase 1 trial highlighted the favorable safety and tolerability profile of VS-01 and provided encouraging preliminary efficacy results  with >80% of treated patients improving or stabilizing their disease (Child-Pugh Score assessment). It is anticipated that the first patient will be screened in this trial in the second quarter of 2023. Given the high unmet need in this indication and the Orphan Drug Designation obtained from the FDA for VS-01  it is expected that the program qualifies for some of the expedited regulatory pathways provided by health authorities.The overall market size of ACLF is estimated to be almost $4 billion in the US and in the five main European countries by 2030.7NTZ Phase 1 outcome in ACLF: May 2023GENFIT is developing a second program in ACLF in which it is evaluating NTZ. Two Phase 1 studies were completed in the fourth quarter of 2022 and the first quarter of 2023  and are expected to provide preliminary insight into NTZ pharmacokinetics and safety in the setting of hepatic impairment or renal impairment. Outcome of both the hepatic impairment study and the renal impairment study will be announced in May 2023. A Phase 2a proof of concept study in patients with ACLF grades 1 and 2 is currently under discussion with the FDA  and study initiation is targeted for the second half of 2023.1st patient screening in a Phase 1b/2a study evaluating GNS561 in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA): targeted towards the end of 2Q23A Phase 1b/2a trial will evaluate GNS561 in patients with advanced KRAS mutated CCA. In the Phase 1b  patients will be enrolled to evaluate the safety and tolerability of GNS561 when given in combination with a MEK inhibitor  and to identify the recommended doses of the combination to be administered in the Phase 2a study. GENFIT targets to screen the first patient towards the end of the second quarter of 2023. Given the high unmet need in this indication and the Orphan Drug Designation obtained from the FDA for GNS561  it is expected that the program qualifies for some of the expedited regulatory pathways provided by health authorities.The overall market size of CCA is estimated to be more than $3 billion in the US and in the five main European countries by 2030.8Preclinical programsIn addition to clinical programs  GENFIT is also pursuing the development of two preclinical programs:VS-01-HAC is a potential first-line lifesaving treatment for acute hyperammonemic crisis associated with Inborn Errors of Metabolism in Urea Cycle Disorders (UCD) and Organic Acidemias (OA). Investigational New Drug (IND) enabling nonclinical studies are targeted to be completed in 2024.VS-02-HE is developed in Hepatic Encephalopathy (HE)  which is one of the major complications of advanced liver disease and portal hypertension. As many as 45% of patients with cirrhosis will experience at least one episode of HE. VS-02-HE is a urease inhibitor  and a hydroxamic acid derivative  designed to inhibit ureases by binding to nickel atoms in their active site. IND enabling nonclinical studies are targeted to be completed in 2025.Although these are early-stage programs  they represent a significant potential due to the high unmet medical need. Market size for severe hepatic encephalopathy (HE) alone is estimated to be $3 billion in the US and in the five main European countries by 2030.9 For UCD and OA  estimations for 2030 go as high as $1.1 billion in the US and in the five main European countries.10III.

As such  of that initial ‚Ç¨40m in the deferred revenue balance  ‚Ç¨15.9m was recognized as revenue in 2022.‚Ç¨3.3 million was recognized as revenue in 2022 in accordance with the Inventory Purchase Agreement signed with Ipsen  pursuant to which Ipsen purchased inventory of elafibranor active pharmaceutical ingredient and drug product during the second half of 2022  with the prospect of transferring the conduct of the ELATIVE¬Æ study to Ipsen.‚Ç¨1.0 million in revenue was generated from the services rendered by GENFIT to Ipsen in accordance with the Transition Services Agreement signed in 2022  which essentially outlines the scope of services to facilitate the transition of some activities related to the Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating elafibranor in PBC.In 2022  other operating income totaled ‚Ç¨6.4 million. This included mainly the research tax credit (known as Cr√©dit d‚ÄôImp√¥t Recherche or CIR) granted by the French tax authorities  which amounted to ‚Ç¨6.0m. This is up from ‚Ç¨5.3 million for 2021. This is due to an increase in our research activities in 2022.Operating results and expensesOperating expenses for 2022 amounted to ‚Ç¨53.9 million  compared to ‚Ç¨53.8 million for 2021. This is comprised of research and development expenses  general and administrative expenses  marketing and market access expenses  reorganization and restructuring expenses  and other operating expenses.The slight increase is due to multiple factors:The increase in research and development costs of ‚Ç¨0.6 million  explained by the increase in costs related to new programs and product candidates  in particular NTZ  VS-01 and GNS561  offset by the sharp reduction in study costs related to RESOLVE-IT¬Æ The increase in general and administrative expenses of ‚Ç¨0.2 million  explained by the increase in costs related to liability insurance  the increase in costs related to consulting fees  and other charges in the normal course of business The decrease in marketing and market access expenses of ‚Ç¨0.5 million  mainly explained by the decrease in marketing activity in the United States and France The decrease in reorganization and restructuring charges of ‚Ç¨0.1 million (effectively null in 2022)  and the decrease of other operating expenses of ‚Ç¨0.1 million.In 2022  GENFIT generated a consolidated operating loss of ‚Ç¨27.3 million  compared to an operating income of ‚Ç¨31.8 million in 2021.Financial results2022 resulted in a financial income of ‚Ç¨3.5 million compared to a financial income of ‚Ç¨37.7 million in 2021.In 2022  financial income is due to net foreign exchange gains of ‚Ç¨7.1 million  interest income of ‚Ç¨0.7 million  offset by interest expense of ‚Ç¨4.3 million.In 2021  financial income was due to net foreign exchange gains of ‚Ç¨6.7 million  interest income of ‚Ç¨0.3 million  offset by interest expense of ‚Ç¨4.9 million. In addition  the company recorded a one time gain of 35.6 million corresponding to a repurchase bonus following the renegotiation of the OCEANEs in January 2021.The foreign exchange result on cash and cash equivalents was a net gain of ‚Ç¨7.1 million in 2022  compared to ‚Ç¨6.7 million in 2021. This is notably due to the difference in currency exchange recognized on cash and other current financial assets in US dollars  as GENFIT has decided to keep some of its cash in US dollars. These cash and other current financial assets in US dollars are to be used to pay directly expenses in US dollars (natural currency hedge).Cash positionAs of December 31  2022  the Company‚Äôs cash and cash equivalents and current financial assets amounted to ‚Ç¨140.6 million compared with ‚Ç¨258.8 million as of December 31  2021.This is mainly the result of the following  in addition to normal business activity:The payment of ‚Ç¨24.0 million in January 2022 representing the VAT collected on the initial upfront payment received from Ipsen in December 2021 The disbursement of employee participation in the profits of GENFIT SA in May 2022 for a total of ‚Ç¨0.6 million for the financial year 2021  andThe acquisition of Versantis AG totaling ‚Ç¨41.5m net of cash acquired.GENFIT will host a conference call in English and in French on April 14  2023 at 8.00am ET / 1:00pm GMT / 2:00pm CETBoth the English and French conference calls will be accessible on the investor page of our website  under the ‚ÄòEvents and presentation‚Äô section at https://ir.genfit.com or by calling 888-394-8218 (toll-free U.S and Canada)  0800-279-0425 (toll-free UK) or 0805 101 219 (toll-free France) five minutes prior to the start time (confirmation code: 8860599).

This marks a return to hyper-growth rates comparable to those achieved in the pre-COVID years  despite the ongoing negative impact of Russia on the first quarter and the continuing sustained development of our subscription model  which has affected revenue recognition in the short term while guaranteeing the Group a recurring revenue flow and better financial visibility over the coming years. As a reminder  WALLIX has multiplied its turnover by 12 in ten years  representing an average annual growth rate of nearly 30%.In line with our 2023 roadmap focused on innovation and the enhancement of the offering  we recently launched SaaS Remote Access  the SaaS version of our remote access management technology combined with our PAM4ALL solution. This solution allows any organization to manage secure digital access simply and globally for external service providers  as well as remote access. Another major milestone this quarter was the ramp-up of Group operations in the area of cloud infrastructure security and compliance thanks to our tech alliance with Kleverware. The goal of this alliance is to help organizations in their digital transformation towards cloud services by offering them a CIEM (Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management) solution. This development is a solid growth driver insofar as it targets the cloud services market estimated at $600 billion and growing 20% per year.WALLIX is pursuing its ambition of building a responsible digital world by helping organizations step up their secure-by-design digital transformation. After this strong start to the year  we are confident in the Company's business momentum  which still harbors growth potential  and in our ability to pursue this organic trend while developing our positioning on buoyant cybersecurity markets.‚ÄùSignificant first quarter recovery and growth upswing in recurring businessGrowth accelerated in the first quarter with turnover of ‚Ç¨6.1 million  up 30.3% versus Q1 2022 despite the impact of Russia  which posted sustained sales until the end of February 2022  and the shift towards a subscription-based business model.Monthly recurring revenue (MRR) for the first quarter totaled ‚Ç¨1.3 million  up 26.5% versus Q1 2022  representing ‚Ç¨15.4 million in recurring business on an annual basis. As such  WALLIX has started 2023 with a level of annual recurring business equivalent to 61.3% of 2022 consolidated turnover  up 8.6 percentage points year-on-year.An eventful first quarterThe first quarter has confirmed the target of accelerating organic growth for 2023 announced by the Group in its 2022 annual results press release. This momentum will be strengthened over the coming months by the recent initiatives focusing on cloud infrastructure and remote access.As such  in order to meet the challenges of cloud security  WALLIX has signed a strategic alliance with Kleverware  a European specialist in digital access and identity governance. By integrating their respective technologies  Privileged Access Management and Identity Access Governance  WALLIX and Kleverware offer a comprehensive CIEM (Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management) solution that maps  manages and safeguards all access - by humans or machines - to IT resources in the cloud while ensuring regulatory compliance. The strategic value of this alliance is enhanced by the fact that CIEM technology is emerging as the go-to standard for access management and application of the ‚Äúleast privilege‚Äù principle in cloud infrastructures.Most recently  the Group also announced the launch of its SaaS Remote Access solution  the SaaS version of the remote access management technology integrated into the WALLIX PAM4ALL comprehensive solution  enabling the optimization of remote access management  especially for external partners.The launch of SaaS Remote Access and the tech alliance with Kleverware are fully in line with WALLIX's strategy of developing and enhancing its offering and solutions while generating a rapid impact on the Group's outlook.WALLIX reaffirms its ambition to significantly improve earnings via a gradual return to normal operating expenses in order to reach operating breakeven by 2024.Next publication: H1 2023 turnover  July 20  2023A PROPOS DE WALLIX√âditeur de logiciels de cybers√©curit√©  WALLIX est le sp√©cialiste europ√©en de la s√©curisation des acc√®s et des identit√©s num√©riques  leader mondial du PAM  le Privileged Access Management.

Our aim is to give young people in Southern Italy the chance to establish their professional future near their homes in a rapidly expanding and sustainable industry by providing specialized training in wind farm maintenance"".Francesco Amati  General Manager of Vestas Italy and Turkey  says: ""We are really proud to be part of this initiative and we are also very glad to implement it for the first time in the South of Italy together with our partner EDPR. In the past two years  Keep it Local has showcased the role that wind energy can play not only in the fight against climate change  but in creating long-term  sustainable jobs in rural areas.""Application is open to candidates aged between 18 and 30 who live in geographical areas such as Campania  Apulia  Molise  Basilicata  Sicily  Calabria and Sardinia where both companies have a presence through wind farms  provided they have completed their compulsory secondary education.Candidates must submit their application by April 28  2023 by completing the form here.

It should be noted that growth in France remained brisk  in the double digits.The share of Software & Services represented 14% of quarterly revenue  versus 15% in FY 2022  considering a particularly high basis for comparison (up +64% in Q1 2022).Record sales growth in North America: +86%  representing 30% of revenueThis past quarter was characterized by similar growth in France and international business  amounting to +15%.The share of international activity accounted for 67% of revenue in Q1 2023  compared to 64% for FY 2022.In North America  Ekinops achieved record quarterly growth of +86% in Q1 2023 (+79% in US dollars). For the first time  on a quarterly basis  this region represented 30% of Group sales. This vigorous momentum was underpinned by highly sustained growth for Optical Transport solutions  including significant deliveries to an important US service provider that covers 16 states and selected Ekinops to scale and level up the reliability of its fiber network.EMEA (Europe  excluding France  the Middle-East and Africa)  which represents 34% of the Group's activity  posted a decline of -7% in its quarterly sales. Considering the basis for comparison (up +21% in Q1 2022)  this trend is not indicative of the growth levels expected for the region on a full-year basis.Asia-Pacific reported a -40% decline which is also immaterial since it follows a +113% increase in sales over Q1 2022. Asia-Pacific accounted for 3% of the quarter's business volumes.Lastly  in line with FY 2022  Ekinops continued to generate sharp growth in France. Sales increased steadily by +15% in the domestic market  representing 33% of quarterly revenue. This trend reflects the double-digit growth posted for Optical Transport and Access solutions alike in France.2023 guidance confirmedEkinops has made an excellent start to FY 2023 and confirms its 2023 financial targets:revenue growth of more than +12% ;; EBITDA margin between 15% and 19%  including human and technological investments to support its growth.In terms of external growth  Ekinops reaffirms its ambition to complete at least one transaction during the year  favoring a non-dilutive source of financing.All press releases are published after Euronext Paris market close.More information on Ekinops website: https://www.ekinops.com/All press releases are published after the close of trading on Euronext Paris.EKINOPS ContactDidier Br√©dyChairman and CEO[email protected]InvestorsMathieu OmnesInvestor relationTel.: +33 (0)1 53 67 36 92[email protected]Logo: https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/814911/Ekinops_Logo.jpgSOURCE Ekinops,neutral,0.0,0.99,0.0,positive,0.79,0.2,0.0,True,English,"['9m revenue', 'Ekinops', 'important US service provider', 'constant exchange rates', 'Didier Br√©dy', 'first three months', 'Optical Transport solutions', 'Optical Transport activity', 'record quarterly growth', 'Euronext Paris market', 'Record sales growth', 'US dollars', 'domestic market', 'first time', 'telecommunications solutions', 'Access solutions', 'leading supplier', 'telecom operators', 'audited data', 'solid performance', 'business lines', 'continued success', 'WDM systems', 'double digits', 'North America', 'international business', 'international activity', 'vigorous momentum', 'significant deliveries', 'fiber network', 'business volumes', 'excellent start', '2023 financial targets', 'EBITDA margin', 'technological investments', 'one transaction', 'dilutive source', 'press releases', 'More information', 'Mathieu Omnes', 'Investor relation', 'quarterly basis', 'quarterly sales', 'quarterly revenue', 'full-year basis', 'high basis', 'consolidated revenue', 'first quarter', 'strong growth', 'similar growth', 'growth levels', 'sharp growth', 'double-digit growth', 'external growth', 'annual guidance', '+12% revenue growth', 'past quarter', 'Group sales', 'Ekinops website', 'EKINOPS Contact', 'SOURCE Ekinops', 'Q1 revenue', '+15% growth', '+20% growth', '2023 guidance', 'April', 'PRNewswire', 'enterprises', 'January', 'March', 'IFRS', 'end', 'FY', 'back', 'continuity', 'France', 'share', 'Software', 'Services', 'comparison', 'region', '16 states', 'reliability', 'EMEA', 'Europe', 'Middle-East', 'Africa', 'decline', 'Asia-Pacific', '+113% increase', 'human', 'terms', 'ambition', 'financing', 'close', 'trading', 'Chairman', 'CEO', 'Investors', 'Tel.', 'Logo', '33']",2023-04-13,2023-04-14,prnewswire.com

At the start of this year  Bloomberg New Energy Finance reported that global investment had reached a total of $1.1 trillion in 2022 (up 31% from $849 billion in 2021)  as the energy crisis and policy action drove faster deployment of clean energy technologies  especially renewables and electric vehicles. This has meant that CO2 emissions from energy in 2022 grew only 1% on the previous year to 33.8 billion tonnes. For the first time  investment in low-carbon technologies reached parity with capital deployed in support of fossil fuels. Furthermore  demand-side climate transition investment at $561 billion exceeded for the first time supply-side investment at $550 billion  with investment in electrified transport receiving nearly as much capital as renewable energy. BNEF's data show that China was by far the leading destination for attracting energy transition investment  accounting for $546 billion while the EU as a bloc came second at $141 billion. Investment in Europe was led by Germany ($55 billion)  France ($29 billion) and the UK ($28 billion). Focusing back on our own business  the Climate Transition Capital team started the new year in a promising position with an exclusive agreement to merge with an attractive target company. However  the team was unable to steer this opportunity to a successful conclusion  despite everyone's best efforts  and has terminated the exclusivity. At the time of writing  the team continues to work through all of its other potential opportunities. The Company's chances of concluding a successful transaction are partly a function of time and there is now a very limited window remaining. Furthermore  the very difficult market conditions throughout 2022 have been further aggravated by the recent turmoil in the global banking system. In recognition of these realities  some of the European SPACs that listed just weeks ahead of us have made the decision to go into liquidation. We will continue to look at options with the remaining time available. It is to be very much hoped that the global investor community can soon find the confidence and conviction to sustain climate transition investments at the levels needed to secure net-zero  with all the social  environmental and economic benefits that would bring. Marieke Bax Chair  Climate Transition Capital Acquisition I B.V. 2Directors' Report OVERVIEW OF THE COMPANY AND THE GROUP Climate Transition Capital Acquisition I B.V. (""CTCA1"" or the ""Company"") is a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) incorporated by Climate Transition Capital Sponsor I LLP (the ""Sponsor"") for the purpose of effecting a merger  capital stock exchange  asset acquisition  stock purchase  reorganisation or similar business combination with or acquisition of a target business or entity (a ""Business Combination""). On 29 June 2021 the Company successfully completed a private placement of 19 000 000 ""Units""  each entitling the holder to one Ordinary Share and one-third of a Warrant  at a price of ‚Ç¨10.00 per Unit raising ‚Ç¨190 million (the ""Offering""). The resulting Units were admitted to listing and trading on Euronext Amsterdam. During a ""stabilisation period"" which ended on 8 July 2021  39 000 Units were repurchased then cancelled leaving issued Units of 18 961 000 (entitling the holders to 18 961 000 Ordinary Shares and 6 320 333 Warrants). On 4 August 2021  35 calendar days after the first day of trading  the Units split into Ordinary Shares and Warrants which have been separately listed and traded on Euronext Amsterdam since. 100% of the proceeds of the Offering plus ‚Ç¨2 million to cover up to ‚Ç¨2 million of negative interest (the ""Negative Interest Cover"") have been put into a bank account opened by Stichting Climate Transition Capital Escrow (the ""Foundation"") and held with ABN AMRO Bank N.V. in the Netherlands (the ""Escrow Account""). These amounts will only be released in accordance with the terms of an escrow agreement  the key terms of which are summarised below. In the event of a Business Combination  the Company may use all or a substantial part of the amounts held in the Escrow Account to:o pay the consideration due for the Business Combination  the transaction costs associated with the Business Combination and additional Offering underwriting fees due upon completion of a Business Combination;o repurchase Ordinary Shares in accordance with share repurchase arrangements detailed in the Prospectus (see below);o the Company may apply the balance of the cash  if any  released from the Escrow Account for general corporate purposes of the target business  including for maintenance or expansion of operations thereof.pay the consideration due for the Business Combination  the transaction costs associated with the Business Combination and additional Offering underwriting fees due upon completion of a Business Combination; repurchase Ordinary Shares in accordance with share repurchase arrangements detailed in the Prospectus (see below); the Company may apply the balance of the cash  if any  released from the Escrow Account for general corporate purposes of the target business  including for maintenance or expansion of operations thereof. In the event no Business Combination completes within 24 months from the settlement date of 2 July 2021 (the "" Business Combination Deadline "")  the Company will use the amounts held in the Escrow Account (minus any negative interest due in excess of ‚Ç¨2 million) to repurchase Ordinary Shares under the Share Repurchase Arrangement and otherwise  for those who do not elect to participate in the Share Repurchase Arrangement  to distribute in accordance with the Liquidation Waterfall. The Foundation is ultimately controlled by the Company and is therefore its subsidiary. The Company and the Foundation together comprise the ""Group"".

Restating these two exceptional items  2022 net profit Group share would would be slightly lower than in 2021NB: All revenue growth figures reported herein are at constant exchange rates and consolidation scope  unless otherwise stated. Marie Brizard Wine & Spirits (Euronext: MBWS) today announces its consolidated earnings for the 2022 financial year as approved by the Group‚Äôs Board of Directors on 12 April 2023. All audit procedures have been carried out. Commenting on these results  Fahd Khadraoui  Chief Executive Officer of Marie Brizard Wine & Spirits  said: ‚ÄúThe Group continued to improve its operating performance in 2022. During the year  we successfully created value by working on multiple fronts: intensifying international growth  continuing the value-over-volumes strategy  and completing the restructuring programme. The biggest contributors to value creation were international development and the streamlining of overheads.On the other hand  the Group was hardly hit by a tough external environment in 2022: the unprecedented surge in raw material and energy costs and patchy availability of supplies restricted our capacity to meet customer demand and eroded margins. Nevertheless  we remained on track thanks to the hard work put in by all our teams.This situation persists in 2023  and our major challenges this year will again be to deal with these external factors: the price list increase policy to mitigate the effects of inflation  the availability of raw materials and the impact on our customers‚Äô purchasing power. All of which leads us to take a prudent approach in the short and medium term  while maintaining our mainstream positioning and the quality of our products  a winning combination for our consumers in inflationary times.‚Äù Simplified income statement - FY 2022 (‚Ç¨m except EPS) 2021 2022 Change 2022/2021 Net revenues (excluding excise duties) 166.7 181.4 +14.7 Gross margin 68.6 70.9 +2.3 Gross margin ratio 41.1% 39.1% EBITDA 12.6 11.8 -0.8 EBITDA margin 7.5% 6.5% Recurring operating profit 5.7 7.1 +1.4 Net profit/(loss) Group share 5.6 (0.9) -6.5 of which Net profit/(loss) from continuing operations  Group share 6.6 (0.9) -7.5 of which Net profit/(loss) from discontinued operations (1.0) - +1.0 Earnings per share  Group share (EPS  ‚Ç¨) 0.06 (0.01) -0.07 Earnings per share from continuing operations  Group share (EPS  ‚Ç¨) 0.06 (0.01) -0.07 In 2022  the Group generated sales of ‚Ç¨181.4m  up 7.8% on the prior year  excluding currency impacts. 2022 was marked by a rise in revenues for both clusters  with growth has been stronger in the international cluster. The consolidated gross margin ratio fell 2 percentage points to 39.1% in 2022  as inflation pushed up materials and energy prices all year  rises that were only partly offset by raising prices in the international cluster. This ratio also reflects the dilutive impact of the Company‚Äôs stated target of offsetting the value of rising input costs by price increases in absolute value. The France cluster saw EBITDA decline by ‚Ç¨4.0m  partly due to base effects in 2021  when MBWS France recorded the aforementioned non-recurring ‚Ç¨3.1m supplier discount. Also  the fast rising costs of raw materials and energy in 2022  exacerbated by the Russia-Ukraine war  could not be fully passed on to selling prices.EBITDA for the international cluster rose by ‚Ç¨0.7m (excluding currency impact)  driven by strong performances in the Baltic States  direct International Export  Spain and Scandinavia. EBITDA in the United States (excluding currency impact) fell and was particularly hard hit by a highly competitive vodka market. Brazil had a tough year in a low-growth market suffering economic volatility. 2022 net revenues by cluster (‚Ç¨m) 2021 LFL change Currencyimpact 2022LFL change(excl. currency impact) Change (incl.currency impact) FRANCE CLUSTER 78.6 +2.7 - 81.3 +3.4% +3.4% INTERNATIONAL CLUSTER 88.1 +10.4 +1.6 100.1 +11.7% +13.6% TOTAL MBWS 166.7 +13.1 +1.6 181.4 +7.8% +8.8% 2022 EBITDA by cluster (‚Ç¨m) 2021 LFL change Currencyimpact 2022LFL change(excl. currency impact) Change (incl.currency impact) FRANCE CLUSTER 12.4 -4.0 - 8.4 -32.1% -32.1% INTERNATIONAL CLUSTER 8.6 +0.7 +0.2 9.5 +8.1% +10.2% HOLDING COMPANY (8.4) +2.3 - (6.1) +27.8% +27.8% TOTAL MBWS 12.6 -1.0 +0.2 11.8 -7.5% -6.1% FRANCE CLUSTER: In France  despite a 4.0% decline in the fourth quarter  revenues grew by 3.4% for 2022 as a whole versus 2021  mainly due to the strong performance of our strategic brands and the effect of general inflation on the trading environment. The fourth quarter fall in revenues was caused by the restricted availability and inflating prices of inputs. This led to problems meeting the demand of all our customers  forcing us to adapt pricing policies and scale back promotions. Despite these factors  the off-trade business held up well  driven in particular by sales of William Peel  which grew in the second half despite an environment of shortages and logistical problems that caused supply chain interruptions among competitors  and a spirits market which again declined compared to the same period in 2021. Full-year on-trade sales were much stronger in 2022 than in 2021  which had still been impacted by Covid restrictions. As a reminder  2021 EBITDA was boosted by a one-off ‚Ç¨3.1m credit note that the Group received from a whisky supplier under a new contract signed in January 2021. Overall  2022 EBITDA for the France cluster fell to ‚Ç¨8.4m from ‚Ç¨12.4m in 2021. INTERNATIONAL CLUSTER: International revenues grew significantly in 2022  up 11.7% versus 2021  with disparities between regions:- growth in Europe  particularly in the Bulgarian and Lithuanian domestic markets despite the Russia-Ukraine conflict  and in Spain;- a fall-off in Sobieski revenues in the United States  a highly competitive vodka market with heavy promotional pressure;- a solid performance by all Group strategic brands  particularly Marie Brizard and Cognac Gautier.EBITDA for the international cluster rose 8.1% (excluding currency impact) in 2022 to ‚Ç¨9.5m mainly driven by export markets and the European subsidiaries.- MBWS International Revenues for the subsidiary totalled ‚Ç¨18.6m  up ‚Ç¨4m versus 2021 driven by strong performances in the French overseas territories  South Korea (+‚Ç¨0.7m) and Australia (+‚Ç¨0.8m) and by the Marie Brizard and Gautier brands.Western Europe export markets saw significant growth by William Peel in Belgium and Marie Brizard in Italy and the Middle East (Marie Brizard syrups)  partly offsetting struggling sales for Marie Brizard in the UK which hampered revenue growth for the region.In the Americas export market  Canada revenues rose 15.7% year-on-year. Growth was driven mainly by Gautier and Marie Brizard  while Sobieski vodka continues to struggle in a hotly contested market segment.Lastly  in Asia Pacific  the positive trend of the first nine months of 2022 was confirmed in the fourth quarter by sustained performances  notably in Taiwan.- MBWS Espa√±aRevenues amounted to ‚Ç¨21.1m  up ‚Ç¨1.1m.This represents a 5.6% rise in 2022 revenues versus 2021  driven mainly by solid performances from strategic brands (most notably Marie Brizard and William Peel) and stable trading in the subcontracting business.- MBWS ScandinaviaScandinavia posted a 25.3% increase in 2022 full-year revenues versus 2021  bolstered by the lifting of all Covid restrictions on the on-trade channel and driven again by sales of Marie Brizard  Sobieski and third-party brands.- MBWS BalticsThe Baltic States posted full-year revenues of ‚Ç¨26.4m  up 14.1%  including a fourth quarter upturn mainly due to brand performance driven by a proactive pricing policy  limited recovery in Ukraine and the continued buoyancy of the bulk market and its by-products.- MBWS BulgariaSales in Bulgaria continued to ramp up in the fourth quarter (Q4 up 22.8%  up 19.8% for the year) across the entire brand portfolio (spirits and wine) in both domestic and export markets thanks to a rigorous sales policy.The subsidiary posted revenues of ‚Ç¨16.8m  up ‚Ç¨2.8m.- Imperial BrandsIn the United States  revenues were down 9.3% year-on-year. The Sobieski brand was particularly hardly hit by an extremely competitive and shrinking vodka market and by changes made by our importer in some regional routes to market that are strategically important to the brand. These changes created operational  logistical and marketing issues that held back the brand‚Äôs performance.The Marie Brizard and Gautier brands confirmed their sales growth in this market in the fourth quarter  but had their own problems with some of the changes that were affecting Sobieski.- DubarBrazil had a mixed year  with a review of pricing policy across the whole portfolio at the start of the year which  however  successfully limited the decline. Revenues were down in the fourth quarter 2022 with a 16.7% drop in performance for the year  mainly due to delays in availability for certain strategic products.HOLDING COMPANY: EBITDA amounted to a ‚Ç¨6.0m loss in 2022 compared to a ‚Ç¨8.4m loss in 2021  reflecting the results of the 2021 restructuring and the ongoing drive to cut overheads.Balance sheet at 31 December 2022 Shareholders‚Äô equity  Group share  was ‚Ç¨194.6m  compared to a restated2 ‚Ç¨193.3m at 31 December 2021. Net cash amounted to ‚Ç¨40.9m at 31 December 2022 compared to ‚Ç¨48.2m the previous year. These changes reflect the resumption of capital investment  the costs of restructuring the Off-trade sales department in France  scheduled payments under the CCSF plan (deferral of tax and social security payments agreed in April 2021) as well as the increase in the level of safety stocks (mainly for input categories subject to regular availability disruptions) and upward variations in their unit values (inflation). Outlook For the past four years  the Group has maintained its strategic direction and the principle of prioritising operations that help improve the profitability of the Group‚Äôs businesses and significantly increase EBITDA. To achieve this growth in profitability  the Group is endeavouring to create the conditions for profitable development of its brand portfolio and key markets (subsidiaries and/or sales networks  direct export). Also  in all Group markets and subsidiaries  negotiations and marketing with customers systematically prioritise value over volumes  wherever possible. The Group now plans to accelerate the roll-out of its growth initiatives and projects in its France and International clusters  both organically and through mergers and acquisitions  so as to expand its trading base and improve financial performance. 2022 operating earnings confirm the Group‚Äôs capacity to maintain the positive trends of the last two years (stripping out non-recurring items)  in a fast-changing local and global economic environment: pandemic  followed by bottlenecks in raw materials supplies and logistics  the Russia-Ukraine war threatening a further squeeze on product availability and the cost of inputs and energy  and some declining markets such as under-12-year blended Scotch whisky in France  vodkas in the USA  etc. These factors could potentially disrupt global business and have already led to a dilution in margins rates. Visibility remains low in some countries more heavily exposed to this changing scenario  such as the concentrated and increasingly mature French market where volumes are in sharp decline. For these reasons the Group is  for now  remaining highly prudent in its short and medium-term outlook.

From 1st January 2022  provisions on current assets are included in the definition of EBITDA which restated would have reached ‚Ç¨13.0m in 2021.2 In preparing its 2022 financial statements  the Company conducted an in-depth review of its deferred tax liabilities. It was found that their value in previous years had been overstated by ‚Ç¨19.7m. Almost all of this related to deferred taxes on the value of trademarks. Therefore  as required by IAS 8  the Company retrospectively restated all material differences in the comparative information published for 2021. As these adjustments derived from years prior to 2021  the technical correction was made in the opening statements for the 2021 financial year and led to a ‚Ç¨19.7m increase in shareholders‚Äô equity. This has no impact on cash or earnings for the period.

Restating these two exceptional items  2022 net profit Group share would would be slightly lower than in 2021NB: All revenue growth figures reported herein are at constant exchange rates and consolidation scope  unless otherwise stated. Marie Brizard Wine & Spirits (Euronext: MBWS) today announces its consolidated earnings for the 2022 financial year as approved by the Group‚Äôs Board of Directors on 12 April 2023. All audit procedures have been carried out. Commenting on these results  Fahd Khadraoui  Chief Executive Officer of Marie Brizard Wine & Spirits  said: ‚ÄúThe Group continued to improve its operating performance in 2022. During the year  we successfully created value by working on multiple fronts: intensifying international growth  continuing the value-over-volumes strategy  and completing the restructuring programme. The biggest contributors to value creation were international development and the streamlining of overheads.On the other hand  the Group was hardly hit by a tough external environment in 2022: the unprecedented surge in raw material and energy costs and patchy availability of supplies restricted our capacity to meet customer demand and eroded margins. Nevertheless  we remained on track thanks to the hard work put in by all our teams.This situation persists in 2023  and our major challenges this year will again be to deal with these external factors: the price list increase policy to mitigate the effects of inflation  the availability of raw materials and the impact on our customers‚Äô purchasing power. All of which leads us to take a prudent approach in the short and medium term  while maintaining our mainstream positioning and the quality of our products  a winning combination for our consumers in inflationary times.‚Äù Simplified income statement - FY 2022 (‚Ç¨m except EPS) 2021 2022 Change 2022/2021 Net revenues (excluding excise duties) 166.7 181.4 +14.7 Gross margin 68.6 70.9 +2.3 Gross margin ratio 41.1% 39.1% EBITDA 12.6 11.8 -0.8 EBITDA margin 7.5% 6.5% Recurring operating profit 5.7 7.1 +1.4 Net profit/(loss) Group share 5.6 (0.9) -6.5 of which Net profit/(loss) from continuing operations  Group share 6.6 (0.9) -7.5 of which Net profit/(loss) from discontinued operations (1.0) - +1.0 Earnings per share  Group share (EPS  ‚Ç¨) 0.06 (0.01) -0.07 Earnings per share from continuing operations  Group share (EPS  ‚Ç¨) 0.06 (0.01) -0.07 In 2022  the Group generated sales of ‚Ç¨181.4m  up 7.8% on the prior year  excluding currency impacts. 2022 was marked by a rise in revenues for both clusters  with growth has been stronger in the international cluster. The consolidated gross margin ratio fell 2 percentage points to 39.1% in 2022  as inflation pushed up materials and energy prices all year  rises that were only partly offset by raising prices in the international cluster. This ratio also reflects the dilutive impact of the Company‚Äôs stated target of offsetting the value of rising input costs by price increases in absolute value. The France cluster saw EBITDA decline by ‚Ç¨4.0m  partly due to base effects in 2021  when MBWS France recorded the aforementioned non-recurring ‚Ç¨3.1m supplier discount. Also  the fast rising costs of raw materials and energy in 2022  exacerbated by the Russia-Ukraine war  could not be fully passed on to selling prices.EBITDA for the international cluster rose by ‚Ç¨0.7m (excluding currency impact)  driven by strong performances in the Baltic States  direct International Export  Spain and Scandinavia. EBITDA in the United States (excluding currency impact) fell and was particularly hard hit by a highly competitive vodka market. Brazil had a tough year in a low-growth market suffering economic volatility. 2022 net revenues by cluster (‚Ç¨m) 2021 LFL change Currencyimpact 2022LFL change(excl. currency impact) Change (incl.currency impact) FRANCE CLUSTER 78.6 +2.7 - 81.3 +3.4% +3.4% INTERNATIONAL CLUSTER 88.1 +10.4 +1.6 100.1 +11.7% +13.6% TOTAL MBWS 166.7 +13.1 +1.6 181.4 +7.8% +8.8% 2022 EBITDA by cluster (‚Ç¨m) 2021 LFL change Currencyimpact 2022LFL change(excl. currency impact) Change (incl.currency impact) FRANCE CLUSTER 12.4 -4.0 - 8.4 -32.1% -32.1% INTERNATIONAL CLUSTER 8.6 +0.7 +0.2 9.5 +8.1% +10.2% HOLDING COMPANY (8.4) +2.3 - (6.1) +27.8% +27.8% TOTAL MBWS 12.6 -1.0 +0.2 11.8 -7.5% -6.1% FRANCE CLUSTER: In France  despite a 4.0% decline in the fourth quarter  revenues grew by 3.4% for 2022 as a whole versus 2021  mainly due to the strong performance of our strategic brands and the effect of general inflation on the trading environment. The fourth quarter fall in revenues was caused by the restricted availability and inflating prices of inputs. This led to problems meeting the demand of all our customers  forcing us to adapt pricing policies and scale back promotions. Despite these factors  the off-trade business held up well  driven in particular by sales of William Peel  which grew in the second half despite an environment of shortages and logistical problems that caused supply chain interruptions among competitors  and a spirits market which again declined compared to the same period in 2021. Full-year on-trade sales were much stronger in 2022 than in 2021  which had still been impacted by Covid restrictions. As a reminder  2021 EBITDA was boosted by a one-off ‚Ç¨3.1m credit note that the Group received from a whisky supplier under a new contract signed in January 2021. Overall  2022 EBITDA for the France cluster fell to ‚Ç¨8.4m from ‚Ç¨12.4m in 2021. INTERNATIONAL CLUSTER: International revenues grew significantly in 2022  up 11.7% versus 2021  with disparities between regions:- growth in Europe  particularly in the Bulgarian and Lithuanian domestic markets despite the Russia-Ukraine conflict  and in Spain;- a fall-off in Sobieski revenues in the United States  a highly competitive vodka market with heavy promotional pressure;- a solid performance by all Group strategic brands  particularly Marie Brizard and Cognac Gautier.EBITDA for the international cluster rose 8.1% (excluding currency impact) in 2022 to ‚Ç¨9.5m mainly driven by export markets and the European subsidiaries.- MBWS International Revenues for the subsidiary totalled ‚Ç¨18.6m  up ‚Ç¨4m versus 2021 driven by strong performances in the French overseas territories  South Korea (+‚Ç¨0.7m) and Australia (+‚Ç¨0.8m) and by the Marie Brizard and Gautier brands.Western Europe export markets saw significant growth by William Peel in Belgium and Marie Brizard in Italy and the Middle East (Marie Brizard syrups)  partly offsetting struggling sales for Marie Brizard in the UK which hampered revenue growth for the region.In the Americas export market  Canada revenues rose 15.7% year-on-year. Growth was driven mainly by Gautier and Marie Brizard  while Sobieski vodka continues to struggle in a hotly contested market segment.Lastly  in Asia Pacific  the positive trend of the first nine months of 2022 was confirmed in the fourth quarter by sustained performances  notably in Taiwan.- MBWS Espa√±aRevenues amounted to ‚Ç¨21.1m  up ‚Ç¨1.1m.This represents a 5.6% rise in 2022 revenues versus 2021  driven mainly by solid performances from strategic brands (most notably Marie Brizard and William Peel) and stable trading in the subcontracting business.- MBWS ScandinaviaScandinavia posted a 25.3% increase in 2022 full-year revenues versus 2021  bolstered by the lifting of all Covid restrictions on the on-trade channel and driven again by sales of Marie Brizard  Sobieski and third-party brands.- MBWS BalticsThe Baltic States posted full-year revenues of ‚Ç¨26.4m  up 14.1%  including a fourth quarter upturn mainly due to brand performance driven by a proactive pricing policy  limited recovery in Ukraine and the continued buoyancy of the bulk market and its by-products.- MBWS BulgariaSales in Bulgaria continued to ramp up in the fourth quarter (Q4 up 22.8%  up 19.8% for the year) across the entire brand portfolio (spirits and wine) in both domestic and export markets thanks to a rigorous sales policy.The subsidiary posted revenues of ‚Ç¨16.8m  up ‚Ç¨2.8m.- Imperial BrandsIn the United States  revenues were down 9.3% year-on-year. The Sobieski brand was particularly hardly hit by an extremely competitive and shrinking vodka market and by changes made by our importer in some regional routes to market that are strategically important to the brand. These changes created operational  logistical and marketing issues that held back the brand‚Äôs performance.The Marie Brizard and Gautier brands confirmed their sales growth in this market in the fourth quarter  but had their own problems with some of the changes that were affecting Sobieski.- DubarBrazil had a mixed year  with a review of pricing policy across the whole portfolio at the start of the year which  however  successfully limited the decline. Revenues were down in the fourth quarter 2022 with a 16.7% drop in performance for the year  mainly due to delays in availability for certain strategic products.HOLDING COMPANY: EBITDA amounted to a ‚Ç¨6.0m loss in 2022 compared to a ‚Ç¨8.4m loss in 2021  reflecting the results of the 2021 restructuring and the ongoing drive to cut overheads.Balance sheet at 31 December 2022 Shareholders‚Äô equity  Group share  was ‚Ç¨194.6m  compared to a restated2 ‚Ç¨193.3m at 31 December 2021. Net cash amounted to ‚Ç¨40.9m at 31 December 2022 compared to ‚Ç¨48.2m the previous year. These changes reflect the resumption of capital investment  the costs of restructuring the Off-trade sales department in France  scheduled payments under the CCSF plan (deferral of tax and social security payments agreed in April 2021) as well as the increase in the level of safety stocks (mainly for input categories subject to regular availability disruptions) and upward variations in their unit values (inflation). Outlook For the past four years  the Group has maintained its strategic direction and the principle of prioritising operations that help improve the profitability of the Group‚Äôs businesses and significantly increase EBITDA. To achieve this growth in profitability  the Group is endeavouring to create the conditions for profitable development of its brand portfolio and key markets (subsidiaries and/or sales networks  direct export). Also  in all Group markets and subsidiaries  negotiations and marketing with customers systematically prioritise value over volumes  wherever possible. The Group now plans to accelerate the roll-out of its growth initiatives and projects in its France and International clusters  both organically and through mergers and acquisitions  so as to expand its trading base and improve financial performance. 2022 operating earnings confirm the Group‚Äôs capacity to maintain the positive trends of the last two years (stripping out non-recurring items)  in a fast-changing local and global economic environment: pandemic  followed by bottlenecks in raw materials supplies and logistics  the Russia-Ukraine war threatening a further squeeze on product availability and the cost of inputs and energy  and some declining markets such as under-12-year blended Scotch whisky in France  vodkas in the USA  etc. These factors could potentially disrupt global business and have already led to a dilution in margins rates. Visibility remains low in some countries more heavily exposed to this changing scenario  such as the concentrated and increasingly mature French market where volumes are in sharp decline. For these reasons the Group is  for now  remaining highly prudent in its short and medium-term outlook.

From 1st January 2022  provisions on current assets are included in the definition of EBITDA which restated would have reached ‚Ç¨13.0m in 2021.2 In preparing its 2022 financial statements  the Company conducted an in-depth review of its deferred tax liabilities. It was found that their value in previous years had been overstated by ‚Ç¨19.7m. Almost all of this related to deferred taxes on the value of trademarks. Therefore  as required by IAS 8  the Company retrospectively restated all material differences in the comparative information published for 2021. As these adjustments derived from years prior to 2021  the technical correction was made in the opening statements for the 2021 financial year and led to a ‚Ç¨19.7m increase in shareholders‚Äô equity. This has no impact on cash or earnings for the period.

""The f‚Ä¶","Brussels (Belgium) 13 April 2023 - 07:00 AM (CET) - UCB  a global biopharmaceutical company  today announced that The Lancet Neurology has published data from the Phase 3 MycarinG study evaluating the efficacy and safety of rozanolixizumab in adult patients with acetylcholine receptor autoantibody-positive (AChR-Ab+) or muscle-specific tyrosine kinase autoantibody-positive (MuSK-Ab+) generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) and the Phase 3 RAISE study evaluating the efficacy and safety of zilucoplan in adult patients with mild to severe AChR-Ab+ gMG.1 2UCB is investigating both therapies as part of a broad offering to treat adult patients living with gMG throughout their treatment journey; each has an individual mechanism of action targeting the underlying disease pathology that causes gMG.The safety and efficacy of rozanolixizumab and zilucoplan have not been established and neither treatment is approved for use in any indication by any regulatory authority worldwide.""There is an ongoing need for well-tolerated  targeted treatment options to improve the quality of life of people living with gMG. Many of the current treatment options only offer symptomatic relief which results in a treatment burden in addition to the already substantial disease burden "" said Iris Loew-Friedrich  Executive Vice-President and Chief Medical Officer at UCB. ""These papers published in The Lancet Neurology further reinforce the potential of rozanolixizumab and zilucoplan - with their different MOAs - to provide targeted treatment options to patients to help them manage fluctuating and unpredictable symptoms both at home and in a healthcare setting.""In the MycarinG study1 (n=200) - the largest gMG population Phase 3 study published to date - in adult patients with AChR-Ab+ or MuSK-Ab+ gMG  rozanolixizumab demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in MG-specific outcomes in patients with MuSK-Ab+ or AChR-Ab+ gMG  that were consistent with prior published results. Reductions in MG-ADL score from baseline to day 43 were greater in the rozanolixizumab 7 mg/kg group (least-squares mean change -3¬∑37 [SE 0¬∑49]) and in the rozanolixizumab 10 mg/kg group (-3¬∑40 [0¬∑49]) than with placebo (-0¬∑78 [0¬∑49]; for 7 mg/kg  least-squares mean difference ‚àí2¬∑59 [95% CI ‚àí4¬∑09 to ‚àí1¬∑25]  p<0¬∑0001; for 10 mg/kg  ‚àí2¬∑62 [‚àí3¬∑99 to ‚àí1¬∑16]  p<0¬∑0001). In the MuSK-Ab+ specific subgroup  improvement in MG-ADL was -7.28 (7mg/kg; n=5)  -4.16 (10mg/kg; n=8)  and 2.28 (placebo; n=8). In the AChR-Ab+ specific subgroup  improvement in MG-ADL was -3.03 (7mg/kg; n=60)  -3.36  (10mg/kg; n=60)  and -1.10 (placebo; n=59).Both rozanolixizumab doses were generally well tolerated with similar occurrences of TEAEs between both doses. The most frequently reported TEAEs were headache  diarrhea  and pyrexia. A higher incidence of headache was reported in the rozanolixizumab groups versus placebo  with most cases mild to moderate and severe cases generally managed with non-opioid analgesics. Treatment discontinuation rates due to TEAEs were low.Importantly  the MycarinG study included Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs) measures as secondary endpoints. The novel Myasthenia Gravis Symptoms PRO (MGS-PRO) - a measure used to assess symptom severity and impact of MG on patient lives  including physical fatigue which is not covered in other MG clinical outcome assessments - demonstrated statistically significant results vs placebo.""The findings from the MycarinG study support the mechanism of action of neonatal Fc receptor inhibition and the potential for rozanolixizumab in adult patients with acetylcholine receptor autoantibody positive (AChR-Ab+) or muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK-Ab+) autoantibody positive generalized myasthenia gravis "" explained Professor Vera Bril  Professor of Medicine (Neurology)  University of Toronto  Director of the Neuromuscular Section  Division of Neurology  University of Toronto and University Health Network  Toronto  and lead investigator of the MycarinG study. ""Rozanolixizumab showed clinically meaningful improvements in patient-reported and investigator-assessed outcomes for both 7 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg doses. Both doses were generally well tolerated. If approved in the future  rozanolixizumab represents a potential additional treatment option for adult patients with generalized myasthenia gravis.""In the RAISE study2 (n=174)  in adult patients with mild to severe AChR-Ab+ gMG  zilucoplan demonstrated rapid efficacy  with consistent  sustained  clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvements versus placebo from baseline to week 12 in both patient and clinician-reported endpoints  including MG-ADL  which was the primary efficacy endpoint  and QMG  MGC and MGQoL15  which were secondary efficacy endpoints (the threshold for clinically meaningful MG-QoL15r has not yet been established).2 At Week 12  more patients receiving zilucoplan  achieved a ‚â•3-point reduction in MG-ADL score without rescue therapy  compared with those receiving placebo (73% and 46%  respectively; odds ratio [95% CI] = 3¬∑18 [1¬∑66  6¬∑10]; p=0¬∑0005;). Additionally  more patients receiving zilucoplan  compared with those receiving placebo  (58% and 33%  respectively) achieved a ‚â•5-point reduction in QMG score without rescue therapy at Week 12 (odds ratio [95% CI] = 2¬∑87 [1¬∑52  5¬∑40]; p=0¬∑0012;).Zilucoplan was generally well tolerated with a favorable safety profile. The most frequently reported TEAEs in the zilucoplan group were injection site bruising  headache  diarrhea  and (worsening of) MG.2 Incidences of serious TEAEs and serious infections were similar in both groups. All patients who completed the 12-week treatment period (n=166) chose to enroll in RAISE-XT  the ongoing open label extension study.2 If approved  zilucoplan would be the first C5 complement inhibitor in gMG that patients can self-administer at home.""In the RAISE study  zilucoplan showed rapid and clinically meaningful improvements in myasthenia gravis-specific efficacy outcomes  had a favorable safety profile  and was generally well tolerated  with no major safety findings "" said James F. Howard  MD  Distinguished Professor of Neuromuscular Disease  Professor of Neurology  Medicine and Allied Health  The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Medicine and lead investigator in the RAISE trial. ""These results suggest that  if approved in the future  zilucoplan could present a potential new treatment option for a broad population of adult patients with AChR-Ab+ generalized myasthenia gravis.""Earlier this year  the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted UCB's filing to review a Biologic License Application (BLA) for rozanolixizumab for the treatment of gMG in adult patients. The BLA was designated for Priority Review  with a response from the agency anticipated in Q2 2023. This BLA followed the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) validation of the Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for rozanolixizumab  and the FDA's acceptance of a New Drug Application (NDA) and the EMA's validation of the MAA for zilucoplan in the same indication. Regulatory applications for rozanolixizumab and zilucoplan for the treatment of gMG have also been filed in Japan. Responses from regulatory agencies to these submissions are expected in H2 2023.""Our ultimate goal is to provide targeted treatment options that can help reduce the ongoing daily burden of gMG  giving patients additional flexible treatment options that work alongside their daily life "" said Charl van Zyl  Executive Vice President Neurology Solutions & Head of EU/International Markets  UCB. ""With measures such as MGS-PRO in the MycarinG study  we have been able to see the positive impact rozanolixizumab has had on patient experience  while results from the RAISE study demonstrated the potential of zilucoplan as an effective and generally well-tolerated treatment that can be self-administered at home  giving people greater independence. These results bring us one step forward towards offering tailored options to meet individual patient needs.""gMG is a rare  chronic  heterogeneous (phenotypic and pathogenic)  and unpredictable auto-immune disease characterized by dysfunction and damage at the neuromuscular junction.3 Several factors are understood to be drivers of gMG disease pathology  including complement  immune cells and pathogenic IgG autoantibodies.4People living with gMG can experience a variety of symptoms  including drooping eyelids  double vision  and difficulty in swallowing  chewing and talking  as well as severe muscle weakness that can result in life-threatening weakness of the muscles of respiration.5 6 MG is a rare disease with a global prevalence of 100-350 cases per every 1 million people.7For further information  contact UCB:Brand Communications  Rare DiseasesJim BaxterT+32.2.473.78.85.01jim.baxter@ucb.comCorporate Communications  Media RelationsLaurent SchotsT+32.2.559.92.64Laurent.schots@ucb.comInvestor RelationsAntje WitteT +32.2.559.94.14antje.witte@ucb.comAbout the rozanolixizumab MycarinG study8The MycarinG study (NCT03971422) is a multi-center  Phase 3  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled study evaluating the efficacy and safety of rozanolixizumab in adult patients with gMG  with an open-label extension.1 The primary endpoint for the MycarinG study is change from baseline to day 43 in the Myasthenia Gravis-Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) score  an eight-item patient-reported scale developed to assess MG symptoms and their effects on daily activities.1 Additional secondary endpoints include response rates  changes in the Myasthenia Gravis Composite (MGC) score  the Quantitative MG (QMG) score  patient-reported outcomes and treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) from baseline to day 43.1 The majority of patients taking part in the MycarinG study opted to enroll in the open-label extensions to this clinical trial. As a result  UCB is exploring the potential for further extension studies into this treatment.9For more information about the trial  visit https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/showithNCT03971422.About rozanolixizumabRozanolixizumab is a SC administered  humanized monoclonal antibody that specifically binds  with high affinity  to human neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). It has been designed to block the interaction of FcRn and Immunoglobulin G (IgG)  accelerating the catabolism of antibodies and reducing the concentration of pathogenic IgG autoantibodies.10 11Rozanolixizumab is under clinical development with the aim of improving the lives of people with pathogenic IgG-autoantibody-driven autoimmune disease. In 2019  the US FDA granted orphan drug designation to rozanolixizumab for the treatment of myasthenia gravis.12 Orphan designation was granted in 2020 by the European Commission to rozanolixizumab for the treatment of myasthenia gravis.13The safety and efficacy of rozanolixizumab have not been established and it is not approved for use in any indication by any regulatory authority worldwide.About the zilucoplan RAISE study14The RAISE study (NCT04115293) was a multi-center  Phase 3  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled study to confirm the efficacy  safety  and tolerability of zilucoplan in adult patients with AChR-Ab+ gMG. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive daily subcutaneous (SC) doses of 0.3 mg/kg zilucoplan or placebo for 12 weeks.The primary endpoint for the RAISE study was change from baseline to Week 12 in the Myasthenia Gravis-Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) score. Secondary endpoints included change from baseline in the Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) score  the Myasthenia Gravis Composite (MGC) and the Myasthenia Gravis Quality of Life 15 revised (MG-QoL15r)f score from baseline to Week 12  time to first rescue therapy  the proportion of patients with minimal symptom expression (MSE) (defined as MG-ADL of 0 or 1 without rescue therapy)  the proportion with a ‚â•3-point reduction in MG-ADL and the proportion with a ‚â•5-point reduction in QMG  all measured at Week 12. Secondary safety endpoint was incidence of TEAEs. Patients who completed the RAISE trial had the possibility to enter the open-label extension study  RAISE-XT (NCT04225871).2For more information about the trial visit https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/showithNCT04115293About zilucoplanZilucoplan is a once-daily SC  self-administered peptide inhibitor of complement component 5 (C5 inhibitor) under clinical development by UCB in gMG. As a C5 inhibitor  zilucoplan inhibits complement-mediated damage to the neuromuscular junction through its targeted dual mechanism of action.2 In 2019  the US FDA granted orphan drug designation to zilucoplan for the treatment of myasthenia gravis.15 Orphan designation was granted in 2022 by the European Commission to zilucoplan for the treatment of myasthenia gravis.16The safety and efficacy of zilucoplan have not been established and it is not currently approved for use in any indication by any regulatory authority worldwide.About UCBUCB  Brussels  Belgium (www.ucb.com) is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of innovative medicines and solutions to transform the lives of people living with severe diseases of the immune system or the central nervous system.
