These guidelines shall also apply regarding remuneration (for example consultant‚Äôs fee)  if any  for work carried out by a board member  in addition to the board assignment  for the corporate group of NIBE or one of its group companies. Unless otherwise stated below  the guidelines do not apply to the board member remuneration  which are determined by the Annual General Meeting.The guidelines shall promote the business strategy  long-term interests and sustainability of the companyIn short  NIBE‚Äôs business strategy is to provide world-class sustainable energy solutions. For more information regarding the company‚Äôs business strategy  visit www.nibe.com. A successful implementation of the company‚Äôs business strategy and the procurement of NIBE‚Äôs long-term interests  including its sustainability  rely on NIBE‚Äôs ability to attract and retain a management that is highly qualified and with the capacity to reach stated goals. Thus  it is a prerequisite that the company can offer remuneration terms that are competitive. These guidelines enable NIBE to offer remuneration to senior executives on market terms and to be competitive in order to attract and retain personnel.Types of remunerationRemuneration may be paid as fixed salary  variable salary  pension and other benefits such as car benefit.Board fees shall not be paid to senior executives  who are employed in the group.All senior executives  who have not reached the age of 65  shall have retirement benefits corresponding to the defined benefit ITP-plan (supplementary pensions for ¬≠salaried employees) (SW: ITP-planen)  section 2  for salary parts up to 30 income base amounts (SW: inkomstbasbelopp). For salary parts exceeding 30 income base amounts  a premium with a fixed percentage of 30% shall be paid  in accordance with the same principles as in the ITP-plan with fixed premium  section 1. The retirement premiums may  in total  amount to a maximum of 35% of the total remuneration. Senior executives  who have reached the age of 65  are not entitled to retirement benefits.Other benefits  i.a. medical insurance  life insurance and car benefit  may  in total  amount to a maximum of 5% of the total remuneration.Criteria for payment of variable remunerationSenior executives shall as incentive be able to obtain a variable salary part  which is paid if the goals that have been set are met. These goals are set by the board of directors and shall be measurable and predetermined  e.g. percentage growth  operating margin and working capital reduction. The goals are set for one financial year at a time. By rewarding clear and measurable performance linked to the company‚Äôs financial and operational development  the goals set shall promote to motivate the senior executives to achieve the company‚Äôs goals regarding business strategies  long-term interests and sustainability.The variable salary part shall be limited to four monthly salaries. In addition thereto  an extra monthly salary may be paid as remuneration  provided that the senior executive uses this extra remuneration and an additional monthly salary of his/her variable remuneration for acquisition of NIBE-shares. A condition for the extra remuneration is that the senior executive keeps the annually acquired NIBE-shares for at least three years. If the condition is not met  the company is entitled to recover this part of the remuneration. The purpose of the extra remuneration for acquisition of NIBE-shares is to increase the senior executives‚Äô longterm interests in the company and hence promote the company‚Äôs business strategy  long-term interests and sustainability. Normally  the senior executives‚Äô acquisition of NIBE-shares will be made once a year in February/March  with regard to applicable market abuse legislation. The managing director shall not be included in any incentive program.Termination of employmentSenior executives shall be employed for an indefinite or fixed term.Upon termination by the company  the term of notice for the managing director shall be six months.

This has been achieved by obtaining information regarding the employees‚Äô average salary and terms of employment as well as rate of increase of remuneration over time during the employment at NIBE. A very important additional factor has been the group‚Äôs growth  with regard to the turnover as well as the result. Moreover  comparison has been made with other Swedish listed companies of the same size. This information has been part of the board of directors‚Äô decisionmaking ¬≠documentation in order to evaluate the reasonableness of the guidelines.Fees for consultancy services performed by board membersThe company‚Äôs board members elected by the Annual General Meeting may in special cases be remunerated for consultancy services within their respective fields of competence  which do not constitute the board assignment  for a limited time. For these services  remuneration shall be offered on market terms.How these guidelines have been preparedThese guidelines have been prepared by the board of directors. The managing director and the other senior¬≠executives have not participated in the board of directors‚Äô preparations and decisions regarding these guidelines.The guidelines are subject to annual review through personal contact by the chairman of the board with the major shareholders.Deviation from these guidelinesThe board of directors may deviate from the guidelines as regards pension  bonus and other benefits if there are particular grounds for a deviation in a special case and if it is necessary in order to meet the company‚Äôs long-term interests and sustainability or to ensure the company‚Äôs financial viability.The presence of significant changesThe proposal for guidelines is in line with the guidelines approved at the Annual General Meeting in 2022.

Resolutions by support of the authorization may include provisions on non-cash  set-off or cash payment.The purpose of the authorization and the reasons for any deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights is that issues should be able to take place in order to increase the Company's financial flexibility and the Board of Director's room for maneuver.

Unless there are specific reasons otherwise  the already established composition of the Nomination Committee shall  however  remain unchanged in case such change in the ownership is only marginal or occurs during the three-month period prior to the Annual General Meeting. Should a member resign from the Nomination Committee before his or her work is completed  the shareholder who has appointed such member shall appoint a new member  unless that shareholder is no longer one of the three largest shareholders  in which case the largest shareholder in turn shall appoint the substitute member.

The term of the office for the Nomination Committee ends when the next Nomination Committee has been appointed. The Nomination Committee shall carry out its duties as set out in the Swedish Code of Corporate Governance.Item 18 - Resolution on adoption of a warrant-based incentive program for a maximum of two new key personsThe Board of Directors proposes that the general meeting resolves to adopt a warrant-based incentive program for a maximum of two new key persons in the company through (A) resolution on issue of warrants of series 2023/2026 to the company  and (B) resolution on approval of transfer of warrants of series 2023/2026 from the company to a maximum of two new key persons in the company  in accordance with below.Background and objectiveThe Board of Directors considers it important that new key persons are given an opportunity to receive remuneration that is related to and dependent on the value growth they contribute to creating  similar to LTIP 2021/2024 and LTIP 2022/2025 that the company¬¥s other key persons are subject to. Furthermore  the Board of Directors believes that it is beneficial for the company and the shareholders that key persons are given a personal and long-term ownership commitment. Such ownership commitment is expected to stimulate increased interest in the company's business and earnings development as a whole  as well as to achieve increased community of interest between the participants and the company's shareholders.In light of the terms  the size of the allotment and other circumstances  the Board of Directors considers that the proposed warrant program as follows below is reasonable and beneficial for the company and its shareholders.A. Issue of warrantsThe Board of Directors proposes that the general meeting resolves on a directed issue of no more than 40 000 warrants of series 2023/2026  meaning the share capital upon full exercise may increase by no more than SEK 1 020.90. The following conditions shall otherwise apply to the resolution.The right to subscribe warrants is  with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  given to Re:NewCell AB with the right and obligation to transfer the warrants to a maximum of two new key persons within the company in accordance with the proposal under item B below. The company shall have no right to dispose of the warrants in any other way than as follows from the proposal under item B below. Over-subscription is not allowed. The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights is that the warrants shall be used within the framework of the warrant program. The warrants shall be issued free of charge to the company. Subscription of the warrants shall take place within six months from the day of the resolution on the issue. The Board of Directors has the right to prolong the subscription period. Each (1) warrant entitles to subscription of one (1) share in the company. Subscription of new shares by support of the warrants may take place during the period commencing on 1 December 2026 (however not earlier than the day after the publication of the company's interim report for the period Q3 2026) up to and including the date that falls 30 calendar days thereafter. Under the terms and conditions of the warrants  the period during which the warrants may be exercised may be extended if participants are prevented from exercising their subscription rights due to applicable laws on insider trading or any equivalents. The subscription price for each new share subscribed by support of the warrants shall be determined to an amount equivalent to 160 percent of the volume-weighted average price of the company's share on Nasdaq First North Premier Growth Market during the period of ten trading days immediately preceding the offer to subscribe for warrants  rounded to the nearest full ten cents (Sw. √∂re) whereby five cents shall be rounded up. However  the subscription price shall not be less than the share's quota value. In connection with subscription of shares exercised through warrants  the part of the subscription price that exceeds the quotient value shall be added to the non-restricted share premium reserve. The newly issued shares following exercise of the warrants shall carry rights to dividends for the first time on the first record date for dividend that takes place after the shares have been registered and recorded in the share register kept by Euroclear Sweden AB. Warrants held by the company and which have not been transferred in accordance with item B below or which have been repurchased from the participants may be canceled by the company following a resolution by the Board of Directors. Cancellation must be reported to the Swedish Companies Registration Office for registration. The complete terms and conditions for the warrants are available on the company's website  renewcell.com. As set forth in the terms and conditions for the warrants  the subscription price and the number of shares that each warrant entitle to subscription of may be recalculated in certain cases.B. Approval of transfer of warrantsThe Board of Directors proposes that the general meeting resolves to approve that the company  within the framework of the warrant program  transfers no more than 40 000 warrants of series 2023/2026 to a maximum of two new key persons in the company on the following terms:The warrant program will include a maximum of two new key persons (the ""participants"") with a total allocation of a maximum of 40 000 warrants of series 2023/2026 and with an allocation of a maximum of 40 000 warrants to one participant. Over-allotment is not allowed.Right to acquire warrants from the company presupposes that the participants by the end of the subscription period have not resigned or been dismissed. Warrants that are not acquired as above or that are repurchased from participants may be offered future new key persons. For such acquisitions  the conditions shall be the same or equivalent to what is stated in this resolution.Transfers to the participants presupposes that the warrants can be acquired legally and that the Board of Directors assesses that it can be made against reasonable administrative and financial efforts.Transfer to the participants may not take place after the 2024 Annual General Meeting. The company's Board of Directors resolves on the final allotment  in accordance with the principles established by the general meeting.The reason why persons may be granted warrants at such a time that the time between the allotment and the beginning of the period for subscription of new shares by support of the warrants may be less than three years is that the Board of Directors deems it important that such new employees  for the reasons that apply to the program as a whole  are given an opportunity to take part in the value growth of Re:NewCell's share already at the beginning of the employment.The warrants shall be transferred on market terms at a price established in accordance with a calculated market value for the warrants by application of Black & Scholes valuation model.Payment for allotted warrants shall be made in cash no later than ten days after the notice of acquisition. The warrants shall otherwise be subject to market terms.A prerequisite for being allotted warrants is that the participants have signed a special post-transfer purchase rights agreement on customary terms and conditions set by the Board of Directors. Under the terms of the repurchase agreement  the company  or its designee  has the right to repurchase warrants from the participants under certain conditions  subject to such limitations as may be imposed by law.DilutionAs of the day of the proposal there are 37 358 416 shares in the company. If all warrants that may be issued and transferred are exercised for subscription of shares  the number of shares and votes in the company will increase by no more than 40 000 (subject to possible recalculation of the number of shares according to the terms and conditions of the warrants)  corresponding to a dilution of the share capital and votes in the company of approximately 0.11 percent.Preliminary valuation  costs for the company and effect on key ratiosThe market value of a warrant of series 2023/2026 is  pursuant to preliminary valuation in accordance with Black & Scholes valuation model  SEK 10.02. The preliminary valuation is based on the assumption that the volume-weighted average price of the company's share on Nasdaq First North Premier Growth Market during the period of ten trading days immediately preceding the offer to subscribe for the warrants  will amount to SEK 77.30  resulting in a subscription price of SEK 123.70 per share upon exercise of the warrants  and the assumption of a volatility of 37.5 percent  a risk-free interest rate of 2.7 percent  a dividend yield of 0 percent and a term of three years.

These guidelines shall also apply regarding remuneration (for example consultant‚Äôs fee)  if any  for work carried out by a board member  in addition to the board assignment  for the corporate group of NIBE or one of its group companies.

A successful implementation of the company‚Äôs business strategy and the procurement of NIBE‚Äôs long-term interests  including its sustainability  rely on NIBE‚Äôs ability to attract and retain a management that is highly qualified and with the capacity to reach stated goals.

The general meeting assigns the chairman of the board of directors to contact the four largest shareholders or owner groups in terms of votes (including both directly registered shareholders and custodian registered shareholders)  based on Euroclear Sweden AB‚Äôs extract of the share register as of 30 September each year  of which each will appoint one representative to  in addition to the chairman of the board of directors  constitute the nomination committee until a new nomination committee is appointed in accordance with these instructions. If any of the four largest shareholders or owner groups decline to exercise the right to appoint a representative  the fifth largest shareholder or owner group shall be given the opportunity to exercise such right  and so on until the nomination committee consists of five members. The majority of the members of the nomination committee shall be independent in relation to the Company and the Company‚Äôs management. At least one of the members of the nomination committee shall be independent in relation to the Company‚Äôs largest shareholder or group of shareholders  in terms of votes  working together with the administration of the Company. The CEO or any another member of the Company‚Äôs management must not be a member of the nomination committee. Members of the board of directors may be appointed to the nomination committee but are not to constitute a majority of its members. If more than one member of the board of directors is appointed to the nomination committee  no more than one member may be dependent in relation to the Company‚Äôs larger shareholders. The nomination committee appoints the chairman of the committee among themselves. The chairman of the board of directors or any other member of the board of directors may not be the chairman of the nomination committee. The composition of the nomination committee must be announced no later than six months prior to the annual general meeting. If earlier than two months prior to the annual general meeting  one or more of the shareholders having appointed representatives to the nomination committee is/are no longer among the four largest shareholders  representatives appointed by these shareholders shall resign and the shareholders who then are among the four largest shareholders may appoint their representatives. Should a member resign from the nomination committee before its work is completed and the nomination committee considers it necessary to replace him or her  such substitute member is to represent the same shareholder or  if the shareholder is no longer one of the four largest shareholders  the next largest shareholder in turn  in accordance with the principles above  but based on Euroclear Sweden AB‚Äôs transcription of the share register as soon as possible after the date the representative left the committee. Changes to the composition of the nomination committee must be announced immediately. Remuneration shall not be paid to the members of the nomination committee. The Company shall  however  pay any necessary expenses that the nomination committee may incur in its work. The term of office for the nomination committee ends when the composition of the following nomination committee has been announced. The nomination committee shall fulfil the tasks set out in the Swedish Corporate Governance Code and shall present proposals for the following resolutions at the annual general meeting: proposal for chairman of the meeting; proposal for the board of directors; proposal for chairman of the board of directors; proposal for auditors; proposal for remuneration for the board of directors  divided between the chairman and the other members of the board of directors and any remuneration for work in the committees; proposal for remuneration for the Company‚Äôs auditors; proposal for principles for appointing a nomination committee for the annual general meeting; and proposal for amendments of the instructions for the nomination committee. The nomination committee has the right  at Sinch's expense  to engage external consultants whom the nomination committee considers necessary to fulfil its task. Resolution on guidelines for compensation to senior executives (item 13) The board of directors proposes the following guidelines for compensation to senior executives. These guidelines do not apply to any remuneration resolved on or approved by a general meeting and constitute a framework under which remuneration to senior executives may be decided by the board of directors. The previous guidelines were approved by the annual general meeting in 2022. The reasons for the proposed changes are harmonization due to previous acquisitions and market conditions in various geographies in which the Company has significant operations  including the recent recruitment of a new CEO based in the United States. In summary  the proposed changes are: To adjust the short-term variable pay to not exceed 50 per cent of the fixed base pay (30 per cent in 2022).To introduce a special compensation to allow extraordinary incentives when hiring new and retaining existing members of the senior executives‚Äô team (see definition below).To adjust other benefits to not exceed 10 per cent of the fixed base pay (6 per cent in 2022).To adjust notice period and severance pay period for the CEO to not exceed 6 months‚Äô notice and 12 months‚Äô severance. The Company has not received any comments on the guidelines from any shareholders. For the purposes of these guidelines  the members of the senior executives‚Äô team consists of board members of the Company who are employed by group  the CEO  the deputy CEO (if applicable) and other members of the senior executives‚Äô team who report to the CEO. The senior executives‚Äô team currently comprises 12 senior executives  including the CEO. A prerequisite for the successful implementation of the Company‚Äôs business strategy and safeguarding of its long-term interests  including its sustainability  is that the Company is able to recruit and retain qualified personnel. Compensation to the CEO and other senior executives must therefore reflect Sinch‚Äôs need to recruit and motivate qualified employees by means of compensation packages perceived as fair and competitive. The board of directors is empowered to depart from the below guidelines if in a specific case there is a special cause for the deviation and a deviation is necessary to serve the Company‚Äôs long-term interests  including sustainability  or to ensure the Company‚Äôs financial viability. In the preparation of the board of directors‚Äô proposal for these guidelines for compensation to the CEO and other senior executives  salary and employment conditions for employees of the Company have been taken into account by including information on the employees‚Äô total remuneration  the components of the remuneration and increase and growth rate over time  in the board of directors‚Äô basis for its decision. Compensation consists of the following components: Fixed base payShort- and long-term variable paySpecial compensationPension benefitsOther benefitsPay during period of notice of termination or resignation Market based compensation The Company has acquired high quality benchmark data from third party sources to secure that compensation to the CEO and other senior executives reflects what is offered to executives in comparable positions in other companies. Market rate is also secured through recruitment processes  in the cases where executives are recruited externally. Fixed base pay The fixed base pay must be market based and reflect the employee‚Äôs position  qualifications  experience and individual performance. Short-term variable pay Short-term variable pay shall be measured against predefined financial performance targets. Non-financial objectives may also be used to sharpen focus on achieving the Company‚Äôs strategic plans. Objectives shall be specific  clear  measurable  subject to deadlines and adopted by the board of directors. They shall further be designed to contribute to the Company‚Äôs business strategy  long-term interests and sustainability. To which extent the criteria for awarding variable remuneration has been satisfied shall be evaluated/determined when the relevant measurement period has ended. The board of directors has delegated the responsibility for the evaluation so far as it concerns variable remuneration to the CEO and other senior executives to the remuneration committee. Levels and targets for variable pay are suggested annually by the CEO for other senior executives and approved by the board of directors. Levels and targets for the CEO are defined by the board of directors. Short-term variable pay may not exceed 50 per cent of the fixed base pay  as management compensation should be focused on long term incentives. Long-term variable pay Long-term variable pay may encompass share-related incentive programs. These guidelines do not apply to remuneration resolved on or approved by a general meeting. Accordingly  these guidelines do not apply to the Company‚Äôs share- related incentive programs LTI 2018  LTI 2019  LTI 2020  LTI II 2020  LTI 2021  LTI II 2021  LTI 2022 and the proposed LTI 2023. Each year  the board of directors evaluates whether a long-term share-related incentive program should be proposed to the annual general meeting. The purpose of offering a share-related incentive program is to ensure that the interests of senior executives coincide with those of the Company‚Äôs shareholders. Individual  long-term ownership among key individuals can be expected to stimulate keener interest in the business and its profitability  increase motivation  and enhance the sense of belonging with the Company and thereby contribute to the Company‚Äôs business strategy  long-term interests and sustainability. Long-term share-related incentives also helps to retain current executives and attract new executives when recruiting. Special compensation Additional variable cash compensation may be offered to key employees who remain employed in connection with acquisitions of new companies  divestments of businesses  other transitional activity or who perform other extraordinary work endeavours. Such special compensation may not exceed 50 per cent of the contracted annual fixed base salary. Special compensation may only be awarded in special cases and shall not be included in any ordinary compensation system. Decisions regarding special compensation shall always be made by the board of directors. Pensions Pension benefits for the CEO and other senior executives must reflect customary market terms  compared with what generally applies to executives in comparable positions in other companies  and should normally be based upon defined contribution pension plans. Retirement occurs at the relevant/applicable retirement age. Pension benefits may not exceed 35 per cent of the fixed base pay unless higher contributions follow from a pension plan pursuant to an applicable collective bargaining agreement. Other benefits Other continuous employee benefits may  among other things  consist of health insurance and fitness/wellness programs. The costs for such benefits may not exceed 10 per cent of the fixed base pay. Notice periods and severance pay As a general rule  employment agreements entered into between the Company and senior executives shall be on an indefinite basis. If the Company terminates the CEO‚Äôs employment  the period of notice shall be a maximum of six months. If the CEO resigns  the period of notice shall be six months. A period of notice applies between the Company and other senior executives of up to six months  whether the employee resigns or is terminated. In addition to compensation paid during the applicable period of notice  any severance pay after the applicable notice period shall not exceed an amount equivalent to the fixed base pay for 12 months for the CEO and 6 months for other senior executives. What is stated above constitutes a framework under which individual terms are to be resolved on by the board of directors. Compensation to founders of the Company Compensation to founders of the Company is subject to approval by the board of directors. Founders are excluded from the requirement of market-based pay  i.e. their compensation and benefits may be below market  as they are compensated through their ownership in the Company. Compensation to founders of the Company consists of the following components: Fixed base payPension benefitsAdditional vacation entitlementPay during period of notice of termination or resignation If a founder is temporarily covering another management position  the founder will be compensated during this period with a base pay equal to the person in the management team with the lowest salary at the time  excluding other founders. Approval Changes in terms  conditions and compensation to the CEO is subject to approval from the chairman of the board of directors. Day to day costs such as travel expenses for the CEO are approved by the CFO  and quarterly summaries are sent to the chairman of the board of directors. New recruitments  salary changes and other significant changes for other senior executives than the CEO are subject to approval from the chairman of the board of directors  whereas minor adjustments  and day to day costs are approved by the CEO. Payout of fixed base pay is prepared by local payroll departments and are approved before payout by the local HR representative. Payout of short-term variable pay is subject to approval from the CEO as regards other senior executives and from the chairman of the board of directors as regards the CEO. Eligibility for share-related incentive program must be approved by the board of directors based on the proposal approved at a general meeting. Controls and decision-making process The Company has a remuneration committee which consists of two members of the board of directors. The chairman of the board of directors is also chairman of the remuneration committee. The remuneration committee shall  in relation to the board of directors  have a preparatory function in respect of principles for remuneration  remuneration and other terms of employment regarding the senior executives. Consequently  the remuneration committee shall prepare a proposal in respect of guidelines for compensation to senior executives  which it shall present to the board of directors. The proposal shall then be presented to and resolved upon by the annual general meeting. The remuneration committee shall also evaluate the application of the guidelines resolved upon by the annual general meeting. The board of directors shall at least every fourth year or upon material changes to the guidelines make a proposal on guidelines to be resolved by the annual general meeting. The guidelines shall be applied in relation to every commitment on compensation to senior executives and every change in such commitment  which is resolved after the annual general meeting at which the guidelines were adopted. Thus  the guidelines have no impact on pre-existing contractually binding commitments. Guidelines resolved upon may also be amended by way of a resolution by any other general meeting. Further  the remuneration committee shall  within the scope of the guidelines resolved upon by the annual general meeting  prepare proposals regarding remuneration to the CEO and other senior executives. The board of directors shall annually evaluate the CEO‚Äôs performance. Further  the remuneration committee shall observe and evaluate programs for variable compensation to the senior executives which are ongoing or finished during the year as well as the Company‚Äôs current remuneration structure and remuneration levels. Furthermore  the remuneration committee shall annually prepare a remuneration report regarding the compensation to the senior executives. The remuneration report shall be made available to the shareholders on the Company‚Äôs website by the remuneration committee not later than three weeks prior to the annual general meeting. Within the scope and on the basis of the guidelines  the board of directors shall annually decide on the specific revised remuneration terms for each senior executive and make such other decisions on compensation to senior executives that may be required. The CEO or other senior executives shall not participate in the remuneration committee‚Äôs and the board of directors‚Äô processing of and resolutions regarding remuneration-related matters in so far as they are affected by such matters. Compliance with guidelines is controlled annually through the following activities: Collection of documented annual targets for short-term variable payRandom samples of salary payout approvalsSample reports from payroll systems to identify any out of the ordinary payouts The results of the controls are summarized and reported to the remuneration committee. Resolution on approval of the remuneration report (item 14) The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to approve the remuneration report pursuant to Chapter 8  Section 53 a of the Swedish Companies Act. Resolution on authorization for the board of directors to resolve on new issues of shares (item 15) The board of directors proposes that the meeting authorizes the board of directors to  on one or several occasions  until the next annual general meeting  resolve on new issues of shares to be paid in cash  in kind or by way of set-off or otherwise on terms and conditions and that such new issue can be performed with deviation from the shareholders‚Äô preferential rights. The issues are to be performed on market terms  taking into account any discount on market terms. The reason for the authorization and the reason for the possible deviation from the shareholders‚Äô preferential rights is to enable capital raisings for the acquisition of companies  or parts of companies  and for the operations of the Company. The board of directors is entitled to resolve on share issues causing an increase of the Company‚Äôs share capital of at most 10 per cent of the Company‚Äôs registered share capital at the time the board of directors first utilizes the authorization. Resolution on implementation of long-term incentive program 2023 (LTI 2023)  issue and transfer of warrants to participants in LTI 2023 and issue of warrants to secure delivery of shares upon exercise of employee stock options granted under LTI 2023 (item 16) Background and reasons Since the Company‚Äôs IPO in 2015  the Company has implemented several share-related incentive programs  of which one program  LTI 2016  has reached full maturity with no more outstanding warrants or employee stock options. In addition  the incentive program LTI 2018 will expire by the end of the second quarter of 2023. The board of directors considers it to be in the best interest of Sinch and its shareholders to implement an additional long-term incentive program (‚ÄúLTI 2023‚Äù) for senior executives  key personnel and other employees in the group  in accordance with this proposal. LTI 2023 is proposed to include up to approximately 925 current and future senior executives  key personnel and other employees within the Sinch group. The proposal has been based on the assessment of the board of directors that it is important  and in the interest of all shareholders  to create even greater participation in the group‚Äôs development for current and future senior executives  key personnel and employees of the group. The board of directors also considers it important to be able to attract talent over time  to encourage continued employment and to maintain a satisfactory employee retention level. In view of the above  the board of directors proposes that the general meeting resolves to implement the LTI 2023 in accordance with items (a)‚Äì(d) below. The resolutions under items (a)‚Äì(d) are proposed to be conditional upon each other and for that reason it is proposed that all resolutions are to be passed as one resolution. Item (a) ‚Äì Proposal on implementation of LTI 2023 LTI 2023 comprises five (5) Series.

Warrants shall also be available to future new employees. For acquisitions made by future new employees  the terms shall be the same or equal to the terms that are set out in this resolution. This means  inter alia  that such acquisitions shall take place based on the market value of the warrants at such point in time  and that the board of directors shall set forth an equivalent notification period for new employees whose acquisitions take place after the initial notification period. The valuation of the warrants shall be made by an independent appraiser or audit firm. Since the warrants are acquired by the participants at market value  there are no performance conditions that need to be fulfilled in order to be offered to acquire warrants or in order to exercise warrants for subscription of shares. However  the Company will  in connection with the transfer of the warrants to the participants  reserve a pre-emption right regarding the warrants if the participant‚Äôs employment or assignment within the group is terminated or if the participant wishes to transfer its warrants.

In the event the participant is prevented from exercising employee stock options due to the EU Market Abuse Regulation or other applicable laws or internal policies  Sinch‚Äôs board of directors may prolong the exercise period for such participants with a corresponding period  however not longer than eight (8) months. Preparation and administration The board of directors shall be responsible for the design  interpretation and management of stock options granted under LTI 2023 within the framework of the above-mentioned principal terms and conditions. The board of directors has the right to make reasonable changes and adjustments in detailed terms and conditions of the framework for stock options under LTI 2023 as deemed necessary or appropriate due to differences in local legislation or practices or for administrative purposes. For holders of stock options who are members of the group management  the board of directors is entitled to (i) accelerate vesting of stock options in the event of a change of control situation where the holder is dismissed from his or her employment in connection therewith and (ii) permit extended vesting and exercisability during the severance period  e.g. in good leaver situations. The board of directors also has the right to adjust detailed terms and conditions of stock options in the event of significant changes within the group or its operational environment that entail that the framework established for stock options under LTI 2023 is no longer reasonable or appropriate  provided that such changes are not more favorable to the participant than the terms and conditions set forth in this resolution proposal. Recalculation due to split  consolidation  new share issue etc. The exercise price and the number of shares that each warrant or stock option entitles to subscription of shall be recalculated in the event of a split  consolidation  new share issue etc. in accordance with customary re-calculation terms or as set out in the detailed terms and conditions of warrants. Allocation principles  etc. The participants‚Äô right to acquire warrants or to be granted employee stock options is differentiated between employees with reference to inter alia position  responsibility and working performance in the group. The participants have for this reason been divided into three (3) different categories: Category A (not more than 25 persons): Members of the group management and selected key personnel Category B (not more than 50 persons): Business unit management and key personnel Category C (not more than 850 persons): Other personnel Warrants may be transferred to members of the group management and selected key personnel  business unit management and key personnel and other personnel in Sweden.

Pre-emption shall be made at market value. The warrants are otherwise freely transferable. The right to receive employee stock options of Series 4 shall be reserved for current and future employees of the Sinch group who work outside of Sweden  and employee stock options of Series 5 shall be reserved for current and future employees who work in Sweden. The below allocation principles apply to the grant of warrants/stock options within each of the categories set out above.

The maximum number of warrants and/or stock options per person within each category as set out above may however not be exceeded for any individual. Warrants may be transferred and stock options may be granted on one or more occasion. Neither the Company‚Äôs board members  nor the founders  shall be eligible to participate in LTI 2023. Item (b) ‚Äì Proposal regarding issue and transfer of warrants of Series 1‚Äì3 to participants in LTI 2023 in Sweden The board of directors proposes that the Company shall issue not more than 1 400 000 warrants for subscription of shares  whereof not more than 466 667 warrants in Series 1  not more than 466 667 warrants in Series 2 and not more than 466 666 warrants in Series 3  whereby the Company‚Äôs share capital may be increased by not more than SEK 14 000 at full exercise of the warrants for subscription of shares  corresponding to approximately 0.17 per cent of the share capital in the Company as of the date of this proposal  being SEK 8 386 022.48. The right to subscribe for the warrants shall  with deviation from the shareholders‚Äô preferential rights  only vest in the Subsidiary  with the right and obligation to dispose of the warrants as set out in item (a) above. Each warrant entitles the holder to subscribe for one (1) share in the Company. The warrants will be issued without consideration to the Subsidiary. In order to fulfil the commitments arising from LTI 2023  the board of directors proposes that the general meeting authorizes that the Subsidiary may transfer warrants to participants  assign warrants to a third party  or in another way dispose over the warrants  in accordance with item (a). Detailed resolution proposals for each of the respective issues of warrants Series 1  2 and 3  including complete terms and conditions for the warrants  are set out in the board of directors' complete proposal (including its appendices). Item (c) ‚Äì Proposal on issue of warrants to secure delivery of shares upon exercise of employee stock options of Series 4 The board of directors proposes that the Company shall issue not more than 5 985 000 warrants in Series 4  whereby the Company‚Äôs share capital may be increased by not more than SEK 59 850 at full exercise of the warrants for subscription of shares  corresponding to approximately 0.71 per cent of the share capital in the Company as of the date of this proposal  being SEK 8 386 022.48. The right to subscribe for the warrants shall  with deviation from the shareholders‚Äô preferential rights  only vest in the Subsidiary  with the right and obligation to dispose of the warrants as further described above. Each warrant entitles the holder to subscribe for one (1) share in the Company during the period from and including the date of registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office (Sw. Bolagsverket) up to and including 31 December 2032  at an exercise price equal to the shares‚Äô quota value (currently SEK 0.01). The warrants shall be issued to the Subsidiary without consideration. In order to fulfil the commitments arising from LTI 2023  the board of directors proposes that the general meeting authorizes that the Subsidiary may transfer warrants to a third party  or otherwise dispose over the warrants  in accordance with item (a). A detailed resolution proposal for the issue of warrants Series 4  including complete terms and conditions for the warrants  is set out in the board of directors' complete proposal (including its appendices). Item (d) ‚Äì Proposal on issue of warrants to secure delivery of shares upon exercise of employee stock options of Series 5 The board of directors proposes that the Company shall issue not more than 1 000 000 warrants in Series 5  whereby the Company‚Äôs share capital may be increased by not more than SEK 10 000 at full exercise of the warrants for subscription of shares  corresponding to approximately 0.12 per cent of the share capital in the Company as of the date of this resolution proposal  being SEK 8 386 022.48. The right to subscribe for the warrants shall  with deviation from the shareholders‚Äô preferential rights  only vest in the Subsidiary  with the right and obligation to dispose of the warrants as further described above. Each warrant entitles the holder to subscribe for one (1) share in the Company during the period from and including the date of registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office (Sw. Bolagsverket) up to and including 31 December 2032  at an exercise price equal to the shares‚Äô quota value (currently SEK 0.01). The warrants shall be issued to the Subsidiary without consideration. In order to fulfil the commitments arising from LTI 2023  the board of directors proposes that the general meeting authorizes that the Subsidiary may transfer warrants to a third party  or otherwise dispose over the warrants  in accordance with item (a). A detailed resolution proposal for the issue of warrants Series 5  including complete terms and conditions for the warrants  is set out in the board of directors' complete proposal (including its appendices). Additional information regarding LTI 2023 Market value of warrants of Series 1‚Äì3 Based on a market value of the underlying share of SEK 28.0  the market value of the warrants of Series 1‚Äì3 is  in accordance with a preliminary valuation made by PwC  respectively  SEK 6.19  SEK 6.54 and SEK 7.15 per warrant of Series 1  2 and 3  assuming an exercise price of  respectively  SEK 36.40  SEK 39.20 and SEK 42.0 per share. The Black & Scholes valuation model has been used for the preliminary valuation of the warrants  assuming a risk-free interest of  respectively  2.68  2.56 and 2.40 per cent for warrants of Series 1  2 and 3  and an estimated volatility during the term of the warrants of approximately 40.0 per cent. Costs Given that the warrants of Series 1‚Äì3 shall be transferred at a price corresponding to the market value of the warrants  the Company estimates that no social security costs will arise for the Company in connection with the transfer of warrants to the participants. Neither should any social security costs arise in connection to the exercise of the warrants. The employee stock options Series 4 and 5 are expected to incur accounting costs (accounted for in accordance with the accounting standard IFRS 2) as well as social security costs during the term of the stock options. According to IFRS 2  the employee stock option costs shall be recorded as a personnel expense in the income statement during the vesting period. The total costs for employee stock options Series 4 and 5  calculated in accordance with IFRS 2  are estimated to amount to approximately SEK 53.0 million during the term of the program (excluding social security costs). The estimated costs have been calculated based on  inter alia  the following assumptions: (i) a market price of the Company‚Äôs share of SEK 28.0 at the time of grant  (ii) an estimated future volatility in respect of the Company‚Äôs share during the term of the stock options of 40.0 per cent  (iii) that the maximum number of stock options encompassed by this resolution proposal are granted to participants  (iv) expected time to exercise in accordance with IFRS 2  (v) an annual turnover of personnel of approximately 9.0 per cent based on historical data  and (vi) that all vested stock options are exercised. Social security costs  which are expected to arise primarily in connection to the exercise of stock options  are estimated to amount to approximately SEK 8.4 million during the term of the program  based on inter alia the assumptions set out under items (i)‚Äì(vi) above as well as an average social security rate of 7.1 per cent and an annual increase in the market price of the Company‚Äôs share of 15 per cent during the vesting period. Other costs related to the LTI 2023  including inter alia expenses related to fees to external advisors  external appraiser and administration of the incentive program  are estimated to amount to approximately SEK 2 million during the term of the program. Based on the assumptions set out above  the total costs of the LTI 2023 are estimated to approximately SEK 63.4 million in total during the term of the program. These costs shall be seen in relation to the tot¬≠al employee benefits expenses of the Sinch group  which during the financial year 2022 amounted to SEK 4 203 million. Dilution If all warrants/stock options within the frame of LTI 2023 are transferred or granted to participants and if all warrants/stock options are exercised  up to 8 385 000 shares may be issued  equivalent to a maximum dilution of approximately 0.99 per cent of the shares and votes of the Company. Upon full exercise of the warrants  the Company‚Äôs share capital will increase with SEK 83 850. Together with warrants and stock options which have been transferred or granted to participants in LTI 2018  LTI 2019  LTI 2020  LTI II 2020  LTI 2021  LTI II 2021 and LTI 2022 and which are outstanding as of the date of this resolution proposal  including warrants that have been exercised but where the shares have not yet been registered  the maximum dilution will amount to approximately 4.76 per cent of the shares and votes of the Company. The dilution calculations have been based on the maximum number of shares and votes which may be issued upon exercise of warrants and stock options  divided by the total number of shares and votes in the Company after such issues (based on the number of shares issued in the Company as of the date of this resolution proposal  being 838 602 248 shares). Motivation in respect of Series 4 stock option vesting and exercise conditions According to the Rules on Remuneration laid down by the Stock Market Self-Regulation Committee (Sw. Aktiemarknadens Sj√§lvregleringskommitt√©)  the vesting period  or the period between the date of grant until the date when a warrant or stock option may be exercised shall  as a general rule  not be shorter than three (3) years and any deviations from this general rule shall be justified. As set out further above  vesting of Series 4 employee stock options will start on the first anniversary of the date of grant of the stock options to participants  and on the third anniversary of the date of grant  up to 75 per cent of the employee stock options granted to a participant may have vested (provided that all applicable vesting conditions have then been fulfilled). Further  the vested stock options become exercisable soon after they have vested. The reason for applying such terms  which are not in line with the recommendations of the Stock Market Self-Regulation Committee as set out above  is that the board of directors of the Company consider such terms to be in line with market practice for employee stock option programs in most of the countries where the intended participants in Series 4 of LTI 2023 operate. It is therefore  in the opinion of the board of directors  in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders to apply such terms in order to fulfil the objectives of LTI 2023. Preparation of the proposal This proposal in respect of LTI 2023 has been prepared by the Company‚Äôs remuneration committee and board of directors in consultation with external advisers. The reason for the deviation from the shareholders‚Äô preferential rights The reason for the deviation from the shareholders‚Äô preferential rights is to implement LTI 2023. Majority requirements Since the resolutions under items (a)‚Äì(d) are conditional upon each other and passed as one resolution  a resolution to approve the proposal is valid only when supported by shareholders holding not less than nine-tenths (9/10) of the votes cast as well as the shares represented at the general meeting (as the transfer of warrants to participants under items (b)‚Äì(d) require such majority). Authorization It is proposed that the board of directors  or a person appointed by the board of directors  shall be authorized to make such minor adjustments to this resolution that may be required for the registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office (Sw. Bolagsverket) and Euroclear Sweden AB  and that the board of directors shall have the right to undertake minor adjustments to the incentive program due to applicable foreign rules and laws  applicable laws  regulations or market practice. Overview of outstanding incentive programs Since the Company‚Äôs IPO in 2015  the Company has implemented several share-related incentive programs  of which one program  LTI 2016  has reached full maturity with no more outstanding stock options or warrants. An overview of all outstanding incentive programs is included in the table below.

The CEO or any another member of the Company‚Äôs management must not be a member of the nomination committee.

These guidelines do not apply to any remuneration resolved on or approved by a general meeting and constitute a framework under which remuneration to senior executives may be decided by the board of directors. The previous guidelines were approved by the annual general meeting in 2022.The reasons for the proposed changes are harmonization due to previous acquisitions and market conditions in various geographies in which the Company has significant operations  including the recent recruitment of a new CEO based in the United States. In summary  the proposed changes are:To adjust the short-term variable pay to not exceed 50 per cent of the fixed base pay (30 per cent in 2022).To introduce a special compensation to allow extraordinary incentives when hiring new and retaining existing members of the senior executives‚Äô team (see definition below).To adjust other benefits to not exceed 10 per cent of the fixed base pay (6 per cent in 2022).To adjust notice period and severance pay period for the CEO to not exceed 6 months‚Äô notice and 12 months‚Äô severance.The Company has not received any comments on the guidelines from any shareholders.For the purposes of these guidelines  the members of the senior executives‚Äô team consists of board members of the Company who are employed by group  the CEO  the deputy CEO (if applicable) and other members of the senior executives‚Äô team who report to the CEO. The senior executives‚Äô team currently comprises 12 senior executives  including the CEO.A prerequisite for the successful implementation of the Company‚Äôs business strategy and safeguarding of its long-term interests  including its sustainability  is that the Company is able to recruit and retain qualified personnel. Compensation to the CEO and other senior executives must therefore reflect Sinch‚Äôs need to recruit and motivate qualified employees by means of compensation packages perceived as fair and competitive. The board of directors is empowered to depart from the below guidelines if in a specific case there is a special cause for the deviation and a deviation is necessary to serve the Company‚Äôs long-term interests  including sustainability  or to ensure the Company‚Äôs financial viability.In the preparation of the board of directors‚Äô proposal for these guidelines for compensation to the CEO and other senior executives  salary and employment conditions for employees of the Company have been taken into account by including information on the employees‚Äô total remuneration  the components of the remuneration and increase and growth rate over time  in the board of directors‚Äô basis for its decision.Compensation consists of the following components:Fixed base payShort- and long-term variable paySpecial compensationPension benefitsOther benefitsPay during period of notice of termination or resignationMarket based compensationThe Company has acquired high quality benchmark data from third party sources to secure that compensation to the CEO and other senior executives reflects what is offered to executives in comparable positions in other companies. Market rate is also secured through recruitment processes  in the cases where executives are recruited externally.Fixed base payThe fixed base pay must be market based and reflect the employee‚Äôs position  qualifications  experience and individual performance.Short-term variable payShort-term variable pay shall be measured against predefined financial performance targets. Non-financial objectives may also be used to sharpen focus on achieving the Company‚Äôs strategic plans. Objectives shall be specific  clear  measurable  subject to deadlines and adopted by the board of directors. They shall further be designed to contribute to the Company‚Äôs business strategy  long-term interests and sustainability. To which extent the criteria for awarding variable remuneration has been satisfied shall be evaluated/determined when the relevant measurement period has ended.The board of directors has delegated the responsibility for the evaluation so far as it concerns variable remuneration to the CEO and other senior executives to the remuneration committee.Levels and targets for variable pay are suggested annually by the CEO for other senior executives and approved by the board of directors. Levels and targets for the CEO are defined by the board of directors. Short-term variable pay may not exceed 50 per cent of the fixed base pay  as management compensation should be focused on long term incentives.Long-term variable payLong-term variable pay may encompass share-related incentive programs. These guidelines do not apply to remuneration resolved on or approved by a general meeting. Accordingly  these guidelines do not apply to the Company‚Äôs share- related incentive programs LTI 2018  LTI 2019  LTI 2020  LTI II 2020  LTI 2021  LTI II 2021  LTI 2022 and the proposed LTI 2023. Each year  the board of directors evaluates whether a long-term share-related incentive program should be proposed to the annual general meeting. The purpose of offering a share-related incentive program is to ensure that the interests of senior executives coincide with those of the Company‚Äôs shareholders. Individual  long-term ownership among key individuals can be expected to stimulate keener interest in the business and its profitability  increase motivation  and enhance the sense of belonging with the Company and thereby contribute to the Company‚Äôs business strategy  long-term interests and sustainability. Long-term share-related incentives also helps to retain current executives and attract new executives when recruiting.Special compensationAdditional variable cash compensation may be offered to key employees who remain employed in connection with acquisitions of new companies  divestments of businesses  other transitional activity or who perform other extraordinary work endeavours. Such special compensation may not exceed 50 per cent of the contracted annual fixed base salary. Special compensation may only be awarded in special cases and shall not be included in any ordinary compensation system. Decisions regarding special compensation shall always be made by the board of directors.PensionsPension benefits for the CEO and other senior executives must reflect customary market terms  compared with what generally applies to executives in comparable positions in other companies  and should normally be based upon defined contribution pension plans. Retirement occurs at the relevant/applicable retirement age. Pension benefits may not exceed 35 per cent of the fixed base pay unless higher contributions follow from a pension plan pursuant to an applicable collective bargaining agreement.Other benefitsOther continuous employee benefits may  among other things  consist of health insurance and fitness/wellness programs. The costs for such benefits may not exceed 10 per cent of the fixed base pay.Notice periods and severance payAs a general rule  employment agreements entered into between the Company and senior executives shall be on an indefinite basis.

In addition  the incentive program LTI 2018 will expire by the end of the second quarter of 2023.The board of directors considers it to be in the best interest of Sinch and its shareholders to implement an additional long-term incentive program (‚ÄúLTI 2023‚Äù) for senior executives  key personnel and other employees in the group  in accordance with this proposal. LTI 2023 is proposed to include up to approximately 925 current and future senior executives  key personnel and other employees within the Sinch group.The proposal has been based on the assessment of the board of directors that it is important  and in the interest of all shareholders  to create even greater participation in the group‚Äôs development for current and future senior executives  key personnel and employees of the group. The board of directors also considers it important to be able to attract talent over time  to encourage continued employment and to maintain a satisfactory employee retention level.In view of the above  the board of directors proposes that the general meeting resolves to implement the LTI 2023 in accordance with items (a)‚Äì(d) below.

The Black & Scholes valuation model has been used for the preliminary valuation of the warrants  assuming a risk-free interest of  respectively  2.68  2.56 and 2.40 per cent for warrants of Series 1  2 and 3  and an estimated volatility during the term of the warrants of approximately 40.0 per cent.CostsGiven that the warrants of Series 1‚Äì3 shall be transferred at a price corresponding to the market value of the warrants  the Company estimates that no social security costs will arise for the Company in connection with the transfer of warrants to the participants. Neither should any social security costs arise in connection to the exercise of the warrants.The employee stock options Series 4 and 5 are expected to incur accounting costs (accounted for in accordance with the accounting standard IFRS 2) as well as social security costs during the term of the stock options. According to IFRS 2  the employee stock option costs shall be recorded as a personnel expense in the income statement during the vesting period. The total costs for employee stock options Series 4 and 5  calculated in accordance with IFRS 2  are estimated to amount to approximately SEK 53.0 million during the term of the program (excluding social security costs). The estimated costs have been calculated based on  inter alia  the following assumptions: (i) a market price of the Company‚Äôs share of SEK 28.0 at the time of grant  (ii) an estimated future volatility in respect of the Company‚Äôs share during the term of the stock options of 40.0 per cent  (iii) that the maximum number of stock options encompassed by this resolution proposal are granted to participants  (iv) expected time to exercise in accordance with IFRS 2  (v) an annual turnover of personnel of approximately 9.0 per cent based on historical data  and (vi) that all vested stock options are exercised. Social security costs  which are expected to arise primarily in connection to the exercise of stock options  are estimated to amount to approximately SEK 8.4 million during the term of the program  based on inter alia the assumptions set out under items (i)‚Äì(vi) above as well as an average social security rate of 7.1 per cent and an annual increase in the market price of the Company‚Äôs share of 15 per cent during the vesting period.Other costs related to the LTI 2023  including inter alia expenses related to fees to external advisors  external appraiser and administration of the incentive program  are estimated to amount to approximately SEK 2 million during the term of the program.Based on the assumptions set out above  the total costs of the LTI 2023 are estimated to approximately SEK 63.4 million in total during the term of the program.These costs shall be seen in relation to the tot¬≠al employee benefits expenses of the Sinch group  which during the financial year 2022 amounted to SEK 4 203 million.DilutionIf all warrants/stock options within the frame of LTI 2023 are transferred or granted to participants and if all warrants/stock options are exercised  up to 8 385 000 shares may be issued  equivalent to a maximum dilution of approximately 0.99 per cent of the shares and votes of the Company. Upon full exercise of the warrants  the Company‚Äôs share capital will increase with SEK 83 850. Together with warrants and stock options which have been transferred or granted to participants in LTI 2018  LTI 2019  LTI 2020  LTI II 2020  LTI 2021  LTI II 2021 and LTI 2022 and which are outstanding as of the date of this resolution proposal  including warrants that have been exercised but where the shares have not yet been registered  the maximum dilution will amount to approximately 4.76 per cent of the shares and votes of the Company. The dilution calculations have been based on the maximum number of shares and votes which may be issued upon exercise of warrants and stock options  divided by the total number of shares and votes in the Company after such issues (based on the number of shares issued in the Company as of the date of this resolution proposal  being 838 602 248 shares).Motivation in respect of Series 4 stock option vesting and exercise conditionsAccording to the Rules on Remuneration laid down by the Stock Market Self-Regulation Committee (Sw. Aktiemarknadens Sj√§lvregleringskommitt√©)  the vesting period  or the period between the date of grant until the date when a warrant or stock option may be exercised shall  as a general rule  not be shorter than three (3) years and any deviations from this general rule shall be justified. As set out further above  vesting of Series 4 employee stock options will start on the first anniversary of the date of grant of the stock options to participants  and on the third anniversary of the date of grant  up to 75 per cent of the employee stock options granted to a participant may have vested (provided that all applicable vesting conditions have then been fulfilled). Further  the vested stock options become exercisable soon after they have vested. The reason for applying such terms  which are not in line with the recommendations of the Stock Market Self-Regulation Committee as set out above  is that the board of directors of the Company consider such terms to be in line with market practice for employee stock option programs in most of the countries where the intended participants in Series 4 of LTI 2023 operate. It is therefore  in the opinion of the board of directors  in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders to apply such terms in order to fulfil the objectives of LTI 2023.Preparation of the proposalThis proposal in respect of LTI 2023 has been prepared by the Company‚Äôs remuneration committee and board of directors in consultation with external advisers.The reason for the deviation from the shareholders‚Äô preferential rightsThe reason for the deviation from the shareholders‚Äô preferential rights is to implement LTI 2023.Majority requirementsSince the resolutions under items (a)‚Äì(d) are conditional upon each other and passed as one resolution  a resolution to approve the proposal is valid only when supported by shareholders holding not less than nine-tenths (9/10) of the votes cast as well as the shares represented at the general meeting (as the transfer of warrants to participants under items (b)‚Äì(d) require such majority).AuthorizationIt is proposed that the board of directors  or a person appointed by the board of directors  shall be authorized to make such minor adjustments to this resolution that may be required for the registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office (Sw. Bolagsverket) and Euroclear Sweden AB  and that the board of directors shall have the right to undertake minor adjustments to the incentive program due to applicable foreign rules and laws  applicable laws  regulations or market practice.Overview of outstanding incentive programsSince the Company‚Äôs IPO in 2015  the Company has implemented several share-related incentive programs  of which one program  LTI 2016  has reached full maturity with no more outstanding stock options or warrants.

Resolution on the principles for the work of the nomination committee and instructions for the nomination committee (item 12) The nomination committee proposes that the following principles for the work of the nomination committee and instructions for the nomination committee  which  save for limited wording changes  are the same principles which were adopted at the annual general meeting 2022  shall apply until further notice. The general meeting assigns the chairman of the board of directors to contact the four largest shareholders or owner groups in terms of votes (including both directly registered shareholders and custodian registered shareholders)  based on Euroclear Sweden AB‚Äôs extract of the share register as of 30 September each year  of which each will appoint one representative to  in addition to the chairman of the board of directors  constitute the nomination committee until a new nomination committee is appointed in accordance with these instructions. If any of the four largest shareholders or owner groups decline to exercise the right to appoint a representative  the fifth largest shareholder or owner group shall be given the opportunity to exercise such right  and so on until the nomination committee consists of five members. The majority of the members of the nomination committee shall be independent in relation to the Company and the Company‚Äôs management. At least one of the members of the nomination committee shall be independent in relation to the Company‚Äôs largest shareholder or group of shareholders  in terms of votes  working together with the administration of the Company. The CEO or any another member of the Company‚Äôs management must not be a member of the nomination committee. Members of the board of directors may be appointed to the nomination committee but are not to constitute a majority of its members. If more than one member of the board of directors is appointed to the nomination committee  no more than one member may be dependent in relation to the Company‚Äôs larger shareholders. The nomination committee appoints the chairman of the committee among themselves. The chairman of the board of directors or any other member of the board of directors may not be the chairman of the nomination committee. The composition of the nomination committee must be announced no later than six months prior to the annual general meeting. If earlier than two months prior to the annual general meeting  one or more of the shareholders having appointed representatives to the nomination committee is/are no longer among the four largest shareholders  representatives appointed by these shareholders shall resign and the shareholders who then are among the four largest shareholders may appoint their representatives. Should a member resign from the nomination committee before its work is completed and the nomination committee considers it necessary to replace him or her  such substitute member is to represent the same shareholder or  if the shareholder is no longer one of the four largest shareholders  the next largest shareholder in turn  in accordance with the principles above  but based on Euroclear Sweden AB‚Äôs transcription of the share register as soon as possible after the date the representative left the committee. Changes to the composition of the nomination committee must be announced immediately. Remuneration shall not be paid to the members of the nomination committee. The Company shall  however  pay any necessary expenses that the nomination committee may incur in its work. The term of office for the nomination committee ends when the composition of the following nomination committee has been announced. The nomination committee shall fulfil the tasks set out in the Swedish Corporate Governance Code and shall present proposals for the following resolutions at the annual general meeting: proposal for chairman of the meeting; proposal for the board of directors; proposal for chairman of the board of directors; proposal for auditors; proposal for remuneration for the board of directors  divided between the chairman and the other members of the board of directors and any remuneration for work in the committees; proposal for remuneration for the Company‚Äôs auditors; proposal for principles for appointing a nomination committee for the annual general meeting; and proposal for amendments of the instructions for the nomination committee. The nomination committee has the right  at Sinch's expense  to engage external consultants whom the nomination committee considers necessary to fulfil its task. Resolution on guidelines for compensation to senior executives (item 13) The board of directors proposes the following guidelines for compensation to senior executives. These guidelines do not apply to any remuneration resolved on or approved by a general meeting and constitute a framework under which remuneration to senior executives may be decided by the board of directors. The previous guidelines were approved by the annual general meeting in 2022. The reasons for the proposed changes are harmonization due to previous acquisitions and market conditions in various geographies in which the Company has significant operations  including the recent recruitment of a new CEO based in the United States. In summary  the proposed changes are: To adjust the short-term variable pay to not exceed 50 per cent of the fixed base pay (30 per cent in 2022).To introduce a special compensation to allow extraordinary incentives when hiring new and retaining existing members of the senior executives‚Äô team (see definition below).To adjust other benefits to not exceed 10 per cent of the fixed base pay (6 per cent in 2022).To adjust notice period and severance pay period for the CEO to not exceed 6 months‚Äô notice and 12 months‚Äô severance. The Company has not received any comments on the guidelines from any shareholders. For the purposes of these guidelines  the members of the senior executives‚Äô team consists of board members of the Company who are employed by group  the CEO  the deputy CEO (if applicable) and other members of the senior executives‚Äô team who report to the CEO. The senior executives‚Äô team currently comprises 12 senior executives  including the CEO. A prerequisite for the successful implementation of the Company‚Äôs business strategy and safeguarding of its long-term interests  including its sustainability  is that the Company is able to recruit and retain qualified personnel. Compensation to the CEO and other senior executives must therefore reflect Sinch‚Äôs need to recruit and motivate qualified employees by means of compensation packages perceived as fair and competitive. The board of directors is empowered to depart from the below guidelines if in a specific case there is a special cause for the deviation and a deviation is necessary to serve the Company‚Äôs long-term interests  including sustainability  or to ensure the Company‚Äôs financial viability. In the preparation of the board of directors‚Äô proposal for these guidelines for compensation to the CEO and other senior executives  salary and employment conditions for employees of the Company have been taken into account by including information on the employees‚Äô total remuneration  the components of the remuneration and increase and growth rate over time  in the board of directors‚Äô basis for its decision. Compensation consists of the following components: Fixed base payShort- and long-term variable paySpecial compensationPension benefitsOther benefitsPay during period of notice of termination or resignation Market based compensation The Company has acquired high quality benchmark data from third party sources to secure that compensation to the CEO and other senior executives reflects what is offered to executives in comparable positions in other companies. Market rate is also secured through recruitment processes  in the cases where executives are recruited externally. Fixed base pay The fixed base pay must be market based and reflect the employee‚Äôs position  qualifications  experience and individual performance. Short-term variable pay Short-term variable pay shall be measured against predefined financial performance targets. Non-financial objectives may also be used to sharpen focus on achieving the Company‚Äôs strategic plans. Objectives shall be specific  clear  measurable  subject to deadlines and adopted by the board of directors. They shall further be designed to contribute to the Company‚Äôs business strategy  long-term interests and sustainability. To which extent the criteria for awarding variable remuneration has been satisfied shall be evaluated/determined when the relevant measurement period has ended. The board of directors has delegated the responsibility for the evaluation so far as it concerns variable remuneration to the CEO and other senior executives to the remuneration committee. Levels and targets for variable pay are suggested annually by the CEO for other senior executives and approved by the board of directors. Levels and targets for the CEO are defined by the board of directors. Short-term variable pay may not exceed 50 per cent of the fixed base pay  as management compensation should be focused on long term incentives. Long-term variable pay Long-term variable pay may encompass share-related incentive programs. These guidelines do not apply to remuneration resolved on or approved by a general meeting. Accordingly  these guidelines do not apply to the Company‚Äôs share- related incentive programs LTI 2018  LTI 2019  LTI 2020  LTI II 2020  LTI 2021  LTI II 2021  LTI 2022 and the proposed LTI 2023. Each year  the board of directors evaluates whether a long-term share-related incentive program should be proposed to the annual general meeting. The purpose of offering a share-related incentive program is to ensure that the interests of senior executives coincide with those of the Company‚Äôs shareholders. Individual  long-term ownership among key individuals can be expected to stimulate keener interest in the business and its profitability  increase motivation  and enhance the sense of belonging with the Company and thereby contribute to the Company‚Äôs business strategy  long-term interests and sustainability. Long-term share-related incentives also helps to retain current executives and attract new executives when recruiting. Special compensation Additional variable cash compensation may be offered to key employees who remain employed in connection with acquisitions of new companies  divestments of businesses  other transitional activity or who perform other extraordinary work endeavours. Such special compensation may not exceed 50 per cent of the contracted annual fixed base salary. Special compensation may only be awarded in special cases and shall not be included in any ordinary compensation system. Decisions regarding special compensation shall always be made by the board of directors. Pensions Pension benefits for the CEO and other senior executives must reflect customary market terms  compared with what generally applies to executives in comparable positions in other companies  and should normally be based upon defined contribution pension plans. Retirement occurs at the relevant/applicable retirement age. Pension benefits may not exceed 35 per cent of the fixed base pay unless higher contributions follow from a pension plan pursuant to an applicable collective bargaining agreement. Other benefits Other continuous employee benefits may  among other things  consist of health insurance and fitness/wellness programs. The costs for such benefits may not exceed 10 per cent of the fixed base pay. Notice periods and severance pay As a general rule  employment agreements entered into between the Company and senior executives shall be on an indefinite basis. If the Company terminates the CEO‚Äôs employment  the period of notice shall be a maximum of six months. If the CEO resigns  the period of notice shall be six months. A period of notice applies between the Company and other senior executives of up to six months  whether the employee resigns or is terminated. In addition to compensation paid during the applicable period of notice  any severance pay after the applicable notice period shall not exceed an amount equivalent to the fixed base pay for 12 months for the CEO and 6 months for other senior executives. What is stated above constitutes a framework under which individual terms are to be resolved on by the board of directors. Compensation to founders of the Company Compensation to founders of the Company is subject to approval by the board of directors. Founders are excluded from the requirement of market-based pay  i.e. their compensation and benefits may be below market  as they are compensated through their ownership in the Company. Compensation to founders of the Company consists of the following components: Fixed base payPension benefitsAdditional vacation entitlementPay during period of notice of termination or resignation If a founder is temporarily covering another management position  the founder will be compensated during this period with a base pay equal to the person in the management team with the lowest salary at the time  excluding other founders. Approval Changes in terms  conditions and compensation to the CEO is subject to approval from the chairman of the board of directors. Day to day costs such as travel expenses for the CEO are approved by the CFO  and quarterly summaries are sent to the chairman of the board of directors. New recruitments  salary changes and other significant changes for other senior executives than the CEO are subject to approval from the chairman of the board of directors  whereas minor adjustments  and day to day costs are approved by the CEO. Payout of fixed base pay is prepared by local payroll departments and are approved before payout by the local HR representative. Payout of short-term variable pay is subject to approval from the CEO as regards other senior executives and from the chairman of the board of directors as regards the CEO. Eligibility for share-related incentive program must be approved by the board of directors based on the proposal approved at a general meeting. Controls and decision-making process The Company has a remuneration committee which consists of two members of the board of directors. The chairman of the board of directors is also chairman of the remuneration committee. The remuneration committee shall  in relation to the board of directors  have a preparatory function in respect of principles for remuneration  remuneration and other terms of employment regarding the senior executives. Consequently  the remuneration committee shall prepare a proposal in respect of guidelines for compensation to senior executives  which it shall present to the board of directors. The proposal shall then be presented to and resolved upon by the annual general meeting. The remuneration committee shall also evaluate the application of the guidelines resolved upon by the annual general meeting. The board of directors shall at least every fourth year or upon material changes to the guidelines make a proposal on guidelines to be resolved by the annual general meeting. The guidelines shall be applied in relation to every commitment on compensation to senior executives and every change in such commitment  which is resolved after the annual general meeting at which the guidelines were adopted. Thus  the guidelines have no impact on pre-existing contractually binding commitments. Guidelines resolved upon may also be amended by way of a resolution by any other general meeting. Further  the remuneration committee shall  within the scope of the guidelines resolved upon by the annual general meeting  prepare proposals regarding remuneration to the CEO and other senior executives. The board of directors shall annually evaluate the CEO‚Äôs performance. Further  the remuneration committee shall observe and evaluate programs for variable compensation to the senior executives which are ongoing or finished during the year as well as the Company‚Äôs current remuneration structure and remuneration levels. Furthermore  the remuneration committee shall annually prepare a remuneration report regarding the compensation to the senior executives. The remuneration report shall be made available to the shareholders on the Company‚Äôs website by the remuneration committee not later than three weeks prior to the annual general meeting. Within the scope and on the basis of the guidelines  the board of directors shall annually decide on the specific revised remuneration terms for each senior executive and make such other decisions on compensation to senior executives that may be required. The CEO or other senior executives shall not participate in the remuneration committee‚Äôs and the board of directors‚Äô processing of and resolutions regarding remuneration-related matters in so far as they are affected by such matters. Compliance with guidelines is controlled annually through the following activities: Collection of documented annual targets for short-term variable payRandom samples of salary payout approvalsSample reports from payroll systems to identify any out of the ordinary payouts The results of the controls are summarized and reported to the remuneration committee. Resolution on approval of the remuneration report (item 14) The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to approve the remuneration report pursuant to Chapter 8  Section 53 a of the Swedish Companies Act. Resolution on authorization for the board of directors to resolve on new issues of shares (item 15) The board of directors proposes that the meeting authorizes the board of directors to  on one or several occasions  until the next annual general meeting  resolve on new issues of shares to be paid in cash  in kind or by way of set-off or otherwise on terms and conditions and that such new issue can be performed with deviation from the shareholders‚Äô preferential rights. The issues are to be performed on market terms  taking into account any discount on market terms. The reason for the authorization and the reason for the possible deviation from the shareholders‚Äô preferential rights is to enable capital raisings for the acquisition of companies  or parts of companies  and for the operations of the Company. The board of directors is entitled to resolve on share issues causing an increase of the Company‚Äôs share capital of at most 10 per cent of the Company‚Äôs registered share capital at the time the board of directors first utilizes the authorization. Resolution on implementation of long-term incentive program 2023 (LTI 2023)  issue and transfer of warrants to participants in LTI 2023 and issue of warrants to secure delivery of shares upon exercise of employee stock options granted under LTI 2023 (item 16) Background and reasons Since the Company‚Äôs IPO in 2015  the Company has implemented several share-related incentive programs  of which one program  LTI 2016  has reached full maturity with no more outstanding warrants or employee stock options. In addition  the incentive program LTI 2018 will expire by the end of the second quarter of 2023. The board of directors considers it to be in the best interest of Sinch and its shareholders to implement an additional long-term incentive program (‚ÄúLTI 2023‚Äù) for senior executives  key personnel and other employees in the group  in accordance with this proposal. LTI 2023 is proposed to include up to approximately 925 current and future senior executives  key personnel and other employees within the Sinch group. The proposal has been based on the assessment of the board of directors that it is important  and in the interest of all shareholders  to create even greater participation in the group‚Äôs development for current and future senior executives  key personnel and employees of the group. The board of directors also considers it important to be able to attract talent over time  to encourage continued employment and to maintain a satisfactory employee retention level. In view of the above  the board of directors proposes that the general meeting resolves to implement the LTI 2023 in accordance with items (a)‚Äì(d) below. The resolutions under items (a)‚Äì(d) are proposed to be conditional upon each other and for that reason it is proposed that all resolutions are to be passed as one resolution. Item (a) ‚Äì Proposal on implementation of LTI 2023 LTI 2023 comprises five (5) Series. Series 1‚Äì3 consist of warrants (Sw. teckningsoptioner) to be transferred to members of the group management and selected key personnel  business unit management and key personnel and other personnel in Sweden. The warrants of Series 1 have a term of approximately 3.3 years  the warrants of Series 2 have a term of approximately four (4) years and the warrants of Series 3 have a term of approximately five (5) years. The holders can exercise the warrants to subscribe for shares during a period of three (3) months before the end of the term of each Series of warrants. Series 4 of LTI 2023 comprises employee stock options which may be granted to employees of the Sinch group outside Sweden. Series 5 of LTI 2023 comprises employee stock options which may be granted to members of the group management and selected key personnel  business unit management and key personnel and other personnel in Sweden. The board of directors proposes that the general meeting resolves to issue not more than 8 385 000 warrants in total. Pursuant to the resolution in item (b)  not more than 1 400 000 warrants may be issued in Series 1‚Äì3 (of which not more than 466 667 warrants may be issued in Series 1  not more than 466 667 warrants may be issued in Series 2 and not more than 466 666 warrants may be issued in Series 3). Further  pursuant to the resolution in items (c) and (d)  not more than 5 985 000 and 1 000 000 warrants may be issued in order to secure delivery of shares upon exercise of stock options to participants in  respectively  LTI 2023 Series 4 and 5. The right to subscribe for the warrants of Series 1‚Äì5 shall vest in the wholly-owned subsidiary Sinch Holding AB (the ‚ÄúSubsidiary‚Äù)  which shall transfer the warrants of Series 1‚Äì3 to members of the group management and selected key personnel  business unit management and key personnel and other personnel in Sweden  and hold warrants of Series 4 and 5 to secure delivery of shares upon exercise of stock options within the frame of LTI 2023 Series 4 and 5. Each warrant and stock option entitles the holder to subscribe for one (1) share in the Company. The warrants shall be issued without consideration to the Subsidiary. Below is a description of the principal terms and conditions for each of the LTI 2023 Series 1‚Äì5. Series 1‚Äì3 ‚Äì Warrants The Subsidiary will transfer the warrants in Series 1‚Äì3 to participants at a price corresponding to the market value of the warrants (the warrant premium). Each warrant of  respectively  Series 1  2 and 3 entitles the holder to subscribe for one (1) share in the Company during the exercise period for each respective Series at an exercise price corresponding to  respectively  130 per cent  140 per cent and 150 per cent of the volume-weighted average price for the Company‚Äôs share on Nasdaq Stockholm during the period from and including 4 May 2023 up to and including 17 May 2023 (rounded to the nearest full SEK 0.1  where SEK 0.05 shall be rounded up). However  the exercise price may not be less than the share‚Äôs quota value (currently SEK 0.01). Days without price quotation shall not be included in the calculation. The exercise periods for exercising the warrants for subscription of shares under each Series are as follows: Series 1: from and including 30 June 2026 up to and including 30 September 2026;Series 2: from and including 30 March 2027 up to and including 30 June 2027; andSeries 3: from and including 30 March 2028 up to and including 30 June 2028.

The board of directors of the Company shall be authorized to postpone the notification period during which notice of acquisition of warrants shall be made by participants. Warrants shall also be available to future new employees. For acquisitions made by future new employees  the terms shall be the same or equal to the terms that are set out in this resolution. This means  inter alia  that such acquisitions shall take place based on the market value of the warrants at such point in time  and that the board of directors shall set forth an equivalent notification period for new employees whose acquisitions take place after the initial notification period. The valuation of the warrants shall be made by an independent appraiser or audit firm. Since the warrants are acquired by the participants at market value  there are no performance conditions that need to be fulfilled in order to be offered to acquire warrants or in order to exercise warrants for subscription of shares. However  the Company will  in connection with the transfer of the warrants to the participants  reserve a pre-emption right regarding the warrants if the participant‚Äôs employment or assignment within the group is terminated or if the participant wishes to transfer its warrants.

Item (b) ‚Äì Proposal regarding issue and transfer of warrants of Series 1‚Äì3 to participants in LTI 2023 in Sweden The board of directors proposes that the Company shall issue not more than 1 400 000 warrants for subscription of shares  whereof not more than 466 667 warrants in Series 1  not more than 466 667 warrants in Series 2 and not more than 466 666 warrants in Series 3  whereby the Company‚Äôs share capital may be increased by not more than SEK 14 000 at full exercise of the warrants for subscription of shares  corresponding to approximately 0.17 per cent of the share capital in the Company as of the date of this proposal  being SEK 8 386 022.48. The right to subscribe for the warrants shall  with deviation from the shareholders‚Äô preferential rights  only vest in the Subsidiary  with the right and obligation to dispose of the warrants as set out in item (a) above. Each warrant entitles the holder to subscribe for one (1) share in the Company. The warrants will be issued without consideration to the Subsidiary. In order to fulfil the commitments arising from LTI 2023  the board of directors proposes that the general meeting authorizes that the Subsidiary may transfer warrants to participants  assign warrants to a third party  or in another way dispose over the warrants  in accordance with item (a). Detailed resolution proposals for each of the respective issues of warrants Series 1  2 and 3  including complete terms and conditions for the warrants  are set out in the board of directors' complete proposal (including its appendices). Item (c) ‚Äì Proposal on issue of warrants to secure delivery of shares upon exercise of employee stock options of Series 4 The board of directors proposes that the Company shall issue not more than 5 985 000 warrants in Series 4  whereby the Company‚Äôs share capital may be increased by not more than SEK 59 850 at full exercise of the warrants for subscription of shares  corresponding to approximately 0.71 per cent of the share capital in the Company as of the date of this proposal  being SEK 8 386 022.48. The right to subscribe for the warrants shall  with deviation from the shareholders‚Äô preferential rights  only vest in the Subsidiary  with the right and obligation to dispose of the warrants as further described above. Each warrant entitles the holder to subscribe for one (1) share in the Company during the period from and including the date of registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office (Sw. Bolagsverket) up to and including 31 December 2032  at an exercise price equal to the shares‚Äô quota value (currently SEK 0.01). The warrants shall be issued to the Subsidiary without consideration. In order to fulfil the commitments arising from LTI 2023  the board of directors proposes that the general meeting authorizes that the Subsidiary may transfer warrants to a third party  or otherwise dispose over the warrants  in accordance with item (a). A detailed resolution proposal for the issue of warrants Series 4  including complete terms and conditions for the warrants  is set out in the board of directors' complete proposal (including its appendices). Item (d) ‚Äì Proposal on issue of warrants to secure delivery of shares upon exercise of employee stock options of Series 5 The board of directors proposes that the Company shall issue not more than 1 000 000 warrants in Series 5  whereby the Company‚Äôs share capital may be increased by not more than SEK 10 000 at full exercise of the warrants for subscription of shares  corresponding to approximately 0.12 per cent of the share capital in the Company as of the date of this resolution proposal  being SEK 8 386 022.48. The right to subscribe for the warrants shall  with deviation from the shareholders‚Äô preferential rights  only vest in the Subsidiary  with the right and obligation to dispose of the warrants as further described above. Each warrant entitles the holder to subscribe for one (1) share in the Company during the period from and including the date of registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office (Sw. Bolagsverket) up to and including 31 December 2032  at an exercise price equal to the shares‚Äô quota value (currently SEK 0.01). The warrants shall be issued to the Subsidiary without consideration. In order to fulfil the commitments arising from LTI 2023  the board of directors proposes that the general meeting authorizes that the Subsidiary may transfer warrants to a third party  or otherwise dispose over the warrants  in accordance with item (a). A detailed resolution proposal for the issue of warrants Series 5  including complete terms and conditions for the warrants  is set out in the board of directors' complete proposal (including its appendices). Additional information regarding LTI 2023 Market value of warrants of Series 1‚Äì3 Based on a market value of the underlying share of SEK 28.0  the market value of the warrants of Series 1‚Äì3 is  in accordance with a preliminary valuation made by PwC  respectively  SEK 6.19  SEK 6.54 and SEK 7.15 per warrant of Series 1  2 and 3  assuming an exercise price of  respectively  SEK 36.40  SEK 39.20 and SEK 42.0 per share. The Black & Scholes valuation model has been used for the preliminary valuation of the warrants  assuming a risk-free interest of  respectively  2.68  2.56 and 2.40 per cent for warrants of Series 1  2 and 3  and an estimated volatility during the term of the warrants of approximately 40.0 per cent. Costs Given that the warrants of Series 1‚Äì3 shall be transferred at a price corresponding to the market value of the warrants  the Company estimates that no social security costs will arise for the Company in connection with the transfer of warrants to the participants. Neither should any social security costs arise in connection to the exercise of the warrants. The employee stock options Series 4 and 5 are expected to incur accounting costs (accounted for in accordance with the accounting standard IFRS 2) as well as social security costs during the term of the stock options. According to IFRS 2  the employee stock option costs shall be recorded as a personnel expense in the income statement during the vesting period. The total costs for employee stock options Series 4 and 5  calculated in accordance with IFRS 2  are estimated to amount to approximately SEK 53.0 million during the term of the program (excluding social security costs). The estimated costs have been calculated based on  inter alia  the following assumptions: (i) a market price of the Company‚Äôs share of SEK 28.0 at the time of grant  (ii) an estimated future volatility in respect of the Company‚Äôs share during the term of the stock options of 40.0 per cent  (iii) that the maximum number of stock options encompassed by this resolution proposal are granted to participants  (iv) expected time to exercise in accordance with IFRS 2  (v) an annual turnover of personnel of approximately 9.0 per cent based on historical data  and (vi) that all vested stock options are exercised. Social security costs  which are expected to arise primarily in connection to the exercise of stock options  are estimated to amount to approximately SEK 8.4 million during the term of the program  based on inter alia the assumptions set out under items (i)‚Äì(vi) above as well as an average social security rate of 7.1 per cent and an annual increase in the market price of the Company‚Äôs share of 15 per cent during the vesting period. Other costs related to the LTI 2023  including inter alia expenses related to fees to external advisors  external appraiser and administration of the incentive program  are estimated to amount to approximately SEK 2 million during the term of the program. Based on the assumptions set out above  the total costs of the LTI 2023 are estimated to approximately SEK 63.4 million in total during the term of the program. These costs shall be seen in relation to the tot¬≠al employee benefits expenses of the Sinch group  which during the financial year 2022 amounted to SEK 4 203 million. Dilution If all warrants/stock options within the frame of LTI 2023 are transferred or granted to participants and if all warrants/stock options are exercised  up to 8 385 000 shares may be issued  equivalent to a maximum dilution of approximately 0.99 per cent of the shares and votes of the Company. Upon full exercise of the warrants  the Company‚Äôs share capital will increase with SEK 83 850. Together with warrants and stock options which have been transferred or granted to participants in LTI 2018  LTI 2019  LTI 2020  LTI II 2020  LTI 2021  LTI II 2021 and LTI 2022 and which are outstanding as of the date of this resolution proposal  including warrants that have been exercised but where the shares have not yet been registered  the maximum dilution will amount to approximately 4.76 per cent of the shares and votes of the Company. The dilution calculations have been based on the maximum number of shares and votes which may be issued upon exercise of warrants and stock options  divided by the total number of shares and votes in the Company after such issues (based on the number of shares issued in the Company as of the date of this resolution proposal  being 838 602 248 shares). Motivation in respect of Series 4 stock option vesting and exercise conditions According to the Rules on Remuneration laid down by the Stock Market Self-Regulation Committee (Sw. Aktiemarknadens Sj√§lvregleringskommitt√©)  the vesting period  or the period between the date of grant until the date when a warrant or stock option may be exercised shall  as a general rule  not be shorter than three (3) years and any deviations from this general rule shall be justified. As set out further above  vesting of Series 4 employee stock options will start on the first anniversary of the date of grant of the stock options to participants  and on the third anniversary of the date of grant  up to 75 per cent of the employee stock options granted to a participant may have vested (provided that all applicable vesting conditions have then been fulfilled). Further  the vested stock options become exercisable soon after they have vested. The reason for applying such terms  which are not in line with the recommendations of the Stock Market Self-Regulation Committee as set out above  is that the board of directors of the Company consider such terms to be in line with market practice for employee stock option programs in most of the countries where the intended participants in Series 4 of LTI 2023 operate. It is therefore  in the opinion of the board of directors  in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders to apply such terms in order to fulfil the objectives of LTI 2023. Preparation of the proposal This proposal in respect of LTI 2023 has been prepared by the Company‚Äôs remuneration committee and board of directors in consultation with external advisers. The reason for the deviation from the shareholders‚Äô preferential rights The reason for the deviation from the shareholders‚Äô preferential rights is to implement LTI 2023. Majority requirements Since the resolutions under items (a)‚Äì(d) are conditional upon each other and passed as one resolution  a resolution to approve the proposal is valid only when supported by shareholders holding not less than nine-tenths (9/10) of the votes cast as well as the shares represented at the general meeting (as the transfer of warrants to participants under items (b)‚Äì(d) require such majority). Authorization It is proposed that the board of directors  or a person appointed by the board of directors  shall be authorized to make such minor adjustments to this resolution that may be required for the registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office (Sw. Bolagsverket) and Euroclear Sweden AB  and that the board of directors shall have the right to undertake minor adjustments to the incentive program due to applicable foreign rules and laws  applicable laws  regulations or market practice. Overview of outstanding incentive programs Since the Company‚Äôs IPO in 2015  the Company has implemented several share-related incentive programs  of which one program  LTI 2016  has reached full maturity with no more outstanding stock options or warrants.

Volume spikes tend to boost activity across trades processed by exchange operators.""There's rotation  the most obvious and public example of this is in the price action "" said Andrew Morgan  president at U.S.-based financial technology provider TS Imagine.""Exchange operators are data and technology businesses with defensive utility-like features  while banks are highly cyclical and exposed to idiosyncratic business model risks"".Equity trades across Euronext  which runs exchanges in seven big European centres from Paris to Amsterdam and Milan  reached the third-highest value in the company's history on March 17. Its average daily traded volumes in March were the highest in a year.Swiss exchange SIX  at the epicentre of the turmoil around UBS's rescue of Credit Suisse  had a 44.6% jump in March turnover compared with February. Cash market turnover at Deutsche Boerse rose 23.7% last month versus February.Story continuesAverage daily value traded at the London Stock Exchange (LSEG) rose 12.9% month-over-month in March. Thomson Reuters  which owns Reuters News  has been a shareholder in LSEG since 2021. LSEG also pays Reuters for news.(Graphic: Exchanges 1 - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/egpbylogdvq/Exchange%20operators%201.PNG)VOLATILITY BOOSTEvidence of any shift could be revealed when filings disclosing how mutual funds have tweaked their positions are published in a few weeks' time.UBS research that uses the bank's prime brokerage data and other sources showed in April that investor ""crowding"" in exchange operators' stocks has been recovering from four-year lows.Among financials in Europe  exchange stocks are the most positively correlated to volatility.Banking turmoil and option expiries drove the Euro STOXX volatility index last month to its highest since October in a steep surge that quickly pared back. The MOVE index  a gauge of fixed-income volatility  hit 2008 levels and remains high.""Investors tend to look at the exchanges as defensive names. In recessionary environments  we tend to see money being allocated increasingly to the exchanges "" said Micheal Werner  senior equity analyst at UBS in London.""The number of incoming calls I have had on the exchanges has certainly increased over the past two or three weeks as people are working at the allocations within the financial space of their portfolio "" he added.Werner said uncertainty over monetary policy should keep bond volatility elevated  supporting exchange stocks  while spikes in equity volatility tend to be bad for investment banking  M&A and customer fund flows at big universal banks.Deutsche Boerse has rallied more than 10% since the bank turmoil started in March with the collapse of U.S. regional bank SVB. Deutsche Boerse shares hit a lifetime high on Thursday.LSEG and Euronext have risen almost 8% and 4% respectively  while Amsterdam-based market maker Flow Traders  which also benefits from volatility  is up more than 13%.Over the same period  European banks have lost around 12%.Looking to the long term  some investors see the exchange industry benefiting from data demand.And exchange valuations are near multi-year lows which suggests any downside could be limited.Euronext trades at 14 times 12-month forward earnings and LSEG at 22 times  both an 18% discount to their five-year averages  as per Refinitiv Datastream.U.S. rival Nasdaq Inc trades on a multiple of 20  just a 3% discount to its 5-year average and Intercontinental Exchange Inc which trades on a multiple of 19  is 4.7% below its 5-year average.""Beyond being volatility beneficiaries  which makes them attractive within a diversified portfolio context  we also believe they are well-placed for data demand and consumption trends "" said Thomas McGarrity  head of equities at RBC Wealth Management. ""We continue to like exchange stocks.""(Graphic: Exchanges 2 - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/klpygmmxkpg/Exchange%20stocks%201.PNG)(Reporting by Danilo Masoni and Samuel Indyk.

The plan involves a capital increase of a maximum of ‚Ç¨150 million (inclusive of share premium) reserved for employees of French companies belonging to the Group  to be effected via a dedicated mutual fund (‚ÄúFCPE‚Äù)  the units in which are subject to a lock-up period of five years except where early release is allowed under the law. The effect will be the issuance of a maximum of 6 845 564 new Bouygues shares at a subscription price of ‚Ç¨21.912. The FCPE will exercise the voting rights attached to the newly issued shares.In accordance with provisions of the French Labour Code  the subscription price is equal to 70% of the average opening quoted market prices of the share on the twenty trading days preceding the date of the decision setting the opening date of the subscription period. The subscription period will run from 26 May to 12 June 2023 inclusive.The new shares to be issued will rank for dividend from 1 January 2023. They will be admitted for trading on the Euronext Paris market (on the same quotation line as existing Bouygues shares) as soon as possible after completion of the capital increase  which is scheduled for 27 June 2023. As a reminder  8 045 000 shares were cancelled in 2022  notably  in anticipation of this transaction.This plan gives Bouygues employees  including those of the recently integrated French entities belonging to Equans  a stake in the Group‚Äôs development and performance over the long term  and demonstrates yet again the proactive approach to employee share ownership which is a core component of the Group‚Äôs culture and values.ABOUT BOUYGUESBouygues is a diversified services group operating in over 80 countries with 196 000 employees all working to make life better every day.

Nevertheless  the supply chain disruption affecting electronic components resulted in the deferral of the delivery of two research systems to 2023  representing a total of ‚Ç¨2.9m  despite the Company‚Äôs efforts to diversify its sourcing capacity.In addition  RIBER has stopped marketing a range of evaporators for the OLED market.RevenuesIn this context  2022 full-year revenues came to ‚Ç¨27.8m  down -11% from 2021. Sales of MBE systems contracted -15% to ‚Ç¨14.8m  for six machines delivered  compared with eight in 2021. Sales of services and accessories are down -6% from a high basis for comparison to ‚Ç¨13.0m  representing 46.8% of 2022 revenues.EarningsThe gross margin came to ‚Ç¨9.8m  representing 35.2% of revenues  stable versus 2021(35.4%).Operating expenditure is stable (‚Ç¨9.8m). R&D investments totaled ‚Ç¨3.2m  representing 12% of revenues  stable compared with 2021. Sales and marketing costs are up (+18% in line with the strong growth in order intake)  while administrative costs are stable overall.Story continuesIncome from ordinary operations amounted to ‚Ç¨1.3m  comparable to 2021.Operating income broke even  compared with a ‚Ç¨1.3m profit in 2021. It is impacted by non-current charges for ‚Ç¨1.3m  in particular due to the decision to discontinue the OLED evaporator product line  which led to the depreciation of inventories.Net income totaled ‚Ç¨0.2m  compared with ‚Ç¨1.5m in 2021. In 2022  it included +‚Ç¨0.4m of financial income and expenses  linked primarily to the revaluation in euros of receivables denominated in US dollars and Yuan.Cash flow and balance sheetThe cash position at end-2022 was positive at ‚Ç¨6.1m  up +‚Ç¨0.2m from the end of 2021. This change reflects the good level of cash flow from operations and the improvement in working capital requirements.Net financial debt decreased to ‚Ç¨1.3m at December 31  2022  compared with ‚Ç¨2.4m one year earlier.Shareholders‚Äô equity totaled ‚Ç¨18.8m  down -‚Ç¨1.0m from end-2021. This change is linked to earnings for the year and the distribution of amounts drawn against the issue premium for 2021 to shareholders.Order bookDuring FY 2022  new order intake improved significantly  with 14 systems ordered over the period and a good level of orders recorded for services and accessories.This robust development helped significantly strengthen the order book at December 31  2022  up +102% to ‚Ç¨29.9m and including 11 MBE systems (‚Ç¨24.6m)  as well as orders for services and accessories (‚Ç¨5.3m).This order book does not include the additional order for a production system announced on February 20  2023  or the option to buy announced on June 8  2022 covering four production machines for which the firm orders will be confirmed in 2023 when the export license is obtained.OutlookIn view of these elements  RIBER is confident that it will be able to achieve revenues of around ‚Ç¨40m  driven by 40% growth compared with 2022. This growth in business is expected to be combined with a significant improvement in profitability.In a still buoyant market context  with robust demand for the Company‚Äôs systems  RIBER is expected to continue taking orders in 2023  capitalizing on a strong pipeline of prospects.Distribution of amounts drawn against the ‚Äúissue premium‚Äù accountIllustrating its confidence in the Company‚Äôs outlook  the Executive Board will submit a proposal to shareholders at the General Meeting on June 20  2023 to approve a cash payout based on reimbursing part of the issue premium for ‚Ç¨0.05 per share. It will be released for payment on July 5  2023.GovernanceDuring its meeting today  chaired by Ms Annie Geoffroy  RIBER‚Äôs Supervisory Board appointed Mr Christian Dupont as Chairman of the Company‚Äôs Executive Board from April 13  2023  replacing Mr Michel Picault  who is still a member of the Company‚Äôs Executive Board.This appointment will make it possible to ramp up RIBER's robust growth and expansion in a buoyant market environment.BiographyMr Christian Dupont  Chairman of RIBER‚Äôs Executive BoardAfter graduating as an engineer from EPFL (√âcole Polytechnique F√©d√©rale de Lausanne)  Mr Christian Dupont  59  began his career in 1988 with Texas Instruments  where in 1992 he helped create its Wireless business unit  which became the wireless semiconductor market leader for 15 years.

The full report is attached to this release and will be available on Volta‚Äôs website shortly (www.voltafinance.com).PERFORMANCE and PORTFOLIO ACTIVITYIncluding the dividend to be paid in April (but had record date in March) Volta Finance performance in March is -1.5% which is a relatively good performance in such context. For the first quarter of the year the performance stands at +5.8%  a very good start for 2023.Volta‚Äôs underlying sub asset classes monthly performances** were as follows: +0.8% for Bank Balance Sheet transactions  -2.8% for CLO Equity tranches  -3.4% for CLO Debt tranches; and +2.9% for Cash Corporate Credit and ABS (which represent circa 2.2% of the fund‚Äôs NAV).We highlighted in previous monthly reports that we have been building (and trading) a long duration overlay for several months. As explained  we are convinced that rates are globally back to levels from which one could anticipate interest rates cuts in reaction to potential economic shocks. This is exactly what happened in March with the Credit Suisse story and the bail-out of some US Regional banks: government bonds recorded solid performances on both sides of the Atlantic. As of the start of March  Volta overlay duration was in the area of 3 years (long US five-notes contracts and fixed receiver on European swaps) and it contributed to circa 2% of the March‚Äôs performance. As a result  we took some significant profits on this duration overlay  taking the overlay in the area of 1 year of duration at the end of March.Our view regarding the March events is as follow ‚Äì while the CS situation was very specific and should not spread to the wider European banking system  we believe that what happened with the US Regional banks is much more concerning. It is clear to us that there is a need for higher regulation there while the competition between US banks deposits and US monetary funds is much more acute than in Europe. Consequently  we may see some US regional banks pushed to reduce some of the support they used to provide to specific businesses in the quarters/years to come. The areas under most scrutiny seem to be the CREs one as well as local/small businesses  and it is reasonable to expect that a reduction in their financial support will have economic impacts. Access to credit may reduce while the cost of credit for a substantial chunk of the US economy will most likely be higher  although we expect this to be partially offset by lower-than-expected interest rates.Story continuesWe see no direct impact of these banking issues for CLOs. Underlying loan portfolios are located in SPVs (Special Purpose Vehicle) that sit outside banks‚Äô balance sheets. CS was a modest player in Loan origination and the US regional banks are not involved in US Loan origination either. CLOs holdings in US regional banks are also very modest (below 1.5% of the CLO market according to the research we read). The only area that may be under some pressure is the Middle Market CLO one. Indeed  companies that finance themselves through Middle Market loans are usually local and relatively small  hence most likely customers of regional banks (in the form of deposit  paycheck  revolver facilities  ‚Ä¶). There has been no particular market reaction and MML CLOs did not underperform their BSL cousins for now. Note that Volta do not own MML CLO debts and our exposure to MML CLO equity is 1.1% of NAV.March is a structurally weak month in terms of interest and cash flows collected from Volta‚Äôs assets: Volta received the equivalent of ‚Ç¨0.6m of interests and coupons. However  over the usual rolling 6-month time frame  Volta received ‚Ç¨22.1m of interests and coupons  ie. a 19.2% annualized cash flow to NAV.No significant purchases were made in March. We think that some pricing weakness on Loans will show in the coming months. Volta accumulated a bit of cash over the last 3 months  and we hope this will allow us to make some good investments  at a discount  in the coming weeks/months.As at the end of March 2023  Volta‚Äôs NAV was ‚Ç¨221.0m or ‚Ç¨6.04 per share.*It should be noted that approximately 6.99% of Volta‚Äôs GAV comprises investments for which the relevant NAVs as at the month-end date are normally available only after Volta‚Äôs NAV has already been published. Volta‚Äôs policy is to publish its NAV on as timely a basis as possible to provide shareholders with Volta‚Äôs appropriately up-to-date NAV information. Consequently  such investments are valued using the most recently available NAV for each fund or quoted price for such subordinated notes. The most recently available fund NAV or quoted price was 5.86% as at 28 February 2023  0.57% as at 31 January 2023  0.56% as at 30 September 2022.** ‚Äúperformances‚Äù of asset classes are calculated as the Dietz-performance of the assets in each bucket  taking into account the Mark-to-Market of the assets at period ends  payments received from the assets over the period  and ignoring changes in cross-currency rates. Nevertheless  some residual currency effects could impact the aggregate value of the portfolio when aggregating each bucket.CONTACTSFor the Investment ManagerAXA Investment Managers ParisSerge Demayserge.demay@axa-im.com+33 (0) 1 44 45 84 47Company Secretary and AdministratorBNP Paribas S.A  Guernsey Branchguernsey.bp2s.volta.cosec@bnpparibas.com+44 (0) 1481 750 853Corporate BrokerCenkos Securities plcAndrew WorneDaniel Balabanoff+44 (0) 20 7397 8900*****ABOUT VOLTA FINANCE LIMITEDVolta Finance Limited is incorporated in Guernsey under The Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 (as amended) and listed on Euronext Amsterdam and the London Stock Exchange's Main Market for listed securities.

The process is currently ongoing  and the Company has 24 months from the Settlement Date  plus an additional six months subject to approval by the General Meeting  to complete a Business Combination.The Company's business strategy is to identify  combine with and maximise the value of a Target with operations in the Energy Transition Sector. In executing this strategy  the Company will look for a Target that (i) complements the experience of the Founders (ii) can benefit from the Founders' operating and financial expertise and (iii) represents a compelling investment opportunity for the Company and its investors.If the Company identifies a suitable Target  the Company will enter into negotiations with the Target's current owners including  if appropriate  for the purpose of agreeing transaction documentation appropriate for the potential Business Combination.Assuming the transaction documentation is agreed  the Company will convene an extraordinary shareholder meeting and propose the Business Combination to the Shareholders (the ""Business Combination EGM""). The approval of the Business Combination will require a simple majority (over 50% of the votes cast on the Shares) approval of the General Meeting without any quorum requirement. Depending on the nature of the transaction  other resolutions may also need to be passed which could have a higher voting threshold and/or have a quorum requirement.Page | 3",neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,positive,0.66,0.33,0.0,True,English,"['Energy Transition Partners', 'Annual report', 'European single electronic reporting format', 'Energy Transition Partners B.V.', 'EnTra Acquisition B.V.', 'Energy Transition Sponsor LLP', 'Euronext Amsterdam N.V.', 'Energy Transition Sector', 'Special Purpose Acquisition Company', 'higher voting threshold', 'compelling investment opportunity', 'extraordinary shareholder meeting', 'additional six months', 'other mandatory statements', 'similar business combination', 'initial Business Combination', 'potential Business Combination', 'Business Combination EGM', 'one ordinary share', 'The ESEF version', 'potential target company', 'combination opportunity', 'asset acquisition', 'other resolutions', 'financial statements', 'General Meeting', 'share exchange', 'share purchase', '1101 CM Amsterdam', 'responsibility statement', 'accompanying notes', 'registered office', 'Luna ArenA', 'private placement', 'Public Warrants', 'financial expertise', 'current owners', 'simple majority', 'quorum requirement', 'Ordinary Shares', '2022 Annual Report', 'Settlement Date', 'business strategy', 'gross proceeds', 'transaction documentation', ""Founders' operating"", 'suitable Target', ""Directors' Report"", 'The Company', 'Board Report', '24 months', 'copy', 'RTS', 'Regulation', 'nl', 'year', 'December', '25 February', 'name', '10 March', 'Herikerbergweg', 'Netherlands', 'SPAC', 'merger', 'reorganisation', 'UK', 'geography', 'industry', 'trading', 'Admission', 'market', '19 July', 'Offering', 'accordance', 'terms', 'conditions', 'prospectus', '15 July', '17,500,000 units', 'one-third', 'price', 'Payment', '21 July', 'selection', 'process', 'approval', 'value', 'operations', 'experience', 'investors', 'negotiations', 'Shareholders', 'votes', 'nature', 'Page']",2023-04-14,2023-04-15,marketscreener.com

The plan involves a capital increase of a maximum of ‚Ç¨150 million (inclusive of share premium) reserved for employees of French companies belonging to the Group  to be effected via a dedicated mutual fund (‚ÄúFCPE‚Äù)  the units in which are subject to a lock-up period of five years except where early release is allowed under the law. The effect will be the issuance of a maximum of 6 845 564 new Bouygues shares at a subscription price of ‚Ç¨21.912. The FCPE will exercise the voting rights attached to the newly issued shares.In accordance with provisions of the French Labour Code  the subscription price is equal to 70% of the average opening quoted market prices of the share on the twenty trading days preceding the date of the decision setting the opening date of the subscription period. The subscription period will run from 26 May to 12 June 2023 inclusive.The new shares to be issued will rank for dividend from 1 January 2023. They will be admitted for trading on the Euronext Paris market (on the same quotation line as existing Bouygues shares) as soon as possible after completion of the capital increase  which is scheduled for 27 June 2023. As a reminder  8 045 000 shares were cancelled in 2022  notably  in anticipation of this transaction.This plan gives Bouygues employees  including those of the recently integrated French entities belonging to Equans  a stake in the Group‚Äôs development and performance over the long term  and demonstrates yet again the proactive approach to employee share ownership which is a core component of the Group‚Äôs culture and values.ABOUT BOUYGUESBouygues is a diversified services group operating in over 80 countries with 196 000 employees all working to make life better every day.

The plan involves a capital increase of a maximum of ‚Ç¨150 million (inclusive of share premium) reserved for employees of French companies belonging to the Group  to be effected via a dedicated mutual fund (‚ÄúFCPE‚Äù)  the units in which are subject to a lock-up period of five years except where early release is allowed under the law. The effect will be the issuance of a maximum of 6 845 564 new Bouygues shares at a subscription price of ‚Ç¨21.912. The FCPE will exercise the voting rights attached to the newly issued shares.In accordance with provisions of the French Labour Code  the subscription price is equal to 70% of the average opening quoted market prices of the share on the twenty trading days preceding the date of the decision setting the opening date of the subscription period. The subscription period will run from 26 May to 12 June 2023 inclusive.The new shares to be issued will rank for dividend from 1 January 2023. They will be admitted for trading on the Euronext Paris market (on the same quotation line as existing Bouygues shares) as soon as possible after completion of the capital increase  which is scheduled for 27 June 2023. As a reminder  8 045 000 shares were cancelled in 2022  notably  in anticipation of this transaction.This plan gives Bouygues employees  including those of the recently integrated French entities belonging to Equans  a stake in the Group‚Äôs development and performance over the long term  and demonstrates yet again the proactive approach to employee share ownership which is a core component of the Group‚Äôs culture and values.ABOUT BOUYGUESBouygues is a diversified services group operating in over 80 countries with 196 000 employees all working to make life better every day.

The approval process is expected to take around 12 months  leading to a potential launch of ZERVIATE in China in 2024. Ocumension plans to manufacture ZERVIATE in their new state-of-the-art purpose-built manufacturing facility located in Suzhou  China.‚ÄúOcumension is a strong partner for Nicox  and we are pleased to see the submission of this New Drug Application  following the completion of an additional Chinese Phase 3 trial carried out by Ocumension. Alongside a broad portfolio of ophthalmology assets in development  Ocumension has also built a commercial operation in China  which will be able to add ZERVIATE directly into their detailing activities upon approval.‚Äù said Gavin Spencer  Chief Business Officer of Nicox. ‚ÄúThe approval and launch of ZERVIATE in 2024 would add another royalty revenue stream to Nicox  on potential annual net sales which Ocumension forecasts will be over $100 million within 7 years in China. We look forward to Ocumension also expanding the availability of ZERVIATE to the other Southeast Asian markets they have rights to.‚Äù‚ÄúHaving built our development pipeline  Ocumension is now seeing the fruits of that pipeline as products arrive at commercialization. ZERVIATE is the first of these to come from our valuable collaboration with Nicox  and we look forward to following this with NCX 470 in glaucoma.‚Äù said Liu Ye  Chief Executive Officer of Ocumension Therapeutics.ZERVIATE is the first and only eye drop formulation of the antihistamine cetirizine  the active ingredient in ZYRTEC¬Æ  and is currently commercialized in the U.S. for ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis. The prescription market for allergic conjunctivitis products in China is expected to grow to almost $500 million by 2030.The ZERVIATE NDA in China is supported by the data package licensed by Nicox to Ocumension and an additional Chinese Phase 3 clinical trial of ZERVIATE run by Ocumension.

Nevertheless  the supply chain disruption affecting electronic components resulted in the deferral of the delivery of two research systems to 2023  representing a total of ‚Ç¨2.9m  despite the Company‚Äôs efforts to diversify its sourcing capacity.In addition  RIBER has stopped marketing a range of evaporators for the OLED market.RevenuesIn this context  2022 full-year revenues came to ‚Ç¨27.8m  down -11% from 2021. Sales of MBE systems contracted -15% to ‚Ç¨14.8m  for six machines delivered  compared with eight in 2021. Sales of services and accessories are down -6% from a high basis for comparison to ‚Ç¨13.0m  representing 46.8% of 2022 revenues.EarningsThe gross margin came to ‚Ç¨9.8m  representing 35.2% of revenues  stable versus 2021(35.4%).Operating expenditure is stable (‚Ç¨9.8m). R&D investments totaled ‚Ç¨3.2m  representing 12% of revenues  stable compared with 2021. Sales and marketing costs are up (+18% in line with the strong growth in order intake)  while administrative costs are stable overall.Income from ordinary operations amounted to ‚Ç¨1.3m  comparable to 2021.Operating income broke even  compared with a ‚Ç¨1.3m profit in 2021. It is impacted by non-current charges for ‚Ç¨1.3m  in particular due to the decision to discontinue the OLED evaporator product line  which led to the depreciation of inventories.Net income totaled ‚Ç¨0.2m  compared with ‚Ç¨1.5m in 2021. In 2022  it included +‚Ç¨0.4m of financial income and expenses  linked primarily to the revaluation in euros of receivables denominated in US dollars and Yuan.Cash flow and balance sheetThe cash position at end-2022 was positive at ‚Ç¨6.1m  up +‚Ç¨0.2m from the end of 2021. This change reflects the good level of cash flow from operations and the improvement in working capital requirements.Net financial debt decreased to ‚Ç¨1.3m at December 31  2022  compared with ‚Ç¨2.4m one year earlier.Shareholders‚Äô equity totaled ‚Ç¨18.8m  down -‚Ç¨1.0m from end-2021. This change is linked to earnings for the year and the distribution of amounts drawn against the issue premium for 2021 to shareholders.Order bookDuring FY 2022  new order intake improved significantly  with 14 systems ordered over the period and a good level of orders recorded for services and accessories.This robust development helped significantly strengthen the order book at December 31  2022  up +102% to ‚Ç¨29.9m and including 11 MBE systems (‚Ç¨24.6m)  as well as orders for services and accessories (‚Ç¨5.3m).This order book does not include the additional order for a production system announced on February 20  2023  or the option to buy announced on June 8  2022 covering four production machines for which the firm orders will be confirmed in 2023 when the export license is obtained.OutlookIn view of these elements  RIBER is confident that it will be able to achieve revenues of around ‚Ç¨40m  driven by 40% growth compared with 2022.

Nevertheless  the supply chain disruption affecting electronic components resulted in the deferral of the delivery of two research systems to 2023  representing a total of ‚Ç¨2.9m  despite the Company‚Äôs efforts to diversify its sourcing capacity.In addition  RIBER has stopped marketing a range of evaporators for the OLED market.RevenuesIn this context  2022 full-year revenues came to ‚Ç¨27.8m  down -11% from 2021. Sales of MBE systems contracted -15% to ‚Ç¨14.8m  for six machines delivered  compared with eight in 2021. Sales of services and accessories are down -6% from a high basis for comparison to ‚Ç¨13.0m  representing 46.8% of 2022 revenues.EarningsThe gross margin came to ‚Ç¨9.8m  representing 35.2% of revenues  stable versus 2021(35.4%).Operating expenditure is stable (‚Ç¨9.8m). R&D investments totaled ‚Ç¨3.2m  representing 12% of revenues  stable compared with 2021. Sales and marketing costs are up (+18% in line with the strong growth in order intake)  while administrative costs are stable overall.Income from ordinary operations amounted to ‚Ç¨1.3m  comparable to 2021.Operating income broke even  compared with a ‚Ç¨1.3m profit in 2021. It is impacted by non-current charges for ‚Ç¨1.3m  in particular due to the decision to discontinue the OLED evaporator product line  which led to the depreciation of inventories.Net income totaled ‚Ç¨0.2m  compared with ‚Ç¨1.5m in 2021. In 2022  it included +‚Ç¨0.4m of financial income and expenses  linked primarily to the revaluation in euros of receivables denominated in US dollars and Yuan.Cash flow and balance sheetThe cash position at end-2022 was positive at ‚Ç¨6.1m  up +‚Ç¨0.2m from the end of 2021. This change reflects the good level of cash flow from operations and the improvement in working capital requirements.Net financial debt decreased to ‚Ç¨1.3m at December 31  2022  compared with ‚Ç¨2.4m one year earlier.Shareholders‚Äô equity totaled ‚Ç¨18.8m  down -‚Ç¨1.0m from end-2021. This change is linked to earnings for the year and the distribution of amounts drawn against the issue premium for 2021 to shareholders.Order bookDuring FY 2022  new order intake improved significantly  with 14 systems ordered over the period and a good level of orders recorded for services and accessories.This robust development helped significantly strengthen the order book at December 31  2022  up +102% to ‚Ç¨29.9m and including 11 MBE systems (‚Ç¨24.6m)  as well as orders for services and accessories (‚Ç¨5.3m).This order book does not include the additional order for a production system announced on February 20  2023  or the option to buy announced on June 8  2022 covering four production machines for which the firm orders will be confirmed in 2023 when the export license is obtained.OutlookIn view of these elements  RIBER is confident that it will be able to achieve revenues of around ‚Ç¨40m  driven by 40% growth compared with 2022. This growth in business is expected to be combined with a significant improvement in profitability.In a still buoyant market context  with robust demand for the Company‚Äôs systems  RIBER is expected to continue taking orders in 2023  capitalizing on a strong pipeline of prospects.Distribution of amounts drawn against the ‚Äúissue premium‚Äù accountIllustrating its confidence in the Company‚Äôs outlook  the Executive Board will submit a proposal to shareholders at the General Meeting on June 20  2023 to approve a cash payout based on reimbursing part of the issue premium for ‚Ç¨0.05 per share.

That transaction lifted Flutter‚Äôs stake in the business to 95 per cent.Flutter EntertainmentThe Fastball Holdings consortium is also made up of CapitalG  the investments arm of Google‚Äôs parent Alphabet  NBC Sports Group  Comcast Ventures  Verizon Ventures and Shamrock Capital.READ MOREThis week‚Äôs share sale enable Fastball to generate ‚Ç¨328 million through the placing of 2.2 million shares at ¬£149.10 each.Dublin-headquartered Flutter Entertainment  the owner of Paddy Power  Betfair  Sky Bet  FanDuel and Sportsbet in Australia  said in February that it was looking at taking on a stock market quotation in the US  home of its fastest-growing business.‚ÄòDysfunctional and illogical‚Äô: Developer Michael O‚ÄôFlynn on Republic's new vacant land tax Listen | 46:13The merger of Paddy Power with Betfair in early 2016 meant the combined entity opted for London for its main listing ‚Äîbefore it changed its name to Flutter. It has a secondary listing in Dublin.The expectation is that Flutter will eventually move its main listing to the US ‚Äî similar to a plan being pursued by CRH  the building materials giant.Huge successCRH  which moved its main listing from Dublin to London a decade ago  confirmed to The Irish Times last week that it plans to drop its quotation on the Irish market in order to give it a better chance of it being added to key US stock market indices. The company is known to be chasing inclusion in the S&P 500 index  which is widely followed by US institutional investors.Flutter said in a circular sent to investors ahead of its upcoming annual general meeting on April 27th that it ‚Äúwould like to maintain the flexibility‚Äù to continue to trade on both the London Stock Exchange and Euronext Dublin following a US listing  either on the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq.

The full report is attached to this release and will be available on Volta‚Äôs website shortly (www.voltafinance.com).PERFORMANCE and PORTFOLIO ACTIVITYIncluding the dividend to be paid in April (but had record date in March) Volta Finance performance in March is -1.5% which is a relatively good performance in such context. For the first quarter of the year the performance stands at +5.8%  a very good start for 2023.Volta‚Äôs underlying sub asset classes monthly performances** were as follows: +0.8% for Bank Balance Sheet transactions  -2.8% for CLO Equity tranches  -3.4% for CLO Debt tranches; and +2.9% for Cash Corporate Credit and ABS (which represent circa 2.2% of the fund‚Äôs NAV).We highlighted in previous monthly reports that we have been building (and trading) a long duration overlay for several months. As explained  we are convinced that rates are globally back to levels from which one could anticipate interest rates cuts in reaction to potential economic shocks. This is exactly what happened in March with the Credit Suisse story and the bail-out of some US Regional banks: government bonds recorded solid performances on both sides of the Atlantic. As of the start of March  Volta overlay duration was in the area of 3 years (long US five-notes contracts and fixed receiver on European swaps) and it contributed to circa 2% of the March‚Äôs performance. As a result  we took some significant profits on this duration overlay  taking the overlay in the area of 1 year of duration at the end of March.Our view regarding the March events is as follow ‚Äì while the CS situation was very specific and should not spread to the wider European banking system  we believe that what happened with the US Regional banks is much more concerning. It is clear to us that there is a need for higher regulation there while the competition between US banks deposits and US monetary funds is much more acute than in Europe. Consequently  we may see some US regional banks pushed to reduce some of the support they used to provide to specific businesses in the quarters/years to come. The areas under most scrutiny seem to be the CREs one as well as local/small businesses  and it is reasonable to expect that a reduction in their financial support will have economic impacts. Access to credit may reduce while the cost of credit for a substantial chunk of the US economy will most likely be higher  although we expect this to be partially offset by lower-than-expected interest rates.We see no direct impact of these banking issues for CLOs. Underlying loan portfolios are located in SPVs (Special Purpose Vehicle) that sit outside banks‚Äô balance sheets. CS was a modest player in Loan origination and the US regional banks are not involved in US Loan origination either. CLOs holdings in US regional banks are also very modest (below 1.5% of the CLO market according to the research we read). The only area that may be under some pressure is the Middle Market CLO one. Indeed  companies that finance themselves through Middle Market loans are usually local and relatively small  hence most likely customers of regional banks (in the form of deposit  paycheck  revolver facilities  ‚Ä¶). There has been no particular market reaction and MML CLOs did not underperform their BSL cousins for now. Note that Volta do not own MML CLO debts and our exposure to MML CLO equity is 1.1% of NAV.March is a structurally weak month in terms of interest and cash flows collected from Volta‚Äôs assets: Volta received the equivalent of ‚Ç¨0.6m of interests and coupons. However  over the usual rolling 6-month time frame  Volta received ‚Ç¨22.1m of interests and coupons  ie. a 19.2% annualized cash flow to NAV.No significant purchases were made in March. We think that some pricing weakness on Loans will show in the coming months. Volta accumulated a bit of cash over the last 3 months  and we hope this will allow us to make some good investments  at a discount  in the coming weeks/months.As at the end of March 2023  Volta‚Äôs NAV was ‚Ç¨221.0m or ‚Ç¨6.04 per share.*It should be noted that approximately 6.99% of Volta‚Äôs GAV comprises investments for which the relevant NAVs as at the month-end date are normally available only after Volta‚Äôs NAV has already been published. Volta‚Äôs policy is to publish its NAV on as timely a basis as possible to provide shareholders with Volta‚Äôs appropriately up-to-date NAV information. Consequently  such investments are valued using the most recently available NAV for each fund or quoted price for such subordinated notes. The most recently available fund NAV or quoted price was 5.86% as at 28 February 2023  0.57% as at 31 January 2023  0.56% as at 30 September 2022.** ‚Äúperformances‚Äù of asset classes are calculated as the Dietz-performance of the assets in each bucket  taking into account the Mark-to-Market of the assets at period ends  payments received from the assets over the period  and ignoring changes in cross-currency rates. Nevertheless  some residual currency effects could impact the aggregate value of the portfolio when aggregating each bucket.CONTACTSFor the Investment ManagerAXA Investment Managers ParisSerge Demayserge.demay@axa-im.com+33 (0) 1 44 45 84 47Company Secretary and AdministratorBNP Paribas S.A  Guernsey Branchguernsey.bp2s.volta.cosec@bnpparibas.com+44 (0) 1481 750 853Corporate BrokerCenkos Securities plcAndrew WorneDaniel Balabanoff+44 (0) 20 7397 8900*****ABOUT VOLTA FINANCE LIMITEDVolta Finance Limited is incorporated in Guernsey under The Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 (as amended) and listed on Euronext Amsterdam and the London Stock Exchange's Main Market for listed securities.

The Guinness owner aims to remove itself from the Dublin and Paris stock exchanges by the end of May  pending regulatory approval. In truth  that approval is a fait accompli.,The Irish Stock Exchange doomsayers were given another boost this week as Diageo became the latest company to drop its listing on what is now known as Euronext Dublin.The Guinness owner aims to remove itself from the Dublin and Paris stock exchanges by the end of May  pending regulatory approval. In truth  that approval is a fait accompli.Diageo is the latest in a line of firms to leave the market here: CRH is in the process of doing so as it seeks a deeper investor pool in the US  while Greencore and C&C have both upped sticks in recent years. Combine those with the loss of Green Reit and Hibernia Reit to acquisitions  and speculation about Paddy Power owner Flutter‚Äôs future trading home  and it‚Äôs grim times for the Dublin market.Diageo isn‚Äôt like the others though. The company‚Äôs shares haven‚Äôt traded here for many years. It may be a ‚Ç¨32 billion business but  according to the Euronext Dublin website  it last traded on the Irish Stock Exchange on March 27th  2002. Yes  21 years ago. In short  this is hardly a blow to the market‚Äôs day-to-day business  and the administrative costs associated with maintaining a listing that goes unused make cutting it an easy decision for any company. Indeed  one wonders why it didn‚Äôt happen earlier.READ MOREThe symbolism though  is strong. Apart from the visual of yet another company pulling its shares from the market  it also is another loosening of the ties between Diageo and Ireland. Sure  anyone who gets off the train at Heuston Station can see the scale of the operations in Dublin  but there is no getting away from the fact that what was once an Irish champion company is now primarily Irish in branding terms only.That isn‚Äôt a bad thing ‚Äì Diageo‚Äôs scale has opened new markets to Guinness  Baileys and a host of other products to great success. But we‚Äôre now a very long way from the days of the Lady Patricia and Miranda Guinness running back and forth across the Irish Sea.,neutral,0.01,0.93,0.05,mixed,0.19,0.05,0.75,True,English,"['Irish Stock Exchange', 'Diageo', 'The Irish Stock Exchange doomsayers', 'Paddy Power owner Flutter', 'Paris stock exchanges', 'The Guinness owner', 'deeper investor pool', 'future trading home', 'Irish champion company', 'Euronext Dublin website', 'Irish Sea', 'C&C', 'recent years', 'Green Reit', 'Hibernia Reit', 'many years', '‚Ç¨32 billion business', 'day business', 'administrative costs', 'easy decision', 'Heuston Station', 'branding terms', 'bad thing', 'new markets', 'other products', 'great success', 'Lady Patricia', 'Miranda Guinness', 'latest company', 'regulatory approval', 'Dublin market', 'boost', 'Diageo', 'listing', 'end', 'May', 'truth', 'fait', 'line', 'firms', 'CRH', 'process', 'Greencore', 'sticks', 'loss', 'acquisitions', 'speculation', 'times', 'others', 'shares', 'March', 'blow', 'READ', 'symbolism', 'visual', 'loosening', 'ties', 'Ireland', 'train', 'scale', 'operations', 'fact', 'Baileys', 'host', 'long', 'days']",2023-04-15,2023-04-15,irishtimes.com

A n activist investor in Ires Reit published an open letter in part criticising the market for poor liquidity ,The Irish Stock Exchange (ISE) was dealt yet another blow to its diminishing status this week.An activist investor in Ires Reit published an open letter in part criticising the market for poor liquidity  limited options for raising equity  and an undersized universe of investors.The institution  Canada‚Äôs Vision Capital  was mainly taking aim at the board of Ires  which it alleges has not been responsive to shareholders and should take the undervalued company off-market by selling to a private buyer.Calling Ires Reit ‚Äúa failure on all fronts‚Äù  Vision‚Äôs CEO Jeffrey Olin told the Irish Independent this week that listing in Dublin was ‚Äúa nice concept but it didn‚Äôt work‚Äù.If Olin gets his wish  the ISE will lose its last Reit and yet another name from the main market.And he's not the only one disappointed at how things are going on the equities side of Euronext Dublin  the trading name for the ISE since it was sold in 2018.Earlier in the spring  two of its biggest components ‚Äì building materials giant CRH and Paddy Power owner Flutter ‚Äì announced plans to seek listings in New York.It is likely their shareholders will approve  and two Irish homegrown global brands will decamp with hopes of joining the S&P 500 index  taking their massive share of trading volumes with them for access to greenbacks.Earlier in the spring  CRH and Flutter announced plans to seek listings in New YorkThey would only be joining an exodus that has been years in the making.ISE stalwarts Grafton Group  DCC  C&C and Greencore have all surrendered their Dublin listings in recent years  despite all being Irish headquartered major corporations.And then there are the privatisations: Green Reit  Hibernia Reit  Yew Grove Reit  Applegreen and CPL. All of them took offers from private buyers in the last five years and with them went the bulk of the big post-crisis IPO companies.Only two companies have come the other way: UK shopping centre owner Hammerson  which sought a secondary listing in Dublin to diversify its shareholder base after Brexit  and Ryanair  which dropped its London listing for regulatory reasons.Meanwhile  the flow of initial public offerings has been desperately disappointing. Except for Uniphar  which has had an active market presence since listing in 2019  just a few tiddlers like Corre Energy  Healthbeacon and Engage XR have come to market in recent years.While small growing firms are the lifeblood of any exchange  the volume arriving on Euronext Dublin is too little to counterbalance the losses at the top.Efforts to attract more IPO candidates  like Euronext‚Äôs IPO Ready programme  are valiant but almost completely unsuccessful to date.The flow of initial public offerings has been desperately disappointingAnd hopes that Dublin would become a key entry point for global capital looking to trade European shares proved perhaps a little over-excited.To be sure  there was a post-Brexit spike in trading volumes for some big stocks like Smurfit Kappa and Ryanair  with Dublin taking the bulk of trading.This was great news  especially for stockbrokers Davy and Goodbody who depend in part on having a vibrant equity market in their home town  but the impending losses of CRH and Flutter can‚Äôt be rationalised as anything other than a disaster in terms of prestige and earning opportunities.Both companies are big users of the capital markets  raising billions to fund acquisitions and ambitious growth plans. But both also correctly recognise that the biggest pool of investors is also in their biggest consumer market  the USA.But the trouble at Ires hints at something more fundamental than the decision of two global scale firms deciding that New York is their kind of town.The company  Ireland‚Äôs largest private landlord  was supposed to be tailor-made for the Irish Stock Exchange. The fact that a ground-floor investor like Vision is calling time on the experiment with Irish real estate equities ‚Äì at the height of a major housing crunch ‚Äì should be a wake-up-to-reality call.The trouble at Ires hints at something more fundamentalVision didn‚Äôt pull punches  calling trading volumes ‚Äúexceedingly low‚Äù and equity issuance ‚Äúcumbersome  costly  time-consuming and relatively inefficient‚Äù.If that‚Äôs the book on Euronext Dublin  it should come as no surprise that companies like Galway‚Äôs Ocean Harvest went to London‚Äôs AIM this week. Or that Cathal Friel‚Äôs Raglan Capital has a singular focus on bring its stable of life sciences company to the Nasdaq  where the hope is that they can show a little leg to the right suitor and make big-time cash.It‚Äôs hard not to look at the dire state of the equity market and conclude that Euronext bought the Irish Stock Exchange exclusively for its world-leading and perennially successful funds and debt securities markets.Unfortunately  those don‚Äôt serve the local capital ecosystem  which appears to be withering.,neutral,0.02,0.97,0.02,mixed,0.09,0.03,0.87,True,English,"['Irish Stock Exchange', 'Trading places', 'big guns', 'money', 'two Irish homegrown global brands', 'UK shopping centre owner', 'two global scale firms', 'Irish real estate equities', 'Paddy Power owner Flutter', 'The Irish Stock Exchange', 'big post-crisis IPO companies', 'small growing firms', 'S&P 500 index', 'initial public offerings', 'IPO Ready programme', 'key entry point', 'perennially successful funds', 'major housing crunch', 'debt securities markets', 'largest private landlord', 'Yew Grove Reit', 'local capital ecosystem', 'CEO Jeffrey Olin', 'active market presence', 'ambitious growth plans', 'life sciences company', 'last five years', 'biggest consumer market', 'vibrant equity market', 'global capital', 'two companies', 'Irish Independent', 'equities side', 'IPO candidates', 'last Reit', 'capital markets', 'big stocks', 'big users', 'major corporations', 'private buyer', 'biggest components', 'biggest pool', 'Green Reit', 'Hibernia Reit', 'Raglan Capital', 'diminishing status', 'activist investor', 'open letter', 'poor liquidity', 'limited options', 'undersized universe', 'nice concept', 'main market', 'building materials', 'New York', 'massive share', 'Grafton Group', 'C&C', 'recent years', 'shareholder base', 'regulatory reasons', 'Corre Energy', 'Engage XR', 'European shares', 'post-Brexit spike', 'Smurfit Kappa', 'great news', 'stockbrokers Davy', 'earning opportunities', 'ground-floor investor', 'reality call', 'equity issuance', 'Ocean Harvest', 'Cathal Friel', 'singular focus', 'little leg', 'right suitor', 'big-time cash', 'dire state', 'trading volumes', 'secondary listing', 'home town', 'impending losses', 'Ires Reit', 'Vision Capital', 'giant CRH', 'trading name', 'Euronext Dublin', 'London listing', 'Dublin listings', 'ISE', 'blow', 'part', 'investors', 'institution', 'Canada', 'aim', 'board', 'shareholders', 'failure', 'fronts', 'wish', 'things', 'spring', 'hopes', 'access', 'greenbacks', 'exodus', 'making', 'DCC', 'Greencore', 'privatisations', 'Applegreen', 'CPL', 'offers', 'bulk', 'Hammerson', 'Ryanair', 'flow', 'Uniphar', 'tiddlers', 'Healthbeacon', 'lifeblood', 'top', 'Efforts', 'Goodbody', 'disaster', 'terms', 'prestige', 'billions', 'acquisitions', 'USA', 'trouble', 'something', 'decision', 'kind', 'Ireland', 'fact', 'experiment', 'height', 'punches', 'book', 'Galway', 'stable', 'Nasdaq', 'world-leading']",2023-04-15,2023-04-15,independent.ie
