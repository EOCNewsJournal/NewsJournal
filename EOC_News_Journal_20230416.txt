23030,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2023/04/15/diageo-finally-quits-irish-stock-exchange/,Diageo finally quits Irish Stock Exchange,Guinness owner’s move is another loosening of its ties to Ireland,The Irish Stock Exchange doomsayers were given another boost this week as Diageo became the latest company to drop its listing on what is now known as Euronext Dublin.The Guinness owner aims to remove itself from the Dublin and Paris stock exchanges by the end of May  pending regulatory approval. In truth  that approval is a fait accompli.Diageo is the latest in a line of firms to leave the market here: CRH is in the process of doing so as it seeks a deeper investor pool in the US  while Greencore and C&C have both upped sticks in recent years. Combine those with the loss of Green Reit and Hibernia Reit to acquisitions  and speculation about Paddy Power owner Flutter’s future trading home  and it’s grim times for the Dublin market.Diageo isn’t like the others though. The company’s shares haven’t traded here for many years. It may be a €32 billion business but  according to the Euronext Dublin website  it last traded on the Irish Stock Exchange on March 27th  2002. Yes  21 years ago. In short  this is hardly a blow to the market’s day-to-day business  and the administrative costs associated with maintaining a listing that goes unused make cutting it an easy decision for any company. Indeed  one wonders why it didn’t happen earlier.READ MOREThe symbolism though  is strong. Apart from the visual of yet another company pulling its shares from the market  it also is another loosening of the ties between Diageo and Ireland. Sure  anyone who gets off the train at Heuston Station can see the scale of the operations in Dublin  but there is no getting away from the fact that what was once an Irish champion company is now primarily Irish in branding terms only.That isn’t a bad thing – Diageo’s scale has opened new markets to Guinness  Baileys and a host of other products to great success. But we’re now a very long way from the days of the Lady Patricia and Miranda Guinness running back and forth across the Irish Sea.,neutral,0.01,0.93,0.05,mixed,0.19,0.05,0.75,True,English,"['Irish Stock Exchange', 'Diageo', 'The Irish Stock Exchange doomsayers', 'Paddy Power owner Flutter', 'Paris stock exchanges', 'The Guinness owner', 'deeper investor pool', 'future trading home', 'Irish champion company', 'Euronext Dublin website', 'Irish Sea', 'C&C', 'recent years', 'Green Reit', 'Hibernia Reit', 'many years', '€32 billion business', 'day business', 'administrative costs', 'easy decision', 'Heuston Station', 'branding terms', 'bad thing', 'new markets', 'other products', 'great success', 'Lady Patricia', 'Miranda Guinness', 'latest company', 'regulatory approval', 'Dublin market', 'boost', 'Diageo', 'listing', 'end', 'May', 'truth', 'fait', 'line', 'firms', 'CRH', 'process', 'Greencore', 'sticks', 'loss', 'acquisitions', 'speculation', 'times', 'others', 'shares', 'March', 'blow', 'READ', 'symbolism', 'visual', 'loosening', 'ties', 'Ireland', 'train', 'scale', 'operations', 'fact', 'Baileys', 'host', 'long', 'days']",2023-04-15,2023-04-16,irishtimes.com
23031,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.independent.ie/business/irish/trading-places-irish-stock-exchange-withers-as-big-guns-follow-the-money-42433470.html,Trading places – Irish Stock Exchange withers as big guns follow the money,The Irish Stock Exchange (ISE) was dealt yet another blow to its diminishing status this week.,The Irish Stock Exchange (ISE) was dealt yet another blow to its diminishing status this week.An activist investor in Ires Reit published an open letter in part criticising the market for poor liquidity  limited options for raising equity  and an undersized universe of investors.The institution  Canada’s Vision Capital  was mainly taking aim at the board of Ires  which it alleges has not been responsive to shareholders and should take the undervalued company off-market by selling to a private buyer.Calling Ires Reit “a failure on all fronts”  Vision’s CEO Jeffrey Olin told the Irish Independent this week that listing in Dublin was “a nice concept but it didn’t work”.If Olin gets his wish  the ISE will lose its last Reit and yet another name from the main market.And he's not the only one disappointed at how things are going on the equities side of Euronext Dublin  the trading name for the ISE since it was sold in 2018.Earlier in the spring  two of its biggest components – building materials giant CRH and Paddy Power owner Flutter – announced plans to seek listings in New York.It is likely their shareholders will approve  and two Irish homegrown global brands will decamp with hopes of joining the S&P 500 index  taking their massive share of trading volumes with them for access to greenbacks.Earlier in the spring  CRH and Flutter announced plans to seek listings in New YorkThey would only be joining an exodus that has been years in the making.ISE stalwarts Grafton Group  DCC  C&C and Greencore have all surrendered their Dublin listings in recent years  despite all being Irish headquartered major corporations.And then there are the privatisations: Green Reit  Hibernia Reit  Yew Grove Reit  Applegreen and CPL. All of them took offers from private buyers in the last five years and with them went the bulk of the big post-crisis IPO companies.Only two companies have come the other way: UK shopping centre owner Hammerson  which sought a secondary listing in Dublin to diversify its shareholder base after Brexit  and Ryanair  which dropped its London listing for regulatory reasons.Meanwhile  the flow of initial public offerings has been desperately disappointing. Except for Uniphar  which has had an active market presence since listing in 2019  just a few tiddlers like Corre Energy  Healthbeacon and Engage XR have come to market in recent years.While small growing firms are the lifeblood of any exchange  the volume arriving on Euronext Dublin is too little to counterbalance the losses at the top.Efforts to attract more IPO candidates  like Euronext’s IPO Ready programme  are valiant but almost completely unsuccessful to date.The flow of initial public offerings has been desperately disappointingAnd hopes that Dublin would become a key entry point for global capital looking to trade European shares proved perhaps a little over-excited.To be sure  there was a post-Brexit spike in trading volumes for some big stocks like Smurfit Kappa and Ryanair  with Dublin taking the bulk of trading.This was great news  especially for stockbrokers Davy and Goodbody who depend in part on having a vibrant equity market in their home town  but the impending losses of CRH and Flutter can’t be rationalised as anything other than a disaster in terms of prestige and earning opportunities.Both companies are big users of the capital markets  raising billions to fund acquisitions and ambitious growth plans. But both also correctly recognise that the biggest pool of investors is also in their biggest consumer market  the USA.But the trouble at Ires hints at something more fundamental than the decision of two global scale firms deciding that New York is their kind of town.The company  Ireland’s largest private landlord  was supposed to be tailor-made for the Irish Stock Exchange. The fact that a ground-floor investor like Vision is calling time on the experiment with Irish real estate equities – at the height of a major housing crunch – should be a wake-up-to-reality call.The trouble at Ires hints at something more fundamentalVision didn’t pull punches  calling trading volumes “exceedingly low” and equity issuance “cumbersome  costly  time-consuming and relatively inefficient”.If that’s the book on Euronext Dublin  it should come as no surprise that companies like Galway’s Ocean Harvest went to London’s AIM this week. Or that Cathal Friel’s Raglan Capital has a singular focus on bring its stable of life sciences company to the Nasdaq  where the hope is that they can show a little leg to the right suitor and make big-time cash.It’s hard not to look at the dire state of the equity market and conclude that Euronext bought the Irish Stock Exchange exclusively for its world-leading and perennially successful funds and debt securities markets.Unfortunately  those don’t serve the local capital ecosystem  which appears to be withering.,neutral,0.02,0.97,0.02,mixed,0.09,0.03,0.87,True,English,"['Irish Stock Exchange', 'Trading places', 'big guns', 'money', 'two Irish homegrown global brands', 'UK shopping centre owner', 'two global scale firms', 'Irish real estate equities', 'Paddy Power owner Flutter', 'The Irish Stock Exchange', 'big post-crisis IPO companies', 'small growing firms', 'S&P 500 index', 'initial public offerings', 'IPO Ready programme', 'key entry point', 'perennially successful funds', 'major housing crunch', 'debt securities markets', 'largest private landlord', 'Yew Grove Reit', 'local capital ecosystem', 'CEO Jeffrey Olin', 'active market presence', 'ambitious growth plans', 'life sciences company', 'last five years', 'biggest consumer market', 'vibrant equity market', 'global capital', 'two companies', 'Irish Independent', 'equities side', 'IPO candidates', 'last Reit', 'capital markets', 'big stocks', 'big users', 'major corporations', 'private buyer', 'biggest components', 'biggest pool', 'Green Reit', 'Hibernia Reit', 'Raglan Capital', 'diminishing status', 'activist investor', 'open letter', 'poor liquidity', 'limited options', 'undersized universe', 'nice concept', 'main market', 'building materials', 'New York', 'massive share', 'Grafton Group', 'C&C', 'recent years', 'shareholder base', 'regulatory reasons', 'Corre Energy', 'Engage XR', 'European shares', 'post-Brexit spike', 'Smurfit Kappa', 'great news', 'stockbrokers Davy', 'earning opportunities', 'ground-floor investor', 'reality call', 'equity issuance', 'Ocean Harvest', 'Cathal Friel', 'singular focus', 'little leg', 'right suitor', 'big-time cash', 'dire state', 'trading volumes', 'secondary listing', 'home town', 'impending losses', 'Ires Reit', 'Vision Capital', 'giant CRH', 'trading name', 'Euronext Dublin', 'London listing', 'Dublin listings', 'ISE', 'blow', 'part', 'investors', 'institution', 'Canada', 'aim', 'board', 'shareholders', 'failure', 'fronts', 'wish', 'things', 'spring', 'hopes', 'access', 'greenbacks', 'exodus', 'making', 'DCC', 'Greencore', 'privatisations', 'Applegreen', 'CPL', 'offers', 'bulk', 'Hammerson', 'Ryanair', 'flow', 'Uniphar', 'tiddlers', 'Healthbeacon', 'lifeblood', 'top', 'Efforts', 'Goodbody', 'disaster', 'terms', 'prestige', 'billions', 'acquisitions', 'USA', 'trouble', 'something', 'decision', 'kind', 'Ireland', 'fact', 'experiment', 'height', 'punches', 'book', 'Galway', 'stable', 'Nasdaq', 'world-leading']",2023-04-15,2023-04-16,independent.ie
