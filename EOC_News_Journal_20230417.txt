23040,EuroNext,Bing API,https://www.natlawreview.com/article/how-dutch-companies-are-responding-to-gender-diversity-requirement-supervisory,How Dutch Companies Are Responding to the Gender Diversity Requirement for Supervisory Boards,The Dutch Senate’s act on gender diversity in Dutch company boards (the Act) took effect 1 January 2022. One of the Act’s provisions implements an appointment quota for supervisory boards ,Monday  April 17  2023The Dutch Senate’s act on gender diversity in Dutch company boards (the Act) took effect 1 January 2022. One of the Act’s provisions implements an appointment quota for supervisory boards  or non-executive directors in a one-tier model  of Dutch-listed companies to ensure that men and women each hold at least one-third of the seats on the supervisory board. Any appointment after 1 January 2022 that does not contribute to a more balanced gender ratio is null and void. Since the introduction of this legislation  some companies have struggled with this requirement and use a flexible interpretation of the rules.The Dutch Parliament agreed with the Senate that diversity in the workforce  especially at the C-level  can lead to more balanced decision-making and help companies achieve their business goals. The Act is currently applicable only to the supervisory board in a two-tier governance model or the non-executive board in a one-tier governance model. The Dutch Female Board Index publishes an annual survey of female executive and supervisory board members in listed companies. This index is based on annual assessments of the Dutch trade register. In 2022  the percentage of female supervisory board members increased from 33% to 38% compared to the previous year. Of the 89 Dutch-listed companies  72 now meet the quota.Pursuant to the Act  a supervisory board is considered ‘balanced’ if at least one-third of the members are women and at least one-third are men. If the one-third calculation is a fraction  the number will always be rounded up. Therefore  as an example  in a board of 10 members  at least four need to be women and at least four need to be men. The Act provides that if the composition is not in line with the minimum requirements  the board is ‘unbalanced’. Any new appointment of a supervisory director in an already unbalanced board that does not contribute to a more balanced composition is null and void. In such instances  the position remains vacant. An exception to this rule is if existing supervisory board members are re-appointed within eight years of their original appointment or in case of appointments made under exceptional circumstances.The Act  and particularly the risk of nullity in case of an appointment that does not meet the Act’s requirements  causes uncertainty for companies that currently have an unbalanced board and where the tenure of serving board members comes to an end. The following recent case studies provide insight into how companies are interpreting and dealing with the Act.Just Eat Take Away N.V.(listed at Euronext): The supervisory board consisted of five members  four men and one woman. Therefore  the supervisory board qualified as unbalanced under the Act. Two new members were on the short list for nomination  one man and one woman  resulting in a supervisory board of seven members  five men and two women. Thus  the board remained unbalanced. Given the principle that in case of fractions when determining the one-third minimum requirement  the number should be rounded up  the board should comprise four men and three women  or vice versa  to qualify as balanced under the Act. In order to comply with the Act and avoid the risk of the male member’s appointment being nullified  the company tweaked the sequence of the appointments. The agenda for the general meeting of the company provided that the female board member was appointed first. Upon the appointment of the female board member  the requirement of one-third female was met  and the board qualified as balanced with four men and two women. The company then voted on the appointment of the male supervisory board member. Even though the company ended up with an unbalanced board  the risk of nullity was circumvented because under a strict interpretation of the Act  a balanced board can convert into an unbalanced board if any next nomination meets the Act’s quota requirement.ING Groep N.V.(listed at Euronext): The ING supervisory board comprised nine members  three women and six men. The chairman of the board (male) was set to be replaced by an outside successor  also male  while one of the female board members had come to the end of her tenure and would be replaced by another woman. The company envisaged that the current chairman would stay on to make sure the incoming chairman could familiarize himself with the company. However  this would have resulted in a board of 10 members  seven men and only three women. However  in order to comply with the Act  ING appointed the female board member  and the existing chairman resigned from his position  allowing the board to remain balanced with six male and three female members. Because ING faces significant public scrutiny  they acted well within the confines of the Act  rather than testing its limits.ConclusionCompanies should carefully consider the nature  extent  and limits of the Act when nominating and appointing new members in order to maintain a balanced gender ratio on supervisory boards and avoid the risk of new appointments being nullified.,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,negative,0.01,0.07,0.93,True,English,"['Gender Diversity Requirement', 'Dutch Companies', 'Supervisory Boards', 'The Dutch Female Board Index', 'female supervisory board members', 'existing supervisory board members', 'The Dutch Parliament', 'Dutch trade register', 'significant public scrutiny', 'two-tier governance model', 'The Dutch Senate', 'female board member', 'one-tier governance model', 'balanced gender ratio', 'Groep N.V.', 'three female members', 'recent case studies', 'Dutch company boards', 'Two new members', 'one-third minimum requirement', 'one-tier model', 'female executive', 'supervisory boards', 'one-third female', 'existing chairman', 'balanced board', 'supervisory director', 'balanced decision-making', 'five members', 'seven members', 'nine members', 'six male', 'non-executive board', 'gender diversity', 'The Act', 'non-executive directors', 'flexible interpretation', 'business goals', 'annual survey', 'annual assessments', 'previous year', 'four need', 'minimum requirements', 'eight years', 'exceptional circumstances', 'short list', 'one man', 'general meeting', 'strict interpretation', 'outside successor', 'two women', 'balanced composition', 'three women', 'current chairman', 'incoming chairman', 'one-third calculation', 'four men', 'one woman', 'five men', 'six men', 'seven men', 'new appointment', 'next nomination', 'quota requirement', 'Dutch-listed companies', 'original appointment', 'appointment quota', '10 members', 'appointments', 'Monday', 'April', 'effect', 'provisions', 'seats', '1 January', 'introduction', 'legislation', 'rules', 'workforce', 'C-level', 'percentage', 'fraction', 'number', 'example', 'line', 'instances', 'risk', 'nullity', 'uncertainty', 'tenure', 'insight', 'Euronext', 'principle', 'order', 'sequence', 'agenda', 'confines', 'limits', 'Conclusion', 'nature', 'extent']",2023-04-17,2023-04-17,natlawreview.com
