We were able to complete the Phase 2-3 COVA clinical trial and report positive results from the study demonstrating the effect of Sarconeos (BIO101) in the treatment of severe forms of COVID-19. The statistically significant 44% reduction in the risk of respiratory failure or early death is a very important result for patients as COVID-19 continues to be a major health problem  with over 40 000 deaths in 2022 according to Santé Publique France. Confident in the therapeutic potential of Sarconeos (BIO101)  we have pursued the implementation of an EAP  with the objective of providing access to Sarconeos (BIO101) to a few thousand COVID-19 patients hospitalised in Brazil and France in the second half of 2023. In parallel  we are preparing for the filing of a conditional marketing authorisation (CMA) in Europe and an emergency use authorisation (EUA) in the US.Story continuesThe end of the clinical development phase and the start of the regulatory process of this COVA project in COVID-19 means that our financing needs are decreasing.We are now entering a new era  with the opportunity to generate the first revenues from our research investment as early as the second half of 2023.In parallel  we will continue to carry on the company's other projects (sarcopenia - SARA  Duchenne muscular dystrophy - MYODA and AMD - MACA) while remaining frugal with our financial and human resources.In a global context that remains very challenging for biotech companies  we will continue to be highly adaptive to pursue the development of our pipeline of drug candidates with very limited resources  without losing sight of our main objective which is to obtain conditional marketing approvals for Sarconeos (BIO101) in the treatment of Covid-19 and to generate our first revenues in the early access program as early as 2023.""Major operational milestones achieved in 2022:The company focused its human and financial resources on completing the COVA phase 2-3 study in COVID-19  reporting its results and preparing an early access programme for Sarconeos (BIO101)As regards to our global Phase 2-3 COVA study in COVID-19Enrolment of the study stopped in April 2022 after the 237th patient had been enrolled;Discharge of the last COVA patient in June 2022  locking of the clinical database and analysis of results in August 2022;Reporting of promising first trial results in September 2022;Reporting of the positive post-hoc analysis of the phase 2-3 COVA study strongly supporting the therapeutic potential of Sarconeos (BIO101) in severe forms of COVID-19 in November 2022;Publication of positive final study results in February 2023 demonstrating that the clinical study met the primary endpoint with a 44% reduction in the risk of early death and respiratory failure.As regards to the preparation of the early access program for Sarconeos (BIO101) for the treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patientsObtaining early access approval in February 2022 for critical COVID-19 patients in Brazil;Preparing the industrialization of Sarconeos (BIO101) in view of the early access program in Brazil and France.Scientific communication in international congresses of the main results of the SARA (Sarcopenia) and MYODA (Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy) programs.SARA: Presentation of the main clinical results of phase 2 SARA-INT at the ICFSR in Boston  USA  in April 2022 and of the possible design of phase 3 at the SCWD in Lisbon  Portugal  in June 2022MYODA: Presentation of new preclinical efficacy data for Sarconeos (BIO101) in SMA (Spinal Muscular Atrophy) at the SMA Cure 2022 conference in Anaheim  California  U.S.2023 outlook and perspectives:For the COVAstudy in COVID-19:The Company has initiated the regulatory development process with a view to marketing Sarconeos (BIO101) in severe forms of COVID-19.To accelerate the availability of this treatment  an early access program has been initiated in France and Brazil. In France  a pre-filing meeting with the French Health Authority was held in March and the Company plans to file this application in the second quarter of 2023  with the objective of starting this program in the second half of this year. In Brazil  the Company continues to re-initiate the early access program  which was suspended at the end of the COVA clinical trial in mid-2022  pending final efficacy and safety results. These programs should enable the treatment of a few thousand COVID-19 patients in hospital and thus generate the first revenues for the company from 2023 on.In parallel  the Company is preparing the conditional marketing authorizatioń application in Europe and due to the health emergency in the United States that we expect to submit in 2023  depending on the feedback from regulatory agencies. In addition  the Company has started the industrialization of the production of Sarconeos (BIO101) in order to complete the regulatory file for the marketing authorization application and with a view to commercialization in 2024.For the SARA study in Sarcopenia:Following the first Type C meeting with the FDA in January 2022  a scientific advice meeting was held with the EMA to discuss the Phase 3 protocol  targeting a similar population and endpoints as the Phase 2 study. We have continued to engage with the FDA and EMA throughout 2022 and have defined the protocol for the Phase 3 study. We now plan to seek approval to initiate a Phase 3 clinical trial in Europe and the US from the relevant regulatory authorities (EMA and FDA) in the second quarter of 2023. We are also actively seeking industrial partners interested in co-developing Sarconeos (BIO101) in this indication.For the MYODAstudy in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD):Following the receipt of an ""Authorization to Proceed"" (IND - Investigational New Drug) letter from the FDA (USA) in December 2019  Biophytis received authorization from the Belgian FAMHP in March 2021 to continue its Sarconeos (BIO101) clinical study in non-ambulatory patients with DMD. However  due to the COVID-19 crisis and its impact on our operational capabilities  the MYODA study was postponed. We have thoroughly revised the protocol and propose a phase 1/2 study for non-ambulatory DMD patients with signs of deteriorating lung function.We expect to submit this new protocol to the competent authorities in the second half of 2023.Annual 2022 Financial ResultsThe Company's annual 2022 non-audited consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS were reviewed by the Company's Board of Directors on April 14  2023.

Resulting majorly from the variation of the fair value as calculated using IFRS 9  for our various convertible financing instruments  respectively Atlas and Kreos.• Net Loss. Net loss was €24.2 million for 2022  as compared to €31.2 million for 2021. Net loss per share (based on weighted-average number of shares outstanding over the period except the treasury shares) was €0.14 in 2022 compared to €0.26 in 2021.****About BIOPHYTISBiophytis SA is a clinical-stage biotechnology company specialized in the development of therapeutics that are aimed at slowing the degenerative processes associated with aging and improving functional outcomes for patients suffering from age-related diseases  including severe respiratory failure in patients suffering from COVID-19.

The presentations include clinical and real-world efgartigimod data that demonstrate the potential of neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) blockade in transforming treatment for gMG and other IgG-mediated autoimmune diseases.“Our presentations at AAN will showcase the depth of evidence we are generating in support of the clinical and real-world profile of efgartigimod to address the often-underappreciated needs of people living with gMG ” said Luc Truyen  M.D. Ph.D.  Chief Medical Officer  argenx. “We have a unique opportunity to recalibrate expectations for patients and their supporters by setting a new standard for what ‘well-controlled’ means in gMG and across autoimmunity more broadly.”Power of Individualized Dosing from Long-term Extension StudiesThe presentations include results from the open-label extension studies of VYVGART® (efgartigimod alfa-fcab) and subcutaneous (SC) efgartigimod following long-term treatment in ADAPT+ (217.5 patient-years follow-up) and ADAPT-SC+ (72 patient-years follow-up). Long-term treatment  administered in individualized dosing cycles  led to consistent and repeatable reductions in IgG antibody levels and improved clinical outcomes.A cross-indication review of the safety profile of efgartigimod will also be presented across multiple IgG-mediated autoimmune diseases  reinforcing the consistent safety profile observed with efgartigimod.Potential in Patients Early in gMG Disease CourseA new exploratory analysis will be presented from the ADAPT Phase 3 trial showing that a greater percentage of gMG patients with fewer than three years disease duration were responders and achieved minimum symptom expression (MSE) compared with placebo.Story continuesNew Opportunities with Patient Support ProgramsAs part of its commitment to address access for gMG patients impacted by social determinants of health challenges  argenx will present quantitative and qualitative research that identified potential opportunities to expand patient support program offerings  including the establishment of an information hotline and symptom tracking app  a patient mentoring program  an innovative giving strategy and broadened awareness campaigns of nurse case manager services.Details for the poster presentations are as follows:Title: Long-Term Safety  Tolerability  And Efficacy of Efgartigimod in Patients with Generalized Myasthenia Gravis: Concluding Analyses from the ADAPT+Session Date & Time: Oral Presentation - Sunday  April 23 at 2:00pm ETPresenter: Dr. Mamatha PasnoorAbstract Number: S5.006Title: Long-Term Safety  Tolerability  and Efficacy of Subcutaneous Efgartigimod PH20 in Patients with Generalized Myasthenia Gravis: Interim Results of the ADAPT-SC+ StudySession Date & Time: Poster Session 1  Sunday  April 23  8-9 am ETPresenter: Dr. James F.

For more information related to VYVGART in Japan  visit argenx.jp.Important Safety Information for VYVGART® (efgartigimod alfa-fcab) intravenous (IV) formulation (U.S. prescribing information)What is VYVGART® (efgartigimod alfa-fcab)?VYVGART is a prescription medicine used to treat a condition called generalized myasthenia gravis  which causes muscles to tire and weaken easily throughout the body  in adults who are positive for antibodies directed toward a protein called acetylcholine receptor (anti-AChR antibody positive).What is the most important information I should know about VYVGART?VYVGART may cause serious side effects  including:Infection. VYVGART may increase the risk of infection. In a clinical study  the most common infections were urinary tract and respiratory tract infections. More patients on VYVGART vs placebo had below normal levels for white blood cell counts  lymphocyte counts  and neutrophil counts. The majority of infections and blood side effects were mild to moderate in severity. Your health care provider should check you for infections before starting treatment  during treatment  and after treatment with VYVGART. Tell your health care provider if you have any history of infections. Tell your health care provider right away if you have signs or symptoms of an infection during treatment with VYVGART such as fever  chills  frequent and/or painful urination  cough  pain and blockage of nasal passages/sinus  wheezing  shortness of breath  fatigue  sore throat  excess phlegm  nasal discharge  back pain  and/or chest pain.Undesirable immune reactions (hypersensitivity reactions). VYVGART can cause the immune system to have undesirable reactions such as rashes  swelling under the skin  and shortness of breath. In clinical studies  the reactions were mild or moderate and occurred within 1 hour to 3 weeks of administration  and the reactions did not lead to VYVGART discontinuation. Your health care provider should monitor you during and after treatment and discontinue VYVGART if needed. Tell your health care provider immediately about any undesirable reactions.Before taking VYVGART  tell your health care provider about all of your medical conditions  including if you:Have a history of infection or you think you have an infection.Have received or are scheduled to receive a vaccine (immunization). Discuss with your health care provider whether you need to receive age-appropriate immunizations before initiation of a new treatment cycle with VYVGART. The use of vaccines during VYVGART treatment has not been studied  and the safety with live or live-attenuated vaccines is unknown. Administration of live or live-attenuated vaccines is not recommended during treatment with VYVGART.Are pregnant or plan to become pregnant and are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed.Tell your health care provider about all the medicines you take  including prescription and over- the-counter medicines  vitamins  and herbal supplements.What are the common side effects of VYVGART?The most common side effects of VYVGART are respiratory tract infection  headache  and urinary tract infection.These are not all the possible side effects of VYVGART. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to the US Food and Drug Administration at 1- 800-FDA-1088.Please see the full Prescribing Information for VYVGART and talk to your doctor.About Generalized Myasthenia GravisGeneralized myasthenia gravis (gMG) is a rare and chronic autoimmune disease where IgG autoantibodies disrupt communication between nerves and muscles  causing debilitating and potentially life-threatening muscle weakness. Approximately 85% of people with MG progress to gMG within 24 months  where muscles throughout the body may be affected. Patients with confirmed AChR antibodies account for approximately 85% of the total gMG population.About VYVGART® (efgartigimod alfa-fcab)VYVGART is a human IgG1 antibody fragment that binds to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)  resulting in the reduction of circulating immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoantibodies. It is the first and only approved FcRn blocker. VYVGART is approved in the United States and Europe for the treatment of adults with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive and in Japan for the treatment of adults with gMG who do not have sufficient response to steroids or non-steroidal immunosuppressive therapies (ISTs). VYVGART is being studied in adults with primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and other IgG autoantibody-mediated diseases.About argenxargenx is a global immunology company committed to improving the lives of people suffering from severe autoimmune diseases.

The US regulatory body had requested this additional data while considering market approval for Maxigesic® IV  a novel  dual mode-of-action non-opioid pain treatment delivered through intravenous (IV) infusion.The submission of an additional Extractable & Leachable data set follows a Complete Response Letter received in July 2022 regarding the assessment of the primary packaging  in essence the vial and the vial’s stopper in which the drug product is stored. Importantly  the FDA did not report any issues related to the data generated during the clinical development program.The formal response to the Complete Response Letter was filed with the FDA on 17 April 2023. Assuming a positive assessment by the FDA  this implies potential registration of Maxigesic® IV for the US market before year end.Sales could follow soon after  with an exclusive license and distribution agreement already signed between AFT and Hikma Pharmaceuticals (“Hikma”). Hikma is a leading supplier of complex  injectable hospital products in the U.S.Under the terms of the development collaboration agreement between Hyloris and AFT  Hyloris is eligible to receive a share on any product-related revenues  such as license fees  royalties  milestone payments  received by AFT.Stijn Van Rompay  Chief Executive Officer of Hyloris  commented: “We are excited to unlock the potential of Maxigesic® IV to improve patients’ lives in the biggest health care market in the world. We expect the data we have submitted will satisfy the FDA’s requirements.”Story continues“In the United States  new persistent opioid use can be considered one of the most common complications after elective surgery  occurring in 5.9% to 6.5% of cases1. This societal problem impacts many American lives in a tragic way. There is an urgent need for safer and more effective non-opioid pain treatments in a hospital setting to avoid triggering addiction in patients. Maxigesic® IV holds the promise of becoming a valuable pain treatment option without the side effects and risk of addiction associated with opioids.”About Maxigesic® IVMaxigesic® IV is a novel  dual mode-of-action  non-opioid pain treatment for use post-operatively in hospitals or when patients cannot take medicine orally. It is a unique combination of 1000mg paracetamol with 300mg ibuprofen solution for infusion  thereby reducing both pain and inflammation.Results from a randomized  placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial demonstrated that Maxigesic® IV was well-tolerated and had a faster onset of action  offered higher pain relief  and provided the potential to reduce the use of opioids compared to ibuprofen IV or paracetamol IV alone in the same doses. Further exposure studies have demonstrated the drug’s efficacy and safety in an expanded population group over a longer treatment period. Maxigesic® IV is protected by several granted and pending patent applications.About Hyloris PharmaceuticalsHyloris is a specialty biopharma company focused on innovating  reinventing  and optimizing existing medications to address important healthcare needs and deliver relevant improvements for patients  healthcare professionals and payors.

The US regulatory body had requested this additional data while considering market approval for Maxigesic® IV  a novel  dual mode-of-action non-opioid pain treatment delivered through intravenous (IV) infusion.The submission of an additional Extractable & Leachable data set follows a Complete Response Letter received in July 2022 regarding the assessment of the primary packaging  in essence the vial and the vial’s stopper in which the drug product is stored. Importantly  the FDA did not report any issues related to the data generated during the clinical development program.The formal response to the Complete Response Letter was filed with the FDA on 17 April 2023. Assuming a positive assessment by the FDA  this implies potential registration of Maxigesic® IV for the US market before year end.Sales could follow soon after  with an exclusive license and distribution agreement already signed between AFT and Hikma Pharmaceuticals (“Hikma”). Hikma is a leading supplier of complex  injectable hospital products in the U.S.Under the terms of the development collaboration agreement between Hyloris and AFT  Hyloris is eligible to receive a share on any product-related revenues  such as license fees  royalties  milestone payments  received by AFT.Stijn Van Rompay  Chief Executive Officer of Hyloris  commented: “We are excited to unlock the potential of Maxigesic® IV to improve patients’ lives in the biggest health care market in the world. We expect the data we have submitted will satisfy the FDA’s requirements.”“In the United States  new persistent opioid use can be considered one of the most common complications after elective surgery  occurring in 5.9% to 6.5% of cases1. This societal problem impacts many American lives in a tragic way. There is an urgent need for safer and more effective non-opioid pain treatments in a hospital setting to avoid triggering addiction in patients. Maxigesic® IV holds the promise of becoming a valuable pain treatment option without the side effects and risk of addiction associated with opioids.”About Maxigesic® IVMaxigesic® IV is a novel  dual mode-of-action  non-opioid pain treatment for use post-operatively in hospitals or when patients cannot take medicine orally. It is a unique combination of 1000mg paracetamol with 300mg ibuprofen solution for infusion  thereby reducing both pain and inflammation.Results from a randomized  placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial demonstrated that Maxigesic® IV was well-tolerated and had a faster onset of action  offered higher pain relief  and provided the potential to reduce the use of opioids compared to ibuprofen IV or paracetamol IV alone in the same doses. Further exposure studies have demonstrated the drug’s efficacy and safety in an expanded population group over a longer treatment period. Maxigesic® IV is protected by several granted and pending patent applications.About Hyloris PharmaceuticalsHyloris is a specialty biopharma company focused on innovating  reinventing  and optimizing existing medications to address important healthcare needs and deliver relevant improvements for patients  healthcare professionals and payors. Hyloris has built a broad  patented portfolio of 16 reformulated and repurposed value-added medicines that have the potential to offer significant advantages over available alternatives. Outside of its core strategic focus  the Company also has 3 high barrier generic products in development.Two products are currently in initial phases of commercialization with partners: Sotalol IV for the treatment of atrial fibrillation  and Maxigesic® IV  a non-opioid post-operative pain treatment. The Company’s development strategy primarily focuses on the FDA’s 505(b)2 regulatory pathway  which is specifically designed for pharmaceuticals for which safety and efficacy of the molecule have already been established.

VYVGART may increase the risk of infection. In a clinical study  the most common infections were urinary tract and respiratory tract infections. More patients on VYVGART vs placebo had below normal levels for white blood cell counts  lymphocyte counts  and neutrophil counts. The majority of infections and blood side effects were mild to moderate in severity. Your health care provider should check you for infections before starting treatment  during treatment  and after treatment with VYVGART. Tell your health care provider if you have any history of infections. Tell your health care provider right away if you have signs or symptoms of an infection during treatment with VYVGART such as fever  chills  frequent and/or painful urination  cough  pain and blockage of nasal passages/sinus  wheezing  shortness of breath  fatigue  sore throat  excess phlegm  nasal discharge  back pain  and/or chest pain.VYVGART may increase the risk of infection.

Approximately 85% of people with MG progress to gMG within 24 months  where muscles throughout the body may be affected. Patients with confirmed AChR antibodies account for approximately 85% of the total gMG population.About VYVGART® (efgartigimod alfa-fcab)VYVGART is a human IgG1 antibody fragment that binds to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)  resulting in the reduction of circulating immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoantibodies. It is the first and only approved FcRn blocker. VYVGART is approved in the United States and Europe for the treatment of adults with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive and in Japan for the treatment of adults with gMG who do not have sufficient response to steroids or non-steroidal immunosuppressive therapies (ISTs). VYVGART is being studied in adults with primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and other IgG autoantibody-mediated diseases.About argenxargenx is a global immunology company committed to improving the lives of people suffering from severe autoimmune diseases.

Demand remained strong with a steady inflow of orders  particularly in the semiconductor market. These results are in line with our expectations for the year and allow us to confirm our 2023 guidance. We have already started implementing our recently announced 2027 plan  which will see us make significant investments to serve our high-growth markets - mainly semiconductors and electric vehicles - and take Mersen to a new dimension.""Advanced Materials sales amounted to €165 million in the first quarter of 2023  up 17.5% year-on-year on an organic basis. The semiconductor market grew vigorously as expected  driven by rising demand. This led sales in the SiC segment to more than double during the quarter. Momentum was also strong in the aeronautics market  and process industries continued to record double-digit growth.Electrical Power sales reached €137 million for the quarter  an organic rise of 19.2%. This growth was mainly driven by process industries - with electrical distribution booming in the United States - and renewable energies. Electric vehicle sales also rose steadily  while the rail market was less dynamic.In Europe  organic growth was over 16%  led by France and Germany. Sales in renewable energies were fueled by the quickening pace of the energy transition. Aeronautics and SiC semiconductors also experienced robust growth.In Asia  Group sales rose by nearly 6% year on year. Momentum was strong in chemicals and semiconductors but remained sluggish in rail. As expected  solar sales leveled off after a record year in 2022.Lastly  in North America  sales grew by 32% on an organic basis. All activities in the United States contributed to this performance  particularly sales to the electrical distribution market  which benefited in part from a favorable price trend. Momentum was also driven by high business levels in the semiconductor market.Based on its first-quarter performance  the Group is confident that it will achieve its objectives for full-year 2023  namely:organic sales growth of between 5% and 10%;operating margin before non-recurring items of between 10.5% and 11% of sales  taking into account the impact of higher depreciation and amortization expense and the expansion of the electric vehicle teams.Within the framework of its 2027 plan  the Group's capital expenditure is expected to come in between €150 million and €200 million in 2023.Organic growth: Determined by comparing sales for the year with sales for the previous year  restated at the current year's exchange rate  excluding acquisitions and/or disposals.Scope effect: Contribution from companies acquired in the year in relation to sales for the year.Currency effect: Calculated by comparing sales for the previous year at the exchange rate of the previous year with sales for the previous year at the exchange rate of the current year.Financial calendarFirst-half 2023 results: July 27  2023 after the markets close---Mersen is a global expert in electrical specialties and advanced materials for high-tech industries.

As a result  intellectual property protection for masitinib is secured in ALS until 2037.This NOA follows patent protection previously granted in other major international markets  including Europe (patent EP 3240538)  USA (US 10092564)  China (ZL201780019760.9)  South Korea (KR 10-2293847)  Israel (IL 261856)  Australia (AU M53001274)  Eurasia (EA 201800499)  Mexico (MX 390495)  Singapore (SG 11201808106Y)  New Zealand (NZ 745778)  and South Africa (ZA 2018/05810).An NOA is issued after an examiner determines that a patent application satisfies all requirements for patentability. This newly issued patent further enhances the Company's key patent family for masitinib  which includes U.S. patents US7423055B2  US8835435B2  US8993573B2  US8153792B2 and US20100093750A1 (as well as their foreign counterparts).More specifically  this patent provides broad protection of masitinib and related compounds of its class for treatment of ALS in a patient subpopulation initially selected for treatment based on disease aggressiveness (as measured by functional progression rate). This patient population is fully consistent with the clinical development program of masitinib in ALS (study AB10015) including the ongoing international phase 3 randomized clinical trial (AB19001).Masitinib has also received orphan drug designation for ALS from both the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This orphan drug designation provides 10 and 7 years of market exclusivity in Europe and the United States respectively  subsequent to product approval.Alain Moussy  CEO and co-founder of AB Science said  “We continue to strengthen the intellectual property portfolio of our lead compound masitinib and confirm the company’s strategic commitment in developing innovative drugs that target diseases with high unmet medical needs. This new patent provides strong protection for masitinib in the treatment of ALS until 2037 in the key geographic areas where masitinib could be marketed.”About study AB10015Study AB10015 was a randomized  placebo-controlled phase 2/3 clinical trial. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of masitinib at two different doses (4.5 or 3.0 mg/kg/day) when given as an add-on therapy to riluzole during 48 weeks  as compared with placebo given as an add-on therapy to riluzole  in patients with ALS. This study used a prospectively stratified design based on Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale – Revised (ALSFRS-R) progression rate calculated from disease-onset to baseline (ΔFS). A cut-off at 1.1 points/month distinguished between ‘Normal Progressor’ (ΔFS<1.1) and ‘Fast Progressor’ (ΔFS≥1.1) patients. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change in ALSFRS-R from baseline to week 48 between treatment groups in the ‘Normal Progressor’ population.The prespecified primary efficacy analysis on patients receiving masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/day with a ΔFS of less than 1.1 points/month (‘Normal Progressors’) showed a significant benefit over placebo with a between-group difference in ∆ALSFRS-R of 3.4 points (­9.2 vs. ­12.6); p=0.016. This corresponds to a 27% slowing in the rate of functional decline. Sensitivity analyses based on multiple imputation  imputing all data at week 48 for all patients with early discontinuation  and multiple imputation with jump-to-reference  treating early discontinuation in the masitinib group as if receiving placebo from the time of discontinuation  remained significant (∆ALSFRS-R of 3.4 points; p=0.020 and ∆ALSFRS-R of 2.8 points; p=0.039  respectively).A sensitivity analysis was performed in patients with moderate ALS (baseline ALSFRS-R score ≥2 on each individual component of the ALSFRS-R and ΔFS<1.1)  which corresponds to selection of ALS patients early in the course of their disease and is also consistent with newly diagnosed patients. In this cohort  there was a significant 44% reduced risk of death (between group difference in median OS of +25 months  log rank p=0.0478; hazard ratio 0.56 (95%CI [0.32;0.96]  Cox p=0.036) with long-term survival follow-up. The benefit was already apparent at the end the study’s blinded treatment period  with a significant 65% reduced risk of death (hazard ratio 0.35 (95%CI [0.13;0.95]  Cox p=0.039)).About amyotrophic lateral sclerosisAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal motor neuron disorder that is characterized by progressive loss of the upper and lower motor neurons at the spinal or bulbar level. The disease belongs to a group of disorders known as motor neuron diseases  which are characterized by the gradual degeneration and death of motor neurons. In ALS  both the upper motor neurons and the lower motor neurons degenerate or die  and stop sending messages to muscles.The prevalence of ALS in western countries is fairly uniform at 6 per 100 000 persons  corresponding to around 30 000 cases in Europe and 20 000 in the USA.About AB ScienceFounded in 2001  AB Science is a pharmaceutical company specializing in the research  development and commercialization of protein kinase inhibitors (PKIs)  a class of targeted proteins whose action are key in signaling pathways within cells. Our programs target only diseases with high unmet medical needs  often lethal with short term survival or rare or refractory to previous line of treatment.AB Science has developed a proprietary portfolio of molecules and the Company’s lead compound  masitinib  has already been registered for veterinary medicine and is developed in human medicine in oncology  neurological diseases  inflammatory diseases and viral diseases.

Like-for-like (excluding the acquisitions of Eurofun Group in Austria  Extraordinary Journeys in the United States and Pedestria in France)  sales came to €429.4 million  close to the 2019 level even though the first quarter of 2022 was still heavily impacted by the pandemic.As a result  tailor-made travel posted another small decline of 9.3% like-for-like  while adventure travel fell back 18%  on departures  with a strong recovery of sales since April 2022. Following the acquisition of Eurofun Group  European leader in cycling holidays  this business accounted for 12% of total departures in 2022  up from 1% in 2019.After the acquisitions completed in 2022  international sales stood at 32% of the total.RESULTSIn 2022  EBITDA surged to €51.4 million  a 53% increase compared with 2019. Like-for-like  it rose 27% relative to 2019 to reach €42.8 million. The very good performance of margins and compressed external operating expenses have made it possible to significantly improve results  even though the Group has maintained employment in all its structures throughout the period of the pandemic. Net income attributable to owners of the parent moved up 47% compared with 2019 to €29.9 million.The Group held €279.3 million in cash  up 20% relative to the 31 December 2021 level.CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITYAfter two pandemic-affected years  the Group’s payouts returned in 2022 to a level equivalent to that seen in 2019. More than 18% of the wealth created by the business  or €12 million  was paid out as profit-sharing  incentives and bonuses.Concurrently  the Group introduced a working organisation in which any employee who so wishes can work from home for two days a week and regional relocations are prioritised for certain positions.The Group maintained the environmental efforts it began over ten years ago with a two-pronged campaign to use every possible means to reduce the carbon footprint of its business and  secondly  to offset the remainder through reforestation projects. The additional and sustainable credentials of these projects are certified by international bodies  and the projects cover the full amount of carbon emissions arising from travel and the lion’s share of the Group’s operations. In addition  on a like-for-like basis  the 2022 carbon footprint of customers’ travel was almost 30% lower than in 2019. This reflected the combined impact of a reduction in the number of customers and lower intrinsic emissions from the air travel facilities and practices (aircraft  airport infrastructure  etc.). These projects continue to be led by the Insolite Bâtisseur Philippe Roméro corporate foundation.OUTLOOKAs of 2 April 2023  booked departures in 2023 (change stated relative to booked departures in 2019 in the same period) were up 24% like-for-like and 26% including the acquisitions completed in 2022. All the businesses contributed to the increase. Cycling holidays kept up their rapid pace of growth  in line with the trajectory seen in 2022.Barring unforeseen events  the Group’s earnings are expected to post a significant increase owing to the growth in all the businesses  including recently acquired companies.In France  the Group will continue to expand its service offerings across all its brands. Following the acquisition of Eurofun Group  all the adventure brands will introduce a complementary range of cycling holidays.In international markets  the Group continues to consider acquisition opportunities in its core markets.The board of administrators approved the financial statements for 2022 at 4.00 p.m. on 18 April 2023.Reminder:The Group is market leader in France in tailor-made travel (59% of 2022 sales)  with the Voyageurs du Monde  Comptoir des Voyages  Bynativ  Original Travel brands  in adventure travel (29% of 2022 sales)  with the Terres d’Aventure  Allibert Trekking  Nomade Aventure  KE Adventure Travel brands and in cycling holidays (12% of 2022 sales) with the EuroFun Touristik  Loire Valley Travel  Radweg Reisen  SE Tours and Ruckenwind Reisen main brands.The audit procedures have been completed  and the audit report is currently being prepared.The shares are admitted to trading on the Euronext Growth market and eligible for PEA PME savings plans.Contacts:Voyageurs du Monde Lionel Habasque  Deputy CEO  T: +33 (0)1 53 73 77 09,neutral,0.11,0.88,0.0,mixed,0.49,0.21,0.29,True,English,"['Voyageurs du Monde', 'high level', 'earnings growth', 'Business', 'Insolite Bâtisseur Philippe Roméro corporate foundation', 'The Voyageurs du Monde Group', 'Ruckenwind Reisen main brands', 'KE Adventure Travel brands', 'CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY', 'French Regulatory News', 'two pandemic-affected years', 'lower intrinsic emissions', 'air travel facilities', 'Loire Valley Travel', 'Original Travel brands', 'external operating expenses', 'adventure brands', 'Radweg Reisen', 'two days', 'carbon emissions', 'The Group', 'operating subsidies', 'tailor-made travel', 'Press release', 'Consolidated figures', 'Net income', 'Extraordinary Journeys', 'United States', 'first quarter', 'small decline', 'strong recovery', 'European leader', 'cycling holidays', 'good performance', 'working organisation', 'regional relocations', 'environmental efforts', 'two-pronged campaign', 'possible means', 'carbon footprint', 'sustainable credentials', 'international bodies', 'full amount', 'combined impact', 'airport infrastructure', 'rapid pace', 'unforeseen events', 'service offerings', 'complementary range', 'international markets', 'core markets', 'financial statements', 'market leader', 'Comptoir des', 'Allibert Trekking', 'EuroFun Touristik', 'SE Tours', 'audit procedures', 'EQS Group', 'Eurofun Group', 'high level', '31 December 2021 level', 'same period', 'Nomade Aventure', 'significant increase', 'acquisition opportunities', 'reforestation projects', 'international sales', 'BUSINESS ACTIVITY', 'earnings growth', '2022 sales growth', 'total departures', '2019 level', '53% increase', '19:15 CET', 'CEST', 'Dissemination', 'issuer', 'content', 'announcement', 'Paris', 'April', '2019 Change', 'EBITDA', 'owners', 'parent', 'interest', 'taxes', 'depreciation', 'amortisation', 'acquisitions', 'Austria', 'Pedestria', 'France', 'result', 'margins', 'employment', 'structures', 'cash', 'payouts', 'More', 'wealth', 'profit-sharing', 'incentives', 'bonuses', 'employee', 'home', 'positions', 'remainder', 'additional', 'lion', 'share', 'operations', 'basis', 'reduction', 'number', 'customers', 'practices', 'aircraft', 'OUTLOOK', 'businesses', 'trajectory', 'companies', 'board', 'administrators', 'Reminder', 'Voyages', 'Bynativ', 'Terres', '4.00']",2023-04-18,2023-04-19,marketscreener.com

The Resolutions to be proposed at the forthcoming AGM are set out in the Notice of AGM on pages 6 to 8 of this document  with further explanatory notes set out on pages 9 to 11. I would like to draw your particular attention to the following items of business in the Notice of AGM. Election and re-election of Directors In line with Kenmare's commitment to best practice in corporate governance  all of the Directors will retire at the AGM and will offer themselves for election or re-election by the shareholders. A number of important changes to the composition of the Board took place during the year. Steven McTiernan  Tony McCluskey and Sameer Oundhakar stepped down  and I would like to thank them sincerely for their important contributions to Kenmare's success in recent years. As you know  I assumed the role of Chairman following Steven's departure and would like to thank Steven for his advice and support during the transition. I would also like to acknowledge Tony's tremendous contribution to Kenmare. Alongside Michael Carvill  he led the Company from the exploration phase through to mine development and onto expansion and his dedication to the role was unwavering through his tenure. With effect from 26 September 2022  Tom Hickey was co-opted to the Board and appointed as Financial Director. Tom brings significant financial and natural resources experience to Kenmare  having served for 15 years as Executive Director of various public companies  including eight years as Chief Financial Officer of the African and South American-focused oil and gas producer Tullow Oil plc. He has a Bachelor of Commerce degree and a Diploma in Professional Accounting  both from University College Dublin  and he is a Fellow of the Irish Institute of Chartered Accountants. On 25 January 2023  Issa Al Balushi was appointed as a Director  having been nominated by African Acquisition S.à.r.l. (""AAS"") Kenmare's largest investor. Issa is a Manager in Economic Diversification Investments at Oman Investment Authority (""OIA"") (which controls AAS)  has over 10 years of experience in the financial industry and investment and has worked as a portfolio manager for several international and national OIA assets. Issa holds a Master's degree in Financial Analysis from UNSW  Sydney and a Bachelor of Science  Finance from SQU  Muscat. These two most recent appointments have brought enhanced financial and markets experience as well as additional ethnic diversity and wide geographical experience to the Board and we were delighted to welcome them to the Board. The current composition of the Board provides an overall balance of experience  skills and knowledge necessary to create long-term sustainable value for the Company and its stakeholders and would meet the recommendations of the Parker review and the Hampton-Alexander review regarding Board ethnic and gender diversity respectively  were they applicable to the Company. In line with Kenmare's Articles of Association  both Tom and Issa will offer themselves for election at the AGM  and I recommend them for election by shareholders to the Board. 2 Attendance & Voting To facilitate shareholder communication  the AGM will be broadcast by conference call.

This year voting will be done by way of a poll - a written vote - on each of the resolutions put to the meeting. This allows you the opportunity to participate in the decision-making of the Company and have your votes recorded in proportion to the number of shares you hold. Your participation at the AGM is important to the Company  and I would encourage every shareholder to take part in the meeting either by attending the AGM or  if you are not able to attend  by completing and returning a form of proxy or making an electronic proxy appointment. The appointment of a proxy will not prevent a member attending the AGM and voting in person if the member wishes to do so. Recommendation The Board believes that all the proposals set out in the Notice of AGM are in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders as a whole  and unanimously recommends that you vote in favour of the Resolutions  as the Directors intend to do in respect of their own beneficial holdings of shares in the Company. Yours faithfully  Andrew Webb Chairman Directors: Andrew Webb (Chairman)  Issa Al Balushi  Michael Carvill  Mette Dobel  Elaine Dorward-King  Clever Fonseca  Thomas Hickey  Graham Martin  Deirdre Somers. Secretary: Chelita Healy Registered Office: 4th Floor  Styne House  Hatch Street Upper  Dublin 2  D02 DY27  Ireland. Registered No. 37550. Registered in Dublin  Ireland 3 PART II NOTES ON THE RESOLUTIONS Resolution 1: Financial Statements  Directors' Report and Auditor's Report The Directors will present the report and accounts of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2022. A full copy of the Annual Report is available on www.kenmareresources.com. Resolutions 2 and 7: Remuneration Report and Remuneration Policy Shareholders are being asked to consider the Remuneration Committee Report and the Annual Report on Remuneration for the year ended 31 December 2022. The reports are contained in the Annual Report which is available on www.kenmareresources.com. This is an advisory resolution that is not binding on the Company and is being put to shareholders in accordance with section 1110N of the Companies Act 2014. As the Directors' Remuneration Policy was last approved by shareholders at the 2020 AGM  we are also asking shareholders to consider the proposed new Directors' Remuneration Policy as set out in detail on pages 135 to 145 of the 2022 Annual Report. As an Irish incorporated company  the Directors' Remuneration Policy complies with the requirements of the Companies Act 2014 and  on a voluntary basis  with the regulations set out in the UK's Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Report) Regulations 2008 (as amended). In accordance with the Companies Act 2014  the vote on the policy at the Company's forthcoming AGM will be advisory only  and not binding  but if the policy is not approved by that advisory vote  the current policy will continue to apply and the Company will prepare a revised remuneration policy and hold an advisory vote in respect of that revised policy at the following general meeting. The Board will take due notice of shareholder feedback on the policy and it is the Board's intention to operate in line with the approved policy. The Company would seek a further advisory vote from its shareholders should the current policy change or  if earlier  in three years' time. Resolution 3: Dividend The Board is recommending a final dividend of USc43.33 per share on the Ordinary Shares in issue in the capital of the Company in respect of the year ended 31 December 2022. This is in addition to the interim dividend of USc10.98 per share paid in October 2022. Subject to approval by shareholders at the AGM  the final dividend will be paid on 19 May 2023 to shareholders registered on the record date  14 April 2023. Resolution 4: Re-election & Election of Directors In line with Kenmare's commitment to best practice in corporate governance  all of the Directors will retire at the AGM and offer themselves for election or re-election by the shareholders. The performance of the Board is reviewed annually. The recent internal evaluation found that each of the Directors has made a substantial contribution to the leadership and governance of the Company during the year. Details of this internal Board evaluation are set out on page 99 of the 2022 Annual Report. A biography of each of the Directors standing for re-election and election is set out on pages 86 and 87 of the 2022 Annual Report and on our website at www.kenmareresources.com. The Directors' broad range of skills  qualification and experience continue to be important to the Company's long-term sustainable success. Resolution 5: Auditor's Remuneration Resolution 5 authorises the Directors to fix the remuneration of the auditor for the year ending 31 December 2023. Resolution 6: Notice for meetings Resolution 6 is a special resolution and authorises the Directors to call a general meeting on not less than 14 days' notice. This shortened period will not be applicable to an Annual General Meeting or to a meeting convened to pass a special resolution and will expire at the conclusion of the next annual general meeting. As a matter of policy  the 14 day notice period will only be utilised where the Directors believe that it is merited by the business of the meeting and the circumstances surrounding the business. 4 Resolution 8: Allotment of Shares At the annual general meeting of the Company held in 2022  shareholders gave the Directors a general authority under Section 1021 of the Companies Act  2014 to allot shares. That authority will expire at the conclusion of the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. Shareholders are therefore being asked to renew the Directors' authority to allot shares in the Company. Resolution 8 is an ordinary resolution and proposes to authorise the Directors to issue shares up to an aggregate nominal value of €31 609. This represents approximately 33⅓% of the Ordinary Shares in issue (at the latest practicable date before publication of this Circular). This authority will expire at the conclusion of the next annual general meeting of the Company or  if earlier  11 August 2024 (unless previously renewed  varied or revoked by the Company in general meeting). The Directors have currently no intention to issue shares pursuant to this authority except pursuant to awards made under the Kenmare Resources plc Restricted Share Plan 2017 (as amended). There are no treasury shares in issue. Resolution 9 (special resolution): Disapplication of pre-emption rights The power given to the Directors at the 2022 annual general meeting to allot shares for cash otherwise than in accordance with statutory pre-emption rights also expires at the conclusion of the forthcoming AGM. Resolution 9 is a special resolution and empowers the Directors to allot shares and other equity securities in the Company for cash without first offering them to existing shareholders in proportion to their holdings. This power is limited to shares having an aggregate nominal value equal to the nominal value of 5% of the issued ordinary share capital as at the close of business on the date of the AGM and will expire at the conclusion of the next annual general meeting of the Company after the passing of this resolution or  if earlier  11 August 2024 (unless previously renewed  varied or revoked by the Company in general meeting). The Pre-emption Group's Statement of Principles  as updated in November 2022  supports the annual disapplication of pre-emption rights in respect of issues of shares and other equity securities for cash up to an aggregate of 10% of the issued ordinary capital. The Directors currently have no intention to allot such shares at the present time and will exercise this power only if they consider this to be in the best interests of shareholders generally at that time. Resolution 10 (special resolution): Authority to make market purchases of the Company's own shares At the annual general meeting of the Company held in 2022  shareholders gave the Directors a general authority to make market purchases (as defined in section 1072 of the Companies Act 2014). That authority will expire at the conclusion of the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. Shareholders are therefore being asked to renew this authority. Resolution 10 is a special resolution and proposes to renew the Company's authority to make market purchases of up to 10% of its own shares. The authority would only be exercised if market conditions make it advantageous to do so and if the Directors were to consider that such purchases would be in the best interests of shareholders. The authority being sought under this resolution would permit any shares so purchased either to be cancelled or held as treasury shares. The authority  if given  will not oblige any shareholder to sell his or her shares in the Company. Resolution 10 sets out the minimum and maximum prices which may be paid. There were outstanding  at the latest practicable date prior to publishing this Circular  options to subscribe for 2 660 015 Ordinary Shares  representing approximately 2.81% of the Company's issued share capital at that date. If the repurchase authority were to be exercised in full  the shares subject to these options would represent approximately 3.12% of the Company's issued share capital. Resolution 11 (special resolution): Authority to reissue Ordinary Shares The approval of the price range at which the Company may re-issue treasury shares also expires at the conclusion of the forthcoming Annual General Meeting. Resolution 11 is a special resolution and proposes to approve the price range at which any treasury share (that is  a share of the Company purchased and held by the Company rather than being cancelled) may be reissued other than on Euronext Dublin. The maximum and minimum prices at which such a share may be reissued are  generally  120% and 95%  respectively  of the average market price of a share calculated over the five business days immediately preceding the date of such reissue. As at the date of this notice  the Company held no Ordinary Shares as treasury shares. 5 This is an excerpt of the original content. To continue reading it  access the original document here.

The US regulatory body had requested this additional data while considering market approval for Maxigesic® IV  a novel  dual mode-of-action non-opioid pain treatment delivered through intravenous (IV) infusion.The submission of an additional Extractable & Leachable data set follows a Complete Response Letter received in July 2022 regarding the assessment of the primary packaging  in essence the vial and the vial’s stopper in which the drug product is stored. Importantly  the FDA did not report any issues related to the data generated during the clinical development program.The formal response to the Complete Response Letter was filed with the FDA on 17 April 2023. Assuming a positive assessment by the FDA  this implies potential registration of Maxigesic® IV for the US market before year end.Sales could follow soon after  with an exclusive license and distribution agreement already signed between AFT and Hikma Pharmaceuticals (“Hikma”). Hikma is a leading supplier of complex  injectable hospital products in the U.S.Under the terms of the development collaboration agreement between Hyloris and AFT  Hyloris is eligible to receive a share on any product-related revenues  such as license fees  royalties  milestone payments  received by AFT.Stijn Van Rompay  Chief Executive Officer of Hyloris  commented: “We are excited to unlock the potential of Maxigesic® IV to improve patients’ lives in the biggest health care market in the world. We expect the data we have submitted will satisfy the FDA’s requirements.”“In the United States  new persistent opioid use can be considered one of the most common complications after elective surgery  occurring in 5.9% to 6.5% of cases1. This societal problem impacts many American lives in a tragic way. There is an urgent need for safer and more effective non-opioid pain treatments in a hospital setting to avoid triggering addiction in patients. Maxigesic® IV holds the promise of becoming a valuable pain treatment option without the side effects and risk of addiction associated with opioids.”About Maxigesic® IVMaxigesic® IV is a novel  dual mode-of-action  non-opioid pain treatment for use post-operatively in hospitals or when patients cannot take medicine orally. It is a unique combination of 1000mg paracetamol with 300mg ibuprofen solution for infusion  thereby reducing both pain and inflammation.Results from a randomized  placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial demonstrated that Maxigesic® IV was well-tolerated and had a faster onset of action  offered higher pain relief  and provided the potential to reduce the use of opioids compared to ibuprofen IV or paracetamol IV alone in the same doses. Further exposure studies have demonstrated the drug’s efficacy and safety in an expanded population group over a longer treatment period. Maxigesic® IV is protected by several granted and pending patent applications.About Hyloris PharmaceuticalsHyloris is a specialty biopharma company focused on innovating  reinventing  and optimizing existing medications to address important healthcare needs and deliver relevant improvements for patients  healthcare professionals and payors.

Approximately 85% of people with MG progress to gMG within 24 months  where muscles throughout the body may be affected. Patients with confirmed AChR antibodies account for approximately 85% of the total gMG population.About VYVGART® (efgartigimod alfa-fcab)VYVGART is a human IgG1 antibody fragment that binds to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)  resulting in the reduction of circulating immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoantibodies. It is the first and only approved FcRn blocker. VYVGART is approved in the United States and Europe for the treatment of adults with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive and in Japan for the treatment of adults with gMG who do not have sufficient response to steroids or non-steroidal immunosuppressive therapies (ISTs). VYVGART is being studied in adults with primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and other IgG autoantibody-mediated diseases.About argenxargenx is a global immunology company committed to improving the lives of people suffering from severe autoimmune diseases.

This data has been published in peer-reviewed international journals in 2022 and 2023. As a result  BioSenic has developed a patent for its ATO combines with copper discoveries and potential applications  particularly in the fields of cancer and autoimmunity.This specific new key patent issued by the EPO continues BioSenic’s Group intellectual portfolio strategy involving further patent applications in other regions. These patents will accompany the implementation by BioSenic of international clinical trials in pathologies with clear unmet medical needs. These clinical trials will support BioSenic’s aim of generating clinical data to support further market access approvals.“BioSenic's new EPO patent  which has been granted for the 27 European countries  opens new avenues for the treatment of diseases with clinical unmet medical need in the field of immunity. This patent involves two main areas of application. The first is in innate  adaptive and trained immunity  and the second is in oncology  where arsenic trioxide has already demonstrated results for patients with acute promyelocytic leukaemia. These diseases affect a significant percentage of the world's population  and autoimmune diseases in particular lead to chronic illnesses with  all too often  severe prognostics ” said François Rieger  PhD  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of BioSenic. “By achieving further understanding of the multiple effects of arsenic combined with copper and associating this with a new intellectual property of BioSenic  we will now be able to advance innovative treatments to meet the needs of many patients with challenging diseases that lack medical support.”The results recently generated by BioSenic and published in two scientifically renowned peer-reviewed international journals demonstrate the benefits of using a combination of arsenic trioxide and copper salts in preclinical models of autoimmune diseases. These diseases include chronic graft versus host disease (Frontiers in Immunology  2022)  and systemic sclerosis (Frontiers in Medicine  2023). These results provide data to support the potential of this combination therapy will be translate by BioSenic into clinical trials.The expected availability of an oral formulation that combines arsenic and copper puts BioSenic in a unique position to build on clinical successes in lupus and Graft versus Host Disease therapy. As a result  BioSenic will be able to continue clinical development with proprietary formulation containing less arsenic and that minimizes secondary side effects.About BioSenicBioSenic is a leading biotech company specializing in the development of clinical assets issued from: (i)  the allogeneic cell therapy platform ALLOB and (ii) the Arsenic TriOxide (ATO) platform. Key target indications for the platforms include Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD)  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) and high-risk tibial fractures.Following the merger in October 2022  BioSenic combines the strategic positionings and strengths of Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics. The merger also enables Biosenic to add to its innovative cell therapy platform and strong IP for tissue repair protection with an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/OATO.BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About BioSenic technology platformsBioSenic’s technology is based on two main platforms:1) The allogeneic cell and gene therapy platform  developed by BioSenic with differentiated bone marrow sourced Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) that can be stored at the point of use in hospitals. Its current investigational medicinal product  ALLOB  represents a unique  proprietary approach to organ repair and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells on the site of injury after a single local injection. These cells are produced via a BioSenic's scalable manufacturing process. Following the CTA approval by regulatory authorities in Europe  BioSenic has initiated patient recruitment for the Phase IIb clinical trial with ALLOB in patients with difficult tibial fractures  using its optimized production process. ALLOB is currently being evaluated in a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase IIb study in patients with high-risk tibial fractures  using its optimized production process  after a successful first safety and efficacy study (Phase 1/2a) on fractured long bones  with late delayed union. The patient recruitment has been halted late February 2023 with 57 patients and the new rules permitted for statistical analysis should allow BioSenic to get the main results of this trial much earlier than anticipated in the original protocol  since they are expected by mid-2023.2) The Arsenic TriOxide (ATO) platform developed by Medsenic. The immunomodulatory properties of ATO have demonstrated a double basic effect on cells of the immune system. The first effect is the increase of the cell oxidative stress in activated B  T or other cells of the innate/adaptative immune system to the point they will enter a cell death program (apoptosis) and be eliminated. The second effect is potent immunomodulatory properties on several pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in inflammatory or autoimmune cell pathways. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. GvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). GvHD is primarily mediated by the transplanted immune system that can lead to severe multiorgan damage. Medsenic had been successful in a Phase II trial with its intravenous formulation  allowing arsenic trioxide to be granted an orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA and is heading towards an international Phase III confirmatory study  with a new  IP protected  oral (OATO) formulation. Moderate to Severe forms of Systemic Lupus erythematosus (SLE) is another selected target  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastro-intestinal tract) in a Phase IIa study.Systemic Sclerosis is  in addition  part of the clinical pipeline of BioSenic. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive. This gives good grounds to launch a Phase II clinical protocol for this serious disease that badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and with no actual current effective treatment.In addition  BioSenic is developing an off-the-shelf next-generation improved viscosupplement  JTA-004  consisting of a unique combination of plasma proteins  hyaluronic acid - a natural component of knee synovial fluid  and a fast-acting analgesic. JTA-004 intends to provide added lubrication and protection to the cartilage of the arthritic joint and to alleviate osteoarthritic pain (OA) and inflammation. In March 2023  after the identification of new OA subtypes  BioSenic delivered a new post-hoc analysis of its Phase III JTA-004 trial on knee OA with positive action on the most severely affected patient population. This new post-hoc analysis changes the therapeutic profile of the molecule and potentially allows for the possibility of stratifying patients for a new  optimized Phase III clinical study. BioSenic  which does not intend to allocate R&D resources to support the clinical development of JTA-004 and will continue to focus its R&D activities on the development of its autoimmune (ATO) and cell therapy (ALLOB) platforms  is now seeking to collaborate with existing and potential partners to explore options for the future development of JTA-004 based on this new post-hoc analysis.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAPr.

This data has been published in peer-reviewed international journals in 2022 and 2023. As a result  BioSenic has developed a patent for its ATO combines with copper discoveries and potential applications  particularly in the fields of cancer and autoimmunity.This specific new key patent issued by the EPO continues BioSenic’s Group intellectual portfolio strategy involving further patent applications in other regions. These patents will accompany the implementation by BioSenic of international clinical trials in pathologies with clear unmet medical needs. These clinical trials will support BioSenic’s aim of generating clinical data to support further market access approvals.“BioSenic's new EPO patent  which has been granted for the 27 European countries  opens new avenues for the treatment of diseases with clinical unmet medical need in the field of immunity. This patent involves two main areas of application. The first is in innate  adaptive and trained immunity  and the second is in oncology  where arsenic trioxide has already demonstrated results for patients with acute promyelocytic leukaemia. These diseases affect a significant percentage of the world's population  and autoimmune diseases in particular lead to chronic illnesses with  all too often  severe prognostics ” said François Rieger  PhD  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of BioSenic. “By achieving further understanding of the multiple effects of arsenic combined with copper and associating this with a new intellectual property of BioSenic  we will now be able to advance innovative treatments to meet the needs of many patients with challenging diseases that lack medical support.”The results recently generated by BioSenic and published in two scientifically renowned peer-reviewed international journals demonstrate the benefits of using a combination of arsenic trioxide and copper salts in preclinical models of autoimmune diseases. These diseases include chronic graft versus host disease (Frontiers in Immunology  2022)  and systemic sclerosis (Frontiers in Medicine  2023). These results provide data to support the potential of this combination therapy will be translate by BioSenic into clinical trials.The expected availability of an oral formulation that combines arsenic and copper puts BioSenic in a unique position to build on clinical successes in lupus and Graft versus Host Disease therapy. As a result  BioSenic will be able to continue clinical development with proprietary formulation containing less arsenic and that minimizes secondary side effects.About BioSenicBioSenic is a leading biotech company specializing in the development of clinical assets issued from: (i)  the allogeneic cell therapy platform ALLOB and (ii) the Arsenic TriOxide (ATO) platform. Key target indications for the platforms include Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD)  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) and high-risk tibial fractures.Following the merger in October 2022  BioSenic combines the strategic positionings and strengths of Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics. The merger also enables Biosenic to add to its innovative cell therapy platform and strong IP for tissue repair protection with an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/OATO.BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About BioSenic technology platformsBioSenic’s technology is based on two main platforms:1) The allogeneic cell and gene therapy platform  developed by BioSenic with differentiated bone marrow sourced Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) that can be stored at the point of use in hospitals. Its current investigational medicinal product  ALLOB  represents a unique  proprietary approach to organ repair and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells on the site of injury after a single local injection. These cells are produced via a BioSenic's scalable manufacturing process. Following the CTA approval by regulatory authorities in Europe  BioSenic has initiated patient recruitment for the Phase IIb clinical trial with ALLOB in patients with difficult tibial fractures  using its optimized production process. ALLOB is currently being evaluated in a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase IIb study in patients with high-risk tibial fractures  using its optimized production process  after a successful first safety and efficacy study (Phase 1/2a) on fractured long bones  with late delayed union. The patient recruitment has been halted late February 2023 with 57 patients and the new rules permitted for statistical analysis should allow BioSenic to get the main results of this trial much earlier than anticipated in the original protocol  since they are expected by mid-2023.2) The Arsenic TriOxide (ATO) platform developed by Medsenic. The immunomodulatory properties of ATO have demonstrated a double basic effect on cells of the immune system. The first effect is the increase of the cell oxidative stress in activated B  T or other cells of the innate/adaptative immune system to the point they will enter a cell death program (apoptosis) and be eliminated. The second effect is potent immunomodulatory properties on several pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in inflammatory or autoimmune cell pathways. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. GvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). GvHD is primarily mediated by the transplanted immune system that can lead to severe multiorgan damage. Medsenic had been successful in a Phase II trial with its intravenous formulation  allowing arsenic trioxide to be granted an orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA and is heading towards an international Phase III confirmatory study  with a new  IP protected  oral (OATO) formulation. Moderate to Severe forms of Systemic Lupus erythematosus (SLE) is another selected target  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastro-intestinal tract) in a Phase IIa study.Systemic Sclerosis is  in addition  part of the clinical pipeline of BioSenic. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive. This gives good grounds to launch a Phase II clinical protocol for this serious disease that badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and with no actual current effective treatment.In addition  BioSenic is developing an off-the-shelf next-generation improved viscosupplement  JTA-004  consisting of a unique combination of plasma proteins  hyaluronic acid - a natural component of knee synovial fluid  and a fast-acting analgesic.

We were able to complete the Phase 2-3 COVA clinical trial and report positive results from the study demonstrating the effect of Sarconeos (BIO101) in the treatment of severe forms of COVID-19. The statistically significant 44% reduction in the risk of respiratory failure or early death is a very important result for patients as COVID-19 continues to be a major health problem  with over 40 000 deaths in 2022 according to Santé Publique France. Confident in the therapeutic potential of Sarconeos (BIO101)  we have pursued the implementation of an EAP  with the objective of providing access to Sarconeos (BIO101) to a few thousand COVID-19 patients hospitalised in Brazil and France in the second half of 2023. In parallel  we are preparing for the filing of a conditional marketing authorisation (CMA) in Europe and an emergency use authorisation (EUA) in the US.The end of the clinical development phase and the start of the regulatory process of this COVA project in COVID-19 means that our financing needs are decreasing. We are now entering a new era  with the opportunity to generate the first revenues from our research investment as early as the second half of 2023. In parallel  we will continue to carry on the company's other projects (sarcopenia - SARA  Duchenne muscular dystrophy - MYODA and AMD - MACA) while remaining frugal with our financial and human resources. In a global context that remains very challenging for biotech companies  we will continue to be highly adaptive to pursue the development of our pipeline of drug candidates with very limited resources  without losing sight of our main objective which is to obtain conditional marketing approvals for Sarconeos (BIO101) in the treatment of Covid-19 and to generate our first revenues in the early access program as early as 2023.""Page 1 of 5Major operational milestones achieved in 2022:The company focused its human and financial resources on completing the COVA phase 2-3 study in COVID-19  reporting its results and preparing an early access programme for Sarconeos (BIO101)· As regards to our global Phase 2-3 COVA study in COVID-19ü Enrolment of the study stopped in April 2022 after the 237th patient had been enrolled; ü Discharge of the last COVA patient in June 2022  locking of the clinical database and analysis of results in August 2022; ü Reporting of promising first trial results in September 2022; ü Reporting of the positive post-hoc analysis of the phase 2-3 COVA study strongly supporting the therapeutic potential of Sarconeos (BIO101) in severe forms of COVID-19 in November 2022; ü Publication of positive final study results in February 2023 demonstrating that the clinical study met the primary endpoint with a 44% reduction in the risk of early death and respiratory failure.· As regards to the preparation of the early access program for Sarconeos (BIO101) for the treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patientsü Obtaining early access approval in February 2022 for critical COVID-19 patients in Brazil; ü Preparing the industrialization of Sarconeos (BIO101) in view of the early access program in Brazil and France.· Scientific communication in international congresses of the main results of the SARA (Sarcopenia) and MYODA (Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy) programs.ü SARA: Presentation of the main clinical results of phase 2 SARA-INT at the ICFSR in Boston  USA  in April 2022 and of the possible design of phase 3 at the SCWD in Lisbon  Portugal  in June 2022 ü MYODA: Presentation of new preclinical efficacy data for Sarconeos (BIO101) in SMA (Spinal Muscular Atrophy) at the SMA Cure 2022 conference in Anaheim  California  U.S.2023 outlook and perspectives:· For the COVA study in COVID-19:The Company has initiated the regulatory development process with a view to marketing Sarconeos (BIO101) in severe forms of COVID-19.To accelerate the availability of this treatment  an early access program has been initiated in France and Brazil. In France  a pre-filing meeting with the French Health Authority was held in March and the Company plans to file this application in the second quarter of 2023  with the objective of starting this program in the second half of this year. In Brazil  the Company continues to re-initiate the early access program  which was suspended at the end of the COVA clinical trial in mid-2022  pending final efficacy and safety results. These programs should enable the treatment of a few thousand COVID-19 patients in hospital and thus generate the first revenues for the company from 2023 on.In parallel  the Company is preparing the conditional marketing authorizatioń application in Europe and due to the health emergency in the United States that we expect to submit in 2023  depending on the feedback from regulatory agencies. In addition  the Company has started the industrialization of the production of Sarconeos (BIO101) in order to complete the regulatory file for the marketing authorization application and with a view to commercialization in 2024.Page 2 of 5For the SARA study in Sarcopenia:Following the first Type C meeting with the FDA in January 2022  a scientific advice meeting was held with the EMA to discuss the Phase 3 protocol  targeting a similar population and endpoints as the Phase 2 study. We have continued to engage with the FDA and EMA throughout 2022 and have defined the protocol for the Phase 3 study. We now plan to seek approval to initiate a Phase 3 clinical trial in Europe and the US from the relevant regulatory authorities (EMA and FDA) in the second quarter of 2023. We are also actively seeking industrial partners interested in co-developing Sarconeos (BIO101) in this indication.For the MYODA study in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD):Following the receipt of an ""Authorization to Proceed"" (IND - Investigational New Drug) letter from the FDA (USA) in December 2019  Biophytis received authorization from the Belgian FAMHP in March 2021 to continue its Sarconeos (BIO101) clinical study in non-ambulatory patients with DMD. However  due to the COVID-19 crisis and its impact on our operational capabilities  the MYODA study was postponed. We have thoroughly revised the protocol and propose a phase 1/2 study for non-ambulatory DMD patients with signs of deteriorating lung function. We expect to submit this new protocol to the competent authorities in the second half of 2023.Annual 2022 Financial ResultsThe Company's annual 2022 non-audited consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS were reviewed by the Company's Board of Directors on April 14  2023. Audit procedures are being completed  the issuance of the audit report is pending  and will be included in the Company's upcoming 2022 annual financial report and SEC Form 20-F  respectively to be filed with AMF and SEC.• Cash and cash equivalents and short-term deposits included in other current financial assets. Cash and cash equivalents and short-term deposits included in other current financial assets as of December 31  2022 were €11.1 million  a significant decrease of €12.8 million compared to €23.9 million as of December 31  2021.The table below summarizes the key figures of financial statements.31/12/2021 12 months 31/12/2022 (Amounts in thousands of euros  except for stock data) (as restated) (1) 12 months Revenues - - Cost of sales - - Gross margin - - Research and development costs  net (19 665 ) (16 034 ) General and administrative costs (7 150 ) (7 237 ) Operating profit (26 815 ) (23 272 ) Financial result (2 517 ) (2 564 ) Tax income (expense) 24 983 Change in fair value of derivative liability (1 856 ) 637 Financial Results (4 349 ) (944 ) Results before tax (31 164 ) (24 216 ) Tax income - - Net results (loss) (31 164 ) (24 216 ) To Biophytis' shareholdersNon controlling interests (31 163 ) (24 216 ) (1 ) - Weighted average number of outstanding shares (not including own shares) 118 282 679 174 839 276 Earning per share (€/share) (0.26 ) (0.14 ) Diluted earning per share (€/share) (0.26 ) (0.14 )Page 3 of 5• Research and Development Expenses. Net research and development expenses were €16.0 million for 2022  a decrease of €3.6 million  compared to €19.7 million in 2021. This decrease is mainly reflecting the end of the Phase 2-3 clinical trial of the COVA program  as well as the end of the SARA-INT study in 2021. Net research and development expenses included research tax credits (French 'Crédit d'Impôt Recherche'  or CIR) totaling €3.3 million in 2022 compared to €4.0 million in 2021. Net R&D costs represent 69% of operating expenses in 2022  compared to 73% in 2021.• General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses were €7.2 million for 2022 compared to €7.2 million for 2021  a very slight increase between the two years.•Financial results: Financial loss amounted to €1.0 million in 2022 vs €4.4 million in 2021  a decrease of €3.4 million as of 31 December 2021. Resulting majorly from the variation of the fair value as calculated using IFRS 9  for our various convertible financing instruments  respectively Atlas and Kreos.• Net Loss. Net loss was €24.2 million for 2022  as compared to €31.2 million for 2021. Net loss per share (based on weighted-average number of shares outstanding over the period except the treasury shares) was €0.14 in 2022 compared to €0.26 in 2021.(1) In October 2022  it was determined that the annual consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31  2021 required correction for the accounting treatment of the financing agreement with Kréos  as per IFRS 9.

General   The remuneration policy for the...https://www.marketscreener…,"KENDRION N.V. REMUNERATION POLICY EXECUTIVE BOARD ADOPTED AGM 17 APRIL 2023 Page 1 of 9EXECUTIVE BOARD REMUNERATION POLICY 1. General The remuneration policy for the members of the Executive Board of Kendrion N.V. (""Kendrion"") has been developed by the Supervisory Board and proposed for adoption to the general meeting of shareholders (the ""General Meeting"") in April 2023. Upon adoption by the General Meeting in April 2023 this remuneration policy becomes applicable to (i) remuneration granted in the years 2024 up to and including 2027 - irrespective whether pay-outs and vesting of performance shares become due  occur or are made after 2027; and (ii) remuneration of Executive Board members reappointed by the General Meeting in 2023 as of the date on which the new term of office of such reappointed Executive Board member commences. The Executive Board remuneration policy is evaluated at least once every four years by the Supervisory Board. The HR Committee of the Supervisory Board will continue to keep the Supervisory Board informed of relevant market and legislative developments in order to support the periodic evaluation of the remuneration policy and related decision-making. 2. Objectives The remuneration policy serves to recruit and retain diverse  qualified  and experienced executives to deliver Kendrion's sustainable long-term value creation strategy. In addition  the remuneration policy aims to maintain an adequate link between pay and performance and appropriately align the interests of the members of the Executive Board with the interests of shareholders - and the interests of other stakeholders - and focus on the sustainable delivery of high performance over the long-term by stimulating share ownership whilst adhering to the applicable standards of good corporate governance. Taking account of Kendrion's size (in terms of revenues  average market capitalisation  total assets  and number of FTE)  its industrial market position  geographical scope and labour market competition  the companies included in the AScX Index on Euronext Amsterdam are defined as relevant reference group. Financial services  real estate and movies and entertainment companies are excluded from the reference group. Within the defined reference group  Kendrion is positioned around the median in terms of the average of the abovementioned parameters revenues  average market capitalisation  total assets  and number of FTE. The remuneration structure and level for the Executive Board is set around the median level relative to the reference group. The remuneration policy does not contain variable incentives that may be detrimental to the responsibilities of the Executive Board in defining and achieving Kendrion's sustainable long-term value creation strategy. 3. Temporary deviations remuneration policy In exceptional circumstances  the Supervisory Board can decide to temporarily deviate from the remuneration policy for members of the Executive Board. Exceptional circumstances mean circumstances in which a deviation is considered necessary to serve the long-term interests and sustainability of Kendrion or to otherwise ensure its viability. Depending on the exceptional circumstances  the Supervisory Board can resolve to deviate from any or all of the four remuneration components included in the remuneration policy for members of the Executive Board. When considering a temporary deviation from the remuneration policy  the Supervisory Board shall consider Kendrion's sustainable long-term value creation strategy  ongoing business and operational requirements as well as the financial situation of Kendrion. In addition  the temporary deviation considered should be assessed in light of the principles of reasonableness and fairness. Page 2 of 9Upon having resolved a temporary deviation from the remuneration policy  the Supervisory Board will (i) cancel and withdraw all temporary deviations from the remuneration policy prior to the first annual General Meeting following the effective date of the deviation; or (ii) propose the necessary amendments to the remuneration policy for adoption during the first annual General Meeting following the effective date of the deviation. Deviations from the remuneration policy will be reported in Kendrion's remuneration report. 4. Remuneration components The remuneration policy for the members of the Executive Board consists of four components: a fixed base salary  a short-term variable remuneration  a long-term variable remuneration and other benefits such as a pension scheme and a car allowance or lease budget. The sum of the fixed base salary  the short-term variable remuneration and the long-term variable remuneration for members of the Executive Board are considered appropriate in relation to: (i) the identity  the purpose  and values of Kendrion  (ii) the pay-ratios within Kendrion  (iii) the (international) context in which Kendrion operates and (iv) reasonable views of relevant stakeholder groups. The variable remuneration components are subject to a maximum value determined in advance in accordance with the remuneration policy. The Supervisory Board will carry out scenario analyses to assess that the pay-out level of variable remuneration components appropriately reflect performance. 5. Fixed base salary Members of the Executive Board receive a fixed base salary  the amount of which is set around the median level relative to the relevant reference group referred to above in paragraph 2 (Objective) of this remuneration policy. The fixed base salary levels can be adjusted to be decided upon by the Supervisory Board  based on general market movement and inflation figures. In addition to the above  any increase of the annual fixed base salary up to and around the prevailing median level relative to the relevant reference group referred to above in paragraph 2 (Objective)  can be decided upon by the Supervisory Board and will not be regarded as an amendment to the remuneration policy. 6. Short-term variable remuneration The short-term variable remuneration is payable in cash  the amount of which is based on the achievement of predetermined  specific  and measurable financial and non-financial driven performance criteria. CEO The short-term variable remuneration ranges from 0% to 90% of the annual fixed gross base salary of the CEO  with 60% being the target amount CFO The short-term variable remuneration ranges from 0% to 67.5% of the annual fixed gross base salary of the CFO  with 45% being the target amount 6.a Performance criteria The performance criteria for the short-term variable remuneration are based on Kendrion's strategic intent to continuously grow revenue and profitability in a sustainable way  with a lean and focused organisation  and to provide a safe and high-quality work environment to its employees. Supportive to Kendrion's strategic intent  the performance criteria for the short-term variable remuneration include financial and non-financial criteria. Page 3 of 9The financially driven performance criteria determine 60% of the short-term variable remuneration and reflect the financial priorities of Kendrion. The remaining 40% of the short-term variable remuneration is determined by non-financially driven performance criteria and reflect sustainability/ESG ambitions and other priorities directly linked to Kendrion's strategic intent. 6.b Financial performance criteria Each year the Supervisory Board selects at least three financial driven performance criteria from the list below with a view to incentivise delivery of financial priorities that support Kendrion's strategic and operational spearheads. The Supervisory Board may allocate different weight percentages to the different financial performance criteria it selects for a particular year  provided a minimum weight of 10% shall apply to a financial performance criterion. Financial performance criteria1 Net profit Return on sales (ROS) Return on investment (ROI) Organic growth Free cash flow Revenue EBITA EBITDA The performance incentive zone (threshold  target and maximum) for each financial performance criterion will be determined in advance by the Supervisory Board by reference to the strategic and operational spearheads for the respective performance year. No pay-out will be made for below threshold performance. 6.c Non-financial performance criteria Each year the Supervisory Board selects a certain number of non-financial performance criteria derived from the strategic and operational spearheads for the respective performance year  which will in any event include performance criteria in the area of sustainability/ESG (i.e. environmental  social and/or governance criteria). Achievement of each individual non-financial performance criterion will be measured by applying binary scoring model. The amount of the pay-out for the achievement of non-financial performance criteria depends on the number of non-performance criteria achieved. A predefined step curve will be applied to calculate the pay-out between the achievement of the minimum threshold number of selected non-financial performance criteria and achievement of all selected non-financial performance criteria. No pay-out will be made for below threshold performance. 6.d Investment of part of the short-term remuneration earned Members of the Executive Board must invest at least 20% of the net amount of the pay-out of the short-term remuneration earned until the required ownership level has been reached as prescribed under the 'Share ownership guideline' described in paragraph 8 of this remuneration policy. 1 In each case excluding items that are generated outside the ordinary course of business and the amortization of intangibles arising on acquisitions or similar corporate events.

Despite significant swings during the month  equity markets shrugged off these concerns and finished March higher with the Euro Stoxx 50® Total Return up +1.95% and the S&P500® Total Return up +3.67%  albeit with significant disparity in sector performance within indices.The market implied volatility measure VStoxx® was flat across the month at 19.4% despite a jump up during the middle of the month. Credit markets followed equities with a more constructive tone and tightened slightly over the month with the iTraxx Crossover® (S38) moving from 414bps to 406bps at the end of March.In this context  the BG Fund (USD A) was down -220bps in March overall. Credit special situations made a positive contribution in line with the growing opportunity set along with volatility trading  while equity and convertibles underperformed as a consequence of the sharp rate move and lagging hedges. Trading strategies were the main detractor primarily due to the significant market shift caused by this sharp fall in US rates.Important InformationThe Company is established as a closed-ended investment company domiciled in Guernsey.
