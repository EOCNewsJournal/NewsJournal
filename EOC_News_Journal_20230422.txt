The guidelines are applicable on agreements entered into after the annual general meeting held on 24 May 2023  and as far as changes are made to existing agreements  thereafter.Remuneration Policy for Maha Energy AB (publ)IntroductionPurposeThis remuneration policy encompass the Company’s Executive Management. The guidelines do not include remuneration decided by the general meeting. The board of directors may temporarily resolve to deviate from the guidelines  in whole or in part  if in a specific case there is special cause for the deviation and a deviation is necessary to serve the Company’s long-term interests  including its sustainability  or to ensure the Company’s financial viability. If such deviation occurs  this shall be disclosed for the next annual general meeting. Terms of employments governed by rules other than Swedish may be duly adjusted to comply with mandatory rules or established local practice  taking into account  to the extent possible  the overall purpose of these guidelines.Principles  promotion of the Company’s business strategy  long-term interests and sustainabilityThe board of directors assesses that the successful implementation of the Company’s business strategy and safeguarding of its long-term interests  including its sustainability  builds on the Company being able to recruit and retain highly qualified and capable management to achieve set goals. In order to achieve this  the Company must be able to offer competitive total remuneration which these guidelines enable.Remuneration shall not discriminate on grounds of gender  ethnic background  national origin  age  disability or other irrelevant factors.Types of remuneration etc.The main principle is that remuneration and other employment conditions for members of the Executive Management shall be based on market terms and be competitive in order to ensure that the group can attract and retain competent members of the Executive Management at a reasonable cost for the Company. The total remuneration to the Executive Management may consist of fixed cash remuneration  variable cash remuneration  pension benefits and other benefits. Additionally  the general meeting may – irrespective of these guidelines – resolve on  among other things  share or share price-related remuneration.Fixed cash remunerationEach member of the Executive Management shall be offered a fixed remuneration to be paid in cash and on market terms commensurate with the international oil and gas sector  based on responsibilities  sector and time experience and performances. The fixed remuneration shall be adjusted annually. In order to avoid that the Executive Management is encouraged to take inappropriate risks  there shall be a fundamental balance between fixed and variable remuneration. The fixed remuneration shall thus be large enough in relation to the total remuneration paid to the Executive Management in order to render it possible to reduce the variable remuneration to zero.Variable cash remunerationIn addition to the fixed remuneration  the members of the group’s Executive Management may be offered variable remuneration to be paid in cash  as follows:(i) Regular Variable Cash Remuneration: based on the result in relation to performance goals within the respective area of responsibility and in line with the shareholders’ interests. Regular Variable Cash Remuneration shall be tied to annual performance related objectives and shall amount to a maximum of 100 percent of the gross fixed remuneration.Regular Variable Cash Remuneration shall be based on clear  predetermined and measurable criteria and predefined individual and operational goals  which can be financial  such as budget control  or non-financial  such as non-productive time measurements or production volume related goals. By setting criteria for Regular Variable Cash Remuneration for the Executive Management linked to the Company’s earnings as well as sustainability  the Company’s business strategy  long-term interests and competitiveness are promoted. The fulfillment of these criteria shall be measured over a period of one year  and shall be determined based on the Company’s performance and the criteria agreed with the individual member of the Executive Management.(ii) Extraordinary Variable Cash Remuneration: further variable cash remuneration may be awarded in extraordinary circumstances  provided that such extraordinary arrangements are limited in time and only made on an individual basis  either for the purpose of recruiting or retaining executive management  or as remuneration for extraordinary performance beyond the individual’s ordinary tasks and/or as a premium for the performance of such individual on relevant events or transactions involving the Company. Such remuneration may be paid on different extraordinary events per year  but may not in total exceed an amount corresponding to 50 percent of the gross fixed annual cash remuneration.The Company’s remuneration committee shall propose and evaluate goals for variable remuneration for the group’s Executive Management (i) each year in case of Regular Variable Cash Remuneration  or (ii) when required based on the applicable circumstances  in case of Extraordinary Variable Cash Remuneration. The evaluation made by the remuneration committee shall be reported to the board of directors.Should variable remuneration paid have been based on information that later shows to have been evidently incorrect  the Company shall have the possibility to request repayment. Variable remuneration shall not be pension qualifying. Extraordinary variable cash remuneration may be compensated/offset with the regular variable cash remuneration  upon the sole discretion of the Board Members/CEO (as the case may be).Long-term share or share-price related incentive programmesLong-term share-related incentive programmes in the form of warrants giving right to subscribe for new shares have been implemented in the Company. Such programmes have been resolved by the general meeting and are therefore excluded from these guidelines. Warrants entitling the holder to subscribe for new shares in the Company have been issued and allocated to participants under four different incentive programmes for employees and senior management in the Company and its subsidiaries. The first incentive programme was adopted at the annual general meeting held on 27 May 2020  the second and third was adopted at the annual general meeting held on 27 May 2021  and the fourth was adopted at the annual general meeting held on 31 May 2022. The warrants issued under the four incentive programmes entitle the holder to subscribe for shares in the Company from 1 June 2023 until and including 29 February 2024  from 1 June 2023 until and including 29 February 2024  from 1 June 2024 until and including 28 February 2025  and from 1 June 2025 until and including 1 June 2030  respectively. Allocation in the programmes is depending on salary level and time of employment and maximum allocation is conditional upon continued employment during a vesting period of two to three years.The share related incentive programs are designed to retain and attract long term qualified and committed personnel in a global oil and gas market setting. The program is available to select employees and has historically re-occurred annually. The board of directors has proposed that the annual general meeting 2023 resolves on an incentive program to employees and consultants to be implemented during a period of three years. The remuneration committee and the board of directors shall continuously evaluate whether to propose share related incentive programs at the annual general meeting.PensionPension benefits  including health insurance  shall be premium defined unless the individual concerned is subject to defined benefit pension under mandatory collective bargaining agreement provisions. The pension premiums for premium defined pension shall amount to not more than 10 percent of the gross pension qualifying income.The Company will  at the minimum  follow statutory requirements for pension contributions in each applicable jurisdiction it operates.Other benefitsOther benefits may include  inter alia  life insurance  health insurance and medical benefits  and shall be limited in value in relation to other remuneration and shall be paid only in so far as it is considered to be in accordance with the market for other members of executive managements holding corresponding positions on the employment market where the member in question is operating. Premiums and other costs relating to such benefits may amount to not more than 15 percent of the gross fixed remuneration.Termination and severance paymentThe notice period for termination given by the Company shall be no longer than six months for all members of the Executive Management  with a right to redundancy payment after the expiration of the notice period corresponding to not more than 100 percent of the gross fixed cash remuneration for a maximum of 12 months  meaning that the fixed remuneration and redundancy payment shall together not exceed 18 months’ gross fixed salary. Any right to redundancy payment shall decrease in situations where remuneration is received from another company. In any case  observed the aforementioned limitation  the notice period and the amount of the redundancy payment shall be defined  on a case by case basis  taking into consideration (i) the requirements of law applicable to the contract entered with the member of the Executive Management  (ii) the common practice of the location where such contract was entered  and (iii) the period that the member of Executive Management has been employed/ contracted by the Company prior to the notice of termination.Upon notice given by a member of the Executive Management  the notice period shall generally be six months for the CEO and three months for other members of the Executive Management. In the event a member of the Executive Management terminates his or her employment  no severance shall be payable.Consideration given to existing salaries and employment conditions for employeesIn the preparation of the board of directors’ proposal for these remuneration guidelines  salary and employment conditions for employees of the Company have been taken into account by including information on the employees’ total income  the components of the remuneration and increase and growth rate over time  in the board of directors’ basis of decision when evaluating whether the guidelines and the limitations set out herein are reasonable.The decision-making process to determine  review and implement the guidelinesThe board of directors has established a remuneration committee. The committee’s tasks include preparing the board of directors’ decision to propose guidelines for Executive remuneration. The board of directors shall prepare a proposal for new guidelines when there is need for significant changes and at least every fourth year  and submit it to the general meeting. The guidelines shall be in force until new guidelines are adopted by the general meeting. The committee shall also monitor and evaluate programs for variable remuneration for the Executive Management  the application of the guidelines for Executive remuneration as well as the current remuneration structures and compensation levels in the Company. The members of the committee are independent of the Company and its Executive Management. The CEO and other members of the Executive Management do not participate in the board of directors’ processing of and resolutions regarding remuneration-related matters in so far as they are affected by such matters.Information in regard to previously decided remunerationExcept for recurring commitments  there are no remuneration commitments in relation to members of the Executive Management that have not become due.Description of material changes to the remuneration policy and explanation of how the shareholders’ opinions have been taken into accountThese guidelines are decided by the annual general meeting. The board of directors has  following the election of new board members on 3 November 2022 and 29 March 2023  assessed the need for changes and deemed the proposed changes to be necessary to successful implement the Company’s business strategy and safeguard its long-term interests  including its sustainability  and to be able to recruit and retain highly qualified and capable management. Pursuant to the proposed new remuneration policy the maximum yearly Extraordinary Variable Cash Remuneration may be paid on different extraordinary events per year provided that the maximum yearly amount is not exceeded. The proposed new remuneration policy is deemed to increase flexibility inter alia in recruiting and retaining executive management as well as deciding on remuneration for extraordinary performance beyond the individual’s ordinary tasks and/or as a premium for the performance of such individual on relevant events or transactions involving the Company. Within the proposed new policy the possible annual other benefits have increased from 10 percent to 15 percent of the gross fixed remuneration due to the Company’s potential costs for such benefits. The board of directors has not received any comments from shareholders.Item 15. Resolution on an incentive program and issuance of warrants to employees and consultants (LTIP 8)The board of directors in Maha Energy AB (publ) (the “Company”) proposes that the general meeting resolves on an incentive programme for the Executive Management and other employees and consultants of the Company and its subsidiaries (together  the “Group”) through issuance of warrants entitling to subscription of new shares in the Company as set forth below.BackgroundThe proposal to launch an incentive programme by the issuance of warrants is presented by the board of directors of the Company in order to strengthen the retention of Executive Management and other employees and consultants with the Group and to motivate these to create shareholder value. The board of directors assess that these objectives are in line with all shareholders’ interests.The programme encompasses current and future employees and consultants of the Group. Board members are not allowed to participate. Those entitled to participate in the incentive programme are hereinafter referred to as “Participants”.The programme will be implemented through transfer of warrants to Participants during a period of three years.Terms and conditions for the issue of warrantsThe Company shall issue not more than 4 612 345 warrants. Each warrant entitles to subscription of one (1) new share  each with a quotient value of SEK 0.011. The warrants may  with deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights  only be subscribed for by Maha Energy Inc (the “Subsidiary”)  a subsidiary of the Company  after which the Subsidiary is to transfer the warrants to the Participants in accordance with the resolution adopted by the general meeting and instructions from the board of directors of the Company. Subscription of warrants shall be made by the Subsidiary on a subscription list following the general meeting’s issue resolution  but no later than 31 May 2023. The board of directors of the Company shall be entitled to prolong the subscription period. The warrants shall be issued without consideration (i.e. free of charge) to the Subsidiary. If all issued warrants are subscribed for by the Subsidiary  transferred to and exercised by the Participants for subscription of new shares  the Company’s share capital will increase with SEK 50 735.795 (subject to potential recalculations in accordance with standard terms and conditions applicable to the warrants). The warrants may be exercised for subscription of new shares during the period as from registration of the warrants with the Swedish Companies Registration Office until and including 1 January 2030. Warrants that have not been exercised for subscription of new shares by 1 January 2030 shall lapse. Each warrant shall entitle the warrant holder to subscribe for one (1) new share in the Company at a subscription price per share (the “Exercise Price”) of SEK 8.50. Any amount that exceeds the quotient value shall be transferred to the nonrestricted share premium account. The Exercise Price may never be below the quotient value of the shares. The warrants are subject to customary recalculation conditions.Allocation principles to be applied in relation to ParticipantsWarrants subscribed for by the Subsidiary shall be transferred to the Participants in accordance with instructions from the board of directors of the Company and the principles set forth below. Any resolution to transfer warrants to the Participants shall be made by the board of directors.The transfers of warrants from the Subsidiary to the Participants are to be made without consideration (i.e. free of charge).Warrants are granted under the incentive programme to employees of the Group  and are intended to align such individual’s and shareholder interests by attempting to create a direct relation between compensation and shareholder return. Participation in the incentive programme rewards overall corporate performance  as measured through the price of the shares in the Company. In addition  the incentive programme enables employees to develop and maintain a significant ownership position in the Company. No Participant may be offered more than 2 306 173 warrants.Allocated warrants may be exercised for subscription of new shares in the Company during the period as from registration of the warrants with the Swedish Companies Registration Office until and including 1 January 2030. Subscription of new shares may however not take place during so-called closed periods according to the EU Market Abuse Regulation  or otherwise in breach of relevant insider rules and regulations (including the Company’s internal guidelines in this respect).Warrant agreementAll warrants will be governed by warrant agreements to be entered into between each Participant and the Subsidiary in connection with the transfer of warrants from the Subsidiary. The warrant agreement will include a so-called vesting structure  certain transfer restrictions and other terms and conditions customary for such agreements. The period from allocation of warrants until a share may be acquired may not be less than three years and the warrants shall vest in tranches of one third (1/3) of the allocated warrants per year during a total vesting period of three years. Exception may be made from the period until a share may be acquired and the vesting period in certain situations  such as (i) where the Participant’s employment or assignment as consultant is terminated or (ii) otherwise where exceptional circumstances exist as determined by the board of directors to allow flexibility for the Company in such situations. Such exceptions shall be included in the specific warrant agreements entered into with the Participants.Reasons for the deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rightsThe reasons for the deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights is that the Company wishes to offer warrants to employees of the Group in order to strengthen the retention of employees and to motivate them to contribute to the creation of shareholder value.Dilution  costs  etc.Upon full subscription  transfer and exercise of all 4 612 345 issued warrants; a total of 4 612 345 new shares will be issued in the Company (subject to potential recalculations in accordance with standard terms and conditions applicable to the warrants). This would lead to a dilution corresponding to approx. 3 percent of the total share capital and number of votes in the Company (based on the share capital and number of shares in the Company as of the date of this proposal and calculated as the maximum amount of share capital and number of shares that may be issued  divided by the total share capital and the total number of shares in the Company after the proposed warrants to be issued have been exercised).The incentive programme is expected to have a marginal effect on the Company's earnings per share. The market value is preliminary estimated to SEK 5.22 per warrant  based on a market value of the underlying share corresponding to SEK 9.73 and the Exercise Price of SEK 8.50 per share.Costs related to the issuance of warrants under the incentive programme will be accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2 and recognized as an expense in the income statement during the vesting period. The preliminary estimate of total cost to be recorded during the term of the programme is SEK 24 075 519.

Pursuant to the Oatly Incentive Plan  an extraordinary general meeting held on 6 May 2021 resolved to implement a long-term group-wide incentive program for members of the group management  key employees and other employees in the Company and within the Oatly group  as well as consultants who work full-time for the Oatly group and over a longer period (""LTIP 2021-2026""). LTIP 2021-2026 currently comprises a total maximum of 28 936 359 RSUs and 39 170 223 stock options  of which a total of 9 069 498 RSUs and 15 443 383 stock options granted to participants are outstanding or have vested as of the date of this proposal. In connection with the implementation of LTIP 2021-2026  the Company issued a total of 68 106 582 warrants (Sw. teckningsoptioner) for purposes of securing delivery of shares  warrants or American depository shares in the Company (""ADS"") upon exercise of RSUs and stock options granted in LTIP 2021-2026. Based on the number of RSUs and stock options outstanding or vested as of the date of this resolution proposal  43 593 701 of the warrants issued in connection with the implementation of LTIP 2021-2026 remain to be used for hedging purposes. In addition  the Company may  pursuant to the Oatly Incentive Plan  also apply any warrants that become available if any award granted under the Oatly Incentive Plan expires  lapses or is terminated. Such warrants that are or may become available as hedging instruments for future grants under the Oatly Incentive Plan are in this resolution referred to as ""Treasury Warrants"". The board of directors of Oatly now proposes that the general meeting resolves on an amendment of LTIP 2021-2026 entailing certain changes to allocation principles and certain terms and conditions relating to vesting of stock options and RSUs granted under LTIP 2021-2026. The proposed changes in allocation principles aim to enable grants to a greater number of participants and to achieve appropriate and proportional annual allocations over the duration of LTIP 2021-2026 by establishing allocation limits calculated on an annual basis. The proposed changes in vesting terms and conditions aim to reduce administration and costs  as well as to facilitate grants in connection with new hires  by aligning the vesting schedule with the annual vesting period generally applied by Oatly. The proposal on an amendment of LTIP 2021-2026 has been put forward as the remuneration committee and the board of directors determines that such amendment is of importance and in the best interests of Oatly and its shareholders for purposes of enabling the Company to attract and retain critical talent for current and future members of the executive management team  top key personnel  selected senior key personnel  selected mid-level personnel and other personnel. In view of the above  the board of directors proposes that the general meeting resolves on an amendment of LTIP 2021-2026 and on approval of transfer of Treasury Warrants in accordance with items (a) and (b) below. The resolutions under items (a) and (b) are proposed to be conditional upon each other and for that reason it is proposed that both resolutions are passed as one resolution. The terms and conditions of this resolution to amend LTIP 2021-2026 shall replace the terms and conditions of the resolution approved by the extraordinary general meeting held 6 May 2021 and shall apply to grants made after the date of this resolution. In the event this resolution is not passed  the current terms and conditions of LTIP 2021-2026 will remain in force in accordance with the resolution passed by the extraordinary general meeting held on 6 May 2021. (a) - Proposal on amendment of LTIP 2021-2026 The board of directors proposes that the general meeting resolves to amend LTIP 2021-2026. LTIP 2021-2026 was implemented  and is amended  under and pursuant to the Oatly Incentive Plan. Please refer to the section Terms and conditions of the Oatly Incentive Plan below. Following the amendment  LTIP 2021-2026 is proposed to include grants of stock options and RSUs (together  ""Awards"") to current and future members of the executive management team  top key personnel  selected senior key personnel  selected mid-level personnel and other personnel.

Allocation principles  etc. General The participants' right to be granted stock options and RSUs following the general meetings' resolution have been differentiated with reference to position  responsibility and working performance in the Oatly group. The participants have for this reason been divided into the below five (5) categories  which may each comprise current and future employees or long-term consultants of the Oatly group. The right to be granted stock options or RSUs out of LTIP 2021-2026 shall be reserved for participants in Categories A  B  C  D and E. Stock options and RSUs may be granted on one (1) or more occasions during each financial year  but grants may not be made to a greater number of participants per Category and financial year than the maximum number set out below: Category A: CEO (not more than one (1) participant per financial year) Category B: Other members of the executive management team and top key personnel (not more than 25 participants per financial year) Category C: Selected senior key personnel (not more than 975 participants per financial year) Category D: Selected mid-level key personnel (not more than 999 participants per financial year) Category E: Other personnel (not more than 2 000 participants per financial year) The below allocation principles shall apply to the grant of stock options and RSUs within  respectively  Categories A  B  C  D and E. The maximum numbers listed below shall apply for each financial year irrespective of whether grants are made on one or more occasions and the board of directors shall not be prevented from allocating less Awards than the maximum numbers set out in the tables below. The board of directors intend to apply the allocation principles with an aim to achieve an appropriate allocation size on an annual basis. The size of annual allocations may vary depending on  among other things  individual seniority  total compensation mix  personnel changes and fluctuations in the market price of the Company's ADSs. Further  the total number of Awards granted may never exceed the number of Treasury Warrants available to secure the settlement of Awards. Thus  the number of Awards available to be granted during individual years for the duration of LTIP 2021-2026 may vary depending on the outcome of such factors. The development of such factors may entail that the number of Treasury Warrants available for grants during later years of LTIP 2021-2026 are insufficient to achieve a proportional annual allocation. Maximum allocation per participant and year within each Category The below table outlines the maximum number of each type of Awards that may be allocated per participant and year within each Category. The column All Awards indicates the total maximum number of Awards that may be allocated to any participant within each Category per year  irrespective of how the number is distributed among the types of Awards. Stock options Maximum number per participant and year RSUsMaximum number per participant and year All AwardsTotal maximum number of Awards per participant and year Category A: 1 687 500 675 000 2 362 500 Category B: 1 376 570 346 618 1 723 188 Category C: 612 500 118 750 731 250 Category D: N/A 5 000 5 000 Category E: N/A 2 500 2 500 Maximum allocation within each Category The below table outlines the total maximum number of each type of Award that may be allocated within each Category per year.

Stock options Maximum number within the Category per year RSUsMaximum number within the Category per year All AwardsTotal maximum number of Awards per Category and year Category A: 1 687 500 675 000 2 362 500 Category B: 5 793 501 3 930 098 9 723 599 Category C: 3 100 625 4 266 259 7 366 884 Category D: N/A 2 747 250 2 747 250 Category E: N/A 3 000 000 3 000 000 Adjustments for additional available Treasury Warrants The numbers of Awards available to be granted within each Category per year are based on the total of approximately 43.6 million Treasury Warrants available as hedging instruments for future grants as of the date of this resolution proposal  and the number of years remaining of LTIP 2021-2026. If additional Treasury Warrants become available for grants  inter alia due to the expiration  lapsing or termination of grants made prior to or following this resolution proposal  or due to the maximum number of Awards not having been allocated during any year  such additional available Treasury Warrants shall be applied to increase the number of stock options and RSUs available to be granted during the remaining years of LTIP 2021-2026 in accordance with the following principles: The number of additional Treasury Warrants having become available as hedging instruments during the previous year shall be divided by the number of years remaining up to and including 2026  and the quotient shall then increase the maximum number of stock options and RSUs available to be granted in Categories A  B  C  D and E in proportion to the maximum number of Awards in each Category as stated in the table above. (a) The maximum number of participants per year in each Category and the maximum number of Awards per participant in each category may not be exceeded. (b) Non-allocated Awards In the event all stock options or RSUs within Categories A  B  C  D and E are not granted  such non-granted stock options and RSUs may be offered to participants in another category with less stock options and/or RSUs available for allotment during the relevant financial year. The maximum number of stock options and/or RSUs per participant within each category as set out above may however not be exceeded for any individual. Settlement The board of directors shall be entitled to decide that participants may  instead of delivery of Treasury Warrants  ADSs or shares in the Company  be offered cash settlement upon exercise of stock options or RSUs granted under LTIP 2021-2026 in accordance with the provisions of the Oatly Incentive Plan. (b) - Proposal on approval of transfer of Treasury Warrants Oatly retains  and will in the future retain  the Treasury Warrants (43 593 701 Treasury Warrants are retained as of the date of this resolution proposal). Each Treasury Warrant gives a right to subscribe for one (1) share in the Company at a price equal to the quota value of the Company's share (currently SEK 0.0015) before or on 31 December 2040. The board of directors proposes that the general meeting approves that transfers of Treasury Warrants  shares or ADSs resulting from the exercise of the Treasury Warrants (jointly the ""Treasury Instruments"") may occur on the following terms and conditions: The right to acquire Treasury Instruments shall be granted to participants covered by the terms and conditions of LTIP 2021-2026 (as amended). Transfers may be made against no consideration  against consideration corresponding to the quota value of shares in the Company or against consideration in another amount  in each case pursuant to the terms of Awards granted under LTIP 2021-2026. (i) Treasury Instruments may be transferred to third parties engaged or established for settlement of exercises of Awards within LTIP 2021-2026 and ancillary services  or otherwise sold or disposed of  for purposes of securing delivery of shares or ADSs or otherwise settling exercises of Awards under LTIP 2021-2026. Treasury Instruments may be transferred to and by such third parties against no consideration  against consideration corresponding to the quota value of shares in the Company or against consideration in another amount. (ii) Treasury Instruments may be transferred during such periods as may be necessary or appropriate for purposes of securing delivery of shares or ADSs or otherwise settling exercises of Awards under LTIP 2021-2026. (iii) The number of ADSs in the Company that may be transferred under LTIP 2021-2026 may be subject to recalculation in the event of a split  reverse split  etc. pursuant to the terms of the Oatly Incentive Plan. (iv) For the avoidance of doubt  the approval of transfers of Treasury Instruments under this Item 16(b) shall not be deemed to limit  restrict or prevent any assignment  transfer or other disposal of warrants in the Company approved by the extraordinary general meeting held on 6 May 2021 with respect to grants of RSUs or stock options made prior to the approval of this resolution proposal  and transfer of such warrants may also occur on the terms and conditions of this Item 16(b). - Resolution regarding (a) amendment of resolution on issue of share awards to certain members of the board of directors of Oatly Group AB (publ) and (b) approval of transfer of treasury warrants issued in connection with the share award program Background and reason Oatly Group AB (publ) (the ""Company"" or ""Oatly"") has in 2021 adopted an incentive award plan (the ""Oatly Incentive Plan"") under which the Company may  subject to approval by the shareholders at a general meeting  issue different types of awards  including stock options  restricted stock units and other incentive awards. Pursuant to the Oatly Incentive Plan  an extraordinary general meeting held on 6 May 2021 resolved to implement an incentive program for members of the board of directors who are not employed by the Oatly group  or by Verlinvest  China Resources  Blackstone or Östersjöstiftelsen  under the Oatly Incentive Plan (the ""Board LTIP""). In order to secure delivery of shares under the Board LTIP  the general meeting resolved on issue and approval of transfer of 1 389 933 warrants of series 2021-B  each exercisable into one share in the Company. Equity-based awards are a central part of an attractive and competitive remuneration package in order to attract  retain and motivate internationally competent members of the board of directors  and to focus the participants on delivering exceptional performance which contributes to value creation for all shareholders. Granting equity-based awards to certain members of the board of directors will increase and strengthen the participants' dedication to Oatly's operations  improve company loyalty and be beneficial to both the shareholders and Oatly. In the light of the above  the Remuneration Committee has identified a need to adjust the allocation principles set forth in the Board LTIP in order to achieve a competitive allocation of share awards (""Share Awards"") under the Board LTIP. In order to achieve competitive individual allocations based on the current market value of the Company's ADS  the maximum number of Share Awards that may be granted to each participant is proposed to be increased from 10 800 to 35 000 Share Awards annually. However  the limitation on the total value of Share Awards that may be granted to each participant will remain unchanged at USD 140 000 annually. It is therefore proposed that the general meeting resolves to approve an amendment of the Board LTIP and the transfer of warrants of series 2021-B in accordance with items (a) and (b) below. The resolutions under items (a) and (b) are proposed to be conditional upon each other and for that reason it is proposed that both resolutions are passed as one resolution. The terms and conditions of this resolution to amend the Board LTIP shall replace the terms and conditions of the resolution approved by the extraordinary general meeting held 6 May 2021 and shall apply to awards made after the date of this resolution. In the event this resolution is not passed  the current terms and conditions of LTIP 2021-2026 will remain in force in accordance with the resolution passed by the extraordinary general meeting held on 6 May 2021. (a) - Proposal on amendment of the Board LTIP It is proposed that the general meeting resolves to amend the Board LTIP. The Board LTIP was implemented  and is amended  under and pursuant to the Oatly Incentive Plan. Please refer to the section Terms and conditions of the Oatly Incentive Plan below. In addition to the 76 140 Share Awards granted to members of the board of directors under the Board LTIP which have vested or remain outstanding as of the date of this resolution proposal  1 313 793 Share Awards remain to be granted following the amendment proposed under this resolution proposal. Below is a description of the main terms and conditions for the Share Awards following the amendment pursuant to this resolution proposal. The Share Awards shall be granted to members of the board of directors who are not employed by the Oatly group  or by Verlinvest  China Resources  Blackstone or Östersjöstiftelsen. Each participant may each year be granted a number of Share Awards equivalent to USD 140 000  as determined by the closing price of the Company's ADS on Nasdaq Global Select Market on the last trading day immediately preceding the date of grant of the Share Award  provided however that in no event shall a participant be awarded more than 35 000 Share Awards per year  and the total number of Share Awards awarded to all participants  excluding Share Awards that have lapsed  been terminated or forfeited  shall in no event exceed 1 389 933. The Share Awards shall be granted free of charge to the participants no later than 31 December 2026. The Share Awards shall vest on the date of the next annual general meeting after the date of grant  provided that the participant is still a board member of Oatly on such date. Each vested Share Award entitles the holder to receive one share  warrant of series 2021-B or ADS in the Company without any compensation being payable (or at a price equal to the quota value of the Company's shares)  provided that the holder is still a board member of Oatly at the relevant time of vesting. The Share Awards may not be transferred or pledged. The number of shares  warrants of series 2021-B or ADSs in the Company that each Share Award entitles to subscription for will be adjusted in the event of a split  reverse split  etc. in accordance with customary re-calculation terms. (b) - Proposal transfer of warrants of series 2021-B In order to fulfill the commitments arising from the Share Awards  it is proposed that the general meeting authorizes that the Company may assign the warrants of series 2021-B to a third party  or in another way dispose of the warrants of series 2021-B  in accordance with the above. - Resolution on authorization for the board of directors to resolve on new issue of shares and/or warrants and/or convertible bonds The board of directors proposes that the AGM resolves to authorize the board of directors  on one or more occasions during the period until the next AGM  to resolve on new issue of shares and/or warrants and/or convertible bonds. Such issues should not entail an increase in the company's registered share capital or the number of shares in the company by more than a total of 20 percent  based on the company's registered share capital or number of shares before utilizing the authorization. The new issue of shares and/or warrants and/or convertible bonds may be performed with or without deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights. The board of directors' resolution may provide for payment in kind  payment against set-off and/or other terms. The purpose of the authorization is to increase Oatly's financial flexibility. If the board of directors resolves on an issue with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  the reason shall be to provide the company with new capital and/or new shareholders of strategic importance for the company. The reason may also be to deliver shares in accordance with the terms and conditions announced in connection with an earlier issue of convertible bonds. When deviating from the shareholders' preferential rights  the basis for the subscription price shall be on market terms. Majority requirements Approval of the proposals according to item 16 and 17 requires that the AGM's resolutions are supported by shareholders representing at least nine tenths of the votes cast and shares represented at the AGM. Approval of the board of directors' proposal according to item 18 requires that the AGM's resolution is supported by shareholders representing at least two thirds of the votes cast and shares represented at the AGM. Documents Documents that shall be made available prior to the general meeting pursuant to the Swedish Companies Act will be made available at Oatly  Ångfärjekajen 8  Malmö  and on Oatly's website at https://investors.oatly.com/corporate-governance/2023agm no later than from and including 4 May 2023. The documents will be sent to shareholders who so request and provide their postal address. Shareholders' right to receive information The board of directors and the CEO shall  if any shareholder so requests and the board of directors believes that it can be done without material harm to Oatly  provide information regarding circumstances that may affect the assessment of an item on the agenda and Oatly's relation to other companies within the Group.

The reason for deviating from the shareholders' pre-emption rights is to enable the Company to raise working capital  to carry out company acquisitions or acquisitions of operating assets and to enable issue to industrial partners within the framework of collaborations and alliances. The number of shares that can be issued with the support of authorization shall be limited in such a way that the number of shares after a fully subscribed new issue does not increase by more than 20 percent of the shares outstanding at the time of this notice. To the extent that a new issue takes place with deviation from the shareholders' pre-emption rights  the new issue shall take place on market terms.The Board's proposal to adopt a long-term incentive program for management and other employees in the Company (item 15)The Board of Directors proposes that the AGM resolves to issue not more than 700 000 warrants of series 2023/2026 within the scope of a long-term incentive program for management and other employees within Safeture as follows.In total  the incentive program will comprise not more than 5 management personnel and not more than 26 other employees in Safeture. In addition  future employees can be invited to acquire warrants. The incentive program entails that Safeture's employees are offered to acquire warrants at market value calculated according to the Black-Scholes valuation formula.Each warrant shall entitle the holder to subscribe for one new share in the Company at an exercise price corresponding to 150 percent of the volume weighted average price of the Company's share during a period of ten trading days immediately preceding the offer to acquire warrants  however  not less than the quota value of the Company's share. The number of shares that each warrant entitles to  as well as the exercise price  will be recalculated should the Company resolve on a share split  consolidation of shares  issue  etc. in accordance with customary recalculation conditions. The full terms and conditions for the warrants shall apply in all other aspects  as set out in the Board's complete proposal.Each warrant entitles the holder to subscribe for one new share in Safeture during the period from and including 8 June 2026 to and including 26 June 2026.The price per warrant shall be determined by an independent valuation institute as appointed by the Company and correspond to the market value of the warrant at the time of the acquisition  calculated in accordance with the Black-Scholes valuation formula. Based on a share price of SEK 4.66 per share  the market value of the warrants has been preliminarily calculated to SEK 0.98 per warrant.The last day for acquisition of warrants shall be the day prior to the AGM 2024. If acquisitions cannot take place before this date due to the participant having access to insider information  acquisitions must be made as soon as practicably possible after the information has ceased to be considered as insider information. The same principle applies during so-called ""closed periods"" according to the EU Market Abuse Regulation.To be entitled to participate in the incentive program  the participant must have entered into an advance purchase agreement with Safeture  whereby Safeture  with certain exceptions  reserves the right to repurchase warrants if the participant's employment or assignment in Safeture ends or if the participant in turn wishes to transfer the warrants before the warrants can be exercised.Allocation of warrantsThe right to subscribe for warrants shall accrue to the Company's CEO  no more than 5 other management personnel and no more than 26 other employees in Safeture. In addition  future employees can be invited to acquire warrants. The Company's CEO (category 1) shall be offered to acquire 200 000 warrants  every other management personnel who is offered to participate in the incentive program (category 2) shall be offered to acquire 50 000 warrants and every other employee who is offered to participate in the incentive program (category 3) shall be offered to acquire 10 000 warrants. If warrants within a certain category remain after all notifications within the category have been satisfied (i.e.  in the case of so-called ""undersubscription"")  the remaining number of warrants can be allocated to participants in the same or another category  whereby the Board of Directors shall decide the distribution based on the number of warrants notified for each person who wishes additional allocation. However  such allocation may at most entail that the maximum number of warrants per person within a certain category is exceeded by 100 percent. In the event of oversubscription  the number of warrants shall be reduced pro rata for the participants (regardless of category) based on how many warrants each participant has registered to subscribe for. A prerequisite for the offer shall be that the person concerned has entered into a pre-emption agreement with the Company. The Board of Directors shall have the right to decide on the detailed allocation in accordance with the above principles.Costs and dilutionThe warrants will be transferred at market value  which means that no social security contributions are to be paid by Safeture due to the acquisition of the warrants.Based on the number of shares in Safeture per day of the notice to the AGM  the maximum dilution effect of the warrant program will be approximately 1.76 percent. Taking into account the shares that can be issued in accordance with previously implemented incentive programs in the Company  as well as the incentive program proposed by the Nomination Committee to Board members of Safeture  the maximum dilution amounts to approximately 4.43 percent.The incentive program is only expected to have a marginal effect on the Company's key ratios.The rationale for the incentive programThe Board of Directors considers that a share-related incentive program is an important part of a competitive remuneration package to attract and motivate management and employees  as well as maximize value for all shareholders. The Board of Directors further considers that the warrant program will increase the participants' involvement in the Company's operations  strengthen the loyalty to the Company and be in favor of both the Company and its shareholders.Preparation of the proposalThe incentive program has been prepared by the Board of Directors in consultation with external advisors. The proposal has been reviewed at meetings of the Board of Directors during the spring of 2023.For a description of the Company's other long-term incentive programs  please visit Safeture's website  www.safeture.com.Majority requirementsResolution in accordance with item 14 above require approval of at least two thirds (2/3) of the shares represented and votes cast at the AGM.

The guidelines are applicable on agreements entered into after the annual general meeting held on 24 May 2023  and as far as changes are made to existing agreements  thereafter. Remuneration Policy for Maha Energy AB (publ) Introduction Purpose This remuneration policy encompass the Company’s Executive Management. The guidelines do not include remuneration decided by the general meeting. The board of directors may temporarily resolve to deviate from the guidelines  in whole or in part  if in a specific case there is special cause for the deviation and a deviation is necessary to serve the Company’s long-term interests  including its sustainability  or to ensure the Company’s financial viability. If such deviation occurs  this shall be disclosed for the next annual general meeting. Terms of employments governed by rules other than Swedish may be duly adjusted to comply with mandatory rules or established local practice  taking into account  to the extent possible  the overall purpose of these guidelines. Principles  promotion of the Company’s business strategy  long-term interests and sustainability The board of directors assesses that the successful implementation of the Company’s business strategy and safeguarding of its long-term interests  including its sustainability  builds on the Company being able to recruit and retain highly qualified and capable management to achieve set goals. In order to achieve this  the Company must be able to offer competitive total remuneration which these guidelines enable. Remuneration shall not discriminate on grounds of gender  ethnic background  national origin  age  disability or other irrelevant factors. Types of remuneration etc. The main principle is that remuneration and other employment conditions for members of the Executive Management shall be based on market terms and be competitive in order to ensure that the group can attract and retain competent members of the Executive Management at a reasonable cost for the Company. The total remuneration to the Executive Management may consist of fixed cash remuneration  variable cash remuneration  pension benefits and other benefits. Additionally  the general meeting may – irrespective of these guidelines – resolve on  among other things  share or share price-related remuneration. Fixed cash remuneration Each member of the Executive Management shall be offered a fixed remuneration to be paid in cash and on market terms commensurate with the international oil and gas sector  based on responsibilities  sector and time experience and performances. The fixed remuneration shall be adjusted annually. In order to avoid that the Executive Management is encouraged to take inappropriate risks  there shall be a fundamental balance between fixed and variable remuneration. The fixed remuneration shall thus be large enough in relation to the total remuneration paid to the Executive Management in order to render it possible to reduce the variable remuneration to zero. Variable cash remuneration In addition to the fixed remuneration  the members of the group’s Executive Management may be offered variable remuneration to be paid in cash  as follows: (i) Regular Variable Cash Remuneration: based on the result in relation to performance goals within the respective area of responsibility and in line with the shareholders’ interests. Regular Variable Cash Remuneration shall be tied to annual performance related objectives and shall amount to a maximum of 100 percent of the gross fixed remuneration. Regular Variable Cash Remuneration shall be based on clear  predetermined and measurable criteria and predefined individual and operational goals  which can be financial  such as budget control  or non-financial  such as non-productive time measurements or production volume related goals. By setting criteria for Regular Variable Cash Remuneration for the Executive Management linked to the Company’s earnings as well as sustainability  the Company’s business strategy  long-term interests and competitiveness are promoted. The fulfillment of these criteria shall be measured over a period of one year  and shall be determined based on the Company’s performance and the criteria agreed with the individual member of the Executive Management. (ii) Extraordinary Variable Cash Remuneration: further variable cash remuneration may be awarded in extraordinary circumstances  provided that such extraordinary arrangements are limited in time and only made on an individual basis  either for the purpose of recruiting or retaining executive management  or as remuneration for extraordinary performance beyond the individual’s ordinary tasks and/or as a premium for the performance of such individual on relevant events or transactions involving the Company. Such remuneration may be paid on different extraordinary events per year  but may not in total exceed an amount corresponding to 50 percent of the gross fixed annual cash remuneration. The Company’s remuneration committee shall propose and evaluate goals for variable remuneration for the group’s Executive Management (i) each year in case of Regular Variable Cash Remuneration  or (ii) when required based on the applicable circumstances  in case of Extraordinary Variable Cash Remuneration. The evaluation made by the remuneration committee shall be reported to the board of directors. Should variable remuneration paid have been based on information that later shows to have been evidently incorrect  the Company shall have the possibility to request repayment. Variable remuneration shall not be pension qualifying. Extraordinary variable cash remuneration may be compensated/offset with the regular variable cash remuneration  upon the sole discretion of the Board Members/CEO (as the case may be). Long-term share or share-price related incentive programmes Long-term share-related incentive programmes in the form of warrants giving right to subscribe for new shares have been implemented in the Company. Such programmes have been resolved by the general meeting and are therefore excluded from these guidelines. Warrants entitling the holder to subscribe for new shares in the Company have been issued and allocated to participants under four different incentive programmes for employees and senior management in the Company and its subsidiaries. The first incentive programme was adopted at the annual general meeting held on 27 May 2020  the second and third was adopted at the annual general meeting held on 27 May 2021  and the fourth was adopted at the annual general meeting held on 31 May 2022. The warrants issued under the four incentive programmes entitle the holder to subscribe for shares in the Company from 1 June 2023 until and including 29 February 2024  from 1 June 2023 until and including 29 February 2024  from 1 June 2024 until and including 28 February 2025  and from 1 June 2025 until and including 1 June 2030  respectively. Allocation in the programmes is depending on salary level and time of employment and maximum allocation is conditional upon continued employment during a vesting period of two to three years. The share related incentive programs are designed to retain and attract long term qualified and committed personnel in a global oil and gas market setting. The program is available to select employees and has historically re-occurred annually. The board of directors has proposed that the annual general meeting 2023 resolves on an incentive program to employees and consultants to be implemented during a period of three years. The remuneration committee and the board of directors shall continuously evaluate whether to propose share related incentive programs at the annual general meeting. Pension Pension benefits  including health insurance  shall be premium defined unless the individual concerned is subject to defined benefit pension under mandatory collective bargaining agreement provisions. The pension premiums for premium defined pension shall amount to not more than 10 percent of the gross pension qualifying income. The Company will  at the minimum  follow statutory requirements for pension contributions in each applicable jurisdiction it operates. Other benefits Other benefits may include  inter alia  life insurance  health insurance and medical benefits  and shall be limited in value in relation to other remuneration and shall be paid only in so far as it is considered to be in accordance with the market for other members of executive managements holding corresponding positions on the employment market where the member in question is operating. Premiums and other costs relating to such benefits may amount to not more than 15 percent of the gross fixed remuneration. Termination and severance payment The notice period for termination given by the Company shall be no longer than six months for all members of the Executive Management  with a right to redundancy payment after the expiration of the notice period corresponding to not more than 100 percent of the gross fixed cash remuneration for a maximum of 12 months  meaning that the fixed remuneration and redundancy payment shall together not exceed 18 months’ gross fixed salary. Any right to redundancy payment shall decrease in situations where remuneration is received from another company. In any case  observed the aforementioned limitation  the notice period and the amount of the redundancy payment shall be defined  on a case by case basis  taking into consideration (i) the requirements of law applicable to the contract entered with the member of the Executive Management  (ii) the common practice of the location where such contract was entered  and (iii) the period that the member of Executive Management has been employed/ contracted by the Company prior to the notice of termination. Upon notice given by a member of the Executive Management  the notice period shall generally be six months for the CEO and three months for other members of the Executive Management. In the event a member of the Executive Management terminates his or her employment  no severance shall be payable. Consideration given to existing salaries and employment conditions for employees In the preparation of the board of directors’ proposal for these remuneration guidelines  salary and employment conditions for employees of the Company have been taken into account by including information on the employees’ total income  the components of the remuneration and increase and growth rate over time  in the board of directors’ basis of decision when evaluating whether the guidelines and the limitations set out herein are reasonable. The decision-making process to determine  review and implement the guidelines The board of directors has established a remuneration committee. The committee’s tasks include preparing the board of directors’ decision to propose guidelines for Executive remuneration. The board of directors shall prepare a proposal for new guidelines when there is need for significant changes and at least every fourth year  and submit it to the general meeting. The guidelines shall be in force until new guidelines are adopted by the general meeting. The committee shall also monitor and evaluate programs for variable remuneration for the Executive Management  the application of the guidelines for Executive remuneration as well as the current remuneration structures and compensation levels in the Company. The members of the committee are independent of the Company and its Executive Management. The CEO and other members of the Executive Management do not participate in the board of directors’ processing of and resolutions regarding remuneration-related matters in so far as they are affected by such matters. Information in regard to previously decided remuneration Except for recurring commitments  there are no remuneration commitments in relation to members of the Executive Management that have not become due. Description of material changes to the remuneration policy and explanation of how the shareholders’ opinions have been taken into account These guidelines are decided by the annual general meeting. The board of directors has  following the election of new board members on 3 November 2022 and 29 March 2023  assessed the need for changes and deemed the proposed changes to be necessary to successful implement the Company’s business strategy and safeguard its long-term interests  including its sustainability  and to be able to recruit and retain highly qualified and capable management. Pursuant to the proposed new remuneration policy the maximum yearly Extraordinary Variable Cash Remuneration may be paid on different extraordinary events per year provided that the maximum yearly amount is not exceeded. The proposed new remuneration policy is deemed to increase flexibility inter alia in recruiting and retaining executive management as well as deciding on remuneration for extraordinary performance beyond the individual’s ordinary tasks and/or as a premium for the performance of such individual on relevant events or transactions involving the Company. Within the proposed new policy the possible annual other benefits have increased from 10 percent to 15 percent of the gross fixed remuneration due to the Company’s potential costs for such benefits. The board of directors has not received any comments from shareholders. Item 15. Resolution on an incentive program and issuance of warrants to employees and consultants (LTIP 8) The board of directors in Maha Energy AB (publ) (the “Company”) proposes that the general meeting resolves on an incentive programme for the Executive Management and other employees and consultants of the Company and its subsidiaries (together  the “Group”) through issuance of warrants entitling to subscription of new shares in the Company as set forth below. Background The proposal to launch an incentive programme by the issuance of warrants is presented by the board of directors of the Company in order to strengthen the retention of Executive Management and other employees and consultants with the Group and to motivate these to create shareholder value. The board of directors assess that these objectives are in line with all shareholders’ interests. The programme encompasses current and future employees and consultants of the Group. Board members are not allowed to participate. Those entitled to participate in the incentive programme are hereinafter referred to as “Participants”. The programme will be implemented through transfer of warrants to Participants during a period of three years. Terms and conditions for the issue of warrants The Company shall issue not more than 4 612 345 warrants. Each warrant entitles to subscription of one (1) new share  each with a quotient value of SEK 0.011. The warrants may  with deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights  only be subscribed for by Maha Energy Inc (the “Subsidiary”)  a subsidiary of the Company  after which the Subsidiary is to transfer the warrants to the Participants in accordance with the resolution adopted by the general meeting and instructions from the board of directors of the Company. Subscription of warrants shall be made by the Subsidiary on a subscription list following the general meeting’s issue resolution  but no later than 31 May 2023. The board of directors of the Company shall be entitled to prolong the subscription period. The warrants shall be issued without consideration (i.e. free of charge) to the Subsidiary. If all issued warrants are subscribed for by the Subsidiary  transferred to and exercised by the Participants for subscription of new shares  the Company’s share capital will increase with SEK 50 735.795 (subject to potential recalculations in accordance with standard terms and conditions applicable to the warrants). The warrants may be exercised for subscription of new shares during the period as from registration of the warrants with the Swedish Companies Registration Office until and including 1 January 2030. Warrants that have not been exercised for subscription of new shares by 1 January 2030 shall lapse. Each warrant shall entitle the warrant holder to subscribe for one (1) new share in the Company at a subscription price per share (the “Exercise Price”) of SEK 8.50. Any amount that exceeds the quotient value shall be transferred to the nonrestricted share premium account. The Exercise Price may never be below the quotient value of the shares. The warrants are subject to customary recalculation conditions. Allocation principles to be applied in relation to Participants Warrants subscribed for by the Subsidiary shall be transferred to the Participants in accordance with instructions from the board of directors of the Company and the principles set forth below. Any resolution to transfer warrants to the Participants shall be made by the board of directors. The transfers of warrants from the Subsidiary to the Participants are to be made without consideration (i.e. free of charge). Warrants are granted under the incentive programme to employees of the Group  and are intended to align such individual’s and shareholder interests by attempting to create a direct relation between compensation and shareholder return. Participation in the incentive programme rewards overall corporate performance  as measured through the price of the shares in the Company. In addition  the incentive programme enables employees to develop and maintain a significant ownership position in the Company. No Participant may be offered more than 2 306 173 warrants. Allocated warrants may be exercised for subscription of new shares in the Company during the period as from registration of the warrants with the Swedish Companies Registration Office until and including 1 January 2030. Subscription of new shares may however not take place during so-called closed periods according to the EU Market Abuse Regulation  or otherwise in breach of relevant insider rules and regulations (including the Company’s internal guidelines in this respect). Warrant agreement All warrants will be governed by warrant agreements to be entered into between each Participant and the Subsidiary in connection with the transfer of warrants from the Subsidiary. The warrant agreement will include a so-called vesting structure  certain transfer restrictions and other terms and conditions customary for such agreements. The period from allocation of warrants until a share may be acquired may not be less than three years and the warrants shall vest in tranches of one third (1/3) of the allocated warrants per year during a total vesting period of three years. Exception may be made from the period until a share may be acquired and the vesting period in certain situations  such as (i) where the Participant’s employment or assignment as consultant is terminated or (ii) otherwise where exceptional circumstances exist as determined by the board of directors to allow flexibility for the Company in such situations. Such exceptions shall be included in the specific warrant agreements entered into with the Participants. Reasons for the deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights The reasons for the deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights is that the Company wishes to offer warrants to employees of the Group in order to strengthen the retention of employees and to motivate them to contribute to the creation of shareholder value. Dilution  costs  etc. Upon full subscription  transfer and exercise of all 4 612 345 issued warrants; a total of 4 612 345 new shares will be issued in the Company (subject to potential recalculations in accordance with standard terms and conditions applicable to the warrants). This would lead to a dilution corresponding to approx. 3 percent of the total share capital and number of votes in the Company (based on the share capital and number of shares in the Company as of the date of this proposal and calculated as the maximum amount of share capital and number of shares that may be issued  divided by the total share capital and the total number of shares in the Company after the proposed warrants to be issued have been exercised). The incentive programme is expected to have a marginal effect on the Company's earnings per share. The market value is preliminary estimated to SEK 5.22 per warrant  based on a market value of the underlying share corresponding to SEK 9.73 and the Exercise Price of SEK 8.50 per share. Costs related to the issuance of warrants under the incentive programme will be accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2 and recognized as an expense in the income statement during the vesting period. The preliminary estimate of total cost to be recorded during the term of the programme is SEK 24 075 519. Ongoing administration costs and other costs of the programme are minimal. Outstanding incentive programmes In addition  3 229 586 warrants are outstanding under four (4) Long Term Incentive Programs for employees and senior management of the Group  of which the first program comprises of 460 000 warrants (“Program Four”)  the second program comprises of 1 048 286 warrants (“Program Five”)  the third program comprises of 524 143 warrants (“Program Six”)  and the fourth program comprises of 1 197 157 warrants (“Program Seven”).

Miscellaneous The chairman of the board of directors  the managing director or a person appointed by the board of directors shall be authorised to make any minor adjustments required to register the resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office. Item 16. Resolution on an incentive program and issuance of warrants to the members of the board of directors (LTIP 9) The nomination committee in Maha Energy AB (publ) (the “Company”) (excluding Fabio Vassel) proposes that the general meeting resolves on an incentive programme for the members of the board of directors of the Company through issuance of warrants entitling to subscription of new shares in the Company as set forth below. Background The proposal to launch an incentive programme by the issuance of warrants is presented by the nomination committee in the Company (excluding Fabio Vassel) in order to strengthen the retention of the members of the board of directors and to motivate the board members to create shareholder value. The nomination committee assess that these objectives are in line with all shareholders’ interests. The programme encompasses board members in the Company. Those entitled to participate in the incentive programme are hereinafter referred to as “Participants”. The programme will be implemented through transfer of warrants to Participants during a period of three years. Terms and conditions for the issue of warrants The Company shall issue not more than 3 074 897 warrants. Each warrant entitles to subscription of one (1) new share  each with a quotient value of SEK 0.011. The warrants may  with deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights  only be subscribed for by Maha Energy Inc (the “Subsidiary”)  a subsidiary of the Company  after which the Subsidiary is to transfer the warrants to the Participants in accordance with the resolution adopted by the general meeting and instructions from the nomination committee of the Company. Subscription of warrants shall be made by the Subsidiary on a subscription list following the general meeting’s issue resolution  but no later than 31 May 2023. The board of directors of the Company shall be entitled to prolong the subscription period. The warrants shall be issued without consideration (i.e. free of charge) to the Subsidiary. If all issued warrants are subscribed for by the Subsidiary  transferred to and exercised by the Participants for subscription of new shares  the Company’s share capital will increase with SEK 33 823.867 (subject to potential recalculations in accordance with standard terms and conditions applicable to the warrants). The warrants may be exercised for subscription of new shares during the period as from registration of the warrants with the Swedish Companies Registration Office until and including 1 January 2030. Warrants that have not been exercised for subscription of new shares by 1 January 2030 shall lapse. Each warrant shall entitle the warrant holder to subscribe for one (1) new share in the Company at a subscription price per share (the “Exercise Price”) of SEK 8.50. Any amount that exceeds the quotient value shall be transferred to the nonrestricted share premium account. The Exercise Price may never be below the quotient value of the shares. The warrants are subject to customary recalculation conditions. Allocation principles to be applied in relation to Participants Warrants subscribed for by the Subsidiary shall be transferred to the Participants in accordance with instructions from the nomination committee of the Company and the principles set forth below. Fabio Vassel will not participate in any resolution to transfer warrants to himself. The transfers of warrants from the Subsidiary to the Participants are to be made without consideration (i.e. free of charge). Warrants are granted under the incentive programme to board members in the Company and are intended to align such individual’s and shareholder interests by attempting to create a direct relation between compensation and shareholder return. Participation in the incentive programme rewards overall corporate performance  as measured through the price of the shares in the Company. In addition  the incentive programme enables board members to develop and maintain a significant ownership position in the Company. No Participant may be offered more than 2 306 173 warrants. Allocated warrants may be exercised for subscription of new shares in the Company during the period as from registration of the warrants with the Swedish Companies Registration Office until and including 1 January 2030. Subscription of new shares may however not take place during so-called closed periods according to the EU Market Abuse Regulation  or otherwise in breach of relevant insider rules and regulations (including the Company’s internal guidelines in this respect). Warrant agreement All warrants will be governed by warrant agreements to be entered into between each Participant and the Subsidiary in connection with the transfer of warrants from the Subsidiary. The warrant agreement will include a so-called vesting structure  certain transfer restrictions and other terms and conditions customary for such agreements. The period from allocation of warrants until a share may be acquired may not be less than three years and the warrants shall vest in tranches of one third (1/3) of the allocated warrants per year during a total vesting period of three years. Exception may be made from the period until a share may be acquired and the vesting period in certain situations where exceptional circumstances to allow flexibility for the Company in such situations. Such exception shall be included in the specific warrant agreements entered into with the Participants. Reasons for the deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights The reasons for the deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights is that the Company wishes to offer warrants to the board members in the Company in order for the board members to take part in the value growth in the Company which is expected to increase the board members long-term commitment and strengthen the retention of board members  and to motivate them to contribute to the creation of shareholder value. Dilution  costs  etc. Upon full subscription  transfer and exercise of all 3 074 897 issued warrants; a total of 3 074 897 new shares will be issued in the Company (subject to potential recalculations in accordance with standard terms and conditions applicable to the warrants). This would lead to a dilution corresponding to approx. 2 percent of the total share capital and number of votes in the Company (based on the share capital and number of shares in the Company as of the date of this proposal and calculated as the maximum amount of share capital and number of shares that may be issued  divided by the total share capital and the total number of shares in the Company after the proposed warrants to be issued have been exercised). The incentive programme is expected to have a marginal effect on the Company's earnings per share. The market value is preliminary estimated to SEK 5.22 per warrant  based on a market value of the underlying share corresponding to SEK 9.73 and the Exercise Price of SEK 8.50 per share. Costs related to the issuance of warrants under the incentive programme will be accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2 and recognized as an expense in the income statement during the vesting period. The preliminary estimate of total cost to be recorded during the term of the programme is SEK 16 050 346. Ongoing administration costs and other costs of the programme are minimal. Outstanding incentive programmes In addition  3 229 586 warrants are outstanding under four (4) Long Term Incentive Programs for employees and senior management of the Group  of which the first program comprises of 460 000 warrants (“Program Four”)  the second program comprises of 1 048 286 warrants (“Program Five”)  the third program comprises of 524 143 warrants (“Program Six”)  and the fourth program comprises of 1 197 157 warrants (“Program Seven”). Each warrant under the respective program entitles to subscribe for one new share in the Company. The exercise price of the warrants corresponds to 100 percent of the volume weighted average last closing price for the Company’s share on Nasdaq First North Growth Market during the period from and including (i) 20 May 2020 until and including 27 May 2020 for Program Four  and corresponds to 100 percent of the volume weighted average last closing price for the Company’s share on Nasdaq Stockholm during the period from and including (ii) 21 May 2021 until and including 27 May 2021 for Program Five  (iii) 21 May 2021 until and including 27 May 2021 for Program Six  and (iv) 24 May 2022 until and including 31 May 2022 for Program Seven. The warrants may be exercised from and including (i) 1 June 2023 until and including 29 February 2024 for Program Four  (ii) 1 June 2024 until and including 28 February 2025 for Program Five  (iii) 1 June 2023 until and including 29 February 2024 for Program Six  and (iv) 1 June 2025 until and including 1 June 2030 for Program Seven.

The guidelines are applicable on agreements entered into after the annual general meeting held on 24 May 2023  and as far as changes are made to existing agreements  thereafter.Remuneration Policy for Maha Energy AB (publ)IntroductionPurposeThis remuneration policy encompass the Company’s Executive Management. The guidelines do not include remuneration decided by the general meeting. The board of directors may temporarily resolve to deviate from the guidelines  in whole or in part  if in a specific case there is special cause for the deviation and a deviation is necessary to serve the Company’s long-term interests  including its sustainability  or to ensure the Company’s financial viability. If such deviation occurs  this shall be disclosed for the next annual general meeting. Terms of employments governed by rules other than Swedish may be duly adjusted to comply with mandatory rules or established local practice  taking into account  to the extent possible  the overall purpose of these guidelines.Principles  promotion of the Company’s business strategy  long-term interests and sustainabilityThe board of directors assesses that the successful implementation of the Company’s business strategy and safeguarding of its long-term interests  including its sustainability  builds on the Company being able to recruit and retain highly qualified and capable management to achieve set goals. In order to achieve this  the Company must be able to offer competitive total remuneration which these guidelines enable.Remuneration shall not discriminate on grounds of gender  ethnic background  national origin  age  disability or other irrelevant factors.Types of remuneration etc.The main principle is that remuneration and other employment conditions for members of the Executive Management shall be based on market terms and be competitive in order to ensure that the group can attract and retain competent members of the Executive Management at a reasonable cost for the Company. The total remuneration to the Executive Management may consist of fixed cash remuneration  variable cash remuneration  pension benefits and other benefits. Additionally  the general meeting may – irrespective of these guidelines – resolve on  among other things  share or share price-related remuneration.Fixed cash remunerationEach member of the Executive Management shall be offered a fixed remuneration to be paid in cash and on market terms commensurate with the international oil and gas sector  based on responsibilities  sector and time experience and performances. The fixed remuneration shall be adjusted annually. In order to avoid that the Executive Management is encouraged to take inappropriate risks  there shall be a fundamental balance between fixed and variable remuneration. The fixed remuneration shall thus be large enough in relation to the total remuneration paid to the Executive Management in order to render it possible to reduce the variable remuneration to zero.Variable cash remunerationIn addition to the fixed remuneration  the members of the group’s Executive Management may be offered variable remuneration to be paid in cash  as follows:(i) Regular Variable Cash Remuneration: based on the result in relation to performance goals within the respective area of responsibility and in line with the shareholders’ interests. Regular Variable Cash Remuneration shall be tied to annual performance related objectives and shall amount to a maximum of 100 percent of the gross fixed remuneration.Regular Variable Cash Remuneration shall be based on clear  predetermined and measurable criteria and predefined individual and operational goals  which can be financial  such as budget control  or non-financial  such as non-productive time measurements or production volume related goals. By setting criteria for Regular Variable Cash Remuneration for the Executive Management linked to the Company’s earnings as well as sustainability  the Company’s business strategy  long-term interests and competitiveness are promoted. The fulfillment of these criteria shall be measured over a period of one year  and shall be determined based on the Company’s performance and the criteria agreed with the individual member of the Executive Management.(ii) Extraordinary Variable Cash Remuneration: further variable cash remuneration may be awarded in extraordinary circumstances  provided that such extraordinary arrangements are limited in time and only made on an individual basis  either for the purpose of recruiting or retaining executive management  or as remuneration for extraordinary performance beyond the individual’s ordinary tasks and/or as a premium for the performance of such individual on relevant events or transactions involving the Company. Such remuneration may be paid on different extraordinary events per year  but may not in total exceed an amount corresponding to 50 percent of the gross fixed annual cash remuneration.The Company’s remuneration committee shall propose and evaluate goals for variable remuneration for the group’s Executive Management (i) each year in case of Regular Variable Cash Remuneration  or (ii) when required based on the applicable circumstances  in case of Extraordinary Variable Cash Remuneration. The evaluation made by the remuneration committee shall be reported to the board of directors.Should variable remuneration paid have been based on information that later shows to have been evidently incorrect  the Company shall have the possibility to request repayment. Variable remuneration shall not be pension qualifying. Extraordinary variable cash remuneration may be compensated/offset with the regular variable cash remuneration  upon the sole discretion of the Board Members/CEO (as the case may be).Long-term share or share-price related incentive programmesLong-term share-related incentive programmes in the form of warrants giving right to subscribe for new shares have been implemented in the Company. Such programmes have been resolved by the general meeting and are therefore excluded from these guidelines. Warrants entitling the holder to subscribe for new shares in the Company have been issued and allocated to participants under four different incentive programmes for employees and senior management in the Company and its subsidiaries. The first incentive programme was adopted at the annual general meeting held on 27 May 2020  the second and third was adopted at the annual general meeting held on 27 May 2021  and the fourth was adopted at the annual general meeting held on 31 May 2022. The warrants issued under the four incentive programmes entitle the holder to subscribe for shares in the Company from 1 June 2023 until and including 29 February 2024  from 1 June 2023 until and including 29 February 2024  from 1 June 2024 until and including 28 February 2025  and from 1 June 2025 until and including 1 June 2030  respectively. Allocation in the programmes is depending on salary level and time of employment and maximum allocation is conditional upon continued employment during a vesting period of two to three years.The share related incentive programs are designed to retain and attract long term qualified and committed personnel in a global oil and gas market setting. The program is available to select employees and has historically re-occurred annually. The board of directors has proposed that the annual general meeting 2023 resolves on an incentive program to employees and consultants to be implemented during a period of three years. The remuneration committee and the board of directors shall continuously evaluate whether to propose share related incentive programs at the annual general meeting.PensionPension benefits  including health insurance  shall be premium defined unless the individual concerned is subject to defined benefit pension under mandatory collective bargaining agreement provisions. The pension premiums for premium defined pension shall amount to not more than 10 percent of the gross pension qualifying income.The Company will  at the minimum  follow statutory requirements for pension contributions in each applicable jurisdiction it operates.Other benefitsOther benefits may include  inter alia  life insurance  health insurance and medical benefits  and shall be limited in value in relation to other remuneration and shall be paid only in so far as it is considered to be in accordance with the market for other members of executive managements holding corresponding positions on the employment market where the member in question is operating.

Resolution on an incentive program and issuance of warrants to employees and consultants (LTIP 8)The board of directors in Maha Energy AB (publ) (the “Company”) proposes that the general meeting resolves on an incentive programme for the Executive Management and other employees and consultants of the Company and its subsidiaries (together  the “Group”) through issuance of warrants entitling to subscription of new shares in the Company as set forth below.BackgroundThe proposal to launch an incentive programme by the issuance of warrants is presented by the board of directors of the Company in order to strengthen the retention of Executive Management and other employees and consultants with the Group and to motivate these to create shareholder value. The board of directors assess that these objectives are in line with all shareholders’ interests.The programme encompasses current and future employees and consultants of the Group. Board members are not allowed to participate. Those entitled to participate in the incentive programme are hereinafter referred to as “Participants”.The programme will be implemented through transfer of warrants to Participants during a period of three years.Terms and conditions for the issue of warrantsThe Company shall issue not more than 4 612 345 warrants. Each warrant entitles to subscription of one (1) new share  each with a quotient value of SEK 0.011. The warrants may  with deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights  only be subscribed for by Maha Energy Inc (the “Subsidiary”)  a subsidiary of the Company  after which the Subsidiary is to transfer the warrants to the Participants in accordance with the resolution adopted by the general meeting and instructions from the board of directors of the Company. Subscription of warrants shall be made by the Subsidiary on a subscription list following the general meeting’s issue resolution  but no later than 31 May 2023. The board of directors of the Company shall be entitled to prolong the subscription period. The warrants shall be issued without consideration (i.e. free of charge) to the Subsidiary. If all issued warrants are subscribed for by the Subsidiary  transferred to and exercised by the Participants for subscription of new shares  the Company’s share capital will increase with SEK 50 735.795 (subject to potential recalculations in accordance with standard terms and conditions applicable to the warrants). The warrants may be exercised for subscription of new shares during the period as from registration of the warrants with the Swedish Companies Registration Office until and including 1 January 2030. Warrants that have not been exercised for subscription of new shares by 1 January 2030 shall lapse. Each warrant shall entitle the warrant holder to subscribe for one (1) new share in the Company at a subscription price per share (the “Exercise Price”) of SEK 8.50. Any amount that exceeds the quotient value shall be transferred to the nonrestricted share premium account. The Exercise Price may never be below the quotient value of the shares. The warrants are subject to customary recalculation conditions.Allocation principles to be applied in relation to ParticipantsWarrants subscribed for by the Subsidiary shall be transferred to the Participants in accordance with instructions from the board of directors of the Company and the principles set forth below. Any resolution to transfer warrants to the Participants shall be made by the board of directors.The transfers of warrants from the Subsidiary to the Participants are to be made without consideration (i.e. free of charge).Warrants are granted under the incentive programme to employees of the Group  and are intended to align such individual’s and shareholder interests by attempting to create a direct relation between compensation and shareholder return. Participation in the incentive programme rewards overall corporate performance  as measured through the price of the shares in the Company. In addition  the incentive programme enables employees to develop and maintain a significant ownership position in the Company. No Participant may be offered more than 2 306 173 warrants.Allocated warrants may be exercised for subscription of new shares in the Company during the period as from registration of the warrants with the Swedish Companies Registration Office until and including 1 January 2030. Subscription of new shares may however not take place during so-called closed periods according to the EU Market Abuse Regulation  or otherwise in breach of relevant insider rules and regulations (including the Company’s internal guidelines in this respect).Warrant agreementAll warrants will be governed by warrant agreements to be entered into between each Participant and the Subsidiary in connection with the transfer of warrants from the Subsidiary. The warrant agreement will include a so-called vesting structure  certain transfer restrictions and other terms and conditions customary for such agreements. The period from allocation of warrants until a share may be acquired may not be less than three years and the warrants shall vest in tranches of one third (1/3) of the allocated warrants per year during a total vesting period of three years. Exception may be made from the period until a share may be acquired and the vesting period in certain situations  such as (i) where the Participant’s employment or assignment as consultant is terminated or (ii) otherwise where exceptional circumstances exist as determined by the board of directors to allow flexibility for the Company in such situations. Such exceptions shall be included in the specific warrant agreements entered into with the Participants.Reasons for the deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rightsThe reasons for the deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights is that the Company wishes to offer warrants to employees of the Group in order to strengthen the retention of employees and to motivate them to contribute to the creation of shareholder value.Dilution  costs  etc.Upon full subscription  transfer and exercise of all 4 612 345 issued warrants; a total of 4 612 345 new shares will be issued in the Company (subject to potential recalculations in accordance with standard terms and conditions applicable to the warrants). This would lead to a dilution corresponding to approx. 3 percent of the total share capital and number of votes in the Company (based on the share capital and number of shares in the Company as of the date of this proposal and calculated as the maximum amount of share capital and number of shares that may be issued  divided by the total share capital and the total number of shares in the Company after the proposed warrants to be issued have been exercised).The incentive programme is expected to have a marginal effect on the Company's earnings per share. The market value is preliminary estimated to SEK 5.22 per warrant  based on a market value of the underlying share corresponding to SEK 9.73 and the Exercise Price of SEK 8.50 per share.Costs related to the issuance of warrants under the incentive programme will be accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2 and recognized as an expense in the income statement during the vesting period. The preliminary estimate of total cost to be recorded during the term of the programme is SEK 24 075 519. Ongoing administration costs and other costs of the programme are minimal.Outstanding incentive programmesIn addition  3 229 586 warrants are outstanding under four (4) Long Term Incentive Programs for employees and senior management of the Group  of which the first program comprises of 460 000 warrants (“Program Four”)  the second program comprises of 1 048 286 warrants (“Program Five”)  the third program comprises of 524 143 warrants (“Program Six”)  and the fourth program comprises of 1 197 157 warrants (“Program Seven”).

The exercise price of the warrants corresponds to 100 percent of the volume weighted average last closing price for the Company’s share on Nasdaq First North Growth Market during the period from and including (i) 20 May 2020 until and including 27 May 2020 for Program Four  and corresponds to 100 percent of the volume weighted average last closing price for the Company’s share on Nasdaq Stockholm during the period from and including (ii) 21 May 2021 until and including 27 May 2021 for Program Five  (iii) 21 May 2021 until and including 27 May 2021 for Program Six  and (iv) 24 May 2022 until and including 31 May 2022 for Program Seven. The warrants may be exercised from and including (i) 1 June 2023 until and including 29 February 2024 for Program Four  (ii) 1 June 2024 until and including 28 February 2025 for Program Five  (iii) 1 June 2023 until and including 29 February 2024 for Program Six  and (iv) 1 June 2025 until and including 1 June 2030 for Program Seven.Approval of transfer of warrants from the Subsidiary to ParticipantsA resolution to issue warrants in accordance with this proposal also includes an approval of the transfers of warrants from the Subsidiary to the Participants.Preparation of the proposalThis proposal has been prepared by the board of directors together with external consultants.

Payment of dividends will depend on market conditions  the Company's net income and the Company's ongoing charges ratio. Dividends will only be paid to the extent permitted in accordance with the Companies Act.4. Resolutions 4 to 8: Election of directorsIt is the policy of the Board to stand for re-election on an annual basis. Each of the existing Directors  John Leggate  Duncan Neale  Cathy Pitt  David Stevenson and Isabel Liu  will therefore retire from office with effect from the conclusion of the AGM unless re-elected  and will stand for re-election by the Shareholders by means of ordinary resolution.Brief biographies of each member of the Board standing for re-election can be found on page 51 of the 2022 Annual Report.Following an evaluation of the Directors conducted during the year  the Board believes that each Director offering him or herself for re-election continues to make an effective and valuable contribution and demonstrates commitment to the role.5. Resolutions 9 and 10: Appointment of auditors and auditors' remunerationResolution 9 relates to the appointment of BDO LLP as the Company's auditors to hold office until the conclusion of the Company's next annual general meeting. This resolution is recommended by the Company's audit committee and endorsed by the Board. Accordingly  it is proposed  as an ordinary resolution  to appoint BDO LLP as the Company's auditors. Similarly  resolution 10 authorises the Directors  upon recommendation from the Company's Audit Committee  to fix the auditors' remuneration.Special Business6. Resolution 11: Continuation of the CompanyThe articles of association of the Company (the ""Articles of Association"") provide that at the annual general meeting in 2023  and at every fifth annual general meeting thereafter  the Directors shall put forward an ordinary resolution to Shareholders proposing that the Company should continue as an investment trust. As five years have now passed since the Company's incorporation  resolution 11 is being proposed.Resolution 11 seeks shareholder approval for the Company to continue as an investment trust until the fifth annual general meeting following the date of this meeting. If this resolution is not passed  the Directors will be obliged to draw up proposals for the voluntary liquidation  reconstruction or other re-organisation of the Company for consideration by the shareholders of the Company in a General Meeting to be held within six months of the AGM.The Board is of the opinion that there is significant appetite from institutional and retail investors to acquire battery storage assets at the current time due to the attractive returns expected from these assets over the longer term thanks to the supportive underlying fundamentals in the sector. Therefore  the Board is of the view that shareholder value is best served by continuing to hold and operate these assets in an investment trust structure.The Board is therefore recommending that Shareholders vote in favour of Resolution 11.7. Resolutions 12 and 13: Directors' authority to allotResolutions 12 and 13 are intended to renew the Company's authority to allot Ordinary Shares and C Shares for cash or as consideration for the acquisition of investments. Accordingly  resolution 12 authorises the Board to allot Ordinary Shares and C Shares generally and unconditionally in accordance with section 551 of the Companies Act up to an aggregate nominal value of £541 290.35  representing approximately 10% of the issued ordinary share capital at the date of the Notice of AGM. Resolution 13 is conditional on resolution 12 being passed and applies in addition to resolution 12. Resolution 13 authorises the Board to allot Ordinary Shares and C shares generally and unconditionally in accordance with section 551 of the Companies Act up to an aggregate nominal value of a further £541 290.35  representing approximately 10% of the issued ordinary share capital at the date of the Notice of AGM.The Board believes that passing resolutions 12 and 13 are in Shareholders' interests given that these authorities are intended to be used to fund specific investment opportunities sourced by the Manager  either by issuing new shares for cash or as consideration for the acquisition of investments. In addition  new Ordinary Shares or C shares allotted under the authorities will (i) maintain the Company's ability to issue Ordinary Shares and C shares tactically  so as to manage the premium to net asset value per Ordinary Share or C share at which the Ordinary or C Shares trade; (ii) improve liquidity in the market for the Ordinary Shares and C shares ; and (iii) increase the size of the Company  thereby spreading operating costs over a larger capital base which should reduce the ongoing charges ratio.Ordinary Shares and C shares allotted under this authority will only be allotted at prices greater than the prevailing net asset value per share and a premium to cover the commissions  costs and expenses of the relevant allotment under the relevant placing.The authority granted pursuant to resolutions 12 and 13 shall expire on the earlier of the next annual general meeting of the Company  or 30 August 2024. The Directors consider it important to have the maximum flexibility commensurate with good corporate governance guidelines to raise finance to enable the Company to respond to market developments and conditions and therefore believes the authority sought to allot up to 20% of the existing issued ordinary share capital of the Company is appropriate.These resolutions are in addition to the powers to allot Ordinary Shares and C Shares granted to the Directors at the General Meeting of the Company held on 13 May 2022.8. Resolution 14: Disapplication of statutory pre-emption rightsResolution 14 is a special resolution which is being proposed to empower the Directors to disapply the pre-emption rights of existing Shareholders in relation to allotments (or sales from treasury) of Ordinary Shares for cash under resolution 13 (being in respect of Ordinary Shares up to an aggregate nominal value of £541 290.35  representing up to 10% of the Company's issued ordinary share capital as at the date of the Notice of AGM).Resolution 14 is conditional on resolution 12 being passed. In the event that resolution 12 is not passed  resolution 14 will not be proposed to the AGM.No allotment (or sale from treasury) of Ordinary Shares for cash without pre-emption rights will be made at a price less than the prevailing net asset value per Ordinary Share at the time of the relevant allotment (or sale).The powers granted by this resolution will expire on the earlier of the conclusion of the Company's next annual general meeting or 30 August 2024 and will permit the Board to allot Ordinary Shares (or sell Ordinary Shares from treasury) after expiry of the disapplication if it has agreed to do so beforehand.9. Resolution 15: Disapplication of statutory pre-emption rightsResolution 15 is conditional on resolution 13 being passed and applies in addition to resolution 14. Resolution 15 is a special resolution which is being proposed to empower the Directors to disapply the pre-emption rights of existing Shareholders in relation to allotments (or sales from treasury) of Ordinary Shares for cash under resolution 13 (being in respect of Ordinary Shares up to an aggregate nominal value of a further £541 290.35  representing up to 10% of the Company's issued ordinary share capital as at the date of the Notice of AGM).Resolution 15 is conditional on resolutions 12 and 13 being passed. In the event that resolution 12 and 13 are not passed  resolution 15 will not be proposed to the AGM.No allotment (or sale from treasury) of Ordinary Shares for cash without pre-emption rights will be made at a price less than the prevailing net asset value per Ordinary Share at the time of the relevant allotment (or sale).The powers granted by this resolution will expire on the earlier of the conclusion of the Company's next annual general meeting or 30 August 2024 and will permit the Board to allot Ordinary Shares (or sell Ordinary Shares from treasury) after expiry of the disapplication if it has agreed to do so beforehand.The Directors consider it important to have the maximum flexibility commensurate with good corporate governance guidelines to raise finance to enable the Company to respond to market developments and conditions and therefore believes the authority sought by Resolutions 14 and 15 to dis-apply pre-emption rights over up to 20% of the existing issued ordinary share capital of the Company is appropriate.These resolutions are in addition to the powers to disapply pre-emption rights granted to the Directors at the General Meeting of the Company held on 13 May 2022.10. Resolution 16: Market purchases of own sharesThis resolution seeks authority for the Company to make market purchases of its own Ordinary Shares from time to time and is proposed as a special resolution. If passed  the resolution gives authority for the Company to purchase up to 81 139 424 of its ordinary shares  or  if less  14.99% of the Company's issued ordinary share capital immediately prior to the passing of the resolution (excluding treasury shares).The resolution specifies the minimum and maximum prices which may be paid for any Ordinary Shares purchased under this authority. The authority will expire on the earlier of 30 August 2024 and the Company's next annual general meeting.The Board does not currently have any intention of exercising any authorities granted by resolution 16. In normal market circumstances the Directors intend to favour dividend distributions ahead of Ordinary Share repurchases in the market. However  if the Ordinary Shares have traded at a significant discount to net asset value per share  the Board may seek to prioritise the use of net income after the payment of dividends on market repurchases over other uses of capital. If the Board does decide that the Company should repurchase Ordinary Shares  purchases will only be made through the market for cash at prices below the estimated prevailing net asset value per Ordinary Share where the Directors believe such purchases will result in an increase in the net asset value per Ordinary Share and where the Board believes such purchases are in Shareholders' interests by addressing an imbalance in the demand and supply of shares available in the market at a particular point in time.The Company may either cancel any Ordinary Shares it purchases under this authority or transfer them into treasury (and subsequently sell or transfer them out of treasury or cancel them).The Company does not have any options or outstanding share warrants.11. Resolution 17: Length of noticeThe Companies Act requires the Company to give at least 21 clear days' notice for a general meeting of the Company (other than the AGM)  unless the Company:· has gained Shareholder approval for the holding of general meetings on 14 clear days' notice by passing a special resolution at the most recent AGM; and· offers the facility for the Shareholders to vote by electronic means.The Company would like to preserve its ability to call general meetings (other than the AGM) on less than 21 clear days' notice. Resolution 17 seeks such approval. It is intended that this shorter notice period would be used where the flexibility is merited by the business of the meeting and is thought to be in the interests of the Shareholders as a whole. Should this resolution be approved it will be valid until the earlier of 30 August 2024  or the Company's next annual general meeting  whichever is sooner (when it is intended that a similar resolution will be proposed).ACTION TO BE TAKEN BY SHAREHOLDERSAll Shareholders  whose names appear on the register of members at the record date shown below  are encouraged to vote via proxy at the AGM.Accordingly  please:· register your proxy appointment electronically at www.investorcentre.co.uk/eproxy;· request a hard copy form of proxy from the Registrar (see note 4); or· in the case of Shareholders who hold their shares in uncertificated form  please use the CREST electronic proxy appointment service (see note 5).Whether or not Shareholders intend to attend the AGM  Shareholders are asked to complete and return the Form of Proxy in accordance with the instructions printed on it and return it to Computershare Investor Services PLC  The Pavilions  Bridgwater Road  Bristol BS99 6ZY  as soon as possible and  in any event no later than 09.30 a.m. on Thursday  25 May 2023.

Members are entitled  however  to request a hard copy document at any time.3. Attending in person3.1. Shareholders are welcome to attend the AGM in person. Please notify the Company Secretary at GHEnergyStorageCoSec@jtcgroup.com should you wish to attend in person. This will be to facilitate access to the meeting and to make the appropriate arrangements for the meeting.3.2.

A member entitled to attend and vote at the meeting convened by the above Notice of AGM is entitled to appoint one or more proxies to exercise all or any of the rights of the members to attend and speak and vote in his/her place. If a member wishes to appoint more than one proxy and so requires additional proxy forms  the member should contact the Company's Registrar Computershare Investor Services PLC  The Pavilions  Bridgwater Road  Bristol BS99 6ZY. A proxy need not be a member of the Company.4.2. To appoint a proxy  please complete the form of proxy enclosed with this Notice of AGM or lodge a proxy instruction electronically via www.investorcentre.co.uk/eproxy. To be valid the forms of proxy  together with the power of attorney or other authority (if any) under which it is signed or a notarially certified or office copy of the same  must be completed and returned in accordance with the instructions printed thereon to the office of the Company's registrar or delivered by hand (during office hours) to the same address as soon as possible and in any event so as to arrive by not later than 09:30 a.m. on Thursday  25 May 2023.4.3. A vote withheld is not a vote in law  which means the vote will not be counted in the calculation of votes for or against the resolutions. If no voting indication is given  a proxy may vote or abstain from voting at his/her discretion. A proxy may vote (or abstain from voting) as he or she thinks fit in relation to any other matter put before the meeting.4.4.

Note that any amended proxy appointment or revocation received after the relevant cut-off time for receipt of proxy appointments (see above) may be disregarded.4.5.

If a quorum is not present within 15 minutes from the time appointed for the commencement of the meeting  the meeting will be adjourned to 09:30 a.m. on Friday  9 June 2023.4.7. Any person receiving a copy of this Notice of AGM as a person nominated by a member to enjoy information rights under section 146 of the Companies Act 2006 (a ""Nominated Person"") should note that the provisions in Notes concerning the appointment of a proxy or proxies to attend the meeting in place of a member  do not apply to a Nominated Person as only members have the right to appoint a proxy. However  a Nominated Person may have a right under an agreement between the Nominated Person and the member by whom he or she was nominated to be appointed  or to have someone else appointed  as a proxy for the meeting. If a Nominated Person has no such proxy appointment right or does not wish to exercise it  he/she may have a right under such an agreement to give instructions to the member as to the exercise of voting rights at the meeting.4.8. Nominated Persons should also remember that their main point of contact in terms of their investment in the Company remains the member who nominated the Nominated Person to enjoy information rights (or perhaps the custodian or broker who administers the investment on their behalf). Nominated Persons should continue to contact that member  custodian or broker (and not the Company) regarding any changes or queries relating to the Nominated Person's personal details and interest in the Company (including any administrative matter).4.9. The only exception to this is where the Company expressly requests a response from a Nominated Person.4.10. Pursuant to regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001  only members registered in the register of members of the Company by close of business two days (excluding non-working days) prior to the time fixed for the meeting shall be entitled to attend and vote at the meeting in respect of the number of Ordinary Shares registered in their name at such time. If the meeting is adjourned  the time by which a person must be entered on the register of members of the Company in order to have the right to attend and vote at the adjourned meeting is the close of business two days prior to the time of the adjournment. Changes to the register of members after the relevant times shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend and vote at the meeting.4.11. If the Chair  as a result of any proxy appointments  is given discretion as to how the votes the subject of those proxies are cast and the voting rights in respect of those discretionary proxies  when added to the interests in the Company's securities already held by the Chair  result in the Chair holding such number of voting rights that he has a notifiable obligation under the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules  the Chair will make the necessary notifications to the Company and the Financial Conduct Authority. As a result  any member holding 3 per cent. or more of the voting rights in the Company who grants the Chair a discretionary proxy in respect of some or all of those voting rights and so would otherwise have a notification obligation under the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules  need not make a separate notification to the Company and the Financial Conduct Authority.5. Appointment of proxies through CREST5.1. CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so by following the procedures described in the CREST manual which can be viewed at https://www.euroclear.com/about/en/business/Keylegaldocuments.html CREST personal members or other CREST sponsored members  and those CREST members who have appointed (a) voting service provider(s)  should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting provider(s)  who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf. In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST service to be valid  the appropriate CREST message (a ""CREST Proxy Instruction"") must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear's specifications and must contain the information required for such instructions  as described in the CREST manual. The message  regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or an amendment to the instruction given to a previously appointed proxy must  in order to be valid  be transmitted so as to be received by the issuer's agent (CREST ID 3RA50) by not later than 09:30 a.m. on Thursday  25 May 2023. For this purpose  the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST applications host) from which the issuer's agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. After this time  any change of instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should be communicated to the appointee through other means.5.2. CREST members and  where applicable  their CREST sponsors or voting service providers should note that Euroclear does not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages.

Given the firm’s focus on cost efficiency  Normalized Fixed Operating Expenses in 2023 are still expected to be in the range of €175m - €185m as communicated previously.Management CommentsMike Kuehnel  CEO  stated:“It was an honor to succeed Dennis as CEO of Flow Traders on 1 February and I’m highly excited about the long-term growth opportunities for the firm’s multi-faceted business. We continue to investigate attractive growth and investment opportunities globally that align with our core business while diligently executing and implementing the firm’s existing growth strategy as outlined in our Capital Markets Update (CMU) last July.“Irrespective of a significantly changed and challenging market environment  Flow Traders delivered another robust quarter as our ongoing strategic trading diversification continues to increase the resilience of the business alongside attractive results. Once again  we demonstrated the highly accretive nature of our trading capital with returns of 65%  achieved amidst an ever-evolving market backdrop. From a cost efficiency perspective  it was encouraging to see that our fixed operating expenses base reduced slightly in the quarter versus last quarter and we will continue to focus on increasing the underlying efficiency of the business as we leverage the investments made in prior years.“Enhancing our broader employee talent pool  remaining a top employer of choice in our sector and reinforcing our commitment to our Diversity  Equity & Inclusion Policy continue to be key strategic focus areas. Accordingly  we were excited to have hosted our first ever ‘Connecting Women in Fintech’ event in collaboration with Euronext in February and launched on International Women’s Day a partnership with ‘FemaleXFinance’  an organization focused on fostering talent in the field of finance.“We continue to be excited about Flow Traders’ future growth prospects  driven by our ongoing asset class and geographical diversification  growth in strategic optionality  and the structural tailwinds from long-term industry trends including the shift to passive investing  electronification  digitalization and regulation.”Folkert Joling  Chief Trading Officer  added:“The business delivered a solid trading performance in the first quarter with all regions contributing meaningfully across all asset classes. We continue to expand and broaden our trading activities further in different products and asset classes and this is exemplified in the resiliency of the business through different market cycles. While there were some disruptions in certain segments of the market in the quarter as a result of the banking crises in the U.S. and Europe  our robust and prudent approach to risk management meant we remained active in providing liquidity to the market. It is also promising to note the start of a recovery across the digital assets markets during the first quarter.

The policy is to exclude or adjust items that are considered to be significant in both nature or size and where the treatment as an adjusted item provides stakeholders with useful information to assess the year-on-year or quarter-on-quarter underlying performance. On this basis  the following items were adjusted or excluded for the Q123 trading update: Removal of IFRS 2 treatment of share-based payments which include the deferral of a portion of the current year share plans as well as recognition of prior years’ share plans. This adjustment provides insights into the relationship between the current year variable employee expenses and current year trading performance. Other income line includes all the realized and unrealized results on Flow Traders’ long-term equity investments whether accounted for as Fair Value Other Comprehensive Income (FV OCI)  Fair Value Profit and Loss (FVPL) or Results of Equity Accounted Investments. Exclusion of one-off expenses which relate specifically to the completed corporate holding structure update. These are not considered to be part of the underlying operating expenses of the business. Tax expenses are adjusted based upon the pre-tax adjustments and/or excluded items above.IFRS Financial Overview and Normalized to IFRS Reconciliation€million Q123 Q422 Change Q123 Q122 Change Total income 110.5 115.5 (4%) 110.5 148.0 (25%) Net trading income 110.5 115.7 (5%) 110.5 148.7 (26%) Other income - (0.2) - - (0.8) - Employee expenses1 44.9 46.6 (4%) 44.9 54.9 (18%) Technology expenses 16.6 16.4 1% 16.6 13.8 20% Other expenses 7.3 7.9 (7%) 7.3 5.9 24% One-off expenses5 1.5 1.5 0% 1.5 3.3 (55%) Total operating expenses 70.3 72.4 (3%) 70.3 77.9 (10%) EBITDA 40.2 43.2 (7%) 40.2 70.1 (43%) Profit before tax 34.7 38.0 (9%) 34.7 66.1 (47%) Net profit 27.7 29.5 (6%) 27.7 52.3 (47%) Basic EPS2 (€) 0.64 0.68 0.64 1.20 Fully diluted EPS3 (€) 0.62 0.65 0.62 1.17 EBITDA margin 36% 37% 36% 47%Normalized EBITDA and margin are based on the relevant profit share percentage of operating result for the relevant financial period without any IFRS 2 adjustments for share-based payments.

At his arrival  the site was hit by a power cut  which the local branch of the hard-left CGT union said was a protest action.French President Emmanuel Macron listens to school children  parents and teachers as he visits a middle school  Thursday  April 20  2023 in Ganges  southern France. Daniel Cole/Copyright 2023 The AP. All rights reserved.Dozens of police were deployed in the small town to prevent protesters from getting close to the school. They briefly used tear gas to disperse people who tried to storm the barriers.Raising the retirement age ignited a months-long firestorm of protest. Opponents were further infuriated after Macron’s government in March chose to use a special constitutional power to pass the reform without a vote in parliament.Later Thursday  Macron made a surprise stop in another small town in southern France  Perols  where he walked in the streets to meet with some residents in a relaxed atmosphere  shaking hands and doing selfies.To a woman who told him she disagreed with the way he forced the pension changes through parliament  calling it undemocratic  he said  smiling: “I'm not going to resign”.“You don't care what people want ” the woman answered.On Wednesday  Macron went to eastern France  where he mingled among a crowd for the first time since he enacted the law last week. Many seized the occasion to voice their anger.The CGT union has called for scattered protest actions across the country.Macron has argued that raising the retirement age is needed to keep the French pension system afloat amid an aging population. Unions and other opponents say wealthy taxpayers or companies should pitch in more instead  and see the reform as an erosion of France’s social safety net.In Paris  hundreds of people Thursday held a peaceful demonstration at the Gare de Lyon train station.They later headed to the business district of La Defense  west of the capital  where they briefly stormed the building of the European stock exchange Euronext  brandishing flares.“We want to show that the mobilisation continues ” Fabien Villedieu  head of Sud Rail union  told the Associated Press. “There’s no way we’re going to let this reform pass.”Villedieu said the action at Euronext aimed to show “where the money is"".“France has never been so rich  never have the multinationals in France been so rich. The problem is the distribution of wealth.”Earlier Thursday  some protesters in the northern city of Lille walked along the railway line  blocking all train traffic for about one hour. They then left peacefully.Several unions joined a strike at the national railway company SNCF  slightly disrupting train traffic Thursday. Some regional lines and Paris suburban trains were affected  while high-speed trains were running almost as normal  the SNCF said.",negative,0.0,0.0,1.0,mixed,0.04,0.09,0.86,True,English,"['new retirement age', 'Anger', 'protests', 'France', 'Gare de Lyon train station', 'European stock exchange Euronext', 'French President Emmanuel Macron', 'hard-left CGT union', 'social safety net', 'Sud Rail union', 'special constitutional power', 'The CGT union', 'national railway company', 'French pension system', 'Paris suburban trains', 'train traffic', 'power cut', 'railway line', 'high-speed trains', 'pension changes', 'retirement age', 'small town', 'new effort', 'education policies', 'local branch', 'Daniel Cole', 'The AP', 'tear gas', 'months-long firestorm', 'surprise stop', 'relaxed atmosphere', 'first time', 'aging population', 'wealthy taxpayers', 'peaceful demonstration', 'business district', 'La Defense', 'Associated Press', 'northern city', 'one hour', 'regional lines', 'middle school', 'school children', 'protest actions', 'pension reform', 'southern France', 'eastern France', 'new law', 'retirement protests', 'other opponents', 'Fabien Villedieu', 'Several unions', 'Euronews', 'Hundreds', 'people', 'visit', 'scattered', 'trip', 'Ganges', 'government', 'furor', 'Demonstrators', 'anthem', 'teachers', 'students', 'arrival', 'site', 'parents', 'Copyright', 'rights', 'Dozens', 'police', 'protesters', 'barriers', 'March', 'vote', 'parliament', 'Perols', 'streets', 'residents', 'hands', 'selfies', 'woman', 'Wednesday', 'crowd', 'occasion', 'anger', 'country', 'companies', 'erosion', 'capital', 'building', 'flares', 'mobilisation', 'head', 'money', 'multinationals', 'problem', 'distribution', 'Lille', 'strike', 'SNCF']",2023-04-21,2023-04-22,euronews.com

Our existing portfolio company MEMX also welcomed a new funding round in the quarter to support the launch of the MEMX Options exchange.To date  Flow Traders Capital has made a total of 25 investments representing a total value of €27.0m.Share Buyback ProgramAs of 20 April 2023  the total number of shares purchased under the ongoing €40m share buyback program is 1 159 791 shares at an average price of €21.33 for a total consideration of €24.7m. The purpose of the current buyback program is to return excess capital to shareholders. The intention is that shares repurchased as part of this program will initially be held in treasury and may be cancelled going forward.3 249 770 shares are held in treasury as at 20 April 2023 with 1 227 124 treasury shares repurchased for the purpose of satisfying the requirements of various employee incentive plans and 2 022 646 shares repurchased for the purpose of returning excess capital to shareholders.OutlookWhile the number of FTEs has increased slightly from the end of FY22 given the ongoing commitment to onboard additional talent in key growth areas  FTEs are expected to remain broadly flat during 2023 given expected attrition. Given the firm’s focus on cost efficiency  Normalized Fixed Operating Expenses in 2023 are still expected to be in the range of €175m - €185m as communicated previously.Management CommentsMike Kuehnel  CEO  stated:“It was an honor to succeed Dennis as CEO of Flow Traders on 1 February and I’m highly excited about the long-term growth opportunities for the firm’s multi-faceted business. We continue to investigate attractive growth and investment opportunities globally that align with our core business while diligently executing and implementing the firm’s existing growth strategy as outlined in our Capital Markets Update (CMU) last July.“Irrespective of a significantly changed and challenging market environment  Flow Traders delivered another robust quarter as our ongoing strategic trading diversification continues to increase the resilience of the business alongside attractive results. Once again  we demonstrated the highly accretive nature of our trading capital with returns of 65%  achieved amidst an ever-evolving market backdrop. From a cost efficiency perspective  it was encouraging to see that our fixed operating expenses base reduced slightly in the quarter versus last quarter and we will continue to focus on increasing the underlying efficiency of the business as we leverage the investments made in prior years.“Enhancing our broader employee talent pool  remaining a top employer of choice in our sector and reinforcing our commitment to our Diversity  Equity & Inclusion Policy continue to be key strategic focus areas. Accordingly  we were excited to have hosted our first ever ‘Connecting Women in Fintech’ event in collaboration with Euronext in February and launched on International Women’s Day a partnership with ‘FemaleXFinance’  an organization focused on fostering talent in the field of finance.“We continue to be excited about Flow Traders’ future growth prospects  driven by our ongoing asset class and geographical diversification  growth in strategic optionality  and the structural tailwinds from long-term industry trends including the shift to passive investing  electronification  digitalization and regulation.”Folkert Joling  Chief Trading Officer  added:“The business delivered a solid trading performance in the first quarter with all regions contributing meaningfully across all asset classes. We continue to expand and broaden our trading activities further in different products and asset classes and this is exemplified in the resiliency of the business through different market cycles. While there were some disruptions in certain segments of the market in the quarter as a result of the banking crises in the U.S. and Europe  our robust and prudent approach to risk management meant we remained active in providing liquidity to the market. It is also promising to note the start of a recovery across the digital assets markets during the first quarter. We believe that going forward these markets will see a more prominent role for fully regulated players such as Flow Traders.”Preliminary Financial Calendar26 April 2023 AGM28 April 2023 FY22 final dividend proposed ex-dividend date2 May 2023 FY22 final dividend proposed record date4 May 2023 FY22 final dividend proposed payment date30 June 2023 Start silent period ahead of 1H23 results28 July 2023 Release 1H23 results (inc. analyst conference call)15 August 2023 Proposed FY23 interim dividend ex-dividend date16 August 2023 Proposed FY23 interim dividend record date18 August 2023 Proposed FY23 interim dividend payment date30 September 2023 Start silent period ahead of 3Q23 trading update26 October 2023 Release Q322 trading update (no analyst conference call)Contact DetailsFlow Traders Ltd.InvestorsEric PanPhone: +31 20 7996180Email: investor.relations@flowtraders.comMediaLaura PeijsPhone: +31 20 7996125Email: press@flowtraders.comAbout Flow TradersFlow Traders is a leading global financial technology-enabled liquidity provider in financial products  historically specialized in Exchange Traded Products (ETPs)  now expanding into other asset classes.

The policy is to exclude or adjust items that are considered to be significant in both nature or size and where the treatment as an adjusted item provides stakeholders with useful information to assess the year-on-year or quarter-on-quarter underlying performance. On this basis  the following items were adjusted or excluded for the Q123 trading update: Removal of IFRS 2 treatment of share-based payments which include the deferral of a portion of the current year share plans as well as recognition of prior years’ share plans. This adjustment provides insights into the relationship between the current year variable employee expenses and current year trading performance. Other income line includes all the realized and unrealized results on Flow Traders’ long-term equity investments whether accounted for as Fair Value Other Comprehensive Income (FV OCI)  Fair Value Profit and Loss (FVPL) or Results of Equity Accounted Investments. Exclusion of one-off expenses which relate specifically to the completed corporate holding structure update. These are not considered to be part of the underlying operating expenses of the business. Tax expenses are adjusted based upon the pre-tax adjustments and/or excluded items above.IFRS Financial Overview and Normalized to IFRS Reconciliation€million Q123 Q422 Change Q123 Q122 Change Total income 110.5 115.5 (4%) 110.5 148.0 (25%) Net trading income 110.5 115.7 (5%) 110.5 148.7 (26%) Other income - (0.2) - - (0.8) - Employee expenses1 44.9 46.6 (4%) 44.9 54.9 (18%) Technology expenses 16.6 16.4 1% 16.6 13.8 20% Other expenses 7.3 7.9 (7%) 7.3 5.9 24% One-off expenses5 1.5 1.5 0% 1.5 3.3 (55%) Total operating expenses 70.3 72.4 (3%) 70.3 77.9 (10%) EBITDA 40.2 43.2 (7%) 40.2 70.1 (43%) Profit before tax 34.7 38.0 (9%) 34.7 66.1 (47%) Net profit 27.7 29.5 (6%) 27.7 52.3 (47%) Basic EPS2 (€) 0.64 0.68 0.64 1.20 Fully diluted EPS3 (€) 0.62 0.65 0.62 1.17 EBITDA margin 36% 37% 36% 47%Normalized EBITDA and margin are based on the relevant profit share percentage of operating result for the relevant financial period without any IFRS 2 adjustments for share-based payments.

The Group did not recognize corporate income tax expense for 2022. The loss per share was €0.21 and €0.23 per share in 2022 and 2021  respectively.Net cash outflow from operating activities of 2022 totalled €11.3 million  compared to €8.8 million the previous year. The increased cash outflow was primarily due to the PRIMAvera clinical trial in Europe for which the Company reached its enrolment and implantation target of 38 patients at the originally communicated date of December  2022. The study is being conducted in clinical sites in France  Germany  the UK  the Netherlands and Italy. Furthermore  the manufacturing of remote rehabilitation systems for patients in clinical trials as well as costs related to the preparation of financing options  lead to an increase in spending  which were partially offset by reduced expenses associated with the French and US feasibility studies.Until 31 December 2022  investments in fixed and intangible assets remained low leading to a net cash outflow from investment activities of €0.1 million.On 31 December 2022  net cash provided by financing activities totalled €4.6 million  following the drawdown of the first tranche of the convertible note (“ORNAN 2022”) signed with ESGO in July 2022 for a total of €5.5 million  and for which the Company received a total amount of €4.6 million (in net proceeds).Pixium Vision ended 2022 with a net cash position of €7.7 million  compared to €14.5 million at the end of 2021.Cash position on March 31  2023 (unaudited) and key developments since the beginning of 2023:At March 31  2023  Pixium Vision ‘s cash position amounted to €4.7 million  compared to €7.7 million on January 1  2023.As indicated in a previous press release (link)  Pixium Vision continues to actively seek financing options to support its strategic ambitions and to prevent insolvency. At the same time  the Company continues to implement cost reduction measures with the intention to extend its cash runway until approximately the end of July 2023 vs the originally announced cash runway of June 2023.The Company has mandated two investment banks to assist it in its search for investors worldwide.The Company is aware that the investment of capital into Pixium Vision by one or more new investors could be time consuming  and the effective capital injection of funds might be delayed beyond July 2023. Therefore the Company is also investigating solutions to ensure the financing of its activity during such period (between the end of July 2023 and the investment of a new investor).Since the beginning of 2023 Pixium Vision continued its positive momentum in its clinical  regulatory and product development.On January 12  2023  Pixium Vision announced publication of peer-reviewed articles demonstrating the potential of the Next Generation PRIMA implant.On February 13  2023  Pixium Vision announced the termination of the convertible note financing agreement with US-based healthcare investor ESGO.On March 17  2023  Pixium Vision announced the reduction of share capital  due to losses  by reduction of nominal value: number of shares unchanged.On March 31  2023  announced the adjudication of Breakthrough Device Designation by the FDA in the United States for the Prima System in Dry AMD.ContactsPixium VisionOffer NonhoffChief Financial Officer investors@pixium-vision.com Media RelationsLifeSci AdvisorsSophie Baumontsophie@lifesciadvisors.com+33 6 27 74 74 49 Investor RelationsLifeSci AdvisorsGuillaume van Renterghemgvanrenterghem@lifesciadvisors.com+41 76 735 01 31ABOUT PIXIUM VISIONPixium Vision is creating a world of bionic vision for those who have lost their sight  enabling them to regain visual perception and greater autonomy.

23489,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/anger-new-retirement-age-fuels-protests-france-98742695,Anger at new retirement age fuels further protests in France,Hundreds of protesters opposed to France raising the retirement age from 62 to 64 have demonstrated in a southern town during a visit by President Emmanuel Macron,Hundreds of protesters opposed to France raising the retirement age from 62 to 64 have demonstrated in a southern town during a visit by President Emmanuel MacronGANGES  France -- Hundreds of people opposed to the new law raising the retirement age from 62 to 64 demonstrated Thursday in a small town in southern France during a visit by President Emmanuel Macron  while scattered protests were staged elsewhere.Macron’s trip to Ganges comes amid a concerted new effort by him and his government to move on from the furor caused by the pension reform.Demonstrators sang what has become the anthem of the retirement protests: “We are here  we are here  even if Macron doesn’t want (us to be here)  we are here.”The French president met with teachers and students at a middle school  where he promoted his education policies. At his arrival  the site was hit by a power cut  which the local branch of the hard-left CGT union said was a protest action.Dozens of police were deployed in the small town to prevent protesters from getting close to the school. They briefly used tear gas to disperse people who tried to storm the barriers.Raising the retirement age ignited a months-long firestorm of protest. Opponents were further infuriated after Macron’s government in March chose to use a special constitutional power to pass the reform without a vote in parliament.Later Thursday  Macron made a surprise stop in another small town in southern France  Perols  where he walked in the streets to meet with some residents in a relaxed atmosphere  shaking hands and doing selfies.To a woman who told him she disagreed with the way he forced the pension changes through parliament  calling it undemocratic  he said  smiling: “I'm not going to resign.”“You don't care what people want ” the woman answered.On Wednesday  Macron went to eastern France  where he mingled among a crowd for the first time since he enacted the law last week. Many seized the occasion to voice their anger.The CGT union has called for scattered protest actions across the country.Macron has argued that raising the retirement age is needed to keep the French pension system afloat amid an aging population. Unions and other opponents say wealthy taxpayers or companies should pitch in more instead  and see the reform as an erosion of France’s social safety net.In Paris  hundreds of people Thursday held a peaceful demonstration at the Gare de Lyon train station.They later headed to the business district of La Defense  west of the capital  where they briefly stormed the building of European stock exchange Euronext  brandishing flares.“We want to show that the mobilization continues ” Fabien Villedieu  head of Sud Rail union  told the Associated Press. “There’s no way we’re going to let this reform pass.”The action at Euronext aims at showing “where the money is ” Villedieu said. “France has never been so rich  never have the multinationals in France been so rich. The problem is the distribution of wealth.”Earlier Thursday  some protesters in the northern city of Lille walked along the railway line  blocking all train traffic for about one hour. They then left peacefully.Several unions joined a strike at the national railway company SNCF  slightly disrupting train traffic Thursday. Some regional lines and Paris suburban trains were affected  while high-speed trains were running almost as normal  the SNCF said.___Corbet reported from Paris.

(the “Company” or “AB Science”)  NYSE Euronext – FR0010557264 – AB)  announces today the implementation of a new strategy and the launch  in support of this new strategy  of a capital increase through the issuance of new ordinary shares with attached warrants  with a waiver of preferential subscription rights  via a private placement for a maximum amount of approximately 15.0 million euros (the “Capital Increase”).I. FOCUS OF THE DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY ON AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS WITH THE MASITINIB PLATFORM  ON THE SECOND MICROTUBULE PLATFORM AND SEARCH FOR PARTNERSHIPS FOR NON-RARE DISEASE INDICATIONS OF MASITINIBAB Science has decided to focus its development strategy as follows:Allocation of current resources primarily to the development of masitinib for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and the development of the microtubule destabilizer agents (MDA) platform  with the clinical development of AB8939 in refractory acute myeloid leukemia and the initiation of regulatory preclinical development of a new oral molecule in the same microtubule class for sarcoma and solid tumors.We want to focus the majority of our clinical resources on the development of rare diseases with masitinib  on the development of the microtubule platform with AB8939 and future molecules of the same family due to the very encouraging first results.Acceleration of the process of seeking a license for masitinib in non-rare disease indications  with priority given to progressive forms of multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease.This acceleration is possible now that the confirmatory Phase 3 studies have been approved by the FDA in the United States and the major European agencies. To this end  the Company has retained the services of a leading investment bank.This license search is a priority in the Company's strategy  given the number of clinical studies already conducted and the maturity of the pipeline  and given the additional investments required to complete the clinical program  up to market authorizations. We want to highlight that the duration of this license search is not predictable and that the realization of a license is dependent on a number of factors and is not guaranteed. However  the milestones reached at this stage are essential factors that contribute to the feasibility of this strategy.As a result of the focus strategy  AB Science has decided to adapt its organization  which should lead to a significant reduction in costs. This strategic focus reinforces and sustains the existing agreement between certain shareholders of AB Science and Alain Moussy.II. LAUNCH OF A CAPITAL INCREASE OF A MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY 15.0 MILLION EUROSThe Capital Increase  for a maximum amount of 15.0 million euros (premium included)  would entail an issuance of 2 608 695 shares with attached warrants. Taking into account the exercise of the warrants  the maximum amount of the Capital Increase (premium included) could be increased by an amount of 26.3 million euros (i.e. a total of 3.9 million new ordinary shares).The proceeds of the Capital Increase will provide AB Science with the additional resources necessary to finance its activities over the next twelve months. In particular  the raised funds will be directly used:circa 8.0 million euros for the clinical development of masitinib in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other orphan indications;circa 3.0 million euros for the development of the AB Science microtubule destabilizer agents platform;for the reminder  to finance  together with operational products of the Company  R&D and operational costs.The Capital Increase will also support the strategy detailed above.Terms of the Capital IncreaseThe Capital Increase will consist of a private placement pursuant to Articles L. 225-136 of the French Commercial Code and L. 411-2 1° of the French Monetary and Financial Code. The Capital Increase will be carried out with a waiver of preferential subscription rights  pursuant to the delegation of authority granted to the Board of Directors under the 20th resolution of the Combined General Shareholders’ Meeting of June 29  2023.The Capital Increase will take the form of an issue of new ordinary shares (the “New Shares”) to each of which will be attached a share subscription warrant (the “Warrants”).The issue price of the New Shares has been set at 5.75 euros (0.01 euro par value and 5.74 euros issue premium) and the exercise price of the Warrants at 8.63 euros. The issue price reflects (i) a 10% discount to the weighted average of the Company’s share price on the regulated market of Euronext Paris during the last three trading sessions preceding the setting of the issue price (the “3-Day VWAP”)  i.e. 6.3878 euros  and (ii) a 20% discount to the 3-Day VWAP  including the theoretical value of one Warrant.One Warrant is attached to each New Share. Two Warrants give the right to subscribe for one new ordinary share of the Company  at a price of 8.63 euros per share  i.e. 150% of the issue price of the New Shares.The Warrants may be exercised from January 1st  2025 to December 31  2030.The theoretical value of each Warrant  assuming a volatility of 40% and based on the 3-Day VWAP  amounts to 0.6235 euros according to the Black & Scholes formula  representing 9.99% of the 3-Day VWAP.The Warrants will be immediately detached from the New Shares upon their issuance and will not be listed.Indicative timetableThe order book will be built before the opening of the market on April 24  2023  subject to any early closing.The number of New Shares will be announced in a subsequent press release by AB Science no later than April 24  2023 and as soon as possible following the closing of the order book.The settlement-delivery of the new ordinary shares to be issued in the context of the Capital Increase and their listing on Euronext Paris are expected to occur on April 28  2023 at the latest. The new shares will bear current dividend rights and will be listed on the regulated market on Euronext Paris under ISIN code: FR0010557264 – AB.Commitment of certain historical shareholdersCertain historical shareholders of AB Science have indicated their intention to for New Shares up to 10.5 million euros (in cash and by offsetting existing receivables)  representing up to approximately 70% of the maximum amount of the Capital Increase.The press release announcing the results of the Capital Increase will include a capitalization table post Capital Increase.This renewed support from the Company’s historical shareholders underlines their confidence in the Company’s strategy and technologies.Restructuring of convertible bonds issued in February 2022 and Class C preferred sharesAB Science and the holders of the convertible bonds issued in February 2022 have negotiated a framework agreement under which the terms and conditions of the bonds would be amended as follows: on July 15  2023  all the convertible bonds would be automatically converted into ordinary shares of AB Science on the basis of a price per share of 5.75 euros (i.e. the subscription price of the New Shares).A framework agreement has also been negotiated with the holders of Class C preferred shares (the “C Preferred”). The C Preferred would be repurchased by AB Science for one symbolic euro (and subsequently cancelled). 520 786 share warrants (each warrant entitling the holder to subscribe for one ordinary share of AB Science at par value for a period of 12 months) will be issued in substitution of the C Preferred. In addition  still in substitution of the C Preferred  a new class of preferred shares would be created  benefiting from priority dividend rights (equal to 1.25% of the net sales of masitinib or of any licensing royalties  up to a limit of 9.0 million euros) and convertible into 750 000 ordinary shares of AB Science if the share price of AB Science exceeds a threshold of 30 euros for more than 90 consecutive days.These agreements will be submitted to AB Science shareholders for approval at the next annual general shareholders meeting  Alain Moussy having declared that he was in favour of the planned restructuring.Finally  it will be proposed to the shareholders to extend the term of certain lines of warrants already issued  to adapt to the evolution of AB Science’s strategy and of its clinical pipeline.Information available to the publicThe Capital Increase will not be subject to a prospectus approved by the French Financial Market Authority (the “AMF”). AB Science draws the attention of the public to the risk factors relating to the Company and its business described in its annual management reports and press releases  which are available free of charge on the Company's website (www.ab-science.com).In addition  the main risks specific to securities are as follows:The existing shareholders who do not participate in the Capital Increase will see their shareholding in the share capital of AB Science diluted  and this shareholding may also be diluted in the event of exercise of the Warrants  as well as in the event of new securities transactions.AB Science may be unable to raise all the expected proceeds of the Capital Increase.The volatility and liquidity of AB Science shares could fluctuate significantly. The sale of Company shares may occur on the secondary market  after the Capital Increase  and have a negative impact on the Company share price.About masitinibMasitinib is a novel oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets mast cells and macrophages  key immune cells  through inhibition of a limited number of kinases. Due to its unique mode of action  masitinib can be developed in a wide range of diseases  including oncology  inflammatory diseases  and certain central nervous system diseases. In oncology  through its immunotherapy activity  masitinib may have an effect on survival  alone or in combination with chemotherapy. Through its activity on mast cells and microglial cells and therefore its inhibitory effect on the activation of the inflammatory process  masitinib may have an effect on the symptoms associated with certain inflammatory and central nervous system diseases.About AB8939AB8939 is a new synthetic microtubule-destabilizing drug. Preclinical data show that AB8939 has broad anticancer activity  with a notable advantage over standard chemotherapies that target microtubules of being able to overcome P-glycoprotein (Pgp) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) mediated drug resistance. Development of drug resistance often restricts the clinical efficacy of microtubule-targeting chemotherapy drugs (for example  taxanes and vinca alkaloids); thus  AB8939 has strong potential to be developed in numerous oncology indications.About AB ScienceFounded in 2001  AB Science is a pharmaceutical company specializing in the research  development and commercialization of protein kinase inhibitors (PKIs)  a class of targeted proteins whose action are key in signaling pathways within cells.

The study is being conducted in clinical sites in France  Germany  the UK  the Netherlands and Italy. Furthermore  the manufacturing of remote rehabilitation systems for patients in clinical trials as well as costs related to the preparation of financing options  lead to an increase in spending  which were partially offset by reduced expenses associated with the French and US feasibility studies.Until 31 December 2022  investments in fixed and intangible assets remained low leading to a net cash outflow from investment activities of €0.1 million.On 31 December 2022  net cash provided by financing activities totalled €4.6 million  following the drawdown of the first tranche of the convertible note (“ORNAN 2022”) signed with ESGO in July 2022 for a total of €5.5 million  and for which the Company received a total amount of €4.6 million (in net proceeds).Pixium Vision ended 2022 with a net cash position of €7.7 million  compared to €14.5 million at the end of 2021.Cash position on March 31  2023 (unaudited) and key developments since the beginning of 2023:At March 31  2023  Pixium Vision ‘s cash position amounted to €4.7 million  compared to €7.7 million on January 1  2023.As indicated in a previous press release (link)  Pixium Vision continues to actively seek financing options to support its strategic ambitions and to prevent insolvency.

Therefore the Company is also investigating solutions to ensure the financing of its activity during such period (between the end of July 2023 and the investment of a new investor).Since the beginning of 2023 Pixium Vision continued its positive momentum in its clinical  regulatory and product development.On January 12  2023  Pixium Vision announced publication of peer-reviewed articles demonstrating the potential of the Next Generation PRIMA implant.On February 13  2023  Pixium Vision announced the termination of the convertible note financing agreement with US-based healthcare investor ESGO.On March 17  2023  Pixium Vision announced the reduction of share capital  due to losses  by reduction of nominal value: number of shares unchanged.On March 31  2023  announced the adjudication of Breakthrough Device Designation by the FDA in the United States for the Prima System in Dry AMD.ContactsPixium VisionOffer NonhoffChief Financial Officer investors@pixium-vision.com Media RelationsLifeSci AdvisorsSophie Baumontsophie@lifesciadvisors.com+33 6 27 74 74 49 Investor RelationsLifeSci AdvisorsGuillaume van Renterghemgvanrenterghem@lifesciadvisors.com+41 76 735 01 31ABOUT PIXIUM VISIONPixium Vision is creating a world of bionic vision for those who have lost their sight  enabling them to regain visual perception and greater autonomy.

Furthermore  the manufacturing of remote rehabilitation systems for patients in clinical trials as well as costs related to the preparation of financing options  lead to an increase in spending  which were partially offset by reduced expenses associated with the French and US feasibility studies.Until 31 December 2022  investments in fixed and intangible assets remained low leading to a net cash outflow from investment activities of €0.1 million.On 31 December 2022  net cash provided by financing activities totalled €4.6 million  following the drawdown of the first tranche of the convertible note (“ORNAN 2022”) signed with ESGO in July 2022 for a total of €5.5 million  and for which the Company received a total amount of €4.6 million (in net proceeds).Pixium Vision ended 2022 with a net cash position of €7.7 million  compared to €14.5 million at the end of 2021.Cash position on March 31  2023 (unaudited) and key developments since the beginning of 2023:At March 31  2023  Pixium Vision ‘s cash position amounted to €4.7 million  compared to €7.7 million on January 1  2023.As indicated in a previous press release (link)  Pixium Vision continues to actively seek financing options to support its strategic ambitions and to prevent insolvency. At the same time  the Company continues to implement cost reduction measures with the intention to extend its cash runway until approximately the end of July 2023 vs the originally announced cash runway of June 2023.The Company has mandated two investment banks to assist it in its search for investors worldwide.The Company is aware that the investment of capital into Pixium Vision by one or more new investors could be time consuming  and the effective capital injection of funds might be delayed beyond July 2023. Therefore the Company is also investigating solutions to ensure the financing of its activity during such period (between the end of July 2023 and the investment of a new investor).Since the beginning of 2023 Pixium Vision continued its positive momentum in its clinical  regulatory and product development.On January 12  2023  Pixium Vision announced publication of peer-reviewed articles demonstrating the potential of the Next Generation PRIMA implant.On February 13  2023  Pixium Vision announced the termination of the convertible note financing agreement with US-based healthcare investor ESGO.On March 17  2023  Pixium Vision announced the reduction of share capital  due to losses  by reduction of nominal value: number of shares unchanged.On March 31  2023  announced the adjudication of Breakthrough Device Designation by the FDA in the United States for the Prima System in Dry AMD.ContactsPixium VisionOffer NonhoffChief Financial Officer investors@pixium-vision.com Media RelationsLifeSci AdvisorsSophie Baumontsophie@lifesciadvisors.com+33 6 27 74 74 49 Investor RelationsLifeSci AdvisorsGuillaume van Renterghemgvanrenterghem@lifesciadvisors.com+41 76 735 01 31ABOUT PIXIUM VISIONPixium Vision is creating a world of bionic vision for those who have lost their sight  enabling them to regain visual perception and greater autonomy.

This remuneration report is part of the Corporate Governance Statement  which is a part of the annual report. The remuneration report will be submitted to the annual general shareholders' meeting for approval. Remuneration policy Nyrstar's remuneration policy is designed to: enable Nyrstar to retain talented persons; andpromote sustainable business performance. The remuneration awarded to the members of the Board of Directors and the managers substantially changed following the implementation of the restructuring that was announced by the Company on 15 April 2019 and completed on 31 July 2019 (the ""Restructuring""). All members of the Executive Management were employees of Nyrstar Sales & Marketing AG  a legal entity which is part of the operating group that was transferred to NN2 Newco Limited on the Restructuring. Immediately following the Restructuring  the Company no longer had an Executive Management nor any employees. Remuneration policy as of 2021 As the Company was not placed into effective liquidation during 2020  steps were taken to implement a remuneration policy in accordance with article 7:89/1 of the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations. Such remuneration policy was submitted to and approved by the general shareholders' meeting on 29 June 2021 (the ""Remuneration Policy""). Nyrstar has not proposed any changes to be reflected in the Remuneration Policy. Remuneration and compensation in 2022 Directors The level of pay for the Board of Directors is regularly assessed against both European peer companies as well as companies listed on Euronext Brussels benchmark stock market index (BEL 20). Remuneration During 2022  the following gross remuneration was paid to the directors  pursuant to the decisions of the general shareholders' meeting held on 27 April 2011  as amended and supplemented from time to time. It is noted that the below remuneration is only fixed remuneration and that the total amount of remuneration is therefore not split out between base salary and variable remuneration. In accordance with the currently existing remuneration principles  non-executive directors do not receive variable remuneration nor are they entitled to other benefits other than customary directors' and officers' insurance. No pension expenses were awarded. 1Remuneration cost Paid in cash Martyn Konig € 200 000 € 200 000 Carole Cable € 70 000 € 70 000  which consists of: - a fixed fee of €50 000 per year for membership of the Board of Directors; - a fixed fee of €10 000 per year for membership of the Audit Committee; and - a fixed fee of €10 000 per year for membership of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee. Anne Fahy € 80 000 € 80 000  which consists of: - a fixed fee of €50 000 per year for membership of the Board of Directors; - a fixed fee of €20 000 per year for chairmanship of the Audit Committee; and - a fixed fee of €10 000 per year for membership of Nomination and Remuneration Committee. Jane Moriarty € 75 000 € 75 000  which consists of: - a fixed fee of €50 000 per year for membership of the Board of Directors; - a fixed fee of €10 000 per year for membership of the Audit Committee; and - a fixed fee of €15 000 per year for chairmanship of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee. Other benefits The Company has implemented customary directors' and officers' insurance coverage. The D&O insurance that was placed for the benefit of the Company's directors in 2022 has a liability limit of €1 million in aggregate. This insurance was brokered by Aon and placed at a cost of approximately €224 569. Certain Management Services In 2019  all members left the Management Committee following the completion of the Restructuring and the Management Committee was dissolved. Immediately following the Restructuring on 31 July 2019  the Company ceased to have any direct employees. Under the terms of the deed for the sale by the Company of assets and shares to NN2 Newco Limited that was executed as part of the Restructuring (the ""Sale Deed"")  certain limited executive services were provided to the Company by NN2 Newco Limited until the exercise of the put option. 2The put option that the Company exercised on 28 July 2022  for a fixed amount of EUR 20 million  was in relation to its entire 2% shareholding in NN2 NewCo Limited  which holds the former Nyrstar operational group (the ""Put Option""). Up until the exercise of the Put Option  these limited executive services were provided to the Company at no charge and included certain finance  tax  corporate counsel  IT and administration services. In addition  during 2022  the Company retained certain individuals to provide financial  legal and administrative services through consultancy agreements. Directors' and other interests Deferred Shares In the years 2016 to 2018  the general shareholders' meeting approved that each of the non-executive directors referred to below (the ""Eligible Directors"") would be remunerated for his or her Director's mandate for the period from the respective general shareholders' meeting until the annual general shareholders' meeting of the following year in the form of ""deferred shares units"" of the Company  and not in cash  subject to the conditions set out below. The remuneration in shares for each Eligible Director was limited to the portion set out next to his or her name below (the ""Eligible Share Remuneration"") of the aggregate remuneration that applies to the director's mandate of the relevant Eligible Director in accordance with the principles that have been determined by the annual general shareholders' meeting of the Company held on 27 April 2011 and that otherwise would have been payable in cash (the ""Eligible Remuneration""). The shares will not vest immediately  but will effectively vest and be delivered on the earlier of (i) the end of the Director's mandate as an Eligible Director  or (ii) a change of control over the Company. The shares are granted for free (i.e. for no additional consideration). Under the terms of the deferred shares units  the number of shares to be granted to an Eligible Director shall be equal to (i) the amount of the Eligible Remuneration that would otherwise have been paid in cash  divided by (ii) the average closing price of the Company's shares during the ten trading days preceding the date of the respective general shareholders' meeting that approved each grant  whereby the result is rounded down to the nearest whole number. The current Eligible Directors and their respective Eligible Share Remuneration that have been paid in deferred shares are as follows: Ms. Anne Fahy: EUR 10 000 of her Eligible Remuneration; (ii) Ms. Carole Cable: 50% of her Eligible Remuneration; and (iii) Mr. Martyn Konig: 100% of his Eligible Remuneration. The Company's Nomination and Remuneration Committee was authorised to further document the grant and to determine the terms and conditions of the grant  which contain customary adjustment clauses to take into account and mitigate the effect of corporate actions  dilutive transactions and similar events  such as (but not limited to) stock splits  reverse stock splits  mergers and de-mergers  dividend payments  other distributions on shares  rights offerings  and share buy-backs. The Board did not propose a remuneration in deferred share units of the Company for the non-executive directors at the annual general shareholders' meeting of the Company that was held on 28 June 2022. The Company did not grant any deferred share units (""DSU"") to its Directors in 2022. In the period 2016 to 2019  DSU were granted to certain directors as approved by the respective AGMs in 2016 to 2018.

The 2022 financial report is also attached to the Company's OSE filing as well as available to view on the Alternus Energy website at https://alternusenergy.com/reports-presentations/Revenue surged as capacity and power production expanded rapidly with new projects connecting in Poland and the Netherlands  and as the Company benefited from the hike in energy rates across Europe during 2022. Operating profit swung to the positive on greater gross profit contribution and disciplined expense control. The development pipeline grew substantially  with over 721MW of capacity under development or contracted  with exclusive rights to acquire another 800+ MW.Highlights for Q4 2022 wereSecured €500 million project financing facility led by Deutsche Bank to fund construction of the development portfolio over the next three years.Announced plan to list on Nasdaq in the U.S. via a business combination with Clean Earth Acquisitions Corp.Formed Altnua an expert development business to drive organic growthPower production increased 33% to 22.6 GWhBooked revenues increased 7% to $6.1 millionGross profit of $4.5 million vs Q4 2021 gross profit of $2.4 millionNet loss of $27.7 million due primarily to one-time write off of $23.9 million in costs relating to acquisitions no longer pursued and reclassification of previously capitalized costsEBITDA increased 100% to $0.7 millionHighlights for FY 2022 were:Power production increased 118% to 187.6 GWhBooked revenues increased 52% to $32.5 millionAnnual recurring revenue of c. $28 million is c. 86% of total revenueGross profit of $23.3 million vs 2021 gross profit of $14.2 millionNet loss of $35.8 million driven by one-time write-offsEBITDA increased 82% to $12.2 millionOperating assets grew 15% to 165.4MWpTotal portfolio (operating + development) increased 436% to 886MWSubsequent Events:Subsidiary Solis Bond Company secured temporary waivers for Green Bond covenants.Announced revised Business Combination Agreement featuring lower equity valuation and smaller ""Earnout"" share award reflecting reduced near term EBITDA targets from a revised focus on lower equity requirement higher return projects going forward.Commenting on the results  Vincent Browne  Chairman and Group CEO  said:""2022 was another strong year overall for Alternus. On the operating side  we more than doubled our power sold as we brought online projects in the Netherlands and purchased additional assets in Poland  which complement our strong presence in Romania and Italy. This resulted in outstanding financial performance  with revenue up 50% and operating profit of $5 million. On the development side  our pipeline is expanding rapidly  creating great visibility for our long-term forecast. Beyond the 166 MW of capacity that is operating today  we have 587 MW that we own and are developing  another 139 MW under contract  and exclusive rights to another 800+ MW. All in  the pipeline is well over 2 GW of capacity  the majority of which we expect to come online in the next few years. This visibility  along with the expertise and dedication of our team  gives us high confidence in our 2025 forecast of over $150 million of EBITDA  and for even greater growth in subsequent years.""Alternus Chief Financial Officer Joseph Duey added:""Our primary challenge is funding this explosive level of growth  a good-to-have problem for which we made real progress in 2022. In the fourth quarter we announced a transaction to list on Nasdaq in the U.S.  that should provide greater access to more equity capital at an attractive cost. We recently adjusted the terms of the transaction to reflect market conditions and our desire to invest even more in growth over the next couple of years. Furthermore  we secured a €500 million commitment to project financing from Deutsche Bank. Between this new source of project financing  the proceeds from the transaction  and the ability to access equity capital as needed in the future  we are confident that we can fund the aggressive growth plan we are putting in place.""Results Underpinned by a Diversified Portfolio of AssetsThe table below summarizes the Company's diversified portfolio of assets as of 31 December 2022.Operating (MWs DC) Owned Developing (MWs DC) Contracted (MWs DC) 2022 Power Sold (GWh) 2022 Revenue (USD mil) 2022 Gross Profit (USD mil) Poland 88.4 98.3 10.7 2.5 Romania 40.1 52.2 13.7 10.1 Netherlands 25.4 24.9 4.5 3.9 Italy 10.5 439 11.2 3.4 6.6 Spain - 128 139 Germany 0.7 0.6 0.2 0.16 U.S.A. 0.4 15 0.4 0.02 0 Total 165.4 582 139 187.6 32.5 23.26During the year  Poland grew to be the Company's primary market  with capacity up 14% and power production up 388% due to full years of production from the Witnica and SIG 24 parks. In the Netherlands  capacity and production more than doubled  as Alternus EPC arm  Unisun Energy BV  completed the construction of a new 14MW solar park at the Rotterdam Airport. In the company's other major markets of Romania and Italy  capacity was stable. Production grew 26% in Romania due to a full year of operation  while production in Italy was stable.The Development portfolio continued to grow steadily year-on-year in conjunction with co-development partners in Italy and Spain. Alternus also acquired its first parks in the US with a combined total of 15MW that is expected to come on-stream during 2024. At the end of 2022  had 582MW under management. Of this approximately 150MW are set to reach construction within 12 months from today with a further 300MW in the following 12 months.Solid Q4 2022 Results Cap Year of Stellar PerformanceThe Company made striking operational and financing progress to finish the year. The Company announced the formation of Altnua  a wholly owned subsidiary  a dedicated team of industry experts led by seasoned management with decades of experience. The Altnua team will take the current development portfolio forward and will focus on developing further utility scale projects from the ground up in Europe and the U.S. Altnua seeks to bridge the gaps between landowners  local developers  and corporate off-takers to drive organic growth for Alternus. Altnua will also acquire development businesses to scale their portfolios.In October  Alternus announced that it will list in the U.S. via a merger with Clean Earth Acquisitions Corp.  a ""blank check"" Special Purpose Acquisition Company listed on the Nasdaq market (NASDAQ: CLIN). Alternus expects to consummate the merger in the second quarter of 2023.In December  the Company secured a senior debt facility with Deutsche Bank to provide up to €500 million of project financing to fund the construction of owned development assets as they reach that stage of the cycle and support the acquisition of additional solar PV assets throughout Europe. The facility has an approved initial amount of €80 million yet to be drawn.The table below summarizes the Company's financial performance for the fourth quarter of 2022.Q4 2022 % Growth Q4 2021 Total Revenue 6.1 7% 5.7 Gross Profit 4.5 88% 2.4 Gross Margin 74% 32% 42% Operating Profit (0.1) (0.8) Other Expense One-Time (23.9) - Total Other Expense (0.5) (1.5) Net Loss (27.7) (6.1) EBITDA 0.7 0.4Strong 2022 Growth Reflects Execution of Growth PlanThe table below summarizes the Company's financial performance for the full year 2022.2022 % Growth 2021 ARR c. 28.0 8% c. 26.0 Total Revenue 32.5 52% 21.4 Gross Profit 23.3 64% 14.2 Gross Margin 72% 67% Operating Profit 5.0 (2.9) Other Expense One-Time (23.9) - Total Other Expense (41.3) (15.6) Net Loss (35.8) (18.8) EBITDA 12.2 6.7 Cash 3.0 18.0 Total Assets 208.5 209.5 Debt 188.1 169.7 Total Liabilities 229.4 192.9Revenue surged as production came online in Poland  the Netherlands  coupled with higher energy rates received from power sold. Gross profit contribution grew faster than revenue due to expected economies of scale from increased operations and bringing more parks under in-house operations and maintenance company Uper Energy Europe. Combined with disciplined expense control  the Group swung to an operating profit. The net loss was driven by ongoing interest expense combined with one-time charges related primarily to terminated acquisitions and reclassification of previously capitalized costs.Alternus ended the year with total debt of $188 million  of which $150 million is non-recourse project debt.Subsequent Events Strengthen OutlookAfter the close of the year  the Company announced two material developments that it believes strengthens its growth outlook.Green Bond Covenant WaiverOn March 21  2023  Alternus announced that its wholly owned subsidiary Solis Bond Company reached an agreement with the holders of €200 million of ""green bonds"" to temporarily waive certain covenants to allow time for the Company to cure certain threshold breaches resulting primarily from a terminated acquisition in Poland and lower gross margins in Romania due to higher than anticipated power acquisition costs in the fourth quarter. The Company has taken the necessary activities to meet the terms of the waivers and is confident of a successful outcome that will also ultimately lower long term debt costs.Amended Business Combination AgreementOn April 18  2023  Alternus announced that it had agreed to an amendment to the Business Combination Agreement (""BCA"") with Clean Earth Acquisitions Corp. The revisions include a reduced equity value of Alternus  reduced potential ""Earnout"" shares  and a reduction in the associated adjusted EBITDA targets for 2023 and 2024 and 2025. Both Alternus and Clean Earth  in conjunction with their advisors  believe the revised valuation will be attractive to investors upon completion of thetransaction and to support the continued growth of the business going forward.About Alternus Energy Group PlcAlternus Energy Group Plc is an international vertically integrated independent power producer (IPP).
