23516,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/makes-deutsche-boerse-ag-dboey-160004664.html,What Makes Deutsche Boerse AG (DBOEY) a New Strong Buy Stock,Deutsche Boerse AG (DBOEY) has been upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy)  reflecting growing optimism about the company's earnings prospects. This might drive the stock higher in the near term.,Deutsche Boerse AG (DBOEY) could be a solid addition to your portfolio given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). This rating change essentially reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system.Since a changing earnings picture is a powerful factor influencing near-term stock price movements  the Zacks rating system is very useful for individual investors. They may find it difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts  as these are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.As such  the Zacks rating upgrade for Deutsche Boerse AG is essentially a positive comment on its earnings outlook that could have a favorable impact on its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship  as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.For Deutsche Boerse AG  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.Story continuesHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsAs empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements  tracking such revisions for making an investment decision could be truly rewarding. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.The Zacks Rank stock-rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell)  has an impressive externally-audited track record  with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>.Earnings Estimate Revisions for Deutsche Boerse AGFor the fiscal year ending December 2023  this company is expected to earn $1.07 per share  which is a change of 17.6% from the year-ago reported number.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Deutsche Boerse AG. Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 8.6%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So  the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here >>>The upgrade of Deutsche Boerse AG to a Zacks Rank #1 positions it in the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions  implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company currently has 294 356 419 shares outstanding  compared with 22 158 901 as of June 30th  2020  a 13.3-fold increase.The strategy spearheaded by the new management team since April 2022 has enabled Visiomed Group to transform itself into a fast-growing  healthy and structurally profitable company. The implementation of a discretionary share buyback program now appears to be a natural and indispensable step.The Board of Directors therefore considered that the buyback and cancellation of shares should be a priority.The Board of Directors also plans to extend the share buyback policy beyond October 19th  2023 should the Company's next Extraordinary General Meeting approve a resolution instituting a new program.DESCRIPTION OF THE SHARE BUYBACK PROGRAM1. Date of the General Meeting authorizing the share buyback programThe General Meeting of April 19th  2022  via its ninth resolution  authorized the Board of Directors  with the option of sub-delegation under the prevailing legal and regulatory conditions  to purchase  cause to be purchased  hold  sell or transfer  on one or more occasions  its own shares under a share buyback program subject to the provisions of Articles L. 22-10-62 et seq. of the French Commercial Code.The program announced today  approved by decision of the Board of Directors on April 11th  2023  follows on from this authorization.2. Objectives of the share buyback programVisiomed Group highlights that the General Meeting of April 19th  2022  via its ninth resolution  set the following objectives for the Company's share buyback program:Promote the liquidity and stimulate the price of the Company's shares on the Euronext Growth Paris stock market  or any other market  through an investment service provider acting independently within the framework of a liquidity contract compliant with the code of ethics recognized by the Autorité des Marchés Financiers (French market regulator);Deliver the shares purchased in payment or exchange as part of a merger  demerger or transfer;Cancel all or part of the shares by way of a capital reduction under the terms of the powers granted by the same General Meeting in its sixteenth (16th) resolution;Allocate shares to employees or officers of the Company and of French or foreign companies or groupings related to it  in accordance with legal and regulatory conditions  notably as part of profit-sharing schemes  employee shareholding or company savings plans  the stock option plan  or by way of grants of free shares or any other schemes permitted by regulations;Allocate the shares purchased on the exercise of rights attached to securities and entitling the holder  by redemption  conversion  exchange  presentation of a warrant or in any other way  to existing shares to be issued by the Company;Where applicable  allocate the shares purchased in the course of implementing any market practice that may be accepted by the Autorité des Marchés Financiers and which complies with the regulations in force at the time of the effective buyback of the shares  it being stipulated that the Company would in such a case inform its shareholders by means of a press release.3. Maximum percentage of capital  maximum number of shares  characteristics of the shares to be purchased  maximum purchase price and other termsIn compliance with the ceilings approved at the General Meeting of April 19  2022  the share buyback program will be implemented under the following conditions:Maximum percentage buyback authorized: 10% of the share capital  i.e. 29 435 641 shares on the basis of 294 356 419 shares comprising the share capital as of the date of publication of this press release.

It is stipulated that the amount of the share capital used to calculate this ceiling may be adjusted by the Board of Directors  as needed  to take into account transactions affecting the share capital subsequent to this press release  and that the purchases made by the Company may not under any circumstances cause it to hold  directly or indirectly through its subsidiaries  more than 10% of its share capital;Maximum purchase price per share (excluding fees and commissions): EUR 1.50. This means the theoretical maximum amount that can be spent on the buyback program is EUR 44 021 775 based on the maximum percentage buyback authorized and the amount of shares currently held as treasury stock  excluding brokerage fees;The number of shares purchased may not exceed 10% of the number of shares comprising the share capital as of the date of such purchases.

These measures include the following:The Company intends to continue to deliver on a number of important milestones in 2023 that are strategic to its business  and that are also expected to further demonstrate the potential of the Company's products. These milestones include: the submission of alfapump PMA with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA); the validation of the Company's second-generation DSR product (DSR 2.0) effect in US patients; the expected positive developments from CMS (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services) on the ""Transitional Coverage of Emerging Technologies"" (TCET) - an initiative for accelerated Medicare coverage of breakthrough devices; the submission of a peer-reviewed publication and presentation on alfa pump and the POSEIDON clinical study at a forthcoming medical liver meeting; and the submission of a peer-reviewed publication on the DSR clinical studies.

In addition  the Company has already carried out several measures in order to reduce costs and expenditures  and the Company intends to carry out further savings. Subject to closing of the Offering  these measures will also include: Slowing down the further progression of the MOJAVE clinical study. The board of directors notes that (i) the Company still targets results from the first 3 patients by Q4 2023 for the safety cohort  and (ii) the first patients are most important as the Company is looking for confirmation that DSR 2.0 in US patients has same dramatic treatment effect as DSR 1.0 in the patients from Republic of Georgia (cfr. SAHARA and RED DESERT studies); Delaying the establishment of a new production facility for the US alfapump program; and In relation to the European alfapump commercial strategy reducing the Company's European commercial team by moving to a ""reactive"" rather than ""proactive"" commercial stance (i.e.  ready to act on clinician interest and maintaining dialogue with key centres  instead of actively promoting the therapy). The board of directors notes that (i) the platform for training US clinicians and implanting teams remains available  and (ii) it intends to scale-up the European commercial teams in the future (when additional financing has been attracted).The Company is also assessing to what extent partnerships or licensing arrangements could be entered into regarding its alfapump and DSR products in order to support the further development  regulatory approval process  and subsequent marketing. While on the date hereof no concrete plans are on the table  the Company continuously engages with potential partners  which could also provide further funding to the Company's business. The Company has furthermore control over its spendings  and management can timely and adequately reduce budgeted expenditures should this be necessary in the context of the Company's going concern.The Company notes that upon the completion of the Offering  the Company's (non-consolidated) accounting net assets (as defined in the Belgian Companies and Associations Code) will again cross above the thresholds of the articles 7:228 and 7:229 of the Belgian Companies and Associations Code.For more information  please contact:Sequana MedicalLies VannesteDirector Investor RelationsE: IR@sequanamedical.comT: +32 (0)498 053579Optimum Strategic CommunicationsNick Bastin  Jonathan Edwards  Vici RabbettsE: Sequana@optimumcomms.comT: +44 (0) 208 078 4357About Sequana MedicalSequana Medical NV is a pioneer in treating fluid overload  a serious and frequent clinical complication in patients with liver disease  heart failure and cancer.
