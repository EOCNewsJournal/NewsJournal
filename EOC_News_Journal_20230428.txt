The calculated exercise price shall be rounded off to nearest even hundredth of a SEK  whereupon SEK 0.005 will be rounded to SEK 0.01. The exercise price and number of shares that each stock option confers right to acquire may be re-calculated in the event of a bonus issue  reverse share split or share split  rights issue  etc.  whereby the re-calculation terms in the terms for Warrants 2023/2026:1 shall apply.The Employee Stock Option Program 2023/2026 shall be offered  at one or several occasions  to (i) all existing and future senior executives and other employees within the Company's American group until and including 31 August 2023 and (ii) the existing and future key individuals that (personally or through companies) work within the Company's American group as of the mentioned date and who are selected by the board of directors based on their importance for the group.

Oversubscription may not occur. In the event that any individual within the abovementioned categories does not subscribe for their full share  such share may be transferred to another category.The Company's board of directors shall not be included in the employee stock option program 2023/2026.Notice of participation in the Stock Option Program 2023/2026 shall be received by the Company on 31 July 2023 at the latest with a right for the board of directors to prolong the time limit.

If a participant ceases to be an employee or terminates his/her employment with the group before a vesting date  the already vested stock options may be exercised at the ordinary time for exercise as described below  but further vesting will not take place. If the employee's employment ceases due to dismissal from the employer's side  however  also vested options will lapse  unless the board of directors decides otherwise on a case-by-case basis.The stock options shall not constitute securities and shall not be able to be transferred or pledged. However  in the event of death  the rights constituted by vested stock options shall accrue to the beneficiaries of the holder of the stock options.The stock options shall be allotted without consideration.The holder can exercise allotted and vested stock options during the period from 1 September 2026 up to and including 30 September 2026.

The calculated subscription price shall be rounded off to nearest even hundredth of a SEK  whereupon SEK 0.005 will be rounded to SEK 0.01. The subscription price may not be set below the shares' par value. Upon subscription of shares  the part of the subscription price that exceeds the quotient value of the previous shares shall be allocated to the non-restricted share premium fund.A new share subscribed for by exercise of a warrant has a right to dividends as of the first record day for dividends following registration of the new share issue with the Companies Registration Office and after the share has been registered in the share register maintained by Euroclear Sweden AB.The purpose of the issuance  and deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  is to  within the framework of Employee Stock Option Program 2023/2026  secure delivery of shares to the participants of the program.The complete terms and conditions for the warrants series 2023/2026:1 are available on the Company's website two weeks prior to the general meeting  including conditions regarding re-calculation  in certain cases  of the subscription price and the number of shares a warrant entitles to.The board of directors or a person nominated by it  shall be authorized to make such minor adjustments as may be required in connection with registration of the resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and  if applicable  Euroclear Sweden AB.The board of directors further proposes that the extra general meeting resolves to approve that the Company or any other group company  may transfer warrants to the participants in the Employee Stock Option Program 2023/2026 without consideration in connection with exercise of the stock options in accordance with the terms set out in item 7a or in another way dispose of the warrants in order to be able to secure the Company's commitments and costs in relation to the Employee Stock Option Program 2023/2026.

The board of directors believes that it is in the interest of all shareholders that senior executives and other key individuals  which are deemed to be important for the group´s development in the US  have a long-term interest in a positive development of the company´s share price. Through the proposed program  a long-term ownership commitment is created  which is expected to stimulate an increased interest in the business and the company's performance in general.In order to secure the Company´s commitments according to Performance Share Program 2023/2026 and secure related costs  the board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves on a directed issue of warrants and approval of transfer of warrants in accordance with what appears in item 8a and 8b below.A presentation of other incentive programs  preparation of the proposal  costs for the programs and effects on key performance measures etc. are described below.Item 8a: Resolution to adopt a performance share programThe board of directors of the Company proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to adopt Performance Share Program 2023/2026 according to the following guidelines.Performance Share Program 2023/2026 shall include a maximum of 56 000 Performance Shares.Performance Shares that have vested will entitle to subscription for shares at a price corresponding to the quota value of the share provided that a performance target regarding the average annual share price development of the Biovica share (""CAGR"") during the program is achieved. For the performance target to be fulfilled the average annual CAGR need be at least 14 percent. At an average CAGR that meets or exceeds 14 percent  100 percent of the Performance Shares will entitle to subscription of shares to the quota value of the share. At an average CAGR that does not meet or exceed 14 percent  0 percent of the Performance Shares will entitle to subscription of shares to the quota value of the share. Average CAGR shall be measured by comparing the volume weighted average share price of the Biovica share during twenty (20) days of trading following the day of the annual general meeting 2023 with the volume weighted average share price of the Biovica share during the corresponding period in 2026.The number of shares that each participant shall be entitled to subscribe for under Performance Share Program 2023/2026 shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number.Provided that Performance Shares have vested and that the performance target has been achieved  each Performance Share entitles the holder to no earlier than three years after program start (1 June 2026) in accordance with the restrictions stated in this proposal and according to the company´s decision  either (a) acquire one (1) share at a price corresponding to the quota value of the share (the company´s current quota is SEK 0 06666666671267170 per share) or (b) obtain free of charge a warrant that entitles the subscription of one (1) share in the company to a subscription price corresponding to the quota value of the share.Performance Share Program 2023/2026 shall be offered to all current senior executives and other key employees in the US group up to and including 1 June 2023.Senior executives and other employees within the company and the group in the US will  within the framework of the Performance Share Program 2023/2026  be offered Performance Shares divided into three different categories as follows.A. Persons within the management  consisting of one (1) person  may be offered a maximum of 8 000 Performance Shares each and a maximum of 8 000 Performance Shares in total;B.

Oversubscription cannot take place. If any person within the above-mentioned categories does not subscribe for their full number of Performance Shares  such Performance Share may be granted to an employee within another category.The Company´s board of directors shall not be covered by the Performance Share program 2023/2026.Application to participate in Performance Share Program 2023/2026 must have been received by the company no later than 1 June 2022.Granted Performance Shares vests over three years as follows:a) 1/3 of the granted Performance Shares will vest on 1 June 2024.b) 2/3 of the granted Performance Shares will vest on a linear basis quarterly from 1 June 2024  through 1 June 2026.Vesting requires that the participant is still active within the group and that the employment has not been terminated their employment or consulting agreement as of the date when the respective vesting occurs. If a participant ceases to be an employee or terminates his/her employment/ consulting agreement with the group before a vesting date  the already vested Performance Shares may be exercised at the ordinary time for exercise as described below  but further vesting will not take place. If the employee's employment/consultant agreement ceases due to dismissal from the employer's side  however  also vested Performance Shares will lapse  unless the board of directors decides otherwise on a case-by-case basis.The holder of Performance Shares can exercise granted and vested Performance Shares to acquire shares after the outcome of the performance condition has been determined by the board  until 15 September 2026. The board shall have the right to extend the exercise period.The Performance Shares must not constitute securities and cannot be transferred or pledged. However  the rights according to vested Performance Shares may be transferred to the estate in the event of the participant´s death.Participation in the Performance Share Program 2023/2026 presupposes that such participation can legally take place  and that  according to the company´s assessment  such participation can take place with reasonable administrative costs and financial contributions.The Performance Shares shall be regulated in agreements with the respective participants. The board shall be responsible for the design and management of the Performance Share program 2023/2026 within the framework of the main conditions and guidelines stated above. The board has the right  within the framework of the agreement with respective participants  to make the reasonable changes and adjustments to the terms of Performance Shares that are deemed appropriate or expedient as a result of local labor law or tax law rules or administrative conditions. It can i.e.  mean that continued earning of Performance Shares may take place in certain cases where this would not otherwise have been the case. The board also has the right to advance vesting and the timing of exercise of Performance Shares in certain cases  such as in the event of a public takeover offer  certain ownership changes in the company  liquidation  merger and similar measures. Finally  the board has the right to  in extraordinary cases  limit the scope of or prematurely terminate Performance Share Program 2023/2026 in whole or in part.Item 8b: Resolution to issue warrants and approval of transfer of warrantsIn order to enable the delivery of B shares according to the Performance Share Program 2023/2026 and secure related costs (primarily social security contributions) the board of directors of the Company proposes that the extra general meeting resolves on a directed issue of warrants of series 2023/2026:3 and approval of the transfer of warrants of series 2023/2026:2.The board of directors proposes that the extra general meeting resolves to issue a maximum of 56 000 warrants  as a result of which the company's share capital may increase by a maximum of SEK 3 733.333336.The warrants shall entail the right to subscribe for new B shares in the company.For the issue  the following conditions shall apply:The right to subscribe for the warrants shall  with deviation from the shareholders' preferential right  accrue to the company and other group companies.The warrants are issued free of charge and must be subscribed on a special subscription list no later than 30 June 2023. The board have the right to extend the subscription period.Each warrant entitles the holder to subscribe for one new class B share in the Company during the period from registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office up to and including 15 September 2026  or the earlier day that follows from the terms of the warrants. The board have the right to extend the time for share subscription if participants are prevented from subscribing for shares at the end of the subscription period due to the EU's market abuse regulation.Each warrant gives the right to subscribe for a new B share in the company against cash payment according to a subscription price that corresponds to the share's quota value.A new share subscribed for by exercising a warrant carries the right to a dividend for the first time on the record date for the dividend that falls closest after the new shares have been registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and the shares have been entered in the share register maintained by Euroclear Sweden AB.The purpose of the issue and the deviation from the shareholders' preferential right is to ensure delivery of shares to participants in the program within the framework of the Performance Share Program 2023/2026.The full terms and conditions for the warrants are available in item 2c which means  among other things  that the subscription price and the number of shares that the warrant entitles to subscription may be recalculated in certain cases.The board of directors  or the person that the board of directors may appoint  shall be authorized to make minor adjustment necessary in connection with the registration of the resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office or  where applicable  Euroclear Sweden AB.The board of directors further proposes that the extra general meeting resolves to approve that the company or another group company may transfer warrants to participants in the Performance Share Program 2023/2026 free of charge in connection with the exercise of performance shares in accordance with the conditions in Item 2c or otherwise dispose of the warrants to secure the Company's commitments and costs due to the Performance Share Program 2023/2026.The board of directors shall not have the right to dispose the warrants for any other purpose than to secure the Company's commitments and costs in connection with the performance share program 2023/2026.Preparation of incentive programs etc. (it is noted that this is not a topic for resolution)Proposal on Employee Stock Option Program 2023/2026 and Performance Share Program 2023/2026 has been prepared by external advisors in consultation with the remuneration committee and the board of directors.Valuation and Costs and effects on key figuresEmployee Stock Option Program 2023/2026Costs related to Employee Stock Option Program 2023/2026 will be recognized in accordance with IFRS 2  which means that the stock options are expensed as personnel costs during the vesting period.Based on the assumption that 100 percent of the options in the Employee Stock Option Program 2023/2026 will be allotted and an annual employee turnover rate of 0 percent  meaning that 168 000 stock options will vest  the estimated total accounting salary costs for the options will amount to approximately SEK 355 000 during the time period 2023-2026  based on the actual value of the options at the time of calculation. The options do not have a market value since they are not transferable. However  the board of directors  with assistance of an independent valuator  has calculated a theoretical value of the options in accordance with the Black Scholes formula. The calculations have been based on a by the board of directors estimated share price of SEK 9 per share  a risk-free interest rate of 3.1 percent and an assumed volatility of 49 percent. In accordance with this valuation  the value of the options in the Employee Stock Option Program 2023/2026 is approximately SEK 2.11 per option. Limitations in the disposal rights have not been taken into consideration in the valuation.Upon a positive development of the share price  the Employee Stock Option Program 2023/2026 may entail costs in the form of social security contributions. The total costs for social security contributions will depend on the employment form of the participant  the number of options that will be vested and on the value of the benefit that the participant finally will receive  i.e. on the value of the options when exercised 2026  but also in which countries the participants are resident and what rates that apply for social security contributions in these countries. Based on the assumption that 168 000 options in Employee Stock Option Program 2023/2026 will be vested  an assumed share price of SEK 13.5 when the options are exercised and an assumed average social security rate of approximately 22 percent  the total costs for social security contributions will amount to approximately SEK 41 000.The Company's entire costs for social security contributions are proposed to be hedged through a directed issue of warrants in accordance with item 7d.The total cost for Employee Stock Option Program 2023/2026 will be distributed over the years 2023-2026.Given the above assumptions  including an assumed share price of 13.5 at the time of exercise of the options  and that the program had been introduced in 2021/2022 instead  it is calculated that the key figure earnings per share for full year 2021/2022 would have decreased from SEK -2 11 to SEK -2 12.It shall be noted that all calculations above are preliminary  based on assumptions and are only intended to provide an illustration of what costs Employee Stock Option Program 2023/2026 may entail. Actual costs may therefore deviate from what has been stated above.Performance Share Program 2023/2026Costs related to the Performance Share Program 2023/2026 will be reported in accordance with IFRS 2  which means that the Performance Shares shall be expensed as a personnel cost over the vesting period without affecting the company's cash flow.If performance share rights are exercised  Performance Share Program 2023/2026 will in addition entail costs in the form of social security contributions. The total costs for social security contributions depend partly on the participant's employment relationship  partly on how many performance share rights are earned  and partly on the value of the benefit that the participant ultimately receives  i.e. the value of the performance share rights upon exercise in 2026. Social security contributions will be expensed in the income statement during the vesting period. The company intends to hedge the entire exposure to social security contributions through an issue of warrants in the manner set out in the Board's proposal in accordance with item 8b  which may be exercised by a financial intermediary in connection with the exercise of the performance share rights. If the Company chooses to implement such hedging measures  the social security contributions will not affect the Company's cash flow.Based on the assumption that all 56 000 Performance Shares included in the Performance Share Program 2023/2026 are allotted  an assumed share price of SEK 14.6 when exercising the performance share rights and an assumed average percentage for social security contributions of approximately 22 percent  the total costs for the program  including social security contributions  are estimated to amount to SEK 443 000  which corresponds to approximately 1 percent of the Company's total annual salary costs for employees (including social security contributions) calculated on salary costs for the financial year 2022/2023.The total costs for the Performance Share Program 2023/2026 will be distributed over the years 2023-2026. As 1/3 of the Performance Shares are earned in the first year and 2/3 are earned over two years in quarterly items  the costs will be distributed unevenly over the period with emphasis at the beginning of this.

Photograph: Nick BradshawPaddy Power owner Flutter Entertainment cannot guarantee that its shares will continue to trade on the Irish Stock Exchange after it takes a secondary listing in New York.Shareholders have overwhelmingly backed the Wall Street move  mooted by the Irish gambling giant in February.Speaking after its annual general meeting in Dublin on Thursday  chairman Gary McGann said the group had “work to do” to allow it list in New York. These include preparing to meet US reporting requirements and overcoming complexities in dealing and settlement between the New York and Euronext Dublin markets. “That will take us to the year-end ” Mr McGann said.Asked if Flutter wanted to keep its Irish market listing  chief executive Peter Jackson responded “we cannot guarantee it”. However  he stressed that the group ideally wanted its shares to trade on all three markets.READ MOREFlutter would keep its primary listing in London and continue to work with Dublin Euronext  as the Irish market was now known  and New York  to work out the settlement difficulties  he said.The problem lies between Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation in the US and Euroclear in Europe  the companies that process share and other security transactions on the two markets.Why do some shareholders in the Republic's largest private residential landlord feel shortchanged? Listen | 40:06Mr McGann stressed that the group would remain Irish  pointing out that it was headquartered and tax domiciled in the Republic.Flutter  which grew from the merger of Irish bookie Paddy Power and British betting exchange  Betfair  has businesses in about 80 countries while the recently liberalised US is now its biggest market.Its main US business  FanDuel  is heading for profitability this year following almost half a decade of investment and development. The group believes the New York listing will help it attract more US investors anxious to cash in on FanDuel’s expansion.Mr McGann told shareholders on Thursday that Flutter calculated that the US sports betting market was worth about $40 billion (€36 billion) a year.Earlier Flutter announced that former Kellogg chief executive  John Bryant  would succeed Mr McGann as chairman in September.Well-known in corporate America  Mr Bryant is on the board of Coca Cola European Partners  department store chain Macy’s  where his tenure ends this month  caterer Compass Group and packager Ball Corporation. Previously Mr Bryant was chief executive and then executive chairman of cereal maker  Kellogg Company.He said he looked forward to working with Mr Jackson and Flutter’s management to grow the business.Mr McGann said it had been a privilege to chair Flutter as it developed. “The best is yet to come ” he told shareholders. Mr Jackson thanked Mr McGann and predicted that Mr Bryant’s experience would be “invaluable” as Flutter continued growing.,negative,0.0,0.04,0.96,mixed,0.46,0.11,0.44,True,English,"['Irish listing', 'Flutter', 'future', 'Flutter chief executive Peter Jackson', 'largest private residential landlord', 'Coca Cola European Partners', 'department store chain Macy', 'former Kellogg chief executive', 'Irish bookie Paddy Power', 'US sports betting market', 'New York stock markets', 'Paddy Power owner', 'Irish Stock Exchange', 'British betting exchange', 'Irish gambling giant', 'annual general meeting', 'other security transactions', 'half a decade', 'packager Ball Corporation', 'US reporting requirements', 'Irish market listing', 'Wall Street move', 'New York listing', 'main US business', 'caterer Compass Group', 'chairman Gary McGann', 'Euronext Dublin markets', 'executive chairman', 'Mr Jackson', 'Kellogg Company', 'three markets', 'two markets', 'biggest market', 'Clearing Corporation', 'secondary listing', 'primary listing', 'US investors', 'Mr McGann', 'Nick Bradshaw', 'overcoming complexities', 'Depository Trust', 'John Bryant', 'corporate America', 'Mr Bryant', 'cereal maker', 'Flutter Entertainment', 'settlement difficulties', 'Photograph', 'shares', 'Shareholders', 'February', 'Thursday', 'work', 'dealing', 'year-end', 'READ', 'London', 'problem', 'Euroclear', 'companies', 'Republic', 'Listen', 'merger', 'Betfair', 'businesses', '80 countries', 'FanDuel', 'profitability', 'investment', 'development', 'expansion', 'September', 'board', 'tenure', 'management', 'privilege', 'experience']",2023-04-27,2023-04-28,irishtimes.com

Rates ADV was up 16.4% driven by record activity in swaps/swaptions ≥ 1-year and < 1-year and record retail U.S. government bonds. Credit – Revenues of $89.0 million in the first quarter of 2023 increased 3.1% compared to prior year period (4.7% increase on a constant currency basis). While credit ADV was down 2.8% from prior year period  we reported record ADV in fully electronic U.S. High Grade credit. On the protocol front  we achieved record ADV across global portfolio trading  U.S. credit Tradeweb AllTrade®  and U.S. credit RFQ  in the quarter. Tradeweb's share of fully electronic TRACE volume for U.S. High Grade was 13.3% compared with 12.0% in the prior year period (+136 bps) and U.S. High Yield was 6.1% compared with 7.1% in the prior year period (-102 bps). Equities – Revenues of $26.2 million in the first quarter of 2023 decreased 1.3% compared to prior year period (1.2% increase on a constant currency basis). While equities ADV was down 8.9% from prior year period  we reported record ADV in equity convertibles/swaps/options in the quarter. Strong U.S. institutional ETF activity  driven by increased adoption of Tradeweb's RFQ protocol  was more than offset by declines in wholesale activity. European volumes reflected a decline in overall market volumes. Money Markets – Revenues of $14.8 million in the first quarter of 2023 increased 28.5% compared to prior year period (30.3% increase on a constant currency basis). Money Markets ADV was up 18.9% led by record activity in repurchase agreements  record ADV in retail money markets and continued client adoption of Tradeweb's electronic trading solutions. Market Data – Revenues of $22.4 million in the first quarter of 2023 increased 5.0% compared to prior year period (6.5% on a constant currency basis). The increase was derived primarily from increased proprietary third party market data revenue. Other – Revenues of $6.3 million in the first quarter of 2023 increased 16.3% compared to prior year period (the same percentage increase on a constant currency basis). The increase was driven primarily from an increase in revenue from software development and implementation projects performed on behalf of certain clients. Operating Expenses of $206.7 million in the first quarter of 2023 increased 3.4% compared to $199.9 million in the prior year period due to higher technology and communications expenses  higher general and administrative expenses and higher professional fee expenses. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in expenses related to employee compensation and benefits  primarily due to decreases in incentive compensation. Adjusted Expenses of $170.8 million increased 4.5% (6.4% increase on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year period due to: higher professional fees  higher technology and communications expenses; higher general and administrative expenses and higher depreciation and amortization.

As a result of certain reorganization transactions (the “Reorganization Transactions”) completed in connection with the IPO  on April 4  2019  Tradeweb Markets Inc. became a holding company whose only material assets consist of its equity interest in Tradeweb Markets LLC (“TWM LLC”) and related deferred tax assets. As the sole manager of TWM LLC  Tradeweb Markets Inc. operates and controls all of the business and affairs of TWM LLC and  through TWM LLC and its subsidiaries  conducts its business. As a result of this control  and because Tradeweb Markets Inc. has a substantial financial interest in TWM LLC  Tradeweb Markets Inc. consolidates the financial results of TWM LLC and its subsidiaries. Numerical figures included in this release have been subject to rounding adjustments and as a result totals may not be the arithmetic aggregation of the amounts that precede them and figures expressed as percentages may not total 100%. Please refer to the Company's previously filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Annual Report on Form 10-K for capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein. UNAUDITED INTERIM RESULTS The interim financial results presented herein for the three months ended March 31  2023 and 2022 are unaudited.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Statements related to  among other things  our guidance  including full-year 2023 guidance  future performance  the industry and markets in which we operate  our expectations  beliefs  plans  strategies  objectives  prospects and assumptions and future events are forward-looking statements. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations  assumptions  estimates and projections. While we believe these expectations  assumptions  estimates and projections are reasonable  such forward-looking statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties  many of which are beyond our control. These and other important factors  including those discussed under the heading “Risk Factors” in the documents of Tradeweb Markets Inc. on file with or furnished to the SEC  may cause our actual results  performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties  you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This release contains “non-GAAP financial measures ” including Adjusted EBITDA  Adjusted EBITDA margin  Adjusted EBIT  Adjusted EBIT margin  Adjusted Net Income  Adjusted Net Income per diluted share (""Adjusted Diluted EPS"")  Adjusted Expenses  Free Cash Flow and constant currency change  which are supplemental financial measures that are not calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. We make use of non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating our past results and future prospects. We present these non-GAAP financial measures because we believe they assist investors and analysts in comparing our operating performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. Management and our board of directors use Adjusted EBITDA  Adjusted EBITDA margin  Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBIT margin to assess our financial performance and believe they are helpful in highlighting trends in our core operating performance  while other measures can differ significantly depending on long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure  the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and capital investments. Further  our executive incentive compensation is based in part on components of Adjusted EBITDA. We use Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS as supplemental metrics to evaluate our business performance in a way that also considers our ability to generate profit without the impact of certain items. Each of the normal recurring adjustments and other adjustments included in Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS help to provide management with a measure of our operating performance over time by removing items that are not related to day-to-day operations or are non-cash expenses. We use Adjusted Expenses as a supplemental metric to evaluate our underlying operating performance over time by removing items that are not related to day-to-day operations or are non-cash expenses. We use Free Cash Flow to assess our liquidity in a way that considers the amount of cash generated from our core operations after non-acquisition related expenditures for capitalized software development costs and furniture  equipment and leasehold improvements. We present certain changes on a “constant currency” basis. Since our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars  we must translate non-U.S. dollar revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars. Constant currency change  which is a non-GAAP financial measure  is defined as change excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations. Constant currency information is calculated by translating the current period and prior period’s results using the annual average exchange rates for the prior period. We use constant currency change as a supplemental metric to evaluate our underlying performance between periods by removing the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. We present certain constant currency change information because we believe it provides investors and analysts a useful comparison of our results and trends between periods. This information should be considered in addition to  not as a substitute for  results reported in accordance with GAAP. See the attached schedules for reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures contained in this release to their most comparable GAAP financial measure. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools  and you should not consider these non-GAAP financial measures in isolation or as alternatives to net income attributable to Tradeweb Markets Inc.  net income  net income margin  earnings per share  operating income  operating expenses  cash flow from operating activities or any other financial measure prepared or derived in accordance with GAAP. You are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment included in the reconciliations. In addition  in evaluating Adjusted EBITDA  Adjusted EBITDA margin  Adjusted EBIT  Adjusted EBIT margin  Adjusted EBT  Adjusted Net Income  Adjusted Diluted EPS  Adjusted Expenses and Free Cash Flow  you should be aware that in the future  we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures. Our presentation of non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. In addition  the non-GAAP financial measures contained in this release may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies in our industry or across different industries. MARKET AND INDUSTRY DATA This release includes estimates regarding market and industry data that we prepared based on our management’s knowledge and experience in the markets in which we operate  together with information obtained from various sources  including publicly available information  industry reports and publications  surveys  our clients  trade and business organizations and other contacts in the markets in which we operate.

In addition  a new section is proposed  § 11  which authorizes the Board of Directors to resolve that persons not being shareholders shall be allowed to attend general meetings.Following the insertion of a new section  a renumbering of sections is proposed  whereby the previous § 11 becomes § 12 and so on.Current wording Proposed wording 4 § Share capital and number of sharesThe share capital shall be not less than SEK 710 000 and not morethan SEK 2 840 000. The number of shares shall be not less than17 750 000 and not more than 71 000 000./…/ 4 § Share capital and number of sharesThe share capital shall be not less than SEK 1 000 000 and not morethan SEK 4 000 000.

Such share issue resolution may be carried out with or without deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights and with or without provisions for contribution in kind  set-off or other conditions. The authorization may only be utilized to such extent that the number of shares issued by virtue of the authorization  or the number of shares created in connection with exercise of warrants or conversion of convertibles  together with any ordinary shares transferred by virtue of the authorization under item 19 below (provided that the annual general meeting resolves in accordance with the proposal)  in aggregate does not exceed 20 percent of the total number of ordinary shares issued at the time of the general meeting's resolution on the proposed authorization  calculated after full exercise of the hereby proposed authorization.The purpose of the authorization is to increase the financial flexibility of the company and the general flexibility of the Board of Directors. Should the Board of Directors resolve on an issue with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  the reason for this shall be to finance an acquisition of operations  to procure capital to finance the development of projects  repayments of loans or to commercialize the company' s products. Upon such deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  the new issue shall be made at market terms and conditions.The CEO shall be authorized to make such minor adjustments to this resolution that may be necessary in connection with the registration thereof.Item 19 – Resolution to authorize the Board of Directors to resolve on transfer of own ordinary sharesIn 2022  Calliditas Therapeutics had a so called At-The-Market program (""ATM Program"") in place  directed towards the US market. In order to facilitate for the implementation of the ATM program  the annual general meeting 2022 adopted resolutions whereby  among other things  a new class of shares (C-shares) was introduced in the articles of association and the Board of Directors was authorized to resolve on the issue  repurchase and transfer of 5 908 019 C-shares after conversion to ordinary shares. On 20 June 2022  the board of directors resolved by virtue of the authorizations to issue and repurchase 5 908 019 C-shares as well as to convert the C-shares to ordinary shares  which the company has held in treasury since. The company does not intend to carry forward with the ATM program  meaning that the program will be terminated without any of the 5 908 019 ordinary shares being exercized  and as a complement to the proposal to authorize the Board of Directors to resolve on issue of new shares  warrants and/or convertibles in accordance with item 18 above  the Board of Directors therefore proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to authorize the Board of Directors to resolve on transfer of own ordinary shares in accordance with this item 19.The Board of Directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to authorize the Board of Directors  for the period up until the next annual general meeting  on one or several occasions  to resolve on transfer (sell) of own ordinary shares. Transfers may be carried outside Nasdaq Stockholm at a price with or without deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  against cash payment or against payment through set-off or in kind  or on other conditions. Upon such transfers  the price shall be established so that it is not below market price. Transfers of own ordinary shares pursuant to this item may be made by a maximum of 5 908 018 ordinary shares held by the company at the time of this notice (or the lower number of own ordinary shares held by the company at any given time)  provided that the total number of shares transferred  together with shares issued or shares that may be created in connection with the exercise of warrants or conversion of convertibles issued by virtue of the authorization under item 18 above (provided that the annual general meeting resolves in accordance with the proposal)  in aggregate does not exceed 20 percent of the total number of ordinary shares issued at the time of the general meeting's resolution on the proposed authorization  calculated after full exercise of the proposed authorization under item 18.The purpose of the authorization is to finance an acquisition of operations  to procure capital to finance the development of projects  repayment of loans or to commercialize the company' s products.Item 20 – Resolution  in order to adopt a long-term performance-based incentive program for members of the Board of Directors  on:Linc AB and Stiftelsen Industrifonden which  as of the date of this notice  together represents 17 percent of the outstanding shares and votes in Calliditas Therapeutics  (the ""Main Shareholders"") proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to implement a long-term performance-based incentive program for members of the Board of Directors of Calliditas Therapeutics AB (""Board LTIP 2023"") in accordance with items 20a – 20b below. The resolutions under items 20a – 20b below are proposed to be conditional upon each other. Should the majority requirement for item 20b below not be met  the Main Shareholders propose that Calliditas Therapeutics shall be able to enter into an equity swap agreement with a third party in accordance with item 20c below and resolutions under items 20a and 20c shall then be conditional upon each other.Board LTIP 2023 is a program under which the participants will be granted  free of charge  share awards subject to performance vesting (""Share Awards"") that entitle to shares in Calliditas Therapeutics to be calculated in accordance with the principles stipulated below  however not more than 50 000 shares. In order to ensure the delivery of shares under Board LTIP 2023 and Board LTIP 2022 (as defined below)  not more than 90 706 warrants (50 000 warrants for Board LTIP 2023 and 40 706 warrants for Board LTIP 2022) can be issued in accordance with item 20b below.20a – Adoption of a long-term performance-based incentive program for members of the Board of DirectorsThe rationale for the proposalBoard LTIP 2023 is intended for members of the Board of Directors in Calliditas Therapeutics. The Main Shareholders believe that an equity-based incentive program is a central part of an attractive and competitive remuneration package in order to attract  retain and motivate internationally competent members of the Board of Directors  and to incentivise the participants on delivering exceptional performance which contributes to value creation for all shareholders. Board LTIP 2023 is adapted to the current position and needs of Calliditas Therapeutics. The Main Shareholders are of the opinion that Board LTIP 2023 will increase and strengthen the participants' dedication to Calliditas Therapeutics' operations  improve company loyalty and be beneficial to both the shareholders and Calliditas Therapeutics.Conditions for Share AwardsThe following conditions shall apply for the Share Awards.The Share Awards shall be granted free of charge to the participants as soon as practicable after the annual general meeting. The Share Awards shall vest gradually over approximately three years  corresponding to three terms up to the date of  whichever is earliest  (i) the annual general meeting 2026 or (ii) 1 July 2026 (the ""Vesting Date"")  where each term equals the period from one annual general meeting up until the day falling immediately prior to the next annual general meeting or the Vesting Date  as applicable (each such period a ""Term""). The Share Awards shall vest with 1/3 at the end of each Term  provided that the participant is still a Board member of Calliditas Therapeutics on the said date. In addition to the vesting conditions just stated  the Share Awards are subject to performance vesting based on the development of the Calliditas Therapeutics share price  in accordance with the vesting conditions below. The Share Awards are subject to performance vesting based on the development of the Calliditas Therapeutics share price over the period from the date the Share Awards are allocated (""Grant Date"") up to and including the day before the Vesting Date. The development of the share price will be measured based on the volume-weighted average price of the company's share on Nasdaq Stockholm for the 10 trading days immediately preceding the Grant Date and the 10 trading days immediately preceding the Vesting Date  respectively. In the event Calliditas Therapeutics' share price has increased by more than 60 percent  100 percent of the Share Awards shall vest  and should the share price have increased by 20 percent  33 percent of such Share Awards shall vest. In the event of an increase of the share price of between 20 and 60 percent  vesting of the Share Awards will occur linearly. Should the increase of the share price be less than 20 percent  vesting will not occur at all. The earliest point in time at which shares may be obtained from vested Share Awards shall be as soon as possible after the Vesting Date and once an assessment of the performance criteria has been made. Each vested Share Award entitles the holder to receive one share in Calliditas Therapeutics without any compensation being payable provided that the holder is still a Board member of Calliditas Therapeutics at the relevant time of vesting with the exception of certain customary ""good leaver""-situations (death and permanent incapacity to complete the assignment due to illness or accident) and this shall also apply during the first year up until the day of the annual general meeting 2024. The number of Share Awards will be re-calculated in the event that changes occur in Calliditas Therapeutics' equity capital structure  such as a bonus issue  merger  rights issue  share split or reverse share split  reduction of the share capital or similar measures. The Share Awards cannot be transferred and may not be pledged. The Share Awards can be granted by the parent company as well as any other company within the Calliditas Therapeutics group. In the event of a public take-over offer  asset sale  liquidation  merger or any other such transaction affecting Calliditas Therapeutics  the Share Awards will vest in their entirety upon completion of such transaction. The Share Awards shall otherwise be subject to the terms set forth in the separate agreements with the participants and the detailed terms for Board LTIP 2023.AllocationThe number of Share Awards that shall be granted to each participant shall equal the below amount for the respective participant divided by the volume-weighted average price of the Calliditas Therapeutics share on Nasdaq Stockholm for the 10 trading days preceding the Grant Date.The Share Awards under Board LTIP 2023 shall be awarded in accordance with the following:Share Awards calculated based on SEK 1 300 000 to the chairman of the Board of Directors; andShare Awards calculated based on SEK 500 000 to each of Hilde Furberg  Diane Parks  Henrik Stenqvist  Elisabeth Björk and Fred Driscoll.In any event  Board LTIP 2023 will comprise a total number of Share Awards which  if all Share Awards are vested in accordance with the vesting conditions above  can entitle to not more than 50 000 shares in Calliditas Therapeutics.Preparation of the proposalBoard LTIP 2023 has been prepared by the Main Shareholders and has been structured based on an evaluation of prior incentive programs and market practice for comparable European (including Swedish) and American listed companies.DilutionAssuming a volume-weighted average price of the Calliditas Therapeutics share on Nasdaq Stockholm for the 10 trading days preceding the Grant Date of SEK 125  Board LTIP 2023 will comprise not more than 30 400 shares in total  which corresponds to a dilution of approximately 0.1 percent on a fully diluted basis. Taking into account also the shares which may be issued pursuant to previously implemented incentive programs in the company  the maximum dilution amounts to 7.2 percent on a fully diluted basis. Taking into account also the shares which may be issued pursuant to previously implemented incentive programs in the company as well as the incentive program for the company's management and key personnel proposed to the annual general meeting 2023  the maximum dilution amounts to 10.0 percent on a fully diluted basis.Information about Calliditas Therapeutics' existing incentive programs can be found in Calliditas Therapeutics' annual report for 2022  note 10  which is available on the company's website  www.calliditas.se/en/.Scope and costs of the programBoard LTIP 2023 will be accounted for in accordance with ""IFRS 2 – Share-based payments"". IFRS 2 stipulates that the Share Awards shall be expensed as personnel costs over the vesting period and will be accounted for directly against equity. Personnel costs in accordance with IFRS 2 do not affect the company's cash flow. Social security costs will be expensed in the income statement during the vesting period.Assuming a volume-weighted average price of the Calliditas Therapeutics share on Nasdaq Stockholm for the 10 trading days preceding the Grant Date of SEK 125  the annual cost for the Board LTIP 2023  according to IFRS 2  is estimated at approximately SEK 0.7 million before tax. The estimated IFRS 2 cost has been calculated with a Monte Carlo simulation. The annual cost for social security contributions is estimated at SEK 0.4 million  based on an annual increase in the share price of 10 percent  the aforementioned assumptions and a social security tax rate of 31.42 percent. The total annual cost for Board LTIP 2023 during the term of the program  including costs according to IFRS 2 and social security charges  is therefore estimated to approximately SEK 1.1 million.The total cost of the Board LTIP 2023  including all costs referred to above and social security charges  is estimated to amount to approximately SEK 3.3 million under the above assumptions.Delivery of shares under Board LTIP 2023In order to ensure the delivery of shares under Board LTIP 2023  the Main Shareholders propose that the annual general meeting resolves to issue warrants in accordance with item 20b below.20b – Issue of warrantsIn order to ensure the delivery of shares under (i) Board LTIP 2023 and (ii) the long-term performance-based incentive program for members of the Board of Directors adopted by the annual general meeting 2022 (the ""Board LTIP 2022"")  the Main Shareholders propose that the annual general meeting resolves to issue not more than 90 706 warrants (50 000 warrants for Board LTIP 2023 and 40 706 warrants for Board LTIP 2022)  whereby the company's share capital can increase by not more than SEK 3 628 24 in accordance with the following:The right to subscribe for the warrants shall  with deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights  only vest with Nefecon AB  a wholly owned subsidiary of Calliditas Therapeutics. The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights is the implementation of Board LTIP 2023 and to ensure the delivery of shares under Board LTIP 2022. Nefecon AB shall be entitled to transfer the warrants to participants of Board LTIP 2023 and Board LTIP 2022  respectively  or a financial intermediary in connection with the exercise of Share Awards (including the corresponding share awards exercised under Board LTIP 2022). The warrants shall be issued free of charge and shall be subscribed for on a subscription list no later than 1 July 2023. The Board of Directors may extend the subscription period. The detailed terms of the warrants are set out in the complete proposal which is kept available to the shareholders. The exercise price for subscription for shares based on the warrants shall correspond to the share's quota value. The CEO shall be authorized to make such minor adjustments that may be necessary in connection with the registration of the new issue. Notification of subscription of shares by the exercise of Warrants can be made from and including the day of registration of the Warrants with the Swedish Companies Registration Office up until and including 31 December 2026. Shares which are issued following subscription shall entitle to participation in the distribution of profits for the first time on the nearest record date occurring after the subscription has been exercised.20c – Equity swap agreement with a third partyShould the majority requirement for item 20b above not be met  the Main Shareholders propose that the annual general meeting resolves that Board LTIP 2023 shall instead be hedged so that Calliditas Therapeutics can enter into an equity swap agreement with a third party on terms in accordance with market practice  whereby the third party in its own name shall be entitled to acquire and transfer shares of Calliditas Therapeutics to the participants.Item 21 – Resolution  in order to adopt a long-term incentive program for the company's management and key personnel  on:The Board of Directors of Calliditas Therapeutics proposes the introduction of a long-term incentive program for the company's management and key personnel (including employees and consultants) in accordance with the following.The Board of Directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to implement a long-term incentive program for management and key personnel (including employees and consultants) in Calliditas Therapeutics (""ESOP 2023"") in accordance with items 21a – 21b below.The resolutions under items 21a – 21b below are proposed to be conditional upon each other. Should the majority requirement for item 21b below not be met  the Board of Directors proposes that Calliditas Therapeutics shall be able to enter into an equity swap agreement with a third party in accordance with item 21c below and resolutions under items 21a and 21c shall then be conditional upon each other.ESOP 2023 is a program under which the participants will be granted  free of charge  stock options to acquire shares in Calliditas Therapeutics (""Options"")  subject to vesting over a three-year period in accordance with the below. The Board of Directors proposes that a maximum of 2 000 000 Options are allocated to the participants.21a – Adoption of a long-term incentive program for the company's management and key personnelThe rationale for the proposalESOP 2023 is intended for members of management and key personnel (including employees and consultants) in Calliditas Therapeutics. The Board of Directors of Calliditas Therapeutics believes that an equity-based incentive program in the form of stock options is a central part of an attractive and competitive remuneration package in order to attract  retain and motivate competent members of management and key personnel (including employees and consultants) in Calliditas Therapeutics  and to focus the participants on delivering exceptional performance which contributes to value creation for all shareholders.The proposed program is key for the company's ability to attract  retain and motivate competent key persons in the United States as well as in Europe in the company's operations and commercial functions scaling up the market launch of TARPEYO in the United States and the development of the company's pipeline assets. During the fourth quarter of 2021  the company received accelerated approval in the United States and since January 2022  the company commercializes TARPEYO in the United States. When recruiting and maintaining experienced commercial personnel in the United States and other key employees in the United States and Europe  it is important for Calliditas Therapeutics to be able to offer attractive compensation terms. A competitive equity-based incentive program is a key component in order to be able to attract and retain highly skilled and experienced individuals across clinical  manufacturing and regulatory areast  as well as relevant competencies related to Calliditas Therapeutics´ commercialization of TARPEYO in the United States.The Board of Directors of Calliditas Therapeutics believes that ESOP 2023 will fortify the alignment of the interests of the participants and the interests of the shareholders. ESOP 2023 is adapted to the current position and needs of Calliditas Therapeutics. The Board of Directors is of the opinion that ESOP 2023 will increase and strengthen the participants' dedication to Calliditas Therapeutics' operations  improve company loyalty and that ESOP 2023 will be beneficial to both the shareholders and Calliditas Therapeutics.Conditions for OptionsThe following conditions shall apply for the Options.The Options shall be granted free of charge to the participants.The Board of Directors shall resolve upon the allocation of Options between the date of the annual general meeting 2023 and the date of the annual general meeting 2024 (with each respective granting falling on a "" Grant Date "").Each Option entitles the holder to acquire one share in Calliditas Therapeutics for a pre-determined exercise price. The exercise price will correspond to 115 percent of the volume weighted average price of the Calliditas Therapeutics share on Nasdaq Stockholm during the ten trading days preceding the Grant Date.The Options shall vest over a three-year period  with 20 percent on the first anniversary of the Grant Date  with an annual vesting of 40 percent during the second year after the Grant Date  and with an annual vesting of 40 percent during the third year after the Grant Date  and thereafter be exercisable  provided that the holder  with certain exceptions  still is employed by Calliditas Therapeutics (or  in the case of consultants  still provides services to Calliditas Therapeutics).Following the expiry of the vesting period  the Options may be exercised during a one-year period.The number of Options shall be subject to customary re-calculation  for example in the event that changes occur in Calliditas Therapeutics' equity capital structure  such as a bonus issue  merger  rights issue  share split or reverse share split  reduction of the share capital or similar measures.The Options are non-transferable and may not be pledged.The Options may be granted by the parent company as well as any other company within the Calliditas Therapeutics group.In the event of a public take-over offer  asset sale  liquidation  merger or any other such transaction affecting Calliditas Therapeutics  the Options will vest in their entirety following the completion of a change of control.AllocationThe right to receive Options shall accrue to up to 200 employees or consultants of the company. The Board of Directors may grant Options  on one or several occasions  between the date of the annual general meeting 2023 and the date of the annual general meeting 2024. The maximum number of Options that may be allocated to the participants under ESOP 2023 is 2 000 000.The maximum allocation per individual in each category shall be 300 000 Options for Category 1 (CEO)  250 000 Options for Category 2 (Management) and 100 000 Options for Category 3 (Other key personnel and consultants).Preparation  administration and the right to amend the terms of the OptionsThe Board of Directors is responsible for preparing the detailed terms and conditions of ESOP 2023  in accordance with the above-mentioned terms and guidelines. To this end  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to make adjustments to meet foreign regulations or market conditions  including resolving on cash or other settlement if deemed favorable for Calliditas Therapeutics based on foreign tax regulations. The Board of Directors may also make other adjustments if significant changes in Calliditas Therapeutics or its environment would result in a situation where the adopted terms and conditions of ESOP 2023 no longer serve their purpose.Preparation of the proposalESOP 2023 has been initiated by the Board of Directors of Calliditas Therapeutics and has been structured based on an evaluation of prior incentive programs and market practice for comparable European (including Swedish) and American listed companies. ESOP 2023 has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee and reviewed by the Board of Directors.DilutionSubject to certain recalculation conditions  the maximum number of shares that may be issued under ESOP 2023 is 2 000 000 which corresponds to a dilution of approximately 3.3 percent on a fully diluted basis. Taking into account also the shares which may be issued pursuant to already allocated warrants under the company's outstanding incentive programs  the maximum dilution amounts to approximately 10.0 percent on a fully diluted basis.Information about Calliditas Therapeutics' existing incentive programs can be found on Calliditas Therapeutics' website  www.calliditas.se/en/  under ""Remuneration"" as well as in the company's annual report.Scope and costs of the programESOP 2023 will be accounted for in accordance with ""IFRS 2 – Share-based payments"". IFRS 2 stipulates that the Options shall be expensed as personnel costs over the vesting period. Personnel costs in accordance with IFRS 2 do not affect the company's cash flow. Social security costs will be expensed in the income statement according to UFR 7 during the vesting period.Assuming a share price at the time of allocation of Options of SEK 125  an annual increase in the share price of 10 percent and that all Options are allocated up-front under the assumptions set out under ""Dilution"" above  the average annual cost for Calliditas Therapeutics according to IFRS 2 is estimated to approximately SEK 22.0 million per year before tax. The average annual social security costs over the vesting period are estimated to approximately a total of SEK 6.9 million  based on the above assumptions  that all Options are fully vested  a vesting period for all Options of three years and social security costs of 31.42 percent. It is envisaged that the social security costs associated with ESOP 2023 will be covered by the cash received from the participants at exercise of Options. If necessary  social security costs will be covered by hedging measures through the issue of warrants (see item 21b below) which would be exercised by a financial intermediary in connection with the exercise of the Options. In either case  the social security costs associated with ESOP 2023 will be fully covered and will hence not affect the company's cash flow.The total cost of ESOP 2023  including all social security costs  is estimated to amount to approximately SEK 86.7 million under the above assumptions.Delivery of shares under ESOP 2023In order to ensure the delivery of shares under ESOP 2023 and if necessary for hedging of social security costs  the Board of Directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to issue and use warrants in accordance with item 21b below.21b – Issue of warrantsIn order to ensure the delivery of shares under ESOP 2023  and  if necessary  for hedging of social security costs  the Board of Directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to issue not more than 2 000 000 warrants (which includes warrants to potentially hedge social security costs)  whereby the company's share capital could be increased by not more than SEK 80 000.The right to subscribe for the warrants shall  with deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights  only be granted Nefecon AB  a wholly owned subsidiary of Calliditas Therapeutics. The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights is the implementation of ESOP 2023. Nefecon AB shall be entitled to transfer the warrants to participants or a financial intermediary in connection with exercise.The warrants shall be issued free of charge. The exercise price for subscription for shares based on the warrants shall correspond to the share's quota value.The full terms and conditions for the warrants are presented in the complete proposal which is kept available to the shareholders in accordance with the below.21c – Equity swap agreement with a third partyShould the majority requirement for item 21b above not be met  the Board of Directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves that ESOP 2023 instead shall be hedged through an equity swap agreement with a third party on terms in accordance with market practice  whereby the third party in its own name shall be entitled to acquire and transfer shares of Calliditas Therapeutics to the participants.Majority rulesThe implementation of the Board of Directors' proposals under items 17  18 and 19 are subject to the approval at the annual general meeting with at least two thirds (2/3) of both the votes cast and of the shares represented at the meeting.

This figure totalled 821 million euros last year ,"Euroclear earns 734 mln euros in interest on frozen Russian assets in Q1MOSCOW. April 28 (Interfax) - Euroclear earned 734 million euros in interest income on investment of blocked Russian assets in the first quarter of 2023  the international depository reported.This figure totalled 821 million euros last year  including 110 million euros in the first half of 2022.Euroclear said its board expects interest income to continue to grow as blocked payments and redemptions continue to accumulate  albeit at a slower pace during 2023.Euroclear also ""notes that analysis is being undertaken by the European Commission to consider the potential generation of resources to support Ukraine from reinvestment of immobilised Russian assets.""Euroclear also reaffirmed that it would not distribute any profits related to the frozen Russian assets until the situation becomes clearer.Relations between European central depositories Euroclear and Clearstream and Russia's National Settlement Depository (NSD) were essentially cut off almost immediately after the start of the military operation in Ukraine last year. At the time  Russia  responding to tough sanctions  imposed currency and capital restrictions  while the European settlement and clearing systems closed ruble ""bridges"" and the option of settlements in rubles. The NSD  a division of the Moscow Exchange Group  imposed restrictions on transactions on Euroclear and Clearstream accounts at the beginning of March 2022 on the recommendation of the Central Bank of Russia (CBR).At the beginning of June 2022  the European Union imposed sanctions on the NSD  leading to its accounts being blocked at Euroclear and Clearstream. Russian investors had about 5.7 trillion rubles in assets blocked in foreign infrastructure as of the end of November  the CBR estimated.The European Commission issued clarifications in early October under which the authorities of some EU members could allow transactions necessary to close contracts and agreements entered into prior to the imposition of sanctions against the NSD on June 3 until January 7  2023.

Our diversified and robust business model continues to serve our stakeholders well  enabling further investment in our client proposition and business resilience as we implement the group's growth strategy.""Financial summaryEuroclear delivered another record financial performance in Q1 2023.Euroclear Holding (€ m) Q1 2023 Russian sanctions impacts Q1 2023 Underlying Underlyingvs 2022 Operating income 1 380 729 651 220 51 % Business income 409 -5 414 7 2 % Interest  banking & other income 971 734 237 213 871 % Operating expenses -315 -9 -307 -48 -19 % Operating profit before Impairment 1 065 720 344 171 99 % Impairment -2 -1 -1 -2 Pre tax profit 1 063 720 343 170 98 % Tax -267 -180 -87 -45 -107 % Net profit 796 540 256 125 95 % EPS 252.8 81.4 Business income operating margin 22.9 % 25.9 % EBITDA margin (EBITDA/oper.income) 79.1 % 57.0 %In total  Q1 2023 net profit increased to EUR 796 million  benefitting from the continued delivery on the group's strategy and its resilient business model  and the impact of Russian sanctions which contributed materially to the financial results.Further details on the implications of the Russian sanctions are included in a dedicated section later in the release.Underlying resultsUnderlying Q1 operating income rose 51% to a record EUR 651 million.Most of the group's operating income came from products and services that generated fees. Business income improved through the quarter to reach a record EUR 414 million  an increase of 2% year-on-year.The Euroclear group's business model provides a hedge against market volatility. When equity markets are lower  the impact is mitigated by the group's diversified and subscription-like business model  and we benefit in a similar vein when bond markets are weaker  as approximately three quarters of the group's business income is decoupled from financial market valuations. Such that  in the recent market environment  when both equity valuations and transaction volumes have been low  any potential impact to us has been mitigated by those operating entities which have a greater relative weighting to the bond markets  which saw business income grow.Over a three-year period  underlying business income has grown 9% CAGR  reflecting the robust growth delivered by the strategy through volatile financial market conditions.Since last year  the interest rate environment has changed dramatically. This has resulted in a large increase in interest earnings due to rising interest rates on cash balances. On an underlying basis  Q1 2023 interest  banking and other income increased by 871% to EUR 237 million because of rising interest rates.Euroclear is investing in its strategy  leading to underlying operating expenses increasing to EUR 307 million  up 19% compared to the prior year.Approximately 10% of the increase in underlying operating expenses is due to inflation on costs  with the remainder reflecting continued investments in its technology and service offering  as well as one-off projects. The investments in Euroclear's technology aim at enhancing Euroclear's client proposition  business resilience  and to increase efficiency through standardisation and modernisation.Euroclear continues to expect expenditure to remain above its 'through-the-cycle' target of 4-6% p.a. throughout 2023  due to accelerating investment in both its strategy and the resilience of the business  coupled with continued inflationary pressures on the cost base. Excluding the impact of inflation and one-off expenditures  Euroclear's Q1 expense profile is broadly in line with the top end of the through-the-cycle range.Nevertheless  profitability has continued to rise  as expected  as inflation headwinds have been more than offset by higher net interest income from subsequent rate increases. The group's underlying EBITDA margin was 57% in the first quarter  a level which is amongst the industry leaders in the financial market infrastructure sector.On an underlying basis  earnings per share almost doubled  up 95% to EUR 81.4 per share.The group maintains a strong capital position and a low-risk profile  which are critical as a financial market infrastructure and create headroom for further growth.Navigating a Challenging Operating Environment while Delivering Euroclear's Growth StrategyFollowing a year in which financial markets experienced negative returns from both equities and fixed income for the first time in over 50 years  activity levels in the first quarter were relatively muted  with low levels of Initial Public Offerings in equity markets and an absence of M&A activity as a driver of capital market operations. Despite this  Euroclear has continued to grow its business income  demonstrating the resilience of its business model and the continued progress in its client-centric strategy.Fixed income markets improved through the quarter  however equities remained volatile which has impacted the group entities and products  such as funds  where there is higher equity exposure. In addition  the higher interest rate environment has reduced demand for some product lines  such as in tri-party securities lending.Euroclear has closely monitored the recent disruption in the banking sector  taking necessary actions to ensure its resilience and support clients where appropriate. The volatility resulted in higher transaction volumes in March at a similar level to last year  following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.In addition  following the market-wide application of sanctions related to Russia  Euroclear continues to comply in its role as financial market infrastructure. See ""Implications of Russian sanctions""  below  for more details.The consequence of the operating environment is shown below in the group's key operating metrics:Q1 2023 Change vs Q1 2022 3-year CAGR Assets under Custody EUR 36.4 trillion -1 % 7.4 % Number of transactions 80 million 0 % 3.3 % Turnover (Value of transactions processed) EUR 275 trillion +1 % 6.6 % Fund assets under custody EUR 2.9 trillion -4 % 11.1 % Collateral Highway EUR 1.7 trillion -12 % 5.7 %At the same time  Euroclear has continued to deliver on its five-year growth strategy and strives towards its ambitious long-term vision to build a digital and data-enabled financial market infrastructure.In line with this vision  Euroclear recently announced a collaboration with Tradeweb and Informa Global Markets to automate the identification and setup process for newly issued Eurobond securities in the primary market. The initiative is expected to reduce cost and risk to the investor community by providing quicker access to reliable deal information.Consistent with its strategy  Euroclear is now exploring further opportunities as it continues the integration of MFEXbyEuroclear to build a compelling proposition for funds services. This includes services in private markets assets  where Euroclear has announced its intention to acquire Goji  a UK-based FinTech (subject to regulatory approvals).A further innovation was delivered in the Negotiable European Commercial Paper Market as Euroclear France opened its services to Italian issuers for the first time. By using the service  Unicredit became the first issuer to access the second largest short-term funding market in Europe.Implications of Russian sanctionsRussia's invasion of Ukraine resulted in market-wide application of international sanctions  which had a material impact on Euroclear's financial market infrastructure. Well established processes are in place which have allowed the group to implement the sanctions while maintaining the normal course of business.There is  however  additional complexity because the package of sanctions is wide-ranging and  moreover  Russia does not recognise the international sanctions and has implemented its own economic countermeasures. Euroclear maintains regular dialogue with clients and other impacted stakeholders in managing the market issues and implications of Russian countermeasures.The international sanctions and Russian countermeasures resulted in a loss of activities from sanctioned clients and Russian securities which impacted business income. However  it has been more than offset by increased interest income.The cash on the balance sheet has increased as blocked coupon payments and redemptions accumulate. At the end of March 2023  Euroclear Bank's balance sheet had increased by EUR 88 billion year-on-year to a total of EUR 140 billion.As per Euroclear's standard process  which is the same for any client's long cash balances  the cash balances arising from the sanctions are invested to minimise credit risk. Over Q1 2023  interest arising on cash balances from Russia-sanctioned assets was EUR 734 million.Future earnings linked to the sanctions will continue to depend on the prevailing interest rate environment and the evolution of the sanctions. The Board expects interest income to continue to grow as blocked payments and redemptions continue to accumulate  albeit at a slower pace during 2023.As previously outlined  while the Russian sanctions materially impact the balance sheet  the impact on the group's capital ratios is not expected to be significant. Euroclear maintains a strong capital position.The nature of the activities undertaken as a financial market infrastructure has led various parties to contest the sanctions and countermeasures  as well as their application  with legal proceedings ongoing in both the European Union and Russia. At present these legal proceedings are not presently considered a material risk and have not incurred any financial impact.Furthermore  Euroclear notes that analysis is being undertaken by the European Commission to consider the potential generation of resources to support Ukraine from reinvestment of immobilised Russian assets.Since considerable uncertainties persist  the Board considers it necessary to separate the sanction-related earnings from the underlying financial results when assessing the company's performance and resources.Euroclear continues to act in a transparent manner with all authorities involved. The Board will continue to act cautiously by not distributing any profits related to the Russian sanctions until the situation becomes clearer.AnnexesEuroclear Bank and Euroclear Investments are the two group issuing entities.

Transaktionen vil  i henhold til Deutsche Börses vurdering  kræve sædvanlig fusionsgodkendelse i EU  godkendelse i henhold til Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act af 1976 i USA  og FDI-godkendelse i et begrænset antal EU-jurisdiktioner. Deutsche Börse har indledt arbejdet med de ansøgninger  der er relevante for transaktionen. Deutsche Börse har i Aftalen afgivet visse tilsagn og forpligtelser over for SimCorp med henblik på at sikre  at de lovgivningsmæssige betingelser opfyldes. På samme måde har SimCorp afgivet visse tilsagn og forpligtelser om at understøtte Deutsche Börse i deres bestræbelser på at opfylde disse betingelser og i øvrigt i forbindelse med Tilbuddet. Hverken SimCorp eller Deutsche Börse vil være forpligtet til at betale ""break-fees"" eller bøder  hvis betingelserne for gennemførelse af Tilbuddet ikke opfyldes  og Tilbuddet ikke gennemføres. Finansiering Deutsche Börse vil finansiere Tilbuddet fuldt ud med kontanter og gæld. Deutsche Börse har indgået en fuldt garanteret låneaftale med Morgan Stanley  som forventes at blive refinansieret ved hjælp af en optimal blanding af eksisterende kontanter og gældsinstrumenter. Den planlagte finansiering af det forslåede Tilbud forventes at resultere i en AA- kreditvurdering på koncernniveau og en fastholdelse af en AA kreditvurdering på Clearstream-niveau. Deutsche Börse er fast besluttet på at bevare en robust kreditvurdering på koncernniveau og på Clearstream-niveau efter gennemførelsen af Tilbuddet. Tvangsovertagelse og afnotering Hvis Deutsche Börse efter gennemførelsen af Tilbuddet besidder det nødvendige antal SimCorp aktier i henhold til Selskabsloven (dvs. mere end 90 procent af SimCorp aktierne og de tilknyttede stemmerettigheder  eksklusive egne aktier i SimCorp)  har Deutsche Börse til hensigt at indlede og gennemføre en tvangsovertagelse af de resterende minoritetsaktier i SimCorp  som besiddes af SimCorp aktionærer  i overensstemmelse med Selskabsloven. Deutsche Börse har til hensigt at søge om at få SimCorps aktier slettet fra handel og officiel notering på Nasdaq Copenhagen A/S på et passende tidspunkt efter gennemførelsen af Tilbuddet.

International (ledende rådgiver) og Deutsche Bank AG som finansielle rådgivere samt Plesner Advokatpartnerselskaber  Hengeler Mueller von Rechtsanwälten mbB  Linklaters LLP (finansiering) og Cravath  Swaine & Moore LLP (U.S. rådgiver) som juridiske rådgivere i forbindelse med Tilbuddet.

Udelukkede jurisdiktioner Tilbuddet vil ikke være et tilbud  og SimCorp aktierne vil ikke blive accepteret fra eller på vegne af personer  i enhver jurisdiktion  hvor et sådant tilbud eller accept heraf ikke ville være i overensstemmelse med værdipapirlovgivningen eller andre love og bestemmelser i en sådan jurisdiktion (de ""Udelukkede Jurisdiktioner""). Personer  der modtager denne meddelelse og/eller kommer i besiddelse af denne meddelelse  er forpligtet til at tage behørigt hensyn til og overholde alle sådanne restriktioner og indhente alle nødvendige tilladelser  godkendelser eller samtykker.

Enhver person (herunder  men ikke begrænset til  depotforvaltere  nominees  og trustees)  der har til hensigt at videresende denne meddelelse til en jurisdiktion uden for Danmark  bør orientere sig om lovgivningen i den relevante jurisdiktion  inden de foretager sig noget. Distributionen af denne meddelelse i andre jurisdiktioner end Danmark kan være begrænset ved lov  og derfor bør personer  der kommer i besiddelse af denne meddelelse  informerer sig om og overholde sådanne restriktioner. Enhver manglende overholdelse af sådanne restriktioner kan udgøre en overtrædelse af værdipapirlove og regler i en sådan jurisdiktion. Information til SimCorp Aktionærer i USA Tilbuddet vil være er underlagt dansk lovgivning. Tilbuddet vil vedrøre værdipapirer i et dansk selskab og vil være underlagt oplysningsforpligtelserne i henhold til dansk lovgivning  som på væsentlige områder kan være forskellige fra dem  der gælder i USA. Tilbuddet vil blive fremsat i USA i overensstemmelse med section 14(e) og gældende bestemmelser i regulation 14E bekendtgjort i Exchange Act med forbehold for ""Tier II"" undtagelser  der fremgår af rule 14-1(d) i Exhange Act og i øvrigt i henhold til danske lovkrav. Tilbuddet vil være ikke underlagt section 14(d)(1) i eller Regulation 14D bekendtgjort i Exchange Act. Tilbuddet vil derfor være underlagt oplysningskrav  som kan være anderledes end dem  der gælder i henhold til amerikansk lovgivning  procedurer og praksis. Herudover er de finansielle oplysninger i denne meddelelse ikke udarbejdet i overensstemmelse med almindeligt anerkendte regnskabsprincipper i USA og kan derfor ikke nødvendigvis sammenlignes med finansielle oplysninger vedrørende amerikanske virksomheder. Tilbuddet vil blive fremsat til SimCorp Aktionærer hjemmehørende i USA på samme vilkår og betingelser som dem  der gælder for andre SimCorp Aktionærer  til hvem Tilbuddet fremsættes. Alle dokumenter  inklusive denne meddelelse  vil blive formidlet til SimCorp Aktionærer  der er hjemmehørende  har hjemsted eller har sædvanligt opholdssted i USA (""Amerikanske SimCorp Aktionærer"")  på et grundlag  der med rimelighed kan sammenlignes med den metode  hvormed sådanne dokumenter vil blive udleveret til andre SimCorp Aktionærer. Amerikanske SimCorp Aktionærer skal være opmærksomme på  at denne meddelelse og tilbudsdokumentet og andre dokumenter vedrørende Tilbuddet  inklusive bilag  vil blive udarbejdet i overensstemmelse med danske love og danske standarder  som kan afvige fra amerikanske love og amerikanske standarder. Fremgangsmåden for at tilbyde værdipapirer og afregne vederlag  der skal betales til hver enkelt SimCorp aktionær  der accepterer Tilbuddet  vil være i henhold til gældende danske regler  der på væsentlige områder kan være forskellige fra de regler og fremgangsmåder  der er gældende for et købstilbud vedrørende værdipapirerne i et amerikansk indregistreret selskab  særligt for så vidt angår tilbagekaldelsesret  tidsplan for købstilbuddet  afviklingsprocedurer og betalingstidspunkt for værdipapirerne. Det kan være vanskeligt for Amerikanske SimCorp Aktionærer at håndhæve visse rettigheder og krav  de måtte have i forbindelse med Tilbuddet i medfør af den amerikanske værdipapirlovgivning  idet Deutsche Börse og SimCorp er placeret i jurisdiktioner uden for USA  og nogle af eller alle deres respektive bestyrelses- og direktionsmedlemmer er hjemmehørende i jurisdiktioner uden for USA. Amerikanske SimCorp Aktionærer vil muligvis ikke kunne anlægge sag mod Deutsche Börse eller SimCorp og/eller deres respektive direktions- og bestyrelsesmedlemmer ved en ikke-amerikansk domstol for overtrædelse af amerikansk værdipapirlovgivning. Det kan desuden være vanskeligt at tvinge Deutsche Börse og SimCorp eller deres koncernforbundne selskaber til at underkaste sig en amerikansk domstols afgørelse. I henhold til sædvanlig dansk praksis og i det omfang  det er tilladt i henhold til gældende lovgivning  herunder Rule 14e-5(b) i Exchange Act kan Deutsche Börse eller et af Deutsche Börses koncernforbundne selskaber eller nominees eller mæglere for forannævnte (der agerer som agenter eller i lignende egenskab) til enhver tid foretage visse køb eller indgå aftale om køb af SimCorp aktier uden for USA ud over i henhold til Tilbuddet. Dette kan ske før eller i løbet af den periode  hvor Tilbuddet er åbent for accept. Sådanne køb kan ske enten i markedet til gældende kurser eller i private transaktioner til forhandlede priser. Hvis Deutsche Börse  eller et af Deutsche Börses koncernforbundne selskaber eller nominees eller mæglere for forannævnte  inden gennemførelsen  erhverver SimCorp aktier til en højere pris end Tilbudsprisen  vil Deutsche Börse forhøje Tilbudsprisen tilsvarende som krævet i henhold til gældende lovgivning. Eventuelle oplysninger om sådanne køb vil blive offentliggjort gennem Nasdaq Copenhagen A/S og relevante elektroniske medier  hvis og i det omfang en sådan offentliggørelse kræves i henhold til gældende ret  regler eller bestemmelser. I øvrigt kan både Morgan Stanley & Co. International plc og deres respektive tilknyttede selskaber som led i udøvelsen af deres sædvanlige aktiviteter foretage eller eje en lang række investeringer  herunder fungere som modparter i visse derivat- eller afdækningsaftaler og aktivt handle gælds- eller aktieinstrumenter (eller relaterede afledte finansielle instrumenter) samt andre typer finansielle instrumenter (herunder banklån) for egen regning og for deres kunders regning  og sådanne aktiviteter vedrørende investeringer og finansielle instrumenter kan omfatte værdipapirer og/eller instrumenter i SimCorp.

STAHL improved all key financial performance indicators in 2022 and forecasts significant sales and earnings growth for 2023R. STAHL today published its Annual Report 2022 and has confirmed the preliminary figures: Order intake € 313.5 million (+20.0%)  Group sales € 274.3 million (+10.6%)  EBITDA pre exceptionals € 22.3 million (+24.5%)Strong growth and significant increase in profitability in the first quarter of 2023For full year 2023  the Executive Board expects sales to increase to between € 305 million and € 320 million and EBITDA pre exceptionals to improve to between € 30 million and € 36 millionWaldenburg  27 April 2023 – R. STAHL today published its Annual Report 2022 and has confirmed the preliminary figures. Financial year 2022 was dominated by the aftermath of the Corona pandemic  the impact of geopolitical upheaval and rising inflation and inter­est rates around the world. The specialist for explosion protection solutions can never­the­less look back on a successful financial year 2022 and has issued a positive outlook for 2023.Challenges mastered in 2022 – double-digit growth in order intake and salesThe demand situation  which remained sluggish at the beginning of 2022  began to improve as the year progressed. From the middle of the year onward  order intake picked up significantly and  with an increase of 20.0%  reached a record level of € 313.5 million for the full year 2022 (previous year: € 261.3 million).Due to procurement market bottlenecks  in particular when it came to semiconductors  sales development was not quite as dynamic. Group sales were up 10.6% to € 274.3 million (previous year: € 248.1 million) and was thus within the upward adjusted forecast corridor of between € 273 million and € 278 million. Order intake increased by 51.7% to a record level of € 109.4 million at the end of 2022 (previous year: € 72.2 million).Growth in all sales markets in 2022In Germany  sales improved by 7.1% to € 71.8 million in the past financial year due to the strong market position in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. Sales in the Central region (Africa and Europe excluding Germany) climbed by 9.3 % to € 117.6 million. The main sales drivers here too were the chemical and pharmaceutical industries combined with strong demand from the oil and gas sector  including LNG. Markets in America recorded a significant increase of 41.7% to € 31.6 million. In addition to the oil and gas industry  demand in general also picked up speed in this region. Given the COVID-19 restrictions in much of Asia in the first half of 2022  sales growth was lowest in the Asia/Pacific region with an increase of 4.2% to € 53.3 million.Significant improvement in profitability – EBITDA pre exceptionals up 24.5%Increasing demand in almost all industries and regions in the third and fourth quarters of 2022 strengthened R. STAHL’s profitability. Targeted cost management  particularly in terms of personnel  also had a positive effect on EBITDA pre exceptionals. At € 22.3 million  it was 24.5% higher than in the previous year (€ 17.9 million) and thus within the upwardly adjusted forecast range (€ 21 million to € 24 million). The company increased its profitability as measured by the EBITDA margin from 7.2% in the previous year to 8.1%. The bottom line is a net profit of € 1.9 million (previous year: € -4.9 million). This corresponds to earnings per share of € 0.30 (previous year: € -0.76).The company improved free cash flow by € 1.8 million to € -4.4 million (previous year: € -6.3 million). The equity ratio jumped from 20.2% in the previous year to 27.5% as of the balance sheet date.Strong first quarter 2023 – order intake  sales and EBITDA increase significantlyR. STAHL has had a dynamic start in financial year 2023. Demand for R. STAHL’s products and services was very high in all sales regions. Based on preliminary figures  the company improved its order intake in the first quarter by 28.7% to € 96.7 million (previous year: € 75.1 million). Sales also recorded a significant 28.0% jump to € 78.1 million (previous year: € 61.0 million). EBITDA pre exceptionals increased particularly sharply  up € 7.3 million to € 10.4 million (previous year: € 3.0 million). The EBITDA margin pre exceptionals thus improved from 5.0% in the previous year to 13.3%.Forecast for 2023 – further growth and significant increase in profitabilityFor 2023  the company expects a further recovery in the relevant key markets based on the overall economic and industry-specific forecasts. Forecast uncertainties remain  mainly due to procurement bottlenecks – especially for semiconductor products – as well as continuing high inflation rates and unpredictable developments and consequences of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.The high order backlog that R. STAHL started 2023 with  as well as the positive first quarter of year  mean that the company can look ahead to full year 2023 with confidence. The Executive Board expects consolidated sales to grow in the low double-digit percentage range to between € 305 million and € 320 million.Profitability is expected to improve significantly year-on-year on the basis of a general improvement in procurement markets and due to increased cost efficiency. Assuming that it remains possible to pass on price adjustments from 2021 and 2022  the materials ratio is expected to decline. EBITDA pre exceptionals should therefore increase significantly and be within a corridor of between € 30 million and € 36 million (2022: € 22.3 million). In terms of free cash flow  R. STAHL expects a low single-digit positive million euro amount in 2023.“We have continued the momentum from the second half of 2022 and got off to a very good start in the new year. In addition to the strategy we are pursuing  which is starting to bear fruit  R. STAHL is also benefiting from economic and social megatrends.

This was due in particular to the significant year-on-year decline in energy prices. Nevertheless  Inflation rates for goods and services remained high in the first three months of 2023 and had a dampening effect on consumption and investment. Overall  economic output in the euro zone returned to the level seen before the Covid 19 pandemic. The Chinese economy recovered after the end of the zero Covid policy.Against the background of the pronounced capacity expansions of the previous year in both air and ocean freight  freight rates moved back to or in some cases even below pre-crisis levels in the first quarter of 2023  with decreased handling volumes  and were thus very significantly below their historic peak in the first quarter of the previous year. Both markets declined year-on-year in the first three months of 2023 due to the strained global economy.Net assets  financial situation and earnings positionRevenues The Logwin Group's sales of EUR 362.4m declined as expected in the first quarter of 2023 following the surge in sales in previous years (2022: EUR 587.9m). The Air + Ocean business segment generated sales of EUR 252.0m  significantly down on the previous year (2022: EUR 471.9m) due to the significant year-on-year decline in air and ocean freight rates and reduced volumes. In the Solutions business segment  sales of EUR 110.8m were below the previous year's figure of EUR 116.8m.EBITA At EUR 24.9m  the Logwin Group's operating result (EBITA) developed satisfactorily in the market environment of the first quarter and  in line with the forecast  remained below the previous year's result (2022: EUR 38.3m). The Air + Ocean business segment achieved a quarterly result below the level of the previous year due to the revenue development. The Solutions business segment generated an improved result from current business activities in the first quarter. In the previous year  non-recurring income had increased the business segment's operating profit in the first quarter  while in the current year non-recurring effects  including from the insolvency of a customer  impacted the quarterly result.Net result Following the decline in operating result  the Logwin Group's net result for the period amounted to EUR 19.5m in the first quarter of 2023 (2022: EUR 28.3m).Free cash flow The Logwin Group was able to increase its free cash flow in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the previous year  in particular due to positive working capital effects. The overall financial situation and liquidity of the Logwin Group were thus strengthened once again.Risks and change in forecastCompared with the disclosures in the Annual Financial Report 2022  the risk situation for the Logwin Group has not changed significantly overall. There is still an increased economic risk with regard to persistently high inflation and a possible renewed tightening of the energy supply situation. In addition  there are uncertainties with regard to the current geopolitical tensions as well as with regard to financial market stability. As part of its risk management  Logwin identifies emerging risks at an early stage and pursues their minimization. Nevertheless  an unexpected negative impact on the net assets  financial situation and earnings position of the Logwin Group cannot be ruled out. With regard to other existing and potential risks  we refer to the Annual Financial Report 2022.Compared with the forecast report in the Annual Financial Report 2022  no significant changes have occurred with regard to the expected development of the Logwin Group. Assuming a relatively low level of freight rates in the course of the year  the Logwin Group continues to expect a significant reduction in revenues compared with the previous year and a decline in operating result (EBITA) and net result.The aforementioned key performance indicators (KPIs) are an integral part of Logwin Groups system of key figures and are described and defined in the section Financial Performance Management of the management report of the Annual Financial Report 2022 (page 1 et seq.) in line with the European Securities and Markets Authoritys (ESMA) Guidelines on Alternative Performance Measures (APM) dated 5 October 2015.The Quarterly statement as of 31 March 2023 of Logwin Group is available on the internet at: www.logwin-logistics.comAbout Logwin AGLogwin AG (Grevenmacher  Luxembourg) provides efficient logistics and transport solutions for its customers from industry and trade.

The latter implies a resolution to formally reduce the capital of the Company ( kapitaalvermindering ) to be effectuated after the conclusion of a formal capital reduction process including a two-month opposition period for creditors ( crediteurenverzet ).To be able to make a distribution in the form of repaid capital  two subsequent changes to the current articles of association of the Company have to be made  by first increasing the nominal value of the shares with EUR 0.05  thus increasing the issued share capital of the Company at the charge of the share premium reserve recognized for Dutch tax purposes and secondly by decreasing the nominal value of the shares back to the current nominal value  thus decreasing the issued share capital of the Company  which decrease of the nominal value of the ordinary shares is paid to the shareholders for the repaid capital part of the distribution and which decrease of the nominal value of the special shares will be allocated to the general share premium reserve (algemene agioreserve) of the Company. Reference is made to the texts of the proposals to amend the articles of association in English and Dutch  which can be found on the website.Consequently  the proposal consists of three parts:The proposal to make a distribution as set out above; The proposal to  with approval of the supervisory board  amend the articles of association of the Company by an increase of the nominal value of the shares from EUR 0.01 to EUR 0.06  thus increasing the issued share capital of the Company at the charge of the share premium reserve recognized for Dutch tax purposes; and The proposal to  with approval of the supervisory board  amend the articles of association of the Company by a decrease of the nominal value of the shares fromEUR 0.06 to the current nominal value of EUR 0.01  thus decreasing the issued share capital of the Company  which decrease of the nominal value of the ordinary shares is paid to the shareholders for the repaid capital part of the distribution and which decrease of the nominal value of the special shares will be allocated to the general share premium reserve (algemene agioreserve) of the Company.The proposal to amend the articles of association of the Company also includes authorizing any and all managing directors of the Company  supervisory directors of the Company and the company secretary as well as any and all lawyers and paralegals practicing with Zuidbroek B.V.  each individually  to have the deeds of amendment to the articles of association executed.Furthermore  this proposal includes the proposal to the General Meeting to designate the management board as the authorized body – with the approval of the supervisory board – to issue a number of ordinary shares up to the amount necessary for the payment of the distribution in ordinary shares to the shareholders entitled to the share distribution and to exclude pre-emptive rights in relation to this issue.If the above distribution is resolved upon  the ordinary shares will be traded ‘ex-dividend’ as of Thursday 17 August 2023. The ‘record date’ will be Friday 18 August 2023. The distribution of the ordinary shares will take place by charging the share premium reserve recognized for Dutch tax purposes  free of withholding tax in The Netherlands.The number of ordinary share distribution rights entitled to one new ordinary share will be determined based on the volume-weighted average price (""VWAP"") of all traded Company’s ordinary shares at Euronext Amsterdam on Monday 21 August 2023 and Tuesday 22 August 2023. Rights to fractions of ordinary shares shall be paid in cash. There will be no trading in ordinary share distribution rights. The distributions will be payable as of Friday 25 August 2023.All ordinary shares to be issued for the ordinary share distribution will be offered and admitted to trading on Euronext Amsterdam without a prospectus pursuant to the Prospectus Regulation (Prospectusverordening).Planning distribution 17 August 2023 Ex-dividend before opening of business 18 August 2023 Record date dividend at close of business 25 August 2023 Payment date dividendAgenda item 3(a): Discharge of the managing directors for the financial year 2022 (voting item)It is proposed to discharge all managing directors in office in the financial year 2022 from all liability in relation to the exercise of their duties in the financial year 2022  to the extent such performance is apparent from the financial statements for the financial year 2022 or other public disclosures prior to the adoption of these financial statements.Agenda item 3(b): Discharge of the supervisory directors for the financial year 2022 (voting item)It is proposed to discharge all supervisory directors in office in the financial year 2022 from all liability in relation to the exercise of their duties in the financial year 2022  to the extent such performance is apparent from the financial statements for the financial year 2022 or other public disclosures prior to the adoption of these financial statements.Agenda item 4: Reappointment of the external auditor for the financial year 2023 (voting item)The supervisory board  together with the audit committee  has assessed the relationship with and performance of the external auditor.

Today  Lectra’s Board of Directors  chaired by Daniel Harari  reviewed the unaudited consolidated financial statements for the first quarter of 2023.Comparisons between 2023 and 2022 are based on 2022 exchange rates unless otherwise stated (“like-for-like”). As the impact of the acquisition of TextileGenesis (see press release dated December 8  2022) on the financial statements for 2023 is not material  like-for-like changes exclude only the variations in exchange rates.SUMMARY FOR Q1 2023Strong decline in new system ordersAgainst the backdrop of slower global growth  persistent inflation  and rising interest rates  the first quarter of 2023 was marked by a wait-and-see attitude on the part of the Group's customers around the world with regard to their investment decisions. This situation is reflected in a sharp slowdown in new system orders.Orders for perpetual software licenses  equipment and accompanying software  and non-recurring services (35.7 million euros) were down 32%.Orders for new software subscriptions continued to rise. Their annual value came to 2.7 million euros  increasing by 13% compared to 2022 (+14% at actual exchange rates).Story continuesDespite the low order intake  Q1 revenues in 2023 amounted to 123.7 million euros  stable compared to the same period of 2022  due to strong growth in revenues from recurring contracts  which benefited in particular from the growth in software subscription orders and the acceleration of synergies from the Gerber acquisition.EBITDA before non-recurring items totaled 19.7 million euros  down 12%  and the EBITDA margin before non-recurring items was 16.0%  down 2.1 percentage points.Income from operations before non-recurring items amounted to 12.1 million euros  down 20%. This included a 3.2-million-euro charge for amortization of intangible assets arising from the acquisitions carried out since 2021.Net income amounted to 7.3 million euros  down 21% at actual exchange rates.Free cash flow before non-recurring items came to 9.2 million euros  up 1.8 million euros compared to Q1 2022.A particularly robust balance sheetAt March 31  2023  the Group had a particularly robust balance sheet with a consolidated shareholders’ equity of 417.9 million euros and a positive net cash position of 7.8 million euros. In Q1  the Company paid 15.2 million euros in respect of the acquisition of the majority of the capital of TextileGenesis.The working capital requirement at March 31  2023 was a negative 5.0 million euros.BUSINESS TRENDS AND OUTLOOKIn its financial report on the third quarter and first nine months of 2022  published October 25  2022  Lectra reiterated its 4.0 strategy  initiated in 2017  and presented an assessment of the 2020-2022 roadmap  specifying that the progress made during the period  as well as the acquisitions of 2021  and the Gerber acquisition in particular  had given the Group a new dimension and increased opportunities for continued growth.Then  in its 2022 Financial Report  published February 8  2023  Lectra presented its new roadmap for 2023-2025.The Group also specified that 2023 remained unpredictable given the degraded macroeconomic and geopolitical environment  which lead to numerous uncertainties that could continue to weigh upon the investment decisions of its customers.The business activity and results in Q1 2023 confirmed this situation.Revised 2023 outlook due to wait-and-see attitude of customersAt the beginning of the year  the Group set itself objectives of achieving  in 2023  revenues in the range of 522 to 576 million euros and EBITDA before non-recurring items in the range of 90 to 113 million euros. These scenarios were prepared on the basis of the closing exchange rates on December 30  2022  and particularly $1.07/€1.While visibility remains low on the level of new system orders for the coming quarters  it is high on recurring revenues  which should represent 65% of total revenues in 2023 and are expected to grow significantly. The weight and increase in recurring revenues  combined with the measures taken by the Group in April to reduce certain overheads  will mitigate the impact of low new order intake on revenues and EBITDA before non-recurring items.Therefore  the Group now anticipates revenues in the range of 485 to 525 million euros (-5% to +3% at constant exchange rates relative to 2022) and EBITDA before non-recurring items in the range of 78 to 95 million euros (-15% to +3% at constant exchange rates relative to 2022). These new scenarios were prepared on the basis of the closing exchange rates on April 27  2023  for the remaining nine months of the year  and particularly $1.10/€1. The mechanical impact of the evolution in exchange rates compared to those used at the beginning of the year is a decline in revenues of 4.5 million euros and in EBITDA before non-recurring items of 2.5 million euros.Because the Group's customers operate in a highly competitive environment that demands they continue to improve performance  their investments will pick up as soon as the macroeconomic situation improves. Lectra's roadmap for 2023-2025  which was launched on January 1  will enable the Group to take full advantage of the upturn and accelerate its growth.The 2022 Financial Report  as well as the Management Discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations and the financial statements for Q1 2023 are available on lectra.com. The Shareholders' Meeting will be held on April 28  2023  in the Company’s offices.

Accordingly  revenues fell sharply by 5% in the Off-Trade  due to disruptions that prevented the Group from meeting all customer demand  an adverse inventory effect among some customers and the postponement of promotional operations scheduled for Q1 until H2 2023. In the below 12-year blended whisky market  down 2.0%1 in terms of sales revenue  William Peel recorded a sharper decline. It is also worth noting the slowdown in consumer sales for Marie Brizard  Sobieski and Berger  while San José increased its market share despite the drop in sales. The Group is experiencing strong resilience among agency brands  driven by controlled promotional activity and targeted activation operations during the year’s high points.Story continuesThe On-Trade channel is thriving  posting Q1 2023 growth of 28% compared to the same period in 2022.International clusterThe International cluster posted first quarter 2023 revenues of €27.1m  up 30.3% versus 2022 at constant exchange rates.Spain saw an upswing of 63% over the quarter  bolstered by the branded business (up 6%) and strong momentum in subcontracting industrial services.In Western Europe export markets  the 11% drop in revenues is linked to the UK market  where the Marie Brizard brand continues to record a significant decline in distribution.Lithuania posted a strong 54% increase in revenues driven mainly by the branded business following price increases  reinvestment and related marketing initiatives. Domestic sales continued to rise  up 10% compared to 2022  mainly driven by the Bajoru regional vodka brand and despite a decline in local bulk sales. Export sales soared  driven by William Peel and the bulk segment.In Bulgaria  revenues rose sharply by 50%: Up 33% in the domestic market (William Peel and vodka category) and 63% in export markets (particularly subcontracting industrial services)  boosted by the price increases implemented in 2022 and early 2023.Scandinavia posted revenue growth of 10% in Q1  driven by Gautier and Marie Brizard  once again reflecting price increases and new listings.In the Eastern European export markets  sales in Poland were down 14% compared to 2022 (mainly Cognac Gautier and William Peel).In the United States  the 36% decrease in revenues was due to inventory rundown by our local importer and the low depletion rate following difficulties caused by the change in some routes to market in key states for the Sobieski brand and successive price increases in 2022 for Marie Brizard and Gautier.Indeed  changes made by our importer in some strategic regional routes to market have generated operational  logistical and commercial difficulties that have affected our brands’ performance. This was exacerbated by problems in the supply of glass for production destined for the North American market.Revenues rose in Brazil  mainly driven by local brands  the positive impact of significant price increases over the period and the ramp-up of a rigorous sales policy implemented at the end of 2022 in order to improve the subsidiary’s earnings.In the Americas export market  up slightly by 3%  Canada struggled  posting a significant decline in revenues year-on-year due to stock clearance among some major customers and tough competition in the vodka segment  partially offset by Cognac Gautier (up 11%) and Marie Brizard (up 19%).Lastly  Asia-Pacific revenues were down 15%  including a sharper decline in South Korea  due to shipment phasing during the period compared to a strong first quarter 2022.OutlookAfter a year 2022 marked by overall resilience in the face of availability and inflation constraints  the effects of supply disruptions and declining volumes in Q4 2022 also impacted the first quarter of 2023  particularly in France. However  Q1 revenue was boosted by the effects of significant international price increases in 2022 and Q1 2023. These price increases are intended to cushion the significant and persistent surges in input costs (particularly for energy and raw materials)  which have further increased in early 2023 (particularly for glassware)  but have only partially offset these effects at this stage.The Group is therefore entering a pivotal period during which it will have to closely monitor elasticity in consumer demand in the face of price increases  while managing the problems caused by disruptions in availability and logistics as well as possible. The Group proved its ability to adapt in 2022 and is working to remain on track despite these difficulties.Visibility remains low in some countries more heavily exposed to these elements  such as the concentrated and increasingly mature French market where volumes are in sharp decline. This persisting instability has prompted the Group to maintain a cautious approach regarding its short and medium-term business outlook.Financial calendarGeneral Meeting: 29/06/2023H1 2023 revenues: 27/07/2023Investors and shareholders relations contactGroupe MBWSEmilie Drexleremilie.drexler@mbws.comPhone: +33 1 43 91 62 40Press contactImage SeptClaire Doligez - Laurence Maurycdoligez@image7.fr – lmaury@image7.frPhone : +33 1 53 70 74 70About Marie Brizard Wine & SpiritsMarie Brizard Wine & Spirits is a Group of wines and spirits based in Europe and the United States.

However  Vantiva confirms its full year guidance.Group’s revenues amounted to €573m in the quarter  up 2.5% (-0.6% at constant exchange rate).Connected Home contributed €458m  an increase of 12.1% (+8.7% at constant exchange rate).SCS contributed €115 million  a decrease of 23.3% (-25.4% at constant exchange rate).Vantiva continues to optimize productivity and efficiency across all activities.FY guidance is confirmed.Luis Martinez-Amago  Chief Executive Officer of Vantiva  said:“The environment continued to be challenging  as we had anticipated. Markets are showing some signs of softening  however our action plans are responding well to this situation and we keep executing our commercial plan. In this context  we are delighted with the performance of the Connected Home division this quarter. The DVD business in our Supply Chain Solutions division was impacted by a lack of new titles in the quarter. Nonetheless  at the group level  Vantiva remains on track to achieve its stated goals”.I- Q1 2023 RevenuesIn € million  continuing operations 2023 2022 Change at current rate Change at constant rate Revenues 573 559 2.5% -0.6%Q1 2023 Key Hi ghlightsThe 2.5% growth achieved in the quarter resulted from a contrasting performance of the two divisions. Connected Home benefited from continuing good demand for broadband and the division posted a 12.1% growth rate for the period. SCS  however  is facing a more challenging environment in the field of optical discs where demand declined during the quarter. SCS nevertheless continued and expanded its diversification activities and mitigated some of this decline  but revenues for the division were still down 23.3% in the quarter.OutlookThe group confirmed its guidance for the fiscal year 2023:EBITDA > €140mEBITA> € 45 mFCF(1) > €50m(1) Before interest and taxII- Q1 Segment ReviewConnected HomeRevenues breakdown by productIn € million 2023 2022 Change at current rate Change at constant rate Revenues 458 408 12.1% 8.7% o/w by product Broadband 381 322 18.2% 14.0% Video 77 86 -10.4% -10.9%Connected Home revenues represented 80% of group revenues in the quarter (73% in Q1 22) and totaled €458 million  up 12.1%. At constant exchange rate  the growth would have been 8.7% compared with Q1 2022. Beyond the positive effect of exchange rates  this development in revenue resulted from some growth in North American markets driven by cable and WiFi 6 CPEs  but also from double-digit growth in Europe and Latam. The increase in the latter regions is explained by better supply conditions  strong demand for broadband fiber products and business with new customers. On the other hand  demand for video equipment continued to suffer in Latam and India.Supply Chain SolutionsIn € million 2023 2022 Change at current rate Change at constant rate Revenues 115 150 -23.3% -25.4%Supply Chain Solutions’ revenues for the quarter represented 20% of Group revenues (27% in Q1 22) and totaled €115 million in the quarter  a 23.3% decrease compared to Q1 2022. At constant exchange rate the drop would have been 25.4%. This decline was due to the headwinds experienced by the mature optical discs business which was penalized by limited numbers of new releases from the major studios during the quarter  the reduction in DVDs inventories at some retailers and a less favorable economic environment overall. Diversification activities grew in line with expectations in the quarter. The division accelerated the implementation of productivity actions and diversification initiatives including investments in vinyl capacity extension.Corporate & OtherIn € million 2023 2022 Change at current rate Change at constant rate Revenues 0 1 nm nm###Warning: Forward Looking StatementsThis press release contains certain statements that constitute ""forward-looking statements""  including but not limited to statements that are predictions of or indicate future events  trends  plans or objectives  based on certain assumptions or which do not directly relate to historical or current facts.

In order to allow the analysis of its future reporting Coface is reporting today 2022 pro forma accounts1. Coface has also been applying the IFRS 9 standard since 1st January 2023 but there will be no pro forma set of accounts.These 2022 pro-forma figures need to be analysed in conjunction with first time application (FTA) as the transition from one standard to another creates short-term differences. Profit recognition pace is different between IFRS 4 and IFRS 17. In the mid-term though  both standards will converge in terms of shareholders’ equity and earnings.Reserving philosophy remains broadly unchanged. In particular  undiscounted current underwriting year loss ratios are almost identical between the previous IFRS 4 and the new IFRS 17 standard.Coface’s strategy remains unaffected by IFRS 17. Coface will continue to report and to rely on the same KPIs with very limited definition changes. Moreover  the Build to Lead through the cycle objectives remain valid under the new framework.Phalla Gervais  Coface’s Chief Financial & Risk Officer  commented:“Today’s reporting of our pro forma IFRS 17 figures marks an important milestone in a key accounting project. I would first like to thank Coface’s teams who have achieved this transforming project for the finance function. IFRS 17 will not change Coface’s business or strategy. It will lead to a somehow faster profit recognition and will further align practices and strengthen the robustness of the reserving process.Last  I am happy to confirm that our Build to Lead through the cycle targets remain valid under the new accounting framework.”-----------------------------------------------------Conference call for financial analystsCoface’s 2022 pro forma accounts following IFRS 17 application will be discussed with financial analysts during the conference call on 27 April 2023 at 18.00 (Paris time).

It is specified that the escrow account no longer bears negative interest since July 2022 and that the amount credited to the escrow account amounts to 277 021 430 Euros  corresponding to the total subscription price of the Units.Such buy-back of the Market Shares will be carried out for cancellation and capital reduction purposes  subject to the Company's creditors not objecting to such capital reduction during the legal period of 20 days (or  in the event of objection during this period  to the commercial court's reject thereof).On June 2  2023  in accordance with its Articles of Association and the Prospectus and subject to the absence of any objection to the capital reduction from the Company's creditors during the aforementioned legal period  the Board of Directors will acknowledge that no IBC has been completed  will determine the effective date of the Market Shares buy-back and  accordingly  the Company will issue a press release announcing its decision to proceed with such buy-back on the date so determined (the “Final Buy-Back Notice”).If so  on such date  expected to be June 12  2023 (subject to the above conditions)  the effective buy-back will be carried out for all the Market Shares  without any action being required from the holders of Market Shares: on such date  the centralizing agent will pay to each holder of Market Shares an amount equal to the number of Market Shares it holds multiplied by 10 Euros. All Market Shares will then be immediately bought back and cancelled  by way of capital reduction.For the purposes of the above transactions  the listing of the Market Shares and the Market Warrants would be suspended as of June 8  2023  and the Market Shares and the Market Warrants would be delisted by Euronext Paris on June 12  2023.An indicative timetable of the next steps is provided below  and will be confirmed as part of the Final Buy-Back Notice.At the end of these operations  the holders of Founder Shares will meet in a combined general meeting in order to  inter alia  approve the accounts for the financial year ending on 31 December 2022  and to decide on the early dissolution and liquidation of the Company. It is anticipated that upon liquidation  the holders of Founder Shares will not be able to recover the full amount of their contributions to the Company.As a result of the failure to complete an IBC on the Initial Business Combination Deadline  the Market Warrants and the Founder Warrants will be definitively deprived of any exercise right  and will expire without any value in the context of the forthcoming liquidation  in accordance with their respective terms and conditions  the Company's Articles of Association  the Prospectus and the Company's press release dated May 28  2021.AAC also announces today the availability of its annual financial report for the year ended December 31  2022  filed with the Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF).

Agenda item 2(b): Remuneration report for the management board and supervisory board for the financial year 2022 (advisory voting item) In accordance with section 2:135b paragraph 2 Dutch Civil Code annually the remuneration report will be tabled to the General Meeting for an advisory vote. The remuneration report reports on the implementation and execution of the remuneration policies of the management board and supervisory board (the remuneration policy (which remuneration policy contains both policies) can be found on our website: https://investors.cabka.com/corporate-governance/remuneration)during the financial year 2022. The remuneration report is included on pages 70 - 74 of the 2022 annual report. Shareholders are requested to vote in favor of this remuneration report. Agenda item 2(c): Adoption of the company and consolidated financial statements for the financial year 2022 including appropriation of the net result for the financial year 2022 (voting item) It is proposed to adopt the company and consolidated financial statements for the financial year 2022 as prepared by the management board and included in the 2022 annual report. The financial statements have been drawn up in the English language and the audit has been performed by BDO Audit & Assurance B.V. The company financial statements for the financial year 2022 present a net loss of EUR 30 975 000.00. By adopting the company financial statements it is also resolved to allocate the net loss for the financial year 2022 to the accumulated deficits. Agenda item 2(d): Distribution in relation to the financial year 2022 and related amendments of the articles of association (voting item) As announced in the press release on 15 March 2023 and in accordance with the Company's articles of association it is proposed by the management board  with the approval of the supervisory board  to distribute to the holders of ordinary shares a total amount of EUR 0.15 per ordinary share  of which EUR 0.05 will be distributed in cash and EUR 0.10 will be distributed in ordinary shares. Thereto  this proposal to make a distribution in relation to the financial year 2022 consists of two elements being (i) the distribution of ordinary shares and (ii) the distribution of repaid capital. The latter implies a resolution to formally reduce the capital of the Company (kapitaalvermindering) to be effectuated after the conclusion of a formal capital reduction process including a two-month opposition period for creditors (crediteurenverzet). 2 / 8To be able to make a distribution in the form of repaid capital  two subsequent changes to the current articles of association of the Company have to be made  by first increasing the nominal value of the shares with EUR 0.05  thus increasing the issued share capital of the Company at the charge of the share premium reserve recognized for Dutch tax purposes and secondly by decreasing the nominal value of the shares back to the current nominal value  thus decreasing the issued share capital of the Company  which decrease of the nominal value of the ordinary shares is paid to the shareholders for the repaid capital part of the distribution and which decrease of the nominal value of the special shares will be allocated to the general share premium reserve (algemene agioreserve) of the Company. Reference is made to the texts of the proposals to amend the articles of association in English and Dutch  which can be found on the website. Consequently  the proposal consists of three parts: The proposal to make a distribution as set out above; The proposal to  with approval of the supervisory board  amend the articles of association of the Company by an increase of the nominal value of the shares from EUR 0.01 to EUR 0.06  thus increasing the issued share capital of the Company at the charge of the share premium reserve recognized for Dutch tax purposes; and The proposal to  with approval of the supervisory board  amend the articles of association of the Company by a decrease of the nominal value of the shares from EUR 0.06 to the current nominal value of EUR 0.01  thus decreasing the issued share capital of the Company  which decrease of the nominal value of the ordinary shares is paid to the shareholders for the repaid capital part of the distribution and which decrease of the nominal value of the special shares will be allocated to the general share premium reserve ( algemene agioreserve ) of the Company. The proposal to amend the articles of association of the Company also includes authorizing any and all managing directors of the Company  supervisory directors of the Company and the company secretary as well as any and all lawyers and paralegals practicing with Zuidbroek B.V.  each individually  to have the deeds of amendment to the articles of association executed. Furthermore  this proposal includes the proposal to the General Meeting to designate the management board as the authorized body - with the approval of the supervisory board - to issue a number of ordinary shares up to the amount necessary for the payment of the distribution in ordinary shares to the shareholders entitled to the share distribution and to exclude pre-emptive rights in relation to this issue. If the above distribution is resolved upon  the ordinary shares will be traded 'ex-dividend' as of Thursday 17 August 2023. The 'record date' will be Friday 18 August 2023. The distribution of the ordinary shares will take place by charging the share premium reserve recognized for Dutch tax purposes  free of withholding tax in The Netherlands. The number of ordinary share distribution rights entitled to one new ordinary share will be determined based on the volume-weighted average price (""VWAP"") of all traded Company's ordinary shares at Euronext Amsterdam on Monday 21 August 2023 and Tuesday 22 August 2023. Rights to fractions of ordinary shares shall be paid in cash. There will be no trading in ordinary share distribution rights. The distributions will be payable as of Friday 25 August 2023. 3 / 8All ordinary shares to be issued for the ordinary share distribution will be offered and admitted to trading on Euronext Amsterdam without a prospectus pursuant to the Prospectus Regulation (Prospectusverordening).

Agenda item 4: Reappointment of the external auditor for the financial year 2023 (voting item) The supervisory board  together with the audit committee  has assessed the relationship with and performance of the external auditor.

The audit will be carried out under the responsibility of Mr. Jeroen van Erve  audit partner at BDO Audit & Assurance B.V. Agenda item 5: Appointment of managing director (voting item) As announced in the press release on 25 April 2023  the supervisory board has nominated Mr. Frank C.H.

This project is also an opportunity to improve the existing building and to establish a long-term partnership with GEODIS through a new 12-year lease.GEODIS is a world leader in transport and logistics  number 1 in France for deliveries within 24 to 48 hours  specialising in last-mile delivery.Since 2003  the company has set up its regional hub in Bruguières from where it operates for the Haute-Garonne department  and also supplies the departmental platforms of the South-West of France. This site is ideally located for logistics and courier activities  a few kilometres north of Toulouse and along the A62 motorway.With the increase in its business volume  GEODIS needed additional space.In discussions with ARGAN  the option of extending the existing site was chosen  allowing the courier service to gain 2 200 m² and thus increase its total surface area to 13 400 m². The shape of the land did not allow for a traditional extension of the building in its length  so the ARGAN and GEODIS teams set up an innovative extension plan in its width  while allowing the site to continue to be fully operational during the construction phase.The extension of the site will be an opportunity to renovate the existing building  in particular the 1 900 m² office block  the road and the dock equipment. All of this work will significantly improve the working environment for GEODIS employees.This new development will also contribute to a significant reduction in the energy consumption with the installation of a photovoltaic plant for self-consumption and a Building Management System (BMS). In addition  the iodide lamps will be replaced by intelligent LED lighting controlled by presence and luminosity.The delivery of the extension will mark the start of a new long-term lease of 12 years  which underlines the confidence and the long-term partnership between GEODIS and ARGAN.With this new development  the real estate company also confirms its ability to support its clients in their growth projects and its focus on improving its property portfolio.Financial calendar 2023 (Press release to be issued after the stock exchange)3 July : Turnover for the 2 nd quarter 2023quarter 2023 19 July : Half-yearly results 20232 October : Turnover for the 3rd quarter 2023About ArganARGAN is the only French real estate company specialized in the DEVELOPMENT & RENTAL OF PREMIUM WAREHOUSES listed on EURONEXT.

We are particularly pleased with the strong momentum in France  the dynamism in Europe  the return to growth in Asia and the resilience of our sales in America after an excellent 2022. This quarter also saw the progress in the implementation of our ambitious CSR strategy with the acceleration of the full-traceability project roll-out on brand collections  the launch of Sandro clothing rental in the UK and the launch of our SMCP Retail Lab training school. We remain vigilant regarding the evolution of the macro-economic  social  and geopolitical context but are confident that the positive momentum will continue in the coming quarters and thus confirm our annual targets.”€m except %Unaudited figures Q1 2022 Q1 2023 Organicchange Reportedchange Constant Fx change Sales by regionFrance 93.7 106.0 +13.1% +13.1% +13.1% EMEA 83.1 88.6 +7.0% +6.6% +7.0% America 38.6 39.0 -2.5% +1.0% -2.5% APAC 67.6 71.0 +2.7% +5.1% +6.9% Sales by brand Sandro 134.1 146.0 +7.8% +8.9% +8.9% Maje 112.2 113.8 +0.4% +1.5% +1.5% Other brands1 36.8 44.8 +21.8% +21.7% +21.9% TOTAL 283.0 304.6 +6.7% +7.6% +7.6%SALES BY REGIONIn France  sales reached a record level of €106m in the first quarter  with an organic growth of +13% compared to 2022. They were mainly driven by the performance of the like-for-like network and by the demand of local and tourist customers  who are increasingly numerous both in physical shops and on the brands' websites. This double-digit growth is even more remarkable given the high basis of comparison in 2022 and the adverse social environment. The “Other brands” division (Claudie Pierlot and Fursac) recorded a strong momentum in the quarter. The Group also carried on its strategy of reducing the average discount rate  particularly in digital. The network is decreasing by four POS including the closure of the remaining two Suite 341 stores.Story continuesIn EMEA  the Group maintained a very good momentum with a robust growth despite a high basis of comparison. Sales reached €89m  +7% on an organic basis vs 2022 with a strong retail like-for-like growth of +15% from both B&M and digital sales. The good performance of the largest markets such as the United Arab Emirates  Italy and Spain was partially offset by the end of the wholesale partnership in Russia (last deliveries in February 2022). The average discount rate registered a slight decrease which comes from digital. The network is down by seven POS in Q1 excluding the impact of Russia (40 POS).In America  after an outstanding performance in 2022  sales are stabilizing in reported change and decreasing by -3% on an organic basis. During the first quarter  sales in the US were resilient with a positive like-for-like growth in B&M. The slightly unfavorable trend comes from Canada where the normalization of traffic is slower due to the low level of tourism from Asia and weak local demand. The network is down by two POS.In APAC  the growth is progressively back in the region  with €71m of sales in Q1  +3% on an organic basis vs 2022. The trend gradually improved in Mainland China over the quarter with January and February still affected by low traffic  before returning to growth in March. The region benefits from a good performance in Hong-Kong  Singapore  Malaysia and Macau and the integration of Australia and New-Zealand in our own retail network. The average discount rate decreased by more than four points with the normalization of the situation after the Covid constraints. Finally  the network continued to expand with five openings  particularly in China and Singapore.CONCLUSION AND PERSPECTIVESThanks to the strong desirability of its brands  the Group records a good performance in the first quarter.Subject to the evolution of the macro-economic  social  and geopolitical situation  SMCP confirms its financial guidance for 2023.OTHER INFORMATIONSAt its meeting of March 23  2023  the Board of Directors decided to create a Sustainability committee  which will be responsible for monitoring the consideration of social  societal  and environmental responsibility issues when defining the Group’s strategy and its implementation.FINANCIAL CALENDARJune 21st  2023 – Annual shareholders meetingJuly 27th  2023 – 2023 Half-Year ResultsA conference call with investors and analysts will be held today by CEO Isabelle Guichot and CFO Patricia Huyghues Despointes  from 9:00 a.m. (Paris time).Related slides will also be available on the website (www.smcp.com)  in the Finance section.APPENDICESBreakdown of DOSNumber of DOS Q1-22 2022 Q1-23 vs.2022 vs.Q1 2022 By region France 459 460 456 -4 -3 EMEA 395 395 391 -4 -4 America 165 166 164 -2 -1 APAC 251 259 305 +46 +54 By brand Sandro 541 551 569 +18 +28 Maje 451 457 476 +19 +25 Claudie Pierlot 209 201 203 +2 -6 Suite 341 3 2 - -2 -3 Fursac 66 69 68 -1 +2 Total DOS 1 270 1 280 1 316 +36 +46Breakdown of POSNumber of POS Q1-22 2022 Q1-23 vs.2022 vs.Q1 2022 By region France 460 461 457 -4 -3 EMEA 545 552 505 -47 -40 America 195 198 196 -2 +1 APAC 467 472 477 +5 +10 By brand Sandro 736 752 733 -19 -3 Maje 618 627 611 -16 -7 Claudie Pierlot 244 233 223 -10 -21 Suite 341 3 2 - -2 -3 Fursac 66 69 68 -1 +2 Total POS 1 667 1 683 1 635 -48 -32 o/w Partners POS 397 403 319 -84 -78FINANCIAL INDICATORS NOT DEFINED IN IFRSNumber of points of sale (POS)The number of the Group’s points of sale comprises total retail points of sale open at the relevant date  which includes (i) directly operated stores (DOS)  including free-standing stores  concessions in department stores  affiliate-operated stores  outlets and online stores  and (ii) partnered retail points of sale.Organic sales growthOrganic sales growth is the total sales in a given period compared to the same period in the previous year.

Our backlog continued to grow during the quarter  with awards in both subsea and offshore wind  and bidding remains very active in both businesses. The sustained high level of demand from our clients supports our view of a return to an Adjusted EBITDA margin range of 15-20% in the coming four years. While this year marks a period of re-investment in both the subsea and renewables businesses  we are confident that our strategy positions the Group for strong cash generation  and the return of excess capital to shareholders  next year and beyond.Notably  during the quarter we largely completed installation of the $1.2 billion fast-track Sakarya project in Türkiye and the development achieved first gas in April. After just 31 months since the initial gas discovery by the client  the project is testament to the strong and successful collaboration both with Turkish Petroleum and with SLB  our alliance partner in Subsea Integration Alliance. This ambitious schedule  in a new country for Subsea7  was led by our project management team in Istanbul  and drew on the expertise of engineers in France  the UK  Malaysia and Australia  as well as utilising vessels including Seven Arctic  Seven Oceanic and Seven Pegasus.Overall  Subsea7 delivered a satisfactory financial performance in the first quarter and we are confident in the outlook for the remainder of the year and beyond.Operational highlightsDuring the first quarter the Subsea and Conventional business unit experienced normal seasonality due to winter conditions in most of the Northern Hemisphere. Seven Oceanic  Seven Pacific  Seven Sisters and Seven Vega were active on Sakarya in Türkiye  Bacalhau in Brazil and Sangomar in Senegal. Seven Oceans was active in the Gulf of Mexico before transiting to Norway where it prepared for work on the Northern Lights carbon capture project. In the UK  against a backdrop of fiscal uncertainty  our fleet of diving support vessels achieved reduced utilisation due to the postponement of activities by clients.In the Renewables business unit Seaway Aimery and Seaway Moxie worked on the cable lay scope of Hollandse Kust Zuid in the Netherlands. Seaway Strashnov was in dry dock  as planned  for most of the first quarter and resumed operations on Dogger Bank A&B at the end of March. We also resumed activity at Seagreen and the final jacket was installed mid-April.First quarter financial reviewRevenue of $1.2 billion increased 4% compared to the prior year period reflecting strong growth of 18% in Subsea and Conventional  partially offset by a decline in Renewables due to the phasing of the Seagreen project. Adjusted EBITDA of $107 million equated to an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 8.6%  up from 7.2% in Q1 2022. After depreciation and amortisation charges of $122 million  net operating loss improved to $15 million from a loss of $31 million in the prior year period. After net finance costs of $8 million and without the benefit of the prior year’s tax credit  net loss for the quarter increased to $29 million compared to a net loss of $12 million in Q1 2022.Net cash used in operations was $127 million including a $209 million anticipated increase in net working capital. Net cash used in investing activities was $86 million while net cash generated by financing activities was $256 million which included $300 million proceeds from borrowings. Overall  cash and cash equivalents increased by $40 million from 31 December 2022 to $686 million at 31 March 2023. Net debt at the end of the first quarter was $419 million including lease liabilities of $456 million.First quarter order intake was $1.9 billion comprising new awards of $1.2 billion and escalations of $0.7 billion resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.5x. Backlog at the end of March was $9.7 billion  of which $4.0 billion is expected to be executed in 2023 and $3.4 billion in 2024.Outlook – full year 2023 on trackWe continue to expect revenue and Adjusted EBITDA in 2023 to be higher than 2022  with a weighting towards the second half of the year. Pricing and contract terms continued to improve during the first quarter and recent awards  as well as ongoing tenders  support our view that Adjusted EBITDA margins should trend back to a range of 15-20% over the coming four years. This is approaching the margin necessary to yield an appropriate return on capital employed.Conference Call InformationDate: 27 April 2023Time: 12:00 UK TimeAccess the webcast at subsea7.com or https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/obrzwjppRegister for the conference call at https://register.vevent.com/register/BI835ccb83027d4b0291b319f2cd431b57For further information  please contact:Katherine TonksHead of Investor RelationsEmail: ir@subsea7.comTelephone: +44 20 8210 5568Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking StatementsCertain statements made in this announcement may contain ‘forward-looking statements’ (within the meaning of the safe harbour provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995).

Comparisons between 2023 and 2022 are based on 2022 exchange rates unless otherwise stated (""like-for-like""). As the impact of the acquisition of TextileGenesis (see press release dated December 8  2022) on the financial statements for 2023 is not material  like-for-like changes exclude only the variations in exchange rates. Orders for new systems are reported using two indicators: on the one hand  the value of software sold separately under perpetual software licenses  equipment and accompanying software (also sold in the form of perpetual licenses) and non-recurring services; and on the other hand  the annual value of new subscriptions for software sold in Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) mode. The detailed tables of orders for new systems  of revenues  and of the income statements for the first quarter of 2023 are provided in the additional information of this report  starting on page 6. 1. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR Q1 2023 Strong decline in new system orders Against the backdrop of slower global growth  persistent inflation  and rising interest rates  the first quarter of 2023 was marked by a wait-and-see attitude on the part of the Group's customers around the world with regard to their investment decisions. This situation is reflected in a sharp slowdown in new system orders. Orders for perpetual software licenses  equipment and accompanying software  and non-recurring services (35.7 million euros) were down 32% (-31% at actual exchange rates). Orders for perpetual software licenses (3.7 million euros)  and equipment and accompanying software (26.9 million euros) decreased by 29% and 37%  respectively. Those for training and consulting (3.8 million euros) increased by 6%. Geographically  orders for perpetual software licenses  equipment and accompanying software  and non-recurring services decreased by 14% in Europe  39% in the Americas  45% in Asia-Pacific and 25% in the rest of the world (including Northern Africa  South Africa  Turkey  and the Middle East). They decreased by 32% in the automotive market  27% in the fashion market and by 31% in the furniture market. Orders for new software subscriptions continued to rise. Their annual value came to 2.7 million euros  increasing by 13% compared to 2022 (+14% at actual exchange rates). Lectra 1 Financial Report at March 31  2023 Stable revenues and decline in EBITDA before non-recurring items With an average exchange rate of $1.07/€1 in Q1  the dollar was up 5% compared to Q1 2022 and the yuan declined by 3% against the euro. Currency changes mechanically increased revenues by 1.8 million euros (+1%) and EBITDA before non-recurring items by 0.7 million euros (+4%) at actual exchange rates  compared to like-for-like figures. In its financial report on the fourth quarter and full year 2022  the Group indicated that Q1 revenues in 2023 were expected to be slightly lower due to the decline in order backlog at January 1  2023 compared to the one at January 1  2022  which was exceptionally high  and that this decrease in revenues  combined with the increase in overhead costs  would also lead to a decline in EBITDA before non-recurring items. Despite the low order intake  Q1 revenues in 2023 amounted to 123.7 million euros  stable compared to the same period of 2022  due to strong growth in revenues from recurring contracts  which benefited in particular from the growth in software subscription orders and the acceleration of synergies from the Gerber acquisition. At actual exchange rates  revenues increased by 1%. Revenues from software licenses  equipment and accompanying software  and non-recurring services Revenues from perpetual software licenses  equipment and accompanying software  and non-recurring services (43.8 million euros) were down 11%. This item contributed 35% of revenues (40% in 2022)  and included mainly: perpetual software licenses (4.1 million euros)  which decreased by 14% and accounted for 3% of revenues (4% in 2022);equipment and accompanying software (33.8 million euros)  which decreased by 15% and accounted for 27% of revenues (32% in 2022);training and consulting (4.7 million euros)  which increased by 30% and accounted for 4% of revenues (3% in 2022). At March 31  2023  the order backlog for perpetual software licenses  equipment and accompanying software  as well as training and consulting amounted to 36.2 million euros. It decreased by 8.6 million euros at actual exchange rates and by 8.3 million euros like-for-like  compared to December 31  2022. Revenues from recurring contracts  consumables and parts Revenues from recurring contracts  which represented 36% of revenues (32% in 2022)  amounted to 44.0 million euros  a 11% increase: software subscriptions (6.7 million euros)  up 52%  represented 5% of revenues (4% in 2022);software maintenance contracts (13.4 million euros)  up 4%  represented 11% of revenues (11% in 2022);equipment and accompanying software maintenance contracts (23.9 million euros)  up 7%  represented 19% of revenues (18% in 2022). In parallel  revenues from consumables and parts (35.9 million euros) were up 3% and represented 29% of revenues (28% in 2022). Overall  recurring revenues (79.9 million euros) were up 8% (+9% at actual exchange rates). Lectra 2 Financial Report at March 31  2023 Gross profit Gross profit amounted to 84.8 million euros  up 4% compared to 2022. The gross profit margin came to 68.5%  up 2.7 percentage points. This increase stems from the evolution of the product mix  with a larger share of recurring contract revenues  and from the strong improvement in the gross margin on equipment and accompanying software revenues. Personnel expenses and other operating expenses incurred in the execution of service contracts or in training and consulting are not included in the cost of goods sold but are accounted for in overhead costs. Overhead costs Overhead costs were 72.6 million euros  up 9% compared to 2022. The breakdown is as follows: 67.9 million euros in fixed overhead costs (+11%);4.8 million euros in variable costs (-9%). Research and development costs (13.6 million euros)  which are fully expensed in the period and included in fixed overhead costs  represented 11.0% of revenues (12.7 million euros and 10.4% of revenues in Q1 2022). After deducting the research tax credit applicable in France and grants received  net research and development costs totaled 12.7 million euros (10.9 million euros in 2022). EBITDA before non-recurring items  income from operations before non-recurring items and net income EBITDA before non-recurring items totaled 19.7 million euros  down 12% (-8% at actual exchange rates) and the EBITDA margin before non-recurring items was 16.0%  down 2.1 percentage points (-1.7 percentage points at actual exchange rates). Income from operations before non-recurring items amounted to 12.1 million euros  down 20%. This included a 3.2-million-euro charge for amortization of intangible assets arising from the acquisitions carried out since 2021. Net financial income and expenses represented a net charge of 1.4 million euros. Foreign exchange gains and losses generated a net loss of 0.5 million euros. After an income tax expense of 3.0 million euros  net income amounted to 7.3 million euros  down 21% at actual exchange rates. Net earnings per share were €0.20 on basic capital and on diluted capital (€0.25 on basic capital and €0.24 on diluted capital in Q1 2022). Increase in free cash flow Free cash flow before non-recurring items came to 9.2 million euros (7.1 million euros in Q1 2022). It is higher than net income. After disbursement of 0.2 million euros in Q1 in respect of fees and other related expenses in connection with the acquisition of Gerber  free cash-flow came to 9.1 million euros. A particularly robust balance sheet At March 31  2023  the Group had a particularly robust balance sheet with a consolidated shareholders' equity of 417.9 million euros and a positive net cash position of 7.8 million euros  consisting in financial debt of 119.0 million euros and cash of 126.8 million euros.

BUSINESS TRENDS AND OUTLOOK In its financial report on the third quarter and first nine months of 2022  published October 25  2022  Lectra reiterated its 4.0 strategy  initiated in 2017  and presented an assessment of the 2020-2022 roadmap  specifying that the progress made during the period  as well as the acquisitions of 2021  and the Gerber acquisition in particular  had given the Group a new dimension and increased opportunities for continued growth. Then  in its 2022 Financial Report  published February 8  2023  Lectra presented its new roadmap for 2023-2025. The Group also specified that 2023 remained unpredictable given the degraded macroeconomic and geopolitical environment  which lead to numerous uncertainties that could continue to weigh upon the investment decisions of its customers. The business activity and results in Q1 2023 confirmed this situation. Revised 2023 outlook due to wait-and-see attitude of customers At the beginning of the year the Group set itself objectives of achieving  in 2023  revenues in the range of 522 to 576 million euros and EBITDA before non-recurring items in the range of 90 to 113 million euros. These scenarios were prepared on the basis of the closing exchange rates on December 30  2022  and particularly $1.07/€1. While visibility remains low on the level of new system orders for the coming quarters  it is high on recurring revenues  which should represent 65% of total revenues in 2023 and are expected to grow significantly. The weight and increase in recurring revenues  combined with the measures taken by the Group in April to reduce certain overheads  will mitigate the impact of low new order intake on revenues and EBITDA before non-recurring items. Therefore  the Group now anticipates revenues in the range of 485 to 525 million euros (-5% to +3% at constant exchange rates relative to 2022) and EBITDA before non-recurring items in the range of 78 to 95 million euros (-15% to +3% at constant exchange rates relative to 2022). These new scenarios were prepared on the basis of the closing exchange rates on April 27  2023  for the remaining nine months of the year  and particularly $1.10/€1. The mechanical impact of the evolution in exchange rates compared to those used at the beginning of the year is a decline in revenues of 4.5 million euros and in EBITDA before non-recurring items of 2.5 million euros. Because the Group's customers operate in a highly competitive environment that demands they continue to improve performance  their investments will pick up as soon as the macroeconomic situation improves. Lectra's roadmap for 2023-2025  which was launched on January 1  will enable the Group to take full advantage of the upturn and accelerate its growth.

The AAN Annual Meeting is the world’s premier neurology meeting  attracting over 10 000 neurology professionals from around the globe.The title of this presentation is ‘Masitinib Shows Prolonged Survival in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) Patients with Mild or Moderate Disease Severity at Baseline’. The abstract will be published in an online supplement to the journal Neurology. This presentation is also available on AB Science website (available here).The new analysis that was presented was performed in ALS patients prior to any complete loss of physical function (corresponding to a score of 0 on any ALSFRS-R individual component and regardless of baseline progression rate)  which encompassed about 80% of the overall AB10015 study population. It is clinically relevant to analyze this population as patients with very severe ALS (i.e. with ALSFRS-R score of zero on any ALSFRS-R individual component) are unable to perform certain physical functions and in the context of treating neurodegenerative disease  any improvement in these lost functions is beyond what can be reasonably expected from an interventional drug  no matter how effective it may be in preventing further disease progression. The exclusion of these very severe patients is also consistent with the proposed mechanism of action of masitinib on microglia and mast cell activity to slow progression rather than as a cure for ALS. Based on this mechanism of action  it would be inappropriate to target those in the last stages of their disease.Results in these patients prior to any complete loss of physical function showed a statistically significant 18.4% relative benefit on CAFS endpoint in favor of masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/day as compared with control (p=0.035). The composite endpoint of functioning and survival (CAFS) was not a recommended primary endpoint when study AB10015 was designed. However  since completion of study AB10015  the CAFS has become increasingly requested as a primary endpoint to determine efficacy in ALS trials  by FDA and Health Canada in particular. This new result therefore represent a key analysis for study AB10015.The positive treatment-effect in CAFS was supported by converging results on change in ALSFRS-R score at week 48 (+25% difference  p=0 027)  respiratory function at week 48 (+20.4% difference  p=0 022) and quality of life at week 48 (19.8% difference  p=0 025). In addition  with long-term survival follow-up (median follow-up of 75 months)  there was a close significant median overall survival benefit of +8 months in favour of masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/day (46 [ 30; 69 ] vs 38 [ 29; 49 ]  p-value=0.0684).Furthermore  patients with moderate disease only (i.e. those patients having ALSFRS-R score greater than 1 on any ALSFRS-R individual component and no fast disease progression) showed even better survival  prolonged of 25 months with masitinib  with a reduced risk of death of 44% (P<0.05).As a reminder  the development program of masitinib in ALS comprises a 48-week clinical trial (AB10015)  including long-term survival follow-up analysis  and an on-going confirmatory phase 3 trial (AB19001).About amyotrophic lateral sclerosisAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal motor neuron disorder that is characterized by progressive loss of the upper and lower motor neurons at the spinal or bulbar level. The disease belongs to a group of disorders known as motor neuron diseases  which are characterized by the gradual degeneration and death of motor neurons. In ALS  both the upper motor neurons and the lower motor neurons degenerate or die  and stop sending messages to muscles. The prevalence of ALS in western countries is fairly uniform at 6 per 100 000 persons  corresponding to around 30 000 cases in Europe and 20 000 in the USA. The first drug treatment for ALS  riluzole (Rilutek)  was approved in 1995. In Europe  there has been no new treatment approved since riluzole.About masitinibMasitinib is an orally administered tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets mast cells and macrophages  important cells for immunity  through inhibiting a limited number of kinases. Based on its unique mechanism of action  masitinib can be developed in a large number of conditions in oncology  in inflammatory diseases  and in certain diseases of the central nervous system. In oncology due to its immunotherapy effect  masitinib can have an effect on survival  alone or in combination with chemotherapy. Through its activity on mast cells and microglia and consequently the inhibition of the activation of the inflammatory process  masitinib can have an effect on the symptoms associated with some inflammatory and central nervous system diseases and the degeneration of these diseases.About AB ScienceFounded in 2001  AB Science is a pharmaceutical company specializing in the research  development and commercialization of protein kinase inhibitors (PKIs)  a class of targeted proteins whose action are key in signaling pathways within cells.

As the impact of the acquisition of TextileGenesis (see press release dated December 8  2022) on the financial statements for 2023 is not material  like-for-like changes exclude only the variations in exchange rates.SUMMARY FOR Q1 2023Strong decline in new system ordersAgainst the backdrop of slower global growth  persistent inflation  and rising interest rates  the first quarter of 2023 was marked by a wait-and-see attitude on the part of the Group's customers around the world with regard to their investment decisions. This situation is reflected in a sharp slowdown in new system orders.Orders for perpetual software licenses  equipment and accompanying software  and non-recurring services (35.7 million euros) were down 32%.Orders for new software subscriptions continued to rise. Their annual value came to 2.7 million euros  increasing by 13% compared to 2022 (+14% at actual exchange rates).Despite the low order intake  Q1 revenues in 2023 amounted to 123.7 million euros  stable compared to the same period of 2022  due to strong growth in revenues from recurring contracts  which benefited in particular from the growth in software subscription orders and the acceleration of synergies from the Gerber acquisition.EBITDA before non-recurring items totaled 19.7 million euros  down 12%  and the EBITDA margin before non-recurring items was 16.0%  down 2.1 percentage points.Income from operations before non-recurring items amounted to 12.1 million euros  down 20%. This included a 3.2-million-euro charge for amortization of intangible assets arising from the acquisitions carried out since 2021.Net income amounted to 7.3 million euros  down 21% at actual exchange rates.Free cash flow before non-recurring items came to 9.2 million euros  up 1.8 million euros compared to Q1 2022.A particularly robust balance sheetAt March 31  2023  the Group had a particularly robust balance sheet with a consolidated shareholders’ equity of 417.9 million euros and a positive net cash position of 7.8 million euros. In Q1  the Company paid 15.2 million euros in respect of the acquisition of the majority of the capital of TextileGenesis.The working capital requirement at March 31  2023 was a negative 5.0 million euros.BUSINESS TRENDS AND OUTLOOKIn its financial report on the third quarter and first nine months of 2022  published October 25  2022  Lectra reiterated its 4.0 strategy  initiated in 2017  and presented an assessment of the 2020-2022 roadmap  specifying that the progress made during the period  as well as the acquisitions of 2021  and the Gerber acquisition in particular  had given the Group a new dimension and increased opportunities for continued growth.Then  in its 2022 Financial Report  published February 8  2023  Lectra presented its new roadmap for 2023-2025.The Group also specified that 2023 remained unpredictable given the degraded macroeconomic and geopolitical environment  which lead to numerous uncertainties that could continue to weigh upon the investment decisions of its customers.The business activity and results in Q1 2023 confirmed this situation.Revised 2023 outlook due to wait-and-see attitude of customersAt the beginning of the year  the Group set itself objectives of achieving  in 2023  revenues in the range of 522 to 576 million euros and EBITDA before non-recurring items in the range of 90 to 113 million euros.

However  Vantiva confirms its full year guidance.Group’s revenues amounted to €573m in the quarter  up 2.5% (-0.6% at constant exchange rate).Connected Home contributed €458m  an increase of 12.1% (+8.7% at constant exchange rate).SCS contributed €115 million  a decrease of 23.3% (-25.4% at constant exchange rate).Vantiva continues to optimize productivity and efficiency across all activities.FY guidance is confirmed.Luis Martinez-Amago  Chief Executive Officer of Vantiva  said:“The environment continued to be challenging  as we had anticipated. Markets are showing some signs of softening  however our action plans are responding well to this situation and we keep executing our commercial plan. In this context  we are delighted with the performance of the Connected Home division this quarter. The DVD business in our Supply Chain Solutions division was impacted by a lack of new titles in the quarter. Nonetheless  at the group level  Vantiva remains on track to achieve its stated goals”.I- Q1 2023 RevenuesIn € million  continuing operations 2023 2022 Change at current rate Change at constant rate Revenues 573 559 2.5% -0.6%Q1 2023 Key Hi ghlightsThe 2.5% growth achieved in the quarter resulted from a contrasting performance of the two divisions. Connected Home benefited from continuing good demand for broadband and the division posted a 12.1% growth rate for the period. SCS  however  is facing a more challenging environment in the field of optical discs where demand declined during the quarter. SCS nevertheless continued and expanded its diversification activities and mitigated some of this decline  but revenues for the division were still down 23.3% in the quarter.OutlookThe group confirmed its guidance for the fiscal year 2023:EBITDA > €140mEBITA> € 45 mFCF(1) > €50m(1) Before interest and taxII- Q1 Segment ReviewConnected HomeRevenues breakdown by productIn € million 2023 2022 Change at current rate Change at constant rate Revenues 458 408 12.1% 8.7% o/w by product Broadband 381 322 18.2% 14.0% Video 77 86 -10.4% -10.9%Connected Home revenues represented 80% of group revenues in the quarter (73% in Q1 22) and totaled €458 million  up 12.1%. At constant exchange rate  the growth would have been 8.7% compared with Q1 2022. Beyond the positive effect of exchange rates  this development in revenue resulted from some growth in North American markets driven by cable and WiFi 6 CPEs  but also from double-digit growth in Europe and Latam. The increase in the latter regions is explained by better supply conditions  strong demand for broadband fiber products and business with new customers. On the other hand  demand for video equipment continued to suffer in Latam and India.Supply Chain SolutionsIn € million 2023 2022 Change at current rate Change at constant rate Revenues 115 150 -23.3% -25.4%Supply Chain Solutions’ revenues for the quarter represented 20% of Group revenues (27% in Q1 22) and totaled €115 million in the quarter  a 23.3% decrease compared to Q1 2022. At constant exchange rate the drop would have been 25.4%. This decline was due to the headwinds experienced by the mature optical discs business which was penalized by limited numbers of new releases from the major studios during the quarter  the reduction in DVDs inventories at some retailers and a less favorable economic environment overall. Diversification activities grew in line with expectations in the quarter. The division accelerated the implementation of productivity actions and diversification initiatives including investments in vinyl capacity extension.Corporate & OtherIn € million 2023 2022 Change at current rate Change at constant rate Revenues 0 1 nm nm###Warning: Forward Looking StatementsThis press release contains certain statements that constitute ""forward-looking statements""  including but not limited to statements that are predictions of or indicate future events  trends  plans or objectives  based on certain assumptions or which do not directly relate to historical or current facts.

The working day impact was favorable over the past quarter  standing at +1.5%.At the end of the fiscal year  Wavestone's consolidated revenue had reached €532.3m  an increase of +13%. At constant exchange rates  this amounts to €528.6m  in line with the objective of a consolidated revenue of over €525m.At constant scope and exchange rates  the firm's organic growth was +7% over the whole fiscal year (working day impact of -0.3%).Very solid recruitment over 2022/23; slowdown in staff turnoverWavestone maintained a very strong rate of recruitment throughout the 2022/23 fiscal year. Ultimately  the firm far exceeded its objective of recruiting more than 1 000 new employees.In parallel  the staff turnover rate continued to slow down toward the end of the year. It stands at 16% over the whole fiscal year  compared with 19% on a rolling 12-month basis at the midyear point  and 18% in 2021/22.At March 31  2023  the end of its 2022/23 fiscal year  Wavestone had 4 406 employees  including 126 from the acquisitions of Nomadéis  PEN Partnership and Coeus Consulting. This compares with 3 732 at the end of March 2022.In 2023  Wavestone was once again awarded the Great Place To Work ® label and  like last year  took first place in the ranking of companies in France with more than 2 500 employees. A global success  since Wavestone is now certified as a Great Place To Work ® for all of its offices  worldwide (see the press release of April 4  2023: Wavestone ranks 1st again in the 2023 Great Place to Work® France awards).Average sales prices up by +4% over the fiscal year and consultant utilization rate of 73%As announced  due to a slow start to the 2023 calendar year and the considerable number of new starters since September  the consultant utilization rate for Q4 was down sharply compared with the initial months of the fiscal year – standing at 71% (as a reminder: the utilization rate was 74% at the end of December 2022).Over the whole of the fiscal year  the consultant utilization rate was 73%  compared with 77% for 2021/22.The average daily rate reached €890 over the 2022/23 fiscal year – an increase of +4%  compared with the average sales price for the whole of the previous fiscal year (€854).At constant exchange rates  the average daily rate was €883  up +3%.2022/23 EBIT margin of 14.5%Wavestone's EBIT margin is 14.5% for the 2022/23 fiscal year (provisional data still to be audited). This figure is in line with the objective announced on March 8  2023  which included a degree of caution about the initial objective of 15%  due to the decline in consultant utilization rate in Q4.Outlook for the 2023/24 fiscal yearIn a business environment that is less buoyant overall  the first months of 2023 were marked by a more pronounced wait-and-see approach among clients in terms of committing to  and launching  new consulting projects – especially in France.While the situation remains difficult in the public sector  other business sectors  such as energy  the luxury-beauty sector  and financial services  continue to offer business development opportunities.After this slow start to the calendar year  order intake in March proved solid  enabling the firm to report an order book of 4.0 months of work at March 31  2023 – an identical figure to December 31  2022.The firm remains confident that it will continue to grow in the months to come  through an intense business-development activity focused on the most promising sectors. As a result  Wavestone is entering the 2023/24 fiscal year with the objective of achieving organic revenue growth at least equal to that of the fiscal year just ended.Regarding external growth  Wavestone intends to pursue its policy of targeted acquisitions in 2023/24  giving priority to the US but without ruling out tactical purchases elsewhere.Wavestone will share its financial objectives for the 2023/24 fiscal year on May 31  2023 – the date of publication of its 2022/23 annual results.Next event: publication of the 2022/23 annual results  Wednesday  May 31  2023  after Euronext market closing.About WavestoneIn a world where knowing how to drive transformation is key to success  Wavestone's mission is to inform and guide large organizations in their most critical transformations  with the aim of a positive outcome for all stakeholders.

The proposed stock warrants will be issued in a structure that cannot be disassociated from the large commercial contract announced today between SES-imagotag and Walmart. This contract is the largest contract ever signed by SES-imagotag over the course of its history and – subject to the validation of the following steps in this process  expected to be carried out over the coming months – it could total several billion dollars in revenue for SES-imagotag over the next five to seven years. Moreover  this contract enables optimal conditions for launching the next-generation “Digital Shelf System” solution  a major innovation which could lead to broad adoption by retailers after its deployment by Walmart. The SES-imagotag/Walmart contract will contribute to the successful execution of the VUSION '27 strategic plan.Given the scale of the value creation envisioned as a result of this contract  SES-imagotag considers that it is appropriate to include Walmart as a partner in this growth by granting them SES-imagotag stock warrants. These stock warrants would represent a maximum of 10% of SES-imagotag's total shareholders' equity over time  and the first tranche would become exercisable only after Walmart has purchased at least US$700m of SES-imagotag goods and services. Walmart would be able to reach a maximum 10% equity stake in SES-imagotag once its purchases of SES-imagotag goods and services has reached US$3bn. The strike price set for the options is € 112.19  equivalent to the volume weighted average share price of SES-imagotag over 90 days before the announcement of the contract. The stock warrants granted to Walmart cannot be disassociated from the commercial contract between Walmart and SES-imagotag.I am thoroughly convinced of the value creation that this operation represents for our company in the short and long term. On behalf of the Management Committee and the Board of Directors of SES-imagotag  I strongly recommend voting in favour of these resolutions on June 2  2023.”TimetableThe Company will convene and hold an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders on June 2  2023 to approve the issuance of the Warrants reserved to Walmart and the resulting new shares upon exercise of the Warrants.The draft resolutions submitted to the approval of the shareholders  the report of the Board of directors on such resolutions  the report of the Company's auditors and the other documents to be made available pursuant to applicable laws and regulations will be published on the Company's website at www.ses-imagotag.com/investors  on May 12  2023 at the latest.Summary terms of the WarrantsConversion Ratio: 1 Warrant entitles to subscribe to 1 newly issued ordinary share of the Company  with a par value of €2.00  subject to standard adjustments pursuant to French law.1 Warrant entitles to subscribe to 1 newly issued ordinary share of the Company  with a par value of €2.00  subject to standard adjustments pursuant to French law.

Accordingly  revenues fell sharply by 5% in the Off-Trade  due to disruptions that prevented the Group from meeting all customer demand  an adverse inventory effect among some customers and the postponement of promotional operations scheduled for Q1 until H2 2023. In the below 12-year blended whisky market  down 2.0%1 in terms of sales revenue  William Peel recorded a sharper decline. It is also worth noting the slowdown in consumer sales for Marie Brizard  Sobieski and Berger  while San José increased its market share despite the drop in sales. The Group is experiencing strong resilience among agency brands  driven by controlled promotional activity and targeted activation operations during the year’s high points.The On-Trade channel is thriving  posting Q1 2023 growth of 28% compared to the same period in 2022.International clusterThe International cluster posted first quarter 2023 revenues of €27.1m  up 30.3% versus 2022 at constant exchange rates.Spain saw an upswing of 63% over the quarter  bolstered by the branded business (up 6%) and strong momentum in subcontracting industrial services.In Western Europe export markets  the 11% drop in revenues is linked to the UK market  where the Marie Brizard brand continues to record a significant decline in distribution.Lithuania posted a strong 54% increase in revenues driven mainly by the branded business following price increases  reinvestment and related marketing initiatives. Domestic sales continued to rise  up 10% compared to 2022  mainly driven by the Bajoru regional vodka brand and despite a decline in local bulk sales. Export sales soared  driven by William Peel and the bulk segment.In Bulgaria  revenues rose sharply by 50%: Up 33% in the domestic market (William Peel and vodka category) and 63% in export markets (particularly subcontracting industrial services)  boosted by the price increases implemented in 2022 and early 2023.Scandinavia posted revenue growth of 10% in Q1  driven by Gautier and Marie Brizard  once again reflecting price increases and new listings.In the Eastern European export markets  sales in Poland were down 14% compared to 2022 (mainly Cognac Gautier and William Peel).In the United States  the 36% decrease in revenues was due to inventory rundown by our local importer and the low depletion rate following difficulties caused by the change in some routes to market in key states for the Sobieski brand and successive price increases in 2022 for Marie Brizard and Gautier.Indeed  changes made by our importer in some strategic regional routes to market have generated operational  logistical and commercial difficulties that have affected our brands’ performance. This was exacerbated by problems in the supply of glass for production destined for the North American market.Revenues rose in Brazil  mainly driven by local brands  the positive impact of significant price increases over the period and the ramp-up of a rigorous sales policy implemented at the end of 2022 in order to improve the subsidiary’s earnings.In the Americas export market  up slightly by 3%  Canada struggled  posting a significant decline in revenues year-on-year due to stock clearance among some major customers and tough competition in the vodka segment  partially offset by Cognac Gautier (up 11%) and Marie Brizard (up 19%).Lastly  Asia-Pacific revenues were down 15%  including a sharper decline in South Korea  due to shipment phasing during the period compared to a strong first quarter 2022.OutlookAfter a year 2022 marked by overall resilience in the face of availability and inflation constraints  the effects of supply disruptions and declining volumes in Q4 2022 also impacted the first quarter of 2023  particularly in France. However  Q1 revenue was boosted by the effects of significant international price increases in 2022 and Q1 2023. These price increases are intended to cushion the significant and persistent surges in input costs (particularly for energy and raw materials)  which have further increased in early 2023 (particularly for glassware)  but have only partially offset these effects at this stage.The Group is therefore entering a pivotal period during which it will have to closely monitor elasticity in consumer demand in the face of price increases  while managing the problems caused by disruptions in availability and logistics as well as possible. The Group proved its ability to adapt in 2022 and is working to remain on track despite these difficulties.Visibility remains low in some countries more heavily exposed to these elements  such as the concentrated and increasingly mature French market where volumes are in sharp decline. This persisting instability has prompted the Group to maintain a cautious approach regarding its short and medium-term business outlook.Financial calendarGeneral Meeting: 29/06/2023H1 2023 revenues: 27/07/2023Investors and shareholders relations contactGroupe MBWSEmilie Drexleremilie.drexler@mbws.comPhone: +33 1 43 91 62 40Press contactImage SeptClaire Doligez - Laurence Maurycdoligez@image7.fr – lmaury@image7.frPhone : +33 1 53 70 74 70About Marie Brizard Wine & SpiritsMarie Brizard Wine & Spirits is a Group of wines and spirits based in Europe and the United States.

The remaining €22 million (20 per cent) of the project's cost will be covered by Fulgor.The implementation of Fulgor's 2023-25 investment plan will support the company's ability to manufacture green infrastructure that fosters the energy transition towards a lower carbon economy and access to affordable clean energy sources. The project will unlock opportunities for Fulgor to participate in large interconnection projects and capture the envisaged growth in offshore wind energy installations.As part of the EBRD's support  the company's direct owner  Hellenic Cables  has agreed to undertake a number of initiatives  such as mentoring programmes  trainings and action plans to address gender gaps  which will strengthen its existing policy on female empowerment and gender equality. On the other hand  the loan will enable Hellenic Cables to further strengthen its role as a global player and key enabler of the transition to green energy. The investments will allow Cenergy Holding' cable segment to flawlessly execute an ever-increasing order backlog and serve the demanding requests of its customers and stakeholders.Jürgen Rigterink  EBRD First Vice President  stressed the importance of the transaction to the Bank: ""I am delighted to be signing this important transaction with Fulgor  member of Viohalco  our long-standing partner. Not only does this substantial investment specifically support Fulgor's production capacity and R&D capabilities  it also assists in the country's overall sustainabletransition by working to develop the offshore wind industry. This transaction combines green  gender and digital solutions - three of the EBRD's most important strategic priorities.""Theodoros Skylakakis  Alternate Minister of Finance of Greece  in charge of the implementation of the National Recovery and Resilience Plan  said: ""This €110 million investment for the production of underwater cable interconnections facilitates access to affordable sources of clean energy. The investment plan is implemented within the Greek RRF Co-Financing Framework. The loan part of the plan is one of the most successful development tools our country has ever had  as it provides loans at an extremely low interest rate to innovative businesses.""Nikos Mantzoufas  Governor of the Greek Recovery and Resilience Agency said: ""We are delighted about this investment of €110 million and the contribution of the RRF lending facility. Fulgor  an industrial production unit for the construction of submarine cables  is based in Korinthos  is set to create many highly skilled jobs and is being implemented by a company with significant export activity. It is thus further tangible proof of how the RRF is contributing to the strengtheningof our country's green technology productive export capacity.""Alexis Alexiou  Cenergy Holdings Chief Executive Officer  commented on the importance of the investment to Fulgor: ""The investment in Fulgor's capacity will allow Hellenic Cables to smoothly execute a very strong order backlog while at the same time get ready to meet the increase in demand for renewable infrastructure and the high expectations of all our stakeholders.

Photograph: Nick BradshawPaddy Power owner Flutter Entertainment cannot guarantee that its shares will continue to trade on the Irish Stock Exchange after it takes a secondary listing in New York.Shareholders have overwhelmingly backed the Wall Street move  mooted by the Irish gambling giant in February.Speaking after its annual general meeting in Dublin on Thursday  chairman Gary McGann said the group had “work to do” to allow it list in New York. These include preparing to meet US reporting requirements and overcoming complexities in dealing and settlement between the New York and Euronext Dublin markets. “That will take us to the year-end ” Mr McGann said.Asked if Flutter wanted to keep its Irish market listing  chief executive Peter Jackson responded “we cannot guarantee it”. However  he stressed that the group ideally wanted its shares to trade on all three markets.READ MOREFlutter would keep its primary listing in London and continue to work with Dublin Euronext  as the Irish market was now known  and New York  to work out the settlement difficulties  he said.The problem lies between Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation in the US and Euroclear in Europe  the companies that process share and other security transactions on the two markets.Why do some shareholders in the Republic's largest private residential landlord feel shortchanged? Listen | 40:06Mr McGann stressed that the group would remain Irish  pointing out that it was headquartered and tax domiciled in the Republic.Flutter  which grew from the merger of Irish bookie Paddy Power and British betting exchange  Betfair  has businesses in about 80 countries while the recently liberalised US is now its biggest market.Its main US business  FanDuel  is heading for profitability this year following almost half a decade of investment and development. The group believes the New York listing will help it attract more US investors anxious to cash in on FanDuel’s expansion.Mr McGann told shareholders on Thursday that Flutter calculated that the US sports betting market was worth about $40 billion (€36 billion) a year.Earlier Flutter announced that former Kellogg chief executive  John Bryant  would succeed Mr McGann as chairman in September.Well-known in corporate America  Mr Bryant is on the board of Coca Cola European Partners  department store chain Macy’s  where his tenure ends this month  caterer Compass Group and packager Ball Corporation. Previously Mr Bryant was chief executive and then executive chairman of cereal maker  Kellogg Company.He said he looked forward to working with Mr Jackson and Flutter’s management to grow the business.Mr McGann said it had been a privilege to chair Flutter as it developed. “The best is yet to come ” he told shareholders.

The company's oncology-focusedpipeline is designed to act on the tumor microenvironment (TME) and the cancer immunity cycle by breaking tumor protection barriers against the immune system and blocking tumor repair. By neutralizing chemokines in the TME  TME Pharma's approach works in combination with other forms of treatment to weaken tumor defenses and enable greater therapeutic impact. In the GLORIA clinical trial  TME Pharma is studying its lead drug candidate NOX-A12in newly diagnosed brain cancer patients who will not benefit clinically from standard chemotherapy. TME Pharma has delivered top-linedata from the NOX-A12three dose-escalationcohorts combined with radiotherapy of the GLORIA clinical trial  observing consistent tumor reductions and objective tumor responses. Additionally  GLORIA expansion arms evaluate safety and efficacy of NOX-A12in other combinations where the interim results from the triple combination of NOX-A12 radiotherapy and bevacizumab suggest even deeper and more durable responses. NOX-A12 in combination with radiotherapy has received orphan drug designation for glioblastoma in the United States and glioma in Europe. TME Pharma has delivered final top-linedata with encouraging overall survival and safety profile from its NOX-A12combination trial with Keytruda® in metastatic colorectal and pancreatic cancer patients  which was published in the Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer in October 2021. The company has entered in its second collaboration with MSD/Merck for its Phase 2 study  OPTIMUS  to further evaluate safety and efficacy of NOX-A12in combination with Merck's Keytruda® and two different chemotherapy regimens as second-linetherapy in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.

While inflation drives price increases  the higher revenue generated by retailers masks the decrease in volume sales  and the strong negative impact that current conditions are having on household purchasing power. The solutions we  at SES-imagotag  offer provide an answer to this particular quandary  enabling gains in productivity  agility and quality of execution  and in e-commerce revenues within the omnichannel model.The growing breadth of our portfolio of solutions  and especially the integration of Memory and Belive which we are currently undertaking  increasingly enable SES-imagotag to add more value to this crucial digital transformation  which will generate higher and accelerating ROI for retailers. With this contribution to our industry  we remain confident in our guidance for profitable growth for the year 2023 and the years to come.”Q1 2023 Sales grew +32% to €159mThe company's top-line increased by +32.5% in Q1 2023 versus the previous year to reach €159.3m. This growth includes the impact of the de-consolidation of the China JV which took place in Q4 2022. At constant perimeter  Q1 2023 top-line grew +39%.The revenue increase in the first quarter was driven by ongoing growth in Europe  with sales in the region increasing by +42.4% during the reporting period to €130.2m  fueled by dynamic growth in Germany. Top-line growth in the Rest of World (ROW) was +1.0% versus Q1 2022. Excluding the negative impact of the China JV de-consolidation  and on a like-for-like basis  sales in ROW grew by +27.1%  driven in particular by the Americas region which saw a top-line increase of 31% in the first quarter of 2023.On a 12-month rolling basis at end-March 2023  sales increased by +43.8% to €660m.Order EntriesOrder entries increased by +30% to €221m in Q1 2023  in-line with the quarter's sales growth.Software  Services and Non-ESL Solutions (VAS)Sales of software  services and non-ESL solutions (VAS) totaled €24.5m in Q1 2023  for year-on-year growth of +32%. VAS revenue was 15.4% of total in Q1 2023  compared to an average of 15% in 2022.The technical and operating integration of recently-acquired solutions (Memory  Belive) constitutes an area of specific focus and work in the first half of 2023. The aim is to launch these enhanced solutions quickly on the market and further accelerate VAS's growth trajectory.OutlookFor 2023  the order book and opportunities pipeline support a high-level of confidence in our top-line objective of €800m. Based on the favorable trend in component costs and forex  combined with the anticipated strong increase in VAS  the Group expects a significant increase in profitability.About SES-imagotag and the VUSION Retail IoT platformSES-imagotag is a world leader in smart digital labels and IoT solutions for physical retail  serving over 350 large retailer groups around the world in Europe  Asia and North America.SES-imagotag has developed the VUSION Retail IOT technology platform to help retailers transform their physical stores into high value digital assets  more automated  data-driven  and connected in real-time to suppliers and consumers.

The good performance at the beginning of the year  taking into account the usual seasonality of the first quarter and of major programs  comforts the growth target of the group.For the first time  Exail Technologies presents its revenues into two complementary and vertically integrated business segments:The Navigation & Maritime Robotics segment includes the group's two main activities  vertically integrated: the sale of navigation systems  positioning systems  and sonars; and the commercialization of drones and autonomous drone systems for maritime applications  integrating the group's navigation systems and other equipment in order to offer the most effective robotic solutions.This segment accounts for approximately 75% of the Group's revenues and 90% of its backlog.The Advanced Technologies segment consists of developing and selling the highest-performance photonic and quantum components (specialty optical fibers  optical modulators  quantum measurement instruments) and products using the most advanced technologies (on-board communication equipment  simulators  autonomous decision-making). These components and products are sold directly to third parties or integrated into the systems of the Navigation & Maritime Robotics segment.This segment represents approximately 25% of the group's revenues and 10% of its backlog.(in € million) Q1 2023 Q1 2022pro forma Q1 2022 restated[1] Var.

Deliveries of inertial navigation systems and progress on the various drones programs are well under control and on schedule. The level of revenues is similar to that of the first quarter of 2022. It is important to remember that the quarter-to-quarter comparison is not very relevant due to the uneven contribution of major projects during the year.Revenues for the quarter were driven in particular by the defense and marine energy sectors. In the defense sector  revenues included multiple deliveries of inertial navigation units and complete navigation systems. These sales were made directly to European  Asian and Middle Eastern navies as well as through major naval and land systems integrators. Revenues also include the progress of major underwater mine countermeasure programs underway  notably in Belgium  the Netherlands and Latvia.In the maritime operations sector  Exail Technologies equips numerous civilian operators  whether for their boats  drones or remotely operated robots. The dynamism of the market is driven by the growth of the sector in the United States and in the North Sea. In the latter area  many operators have chosen to equip themselves with Exail solutions to carry out their missions  such as the giant of the sector Van Oord or Fugro  the world's leading geo-data specialist.The North Sea Summit  which took place on April 24 in Ostend  Belgium  in the presence of nine heads of state and government  set the goal of ""making the North Sea the largest green energy power plant in Europe"". Exail's commercial presence and support services in the United Kingdom  Belgium  the Netherlands  Norway and northern Germany are key to capturing a share of this important market.The Advanced Technologies segment experienced very strong growth this quarter  driven in particular by photonic and quantum components. The market is booming and supports a record order book for a wide variety of applications  such as optical communications  lasers for scientific  industrial or medical use  space  quantum cryptography  metrology  etc. Sales of other equipment using advanced technologies (emergency beacons  simulators  test equipment) are also on track thanks to the good performance of the aeronautical sector and major orders won at the end of 2022.€56 million of order intake including some important contractsOrder intake for the first quarter amounted to €56 million  slightly below the level of the first quarter of 2022  which benefited from an annual price adjustment on the BENL contract  which this year should be recorded in the second quarter. This good level maintains a high backlog of €620 million.Significant orders worth several million euros each were won during the quarter in the Navigation & Maritime Robotics segment  strengthening Exail's position in its markets:The sale of a DriX surface drone  equipped with numerous on-board sensors  for a civilian customer in Europe in the field of oceanography. This sale in March was followed by a second one in early April for a customer in Asia-Pacific to perform survey missions.A major order for a large civil engineering project in Europe including acoustic positioning and inertial navigation solutions. Exail's products will enable the customer to reduce risks  increase accuracy and improve operational reliability.In the field of underwater mine countermeasures  an order for the development of new innovative functions for a European navy  which will strengthen the group's technological leadership in this field.In the space sector  a major pre-order for Astrix NS inertial units for a leading industrial player in the New Space sector.The performance of the first quarter enables Exail Technologies to achieve a good start to the year  which confirms the control over the execution of operations and the trends observed during the last months in our markets. The pace of deliveries should accelerate in the coming quarters thanks to the group's high order backlog. Exail Technologies thus confirms its 2023 guidance of revenue growth of over +15%.About Exail TechnologiesExail Technologies is the new name of Groupe Gorgé  adopted after the transformation of the group at the end of 2022  now focused on the activities of its subsidiary Exail.

In Europe  the Middle East & Africa region (EMEA)  the change in activity (-3% to €17.5 M) reflected a particularly demanding comparison basis  associated with the posting in late 2021 of a very significant order from a major European operator.By nature  licences & services have remained the primary source of revenue  totalling 51.6% in sales over the financial year  while the maintenance & SaaS segment  which includes the initial income from the broadpeak.io platform  increased by 36%  now representing 21.6% of overall sales. The contribution of equipment sales (26.8% over the financial year) returned to a normal level in the second half of the financial year (to 24.9% of revenue)  after an exceptionally high first half (29.9%) particularly associated with the preparations for the World Cup ® and the needs associated with new hardware.Net margin growth in the second halfPositive EBITDA for the yearThe gross margin came to €31.2 M over the year  representing 74.5% of revenue. As announced  it rose markedly in the second half of 2022 (to €19.9 M  or 77.1% of revenue) compared to the first half (€11.3 M  or 70.6% of revenue). This anticipated change is directly linked to the normalising of the contribution of equipment sales between the two periods.EBIDTA totalled €0.6 M for the year. In line with the stated objective of maintaining a positive EBITDA  this level included the expenses needed to step up the acquisition of market share. Personnel expenses thus rose by 29.1%  to €20 M  following the increase in resources. In one year  the Broadpeak workforce increased from 241 to 312  including external contractors. The growth in external contractor services is reflected through the increase in other operating expenses (+56.9%)  also associated with the marketing and sales investments due to the 2022 return of large international trade shows.The operating result totalled -€1.6 M (compared to +€1.35 M in 2021)  after posting €2.2 M in interest  depreciation  and amortisation  an amount whose increase (+33.5%) reflects a sustained investment policy  resulting in an increase in R&D expenses invested.The net earning amounted €1.4 M  after recognition of a research tax credit (CIR) of €3.9 M (vs. €2.9 M in 2021).A solid financial structureAs of 31 December 2022  equity totalled €28 M  versus €8.3 M one year earlier  thanks to the net proceeds from the capital increase conducted at the occasion of the IPO  in the amount of €18.3 M. Financial debt was reduced by over half in one year  to €5.9 M (vs. €13.7 M at the end of 2021). The establishment of a factoring agreement resulted in a contraction of the accounts receivable item (-33%) and a marked improvement in the Group's working capital requirement (WCR).Despite the sustained investment and substantial debt reduction  cash burn remained contained: free cash flow totalled -€2.5 M for the year (vs. -€2.6 in 2021). As of 31 December 2022  the Group had a cash position of €10.8 M.In 2022  Broadpeak steered a steady course on the strategic roadmap unveiled at the time of its IPO. The Group continued its policy of ongoing innovation  which resulted in particular in the December launch of the BkS450 software; this disruptive solution meets the growing environmental expectations surrounding digital  with high-performance streaming consuming up to four times less energy than the preceding generation. In parallel  the broadpeak.io platform (SaaS offering)  launched in early 2022  was enriched throughout the year with new advanced applications (Content replacement  Virtual channel  Dynamic ad insertion).Such advances in technology maintained a strong commercial momentum. In 2022  Broadpeak managed to accelerate the development of earnings over its installed customer base  all while leading a record conquest  carried by the success of the CDN  Cloud PVR  and Multicast ABR offers  as well as by the first items in the SaaS offer. Overall  the Group's portfolio was enriched by 27 new references  for 152 clients in late 2022.Roadmap for 2026 confirmedSince early 2023  this commercial momentum has continued  in particular with the Group seeing an acceleration of orders for the SaaS offers (broadpeak.io) and Multicast ABR as well as the promising beginnings for the new “Advanced CDN” version launched in April.In a streaming market still carried by the explosion of video content and minimally exposed to cyclical developments  Broadpeak is confident in its capacity to pursue a trajectory of sustained growth in 2023. This trajectory will be more dynamic starting in Q2  as the start of the year was marked by the few-week lag of a significant order. The solid growth expected over the entire financial year should be accompanied by an increase in EBITDA over its 2022 level.Over the longer term  Broadpeak is renewing the roadmap presented to investors at the time of its IPO. By 2026  the Group is targeting €100 M in revenue  combined with an EBITDA margin of 20%. Powered by the acceleration of the broadpeak.io platform  the share of recurring revenue (maintenance and SaaS) is expected to reach 40% over this timeframe.Upcoming events:Q1 2023 revenue: 16 May 2023  after market closeH1 2023 revenue: 25 July 2023  after market closeCONTACTSBROADPEAK FINANCIAL COMMUNICATION FINANCIAL / CORPORATE PRESS Investors@broadpeak.tv broadpeak@actifin.fr michael.scholze@actifin.fr + 33(0)2 22 74 03 50 + 33(0)1 56 88 11 25 + 33(0)1 56 88 11 14Broadpeak  S.A. - Zone des champs blancs  15 rue Claude Chappe  35 510 Cesson-Sévigné  FranceVAT Number FR49 524 473 063 – SIREN 524 473 063 00054avec un capital social de 250.615 60 eurosTel: +33 (0)2 22 74 03 50About Broadpeak,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,positive,0.77,0.22,0.01,True,English,"['annual results', 'BROADPEAK SA', 'large international trade shows', 'video streaming software solutions', 'French Regulatory News', 'Jacques Le Mancq', 'intense R&D', 'exceptional user experience', 'constant exchange rates', 'demanding comparison basis', 'major European operator', 'Advanced CDN’ solution', 'Research Tax Credit', 'positive Forex effect', 'R&D expenses', 'sustained investment policy', 'unparalleled environmental performance', 'solid financial structure', 'other operating expenses', 'high first half', 'external contractor services', 'broadpeak.io platform', 'Net margin growth', 'streaming solution', 'external contractors', 'Solid growth', 'Gross margin', 'Operating profit', 'Net income', 'Personnel expenses', 'net earning', 'net proceeds', '2026 financial targets', 'Financial debt', 'annual results', 'Cesson-Sévigné', 'leading provider', 'positive EBITDA', 'successful launch', 'SaaS offering', 'latest generation', 'monetisation opportunities', 'biggest market', 'Middle East', 'Africa region', 'primary source', 'SaaS segment', 'initial income', 'second half', 'World Cup ®', 'new hardware', 'two periods', 'market share', 'Euronext Growth', 'internal growth', 'financial year', 'operating result', 'sales teams', 'overall sales', 'equipment sales', 'sales investments', 'one year', 'Sales growth', 'financial objectives', 'Asia zones', 'significant order', 'normal level', 'BROADPEAK SA', 'EQS Group', 'CIR amount2', 'sales momentum', 'capital increase', 'revenue growth', 'Broadpeak workforce', '1 EBITDA', '2 CIR', '18:00 CET', 'CEST', 'Dissemination', 'issuer', 'content', 'announcement', 'EBIDTA', 'line', 'terms', 'technology', 'France', '27 April', 'Ticker', 'ALBPK', '31 December', 'CEO', 'commitments', 'investors', 'time', 'IPO', 'place', 'phase', 'start', 'FY', 'release', 'clients', 'innovations', 'confidence', 'EBITDA1', 'Earnings', 'Interest', 'Depreciation', 'Amortisation', 'Americas', 'rise', 'dollar', 'positions', 'EMEA', 'activity', 'posting', 'nature', 'licences', 'maintenance', 'contribution', 'preparations', 'needs', 'normalising', 'acquisition', 'resources', 'marketing', '2022 return', 'recognition', 'equity', 'occasion']",2023-04-27,2023-04-28,marketscreener.com

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance.

We are particularly pleased with the strong momentum in France  the dynamism in Europe  the return to growth in Asia and the resilience of our sales in America after an excellent 2022. This quarter also saw the progress in the implementation of our ambitious CSR strategy with the acceleration of the full-traceability project roll-out on brand collections  the launch of Sandro clothing rental in the UK and the launch of our SMCP Retail Lab training school. We remain vigilant regarding the evolution of the macro-economic  social  and geopolitical context but are confident that the positive momentum will continue in the coming quarters and thus confirm our annual targets.”€m except %Unaudited figures Q1 2022 Q1 2023 Organicchange Reportedchange Constant Fx change Sales by regionFrance 93.7 106.0 +13.1% +13.1% +13.1% EMEA 83.1 88.6 +7.0% +6.6% +7.0% America 38.6 39.0 -2.5% +1.0% -2.5% APAC 67.6 71.0 +2.7% +5.1% +6.9% Sales by brand Sandro 134.1 146.0 +7.8% +8.9% +8.9% Maje 112.2 113.8 +0.4% +1.5% +1.5% Other brands1 36.8 44.8 +21.8% +21.7% +21.9% TOTAL 283.0 304.6 +6.7% +7.6% +7.6%SALES BY REGIONIn France  sales reached a record level of €106m in the first quarter  with an organic growth of +13% compared to 2022. They were mainly driven by the performance of the like-for-like network and by the demand of local and tourist customers  who are increasingly numerous both in physical shops and on the brands' websites. This double-digit growth is even more remarkable given the high basis of comparison in 2022 and the adverse social environment. The “Other brands” division (Claudie Pierlot and Fursac) recorded a strong momentum in the quarter. The Group also carried on its strategy of reducing the average discount rate  particularly in digital. The network is decreasing by four POS including the closure of the remaining two Suite 341 stores.In EMEA  the Group maintained a very good momentum with a robust growth despite a high basis of comparison. Sales reached €89m  +7% on an organic basis vs 2022 with a strong retail like-for-like growth of +15% from both B&M and digital sales. The good performance of the largest markets such as the United Arab Emirates  Italy and Spain was partially offset by the end of the wholesale partnership in Russia (last deliveries in February 2022). The average discount rate registered a slight decrease which comes from digital. The network is down by seven POS in Q1 excluding the impact of Russia (40 POS).In America  after an outstanding performance in 2022  sales are stabilizing in reported change and decreasing by -3% on an organic basis. During the first quarter  sales in the US were resilient with a positive like-for-like growth in B&M. The slightly unfavorable trend comes from Canada where the normalization of traffic is slower due to the low level of tourism from Asia and weak local demand. The network is down by two POS.In APAC  the growth is progressively back in the region  with €71m of sales in Q1  +3% on an organic basis vs 2022. The trend gradually improved in Mainland China over the quarter with January and February still affected by low traffic  before returning to growth in March. The region benefits from a good performance in Hong-Kong  Singapore  Malaysia and Macau and the integration of Australia and New-Zealand in our own retail network. The average discount rate decreased by more than four points with the normalization of the situation after the Covid constraints. Finally  the network continued to expand with five openings  particularly in China and Singapore.CONCLUSION AND PERSPECTIVESThanks to the strong desirability of its brands  the Group records a good performance in the first quarter.Subject to the evolution of the macro-economic  social  and geopolitical situation  SMCP confirms its financial guidance for 2023.OTHER INFORMATIONSAt its meeting of March 23  2023  the Board of Directors decided to create a Sustainability committee  which will be responsible for monitoring the consideration of social  societal  and environmental responsibility issues when defining the Group’s strategy and its implementation.FINANCIAL CALENDARJune 21st  2023 – Annual shareholders meetingJuly 27th  2023 – 2023 Half-Year ResultsA conference call with investors and analysts will be held today by CEO Isabelle Guichot and CFO Patricia Huyghues Despointes  from 9:00 a.m. (Paris time).Related slides will also be available on the website (www.smcp.com)  in the Finance section.APPENDICESBreakdown of DOSNumber of DOS Q1-22 2022 Q1-23 vs.2022 vs.Q1 2022 By region France 459 460 456 -4 -3 EMEA 395 395 391 -4 -4 America 165 166 164 -2 -1 APAC 251 259 305 +46 +54 By brand Sandro 541 551 569 +18 +28 Maje 451 457 476 +19 +25 Claudie Pierlot 209 201 203 +2 -6 Suite 341 3 2 - -2 -3 Fursac 66 69 68 -1 +2 Total DOS 1 270 1 280 1 316 +36 +46Breakdown of POSNumber of POS Q1-22 2022 Q1-23 vs.2022 vs.Q1 2022 By region France 460 461 457 -4 -3 EMEA 545 552 505 -47 -40 America 195 198 196 -2 +1 APAC 467 472 477 +5 +10 By brand Sandro 736 752 733 -19 -3 Maje 618 627 611 -16 -7 Claudie Pierlot 244 233 223 -10 -21 Suite 341 3 2 - -2 -3 Fursac 66 69 68 -1 +2 Total POS 1 667 1 683 1 635 -48 -32 o/w Partners POS 397 403 319 -84 -78FINANCIAL INDICATORS NOT DEFINED IN IFRSNumber of points of sale (POS)The number of the Group’s points of sale comprises total retail points of sale open at the relevant date  which includes (i) directly operated stores (DOS)  including free-standing stores  concessions in department stores  affiliate-operated stores  outlets and online stores  and (ii) partnered retail points of sale.Organic sales growthOrganic sales growth is the total sales in a given period compared to the same period in the previous year.

We are particularly pleased with the strong momentum in France  the dynamism in Europe  the return to growth in Asia and the resilience of our sales in America after an excellent 2022. This quarter also saw the progress in the implementation of our ambitious CSR strategy with the acceleration of the full-traceability project roll-out on brand collections  the launch of Sandro clothing rental in the UK and the launch of our SMCP Retail Lab training school. We remain vigilant regarding the evolution of the macro-economic  social  and geopolitical context but are confident that the positive momentum will continue in the coming quarters and thus confirm our annual targets.”€m except %Unaudited figures Q1 2022 Q1 2023 Organicchange Reportedchange Constant Fx change Sales by regionFrance 93.7 106.0 +13.1% +13.1% +13.1% EMEA 83.1 88.6 +7.0% +6.6% +7.0% America 38.6 39.0 -2.5% +1.0% -2.5% APAC 67.6 71.0 +2.7% +5.1% +6.9% Sales by brand Sandro 134.1 146.0 +7.8% +8.9% +8.9% Maje 112.2 113.8 +0.4% +1.5% +1.5% Other brands1 36.8 44.8 +21.8% +21.7% +21.9% TOTAL 283.0 304.6 +6.7% +7.6% +7.6%SALES BY REGIONIn France  sales reached a record level of €106m in the first quarter  with an organic growth of +13% compared to 2022. They were mainly driven by the performance of the like-for-like network and by the demand of local and tourist customers  who are increasingly numerous both in physical shops and on the brands' websites. This double-digit growth is even more remarkable given the high basis of comparison in 2022 and the adverse social environment. The “Other brands” division (Claudie Pierlot and Fursac) recorded a strong momentum in the quarter. The Group also carried on its strategy of reducing the average discount rate  particularly in digital. The network is decreasing by four POS including the closure of the remaining two Suite 341 stores.In EMEA  the Group maintained a very good momentum with a robust growth despite a high basis of comparison. Sales reached €89m  +7% on an organic basis vs 2022 with a strong retail like-for-like growth of +15% from both B&M and digital sales. The good performance of the largest markets such as the United Arab Emirates  Italy and Spain was partially offset by the end of the wholesale partnership in Russia (last deliveries in February 2022). The average discount rate registered a slight decrease which comes from digital. The network is down by seven POS in Q1 excluding the impact of Russia (40 POS).In America  after an outstanding performance in 2022  sales are stabilizing in reported change and decreasing by -3% on an organic basis. During the first quarter  sales in the US were resilient with a positive like-for-like growth in B&M. The slightly unfavorable trend comes from Canada where the normalization of traffic is slower due to the low level of tourism from Asia and weak local demand. The network is down by two POS.In APAC  the growth is progressively back in the region  with €71m of sales in Q1  +3% on an organic basis vs 2022. The trend gradually improved in Mainland China over the quarter with January and February still affected by low traffic  before returning to growth in March. The region benefits from a good performance in Hong-Kong  Singapore  Malaysia and Macau and the integration of Australia and New-Zealand in our own retail network. The average discount rate decreased by more than four points with the normalization of the situation after the Covid constraints. Finally  the network continued to expand with five openings  particularly in China and Singapore.CONCLUSION AND PERSPECTIVESThanks to the strong desirability of its brands  the Group records a good performance in the first quarter.Subject to the evolution of the macro-economic  social  and geopolitical situation  SMCP confirms its financial guidance for 2023.OTHER INFORMATIONSAt its meeting of March 23  2023  the Board of Directors decided to create a Sustainability committee  which will be responsible for monitoring the consideration of social  societal  and environmental responsibility issues when defining the Group’s strategy and its implementation.FINANCIAL CALENDARJune 21st  2023 – Annual shareholders meetingJuly 27th  2023 – 2023 Half-Year ResultsA conference call with investors and analysts will be held today by CEO Isabelle Guichot and CFO Patricia Huyghues Despointes  from 9:00 a.m. (Paris time).Related slides will also be available on the website (www.smcp.com)  in the Finance section.APPENDICESBreakdown of DOSNumber of DOS Q1-22 2022 Q1-23 vs.2022 vs.Q1 2022 By region France 459 460 456 -4 -3 EMEA 395 395 391 -4 -4 America 165 166 164 -2 -1 APAC 251 259 305 +46 +54 By brand Sandro 541 551 569 +18 +28 Maje 451 457 476 +19 +25 Claudie Pierlot 209 201 203 +2 -6 Suite 341 3 2 - -2 -3 Fursac 66 69 68 -1 +2 Total DOS 1 270 1 280 1 316 +36 +46Breakdown of POSNumber of POS Q1-22 2022 Q1-23 vs.2022 vs.Q1 2022 By region France 460 461 457 -4 -3 EMEA 545 552 505 -47 -40 America 195 198 196 -2 +1 APAC 467 472 477 +5 +10 By brand Sandro 736 752 733 -19 -3 Maje 618 627 611 -16 -7 Claudie Pierlot 244 233 223 -10 -21 Suite 341 3 2 - -2 -3 Fursac 66 69 68 -1 +2 Total POS 1 667 1 683 1 635 -48 -32 o/w Partners POS 397 403 319 -84 -78FINANCIAL INDICATORS NOT DEFINED IN IFRSNumber of points of sale (POS)The number of the Group’s points of sale comprises total retail points of sale open at the relevant date  which includes (i) directly operated stores (DOS)  including free-standing stores  concessions in department stores  affiliate-operated stores  outlets and online stores  and (ii) partnered retail points of sale.Organic sales growthOrganic sales growth is the total sales in a given period compared to the same period in the previous year.

Our backlog continued to grow during the quarter  with awards in both subsea and offshore wind  and bidding remains very active in both businesses. The sustained high level of demand from our clients supports our view of a return to an Adjusted EBITDA margin range of 15-20% in the coming four years. While this year marks a period of re-investment in both the subsea and renewables businesses  we are confident that our strategy positions the Group for strong cash generation  and the return of excess capital to shareholders  next year and beyond.Notably  during the quarter we largely completed installation of the $1.2 billion fast-track Sakarya project in Türkiye and the development achieved first gas in April. After just 31 months since the initial gas discovery by the client  the project is testament to the strong and successful collaboration both with Turkish Petroleum and with SLB  our alliance partner in Subsea Integration Alliance. This ambitious schedule  in a new country for Subsea7  was led by our project management team in Istanbul  and drew on the expertise of engineers in France  the UK  Malaysia and Australia  as well as utilising vessels including Seven Arctic  Seven Oceanic and Seven Pegasus.Overall  Subsea7 delivered a satisfactory financial performance in the first quarter and we are confident in the outlook for the remainder of the year and beyond.Operational highlightsDuring the first quarter the Subsea and Conventional business unit experienced normal seasonality due to winter conditions in most of the Northern Hemisphere. Seven Oceanic  Seven Pacific  Seven Sisters and Seven Vega were active on Sakarya in Türkiye  Bacalhau in Brazil and Sangomar in Senegal. Seven Oceans was active in the Gulf of Mexico before transiting to Norway where it prepared for work on the Northern Lights carbon capture project. In the UK  against a backdrop of fiscal uncertainty  our fleet of diving support vessels achieved reduced utilisation due to the postponement of activities by clients.In the Renewables business unit Seaway Aimery and Seaway Moxie worked on the cable lay scope of Hollandse Kust Zuid in the Netherlands. Seaway Strashnov was in dry dock  as planned  for most of the first quarter and resumed operations on Dogger Bank A&B at the end of March. We also resumed activity at Seagreen and the final jacket was installed mid-April.First quarter financial reviewRevenue of $1.2 billion increased 4% compared to the prior year period reflecting strong growth of 18% in Subsea and Conventional  partially offset by a decline in Renewables due to the phasing of the Seagreen project. Adjusted EBITDA of $107 million equated to an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 8.6%  up from 7.2% in Q1 2022. After depreciation and amortisation charges of $122 million  net operating loss improved to $15 million from a loss of $31 million in the prior year period. After net finance costs of $8 million and without the benefit of the prior year’s tax credit  net loss for the quarter increased to $29 million compared to a net loss of $12 million in Q1 2022.Net cash used in operations was $127 million including a $209 million anticipated increase in net working capital. Net cash used in investing activities was $86 million while net cash generated by financing activities was $256 million which included $300 million proceeds from borrowings. Overall  cash and cash equivalents increased by $40 million from 31 December 2022 to $686 million at 31 March 2023. Net debt at the end of the first quarter was $419 million including lease liabilities of $456 million.First quarter order intake was $1.9 billion comprising new awards of $1.2 billion and escalations of $0.7 billion resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.5x. Backlog at the end of March was $9.7 billion  of which $4.0 billion is expected to be executed in 2023 and $3.4 billion in 2024.Outlook – full year 2023 on trackWe continue to expect revenue and Adjusted EBITDA in 2023 to be higher than 2022  with a weighting towards the second half of the year. Pricing and contract terms continued to improve during the first quarter and recent awards  as well as ongoing tenders  support our view that Adjusted EBITDA margins should trend back to a range of 15-20% over the coming four years. This is approaching the margin necessary to yield an appropriate return on capital employed.Conference Call InformationDate: 27 April 2023Time: 12:00 UK TimeAccess the webcast at subsea7.com or https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/obrzwjppRegister for the conference call at https://register.vevent.com/register/BI835ccb83027d4b0291b319f2cd431b57For further information  please contact:Katherine TonksHead of Investor RelationsEmail: ir@subsea7.comTelephone: +44 20 8210 5568Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking StatementsCertain statements made in this announcement may contain ‘forward-looking statements’ (within the meaning of the safe harbour provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995).
