Business income improved through the quarter to reach a record EUR 414 million  an increase of 2% year-on-year.The Euroclear group's business model provides a hedge against market volatility. When equity markets are lower  the impact is mitigated by the group's diversified and subscription-like business model  and we benefit in a similar vein when bond markets are weaker  as approximately three quarters of the group's business income is decoupled from financial market valuations. Such that  in the recent market environment  when both equity valuations and transaction volumes have been low  any potential impact to us has been mitigated by those operating entities which have a greater relative weighting to the bond markets  which saw business income grow.Over a three-year period  underlying business income has grown 9% CAGR  reflecting the robust growth delivered by the strategy through volatile financial market conditions.Since last year  the interest rate environment has changed dramatically. This has resulted in a large increase in interest earnings due to rising interest rates on cash balances. On an underlying basis  Q1 2023 interest  banking and other income increased by 871% to EUR 237 million because of rising interest rates.Euroclear is investing in its strategy  leading to underlying operating expenses increasing to EUR 307 million  up 19% compared to the prior year.Approximately 10% of the increase in underlying operating expenses is due to inflation on costs  with the remainder reflecting continued investments in its technology and service offering  as well as one-off projects. The investments in Euroclear's technology aim at enhancing Euroclear's client proposition  business resilience  and to increase efficiency through standardisation and modernisation.Euroclear continues to expect expenditure to remain above its 'through-the-cycle' target of 4-6% p.a. throughout 2023  due to accelerating investment in both its strategy and the resilience of the business  coupled with continued inflationary pressures on the cost base. Excluding the impact of inflation and one-off expenditures  Euroclear's Q1 expense profile is broadly in line with the top end of the through-the-cycle range.Nevertheless  profitability has continued to rise  as expected  as inflation headwinds have been more than offset by higher net interest income from subsequent rate increases. The group's underlying EBITDA margin was 57% in the first quarter  a level which is amongst the industry leaders in the financial market infrastructure sector.On an underlying basis  earnings per share almost doubled  up 95% to EUR 81.4 per share.The group maintains a strong capital position and a low-risk profile  which are critical as a financial market infrastructure and create headroom for further growth.Navigating a Challenging Operating Environment while Delivering Euroclear's Growth StrategyFollowing a year in which financial markets experienced negative returns from both equities and fixed income for the first time in over 50 years  activity levels in the first quarter were relatively muted  with low levels of Initial Public Offerings in equity markets and an absence of M&A activity as a driver of capital market operations. Despite this  Euroclear has continued to grow its business income  demonstrating the resilience of its business model and the continued progress in its client-centric strategy.Fixed income markets improved through the quarter  however equities remained volatile which has impacted the group entities and products  such as funds  where there is higher equity exposure. In addition  the higher interest rate environment has reduced demand for some product lines  such as in tri-party securities lending.Euroclear has closely monitored the recent disruption in the banking sector  taking necessary actions to ensure its resilience and support clients where appropriate. The volatility resulted in higher transaction volumes in March at a similar level to last year  following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.In addition  following the market-wide application of sanctions related to Russia  Euroclear continues to comply in its role as financial market infrastructure. See ""Implications of Russian sanctions""  below  for more details.The consequence of the operating environment is shown below in the group's key operating metrics:Q1 2023 Change vs Q1 2022 3-year CAGR Assets under Custody EUR 36.4 trillion -1 % 7.4 % Number of transactions 80 million 0 % 3.3 % Turnover (Value of transactions processed) EUR 275 trillion +1 % 6.6 % Fund assets under custody EUR 2.9 trillion -4 % 11.1 % Collateral Highway EUR 1.7 trillion -12 % 5.7 %At the same time  Euroclear has continued to deliver on its five-year growth strategy and strives towards its ambitious long-term vision to build a digital and data-enabled financial market infrastructure.In line with this vision  Euroclear recently announced a collaboration with Tradeweb and Informa Global Markets to automate the identification and setup process for newly issued Eurobond securities in the primary market. The initiative is expected to reduce cost and risk to the investor community by providing quicker access to reliable deal information.Consistent with its strategy  Euroclear is now exploring further opportunities as it continues the integration of MFEXbyEuroclear to build a compelling proposition for funds services. This includes services in private markets assets  where Euroclear has announced its intention to acquire Goji  a UK-based FinTech (subject to regulatory approvals).A further innovation was delivered in the Negotiable European Commercial Paper Market as Euroclear France opened its services to Italian issuers for the first time. By using the service  Unicredit became the first issuer to access the second largest short-term funding market in Europe.Implications of Russian sanctionsRussia's invasion of Ukraine resulted in market-wide application of international sanctions  which had a material impact on Euroclear's financial market infrastructure. Well established processes are in place which have allowed the group to implement the sanctions while maintaining the normal course of business.There is  however  additional complexity because the package of sanctions is wide-ranging and  moreover  Russia does not recognise the international sanctions and has implemented its own economic countermeasures. Euroclear maintains regular dialogue with clients and other impacted stakeholders in managing the market issues and implications of Russian countermeasures.The international sanctions and Russian countermeasures resulted in a loss of activities from sanctioned clients and Russian securities which impacted business income. However  it has been more than offset by increased interest income.The cash on the balance sheet has increased as blocked coupon payments and redemptions accumulate. At the end of March 2023  Euroclear Bank's balance sheet had increased by EUR 88 billion year-on-year to a total of EUR 140 billion.As per Euroclear's standard process  which is the same for any client's long cash balances  the cash balances arising from the sanctions are invested to minimise credit risk. Over Q1 2023  interest arising on cash balances from Russia-sanctioned assets was EUR 734 million.Future earnings linked to the sanctions will continue to depend on the prevailing interest rate environment and the evolution of the sanctions. The Board expects interest income to continue to grow as blocked payments and redemptions continue to accumulate  albeit at a slower pace during 2023.As previously outlined  while the Russian sanctions materially impact the balance sheet  the impact on the group's capital ratios is not expected to be significant. Euroclear maintains a strong capital position.The nature of the activities undertaken as a financial market infrastructure has led various parties to contest the sanctions and countermeasures  as well as their application  with legal proceedings ongoing in both the European Union and Russia. At present these legal proceedings are not presently considered a material risk and have not incurred any financial impact.Furthermore  Euroclear notes that analysis is being undertaken by the European Commission to consider the potential generation of resources to support Ukraine from reinvestment of immobilised Russian assets.Since considerable uncertainties persist  the Board considers it necessary to separate the sanction-related earnings from the underlying financial results when assessing the company's performance and resources.Euroclear continues to act in a transparent manner with all authorities involved. The Board will continue to act cautiously by not distributing any profits related to the Russian sanctions until the situation becomes clearer.AnnexesEuroclear Bank and Euroclear Investments are the two group issuing entities.

Should any of the three largest shareholders renounce its right to appoint one representative to the nomination committee  such right shall transfer to the shareholder who then in turn  after these three  is the largest shareholder in the company. The Board of Directors shall convene the nomination committee. The member representing the largest shareholder shall be appointed chairman of the nomination committee  unless the nomination committee unanimously appoints someone else.Should a shareholder having appointed a representative to the nomination committee no longer be among the three largest shareholders at a point in time falling three months before the annual general meeting at the latest  the representative appointed by such shareholder shall resign and the shareholder who is then among the three largest shareholders shall have the right to appoint one representative to the nomination committee. Unless there are specific reasons otherwise  the already established composition of the nomination committee shall  however  remain unchanged in case such change in the ownership is only marginal or occurs during the three month period prior to the annual general meeting.

Should a member resign from the nomination committee before his or her work is completed  the shareholder who has appointed such member shall appoint a new member  unless that shareholder is no longer one of the three largest shareholders  in which case the largest shareholder in turn shall appoint the substitute member. A shareholder who has appointed a representative to the nomination committee shall have the right to discharge such representative and appoint a new representative.Changes to the composition of the nomination committee shall be announced immediately. The term of office for the nomination committee ends when the next nomination committee has been appointed. The nomination committee shall carry out its duties as set out in the Swedish Code of Corporate Governance.Item 17 – Resolution to amend the articles of associationThe Board of Directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to amend the articles of association as follows:An update of § 4 is proposed  whereby the limits for the share capital and the number of shares are increased in order to enable registration of more number of shares. In addition  a new section is proposed  § 11  which authorizes the Board of Directors to resolve that persons not being shareholders shall be allowed to attend general meetings.Following the insertion of a new section  a renumbering of sections is proposed  whereby the previous § 11 becomes § 12 and so on.Current wording Proposed wording 4 § Share capital and number of sharesThe share capital shall be not less than SEK 710 000 and not morethan SEK 2 840 000. The number of shares shall be not less than17 750 000 and not more than 71 000 000./…/ 4 § Share capital and number of sharesThe share capital shall be not less than SEK 1 000 000 and not morethan SEK 4 000 000.

Such share issue resolution may be carried out with or without deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights and with or without provisions for contribution in kind  set-off or other conditions. The authorization may only be utilized to such extent that the number of shares issued by virtue of the authorization  or the number of shares created in connection with exercise of warrants or conversion of convertibles  together with any ordinary shares transferred by virtue of the authorization under item 19 below (provided that the annual general meeting resolves in accordance with the proposal)  in aggregate does not exceed 20 percent of the total number of ordinary shares issued at the time of the general meeting's resolution on the proposed authorization  calculated after full exercise of the hereby proposed authorization.The purpose of the authorization is to increase the financial flexibility of the company and the general flexibility of the Board of Directors. Should the Board of Directors resolve on an issue with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  the reason for this shall be to finance an acquisition of operations  to procure capital to finance the development of projects  repayments of loans or to commercialize the company' s products. Upon such deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  the new issue shall be made at market terms and conditions.The CEO shall be authorized to make such minor adjustments to this resolution that may be necessary in connection with the registration thereof.Item 19 – Resolution to authorize the Board of Directors to resolve on transfer of own ordinary sharesIn 2022  Calliditas Therapeutics had a so called At-The-Market program (""ATM Program"") in place  directed towards the US market. In order to facilitate for the implementation of the ATM program  the annual general meeting 2022 adopted resolutions whereby  among other things  a new class of shares (C-shares) was introduced in the articles of association and the Board of Directors was authorized to resolve on the issue  repurchase and transfer of 5 908 019 C-shares after conversion to ordinary shares. On 20 June 2022  the board of directors resolved by virtue of the authorizations to issue and repurchase 5 908 019 C-shares as well as to convert the C-shares to ordinary shares  which the company has held in treasury since. The company does not intend to carry forward with the ATM program  meaning that the program will be terminated without any of the 5 908 019 ordinary shares being exercized  and as a complement to the proposal to authorize the Board of Directors to resolve on issue of new shares  warrants and/or convertibles in accordance with item 18 above  the Board of Directors therefore proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to authorize the Board of Directors to resolve on transfer of own ordinary shares in accordance with this item 19.The Board of Directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to authorize the Board of Directors  for the period up until the next annual general meeting  on one or several occasions  to resolve on transfer (sell) of own ordinary shares.

The resolutions under items 20a – 20b below are proposed to be conditional upon each other. Should the majority requirement for item 20b below not be met  the Main Shareholders propose that Calliditas Therapeutics shall be able to enter into an equity swap agreement with a third party in accordance with item 20c below and resolutions under items 20a and 20c shall then be conditional upon each other.Board LTIP 2023 is a program under which the participants will be granted  free of charge  share awards subject to performance vesting (""Share Awards"") that entitle to shares in Calliditas Therapeutics to be calculated in accordance with the principles stipulated below  however not more than 50 000 shares. In order to ensure the delivery of shares under Board LTIP 2023 and Board LTIP 2022 (as defined below)  not more than 90 706 warrants (50 000 warrants for Board LTIP 2023 and 40 706 warrants for Board LTIP 2022) can be issued in accordance with item 20b below.20a – Adoption of a long-term performance-based incentive program for members of the Board of DirectorsThe rationale for the proposalBoard LTIP 2023 is intended for members of the Board of Directors in Calliditas Therapeutics. The Main Shareholders believe that an equity-based incentive program is a central part of an attractive and competitive remuneration package in order to attract  retain and motivate internationally competent members of the Board of Directors  and to incentivise the participants on delivering exceptional performance which contributes to value creation for all shareholders. Board LTIP 2023 is adapted to the current position and needs of Calliditas Therapeutics. The Main Shareholders are of the opinion that Board LTIP 2023 will increase and strengthen the participants' dedication to Calliditas Therapeutics' operations  improve company loyalty and be beneficial to both the shareholders and Calliditas Therapeutics.Conditions for Share AwardsThe following conditions shall apply for the Share Awards.The Share Awards shall be granted free of charge to the participants as soon as practicable after the annual general meeting. The Share Awards shall vest gradually over approximately three years  corresponding to three terms up to the date of  whichever is earliest  (i) the annual general meeting 2026 or (ii) 1 July 2026 (the ""Vesting Date"")  where each term equals the period from one annual general meeting up until the day falling immediately prior to the next annual general meeting or the Vesting Date  as applicable (each such period a ""Term""). The Share Awards shall vest with 1/3 at the end of each Term  provided that the participant is still a Board member of Calliditas Therapeutics on the said date. In addition to the vesting conditions just stated  the Share Awards are subject to performance vesting based on the development of the Calliditas Therapeutics share price  in accordance with the vesting conditions below. The Share Awards are subject to performance vesting based on the development of the Calliditas Therapeutics share price over the period from the date the Share Awards are allocated (""Grant Date"") up to and including the day before the Vesting Date. The development of the share price will be measured based on the volume-weighted average price of the company's share on Nasdaq Stockholm for the 10 trading days immediately preceding the Grant Date and the 10 trading days immediately preceding the Vesting Date  respectively. In the event Calliditas Therapeutics' share price has increased by more than 60 percent  100 percent of the Share Awards shall vest  and should the share price have increased by 20 percent  33 percent of such Share Awards shall vest. In the event of an increase of the share price of between 20 and 60 percent  vesting of the Share Awards will occur linearly. Should the increase of the share price be less than 20 percent  vesting will not occur at all. The earliest point in time at which shares may be obtained from vested Share Awards shall be as soon as possible after the Vesting Date and once an assessment of the performance criteria has been made. Each vested Share Award entitles the holder to receive one share in Calliditas Therapeutics without any compensation being payable provided that the holder is still a Board member of Calliditas Therapeutics at the relevant time of vesting with the exception of certain customary ""good leaver""-situations (death and permanent incapacity to complete the assignment due to illness or accident) and this shall also apply during the first year up until the day of the annual general meeting 2024. The number of Share Awards will be re-calculated in the event that changes occur in Calliditas Therapeutics' equity capital structure  such as a bonus issue  merger  rights issue  share split or reverse share split  reduction of the share capital or similar measures. The Share Awards cannot be transferred and may not be pledged. The Share Awards can be granted by the parent company as well as any other company within the Calliditas Therapeutics group. In the event of a public take-over offer  asset sale  liquidation  merger or any other such transaction affecting Calliditas Therapeutics  the Share Awards will vest in their entirety upon completion of such transaction. The Share Awards shall otherwise be subject to the terms set forth in the separate agreements with the participants and the detailed terms for Board LTIP 2023.AllocationThe number of Share Awards that shall be granted to each participant shall equal the below amount for the respective participant divided by the volume-weighted average price of the Calliditas Therapeutics share on Nasdaq Stockholm for the 10 trading days preceding the Grant Date.The Share Awards under Board LTIP 2023 shall be awarded in accordance with the following:Share Awards calculated based on SEK 1 300 000 to the chairman of the Board of Directors; andShare Awards calculated based on SEK 500 000 to each of Hilde Furberg  Diane Parks  Henrik Stenqvist  Elisabeth Björk and Fred Driscoll.In any event  Board LTIP 2023 will comprise a total number of Share Awards which  if all Share Awards are vested in accordance with the vesting conditions above  can entitle to not more than 50 000 shares in Calliditas Therapeutics.Preparation of the proposalBoard LTIP 2023 has been prepared by the Main Shareholders and has been structured based on an evaluation of prior incentive programs and market practice for comparable European (including Swedish) and American listed companies.DilutionAssuming a volume-weighted average price of the Calliditas Therapeutics share on Nasdaq Stockholm for the 10 trading days preceding the Grant Date of SEK 125  Board LTIP 2023 will comprise not more than 30 400 shares in total  which corresponds to a dilution of approximately 0.1 percent on a fully diluted basis. Taking into account also the shares which may be issued pursuant to previously implemented incentive programs in the company  the maximum dilution amounts to 7.2 percent on a fully diluted basis. Taking into account also the shares which may be issued pursuant to previously implemented incentive programs in the company as well as the incentive program for the company's management and key personnel proposed to the annual general meeting 2023  the maximum dilution amounts to 10.0 percent on a fully diluted basis.Information about Calliditas Therapeutics' existing incentive programs can be found in Calliditas Therapeutics' annual report for 2022  note 10  which is available on the company's website  www.calliditas.se/en/.Scope and costs of the programBoard LTIP 2023 will be accounted for in accordance with ""IFRS 2 – Share-based payments"". IFRS 2 stipulates that the Share Awards shall be expensed as personnel costs over the vesting period and will be accounted for directly against equity. Personnel costs in accordance with IFRS 2 do not affect the company's cash flow. Social security costs will be expensed in the income statement during the vesting period.Assuming a volume-weighted average price of the Calliditas Therapeutics share on Nasdaq Stockholm for the 10 trading days preceding the Grant Date of SEK 125  the annual cost for the Board LTIP 2023  according to IFRS 2  is estimated at approximately SEK 0.7 million before tax. The estimated IFRS 2 cost has been calculated with a Monte Carlo simulation. The annual cost for social security contributions is estimated at SEK 0.4 million  based on an annual increase in the share price of 10 percent  the aforementioned assumptions and a social security tax rate of 31.42 percent. The total annual cost for Board LTIP 2023 during the term of the program  including costs according to IFRS 2 and social security charges  is therefore estimated to approximately SEK 1.1 million.The total cost of the Board LTIP 2023  including all costs referred to above and social security charges  is estimated to amount to approximately SEK 3.3 million under the above assumptions.Delivery of shares under Board LTIP 2023In order to ensure the delivery of shares under Board LTIP 2023  the Main Shareholders propose that the annual general meeting resolves to issue warrants in accordance with item 20b below.20b – Issue of warrantsIn order to ensure the delivery of shares under (i) Board LTIP 2023 and (ii) the long-term performance-based incentive program for members of the Board of Directors adopted by the annual general meeting 2022 (the ""Board LTIP 2022"")  the Main Shareholders propose that the annual general meeting resolves to issue not more than 90 706 warrants (50 000 warrants for Board LTIP 2023 and 40 706 warrants for Board LTIP 2022)  whereby the company's share capital can increase by not more than SEK 3 628 24 in accordance with the following:The right to subscribe for the warrants shall  with deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights  only vest with Nefecon AB  a wholly owned subsidiary of Calliditas Therapeutics. The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights is the implementation of Board LTIP 2023 and to ensure the delivery of shares under Board LTIP 2022. Nefecon AB shall be entitled to transfer the warrants to participants of Board LTIP 2023 and Board LTIP 2022  respectively  or a financial intermediary in connection with the exercise of Share Awards (including the corresponding share awards exercised under Board LTIP 2022). The warrants shall be issued free of charge and shall be subscribed for on a subscription list no later than 1 July 2023. The Board of Directors may extend the subscription period. The detailed terms of the warrants are set out in the complete proposal which is kept available to the shareholders. The exercise price for subscription for shares based on the warrants shall correspond to the share's quota value. The CEO shall be authorized to make such minor adjustments that may be necessary in connection with the registration of the new issue. Notification of subscription of shares by the exercise of Warrants can be made from and including the day of registration of the Warrants with the Swedish Companies Registration Office up until and including 31 December 2026. Shares which are issued following subscription shall entitle to participation in the distribution of profits for the first time on the nearest record date occurring after the subscription has been exercised.20c – Equity swap agreement with a third partyShould the majority requirement for item 20b above not be met  the Main Shareholders propose that the annual general meeting resolves that Board LTIP 2023 shall instead be hedged so that Calliditas Therapeutics can enter into an equity swap agreement with a third party on terms in accordance with market practice  whereby the third party in its own name shall be entitled to acquire and transfer shares of Calliditas Therapeutics to the participants.Item 21 – Resolution  in order to adopt a long-term incentive program for the company's management and key personnel  on:The Board of Directors of Calliditas Therapeutics proposes the introduction of a long-term incentive program for the company's management and key personnel (including employees and consultants) in accordance with the following.The Board of Directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to implement a long-term incentive program for management and key personnel (including employees and consultants) in Calliditas Therapeutics (""ESOP 2023"") in accordance with items 21a – 21b below.The resolutions under items 21a – 21b below are proposed to be conditional upon each other. Should the majority requirement for item 21b below not be met  the Board of Directors proposes that Calliditas Therapeutics shall be able to enter into an equity swap agreement with a third party in accordance with item 21c below and resolutions under items 21a and 21c shall then be conditional upon each other.ESOP 2023 is a program under which the participants will be granted  free of charge  stock options to acquire shares in Calliditas Therapeutics (""Options"")  subject to vesting over a three-year period in accordance with the below. The Board of Directors proposes that a maximum of 2 000 000 Options are allocated to the participants.21a – Adoption of a long-term incentive program for the company's management and key personnelThe rationale for the proposalESOP 2023 is intended for members of management and key personnel (including employees and consultants) in Calliditas Therapeutics. The Board of Directors of Calliditas Therapeutics believes that an equity-based incentive program in the form of stock options is a central part of an attractive and competitive remuneration package in order to attract  retain and motivate competent members of management and key personnel (including employees and consultants) in Calliditas Therapeutics  and to focus the participants on delivering exceptional performance which contributes to value creation for all shareholders.The proposed program is key for the company's ability to attract  retain and motivate competent key persons in the United States as well as in Europe in the company's operations and commercial functions scaling up the market launch of TARPEYO in the United States and the development of the company's pipeline assets. During the fourth quarter of 2021  the company received accelerated approval in the United States and since January 2022  the company commercializes TARPEYO in the United States. When recruiting and maintaining experienced commercial personnel in the United States and other key employees in the United States and Europe  it is important for Calliditas Therapeutics to be able to offer attractive compensation terms. A competitive equity-based incentive program is a key component in order to be able to attract and retain highly skilled and experienced individuals across clinical  manufacturing and regulatory areast  as well as relevant competencies related to Calliditas Therapeutics´ commercialization of TARPEYO in the United States.The Board of Directors of Calliditas Therapeutics believes that ESOP 2023 will fortify the alignment of the interests of the participants and the interests of the shareholders. ESOP 2023 is adapted to the current position and needs of Calliditas Therapeutics. The Board of Directors is of the opinion that ESOP 2023 will increase and strengthen the participants' dedication to Calliditas Therapeutics' operations  improve company loyalty and that ESOP 2023 will be beneficial to both the shareholders and Calliditas Therapeutics.Conditions for OptionsThe following conditions shall apply for the Options.The Options shall be granted free of charge to the participants.The Board of Directors shall resolve upon the allocation of Options between the date of the annual general meeting 2023 and the date of the annual general meeting 2024 (with each respective granting falling on a "" Grant Date "").Each Option entitles the holder to acquire one share in Calliditas Therapeutics for a pre-determined exercise price. The exercise price will correspond to 115 percent of the volume weighted average price of the Calliditas Therapeutics share on Nasdaq Stockholm during the ten trading days preceding the Grant Date.The Options shall vest over a three-year period  with 20 percent on the first anniversary of the Grant Date  with an annual vesting of 40 percent during the second year after the Grant Date  and with an annual vesting of 40 percent during the third year after the Grant Date  and thereafter be exercisable  provided that the holder  with certain exceptions  still is employed by Calliditas Therapeutics (or  in the case of consultants  still provides services to Calliditas Therapeutics).Following the expiry of the vesting period  the Options may be exercised during a one-year period.The number of Options shall be subject to customary re-calculation  for example in the event that changes occur in Calliditas Therapeutics' equity capital structure  such as a bonus issue  merger  rights issue  share split or reverse share split  reduction of the share capital or similar measures.The Options are non-transferable and may not be pledged.The Options may be granted by the parent company as well as any other company within the Calliditas Therapeutics group.In the event of a public take-over offer  asset sale  liquidation  merger or any other such transaction affecting Calliditas Therapeutics  the Options will vest in their entirety following the completion of a change of control.AllocationThe right to receive Options shall accrue to up to 200 employees or consultants of the company. The Board of Directors may grant Options  on one or several occasions  between the date of the annual general meeting 2023 and the date of the annual general meeting 2024. The maximum number of Options that may be allocated to the participants under ESOP 2023 is 2 000 000.The maximum allocation per individual in each category shall be 300 000 Options for Category 1 (CEO)  250 000 Options for Category 2 (Management) and 100 000 Options for Category 3 (Other key personnel and consultants).Preparation  administration and the right to amend the terms of the OptionsThe Board of Directors is responsible for preparing the detailed terms and conditions of ESOP 2023  in accordance with the above-mentioned terms and guidelines. To this end  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to make adjustments to meet foreign regulations or market conditions  including resolving on cash or other settlement if deemed favorable for Calliditas Therapeutics based on foreign tax regulations. The Board of Directors may also make other adjustments if significant changes in Calliditas Therapeutics or its environment would result in a situation where the adopted terms and conditions of ESOP 2023 no longer serve their purpose.Preparation of the proposalESOP 2023 has been initiated by the Board of Directors of Calliditas Therapeutics and has been structured based on an evaluation of prior incentive programs and market practice for comparable European (including Swedish) and American listed companies. ESOP 2023 has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee and reviewed by the Board of Directors.DilutionSubject to certain recalculation conditions  the maximum number of shares that may be issued under ESOP 2023 is 2 000 000 which corresponds to a dilution of approximately 3.3 percent on a fully diluted basis. Taking into account also the shares which may be issued pursuant to already allocated warrants under the company's outstanding incentive programs  the maximum dilution amounts to approximately 10.0 percent on a fully diluted basis.Information about Calliditas Therapeutics' existing incentive programs can be found on Calliditas Therapeutics' website  www.calliditas.se/en/  under ""Remuneration"" as well as in the company's annual report.Scope and costs of the programESOP 2023 will be accounted for in accordance with ""IFRS 2 – Share-based payments"". IFRS 2 stipulates that the Options shall be expensed as personnel costs over the vesting period. Personnel costs in accordance with IFRS 2 do not affect the company's cash flow. Social security costs will be expensed in the income statement according to UFR 7 during the vesting period.Assuming a share price at the time of allocation of Options of SEK 125  an annual increase in the share price of 10 percent and that all Options are allocated up-front under the assumptions set out under ""Dilution"" above  the average annual cost for Calliditas Therapeutics according to IFRS 2 is estimated to approximately SEK 22.0 million per year before tax. The average annual social security costs over the vesting period are estimated to approximately a total of SEK 6.9 million  based on the above assumptions  that all Options are fully vested  a vesting period for all Options of three years and social security costs of 31.42 percent. It is envisaged that the social security costs associated with ESOP 2023 will be covered by the cash received from the participants at exercise of Options. If necessary  social security costs will be covered by hedging measures through the issue of warrants (see item 21b below) which would be exercised by a financial intermediary in connection with the exercise of the Options. In either case  the social security costs associated with ESOP 2023 will be fully covered and will hence not affect the company's cash flow.The total cost of ESOP 2023  including all social security costs  is estimated to amount to approximately SEK 86.7 million under the above assumptions.Delivery of shares under ESOP 2023In order to ensure the delivery of shares under ESOP 2023 and if necessary for hedging of social security costs  the Board of Directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to issue and use warrants in accordance with item 21b below.21b – Issue of warrantsIn order to ensure the delivery of shares under ESOP 2023  and  if necessary  for hedging of social security costs  the Board of Directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to issue not more than 2 000 000 warrants (which includes warrants to potentially hedge social security costs)  whereby the company's share capital could be increased by not more than SEK 80 000.The right to subscribe for the warrants shall  with deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights  only be granted Nefecon AB  a wholly owned subsidiary of Calliditas Therapeutics. The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights is the implementation of ESOP 2023. Nefecon AB shall be entitled to transfer the warrants to participants or a financial intermediary in connection with exercise.The warrants shall be issued free of charge. The exercise price for subscription for shares based on the warrants shall correspond to the share's quota value.The full terms and conditions for the warrants are presented in the complete proposal which is kept available to the shareholders in accordance with the below.21c – Equity swap agreement with a third partyShould the majority requirement for item 21b above not be met  the Board of Directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves that ESOP 2023 instead shall be hedged through an equity swap agreement with a third party on terms in accordance with market practice  whereby the third party in its own name shall be entitled to acquire and transfer shares of Calliditas Therapeutics to the participants.Majority rulesThe implementation of the Board of Directors' proposals under items 17  18 and 19 are subject to the approval at the annual general meeting with at least two thirds (2/3) of both the votes cast and of the shares represented at the meeting.

Business income improved through the quarter to reach a record EUR 414 million  an increase of 2% year-on-year.The Euroclear group's business model provides a hedge against market volatility. When equity markets are lower  the impact is mitigated by the group's diversified and subscription-like business model  and we benefit in a similar vein when bond markets are weaker  as approximately three quarters of the group's business income is decoupled from financial market valuations. Such that  in the recent market environment  when both equity valuations and transaction volumes have been low  any potential impact to us has been mitigated by those operating entities which have a greater relative weighting to the bond markets  which saw business income grow.Over a three-year period  underlying business income has grown 9% CAGR  reflecting the robust growth delivered by the strategy through volatile financial market conditions.Since last year  the interest rate environment has changed dramatically. This has resulted in a large increase in interest earnings due to rising interest rates on cash balances. On an underlying basis  Q1 2023 interest  banking and other income increased by 871% to EUR 237 million because of rising interest rates.Euroclear is investing in its strategy  leading to underlying operating expenses increasing to EUR 307 million  up 19% compared to the prior year.Approximately 10% of the increase in underlying operating expenses is due to inflation on costs  with the remainder reflecting continued investments in its technology and service offering  as well as one-off projects. The investments in Euroclear's technology aim at enhancing Euroclear's client proposition  business resilience  and to increase efficiency through standardisation and modernisation.Euroclear continues to expect expenditure to remain above its 'through-the-cycle' target of 4-6% p.a. throughout 2023  due to accelerating investment in both its strategy and the resilience of the business  coupled with continued inflationary pressures on the cost base. Excluding the impact of inflation and one-off expenditures  Euroclear's Q1 expense profile is broadly in line with the top end of the through-the-cycle range.Nevertheless  profitability has continued to rise  as expected  as inflation headwinds have been more than offset by higher net interest income from subsequent rate increases. The group's underlying EBITDA margin was 57% in the first quarter  a level which is amongst the industry leaders in the financial market infrastructure sector.On an underlying basis  earnings per share almost doubled  up 95% to EUR 81.4 per share.The group maintains a strong capital position and a low-risk profile  which are critical as a financial market infrastructure and create headroom for further growth.Navigating a Challenging Operating Environment while Delivering Euroclear's Growth StrategyFollowing a year in which financial markets experienced negative returns from both equities and fixed income for the first time in over 50 years  activity levels in the first quarter were relatively muted  with low levels of Initial Public Offerings in equity markets and an absence of M&A activity as a driver of capital market operations. Despite this  Euroclear has continued to grow its business income  demonstrating the resilience of its business model and the continued progress in its client-centric strategy.Fixed income markets improved through the quarter  however equities remained volatile which has impacted the group entities and products  such as funds  where there is higher equity exposure. In addition  the higher interest rate environment has reduced demand for some product lines  such as in tri-party securities lending.Euroclear has closely monitored the recent disruption in the banking sector  taking necessary actions to ensure its resilience and support clients where appropriate. The volatility resulted in higher transaction volumes in March at a similar level to last year  following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.In addition  following the market-wide application of sanctions related to Russia  Euroclear continues to comply in its role as financial market infrastructure. See ""Implications of Russian sanctions""  below  for more details.The consequence of the operating environment is shown below in the group's key operating metrics:Q1 2023 Change vs Q1 2022 3-year CAGR Assets under Custody EUR 36.4 trillion -1 % 7.4 % Number of transactions 80 million 0 % 3.3 % Turnover (Value of transactions processed) EUR 275 trillion +1 % 6.6 % Fund assets under custody EUR 2.9 trillion -4 % 11.1 % Collateral Highway EUR 1.7 trillion -12 % 5.7 %At the same time  Euroclear has continued to deliver on its five-year growth strategy and strives towards its ambitious long-term vision to build a digital and data-enabled financial market infrastructure.In line with this vision  Euroclear recently announced a collaboration with Tradeweb and Informa Global Markets to automate the identification and setup process for newly issued Eurobond securities in the primary market. The initiative is expected to reduce cost and risk to the investor community by providing quicker access to reliable deal information.Consistent with its strategy  Euroclear is now exploring further opportunities as it continues the integration of MFEXbyEuroclear to build a compelling proposition for funds services. This includes services in private markets assets  where Euroclear has announced its intention to acquire Goji  a UK-based FinTech (subject to regulatory approvals).A further innovation was delivered in the Negotiable European Commercial Paper Market as Euroclear France opened its services to Italian issuers for the first time. By using the service  Unicredit became the first issuer to access the second largest short-term funding market in Europe.Implications of Russian sanctionsRussia's invasion of Ukraine resulted in market-wide application of international sanctions  which had a material impact on Euroclear's financial market infrastructure. Well established processes are in place which have allowed the group to implement the sanctions while maintaining the normal course of business.There is  however  additional complexity because the package of sanctions is wide-ranging and  moreover  Russia does not recognise the international sanctions and has implemented its own economic countermeasures. Euroclear maintains regular dialogue with clients and other impacted stakeholders in managing the market issues and implications of Russian countermeasures.The international sanctions and Russian countermeasures resulted in a loss of activities from sanctioned clients and Russian securities which impacted business income. However  it has been more than offset by increased interest income.The cash on the balance sheet has increased as blocked coupon payments and redemptions accumulate. At the end of March 2023  Euroclear Bank's balance sheet had increased by EUR 88 billion year-on-year to a total of EUR 140 billion.As per Euroclear's standard process  which is the same for any client's long cash balances  the cash balances arising from the sanctions are invested to minimise credit risk. Over Q1 2023  interest arising on cash balances from Russia-sanctioned assets was EUR 734 million.Future earnings linked to the sanctions will continue to depend on the prevailing interest rate environment and the evolution of the sanctions. The Board expects interest income to continue to grow as blocked payments and redemptions continue to accumulate  albeit at a slower pace during 2023.As previously outlined  while the Russian sanctions materially impact the balance sheet  the impact on the group's capital ratios is not expected to be significant. Euroclear maintains a strong capital position.The nature of the activities undertaken as a financial market infrastructure has led various parties to contest the sanctions and countermeasures  as well as their application  with legal proceedings ongoing in both the European Union and Russia. At present these legal proceedings are not presently considered a material risk and have not incurred any financial impact.Furthermore  Euroclear notes that analysis is being undertaken by the European Commission to consider the potential generation of resources to support Ukraine from reinvestment of immobilised Russian assets.Since considerable uncertainties persist  the Board considers it necessary to separate the sanction-related earnings from the underlying financial results when assessing the company's performance and resources.Euroclear continues to act in a transparent manner with all authorities involved. The Board will continue to act cautiously by not distributing any profits related to the Russian sanctions until the situation becomes clearer.AnnexesEuroclear Bank and Euroclear Investments are the two group issuing entities.

Such share issue resolution may be carried out with or without deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights and with or without provisions for contribution in kind  set-off or other conditions. The authorization may only be utilized to such extent that the number of shares issued by virtue of the authorization  or the number of shares created in connection with exercise of warrants or conversion of convertibles  together with any ordinary shares transferred by virtue of the authorization under item 19 below (provided that the annual general meeting resolves in accordance with the proposal)  in aggregate does not exceed 20 percent of the total number of ordinary shares issued at the time of the general meeting's resolution on the proposed authorization  calculated after full exercise of the hereby proposed authorization.The purpose of the authorization is to increase the financial flexibility of the company and the general flexibility of the Board of Directors.

The resolutions under items 20a – 20b below are proposed to be conditional upon each other. Should the majority requirement for item 20b below not be met  the Main Shareholders propose that Calliditas Therapeutics shall be able to enter into an equity swap agreement with a third party in accordance with item 20c below and resolutions under items 20a and 20c shall then be conditional upon each other.Board LTIP 2023 is a program under which the participants will be granted  free of charge  share awards subject to performance vesting (""Share Awards"") that entitle to shares in Calliditas Therapeutics to be calculated in accordance with the principles stipulated below  however not more than 50 000 shares. In order to ensure the delivery of shares under Board LTIP 2023 and Board LTIP 2022 (as defined below)  not more than 90 706 warrants (50 000 warrants for Board LTIP 2023 and 40 706 warrants for Board LTIP 2022) can be issued in accordance with item 20b below.20a – Adoption of a long-term performance-based incentive program for members of the Board of DirectorsThe rationale for the proposalBoard LTIP 2023 is intended for members of the Board of Directors in Calliditas Therapeutics. The Main Shareholders believe that an equity-based incentive program is a central part of an attractive and competitive remuneration package in order to attract  retain and motivate internationally competent members of the Board of Directors  and to incentivise the participants on delivering exceptional performance which contributes to value creation for all shareholders. Board LTIP 2023 is adapted to the current position and needs of Calliditas Therapeutics. The Main Shareholders are of the opinion that Board LTIP 2023 will increase and strengthen the participants' dedication to Calliditas Therapeutics' operations  improve company loyalty and be beneficial to both the shareholders and Calliditas Therapeutics.Conditions for Share AwardsThe following conditions shall apply for the Share Awards.The Share Awards shall be granted free of charge to the participants as soon as practicable after the annual general meeting. The Share Awards shall vest gradually over approximately three years  corresponding to three terms up to the date of  whichever is earliest  (i) the annual general meeting 2026 or (ii) 1 July 2026 (the ""Vesting Date"")  where each term equals the period from one annual general meeting up until the day falling immediately prior to the next annual general meeting or the Vesting Date  as applicable (each such period a ""Term""). The Share Awards shall vest with 1/3 at the end of each Term  provided that the participant is still a Board member of Calliditas Therapeutics on the said date. In addition to the vesting conditions just stated  the Share Awards are subject to performance vesting based on the development of the Calliditas Therapeutics share price  in accordance with the vesting conditions below. The Share Awards are subject to performance vesting based on the development of the Calliditas Therapeutics share price over the period from the date the Share Awards are allocated (""Grant Date"") up to and including the day before the Vesting Date. The development of the share price will be measured based on the volume-weighted average price of the company's share on Nasdaq Stockholm for the 10 trading days immediately preceding the Grant Date and the 10 trading days immediately preceding the Vesting Date  respectively. In the event Calliditas Therapeutics' share price has increased by more than 60 percent  100 percent of the Share Awards shall vest  and should the share price have increased by 20 percent  33 percent of such Share Awards shall vest. In the event of an increase of the share price of between 20 and 60 percent  vesting of the Share Awards will occur linearly. Should the increase of the share price be less than 20 percent  vesting will not occur at all. The earliest point in time at which shares may be obtained from vested Share Awards shall be as soon as possible after the Vesting Date and once an assessment of the performance criteria has been made. Each vested Share Award entitles the holder to receive one share in Calliditas Therapeutics without any compensation being payable provided that the holder is still a Board member of Calliditas Therapeutics at the relevant time of vesting with the exception of certain customary ""good leaver""-situations (death and permanent incapacity to complete the assignment due to illness or accident) and this shall also apply during the first year up until the day of the annual general meeting 2024. The number of Share Awards will be re-calculated in the event that changes occur in Calliditas Therapeutics' equity capital structure  such as a bonus issue  merger  rights issue  share split or reverse share split  reduction of the share capital or similar measures. The Share Awards cannot be transferred and may not be pledged. The Share Awards can be granted by the parent company as well as any other company within the Calliditas Therapeutics group. In the event of a public take-over offer  asset sale  liquidation  merger or any other such transaction affecting Calliditas Therapeutics  the Share Awards will vest in their entirety upon completion of such transaction. The Share Awards shall otherwise be subject to the terms set forth in the separate agreements with the participants and the detailed terms for Board LTIP 2023.AllocationThe number of Share Awards that shall be granted to each participant shall equal the below amount for the respective participant divided by the volume-weighted average price of the Calliditas Therapeutics share on Nasdaq Stockholm for the 10 trading days preceding the Grant Date.The Share Awards under Board LTIP 2023 shall be awarded in accordance with the following:Share Awards calculated based on SEK 1 300  000 to the chairman of the Board of Directors; and 000 to the chairman of the Board of Directors; and Share Awards calculated based on SEK 500  000 to each of Hilde Furberg   Diane Parks   Henrik Stenqvist  Elisabeth Björk and Fred Driscoll .In any event  Board LTIP 2023 will comprise a total number of Share Awards which  if all Share Awards are vested in accordance with the vesting conditions above  can entitle to not more than 50 000 shares in Calliditas Therapeutics.Preparation of the proposalBoard LTIP 2023 has been prepared by the Main Shareholders and has been structured based on an evaluation of prior incentive programs and market practice for comparable European (including Swedish) and American listed companies.DilutionAssuming a volume-weighted average price of the Calliditas Therapeutics share on Nasdaq Stockholm for the 10 trading days preceding the Grant Date of SEK 125  Board LTIP 2023 will comprise not more than 30 400 shares in total  which corresponds to a dilution of approximately 0.1 percent on a fully diluted basis. Taking into account also the shares which may be issued pursuant to previously implemented incentive programs in the company  the maximum dilution amounts to 7.2 percent on a fully diluted basis. Taking into account also the shares which may be issued pursuant to previously implemented incentive programs in the company as well as the incentive program for the company's management and key personnel proposed to the annual general meeting 2023  the maximum dilution amounts to 10.0 percent on a fully diluted basis.Information about Calliditas Therapeutics' existing incentive programs can be found in Calliditas Therapeutics' annual report for 2022  note 10  which is available on the company's website  www.calliditas.se/en/.Scope and costs of the programBoard LTIP 2023 will be accounted for in accordance with ""IFRS 2 – Share-based payments"". IFRS 2 stipulates that the Share Awards shall be expensed as personnel costs over the vesting period and will be accounted for directly against equity. Personnel costs in accordance with IFRS 2 do not affect the company's cash flow. Social security costs will be expensed in the income statement during the vesting period.Assuming a volume-weighted average price of the Calliditas Therapeutics share on Nasdaq Stockholm for the 10 trading days preceding the Grant Date of SEK 125  the annual cost for the Board LTIP 2023  according to IFRS 2  is estimated at approximately SEK 0.7 million before tax. The estimated IFRS 2 cost has been calculated with a Monte Carlo simulation. The annual cost for social security contributions is estimated at SEK 0.4 million  based on an annual increase in the share price of 10 percent  the aforementioned assumptions and a social security tax rate of 31.42 percent. The total annual cost for Board LTIP 2023 during the term of the program  including costs according to IFRS 2 and social security charges  is therefore estimated to approximately SEK 1.1 million.The total cost of the Board LTIP 2023  including all costs referred to above and social security charges  is estimated to amount to approximately SEK 3.3 million under the above assumptions.Delivery of shares under Board LTIP 2023In order to ensure the delivery of shares under Board LTIP 2023  the Main Shareholders propose that the annual general meeting resolves to issue warrants in accordance with item 20b below.20b – Issue of warrantsIn order to ensure the delivery of shares under (i) Board LTIP 2023 and (ii) the long-term performance-based incentive program for members of the Board of Directors adopted by the annual general meeting 2022 (the ""Board LTIP 2022"")  the Main Shareholders propose that the annual general meeting resolves to issue not more than 90 706 warrants (50 000 warrants for Board LTIP 2023 and 40 706 warrants for Board LTIP 2022)  whereby the company's share capital can increase by not more than SEK 3 628 24 in accordance with the following:The right to subscribe for the warrants shall  with deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights  only vest with Nefecon AB  a wholly owned subsidiary of Calliditas Therapeutics. The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights is the implementation of Board LTIP 2023 and to ensure the delivery of shares under Board LTIP 2022. Nefecon AB shall be entitled to transfer the warrants to participants of Board LTIP 2023 and Board LTIP 2022  respectively  or a financial intermediary in connection with the exercise of Share Awards (including the corresponding share awards exercised under Board LTIP 2022). The warrants shall be issued free of charge and shall be subscribed for on a subscription list no later than 1 July 2023 . The Board of Directors may extend the subscription period. The detailed terms of the warrants are set out in the complete proposal which is kept available to the shareholders. The exercise price for subscription for shares based on the warrants shall correspond to the share's quota value. The CEO shall be authorized to make such minor adjustments that may be necessary in connection with the registration of the new issue. Notification of subscription of shares by the exercise of Warrants can be made from and including the day of registration of the Warrants with the Swedish Companies Registration Office up until and including 31 December 2026 . Shares which are issued following subscription shall entitle to participation in the distribution of profits for the first time on the nearest record date occurring after the subscription has been exercised.20c – Equity swap agreement with a third partyShould the majority requirement for item 20b above not be met  the Main Shareholders propose that the annual general meeting resolves that Board LTIP 2023 shall instead be hedged so that Calliditas Therapeutics can enter into an equity swap agreement with a third party on terms in accordance with market practice  whereby the third party in its own name shall be entitled to acquire and transfer shares of Calliditas Therapeutics to the participants.Item 21 – Resolution  in order to adopt a long-term incentive program for the company's management and key personnel  on:The Board of Directors of Calliditas Therapeutics proposes the introduction of a long-term incentive program for the company's management and key personnel (including employees and consultants) in accordance with the following.The Board of Directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to implement a long-term incentive program for management and key personnel (including employees and consultants) in Calliditas Therapeutics (""ESOP 2023"") in accordance with items 21a – 21b below.The resolutions under items 21a – 21b below are proposed to be conditional upon each other. Should the majority requirement for item 21b below not be met  the Board of Directors proposes that Calliditas Therapeutics shall be able to enter into an equity swap agreement with a third party in accordance with item 21c below and resolutions under items 21a and 21c shall then be conditional upon each other.ESOP 2023 is a program under which the participants will be granted  free of charge  stock options to acquire shares in Calliditas Therapeutics (""Options"")  subject to vesting over a three-year period in accordance with the below. The Board of Directors proposes that a maximum of 2 000 000 Options are allocated to the participants.21a – Adoption of a long-term incentive program for the company's management and key personnelThe rationale for the proposalESOP 2023 is intended for members of management and key personnel (including employees and consultants) in Calliditas Therapeutics. The Board of Directors of Calliditas Therapeutics believes that an equity-based incentive program in the form of stock options is a central part of an attractive and competitive remuneration package in order to attract  retain and motivate competent members of management and key personnel (including employees and consultants) in Calliditas Therapeutics  and to focus the participants on delivering exceptional performance which contributes to value creation for all shareholders.The proposed program is key for the company's ability to attract  retain and motivate competent key persons in the United States as well as in Europe in the company's operations and commercial functions scaling up the market launch of TARPEYO in the United States and the development of the company's pipeline assets. During the fourth quarter of 2021  the company received accelerated approval in the United States and since January 2022  the company commercializes TARPEYO in the United States. When recruiting and maintaining experienced commercial personnel in the United States and other key employees in the United States and Europe  it is important for Calliditas Therapeutics to be able to offer attractive compensation terms. A competitive equity-based incentive program is a key component in order to be able to attract and retain highly skilled and experienced individuals across clinical  manufacturing and regulatory areast  as well as relevant competencies related to Calliditas Therapeutics´ commercialization of TARPEYO in the United States.The Board of Directors of Calliditas Therapeutics believes that ESOP 2023 will fortify the alignment of the interests of the participants and the interests of the shareholders. ESOP 2023 is adapted to the current position and needs of Calliditas Therapeutics. The Board of Directors is of the opinion that ESOP 2023 will increase and strengthen the participants' dedication to Calliditas Therapeutics' operations  improve company loyalty and that ESOP 2023 will be beneficial to both the shareholders and Calliditas Therapeutics.Conditions for OptionsThe following conditions shall apply for the Options.The Options shall be granted free of charge to the participants.The Board of Directors shall resolve upon the allocation of Options between the date of the annual general meeting 2023 and the date of the annual general meeting 2024 (with each respective granting falling on a "" Grant Date "").""). Each Option entitles the holder to acquire one share in Calliditas Therapeutics for a pre-determined exercise price. The exercise price will correspond to 115 percent of the volume weighted average price of the Calliditas Therapeutics share on Nasdaq Stockholm during the ten trading days preceding the Grant Date.The Options shall vest over a three-year period  with 20 percent on the first anniversary of the Grant Date  with an annual vesting of 40 percent during the second year after the Grant Date  and with an annual vesting of 40 percent during the third year after the Grant Date  and thereafter be exercisable  provided that the holder  with certain exceptions  still is employed by Calliditas Therapeutics (or  in the case of consultants  still provides services to Calliditas Therapeutics).Following the expiry of the vesting period  the Options may be exercised during a one-year period.The number of Options shall be subject to customary re-calculation  for example in the event that changes occur in Calliditas Therapeutics' equity capital structure  such as a bonus issue  merger  rights issue  share split or reverse share split  reduction of the share capital or similar measures.The Options are non-transferable and may not be pledged.The Options may be granted by the parent company as well as any other company within the Calliditas Therapeutics group.In the event of a public take-over offer  asset sale  liquidation  merger or any other such transaction affecting Calliditas Therapeutics  the Options will vest in their entirety following the completion of a change of control.AllocationThe right to receive Options shall accrue to up to 200 employees or consultants of the company. The Board of Directors may grant Options  on one or several occasions  between the date of the annual general meeting 2023 and the date of the annual general meeting 2024. The maximum number of Options that may be allocated to the participants under ESOP 2023 is 2 000 000.The maximum allocation per individual in each category shall be 300 000 Options for Category 1 (CEO)  250 000 Options for Category 2 (Management) and 100 000 Options for Category 3 (Other key personnel and consultants).Preparation  administration and the right to amend the terms of the OptionsThe Board of Directors is responsible for preparing the detailed terms and conditions of ESOP 2023  in accordance with the above-mentioned terms and guidelines. To this end  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to make adjustments to meet foreign regulations or market conditions  including resolving on cash or other settlement if deemed favorable for Calliditas Therapeutics based on foreign tax regulations. The Board of Directors may also make other adjustments if significant changes in Calliditas Therapeutics or its environment would result in a situation where the adopted terms and conditions of ESOP 2023 no longer serve their purpose.Preparation of the proposalESOP 2023 has been initiated by the Board of Directors of Calliditas Therapeutics and has been structured based on an evaluation of prior incentive programs and market practice for comparable European (including Swedish) and American listed companies. ESOP 2023 has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee and reviewed by the Board of Directors.DilutionSubject to certain recalculation conditions  the maximum number of shares that may be issued under ESOP 2023 is 2 000 000 which corresponds to a dilution of approximately 3.3 percent on a fully diluted basis. Taking into account also the shares which may be issued pursuant to already allocated warrants under the company's outstanding incentive programs  the maximum dilution amounts to approximately 10.0 percent on a fully diluted basis.Information about Calliditas Therapeutics' existing incentive programs can be found on Calliditas Therapeutics' website  www.calliditas.se/en/  under ""Remuneration"" as well as in the company's annual report.Scope and costs of the programESOP 2023 will be accounted for in accordance with ""IFRS 2 – Share-based payments"". IFRS 2 stipulates that the Options shall be expensed as personnel costs over the vesting period. Personnel costs in accordance with IFRS 2 do not affect the company's cash flow. Social security costs will be expensed in the income statement according to UFR 7 during the vesting period.Assuming a share price at the time of allocation of Options of SEK 125  an annual increase in the share price of 10 percent and that all Options are allocated up-front under the assumptions set out under ""Dilution"" above  the average annual cost for Calliditas Therapeutics according to IFRS 2 is estimated to approximately SEK 22.0 million per year before tax. The average annual social security costs over the vesting period are estimated to approximately a total of SEK 6.9 million  based on the above assumptions  that all Options are fully vested  a vesting period for all Options of three years and social security costs of 31.42 percent. It is envisaged that the social security costs associated with ESOP 2023 will be covered by the cash received from the participants at exercise of Options. If necessary  social security costs will be covered by hedging measures through the issue of warrants (see item 21b below) which would be exercised by a financial intermediary in connection with the exercise of the Options. In either case  the social security costs associated with ESOP 2023 will be fully covered and will hence not affect the company's cash flow.The total cost of ESOP 2023  including all social security costs  is estimated to amount to approximately SEK 86.7 million under the above assumptions.Delivery of shares under ESOP 2023In order to ensure the delivery of shares under ESOP 2023 and if necessary for hedging of social security costs  the Board of Directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to issue and use warrants in accordance with item 21b below.21b – Issue of warrantsIn order to ensure the delivery of shares under ESOP 2023  and  if necessary  for hedging of social security costs  the Board of Directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to issue not more than 2 000 000 warrants (which includes warrants to potentially hedge social security costs)  whereby the company's share capital could be increased by not more than SEK 80 000.The right to subscribe for the warrants shall  with deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights  only be granted Nefecon AB  a wholly owned subsidiary of Calliditas Therapeutics. The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights is the implementation of ESOP 2023. Nefecon AB shall be entitled to transfer the warrants to participants or a financial intermediary in connection with exercise.The warrants shall be issued free of charge. The exercise price for subscription for shares based on the warrants shall correspond to the share's quota value.The full terms and conditions for the warrants are presented in the complete proposal which is kept available to the shareholders in accordance with the below.21c – Equity swap agreement with a third partyShould the majority requirement for item 21b above not be met  the Board of Directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves that ESOP 2023 instead shall be hedged through an equity swap agreement with a third party on terms in accordance with market practice  whereby the third party in its own name shall be entitled to acquire and transfer shares of Calliditas Therapeutics to the participants.Majority rulesThe implementation of the Board of Directors' proposals under items 17  18 and 19 are subject to the approval at the annual general meeting with at least two thirds (2/3) of both the votes cast and of the shares represented at the meeting.

Full details and instructions on these electronic proxy facilities are given on the respective websites.CREST proxy instructionsCREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so for the meeting (and any adjournment of the meeting) by following the procedures described in the CREST Manual (available via www.euroclear.com). CREST Personal Members or other CREST sponsored members (and those CREST members who have appointed a voting service provider) should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider  who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf. In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made by means of CREST to be valid  the appropriate CREST message (a' CREST Proxy Instruction ') must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear's specifications and must contain the information required for such instructions  as described in the CREST Manual. The message (regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or an amendment to the instruction given to a previously appointed proxy) must  in order to be valid  be transmitted so as to be received by the issuer's agent (ID RA19) by the latest time(s) for receipt of proxy appointments specified in note 3 above. For this purpose  the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Applications Host) from which the issuer's agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. After this time any change of instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should be communicated to the appointee through other means. CREST members (and  where applicable  their CREST sponsors or voting service providers) should note that Euroclear does not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or  if the CREST member is a CREST personal member or sponsored member or has appointed a voting service provider  to procure that their CREST sponsor or voting service provider takes) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection  CREST members (and  where applicable  their CREST sponsors or voting service providers) are referred  in particular  to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings. The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001.Proxymity11. If you are an institutional investor you may be able to appoint a proxy electronically via the Proxymity platform  a process which has been agreed by the Company and approved by the Registrar. For further information regarding Proxymity  please go to www. proxymity.io. Your proxy must be lodged by 2.00 pm on Friday 9 June 2023 in order to be considered valid. Before you can appoint a proxy via this process you will need to have agreed to Proxymity's associated terms and conditions. It is important that you read these carefully as you will be bound by them and they will govern the electronic appointment of your proxy.",neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,negative,0.0,0.38,0.61,True,English,"['2023 Annual General Meeting', 'Pod Point', 'Proxy Form', ""Equiniti Registrars' online portfolio service"", 'CREST electronic proxy appoint', 'CREST Proxy Voting Service', ""My Investments' page"", 'FREEPOST RTHJ- CLLL-KBKU', 'usual user ID', 'West Sussex BN99', 'electronic proxy appointments', 'electronic proxy facilities', 'Annual General Meeting', 'CREST proxy instructions', 'Shareholder Reference Number', 'Proxymity service', 'Online voting', 'Equiniti Limited', 'Voting ID', 'ordinary shareholder', 'FREEPOST RTHJ-CLLL-KBKU', 'CREST members', 'voting rights', 'Task ID', 'online proxies', 'virtual facility', 'joint holders', 'Aspect House', 'Spencer Road', 'country code', 'bank holidays', 'same envelope', 'working days', 'Companies Act', 'other cases', 'Record date', 'website address', 'Full details', 'respective websites', 'one holder', 'onscreen instructions', 'Friday 9 June', 'corporate representatives', 'other authority', 'same way', 'co.uk', 'Nominated persons', 'virtual meeting', 'additional Forms', 'one proxy', 'Ordinary Shares', 'same shares', 'UK time', 'proxy form', 'vote', 'senior', 'order', 'names', 'register', 'Chair', 'part', 'someone', 'words', 'space', 'Shareholders', 'shareholding', 'Company', 'Lancing', 'Lines', 'BST', 'document', 'copy', 'All', 'power', 'attorney', 'certified', 'accordance', 'notes', 'AGM', 'adjournment', '2pm', 'behalf', 'communications', 'section', 'agreement', 'exercise', 'corporation', 'two', 'Entitlement', 'close', 'business', 'changes', 'terms', 'conditions', 'Shareview', 'password', 'link', '5:30', '48', '6:30']",2023-04-28,2023-04-29,marketscreener.com

The complete content of the main proposals is presented below. Election of chairman of the meeting (item 1) It is proposed that Dennis Lundquist from Qap Legal Advisors be appointed chairman of the meeting or  in the event of him being prevented  a person appointed by the board of directors. Allocation of result (item 7b) The Board of Directors proposes to allocate the Company's results in the approved balance sheet  in accordance with the Board of Director's proposal in the Annual Report where the result is to be carried forward. Establishment of fees to the Board of Directors and the auditors (item 8) Shareholders representing approximately 29.83 percent of the shares and 38.65 percent of the votes propose that an annual fee of one price base amount (in 2023 corresponding to SEK 52 500 excl. social charges) shall be paid to each ordinary board member and the chairman of the board who is not employed by  and receives salary from  the Company. To the extent that a board member performs work on behalf of the Company  in addition to its work as a board member  such board member shall be entitled to consulting fees and other compensation. Any compensation for such work must be invoiced with a total amount corresponding to the gross fee plus social charges. For the work that the chairman of the board performs  in addition to the work within the framework of the board  a fee of 7.5 price base amounts shall be paid. Furthermore  it is proposed that the fees to the auditors shall be paid by approved account according to normal standards. Election of Board of Directors and auditor or auditing firm (item 9) Shareholders representing approximately 29.83 percent of the shares and 38.65 percent of the votes proposes that  for the period up until the next Annual General Meeting  to (i) re-elect Christopher Brinkeborn Beselin  Mikael Steinbach and Philip Lindqvist as ordinary board members  (ii) re-elect Christopher Brinkeborn Beselin as chairman of the board and (iii) re-elect Annika Beselin as deputy board member. Furthermore  it is proposed to re-elect BDO Mälardalen AB as the Company's auditing firm with Patrik Nygard as the auditor in charge. Resolution approving the transfer of a total of 15 percent of the shares in the subsidiary Fram Skata AB (Carmudi) to key employees (item 10) In accordance with Chapter 16 of the Swedish Companies Act (the so-called""Leo-Act"") must  in certain cases  transfer of shares in subsidiaries to  for example  employees in the company group be approved by the general meeting of the parent company. In light of the above  the Board of Directors proposes that the general meeting resolves to approve the transfer of a total of 15 percent of the shares in the Company's subsidiary Fram Skata AB (Carmudi)  reg.no 559154-8077 (the ""Subsidiary"") to Keshav Rustagi  who is employed in the company group. The purpose of the transfers is both to increase the Subsidiary's management team's incentive to build a valuable business for the Company's shareholders in the long term and at the same time make the Subsidiary a more attractive investment target for new external investors. Professional and institutional investors in venture capital normally expect the management team of early-stage companies to own at least 50 percent of the shares and generally prefer that the management team owns as large a share as possible of the companies they invest in (in order for the management teams to have the incentive to build the companies all the way to large fast-growing market leaders). In line with what has previously been communicated  the Company therefore seeks to generally increase the ownership of the subsidiaries' management teams significantly over time. The objective is  of course  that this also on a 1(6) net basis will mean greater value creation for the group's shareholders - i.e. the current value of the shares allocated to the management team is expected to be compensated multiple times by the increase in value of the Subsidiary driven by external investors' increased appetite to invest in them. The problem of under-ownership of the subsidiaries' management teams has recurred very regularly in the numerous external investor conversations the group has had over the past years. The Board of Directors proposes that the general meeting approves the transfer of 150 shares  corresponding to 15 percent of the shares and votes in the Subsidiary to Keshav Rustagi  for an amount of SEK 50 per share. In connection with the transfer of shares to Keshav Rustagi  the Company shall by written agreement have the right to repurchase the shares if Keshav Rustagi's employment in the group is terminated or if Keshav Rustagi wishes to transfer the shares. The shares are subject to so-called vesting. 25 percent of the shares are vested after one year and the remaining shares are vested quarterly over a period of an additional 3 years. Decision in accordance with this proposal require support by shareholders holding not less than nine tenths of both the shares voted and of the shares represented at the general meeting. Resolution approving the transfer of a total of 15 percent of the shares in the subsidiary Fram Venture 9 AB (EveHR) to key employee (item 11) In accordance with Chapter 16 of the Swedish Companies Act (the so-called""Leo-Act"") must  in certain cases  transfer of shares in subsidiaries to  for example  employees in the company group be approved by the general meeting of the parent company. In light of the above  the Board of Directors proposes that the general meeting resolves to approve the transfer of a total of 15 percent of the shares in the Company's subsidiary Fram Venture 9 AB (EveHR)  reg.no 559165-8470 (the ""Subsidiary"") to Bach Tuan Anh  who is employed in the company group. The purpose of the transfers is both to increase the Subsidiary's management team's incentive to build a valuable business for the Company's shareholders in the long term and at the same time make the Subsidiary a more attractive investment target for new external investors. Professional and institutional investors in venture capital normally expect the management team of early-stage companies to own at least 50 percent of the shares and generally prefer that the management team owns as large a share as possible of the companies they invest in (in order for the management teams to have the incentive to build the companies all the way to large fast-growing market leaders).

The problem of under-ownership of the subsidiaries' management teams has recurred very regularly in the numerous external investor conversations the group has had over the last years. The Board of Directors proposes that the general meeting approves the transfer of 167 shares  corresponding to 15 percent of the shares and votes in the Subsidiary to Bach Tuan Anh  for an amount of SEK 50 per share. In connection with the transfer of shares to Bach Tuan Anh  the Company shall by written agreement have the right to repurchase the shares if Bach Tuan Anh's employment in the group is terminated or if Bach Tuan Anh wishes to transfer the shares. The shares are subject to so-called vesting. 25 percent of the shares are vested after one year and the remaining shares are vested quarterly over a period of 3 additional years. Decision in accordance with this proposal require support by shareholders holding not less than nine tenths of both the shares voted and of the shares represented at the general meeting. Resolution regarding authorizing the Board of Directors to resolve to issue shares  convertibles and/or warrants (item 12) The Board of Directors proposes that the general meeting resolves to authorize the Board of Directors at one or several occasions  and with or without deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  resolve on an increase of the Company's share capital through a new issue of shares of series A and/or 2(6) series B  convertibles and/or warrants  which entails the issue of or conversion to a number of shares corresponding to a maximum dilution of 25 percent of the share capital in the Company. Payment shall be made in cash  in kind  by set-off or otherwise in accordance with terms. The purpose of the authorization and the reason for any deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights is that new issues shall be able to take place to meet the Company's capital needs and secure the Company's continued operations and development. In the event of a deviation from the shareholders' preferential right  the new issue shall be made on market terms. The authorization shall be valid until the next annual general meeting of the Company. The board of directors  or a person appointed by the board of directors shall be authorized to make any adjustments required to register the resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and Euroclear Sweden AB. Decision in accordance with this proposal require support by shareholders holding not less than two- thirds of both the shares voted and of the shares represented at the general meeting. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * 3(6) FULLSTÄNDIGA FÖRSLAG TILL BESLUT VID ÅRSSTÄMMA I FRAM SKANDINAVIEN AB (PUBL) DEN 12 MAJ 2023 Aktieägarna i Fram Skandinavien AB (publ)  org.nr 556760-2692 (""Bolaget"")  har den 11 april 2023 kallats till ordinarie bolagsstämma (årsstämma) i Bolaget fredagen den 12 maj 2023 klockan 10.00 i Qap Legal Advisors lokaler på Norrlandsgatan 7 i Stockholm. De huvudsakliga förslagens fullständiga innehåll framgår enligt nedan. Val av ordförande vid stämman (punkt 1) Föreslås att Dennis Lundquist från Qap Legal Advisors utses till ordförande vid stämman eller  vid förhinder för denne  den som styrelsen anvisar. Resultatdisposition (punkt 7b) Styrelsen föreslår årsstämman att disponera över Bolagets resultat enligt styrelsens förslag i årsredovisningen enligt vilket Bolagets resultat överförs i ny räkning. Fastställande av styrelse- och revisorsarvoden (punkt 8) Aktieägare representerande cirka 29 83 procent av aktierna och 38 65 procent av rösterna föreslår att ett årligt arvode ska utgå om ett prisbasbelopp (2023 motsvarar det 52 500 kronor exkl. sociala avgifter) till varje ordinarie styrelseledamot och styrelsens ordförande som inte är anställd i  och uppbär lön från  Bolaget. I den mån styrelseledamot utför arbete för Bolagets räkning  vid sidan av styrelsearbetet  ska konsultarvode och annan ersättning för sådant arbete kunna faktureras med ett totalbelopp som motsvarar bruttoarvode plus sociala avgifter. För det arbete som styrelsens ordförande utför  utöver arbetet inom ramen för styrelsen  ska ett arvode om 7 5 prisbasbelopp utgå. Föreslås vidare att revisorsarvoden ska utgå på godkänd räkning enligt sedvanliga debiteringsnormer. Val av styrelse och revisor eller revisionsbolag (punkt 9) Aktieägare representerande cirka 29 83 procent av aktierna och 38 65 procent av rösterna föreslår att  för tiden intill nästkommande årsstämma (i) omvälja Christopher Brinkeborn Beselin  Mikael Steinbach och Philip Lindqvist till ordinarie ledamöter  (ii) omvälja Christopher Brinkeborn Beselin till styrelsens ordförande och (iii) omvälja Annika Beselin till suppleant i Bolaget. Föreslås vidare att  för tiden intill nästa årsstämma omvälja BDO Mälardalen AB till Bolagets revisionsbolag och Patrik Nygard till huvudansvarig revisor. Beslut om godkännande av överlåtelse av sammanlagt 15 procent av aktierna I dotterbolaget Fram Skata AB (Carmudi) till nyckelpersoner (punkt 10) Enligt 16 kap. aktiebolagslagen (den s.k. ""Leo-lagen"") ska i vissa fall överlåtelse av aktier i dotterbolag till bland annat anställda i koncernen godkännas av bolagsstämman i moderbolaget. Mot bakgrund av detta föreslår styrelsen att stämman fattar beslut om att godkänna överlåtelse av sammanlagt 15 procent av aktierna i Bolagets dotterbolag Fram Skata AB (Carmudi)  org.nr 559154-8077 (""Dotterbolaget"")  till Keshav Rustagi som är anställd i koncernen. Syftet med överlåtelsen är både att öka Dotterbolagets ledningsgrupps incitament att långsiktigt bygga en värdefull verksamhet för Bolagets aktieägare och samtidigt göra Dotterbolaget till ett mer attraktivt investeringsobjekt för nya externa investerare. Professionella och institutionella investerare inom venture capital förväntar sig normalt att ledningsgruppen i tidiga bolag äger minst 50 procent av aktierna och föredrar generellt att ledningsgruppen äger så stor andel som möjligt av bolagen de investerar i (för att dessa ledningsgrupper ska ha incitament att bygga bolagen hela vägen till snabbväxande marknadsledare). I linje med vad som tidigare kommunicerats  söker Bolaget därför att generellt öka på dotterbolagens ledningsgruppers ägande betydligt över tid. Målsättningen är naturligtvis att detta även på nettobasis ska innebära ett större värdeskapande för koncernens aktieägare - dvs. dagens värde på de andelar som tilldelas ledningsgruppen förväntas mångdubbelt kompenseras av värdeökningen i Dotterbolaget som drivs av externa investerares ökade aptit att investera i dem. Problemet med att 4(6) dotterbolagens ledningsgrupper äger för liten andel har återkommit mycket regelbundet i de otaliga externa investerarkonversationer som koncernen haft under de senaste åren.. Styrelsen föreslår att stämman godkänner överlåtelse av 150 aktier  motsvarande 15 procent av aktierna och rösterna i Dotterbolaget  till Keshav Rustagi  för ett belopp om 50 kr per aktie. I samband med överlåtelserna av aktier till Keshav Rustagi ska Bolaget genom avtal förbehålla sig rätten att återköpa aktier om Keshav Rustagis anställning i koncernen upphör eller om Keshav Rustagi önskar vidareöverlåta aktierna. Aktierna är föremål för s.k. vesting. 25 procent av aktierna är intjänade efter ett år och därefter tjänas resterande aktier in kvartalsvis över en period om ytterligare 3 år. Beslutet förutsätter biträde av aktieägare med minst nio tiondelar såväl av de avgivna rösterna som de aktier som är företrädda vid stämman. Beslut om godkännande av överlåtelse av sammanlagt 15 procent av aktierna I dotterbolaget Fram Venture 9 AB (EveHR) till nyckelpersoner (punkt 11) Enligt 16 kap. aktiebolagslagen (den s.k. ""Leo-lagen"") ska i vissa fall överlåtelse av aktier i dotterbolag till bland annat anställda i koncernen godkännas av bolagsstämman i moderbolaget. Mot bakgrund av detta föreslår styrelsen att stämman fattar beslut om att godkänna överlåtelse av sammanlagt 15 procent av aktierna i Bolagets dotterbolag Fram Venture 9 AB (EveHR)  org.nr 559165-8470 (""Dotterbolaget"")  till Bach Tuan Anh  som är anställd i koncernen.

Aktierna är föremål för s.k. vesting. 25 procent av aktierna är intjänade efter ett år och därefter tjänas resterande aktier in kvartalsvis över en period om ytterligare 3 år. Beslutet förutsätter biträde av aktieägare med minst nio tiondelar såväl av de avgivna rösterna som de aktier som är företrädda vid stämman. Beslut om bemyndigande för styrelsen att fatta beslut om emission av aktier  konvertibler och/eller teckningsoptioner (punkt 12) Styrelsen föreslår att bolagsstämman beslutar om bemyndigande för Bolagets styrelse att  vid ett eller flera tillfällen och med eller utan avvikelse från aktieägarnas företrädesrätt  besluta om ökning av Bolagets aktiekapital genom nyemission av aktier av serie A och/eller serie B  konvertibler och/eller teckningsoptioner som innebär utgivande av eller konvertering till ett. Antal aktier motsvarande en maximal utspädning om 25 procent av aktiekapitalet i Bolaget. Betalning ska kunna ske kontant  genom apport  genom kvittning eller i övrigt med villkor. Syftet med bemyndigandet och skälen till eventuell avvikelse från aktieägarnas företrädesrätt är att emissioner ska kunna ske för att tillgodose Bolagets kapitalbehov och säkra Bolagets fortsatta verksamhet och utveckling. Vid avvikelse från aktieägarnas företrädesrätt ska emission ske på marknadsmässiga villkor. Bemyndigandet ska gälla för tiden intill nästa årsstämma i Bolaget. Styrelsen eller den styrelsen utser bemyndigas att vidta de smärre justeringar som krävs för beslutets registrering vid Bolagsverket och Euroclear Sweden AB. 5(6) Attachments Original LinkOriginal DocumentPermalink Disclaimer Fram Skandinavien AB (publ) published this content on 27 April 2023 and is solely responsible for the information contained therein.

In addition  a new section is proposed  § 11  which authorizes the Board of Directors to resolve that persons not being shareholders shall be allowed to attend general meetings.Following the insertion of a new section  a renumbering of sections is proposed  whereby the previous § 11 becomes § 12 and so on.Current wording Proposed wording 4 § Share capital and number of sharesThe share capital shall be not less than SEK 710 000 and not morethan SEK 2 840 000.

Such share issue resolution may be carried out with or without deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights and with or without provisions for contribution in kind  set-off or other conditions. The authorization may only be utilized to such extent that the number of shares issued by virtue of the authorization  or the number of shares created in connection with exercise of warrants or conversion of convertibles  together with any ordinary shares transferred by virtue of the authorization under item 19 below (provided that the annual general meeting resolves in accordance with the proposal)  in aggregate does not exceed 20 percent of the total number of ordinary shares issued at the time of the general meeting's resolution on the proposed authorization  calculated after full exercise of the hereby proposed authorization.The purpose of the authorization is to increase the financial flexibility of the company and the general flexibility of the Board of Directors.

In order to facilitate for the implementation of the ATM program  the annual general meeting 2022 adopted resolutions whereby  among other things  a new class of shares (C-shares) was introduced in the articles of association and the Board of Directors was authorized to resolve on the issue  repurchase and transfer of 5 908 019 C-shares after conversion to ordinary shares. On 20 June 2022  the board of directors resolved by virtue of the authorizations to issue and repurchase 5 908 019 C-shares as well as to convert the C-shares to ordinary shares  which the company has held in treasury since. The company does not intend to carry forward with the ATM program  meaning that the program will be terminated without any of the 5 908 019 ordinary shares being exercized  and as a complement to the proposal to authorize the Board of Directors to resolve on issue of new shares  warrants and/or convertibles in accordance with item 18 above  the Board of Directors therefore proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to authorize the Board of Directors to resolve on transfer of own ordinary shares in accordance with this item 19.The Board of Directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to authorize the Board of Directors  for the period up until the next annual general meeting  on one or several occasions  to resolve on transfer (sell) of own ordinary shares.

Upon such transfers  the price shall be established so that it is not below market price. Transfers of own ordinary shares pursuant to this item may be made by a maximum of 5 908 018 ordinary shares held by the company at the time of this notice (or the lower number of own ordinary shares held by the company at any given time)  provided that the total number of shares transferred  together with shares issued or shares that may be created in connection with the exercise of warrants or conversion of convertibles issued by virtue of the authorization under item 18 above (provided that the annual general meeting resolves in accordance with the proposal)  in aggregate does not exceed 20 percent of the total number of ordinary shares issued at the time of the general meeting's resolution on the proposed authorization  calculated after full exercise of the proposed authorization under item 18.The purpose of the authorization is to finance an acquisition of operations  to procure capital to finance the development of projects  repayment of loans or to commercialize the company' s products.Item 20 – Resolution  in order to adopt a long-term performance-based incentive program for members of the Board of Directors  on:Linc AB and Stiftelsen Industrifonden which  as of the date of this notice  together represents 17 percent of the outstanding shares and votes in Calliditas Therapeutics  (the ""Main Shareholders"") proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to implement a long-term performance-based incentive program for members of the Board of Directors of Calliditas Therapeutics AB (""Board LTIP 2023"") in accordance with items 20a – 20b below. The resolutions under items 20a – 20b below are proposed to be conditional upon each other. Should the majority requirement for item 20b below not be met  the Main Shareholders propose that Calliditas Therapeutics shall be able to enter into an equity swap agreement with a third party in accordance with item 20c below and resolutions under items 20a and 20c shall then be conditional upon each other.Board LTIP 2023 is a program under which the participants will be granted  free of charge  share awards subject to performance vesting (""Share Awards"") that entitle to shares in Calliditas Therapeutics to be calculated in accordance with the principles stipulated below  however not more than 50 000 shares. In order to ensure the delivery of shares under Board LTIP 2023 and Board LTIP 2022 (as defined below)  not more than 90 706 warrants (50 000 warrants for Board LTIP 2023 and 40 706 warrants for Board LTIP 2022) can be issued in accordance with item 20b below.20a – Adoption of a long-term performance-based incentive program for members of the Board of DirectorsThe rationale for the proposalBoard LTIP 2023 is intended for members of the Board of Directors in Calliditas Therapeutics. The Main Shareholders believe that an equity-based incentive program is a central part of an attractive and competitive remuneration package in order to attract  retain and motivate internationally competent members of the Board of Directors  and to incentivise the participants on delivering exceptional performance which contributes to value creation for all shareholders. Board LTIP 2023 is adapted to the current position and needs of Calliditas Therapeutics. The Main Shareholders are of the opinion that Board LTIP 2023 will increase and strengthen the participants' dedication to Calliditas Therapeutics' operations  improve company loyalty and be beneficial to both the shareholders and Calliditas Therapeutics.Conditions for Share AwardsThe following conditions shall apply for the Share Awards.The Share Awards shall be granted free of charge to the participants as soon as practicable after the annual general meeting.

The Share Awards shall vest with 1/3 at the end of each Term  provided that the participant is still a Board member of Calliditas Therapeutics on the said date. In addition to the vesting conditions just stated  the Share Awards are subject to performance vesting based on the development of the Calliditas Therapeutics share price  in accordance with the vesting conditions below. The Share Awards are subject to performance vesting based on the development of the Calliditas Therapeutics share price over the period from the date the Share Awards are allocated (""Grant Date"") up to and including the day before the Vesting Date. The development of the share price will be measured based on the volume-weighted average price of the company's share on Nasdaq Stockholm for the 10 trading days immediately preceding the Grant Date and the 10 trading days immediately preceding the Vesting Date  respectively. In the event Calliditas Therapeutics' share price has increased by more than 60 percent  100 percent of the Share Awards shall vest  and should the share price have increased by 20 percent  33 percent of such Share Awards shall vest. In the event of an increase of the share price of between 20 and 60 percent  vesting of the Share Awards will occur linearly. Should the increase of the share price be less than 20 percent  vesting will not occur at all. The earliest point in time at which shares may be obtained from vested Share Awards shall be as soon as possible after the Vesting Date and once an assessment of the performance criteria has been made. Each vested Share Award entitles the holder to receive one share in Calliditas Therapeutics without any compensation being payable provided that the holder is still a Board member of Calliditas Therapeutics at the relevant time of vesting with the exception of certain customary ""good leaver""-situations (death and permanent incapacity to complete the assignment due to illness or accident) and this shall also apply during the first year up until the day of the annual general meeting 2024. The number of Share Awards will be re-calculated in the event that changes occur in Calliditas Therapeutics' equity capital structure  such as a bonus issue  merger  rights issue  share split or reverse share split  reduction of the share capital or similar measures. The Share Awards cannot be transferred and may not be pledged. The Share Awards can be granted by the parent company as well as any other company within the Calliditas Therapeutics group. In the event of a public take-over offer  asset sale  liquidation  merger or any other such transaction affecting Calliditas Therapeutics  the Share Awards will vest in their entirety upon completion of such transaction. The Share Awards shall otherwise be subject to the terms set forth in the separate agreements with the participants and the detailed terms for Board LTIP 2023.AllocationThe number of Share Awards that shall be granted to each participant shall equal the below amount for the respective participant divided by the volume-weighted average price of the Calliditas Therapeutics share on Nasdaq Stockholm for the 10 trading days preceding the Grant Date.The Share Awards under Board LTIP 2023 shall be awarded in accordance with the following:Share Awards calculated based on SEK 1 300  000 to the chairman of the Board of Directors; and 000 to the chairman of the Board of Directors; and Share Awards calculated based on SEK 500  000 to each of Hilde Furberg   Diane Parks   Henrik Stenqvist  Elisabeth Björk and Fred Driscoll .In any event  Board LTIP 2023 will comprise a total number of Share Awards which  if all Share Awards are vested in accordance with the vesting conditions above  can entitle to not more than 50 000 shares in Calliditas Therapeutics.Preparation of the proposalBoard LTIP 2023 has been prepared by the Main Shareholders and has been structured based on an evaluation of prior incentive programs and market practice for comparable European (including Swedish) and American listed companies.DilutionAssuming a volume-weighted average price of the Calliditas Therapeutics share on Nasdaq Stockholm for the 10 trading days preceding the Grant Date of SEK 125  Board LTIP 2023 will comprise not more than 30 400 shares in total  which corresponds to a dilution of approximately 0.1 percent on a fully diluted basis. Taking into account also the shares which may be issued pursuant to previously implemented incentive programs in the company  the maximum dilution amounts to 7.2 percent on a fully diluted basis. Taking into account also the shares which may be issued pursuant to previously implemented incentive programs in the company as well as the incentive program for the company's management and key personnel proposed to the annual general meeting 2023  the maximum dilution amounts to 10.0 percent on a fully diluted basis.Information about Calliditas Therapeutics' existing incentive programs can be found in Calliditas Therapeutics' annual report for 2022  note 10  which is available on the company's website  www.calliditas.se/en/.Scope and costs of the programBoard LTIP 2023 will be accounted for in accordance with ""IFRS 2 – Share-based payments"". IFRS 2 stipulates that the Share Awards shall be expensed as personnel costs over the vesting period and will be accounted for directly against equity. Personnel costs in accordance with IFRS 2 do not affect the company's cash flow. Social security costs will be expensed in the income statement during the vesting period.Assuming a volume-weighted average price of the Calliditas Therapeutics share on Nasdaq Stockholm for the 10 trading days preceding the Grant Date of SEK 125  the annual cost for the Board LTIP 2023  according to IFRS 2  is estimated at approximately SEK 0.7 million before tax. The estimated IFRS 2 cost has been calculated with a Monte Carlo simulation. The annual cost for social security contributions is estimated at SEK 0.4 million  based on an annual increase in the share price of 10 percent  the aforementioned assumptions and a social security tax rate of 31.42 percent. The total annual cost for Board LTIP 2023 during the term of the program  including costs according to IFRS 2 and social security charges  is therefore estimated to approximately SEK 1.1 million.The total cost of the Board LTIP 2023  including all costs referred to above and social security charges  is estimated to amount to approximately SEK 3.3 million under the above assumptions.Delivery of shares under Board LTIP 2023In order to ensure the delivery of shares under Board LTIP 2023  the Main Shareholders propose that the annual general meeting resolves to issue warrants in accordance with item 20b below.20b – Issue of warrantsIn order to ensure the delivery of shares under (i) Board LTIP 2023 and (ii) the long-term performance-based incentive program for members of the Board of Directors adopted by the annual general meeting 2022 (the ""Board LTIP 2022"")  the Main Shareholders propose that the annual general meeting resolves to issue not more than 90 706 warrants (50 000 warrants for Board LTIP 2023 and 40 706 warrants for Board LTIP 2022)  whereby the company's share capital can increase by not more than SEK 3 628 24 in accordance with the following:The right to subscribe for the warrants shall  with deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights  only vest with Nefecon AB  a wholly owned subsidiary of Calliditas Therapeutics. The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights is the implementation of Board LTIP 2023 and to ensure the delivery of shares under Board LTIP 2022. Nefecon AB shall be entitled to transfer the warrants to participants of Board LTIP 2023 and Board LTIP 2022  respectively  or a financial intermediary in connection with the exercise of Share Awards (including the corresponding share awards exercised under Board LTIP 2022). The warrants shall be issued free of charge and shall be subscribed for on a subscription list no later than 1 July 2023 . The Board of Directors may extend the subscription period. The detailed terms of the warrants are set out in the complete proposal which is kept available to the shareholders.

Notification of subscription of shares by the exercise of Warrants can be made from and including the day of registration of the Warrants with the Swedish Companies Registration Office up until and including 31 December 2026 . Shares which are issued following subscription shall entitle to participation in the distribution of profits for the first time on the nearest record date occurring after the subscription has been exercised.20c – Equity swap agreement with a third partyShould the majority requirement for item 20b above not be met  the Main Shareholders propose that the annual general meeting resolves that Board LTIP 2023 shall instead be hedged so that Calliditas Therapeutics can enter into an equity swap agreement with a third party on terms in accordance with market practice  whereby the third party in its own name shall be entitled to acquire and transfer shares of Calliditas Therapeutics to the participants.Item 21 – Resolution  in order to adopt a long-term incentive program for the company's management and key personnel  on:The Board of Directors of Calliditas Therapeutics proposes the introduction of a long-term incentive program for the company's management and key personnel (including employees and consultants) in accordance with the following.The Board of Directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to implement a long-term incentive program for management and key personnel (including employees and consultants) in Calliditas Therapeutics (""ESOP 2023"") in accordance with items 21a – 21b below.The resolutions under items 21a – 21b below are proposed to be conditional upon each other.

During the fourth quarter of 2021  the company received accelerated approval in the United States and since January 2022  the company commercializes TARPEYO in the United States. When recruiting and maintaining experienced commercial personnel in the United States and other key employees in the United States and Europe  it is important for Calliditas Therapeutics to be able to offer attractive compensation terms.

Taking into account also the shares which may be issued pursuant to already allocated warrants under the company's outstanding incentive programs  the maximum dilution amounts to approximately 10.0 percent on a fully diluted basis.Information about Calliditas Therapeutics' existing incentive programs can be found on Calliditas Therapeutics' website  www.calliditas.se/en/  under ""Remuneration"" as well as in the company's annual report.Scope and costs of the programESOP 2023 will be accounted for in accordance with ""IFRS 2 – Share-based payments"". IFRS 2 stipulates that the Options shall be expensed as personnel costs over the vesting period. Personnel costs in accordance with IFRS 2 do not affect the company's cash flow. Social security costs will be expensed in the income statement according to UFR 7 during the vesting period.Assuming a share price at the time of allocation of Options of SEK 125  an annual increase in the share price of 10 percent and that all Options are allocated up-front under the assumptions set out under ""Dilution"" above  the average annual cost for Calliditas Therapeutics according to IFRS 2 is estimated to approximately SEK 22.0 million per year before tax. The average annual social security costs over the vesting period are estimated to approximately a total of SEK 6.9 million  based on the above assumptions  that all Options are fully vested  a vesting period for all Options of three years and social security costs of 31.42 percent. It is envisaged that the social security costs associated with ESOP 2023 will be covered by the cash received from the participants at exercise of Options. If necessary  social security costs will be covered by hedging measures through the issue of warrants (see item 21b below) which would be exercised by a financial intermediary in connection with the exercise of the Options. In either case  the social security costs associated with ESOP 2023 will be fully covered and will hence not affect the company's cash flow.The total cost of ESOP 2023  including all social security costs  is estimated to amount to approximately SEK 86.7 million under the above assumptions.Delivery of shares under ESOP 2023In order to ensure the delivery of shares under ESOP 2023 and if necessary for hedging of social security costs  the Board of Directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to issue and use warrants in accordance with item 21b below.21b – Issue of warrantsIn order to ensure the delivery of shares under ESOP 2023  and  if necessary  for hedging of social security costs  the Board of Directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to issue not more than 2 000 000 warrants (which includes warrants to potentially hedge social security costs)  whereby the company's share capital could be increased by not more than SEK 80 000.The right to subscribe for the warrants shall  with deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights  only be granted Nefecon AB  a wholly owned subsidiary of Calliditas Therapeutics. The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights is the implementation of ESOP 2023. Nefecon AB shall be entitled to transfer the warrants to participants or a financial intermediary in connection with exercise.The warrants shall be issued free of charge. The exercise price for subscription for shares based on the warrants shall correspond to the share's quota value.The full terms and conditions for the warrants are presented in the complete proposal which is kept available to the shareholders in accordance with the below.21c – Equity swap agreement with a third partyShould the majority requirement for item 21b above not be met  the Board of Directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves that ESOP 2023 instead shall be hedged through an equity swap agreement with a third party on terms in accordance with market practice  whereby the third party in its own name shall be entitled to acquire and transfer shares of Calliditas Therapeutics to the participants.Majority rulesThe implementation of the Board of Directors' proposals under items 17  18 and 19 are subject to the approval at the annual general meeting with at least two thirds (2/3) of both the votes cast and of the shares represented at the meeting. Resolution in accordance with items 20b and 21b above requires approval of at least nine tenths (9/10) of the shares represented and votes cast at the annual general meeting.Shareholder's right to obtain informationShareholders are reminded of their right to  at the annual general meeting  obtain information from the Board of Directors and CEO in accordance with Chapter 7 Section 32 of the Swedish Companies Act.

The company has identified global factors  such as cost inflation  global economic decline and the war in Ukraine. Robit expects construction industry demand to remain good in the company’s key market area of North America. In Europe  demand is expected to remain at the current level  slightly below the level in 2022. The demand is supported by the substantial construction industry funding that has already been decided. The general deterioration of the economic outlook and high-cost inflation may cause construction projects to be postponed. GUIDANCE FOR 2023 Robit expects net sales in 2023 to increase and comparable EBITDA profitability in euros to remain unchanged or improve slightly from 2022  assuming that there are no significant changes in the exchange rates from the level at the end of 2022. CEO ARTO HALONEN: Robit’s first quarter was challenging and slow to start  as anticipated in Q4 reporting. Net sales were EUR 21.9 million  down 16.6 percent on the corresponding period. In constant currencies  there was a decrease of 15.7 percent. Orders received totalled EUR 23.0 million  down by 18.0 percent from the comparison period. The company did not manage to compensate lost sales from Russia. The company grew in the Australasia and EMEA regions. In Australasia  the company’s growth was supported by several large-scale product tests that were under way during the quarter  especially in the Top Hammer business segment. In the EMEA region  growth came from the Nordic countries  in particular. Sales in the East region decreased by 90.3 percent due to the discontinuation of business operations in Russia and Belarus  which accounted for EUR 2.4 million of Q1/2022 sales. In the Americas region  sales decreased by 24.4 percent. The decrease in net sales came especially from North America  where the sales were affected by the high stock levels of some distributors and the sales delays caused by late customer receivables. Sales in the Asia region decreased by 23.0 percent due to the low utilisation rate of quarry customers in certain countries important to the company and the low demand in the Korean tunnel market in the early part of the year. Net sales in the Top Hammer business decreased by 22.8 percent. Sales developed positively in Australia. In other markets  Top Hammer sales declined due to low sales in the Asia and EMEA regions. Net sales also decreased in the Down the Hole and Geotechnical businesses. The decrease in net sales from the Down the Hole business came from the Americas region  in particular. In the Geotechnical business  sales increased in all main markets except the Americas. The company is in the process of strengthening its distribution channel and sales resources in the Geotechnical segment in North America. In addition  the company signed three new distributor agreements in the early part of the year  further strengthening its distributor network. The company’s focus is on investing in sales activity and winning active sales opportunities. The market demand  which has remained good overall  will support sales growth towards the end of the year. In the first quarter  EBITDA was EUR 0.1 million (0.9). Profitability was particularly burdened by the weakening of the Geotechnical business and the low utilisation rate of Down the Hole manufacturing. The manufacturing costs of Geotechnical products continued to rise  especially due to high raw material costs  and this could not be fully compensated for in the pricing of projects. In the Top Hammer business  profitability in euros was weakened by the decrease in net sales. Exchange differences caused by changes in foreign exchange rates also weakened the company’s EBITDA during the quarter. The company has initiated measures to correct the weak result in the first part of the year. In order to strengthen profitability  the company has started a cost-savings programme. The company aims to achieve savings of approximately EUR 5 million from the level of 2022  of which EUR 2–3 million are expected to materialize during this year. The cost-savings programme is divided into three areas: procurement savings  fixed costs and strategic assessment of the manufacturing network. The company is accelerating the implementation of savings in procurement and cutting the company’s fixed costs. In addition  the company is launching a study to optimise the structure of its manufacturing and procurement network. In order to strengthen cash flow  the company will continue the implementation of the Fit for Service programme  which focuses on the development of working capital management. NET SALES Net sales by product area Robit reports its net sales for three operating units in 2023: Top Hammer  Down the Hole and Geotechnical. Previously  the company reported the Geotechnical unit as part of the Down the Hole unit.

The net sales of the Halco brand decreased and the net sales of Robit products increased accordingly during the period.

The Annual General Meeting resolved that the profit for the financial year 1 January–31 December 2022 would be transferred to the profit and loss account and no dividend would be paid based on the adopted balance sheet for the financial year 1 January–31 December 2022. The Annual General Meeting resolved to distribute to the shareholders EUR 0.02 of the company’s distributable funds per outstanding share. The distribution of funds will be executed as return of capital from the company’s invested unrestricted equity fund. The return of capital will be paid to shareholders who  on the record date of the return of capital on 22 September 2023  are in the shareholder’s register held by Euroclear Finland. The return of capital will be paid on 29 September 2023. The Annual General Meeting resolved to discharge the members of the Board of Directors and the Managing Directors from liability for the financial year ended 31 December 2022. The Annual General Meeting decided to approve the Remuneration Report for Governing Bodies. According to the Limited Liability Companies Act  the decision is advisory. The Annual General Meeting resolved that the Board of Directors consists of six (6) members. Mikko Kuitunen  Anne Leskelä  Harri Sjöholm  Markku Teräsvasara and Eeva-Liisa Virkkunen were re-elected as members of the Board of Directors. Lasse Aho was elected as a new member of the Board. The annual remuneration for the Chair of the Board is EUR 55 000 and the annual remuneration for the other Board members is EUR 30 000. Forty per cent of the remuneration is paid in shares  and the remaining 60% is an advance tax withheld and paid to the Finnish Tax Administration by the company. The Board members is paid a meeting fee of EUR 500 per meeting attended for Board meetings and committee meetings. If the meeting is held remotely and lasts no more than 1 hour  EUR 250 is paid as a one-time meeting fee. Other costs  such as travel and lodging expenses  are also compensated. The annual remuneration of the Chair of the Board and Board members for the entire term of office will be paid in December 2023. The part of the remuneration paid in shares may be paid by issuing new shares in the company or by acquiring shares by the authorisation given to the Board of Directors by the Annual General Meeting. The receiver of the remuneration pays the transfer tax. PricewaterhouseCoopers Oy (PwC) was elected as the company’s auditor for a term that will continue until the end of the next Annual General Meeting. PwC has notified the company that Authorised Public Accountant Markku Katajisto will serve as the company’s principal responsible auditor. The Annual General Meeting resolved to pay the auditor’s remuneration in accordance with a reasonable invoice approved by the company. The Annual General Meeting resolved to authorise the Board of Directors to resolve on the acquisition of a maximum of 2 117 990 treasury shares and/or accepting the same number of treasury shares as a pledge  in one or several tranches by using funds in the unrestricted shareholders’ equity. The maximum total of shares that will be acquired and/or accepted as a pledge corresponds to 10% of all the shares in the company as of the date of the notice to the General Meeting. However  the company cannot  together with its subsidiary companies  own or accept as a pledge altogether more than 10% of its own shares at any point in time. The company’s shares may be purchased under this authorisation solely by using unrestricted shareholders’ equity. The shares will be acquired other than in proportion to the share ownership of the shareholders via public trading arranged by Nasdaq Helsinki Ltd at the market price on the date on which the acquisition is made or at a price formed on the market. It is proposed that the authorisation be used for the purposes of implementing the company’s share-based incentive schemes or for other purposes as decided by the Board of Directors  for example. It was resolved that the authorisation revokes the authorisation granted by the Annual General Meeting on 22 March 2022 to decide on the acquisition of treasury shares. The authorisation is valid until the closing of the next Annual General Meeting  but no longer than until 30 June 2024. The Annual General Meeting resolved to authorise the Board of Directors to resolve on a share issue and on the issuance of special rights entitling to shares as referred to in chapter 10  section 1 of the Finnish Limited Liability Companies Act  in one or more tranches  either against or without consideration. The number of shares to be issued  including shares to be issued on the basis of special rights  may not exceed 2 117 990  which amounts to 10% of all shares in the company as at the date of the notice to the Annual General Meeting. The Board of Directors may decide to either issue new shares or to transfer any treasury shares held by the company. The authorisation entitles the Board of Directors to decide on all terms that apply to the share issue and to the issuance of special rights entitling to shares  including the right to derogate from the shareholders’ pre-emptive right. The authorisation will be used  for example  for the purposes of strengthening the company’s balance sheet and improving its financial status or for other purposes as decided by the Board of Directors. The authorisation is valid until the closing of the next Annual General Meeting  but no longer than until 30 June 2024. The authorisation will revoke all the previously granted  unused authorisations to decide on a share issue and the issuance of options or other special rights entitling to shares. The Annual General Meeting resolved to add to section 8 of the Articles of Association the possibility for the Board of Directors to decide on the organisation of the Annual General Meeting as a hybrid meeting at its discretion. In addition  the amendment enables the organisation of a general meeting as a remote meeting without a meeting venue. According to the resolution of the Annual General Meeting  section 8 of the Articles of Association  after the amendment  reads as follows: “Section 8 The notice of the general meeting is published on the company’s website no earlier than two months and no later than 21 days before the meeting  but always no later than nine (9) days before the record date of the general meeting referred to in the Limited Liability Companies Act.

Trading volume in January–March was 4 670 247 shares (916 927). The company holds 52 308 treasury shares (0.2 percent of total shares). On 31 March 2023  the market value of the company’s shares was EUR 46.8 million. The closing price of the share was EUR 2.21. The highest price in the review period was EUR 3.48 and the lowest price EUR 2.15. RISKS AND BUSINESS UNCERTAINTIES The geopolitical situation  which is growing tenser  poses a risk to the company’s business. The war in Ukraine and the sanctions imposed on Russia affect the development of net sales and profitability especially in Russia  Belarus and Ukraine  which accounted for approximately 8 percent of the company’s sales in the 2022 financial year. The crisis has caused  and may continue to cause  significant increases in raw material prices. As regards Russia  Robit complies with all the imposed sanctions and continuously monitors the situation. The covenant of the Robit parent company’s financing agreement  net interest-bearing debt/EBITDA  did not meet the terms of the financing agreement on 31 March 2023. The company obtained the consent of its main financier to the breach of the covenant on 22 March 2023. This leads to a higher financial cost and risk for the company. Other uncertainty factors include exchange rate development  the functioning of information systems  integration of corporate acquisitions  risks related to the security of supply and logistics  IPR risks and potential impacts of COVID-19. Fully transferring the increase in raw material costs to customer prices may pose a financial risk. Changes in export countries’ tax and customs legislation may adversely impact the company’s export trade or its profitability. Risks related to information security and cyber threats may also have a detrimental effect on Robit’s business. Potential changes in the business environment may adversely impact the payment behaviour of the Group’s customers and increase the risk of litigation  legal claims and disputes related to Robit’s products and other operations. CHANGES IN GROUP STRUCTURE There were no changes in the Group structure during the review period. OTHER EVENTS DURING THE REVIEW PERIOD On 11 January 2023  Robit Plc announced that its VP  Global Sales and Management Team member George Apostolopoulos would be leaving his duties for new challenges outside the company. Apostolopoulos will continue in his position until the summer of 2023. The process of recruiting Apostolopoulos’ successor is under way. The sales of global sales areas has also been the responsibility of CEO Arto Halonen  and he will continue in his duties  bearing the responsibility of half of the area’s sales. On 18 January 2023  the company announced the proposals of Robit Plc’s Shareholders’ Nomination Committee regarding the Board members and Board fees for the Annual General Meeting. The Nomination Committee’s proposals were included in the notice to the Annual General Meeting. Timo Sallinen (Senior Vice-President  Investments  Varma Mutual Pension Insurance Company) chaired the Shareholders’ Nomination Committee  with Harri Sjöholm (Chair of the Board of Five Alliance Oy)  Jukka Vähäpesola (Head of Equities of Elo Mutual Pension Insurance Company) and Markus Lindqvist (Sustainability Director of Aktia Pankki Oyj) as the other members. On 20 February 2023  Robit Plc published its financial statements release for 1 January–31 December 2022. On 20 February 2023  the company sent Robit Plc’s shareholders a notice to the Annual General Meeting of 15 March 2023. On 20 February 2023  Robit Plc’s Board of Directors decided on a performance-based share reward scheme for key personnel. The purpose of the share scheme is to align the owners’ and the key persons’ goals in order to increase the value of the company in the long term  to commit the key persons to the company and to encourage them to achieve the company’s key strategic goals as well as to provide them with a competitive long-term incentive scheme. The share scheme includes earning periods of one and two years. The first earning period of the share scheme comprises the year 2023. The reward for the earning period 2023 is divided into a guaranteed part and a performance-based part. The guaranteed part is 50% of the base share allocation defined for the participant. The performance-based part of the share allocation is determined by a bonus coefficient based on the company’s predetermined net cash flow from operating activities in the financial statements for 2023. The second earning period covers the years 2024–2025. The potential reward that may be paid under the share scheme for the two-year earning period is based on the company’s predetermined average earnings per share in the financial statements for 2024 and 2025. The share scheme’s potential reward for both earning periods will be paid in May 2026. The share scheme covers the CEO and approximately 20 key persons  members of the Management Team and high-potential employees. A participant in the share plan must have a valid employment or service contract in the company. The Management Team members included in the share scheme are subject to the ownership obligation  meaning that the Management Team member must own 50% of the net shares paid to them on the basis of the entire plan until their shareholding in the company corresponds to 50% of their annual salary. The Board of Directors decides on the earning potential of each key person in the target group. The total amount of share rewards payable on the basis of the earning periods 2023 and 2024–2025 corresponds to a maximum of 240 000 Robit Plc shares  which represents 1.1% of the company’s current share capital. The share reward  if earned  is a gross reward from which tax is withheld  and the net reward is paid to key personnel in shares. The purpose of the cash contribution is to cover the taxes and parafiscal charges arising from the reward. The company decides on the relative proportion of shares and money  for example on a country-by-country  individual or personnel group basis. The share scheme is dimensioned in such a way that the relative proportion of the share transfer taking place under all share schemes in force at the company will remain below 4% of the company’s shares. On 22 February 2023  Robit Plc announced that the company’s Annual Report  Corporate Governance Statement and Remuneration Report for 2022 had been published on the company’s website.

The unit’s activities focus on project business  which is of a different nature to the primary business of the Down the Hole and Top Hammer units. Down the Hole focuses on DTH drilling consumables used in mines  quarries and well drilling. Top Hammer focuses on top hammer drilling consumables used in mines  quarries  construction projects and tunnelling. All figures in the summarised financial statement have been rounded to the nearest figure; therefore  the sum of reported figures may not exactly match those presented. 2.1 KEY FIGURES Key figures Q1 2023 Q1 2022 2022 Net sales  EUR thousand 21 933 26 302 111 962 EBIT  EUR thousand -1 389 -492 3 071 EBIT  per cent of sales -6 3 % -1 9 % 2 7 % Earnings per share (EPS)  EUR -0 08 -0 04 0 04 Return on equity (ROE) % -14 3 % -6 8 % 1 6 % Return on capital employed (ROCE) % -6 5 % -2 1 % 3 5 % Equity ratio % 46 6 % 44 1 % 46 5 % Gearing ratio % 63 1 % 66 3 % 56 4 % Gross investments  EUR thousand 239 420 1 326 Gross investments  % of net sales 1 1 % 1 6 % 1 2 % Number of shares (outstanding) 21 127 592 21 091 436 21 127 592 Treasury shares (owned by the Group) 52 308 88 464 52 308 Percentage of total shares 0 2 % 0 42 % 0 24 % 2.2 CALCULATION OF KEY FIGURES EBITDA: EBIT + Depreciation  amortisation and impairment EBITA EBIT + Amortisation of customer relationships Net working capital Inventory + Accounts receivables and other receivables – Accounts payables and other liabilities Earnings per share (EPS)  EUR Profit (loss) for the financial year Amount of shares adjusted with the share issue (average during the financial year) Return on equity (ROE)  % Profit (loss) for the financial year x 100 Equity (average during the financial year) Return on capital employed (ROCE)  % Profit before appropriations and taxes + Interest expenses and other financing expenses x 100 Equity (average during the financial year) + Interest-bearing financial liabilities (long-term and short-term loans from financial institutions  average during the financial year) Net interest-bearing financial liabilities Long-term and short-term loans from financial institutions – Cash and cash equivalents – Short-term financial securities Equity ratio  % Equity x 100 Balance sheet total – Advances received Gearing  % Net interest-bearing financial liabilities x 100 Equity 3.

ACQUISITIONS There were no changes in the Group structure during the review period. 8. DERIVATIVES The company hedges the most significant net currency positions that can be predicted in time and volume and interest rate risk. There were no open currency derivatives at the end of the review period. On 8 June 2021  the company concluded a financing agreement of EUR 30 million and  in connection with this  an interest rate swap of EUR 10 million with an interest rate cap in order to hedge part of its exposure to fluctuating interest rates. The interest rate swap will take effect on 30 June 2023 and it will end on 30 June 2026. The company applies hedge accounting in accordance with IFRS 9. This effectively leads to the recording of interest expenses on a hedged floating rate loan at a fixed rate.

This will accelerate the approval process and potentially the launch of ZERVIATE in China.ZERVIATE is the first and only eye drop formulation of the antihistamine cetirizine  the active ingredient in ZYRTEC®  and is currently commercialized in the U.S. for ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis. The prescription market for allergic conjunctivitis products in China is expected to grow to almost $500 million by 2030. Ocumension is forecasting potential annual net sales of ZERVIATE >$100 million within 7 years.The ZERVIATE NDA in China is supported by the data package licensed by Nicox to Ocumension and an additional Chinese Phase 3 clinical trial of ZERVIATE run by Ocumension. ZERVIATE was compared to emedastine difumarate ophthalmic solution  0.05%  an antihistamine marketed under the brand name EMADINE®. ZERVIATE was found to be non-inferior to emedastine difumarate in the primary efficacy endpoint of change from baseline in the itching score in the 24 hours prior to the Day 14 visit. ZERVIATE was safe and well-tolerated with no difference in the proportion of patients with adverse events compared to emedastine difumarate.The priority review and approval process of NMPA is designed to expedite the approval of drugs that address unmet medical needs or have the potential to offer significant improvements over existing treatment options. The inclusion of ZERVIATE in the priority review and approval process of NMPA will accelerate the review and approval process of its new drug application  which is an important step towards commercialization of ZERVIATE.ZERVIATE is exclusively licensed to Ocumension Therapeutics for development and commercialization in the Chinese and the majority of the Southeast Asian markets. All costs of commercialization are borne by Ocumension and Nicox may potentially receive sales milestones of up to US$17.2 million together with royalties of between 5% and 9% of net sales of ZERVIATE by Ocumension.Ocumension’s Press Release can be found here.,neutral,0.0,0.99,0.0,mixed,0.49,0.25,0.26,True,English,"['ZERVIATE New Drug Application', 'Partner Ocumension Therapeutics', 'Priority Review Status', 'Nicox', 'China', 'N ew D rug A pplication', 'additional Chinese Phase 3 clinical trial', 'National Medical Products Administration', 'potential annual net sales', 'unmet medical needs', 'international ophthalmology company', 'New Drug Application', 'exclusive Chinese partner', 'eye drop formulation', 'primary efficacy endpoint', 'existing treatment options', 'Southeast Asian markets', 'cetirizine ophthalmic solution', 'allergic conjunctivitis products', 'difumarate ophthalmic solution', 'Priority Review Status', 'The ZERVIATE NDA', 'sales milestones', 'emedastine difumarate', 'p artner', 'Sophia Antipolis', 'Euronext Paris', 'antihistamine cetirizine', 'active ingredient', 'U.S.', 'ocular itching', 'prescription market', 'data package', 'brand name', 'itching score', 'Day 14 visit', 'adverse events', 'significant improvements', 'important step', 'approval process', 'Press Release', 'Ocumension Therapeutics', 'Nicox SA', 'ZERVIATE® approval', 'April', 'China', 'launch', 'France', 'People', 'Republic', 'NMPA', 'first', 'ZYRTEC®', '7 years', 'EMADINE', 'change', 'baseline', '24 hours', 'difference', 'proportion', 'patients', 'drugs', 'inclusion', 'commercialization', 'development', 'majority', 'costs', 'royalties', '7:30']",2023-04-28,2023-04-29,finance.yahoo.com

The non-IFRS financial measures presented are measures used by management to monitor the underlying performance of the business and operations and  have therefore not been audited or reviewed.

This suspension is beyond McPhy's control and is not linked to the execution of the contract by McPhy.The completion of the project to date has already provided an important learning curve for the scaling up of McPhy's tool and industrial experience. The Company is ready to take over the execution of the project as soon as its client  Siemens Energy  expresses its intention.As a reminder  the CEOG project includes the production of hydrogen thanks to a high power electrolyzer  Augmented McLyzer 16 MW  supplied by McPhy  linked to a solar photovoltaic park  coupled with a hydrogen storage unit and high-power fuel cells to reduce the carbon footprint related to the supply of electricity to 10 000 households in French Guiana.Pending further information from Siemens Energy on the follow-up of this project  McPhy has to assume at this stage a negative impact on its first half revenue of €2 million. In this context  McPhy estimates that its revenue for the first half of the year will be between €6 and €8 million. McPhy specifies that it has recorded approximately 60% of the CEOG project revenue as of December 31  2022  which is not affected by the suspension.Upcoming financial events:Annual General Meeting: May 24  20232023 Half-Year Results: 27 July 2023  after market closeStory continuesABOUT MCPHYSpecialized in hydrogen production and distribution equipment  McPhy is contributing to the global deployment of low-carbon hydrogen as a solution for energy transition.

Faced with difficulties predicting the development of our market  we recorded accounting impairments which affected our earnings. Nevertheless  our cash management was improved through the cost reduction measures rolled out  effective from the second half of 2022. This was accomplished while maintaining an international commercial strategy and continuing to improve our software solutions. For instance  we further enhanced our XpertEye solution with a number of additional features  while making it simpler to use thanks to the On & Live concept. We also improved our commercial offering through initiatives aimed at facilitating the widespread adoption of different uses of our solutions. These key steps forward enabled us to successfully renew virtually all of the projects started in 2020 with our most significant clients and to further expand our client base. In view of these developments  combined with the continued improvement in the quality and price of the hardware associated with our solutions  orders are expected to pick up again in 2023”.Story continues2022 earningsAMA recorded revenues of €4.3m in 2022  compared with €6.6m in 2021  down 34.8% at current exchange rates. This trend continues to reflect the wait-and-see approach adopted by clients faced with an unfavorable economic environment.The percentage of revenues generated by Software  AMA’s core business with its XpertEye platform  increased by +5% (at current exchange rates) compared with 2021  climbing to 63% of revenues for the year (versus 37% in 2021)  for a total of €2.6m. However  the percentage of Hardware revenues contracted by 63% to represent 27% of 2022 revenues  compared with 46% the previous year  for a total of €1.1m. Hardware comprises a range of equipment (connected glasses  external video sources  etc.) supplied by third parties that complement the use of XpertEye.In 2022  AMA further strengthened its client base  with 497 clients  up from 490 in 2021. AMA consolidated its positions with its existing clients  primarily major groups (e.g. Merck  Alstom  Air Liquide  Boehringer  KPMG)  by renewing the vast majority of the significant contracts signed in 2020  but with lower average basket values  linked in particular to the non-renewal of Hardware. The churn rate remained limited to 7.9% of 2021 revenues and corresponded primarily to clients representing €4.2k of revenues on average over the year. In 2022  AMA welcomed 119 new clients on board.Adjusted EBITDA shows a loss of €9.0m  compared with a €6.1m loss in 2021. The global cost reduction plan launched in June 2022 had positive impacts from the second half of 2022  although these were not particularly visible in terms of the annual comparison between 2022 and 2021. For instance  in 2022  staff costs increased by €0.5m (+4.7%) compared with 2021  but decreased by -32% between the first half and second half of 2022. The total headcount at end-2022 was 87 people  compared with 184 at the end of 2021. The operating loss was reduced by €1.4m during the second half of the year compared with the first half of 2022.The following profit and loss items were impacted by non-recurring expenses and impairments. In accordance with IAS 36 and IAS 38  faced with the slowdown in the assisted reality market  which was confirmed in 2022  intangible assets were depreciated by €7.4m. Non-current expenses also include €1m linked to the reduction in the workforce (PSE employment protection plan). Factoring in these elements  AMA recorded an operating loss of -€20.8m for 2022. From the second half of 2022  AMA recognized all of its R&D expenditure as expenses. Following this pivotal year  AMA is positioned to set off again with new foundations in place for 2023.Financial structure at end-2022AMA had €8.6m of cash at end-2022. In view of the cost reduction measures rolled out  AMA is in a position to cover its cash requirements in 2023.

Nowadays  semiconductors are necessary for a wide range of consumer goods  including communication devices (including smartphones  tablets  smartwatches  & other gadgets)  computers (both household and business computers feature PCBs)  entertainment systems  and home appliances. Due to consumer electronics like laptops' high energy consumption  silicon carbide power semiconductors in fact are necessary. The devices' energy consumption is aided by SiC power semiconductors. The need for SiC power semiconductor devices is fueled by an increase in global energy consumption and the number of the consumer electronics devices.Restraints and ChallengesLack of Skilled Workforce to act as Market RestraintThe lack of skilled workforce  limitation of infrastructure  and high price of wafer may act as market restraints over the forecast period.Buy Full Research Report:https://www.marketresearchfuture.com/checkout?currency=one_user-USD&report_id=6441SiC Power Semiconductor Market SegmentationThe global SiC power semiconductor market is bifurcated based on device  wafer size  application and end user.By devices  the market is segmented into SiC Discrete Devices  MOSFET  Diode  Module  SiC Bare Die Devices.By wafer size  the market is segmented into 2-inch  4-inch  6-inch and aboveBy application  the market is segmented into RF Devices & Cellular Base Stations  Power Supply & Inverter  Power Grids  EV Motors  Industrial Motor Drives  and Railway Traction.By end user  automotive will lead the market over the forecast period.COVID-19 AnalysisDemand for SiC power semiconductors gradually decreased as a result of the lockdown and COVID-19 government rules  which forced the closure of production facilities and services. Even private and public development was put on hold. The supply chain disruption had an effect on the industry as well  especially for raw materials needed to produce SiC power semiconductors. The global market for SiC power semiconductors developed slowly in 2020 and the first two quarters of 2021  primarily as a result of stringent government regulations for different industries and restrictions on trade and transit.Government restrictions caused a slowdown in SiC power semiconductor production  which meant that during the first three quarters of 2020  supply did not keep up with demand. Also  there is a significant need for the SiC power semiconductor goods in the automotive and defense industries  as well as in the medical field and hydraulics applications. The oil and gas industry's resumed production and the automotive sector's increased output both contributed to the global increase in demand for the SiC power semiconductors. In turn  this increased the price of the product in addition to driving up demand.Regional AnalysisAPAC to Lead SiC Power Semiconductor MarketThe market in the APAC region holds the largest market share throughout the forecast period  at over 34.5%. Typically  Asia dominates the global semiconductor market. There is a good likelihood they will also control the SiC Power Semiconductor business on a global scale. Government regulations also align with the potential for growth in the market. Due to the existence of both producers and consumers  APAC also happens to be the largest market for consumer electronics. As a result  the region already benefits from a favorable ratio between supply and demand. The market will be primarily driven by the need for the wide bandgap IGBT semiconductors. In terms of the EV and automotive markets  Asia continues to hold the top spot. The need for the SiC semiconductors will eventually increase because China is already the place where the majority of the electric vehicles are produced. This will have an effect on the APAC region's overall market share. The entire production scope of the silicon carbide semiconductor within the APAC area will also be driven by suitable infrastructure and the continuously expanding production of electric vehicles supported by industry-friendly legislation and regulations in various nations like India  South Korea  and China.North America to Have Favorable Growth in SiC Power Semiconductor MarketDue to the vast number of renowned silicon carbide manufacturers & the enormous amount of money spent on R&D operations  North America has taken a share of 25% of the global market. The Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy in the United States plans to spend USD 30 million in at least 21 projects as part of the CIRCUITS initiative due to the rise in high power SiC applications.Check for Discount:https://www.marketresearchfuture.com/check-discount/6441Industry UpdatesDecember 2022- In order to design and produce cutting-edge semiconductor materials  STMicroelectronics and Soitec (Euronext Paris) have announced the next phase of their collaboration on Silicon Carbide substrates  along with the Soitec's SiC substrate technology’s qualification via ST planned in the following 18 months.

These results are in line with the outlook issued at the beginning of the year  thanks to the active management of our balance sheet and the transformation of our portfolio  with particular attention to asset rotation (disposal of offices and insurance agencies  in line with our outlook)  and to our active participation in the expansion and renewal of the healthcare real estate portfolio in Europe  while pursuing measures to achieve our ESG objectives.""PRESS RELEASEREGULATED INFORMATIONBrussels  28.04.2023  7:30 a.m. CET1. Summary of activity since 01.01.2023Cofinimmo has been acquiring  developing and managing rental properties for almost 40 years. Attentive to societal changes  Cofinimmo's permanent objective is to offer high-quality care  living and working spaces ('Caring  Living and Working - Together in Real Estate'). Capitalising on its expertise  Cofinimmo consolidates its leadership in European healthcare real estate.The pandemic that the world has been experiencing in recent years has highlighted the importance of the healthcare segment for each and every one of us. Through its investments  Cofinimmo is actively participating in the operation  maintenance  extension and renewal of the healthcare property portfolio in nine countries.During the 1st quarter  Cofinimmo made several investments (for 115 million EUR)  in line with the outlook1  in various healthcare real estate sub-segments in Europe. Thanks to these operations  healthcare real estate assets (4.5 billion EUR) account for 72% of the group's consolidated portfolio as at 31.03.2023  which reaches 6.3 billion EUR.Cofinimmo constantly evaluates its assets portfolio based on the key points of its strategy and the available market opportunities. In this context  the group carried out disposals for 54 million EUR  in line with the outlook  contributing to the reduction by 0.4% of the debt-to-assets ratio. These are noticeable in the office and property of distribution networks segments (of which the Cofinimur I portfolio of insurance agencies in France represents only 0.03% of the consolidated portfolio as at 31.03.2023  after disposals of more than 15 million EUR in 2023 and nearly 110 million EUR cumulatively since the process was launched in 2021).Cofinimmo has been adopting a proactive ESG policy for almost 15 years now. This is a real priority for the group  which once again distinguished itself in 2023. At the beginning of the year  Cofinimmo was selected by Euronext to be one of the 'Top SBTi 1.5°C ESG Bond issuers' and was included in the new Euronext Bel ESG Index. In addition  Cofinimmo further improved its ESG performance with the renewal of several ESG labels.In terms of financing  Cofinimmo reinforced its financial resources and its balance sheet structure during the last two financial years (cumulative capital increases of 565 million EUR in 2021 and 114 million EUR in 2022). The financing operations during this period enabled the group to improve the maturity timetable of its financial debts  to increase the amount of available financing  to maintain an average cost of debt at particularly low levels and to maintain their average residual maturity. In this respect  Cofinimmo carried out in January the last early refinancing for 2023 (90 million EUR)  to bring its maturity to 2030; there are therefore no further long-term debt maturities in 2023. The interest rate risk is hedged at 100% as at 31.03.2023 through the use of IRS and caps; the expected ratio for the period 2023-2027 is also high  ranging from 83% to 100% depending on the year. As at 31.03.2023  Cofinimmo had 764 million EUR of headroom on committed credit lines  after deduction of the backup of the commercial paper programme.The group's momentum in terms of investments and financing (average cost of debt at 1.4%)  coupled with efficient management of the existing portfolio in transformation (occupancy rate of 98.7%  gross rental income up 6.8% on a like-for-like basis due to recent indexations  which usually take place on the anniversary date of the contract  operating margin at 81.9%)  enabled the company to realise a net result from core activities - group share of 53 million EUR as at 31.03.2023  in line with the outlook (compared to the 51 million EUR that were made as at 31.03.2022  i.e. a 5% increase)  mainly due to the investments made  higher than the scope effect of disposals as well as the positive effect of contracts indexation. The net result from core activities - group share amounts to 1.62 EUR per share (in line with the outlook  compared to 1.60 EUR as at 31.03.2022)  taking into account the issuance of shares in 2022.

This will accelerate the approval process and potentially the launch of ZERVIATE in China.ZERVIATE is the first and only eye drop formulation of the antihistamine cetirizine  the active ingredient in ZYRTEC®  and is currently commercialized in the U.S. for ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis. The prescription market for allergic conjunctivitis products in China is expected to grow to almost $500 million by 2030. Ocumension is forecasting potential annual net sales of ZERVIATE >$100 million within 7 years.The ZERVIATE NDA in China is supported by the data package licensed by Nicox to Ocumension and an additional Chinese Phase 3 clinical trial of ZERVIATE run by Ocumension. ZERVIATE was compared to emedastine difumarate ophthalmic solution  0.05%  an antihistamine marketed under the brand name EMADINE®. ZERVIATE was found to be non-inferior to emedastine difumarate in the primary efficacy endpoint of change from baseline in the itching score in the 24 hours prior to the Day 14 visit. ZERVIATE was safe and well-tolerated with no difference in the proportion of patients with adverse events compared to emedastine difumarate.The priority review and approval process of NMPA is designed to expedite the approval of drugs that address unmet medical needs or have the potential to offer significant improvements over existing treatment options. The inclusion of ZERVIATE in the priority review and approval process of NMPA will accelerate the review and approval process of its new drug application  which is an important step towards commercialization of ZERVIATE.ZERVIATE is exclusively licensed to Ocumension Therapeutics for development and commercialization in the Chinese and the majority of the Southeast Asian markets. All costs of commercialization are borne by Ocumension and Nicox may potentially receive sales milestones of up to US$17.2 million together with royalties of between 5% and 9% of net sales of ZERVIATE by Ocumension.Ocumension’s Press Release can be found here.About NicoxNicox SA is an international ophthalmology company developing innovative solutions to help maintain vision and improve ocular health.

During the General Assembly that was held today the shareholders were informed of the concrete procedures relating to the optional dividend  including in particular the issue price and the option period.The capital increase through the contribution of dividend entitlements will take place on 25 May and will be realized within the scope of the authorised capital.This method of paying the dividend will allow to strengthen the group's equity  improve the balance sheet ratios and retain liquidities in order to continue the development of all the projects in portfolio.We are happy to announce that the group's major shareholders have expressed their intention to massively opt for the conversion of their dividend entitlements in capital.""Stéphan Sonneville SA  Managing DirectorThe General Assembly of the Shareholders held on 28 April 2023 decided to distribute a gross dividend of € 2.87 per share relating to FY 2022.The dividend net of withholding tax will amount to € 1.869 per ordinary share (30% withholding tax). The materialisation of this dividend will result in the creation of a number 18 coupon.Within the framework of this optional dividend  the shareholders will have the choice between:the contribution of their net dividend entitlements to the capital of Atenor  in exchange for new shares;the payment of the dividend in cash; ora combination of the two aforementioned options.In the event of the contribution of the net dividend entitlement to the capital  the issue price per new share is set at35.511 .It was based on the average closing stock market price of the share during the reference period (from 13 March 2023 till 24 April 2023 included) on the Euronext Brussels market  being € 46.10.This average price was then calculated with a discount on the issue price to the multiple of the net dividend of € 1.869  i.e. 19 shares.This multiple constitutes the exchange ratio (number of coupons necessary to subscribe a new share). The application of this multiple leads to the determination of the issue price  which provides a discount on the average price (cum coupon) of 22.97% (or a discount in relation to the average price ex coupon of 18.23%).The option period during which the shareholders can subscribe to the capital increase will take place from Monday  8 May 2023 till Monday  22 May 2023 at 16.00 (CET) included.Shareholders who do not express a choice during this option period and in the way stipulated for this purpose will receive the dividend in cash.The amount of the capital increase will be equal to the number of new shares to be issued multiplied by the issue price  being € 35.511 per Atenor share.The new shares will have the same form  the same ISIN code and will be listed on the same line as the existing shares.

By their nature  forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may occur in the future. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that are outside of our control and impossible to predict and may cause actual results to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations  estimates  forecasts  analyses and projections about the industry in which we operate and management's beliefs and assumptions about possible future events. You are cautioned not to put undue reliance on these forward-looking statements  which only express views as at the date of this press release and are neither predictions nor guarantees of possible future events or circumstances.We do not undertake any obligation to release publicly any revisions to these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this press release or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events  except as may be required under applicable securities law.Alternative performance measuresThe financial information in this release includes non-IFRS financial measures and ratios (e.g. non-IFRS metrics  such as adjusted EBITDA) that are not recognized as measures of financial performance or liquidity under IFRS. The non-IFRS financial measures presented are measures used by management to monitor the underlying performance of the business and operations and  have therefore not been audited or reviewed. Furthermore  they may not be indicative of the historical operating results  nor are they meant to be predictive of future results. These non-IFRS measures are presented because they are considered important supplementary measurements of FL Entertainment N.V.'s (the ""Company"") performance  and we believe that these and similar measures are widely used in the industry in which the Company operates as a way to evaluate a company’s operating performance and liquidity. Not all companies calculate non-IFRS financial measures in the same manner or on a consistent basis. As a result  these measures and ratios may not be comparable to measures used by other companies under the same or similar names.Regulated information related to this press release is available on the website:https://www.flentertainment.com/results-center/https://www.flentertainment.comAttachment",neutral,0.0,0.99,0.0,negative,0.0,0.1,0.89,True,English,"['2022 Universal Registration Document', 'FL Entertainment', 'Stichting Autoriteit Financiële Markten', 'growing online sports betting platform', '5 rue François 1er', 'largest independent producer distributor', 'EU Market Abuse Regulation', 'European Single Electronic Format', 'FL Entertainment N.V.', '30-year entertainment industry pioneer', '2022 Universal Registration Document', 'General Shareholders’ Meeting', 'Hugues Boëton', 'Stéphane Courbit', 'Betclic Everest Group', 'applicable securities law', 'FL Entertainment Group', 'historical operating results', '2022 Annual Financial Statements', 'possible future events', 'non-IFRS financial measures', 'Alternative performance measures', 'financial performance', 'non-IFRS measures', 'operating performance', 'financial information', 'future results', 'IFRS metrics', 'Q1 2023 results', 'actual results', 'official version', 'registered office', 'Investor Relations', 'Press Relations', 'Nicolas Grange', 'global leader', 'multimedia content', 'combined revenue', 'Euronext Amsterdam', 'FLE NA', 'FLE.AS', 'other factors', 'current expectations', 'undue reliance', 'unanticipated events', 'underlying performance', 'supplementary measurements', 'similar measures', 'consistent basis', 'similar names', 'ESEF format', 'Press Release', 'Forward-looking statements', 'inside information', 'Regulated information', 'Caroline Cohen', 'same manner', 'other companies', 'Management’ Report', 'Paris', '28 April', 'AFM', 'English', 'website', 'flentertainment', 'universal-registration', 'copies', 'France', 'Agenda', '30 May', '15 June', 'Phone', 'brunswickgroup', 'gaming', 'strengths', 'Banijay', 'world', 'EBITDA', 'July', 'ISIN', 'Bloomberg', 'Reuters', 'communication', 'meaning', 'Article', 'nature', 'risk', 'uncertainty', 'circumstances', 'known', 'uncertainties', 'control', 'estimates', 'forecasts', 'analyses', 'projections', 'beliefs', 'assumptions', 'views', 'date', 'predictions', 'guarantees', 'obligation', 'revisions', 'ratios', 'adjusted', 'liquidity', 'business', 'operations', 'Company', 'way', 'Attachment']",2023-04-28,2023-04-29,globenewswire.com

Clinical development Focus of the development strategy on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with the masitinib platform and on the second microtubule platform and seeking licensing agreements for non-rare disease indications of masitinib Filing of a marketing authorization application for masitinib in the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in Canada  under the Notice of Compliance with Conditions (NOC/c) policy and response to the Notice of Deficiency (NOD) Filing of a conditional marketing authorization application to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for masitinib in the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and response to the Day 120 assessment of the procedure in April 2023 Approval of both confirmatory Phase 3 studies with masitinib in progressive forms of multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease in Europe and in the US First complete bone marrow response in an acute myeloid leukemia patient in its AB8939 Phase I/II clinical trialParis  28 April 2023  6.30pm CET AB Science SA (Euronext - FR0010557264 - AB) today reports its revenues for the year 2022 and provides an update on its activities. CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT KEY EVENTS DURING THE YEAR 2022 AND SINCE DECEMBER 31  2022 Focus of the development strategy on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with the masitinib platform and on the second microtubule platform and seeking licensing agreements for non-rare disease indications of masitinib On 21 April 2023  AB Science announced its decision to focus its development strategy as follows: Allocation of current resources primarily to the development of masitinib for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and the development of the microtubule destabilizer agents (MDA) platform  with the clinical development of AB8939 in refractory acute myeloid leukemia and the initiation of regulatory preclinical development of a new oral molecule in the same microtubule class for sarcoma and solid tumors.AB Science wants to focus the majority of our clinical resources on the development of rare diseases with masitinib  on the development of the microtubule platform with AB8939 and future molecules of the same family due to the very encouraging first results. Acceleration of the process of seeking a license for masitinib in non-rare disease indications  with priority given to progressive forms of multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease.This acceleration is possible now that the confirmatory Phase 3 studies have been approved by the FDA in the United States and the major European agencies. To this end  the Company has retained the services of a leading investment bank. This license search is a priority in the Company's strategy  given the number of clinical studies already conducted and the maturity of the pipeline  and given the additional investments required to complete the clinical program  up to market authorizations. We want to highlight that the duration of this license search is not predictable and that the realization of a license is dependent on a number of factors and is not guaranteed. However  the milestones reached at this stage are essential factors that contribute to the feasibility of this strategy. As a result of the focus strategy  AB Science has decided to adapt its organization  which should lead to a significant reduction in costs. AB Science has therefore filed a redundancy plan to the authorities  aiming to cut a maximum of 41 jobs (out of a total of 100 employees). This strategic focus reinforces and sustains the existing agreement between certain shareholders of AB Science and Alain Moussy. Filing of a marketing authorization application for masitinib in the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in Canada  under the Notice of Compliance with Conditions (NOC/c) policy AB Science announced in February 2022 that Health Canada has granted authorization to file a New Drug Submission for masitinib in the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) under the Notice of Compliance with Conditions (NOC/c) policy. AB Science subsequently announced on May 26  2022 that Health Canada had issued a favorable opinion on the preliminary review of the dossier and that the review of the dossier had started. This assessment was made based on a pre-submission package sent by AB Science including  efficacy data of study AB10015  long-term survival data (75 months average follow-up from diagnosis) of study AB10015  and safety data. In December 2022  AB Science announced that it has received a Notice of Deficiency (“NOD”) from Health Canada. This NOD means that Health Canada has requested the provision of additional information related to masitinib New Drug Submission. Initially  AB Science had 90 days to respond to this NOD  but because EMA and Health Canada regulatory procedures were concurrent and in order to ensure the best quality of responses in both procedures  AB Science  in agreement with Health Canada  has extended the response period to Health Canada by 30 days. AB Science responded to this NOD. If granted  an NOC/c is authorization to market a drug with conditions. Such conditions will be discussed with Health Canada during the procedure. An estimated 3 000 Canadians are currently living with ALS. Each year approximately 1 000 Canadians die from ALS. A similar number of Canadians are diagnosed with ALS each year. Filing of a conditional marketing authorization application to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for masitinib in the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) AB Science announced in August 2022 that it has filed an application for conditional Marketing Authorization to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for masitinib in the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The application is based on results from the phase 2/3 AB10015 study and its long-term survival follow-up. Study AB10015 was a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial over a 48-week treatment period  conducted with 394 ALS patients and evaluating Alsitek in combination with riluzole versus riluzole alone. This application has been validated by EMA and review by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has begun. The CHMP has a target of 210 active evaluation days to review the application. In April 2023  AB Science announced it has submitted its responses to the Day 120 assessment of the procedure. Approval of confirmatory Phase 3 study with masitinib in p rogressive forms of multiple sclerosis AB Science announced in January 2022 that it has been authorized by the French Medicine Agency  ANSM  to initiate a Phase III study (AB20009) evaluating masitinib in patients with Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (PPMS) or non-active Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (nSPMS). This study has also been approved by several European agencies as well as by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The study will enroll 800 patients from numerous study centers with Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score between 3.0 to 6.0 and absence of T1 Gadolinium-enhancing brain lesions as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The primary objective of the study will be to evaluate the effect of masitinib on time to confirmed disability progression  with progression defined as 1-point worsening when EDSS baseline score ≤5.5  or 0.5 if baseline score >5.5 from randomization to week 96. This confirmatory study follows successful completion of a first Phase 2B/3 study (AB07002) in primary progressive (PPMS) and non-active secondary progressive (nSPMS) multiple sclerosis. This study met its primary analysis endpoint  demonstrating a statistically significant reduction in cumulative change on EDSS with masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/day (p=0.0256). Approval of confirmatory Phase 3 study with masitinib in Alzheimer's disease AB Science announced in October 2022 that the first authorizations have been received to initiate its phase 3 confirmatory study (AB21004) evaluating masitinib in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's Disease (AD) from the French Medicine Agency (ANSM) together with AEMPS (Spain agency) and EOF (Greece agency). This study has also been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Study AB21004 is a randomized  double-blind phase 3 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of masitinib in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease  as an add-on therapy to standard of care  cholinesterase inhibitors and/or memantine. The study will enroll 600 patients with confirmed clinical diagnosis of mild and moderate Alzheimer's disease  corresponding to an Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) score of less than 73 and a Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of between 14 to 25  inclusive. The objective of study AB21004 is to confirm treatment effect with masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/day as an adjunct to cholinesterase inhibitor and/or memantine in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease. The primary endpoint of the study will be to evaluate the effect of masitinib on absolute change from baseline in ADCS-ADL score and in ADAS-Cog-11. This confirmatory study follows a first positive Phase 2B/3 study (AB09004) which showed that masitinib can generate a significant treatment effect relative to placebo in the primary endpoint of change from baseline in ADAS-Cog  an instrument that measures the effect on cognition and memory. First complete bone marrow response in a n acute myeloid leukemia patient in its AB8939 Phase I/II clinical trial AB Science announced in March 2023 a case report from the initial stage of its Phase I/II study (AB18001) evaluating AB8939  a microtubule destabilizer  in patients with refractory and relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The AML patient in question was in failure to prior treatment with azacitidine and presented with a MECOM gene rearrangement  which is a biomarker for resistance to standard chemotherapies that is associated with a high-risk of disease progression and inferior prognosis. One month after the first treatment cycle (i.e.  three consecutive days of AB8939 treatment) there was a drastic reduction in bone marrow blast cells (i.e.  leukemia cells)  from a pretreatment level of 55% to 5% (i.e.  a morphologic leukemia free state). Remarkably  this response was achieved at a very low dose of AB8939  corresponding to the second step of dose increment (out of 13 potential steps) in phase I. The patient also showed excellent tolerance to AB8939  having experienced no treatment-related toxicities. At the request of the investigator  AB Science has authorized further treatment cycles of AB8939 to this patient. One month after the second treatment cycle of three consecutive days at this dose  a good response has been maintained with bone marrow blasts being at 10% (corresponding to a 5-fold reduction relative to baseline). A third treatment cycle for this patient has been initiated. Considering the overall study to date  there have been no signs of moderate  severe or serious toxicity and approximately 50% of patients have requested further treatment cycles of AB8939 after the first cycle of treatment and a measurement at day 28. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION FOR THE YEAR 2022 The operating result at 31 December 2022 was a loss of €15 937k  compared with a loss of €13 808k as of 31 December 2021  an increase in the operating loss of €2 129k (15.4%). Operating income  exclusively made up of revenues related to the operation of a drug in veterinary medicine  amounted to €958k as of 31 December 2022  compared to €1 607k a year earlier.Operating expenses amounted to €16 896k as of 31 December 2022  compared to €15 415k as of 31 December 2021  an increase of 9.6%.Marketing expenses were stable compared to 31 December 2021  rising from €493k at 31 December 2021 to €480k as of 31 December 2022.Administrative expenses decreased by 15% from €3 578k as of 31 December 2021 to €3 040k as of 31 December 2022.Research and development costs increased by €2 112k  or 18.8%  from €11 233k as of 31 December 2021 to €13 345k as of 31 December 2022.The gain of €2 326k at 31 December 2022 is mainly related to the recognition of the change in fair value between 31 December 2022 and 31 December 2021 of the preference shares resulting from the conversion of the bonds in December 2016 (class C)  i.e. a financial gain of €2 557k with no impact on cash for the period. The consolidated net loss at 31 December 2022 is €13 615k compared to a loss of €14 463k as of 31 December 2021  a decrease of 5.9%.

The Capital Increase consisted of a private placement pursuant to Articles L. 225-136 of the French Commercial Code and L. 411-2 1° of the French Monetary and Financial Code and has been carried out with a waiver of preferential subscription rights  pursuant to the delegation of authority granted to the Board of Directors under the 20th resolution of the Combined General Shareholders’ Meeting of June 29  2022. The Capital Increase has taken the form of the issuance of 2 608 686 actions new ordinary shares (the “New Shares”) to each of which are attached a share subscription warrant (the “Warrants”). The Capital Increase was made through a cash contribution of approximately EUR 11.5 million and by offsetting existing receivables  i.e. approximately EUR 3.0 million (receivables related to the pre-financing of the research tax credit for the 2020 financial year and maturing in 2023  as well as approximately EUR 500 000 in interest accrued to date on the convertible bonds issued in February 2022). Two warrants giving the right to subscribe to one ordinary share  all of the 2 608 686 New Shares and all of the 1 304 343 new shares that would be issued upon exercise of the warrants  i.e. a total of 3 913 029 shares in the Company  represent 7.36% of the Company's current share capital. The issue price of the New Shares has been set at 5.75 euros (0.01 euro par value and 5.74 euros issue premium) and the exercise price of the Warrants at 8.625 euros  representing a total fundraising of approximately EUR 15.0 million (taking into account the exercise of the warrants  the maximum amount of the Capital Increase could be increased by an amount of 26.3 million euros). The Warrants may be exercised from January 1st  2025 to December 31  2030. Drawdown of the first two tranches for a total amount of €12 million under its financing agreement with the European Investment Bank AB Science announced in December 2022 that it has received payment of €6.0 million as the first tranche of a €15 million loan from the European Investment Bank (EIB). AB Science announced in January 2023 that it has received payment of €6.0 million as the second tranche of the EIB loan. The agreement signed with the EIB provides a financing in two tranches of EUR 6.0 million and a third tranche of EUR 3.0 million  each subject to the fulfillment of certain conditions precedent  which have been satisfied for the first two tranches. Each tranche is accompanied by the issue of warrants  the number of which is calculated in relation to a reference price of 14 euros according to the following formula : Number of warrants = Amount of the tranche / (14 x m) with m = 3.4 for tranche 1 and 3.7 for tranche 2. The first tranche has a maturity of six years and is therefore repayable in December 2028. It carries a capitalized annual interest rate of 9.0% and the issuance of 126 050 warrants  each giving the right to subscribe to one ordinary share of AB Science at 8.61 euros for 15 years. These warrants represent 0.24% of the current capital of the Company (if they were to be exercised in their entirety). The second tranche  also of EUR 6.0 million  has a maturity of five years and is therefore repayable in January 2028. It carries a capitalized annual interest rate of 7.0% and the issuance of 115 830 warrants  each giving the right to subscribe to one ordinary share of AB Science at 14.0 euros for 15 years. These warrants represent 0.22% of the current capital of the Company (if they were to be exercised in their entirety). Renewal of the Programme d’Augmentation de Capital à Terme ( PACT ) concluded with Alpha Blue Ocean Alpha Blue Ocean is committed to subscribe  from the date of publication of the 2022 annual report  to newly issued shares of AB Science (in tranches comprised of a number of shares between 500 000 and 1 million) over a period of 24 months  up to a maximum of 4.0 million shares in total (or 7.2% of the company’s share capital on the basis of the capital after the capital increase announced on 24 April 2023). Such subscriptions for new shares shall be carried out using the 28th resolution of the Shareholder’s Meeting of June 29  2022 (as renewed or otherwise amended  if applicable). By way of example  based on the April 27  2023 closing price of AB Science’s shares  i.e 6.27 euros  on Euronext Paris  it is estimated that AB Science could raise approximately 25 million euros through this equity financing facility. For each tranche  the issuance price of new shares of AB Science  subscribed by Alpha Blue Ocean  shall be equal to 100% of the volume-weighted average price of the shares of AB Science traded on Euronext Paris over the three trading days preceding a tranche drawdown request. For each tranche  and after the settlement-delivery of the new shares of AB Science following the relevant capital increase  80% of the proceeds of the tranche shall be secured in an escrow account with a third-party escrow agent. The remaining balance shall be kept by AB Science. Following predefined trading rules for each tranche  Alpha Blue Ocean shall manage the orderly sale  on or off the market  of the AB Science shares subscribed to. 95% of the proceeds shall be distributed to AB Science on a monthly basis (minus a structuration fee)  directly from Alpha Blue Ocean or by way of a release from the escrow account. AB Science has no obligations to draw down on the PACT and shall utilise this innovative financing solution only if necessary and if the market conditions are favourable to the interests of AB Science and its shareholders. For each drawdown  the number of shares issued with respect to this agreement and admitted to trading will be reported in an Euronext notice and in a specific communication on AB Science’s website. Investors are invited to take note of the risks associated with this transaction  potentially dilutive of 7.2% of the company’s share capital on the basis of the capital after the capital increase announced on 24 April 2023  which could create downward pressure on the AB Science share  as mentioned in sections 6.4.4 and 6.4.6 of the 2022 annual report. Investors are also invited to be vigilant before taking the decision to invest in a company that carries out such operations  particularly when they are carried out successively. AB Science recalls that the present dilutive financing operation is not the first one it has put in place. Restructuring of convertible bonds issued in February 2022 and Class C preferred shares AB Science announced on 21 April 2023 the negotiation of a framework agreement under which the terms and conditions of the bond issue agreement (entered into with the holders of the US$8.5 million convertible bonds issued in February 2022 and to which 50 000 warrants were attached with an exercise price of 000 warrants with an exercise price of EUR 12.65) would be amended to provide  on 15 July 2023 and automatically  for the conversion of all the convertible bonds into ordinary shares of AB Science on the basis of a price per share of EUR 5.75 (i.e. the subscription price of the New Shares). A framework agreement has also been negotiated with the holders of Class C preferred shares (the “C Preferred”). The C Preferred still in circulation would be repurchased by AB Science for one symbolic euro (and subsequently cancelled). 520 786 share warrants (each warrant entitling the holder to subscribe for one ordinary share of AB Science at par value for a period of 12 months) will be issued in substitution of the C Preferred. In addition  still in substitution of the C Preferred  a new class of preferred shares would be created  benefiting from priority dividend rights (equal to 1.25% of the net sales of masitinib or of any licensing royalties  up to a limit of 9.0 million euros) and convertible into 750 000 ordinary shares of AB Science if the share price of AB Science exceeds a threshold of 30 euros for more than 90 consecutive days. These agreements will be submitted to AB Science shareholders for approval at the next annual general shareholders meeting  Alain Moussy having declared that he was in favour of the planned restructuring. Finally  it will be proposed to the shareholders to extend the term of certain lines of warrants already issued  to adapt to the evolution of AB Science’s strategy and of its clinical pipeline. Decision of the Enforcement Committee of the French market regulator (AMF) following the investigation relating to the financial information and the market for AB Science shares  opened in September 20 17 On March 24  2022  the AMF Enforcement Committee ruled that there was no privileged information  neither at the time of the two capital increases carried out by AB Science on March 24 and 27  2017  nor at the time Alain Moussy sold a part of his shares on March 31  2017. The AMF Enforcement Committee therefore completely exonerated Alain Moussy  prosecuted for insider trading  and found that AB Science had not failed to comply with its disclosure obligations at the time of these capital increases in March 2017. The AMF Enforcement Committee nevertheless considered that AB Science should have communicated as early as April 7  2017 the high probability of a negative opinion from the European Medicine Agency (EMA) on the marketing authorization application for masitinib for the treatment of mastocytosis and ordered AB Science to pay the sum of one million euros. In application of its internal procedures  AB Science had nevertheless put in place a deferral of privileged information from this date of April 7  2017  considering that the delay in communication was in the interest of the Company and in line with industry practices of not communicating before the final vote of the CHMP  or else withdrawing the registration dossier  which AB Science had no intention to do. Given this difference in assessment concerning a technical point relating to one of the criteria for the deferred communication of privileged information  as well as the amount of penalty  AB Science has decided to appeal to the Paris Court of Appeal. The President of AMF also appealed against the Enforcement Committee's decision. It concerns in particular the exoneration of Alain Moussy.

We continue to work hard to reduce this historical debt to less than 3x EBITDA by 2023  while remaining committed to building a world class IOT integrator on the remnants of the 'once great and glorious' foundations of Option NV  Zenitel/Sait and Remoticom BV.To achieve this goal  we initially targeted a highly focused leadership in smart lighting applications and acquired Remoticom in early 2022 to implement an OEM strategy of integrated solutions (drivers+controllers+sensors). Now a year later  Remoticom has nearly doubled its sales (3.4 million) and continues to grow rapidly  not just in the Benelux. During much of 2022  however  some painful supply chain issues (China) weighted on profitability  but these have since been largely resolved  justifying optimism of a higher contribution in 2023. We plan to further merge and integrate Option and Remoticom into a single company  combining Option's technology capabilities with Remoticom's marketing and business development skills.At Option  we embarked on an ambitious program to renew and rejuvenate our CloudGate platform through the development and sale of ""light hotspots"" for the Helium network in the US. We succeeded in certifying and releasing a high-end LORA gateway platform (with superior range)  but the markets collapsed causing significant delays to the project only to be released for sale in April of 2023. We invested heavily in this platform  which is generic and strategic  but has fallen short in 2022. In addition to the Helium platform  we are further expanding our CloudGate range to include parking sensors  motion and leak detection devices and energy management systems. The emerging IOT space undoubtedly offers numerous other opportunities.Finally  in recent years we have developed a broad-based software platform for the leisure market (with webshop and classes scheduling; access control  ticketing and digital payment facilities for multiple venues) as part of a strategy to gradually evolve our services division from just ""managed services"" to ""software as a service"" capabilities. This leisure platform is a gem of software integration and will fuel our ambitions to deploy such software services in the broader leisure market.With such growth engines  Crescent is well positioned to continue to grow rapidly and profitably. We are targeting double-digit growth in both revenue and double-digit profitability. We remain confident that we will continue to turn the odds and win over skeptics this year. Yes  financing remains a significant challenge  but most of the work is now behind us and those who were brave enough to believe in our story will eventually reap the rewards of their resilience and patience.Results of the yearThe sales and EBITDA of the three divisions were:The revenues of the Solutions division increased by EUR 5 132k  of which EUR 3 454k was inorganic due to the addition of Remoticom. Organic revenues increased by EUR 1 678k (+23.5%)  of which EUR 1 million came from the increase in Option's base CloudGate business  and EUR 0.4 million from increased integration revenue at SAIT  EUR 0.2 million from revenue to the Smartville partnership and EUR 0.13 million from increased revenue at Maro from solar panel installations.The decline in sales in the Services division was mainly due to completion in 2021 of a major ICT migration project in Belgium  resulting in a decrease of project-based IT services by 12% in 2022. Whereas recurring ICT services remained flat as all software integration services (sales of €0.5 million).Revenues in the Lighting division grew 16% compared to 2021  as realized primarily in the Dutch home market. Thanks to this revenue growth  stable gross margins and reduced operating costs  the division managed to contribute EUR 368k to group EBITDA.

By their nature  forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may occur in the future. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that are outside of our control and impossible to predict and may cause actual results to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations  estimates  forecasts  analyses and projections about the industry in which we operate and management's beliefs and assumptions about possible future events. You are cautioned not to put undue reliance on these forward-looking statements  which only express views as at the date of this press release and are neither predictions nor guarantees of possible future events or circumstances.We do not undertake any obligation to release publicly any revisions to these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this press release or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events  except as may be required under applicable securities law.Alternative performance measuresThe financial information in this release includes non-IFRS financial measures and ratios (e.g. non-IFRS metrics  such as adjusted EBITDA) that are not recognized as measures of financial performance or liquidity under IFRS. The non-IFRS financial measures presented are measures used by management to monitor the underlying performance of the business and operations and  have therefore not been audited or reviewed. Furthermore  they may not be indicative of the historical operating results  nor are they meant to be predictive of future results. These non-IFRS measures are presented because they are considered important supplementary measurements of FL Entertainment N.V.'s (the ""Company"") performance  and we believe that these and similar measures are widely used in the industry in which the Company operates as a way to evaluate a company’s operating performance and liquidity. Not all companies calculate non-IFRS financial measures in the same manner or on a consistent basis. As a result  these measures and ratios may not be comparable to measures used by other companies under the same or similar names.Regulated information related to this press release is available on the website:https://www.flentertainment.com/results-center/https://www.flentertainment.comAttachment",neutral,0.12,0.88,0.0,positive,0.79,0.2,0.01,True,English,"['Annual General Meeting', 'FL Entertainment', 'rue François 1er', 'M.A.J.

The Project Business was strong in EuropeEBITDA of €2.9M  down to 10.9% of S ales due to the change in product mix and overall inflation in operating costsNet income down to €( 3.0)M mainly due to the recognition of an impairment loss on the goodwill without impact on cash position of the company .Net financial debt contained at 26% of equity at 31 December 2022Expected recovery in the second half of 2023Brussels  28 April 2023 (17.45) - COIL  world leader in aluminium anodising  has released its annual results for the 2022 financial year.Significant events of the financial yearIn a very uncertain macro-economic environment  with the return of high inflation and the outbreak of war in Ukraine and Russia  COIL's activities in 2022 were strongly influenced by volatility in the aluminium flat rolled products business in Europe.The temporary shortage of metal caused by the post-COVID19 recovery resulted in exceptionally long delivery times from rolling mills  which led distributors to overstock and triggered a very sharp rise in aluminium prices. The aluminium price peaked in Q2. Then  with the reduction in supply times  the price fell very sharply  leading distributors to reduce their stocks to more normal levels.In this context  the Company's Tolling Sales (77% of 2022 sales) evolved according to the imbalance between supply and demand. After a solid first half (+18.5%)  they fell sharply in the second half (-13.2%) due to the full impact of the slowdown in demand from distributors. Over the year as a whole  Tolling Sales nonetheless grew by 2%.Package Sales  which include metal (23% of 2022 sales)  recovered strongly during the year (+19%). This recovery was due to the sustained development of sales in Europe  with significant deliveries  which compensated for the lack of orders in Russia and sluggish invoicing in Asia. The Company expects the Asian markets to recover in 2023 with the reopening of borders and the delivery of several new projects.The shift in the product mix towards Package Sales and the significant increases in energy and raw material costs significantly impacted the Gross Margin and results  despite price increases implemented by the Company during the year to tackle inflation.The Company rationalised its resources and consolidated its production on a limited number of lines by focusing its operations on its Landen site in Belgium and its high-efficiency line 6 in Germany.At the same time  the Company boosted its investments to improve its energy efficiency. In partnership with local renewable energy operators  the Company commissioned a photovoltaic park at its Bernburg site in Germany in October 2022  which provides 20% of the electricity consumed by the site at competitive costs.ResultsSales for the 2022 financial year increased by 6% compared to the previous year and amounted to €26.7M.Despite the increase in revenue  the EBITDA decreased by - €3.4M to €2.9M  or 10.9% of sales compared to 24.8% in 2021. This change is mainly explained by i) the decrease in gross margin due to the change in the product mix and the strong increase in variable production costs  in particular those related to energy and raw materials  and ii) the increase in operating expenses  in particular  with arise in payroll costs.Income from ordinary operations is close to break-even at €(0.1)M  compared with a profit of €2.8M in 2021.Operating profit came to a loss of €(2.6)M. In 2022  it is impacted by non-current charges of €2.5 million due to an unrealized loss on the goodwill of continuous anodising assets. This recognition of the impairment loss is the result of a change in market conditions and the application of certain IFRS accounting standards1. It should be noted that this impairment loss does not have any impact on the cash position of the company.The net result is a loss of €(3.0)M. It includes financial charges of €0.3M  compared with €0.6M in 2021.Summary income statement(€M) 2022 2021 Variation Sales 26.7 25.2 + 6 % Tolling Sales 20.6 20.1 + 2 % Package Sales2 5.9 5.1 + 18 % EBITDA 2.9 6.3 - €3.4 M % of sales 10.9% 24.8% Income from ordinary operations (0.1) 2.8 - €2.9 M % of sales (0.4)% 11.1% Operating result (2.6) 2.8 - €5.4 M % of sales (9.9)% 11.1% Pre-tax result (2.9) 2.2 - €5.1 M Net result (3.0) 2.1 - €5.0 M % of sales (11.2)% 8.1%Balance sheetShareholders' equity stood at €23.6M at 31 December 2022  down €5.6M on 31 December 2021  owing to the year's loss (-€3.0M) and the interim dividend paid in September 2022 (-€2.8M). Net financial debt at 31 December 2022 was €6.1M (+€2.2M compared to 2021) and remained at acceptable levels  representing 26% of equity  compared to 13% at 31 December 2021.2023 first-quarter sales and outlookThe first quarter of 2023 followed the trend observed at the end of 2022. Quarterly sales amounted to €6.4M  down 3.2% compared with the first quarter of 2022. Package Sales maintained their growth momentum with sales (€1.7M) up +37.3%  while Tolling Sales continued to suffer from the destocking by metal distributors  particularly against a high comparison base (€4.7M; -12.3%).In an uncertain global economic environment  COIL maintains a cautious approach to 2023 and anticipates lower demand for tolling services in the first half compared to the previous year  as distributors continue to consume their stocks and stronger competition emerges in the European continuous anodising market.In the short term  the Company has taken steps to limit the impact of the slowdown on margins in tolling activities by increasing its prices in line with inflation  continuing to optimise its variable cost base and supporting the commercial development of its Package offers.Energy prices have fallen in 2023  but the outlook remains uncertain. The company’s electro-chemical process means a high energy consumption. The Company is looking to render energy prices variable in its tolling business.The Company continues to seek partnerships to replace its fossil fuel consumption with competitive renewable energy sources  with the aim of achieving carbon neutrality at the Bernburg site. After the commissioning of a photovoltaic park in 2022  the Company is in discussions with a sector operator to purchase green energy for 30% of the energy consumption in Germany. A similar action plan is under consideration in Belgium. These actions will contribute to achieving significant savings in the long term as well as increasing consumption of energy from green resources.Investments made over the last few years and the flexibility of its industrial plant will enable it to react efficiently to market improvements from the second half of 2023.In the medium to long term  the Company is confident in its development prospects by capitalising on its broad portfolio of premium  sustainable and low carbon footprint products to increase the potential of its business.Additional informationThe financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors on 27 April 2023.

It gives the metal excellent resistance to corrosion and/or reinforces its functional qualities. Anodising preserves all the natural and ecological properties of aluminium; it retains its high rigidity and excellent strength-to-weight ratio  its non-magnetic properties  its exceptional resistance to corrosion. The metal remains totally and repeatedly recyclable through simple re-melting. Anodised aluminium is used in a wide variety of industries and applications: architecture  design  manufacturing and the automotive sector.COIL deploys an industrial model that creates value by leveraging its unique know-how  its operational excellence  the quality of its investments and the expertise of its people. COIL has around 120 employees in Belgium and Germany and generated a turnover of €26 5 million in 2022.Listed on Euronext Growth Paris | Isin: BE0160342011 | Reuters: ALCOI.PA | Bloomberg: ALCOI: FPFor more information  please visit www.aloxide.comContactCOILTim Hutton | Chief Executive Officertim.hutton@coil.be | Tel.: +32 (0)11 88 01 88 CALYPTUSCyril Combecyril.combe@calyptus.net | Tel.: +33 (0)1 53 65 68 681 The recognition of this unrealised impairment loss results from the application of the IAS36 standard. This standard prescribes that an entity is obliged to reduce the asset value (in casu  the goodwill value related to the continuous anodising unit) to ensure that the asset is carried at no more than its recoverable amount. Such reduction qualifies as an impairment loss  which does not have any impact on the cash position of the company.2 Anodising and metal included.Attachment,neutral,0.01,0.94,0.05,mixed,0.16,0.05,0.79,True,English,"['LOWER RESULTS', 'ECONOMIC FACTORS', 'EXCEPTIONAL CHARGES', 'COIL', 'local renewable energy operators', 'French English Dutch', 'uncertain macro-economic environment', 'several new projects', 'IFRS accounting standards', 'continuous anodising assets', 'The Project Business', 'Net financial debt', 'raw material costs', 'solid first half', 'Summary income statement', 'M Net result', 'long delivery times', 'variable production costs', 'products business', 'raw materials', 'first quarter', 'operating costs', 'competitive costs', 'payroll costs', 'Net income', 'second half', 'financial charges', 'aluminium anodising', 'ECONOMIC FACTORS', 'EXCEPTIONAL CHARGES', 'Tolling Activity', 'S ales', 'product mix', 'cash position', 'world leader', 'Significant events', 'temporary shortage', 'rolling mills', 'sharp rise', 'supply times', 'normal levels', 'sustained development', 'significant deliveries', 'sluggish invoicing', 'Asian markets', 'significant increases', 'Gross Margin', 'limited number', 'high-efficiency line', 'same time', 'energy efficiency', 'photovoltaic park', 'operating expenses', 'current charges', 'market conditions', 'Package Sales2', 'Operating result', 'Balance sheet', 'interim dividend', 'acceptable levels', '2022 financial year', 'aluminium prices', 'overall inflation', 'high inflation', 'price increases', 'Landen site', 'Bernburg site', 'ordinary operations', 'The Company', 'impairment loss', 'unrealized loss', 'LOWER RESULTS', 'annual results', 'previous year', 'Operating profit', 'Tolling Sales', 'Variation Sales', '2023 first-quarter sales', 'Quarterly sales', 'distributor demand', 'post-COVID19 recovery', 'full impact', 'strong increase', ""Shareholders' equity"", '2022 sales', 'Europe', 'EBITDA', 'change', 'recognition', 'goodwill', '31 December', 'Brussels', '28 April', 'COIL', 'return', 'outbreak', 'war', 'Ukraine', 'Russia', 'activities', 'volatility', 'metal', 'distributors', 'Q2.', 'reduction', 'stocks', 'context', 'imbalance', 'slowdown', 'lack', 'orders', 'reopening', 'shift', 'resources', 'lines', 'Belgium', 'Germany', 'investments', 'partnership', 'October', 'electricity', 'revenue', 'decrease', 'application', 'September', 'trend']",2023-04-28,2023-04-29,globenewswire.com

Faced with difficulties predicting the development of our market  we recorded accounting impairments which affected our earnings. Nevertheless  our cash management was improved through the cost reduction measures rolled out  effective from the second half of 2022. This was accomplished while maintaining an international commercial strategy and continuing to improve our software solutions. For instance  we further enhanced our XpertEye solution with a number of additional features  while making it simpler to use thanks to the On & Live concept. We also improved our commercial offering through initiatives aimed at facilitating the widespread adoption of different uses of our solutions. These key steps forward enabled us to successfully renew virtually all of the projects started in 2020 with our most significant clients and to further expand our client base. In view of these developments  combined with the continued improvement in the quality and price of the hardware associated with our solutions  orders are expected to pick up again in 2023”.2022 earningsAMA recorded revenues of €4.3m in 2022  compared with €6.6m in 2021  down 34.8% at current exchange rates. This trend continues to reflect the wait-and-see approach adopted by clients faced with an unfavorable economic environment.The percentage of revenues generated by Software  AMA’s core business with its XpertEye platform  increased by +5% (at current exchange rates) compared with 2021  climbing to 63% of revenues for the year (versus 37% in 2021)  for a total of €2.6m. However  the percentage of Hardware revenues contracted by 63% to represent 27% of 2022 revenues  compared with 46% the previous year  for a total of €1.1m. Hardware comprises a range of equipment (connected glasses  external video sources  etc.) supplied by third parties that complement the use of XpertEye.In 2022  AMA further strengthened its client base  with 497 clients  up from 490 in 2021. AMA consolidated its positions with its existing clients  primarily major groups (e.g. Merck  Alstom  Air Liquide  Boehringer  KPMG)  by renewing the vast majority of the significant contracts signed in 2020  but with lower average basket values  linked in particular to the non-renewal of Hardware. The churn rate remained limited to 7.9% of 2021 revenues and corresponded primarily to clients representing €4.2k of revenues on average over the year. In 2022  AMA welcomed 119 new clients on board.Adjusted EBITDA shows a loss of €9.0m  compared with a €6.1m loss in 2021. The global cost reduction plan launched in June 2022 had positive impacts from the second half of 2022  although these were not particularly visible in terms of the annual comparison between 2022 and 2021. For instance  in 2022  staff costs increased by €0.5m (+4.7%) compared with 2021  but decreased by -32% between the first half and second half of 2022. The total headcount at end-2022 was 87 people  compared with 184 at the end of 2021. The operating loss was reduced by €1.4m during the second half of the year compared with the first half of 2022.The following profit and loss items were impacted by non-recurring expenses and impairments. In accordance with IAS 36 and IAS 38  faced with the slowdown in the assisted reality market  which was confirmed in 2022  intangible assets were depreciated by €7.4m. Non-current expenses also include €1m linked to the reduction in the workforce (PSE employment protection plan). Factoring in these elements  AMA recorded an operating loss of -€20.8m for 2022. From the second half of 2022  AMA recognized all of its R&D expenditure as expenses. Following this pivotal year  AMA is positioned to set off again with new foundations in place for 2023.Financial structure at end-2022AMA had €8.6m of cash at end-2022. In view of the cost reduction measures rolled out  AMA is in a position to cover its cash requirements in 2023. AMA also has €16m of unused credit lines.2023 first-quarter revenues and launch of the new commercial offeringFor the first quarter of 2023  AMA is reporting unaudited consolidated revenues of €0.8m at constant exchange rates (-24% versus Q1 2022). The majority of the new commercial offers were rolled out in March and therefore did not impact the first quarter. However  the amounts of software orders are still trending up  reflecting the positive response to the new Enterprise Model commercial offer  designed to facilitate the XpertEye solution’s larger-scale deployment in major groups.Outlook for 2023AMA aims to continue moving forward with its commercial development strategy  while maintaining a streamlined cost structure.To contribute to the emergence of assisted reality solutions for frontline workers and provide businesses  major groups and institutions with solutions to meet the challenges linked to productivity  savings and managing climate impacts  AMA:is further strengthening its key partnerships with organizations such as Orange Business  which are increasingly contributing to the distribution and use of XpertEye solutions  as well as Soti  Akila  Thalos  inUSe and Rofim for software integration  and Cellnex  HubOne  Dust or Inmarsat for network connectivity aspects.is offering new commercial initiatives at the start of 2023  including free trial offers and the Enterprise Model  with a view to accelerating XpertEye’s distribution and use through packages of licenses and volume-based offers.Accentuates specific actions and concrete data information enabling its customers to use XpertEye as a real accelerator of their digital and ecological transition.

To this end  the Company has retained the services of a leading investment bank.This license search is a priority in the Company's strategy  given the number of clinical studies already conducted and the maturity of the pipeline  and given the additional investments required to complete the clinical program  up to market authorizations. We want to highlight that the duration of this license search is not predictable and that the realization of a license is dependent on a number of factors and is not guaranteed. However  the milestones reached at this stage are essential factors that contribute to the feasibility of this strategy.As a result of the focus strategy  AB Science has decided to adapt its organization  which should lead to a significant reduction in costs. AB Science has therefore filed a redundancy plan to the authorities  aiming to cut a maximum of 41 jobs (out of a total of 100 employees).This strategic focus reinforces and sustains the existing agreement between certain shareholders of AB Science and Alain Moussy.Filing of a marketing authorization application for masitinib in the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in Canada  under the Notice of Compliance with Conditions (NOC/c) policyAB Science announced in February 2022 that Health Canada has granted authorization to file a New Drug Submission for masitinib in the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) under the Notice of Compliance with Conditions (NOC/c) policy. AB Science subsequently announced on May 26  2022 that Health Canada had issued a favorable opinion on the preliminary review of the dossier and that the review of the dossier had started.This assessment was made based on a pre-submission package sent by AB Science including  efficacy data of study AB10015  long-term survival data (75 months average follow-up from diagnosis) of study AB10015  and safety data.In December 2022  AB Science announced that it has received a Notice of Deficiency (""NOD"") from Health Canada. This NOD means that Health Canada has requested the provision of additional information related to masitinib New Drug Submission. Initially  AB Science had 90 days to respond to this NOD  but because EMA and Health Canada regulatory procedures were concurrent and in order to ensure the best quality of responses in both procedures  AB Science  in agreement with Health Canada  has extended the response period to Health Canada by 30 days. AB Science responded to this NOD.If granted  an NOC/c is authorization to market a drug with conditions. Such conditions will be discussed with Health Canada during the procedure.An estimated 3 000 Canadians are currently living with ALS. Each year approximately 1 000 Canadians die from ALS. A similar number of Canadians are diagnosed with ALS each year.Filing of a conditional marketing authorization application to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for masitinib in the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)AB Science announced in August 2022 that it has filed an application for conditional Marketing Authorization to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for masitinib in the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The application is based on results from the phase 2/3 AB10015 study and its long-term survival follow-up. Study AB10015 was a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial over a 48-week treatment period  conducted with 394 ALS patients and evaluating Alsitek in combination with riluzole versus riluzole alone.This application has been validated by EMA and review by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has begun. The CHMP has a target of 210 active evaluation days to review the application.In April 2023  AB Science announced it has submitted its responses to the Day 120 assessment of the procedure.Approval of confirmatory Phase 3 study with masitinib in p rogressive forms of multiple sclerosisAB Science announced in January 2022 that it has been authorized by the French Medicine Agency  ANSM  to initiate a Phase III study (AB20009) evaluating masitinib in patients with Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (PPMS) or non-active Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (nSPMS).This study has also been approved by several European agencies as well as by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).The study will enroll 800 patients from numerous study centers with Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score between 3.0 to 6.0 and absence of T1 Gadolinium-enhancing brain lesions as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).The primary objective of the study will be to evaluate the effect of masitinib on time to confirmed disability progression  with progression defined as 1-point worsening when EDSS baseline score =5.5  or 0.5 if baseline score >5.5 from randomization to week 96.This confirmatory study follows successful completion of a first Phase 2B/3 study (AB07002) in primary progressive (PPMS) and non-active secondary progressive (nSPMS) multiple sclerosis. This study met its primary analysis endpoint  demonstrating a statistically significant reduction in cumulative change on EDSS with masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/day (p=0.0256).Approval of confirmatory Phase 3 study with masitinib in Alzheimer's diseaseAB Science announced in October 2022 that the first authorizations have been received to initiate its phase 3 confirmatory study (AB21004) evaluating masitinib in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's Disease (AD) from the French Medicine Agency (ANSM) together with AEMPS (Spain agency) and EOF (Greece agency).This study has also been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).Study AB21004 is a randomized  double-blind phase 3 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of masitinib in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease  as an add-on therapy to standard of care  cholinesterase inhibitors and/or memantine. The study will enroll 600 patients with confirmed clinical diagnosis of mild and moderate Alzheimer's disease  corresponding to an Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) score of less than 73 and a Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of between 14 to 25  inclusive.The objective of study AB21004 is to confirm treatment effect with masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/day as an adjunct to cholinesterase inhibitor and/or memantine in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease. The primary endpoint of the study will be to evaluate the effect of masitinib on absolute change from baseline in ADCS-ADL score and in ADAS-Cog-11.This confirmatory study follows a first positive Phase 2B/3 study (AB09004) which showed that masitinib can generate a significant treatment effect relative to placebo in the primary endpoint of change from baseline in ADAS-Cog  an instrument that measures the effect on cognition and memory.First complete bone marrow response in a n acute myeloid leukemia patient in its AB8939 Phase I/II clinical trialAB Science announced in March 2023 a case report from the initial stage of its Phase I/II study (AB18001) evaluating AB8939  a microtubule destabilizer  in patients with refractory and relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML).The AML patient in question was in failure to prior treatment with azacitidine and presented with a MECOM gene rearrangement  which is a biomarker for resistance to standard chemotherapies that is associated with a high-risk of disease progression and inferior prognosis.One month after the first treatment cycle (i.e.  three consecutive days of AB8939 treatment) there was a drastic reduction in bone marrow blast cells (i.e.  leukemia cells)  from a pretreatment level of 55% to 5% (i.e.  a morphologic leukemia free state). Remarkably  this response was achieved at a very low dose of AB8939  corresponding to the second step of dose increment (out of 13 potential steps) in phase I. The patient also showed excellent tolerance to AB8939  having experienced no treatment-related toxicities. At the request of the investigator  AB Science has authorized further treatment cycles of AB8939 to this patient. One month after the second treatment cycle of three consecutive days at this dose  a good response has been maintained with bone marrow blasts being at 10% (corresponding to a 5-fold reduction relative to baseline). A third treatment cycle for this patient has been initiated.Considering the overall study to date  there have been no signs of moderate  severe or serious toxicity and approximately 50% of patients have requested further treatment cycles of AB8939 after the first cycle of treatment and a measurement at day 28.CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION FOR THE YEAR 2022The operating result at 31 December 2022 was a loss of €15 937k  compared with a loss of €13 808k as of 31 December 2021  an increase in the operating loss of €2 129k (15.4%).Operating income  exclusively made up of revenues related to the operation of a drug in veterinary medicine  amounted to €958k as of 31 December 2022  compared to €1 607k a year earlier.Operating expenses amounted to €16 896k as of 31 December 2022  compared to €15 415k as of 31 December 2021  an increase of 9.6%.Marketing expenses were stable compared to 31 December 2021  rising from €493k at 31 December 2021 to €480k as of 31 December 2022.Administrative expenses decreased by 15% from €3 578k as of 31 December 2021 to €3 040k as of 31 December 2022.Research and development costs increased by €2 112k  or 18.8%  from €11 233k as of 31 December 2021 to €13 345k as of 31 December 2022.The gain of €2 326k at 31 December 2022 is mainly related to the recognition of the change in fair value between 31 December 2022 and 31 December 2021 of the preference shares resulting from the conversion of the bonds in December 2016 (class C)  i.e. a financial gain of €2 557k with no impact on cash for the period.The consolidated net loss at 31 December 2022 is €13 615k compared to a loss of €14 463k as of 31 December 2021  a decrease of 5.9%.The following table summarizes the consolidated financial statements for the year 2022 prepared in accordance with IFRS  and comparative information with the year 2021:In thousands of euros  except for share data 31/12/2022 31/12/2021 Net turnover 958 1 607 Cost of sales (31) (111) Marketing expenses (480) (493) Administrative expenses (3 040) (3 578) Research and development expenses (13 345) (11 233) Operating income (15 937) (13 808) Financial income 4 904 887 Financier expenses (2 578) (1 506) Financial income 2 326 (618) Net income (13 615) (14 463) Total comprehensive income for the period (13 356) (14 189) Basic earnings per share - in euros (0 29) (0 30) Diluted earnings per share - in euros (0 29) (0 30)In thousands of euros 31/12/2022 31/12/2021 Cash and cash equivalents 7 269 8 721 Total Assets 23 841 21 271 Equity (35 670) (23 198) Non-current liabilities 36 432 26 986 Trade payables 12 248 11 368 Current liabilities 23 079 17 482OTHER CORPORATE INFORMATION FOR YEAR 2022 AND SINCE DECEMBER 31  2022Capital increase for an amount of 15 million eurosAB Science announced on April 24  2023 the success of its capital increase through the issuance of new ordinary shares with attached warrants  with a waiver of preferential subscription rights.The Capital Increase consisted of a private placement pursuant to Articles L. 225-136 of the French Commercial Code and L. 411-2 1° of the French Monetary and Financial Code and has been carried out with a waiver of preferential subscription rights  pursuant to the delegation of authority granted to the Board of Directors under the 20th resolution of the Combined General Shareholders' Meeting of June 29  2022. The Capital Increase has taken the form of the issuance of 2 608 686 actions new ordinary shares (the ""New Shares"") to each of which are attached a share subscription warrant (the ""Warrants"").The Capital Increase was made through a cash contribution of approximately EUR 11.5 million and by offsetting existing receivables  i.e. approximately EUR 3.0 million (receivables related to the pre-financing of the research tax credit for the 2020 financial year and maturing in 2023  as well as approximately EUR 500 000 in interest accrued to date on the convertible bonds issued in February 2022).Two warrants giving the right to subscribe to one ordinary share  all of the 2 608 686 New Shares and all of the 1 304 343 new shares that would be issued upon exercise of the warrants  i.e. a total of 3 913 029 shares in the Company  represent 7.36% of the Company's current share capital.The issue price of the New Shares has been set at 5.75 euros (0.01 euro par value and 5.74 euros issue premium) and the exercise price of the Warrants at 8.625 euros  representing a total fundraising of approximately EUR 15.0 million (taking into account the exercise of the warrants  the maximum amount of the Capital Increase could be increased by an amount of 26.3 million euros).The Warrants may be exercised from January 1st  2025 to December 31  2030.Drawdown of the first two tranches for a total amount of €12 million under its financing agreement with the European Investment BankAB Science announced in December 2022 that it has received payment of €6.0 million as the first tranche of a €15 million loan from the European Investment Bank (EIB).AB Science announced in January 2023 that it has received payment of €6.0 million as the second tranche of the EIB loan.The agreement signed with the EIB provides a financing in two tranches of EUR 6.0 million and a third tranche of EUR 3.0 million  each subject to the fulfillment of certain conditions precedent  which have been satisfied for the first two tranches. Each tranche is accompanied by the issue of warrants  the number of which is calculated in relation to a reference price of 14 euros according to the following formula: Number of warrants = Amount of the tranche / (14 x m) with m = 3.4 for tranche 1 and 3.7 for tranche 2.The first tranche has a maturity of six years and is therefore repayable in December 2028. It carries a capitalized annual interest rate of 9.0% and the issuance of 126 050 warrants  each giving the right to subscribe to one ordinary share of AB Science at 8.61 euros for 15 years. These warrants represent 0.24% of the current capital of the Company (if they were to be exercised in their entirety).The second tranche  also of EUR 6.0 million  has a maturity of five years and is therefore repayable in January 2028. It carries a capitalized annual interest rate of 7.0% and the issuance of 115 830 warrants  each giving the right to subscribe to one ordinary share of AB Science at 14.0 euros for 15 years. These warrants represent 0.22% of the current capital of the Company (if they were to be exercised in their entirety).Renewal of the Programme d'Augmentation de Capital à Terme ( PACT ) concluded with Alpha Blue OceanAlpha Blue Ocean is committed to subscribe  from the date of publication of the 2022 annual report  to newly issued shares of AB Science (in tranches comprised of a number of shares between 500 000 and 1 million) over a period of 24 months  up to a maximum of 4.0 million shares in total (or 7.2% of the company's share capital on the basis of the capital after the capital increase announced on 24 April 2023). Such subscriptions for new shares shall be carried out using the 28th resolution of the Shareholder's Meeting of June 29  2022 (as renewed or otherwise amended  if applicable).By way of example  based on the April 27  2023 closing price of AB Science's shares  i.e 6.27 euros  on Euronext Paris  it is estimated that AB Science could raise approximately 25 million euros through this equity financing facility.For each tranche  the issuance price of new shares of AB Science  subscribed by Alpha Blue Ocean  shall be equal to 100% of the volume-weighted average price of the shares of AB Science traded on Euronext Paris over the three trading days preceding a tranche drawdown request.For each tranche  and after the settlement-delivery of the new shares of AB Science following the relevant capital increase  80% of the proceeds of the tranche shall be secured in an escrow account with a third-party escrow agent. The remaining balance shall be kept by AB Science.Following predefined trading rules for each tranche  Alpha Blue Ocean shall manage the orderly sale  on or off the market  of the AB Science shares subscribed to. 95% of the proceeds shall be distributed to AB Science on a monthly basis (minus a structuration fee)  directly from Alpha Blue Ocean or by way of a release from the escrow account.AB Science has no obligations to draw down on the PACT and shall utilise this innovative financing solution only if necessary and if the market conditions are favourable to the interests of AB Science and its shareholders.For each drawdown  the number of shares issued with respect to this agreement and admitted to trading will be reported in an Euronext notice and in a specific communication on AB Science's website.Investors are invited to take note of the risks associated with this transaction  potentially dilutive of 7.2% of the company's share capital on the basis of the capital after the capital increase announced on 24 April 2023  which could create downward pressure on the AB Science share  as mentioned in sections 6.4.4 and 6.4.6 of the 2022 annual report. Investors are also invited to be vigilant before taking the decision to invest in a company that carries out such operations  particularly when they are carried out successively. AB Science recalls that the present dilutive financing operation is not the first one it has put in place.Restructuring of convertible bonds issued in February 2022 and Class C preferred sharesAB Science announced on 21 April 2023 the negotiation of a framework agreement under which the terms and conditions of the bond issue agreement (entered into with the holders of the US$8.5 million convertible bonds issued in February 2022 and to which 50 000 warrants were attached with an exercise price of 000 warrants with an exercise price of EUR 12.65) would be amended to provide  on 15 July 2023 and automatically  for the conversion of all the convertible bonds into ordinary shares of AB Science on the basis of a price per share of EUR 5.75 (i.e. the subscription price of the New Shares).A framework agreement has also been negotiated with the holders of Class C preferred shares (the ""C Preferred""). The C Preferred still in circulation would be repurchased by AB Science for one symbolic euro (and subsequently cancelled). 520 786 share warrants (each warrant entitling the holder to subscribe for one ordinary share of AB Science at par value for a period of 12 months) will be issued in substitution of the C Preferred. In addition  still in substitution of the C Preferred  a new class of preferred shares would be created  benefiting from priority dividend rights (equal to 1.25% of the net sales of masitinib or of any licensing royalties  up to a limit of 9.0 million euros) and convertible into 750 000 ordinary shares of AB Science if the share price of AB Science exceeds a threshold of 30 euros for more than 90 consecutive days.These agreements will be submitted to AB Science shareholders for approval at the next annual general shareholders meeting  Alain Moussy having declared that he was in favour of the planned restructuring.Finally  it will be proposed to the shareholders to extend the term of certain lines of warrants already issued  to adapt to the evolution of AB Science's strategy and of its clinical pipeline.Decision of the Enforcement Committee of the French market regulator (AMF) following the investigation relating to the financial information and the market for AB Science shares  opened in September 20 17On March 24  2022  the AMF Enforcement Committee ruled that there was no privileged information  neither at the time of the two capital increases carried out by AB Science on March 24 and 27  2017  nor at the time Alain Moussy sold a part of his shares on March 31  2017. The AMF Enforcement Committee therefore completely exonerated Alain Moussy  prosecuted for insider trading  and found that AB Science had not failed to comply with its disclosure obligations at the time of these capital increases in March 2017.The AMF Enforcement Committee nevertheless considered that AB Science should have communicated as early as April 7  2017 the high probability of a negative opinion from the European Medicine Agency (EMA) on the marketing authorization application for masitinib for the treatment of mastocytosis and ordered AB Science to pay the sum of one million euros.In application of its internal procedures  AB Science had nevertheless put in place a deferral of privileged information from this date of April 7  2017  considering that the delay in communication was in the interest of the Company and in line with industry practices of not communicating before the final vote of the CHMP  or else withdrawing the registration dossier  which AB Science had no intention to do.Given this difference in assessment concerning a technical point relating to one of the criteria for the deferred communication of privileged information  as well as the amount of penalty  AB Science has decided to appeal to the Paris Court of Appeal. The President of AMF also appealed against the Enforcement Committee's decision. It concerns in particular the exoneration of Alain Moussy.Other eventsAutres opérations sur les valeurs mobilièresDuring the year 2022  the following were granted:183 040 share warrants  of which 50 000 were granted to a historical investor  126 050 to the European Investment Bank as part of the financing agreement and 6 990 to directors5 000 stock-options to an employeePEA-PME eligibilityAB Science confirms its eligibility for PEA-PME (a share savings plan aimed at providing finance to SMEs) in accordance with decree no. 2014-283 of 4 March 2014 taken for the application of article 70 of law no. 2013-1278 of 29 December 2013 of finance for 2014 fixing the eligibility of companies for PEA-PME  i.e. less than 5 000 employees on the one hand  an annual turnover of less than 1.5 billion euros or a balance sheet total of less than 2 billion euros  on the other hand.About AB ScienceFounded in 2001  AB Science is a pharmaceutical company specializing in the research  development and commercialization of protein kinase inhibitors (PKIs)  a class of targeted proteins whose action are key in signaling pathways within cells.
