It adds that the real figure is likely to be much higher once higher-priced tickets and corporate packages are taken into account  with revenue also likely to be boosted by merchandising sales and media rights.READ MOREDrummer Larry Mullen is not participating in the residency as he will be recovering from surgery.DAA judicial reviewAirport operator DAA is seeking a judicial review of Fingal’s new county development plan  reports the Sunday Independent.The operator of Dublin and Cork airports claims the plan could impose additional costs of more than €1.8 billion on the airport  impinging its future development.DAA has commenced action in the High Court claiming that two material alterations to the plan  relating to noise and the rezoning of strategic land  could impose a loss of value on the company as well as the State as its shareholder.A spokesman for the operator said the aircraft noise material alteration had been adopted by Fingal councillors against the recommendations of both Fingal’s chief executive and the Office of the Planning Regulator (OPR) and was “an arbitrary requirement to expand the noise insulation schemes”.Stamp duty lossThe exit of building materials group CRH and Paddy Power owner Flutter Entertainment from the Euronext Dublin Stock Exchange will cost the Government close to €250 million a year in lost stamp duty  according to the Sunday Times.Fears are rising over the future of Ireland’s equity markets after CRH  the largest stock on the index  said it would quit it in favour of a primary listing on the New York Stock Exchange. Flutter is expected to follow suit.Investors buying shares on Euronext Dublin pay a transaction tax of 1 per cent  compared with 0.5 per cent in London. The newspaper says it understands that executives from Euronext Dublin have asked the Government to introduce incentives to boost deal flows  including a possible reduction in the tax.RTÉ's TG4 concernsRTÉ told a consultancy process that it “assumed” that extra funding received by TG4 to launch its new children’s channel would not come at RTÉ's expense “in a scenario where there are competing demands for public funding for public service broadcasting”  reports the Sunday Independent.The broadcaster also highlighted how TG4 had received a number of tranches of extra funding in recent years while RTÉ was still short of the additional financial boost that had been previously recommended by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.It raised this in a submission to Communications Chambers  a consultancy firm analysing plans for the new €5.6 million a year Irish language children’s channel  Cúla4  and a time-shifted channel. The submission was released to the newspaper under the Freedom of Information Act.Accenture’s Meta contractMore than a quarter of the jobs being cut at Accenture’s Dublin office are the result of Meta cancelling a contract with the global consulting firm  reports the Business Post  citing an internal company document.In March  Accenture announced that it was cutting 400 of its staff in Ireland as part of a plan to lay off 19 000 of its more than 700 000 employees worldwide over the next 18 months.The newspaper said 113 of the 404 roles being made redundant relate to an account Accenture holds with Meta  but the company has told employees that “this work is no longer being undertaken by Accenture for the client” and that the project “will no longer be in operation” as of the end of April.Ires Reit meetingTwo heavyweight shareholders in Ires Reit  Ireland’s largest private landlord  have thrown their weight behind the board of the company in advance of a critical vote at the trust’s annual meeting next week  according to the Sunday Times.The newspaper understands that US-based Fidelity Investments and Dutch giant APG Asset Management  which account for a combined 12 per cent of the register  will vote with the board at the May 4th meeting.Vision Capital  which has about 5 per cent of Ires stock  has accused the trust’s board of mismanaging the company and wants to see the trust privatised.,positive,0.9,0.1,0.0,negative,0.0,0.09,0.91,True,English,"['Beautiful pay day beckons', 'Las Vegas residency', 'U2', 'Dutch giant APG Asset Management', 'Paddy Power owner Flutter Entertainment', 'UV Achtung Baby performances', 'aircraft noise material alteration', 'New York Stock Exchange', 'Euronext Dublin Stock Exchange', 'new county development plan', 'two material alterations', '17,500-capacity MSG Sphere', 'first live shows', 'Drummer Larry Mullen', 'Two heavyweight shareholders', 'US-based Fidelity Investments', 'noise insulation schemes', 'May 4th meeting', 'additional financial boost', 'global consulting firm', 'largest private landlord', 'Las Vegas residency', 'building materials group', 'public service broadcasting', 'Ires Reit meeting', 'internal company document', 'Stamp duty loss', 'DAA judicial review', 'largest stock', 'Ires stock', 'annual meeting', 'additional costs', 'future development', 'public funding', 'Broadcasting Authority', 'consultancy firm', 'new children', 'record pay-day', 'Business Post', 'concert series', 'presale phase', 'general sale', 'Venetian Hotel', 'residency format', 'lower costs', 'higher profits', 'four years', 'standard fee', '90 per cent', 'real figure', 'corporate packages', 'merchandising sales', 'media rights', 'Sunday Independent', 'Cork airports', 'High Court', 'strategic land', 'chief executive', 'Planning Regulator', 'arbitrary requirement', 'Sunday Times', 'equity markets', 'primary listing', '1 per cent', '0.5 per cent', 'deal flows', 'possible reduction', 'consultancy process', 'extra funding', 'competing demands', 'recent years', 'Communications Chambers', 'Irish language', 'Cúla', 'Information Act', 'a quarter', 'next 18 months', 'critical vote', '12 per cent', 'Vision Capital', 'Dublin office', 'face value', 'transaction tax', 'Fingal councillors', 'TG4 concerns', 'time-shifted channel', 'priced tickets', 'Airport operator', 'Meta contract', 'new €', '297,500 tickets', 'U2', 'place', '17 dates', 'autumn', 'band', 'concerts', 'newspaper', 'account', 'revenue', 'READ', 'surgery', 'rezoning', 'State', 'spokesman', 'recommendations', 'OPR', 'exit', 'CRH', 'Government', 'Fears', 'Ireland', 'index', 'favour', 'suit', 'Investors', 'shares', 'London', 'executives', 'incentives', 'RTÉ', 'expense', 'scenario', 'broadcaster', 'number', 'tranches', 'submission', 'plans', 'Freedom', 'Accenture', 'jobs', 'result', 'March', 'staff', 'part', '700,000 employees', '404 roles', 'work', 'client', 'project', 'operation', 'April', 'board', 'advance', 'trust', 'register', '6']",2023-04-30,2023-05-01,irishtimes.com

Below are certain material excerpts from the full 2022 Annual Report the entirety of which can be found on our website at www.thunderbirdresorts.com.LETTER FROM CEODear Shareholders and Investors:The below summarizes the Group's performance through December 31  2022.1. CHANGES IN PERFORMANCE IN 2022In summary  Group revenue from continuing operations increased by $1.4 million or 10.5%  while adjusted EBITDA decreased by $172 thousand or -4.5%. Consolidated Profit for the period is $927 thousand  an improvement of $638 thousand or 220.8% as compared with 2021 results.EBITDA1: Peru property EBITDA fell by $7 thousand and Nicaragua property EBITDA increased by $24 thousand  respectively  as compared to the same period in 2021. Corporate Expense was increased by $189 thousand in 2022 as compared to 2021. Adjusted EBITDA decreased by $172 thousand or -4.5% through December 31  2022 as compared to through December 31  2021. Profit / (Loss): Our Profit improved by approximately $638 thousand for the period as compared to 2021. This improvement was the result of increased revenue and other gains of $1.4 million and $792 thousand  respectively  partially offset by increased expenses of approximately $1.6 million in 2022 as compared to 2021. Net Debt: Net debt as of December 31  2022 decreased to $7.2 million as compared to $16.1 million as of December 31  2021. Due to a change in accounting policy as required by IFRS 16  the Group is required to account for the net present value of real estate operating lease contracts as Obligations under leases and hire purchase contracts. Approximately $4.1 million of our net debt is comprised of Obligations under leases and hire purchase contracts. MANAGEMENT TO MITIGATE THE RISKS OF COVID-19: In terms of demand  the tail effects of Covid-19 still could be felt in local demand for offices due to remote work and in consumer and tourism spending in the hotel business in particular. Having said that  through 2022  Management not only continued to stabilize its office and gaming operations and cash management  but retooled its business away from hotels with the conversion of its last remaining hotel to apartments (see below). As a result  we feel reasonably confident that the Group is able to carry on with the shareholder mandate set forth in the September 21  2016 Special Resolutions. See more about our progress below.Story continues2.

Peru Office Real Estate Performance Improving: The Group also has approximately 6 703 m2 of rentable-sellable office space  and 83 underground parking spaces. Office occupancies have stabilized over 2022  but at levels that are lower than those pre-covid.

Specifically  Directors have considered: (i) there are probably no sources of new financing available to the Group; (ii) the Group has limited trading exposures to our local suppliers and retail customers; (iii) other risks to which the Group is exposed  the most significant of which is considered to be regulatory risk; (iv) sources of Group income  including management fees charged to and income distributed from its various operations; (v) cash generation and debt amortization levels; (vi) fundamental trends of the Group's businesses; (vii) ability to re-amortize and unsecured lenders; and (vii) level of interest of third parties in the acquisition of certain operating assets  and status of genuine progress and probability of closing within the Going Concern period. The Directors have also considered certain critical factors that might affect continuing operations  as follows:Special Resolution: On September 21  2016  the Group's shareholders approved a special resolution that  among other items  authorized the Board of Directors of the Corporate to sell ""any or all remaining assets of the Corporation in such amounts and at such times as determined by the Board of Directors."" This resolution facilitates the sale of any one or any combination of assets required to support maintaining of a going concern by the Group.Corporate Expense and Cash Flow: Corporate expense has decreased materially in recent years  but still must accommodate for compliance as a public company.Liquidity and Working Capital: As of the date of publication of this 2022 Annual Report  the Group forecasts to operate with higher levels of reserves and working capital than in recent years  but to create a healthy level of working capital reserves for periods beyond the Going Concern period may require the sale of additional assets.In part  the Group believes that it is in a stronger position to sustain going concern as of the publication date of this 2022 Annual Report as compared to recent years during the covid crisis because of the following:Peru Real Estate Sales: As of the date of publication of this 2022 Annual Report  the Group has converted it's 66-suite hotel in Lima  Peru into a 66-unit condominium apartment complex. The Group has: i) Legally sub-divided the former hotel in to 66 individually titled apartment units  procured all change of use and other regulatory approvals  and sold the majority of those units; and ii) Paid off over $4.5 million of senior debt in Lima  Peru. The projection is to generate in excess of $10 million from all unit sales  which will likely be completed during 2023.Other liquidity events: The Group continues to work with unsecured lenders and  in some cases  to negotiate payment plans and balances that meet the Group's cash flow. If the Group is not able to create other liquidity events from its remaining Peru  Costa Rica and Nicaragua assets in 2023-2024  it is reasonable to expect that some unsecured lenders may pursue years of litigation at that time  though as to whether this would then have an impact on Going Concern is hard to assess.Considering the above  Management and Directors are satisfied that the consolidated Group has adequate resources to mitigate the uncertainty and that the Group is able to continue as a going concern for at least the 12 months following the filing date of this report. For these reasons  Management and Directors have therefore prepared the consolidated financial statements on a going concern basis.THUNDERBIRD RESORTS  INC.
