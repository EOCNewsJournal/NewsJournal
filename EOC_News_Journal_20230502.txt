CHANGES IN PERFORMANCE IN 2022In summary  Group revenue from continuing operations increased by $1.4 million or 10.5%  while adjusted EBITDA decreased by $172 thousand or -4.5%. Consolidated Profit for the period is $927 thousand  an improvement of $638 thousand or 220.8% as compared with 2021 results.EBITDA1: Peru property EBITDA fell by $7 thousand and Nicaragua property EBITDA increased by $24 thousand  respectively  as compared to the same period in 2021. Corporate Expense was increased by $189 thousand in 2022 as compared to 2021. Adjusted EBITDA decreased by $172 thousand or -4.5% through December 31  2022 as compared to through December 31  2021. Profit / (Loss): Our Profit improved by approximately $638 thousand for the period as compared to 2021. This improvement was the result of increased revenue and other gains of $1.4 million and $792 thousand  respectively  partially offset by increased expenses of approximately $1.6 million in 2022 as compared to 2021. Net Debt: Net debt as of December 31  2022 decreased to $7.2 million as compared to $16.1 million as of December 31  2021. Due to a change in accounting policy as required by IFRS 16  the Group is required to account for the net present value of real estate operating lease contracts as Obligations under leases and hire purchase contracts. Approximately $4.1 million of our net debt is comprised of Obligations under leases and hire purchase contracts. MANAGEMENT TO MITIGATE THE RISKS OF COVID-19: In terms of demand  the tail effects of Covid-19 still could be felt in local demand for offices due to remote work and in consumer and tourism spending in the hotel business in particular. Having said that  through 2022  Management not only continued to stabilize its office and gaming operations and cash management  but retooled its business away from hotels with the conversion of its last remaining hotel to apartments (see below). As a result  we feel reasonably confident that the Group is able to carry on with the shareholder mandate set forth in the September 21  2016 Special Resolutions. See more about our progress below.Story continues2. MATERIAL PROGRESS TOWARD SHAREHOLDER MANDATEThe Group continues to pursue decisions that will support the best interest of shareholders according to the shareholder mandate set forth in the September 21  2016 Special Resolutions the status of which is summarized below in relation to the Group's key remaining assets:Peru Hotel Real Estate Converted to Apartment Units: As of the date of publication of this 2022 Annual Report  the Group has converted its 66-suite hotel in Lima  Peru into a 66-unit condominium apartment complex. The Group has: i) Legally sub-divided the former hotel into 66 individually titled apartment units  procured all change of use and other regulatory approvals  and sold the majority of those units; and ii) Paid off over $4.5 million of senior debt in Lima  Peru. The projection is to generate in excess of $10 million from all unit sales  which will likely be completed during 2023. Peru Office Real Estate Performance Improving: The Group also has approximately 6 703 m2 of rentable-sellable office space  and 83 underground parking spaces. Office occupancies have stabilized over 2022  but at levels that are lower than those pre-covid. The Group is evaluating whether or not to convert offices to apartment units and to sell them individually as it has been executing successfully on for the hotel-to-apartment conversion. Nicaragua Gaming and Real Estate Assets: As of the publication date of this 2022 Annual Report  the Group continued to own a 56% interest in a Nicaraguan holding company that owns the following assets: i) Gaming: Three full casinos and three slot parlors with a combined approximately 630 gaming positions; and ii) Real Estate: Approximately 4 562 m2 of land divided among 5 parcels as more fully detailed on page 14. Costa Rica Real Estate Asset: As of the publication of this 2022 Annual Report  the Group continues to own a 50% interest in a Costa Rican entity that owns the 11.6-hectare real estate property known as ""Tres Rios"". Tres Rios  with its own  dedicated off ramp  is located close to the country's 2nd largest mall on the highway between the capital city of San Jose and the commuter city of Cartago.The Group will continue to pursue decisions that will support the best interest of shareholders according to the shareholder mandate set forth in the September 21  2016 Special Resolutions.Salomon GuggenheimChief Executive Officer and PresidentApril 30  20231.

In summary  Group revenue increased by $1.4 million or 10.5%  while adjusted EBITDA decreased by $172 thousand or -4.5%. Consolidated Profit for the period is $927 thousand  an improvement of $638 thousand or 220.8% as compared with 2021 results.RISK MANAGEMENTFor more detail on Risk Factors  see Chapter 8 of the Annual Report.MANAGEMENT STATEMENT ON ""GOING CONCERN""Management has reviewed their plan with the Directors and has collectively formed a judgment about the going concern of the Group. In arriving at this judgment  Management has prepared the cash flow projections of the Group. The Group has suffered recurring losses the past years. In response to the recurring losses of the previous years  Management has taken actions which will be described in the following paragraphs.Directors have reviewed this information provided by Management and have considered the information in relation to the financing uncertainties in the current economic climate  the Group's existing commitments and the financial resources available to the Group. Specifically  Directors have considered: (i) there are probably no sources of new financing available to the Group; (ii) the Group has limited trading exposures to our local suppliers and retail customers; (iii) other risks to which the Group is exposed  the most significant of which is considered to be regulatory risk; (iv) sources of Group income  including management fees charged to and income distributed from its various operations; (v) cash generation and debt amortization levels; (vi) fundamental trends of the Group's businesses; (vii) ability to re-amortize and unsecured lenders; and (vii) level of interest of third parties in the acquisition of certain operating assets  and status of genuine progress and probability of closing within the Going Concern period. The Directors have also considered certain critical factors that might affect continuing operations  as follows:Special Resolution: On September 21  2016  the Group's shareholders approved a special resolution that  among other items  authorized the Board of Directors of the Corporate to sell ""any or all remaining assets of the Corporation in such amounts and at such times as determined by the Board of Directors."" This resolution facilitates the sale of any one or any combination of assets required to support maintaining of a going concern by the Group.Corporate Expense and Cash Flow: Corporate expense has decreased materially in recent years  but still must accommodate for compliance as a public company.Liquidity and Working Capital: As of the date of publication of this 2022 Annual Report  the Group forecasts to operate with higher levels of reserves and working capital than in recent years  but to create a healthy level of working capital reserves for periods beyond the Going Concern period may require the sale of additional assets.In part  the Group believes that it is in a stronger position to sustain going concern as of the publication date of this 2022 Annual Report as compared to recent years during the covid crisis because of the following:Peru Real Estate Sales: As of the date of publication of this 2022 Annual Report  the Group has converted it's 66-suite hotel in Lima  Peru into a 66-unit condominium apartment complex. The Group has: i) Legally sub-divided the former hotel in to 66 individually titled apartment units  procured all change of use and other regulatory approvals  and sold the majority of those units; and ii) Paid off over $4.5 million of senior debt in Lima  Peru. The projection is to generate in excess of $10 million from all unit sales  which will likely be completed during 2023.Other liquidity events: The Group continues to work with unsecured lenders and  in some cases  to negotiate payment plans and balances that meet the Group's cash flow. If the Group is not able to create other liquidity events from its remaining Peru  Costa Rica and Nicaragua assets in 2023-2024  it is reasonable to expect that some unsecured lenders may pursue years of litigation at that time  though as to whether this would then have an impact on Going Concern is hard to assess.Considering the above  Management and Directors are satisfied that the consolidated Group has adequate resources to mitigate the uncertainty and that the Group is able to continue as a going concern for at least the 12 months following the filing date of this report. For these reasons  Management and Directors have therefore prepared the consolidated financial statements on a going concern basis.THUNDERBIRD RESORTS  INC.

CHANGES IN PERFORMANCE IN 2022In summary  Group revenue from continuing operations increased by $1.4 million or 10.5%  while adjusted EBITDA decreased by $172 thousand or -4.5%. Consolidated Profit for the period is $927 thousand  an improvement of $638 thousand or 220.8% as compared with 2021 results.EBITDA 1 : Peru property EBITDA fell by $7 thousand and Nicaragua property EBITDA increased by $24 thousand  respectively  as compared to the same period in 2021.

Profit / (Loss) : Our Profit improved by approximately $638 thousand for the period as compared to 2021. This improvement was the result of increased revenue and other gains of $1.4 million and $792 thousand  respectively  partially offset by increased expenses of approximately $1.6 million in 2022 as compared to 2021. Net Debt : Net debt as of December 31  2022 decreased to $7.2 million as compared to $16.1 million as of December 31  2021.

Approximately $4.1 million of our net debt is comprised of Obligations under leases and hire purchase contracts.2. MANAGEMENT TO MITIGATE THE RISKS OF COVID-19In terms of demand  the tail effects of Covid-19 still could be felt in local demand for offices due to remote work and in consumer and tourism spending in the hotel business in particular. Having said that  through 2022  Management not only continued to stabilize its office and gaming operations and cash management  but retooled its business away from hotels with the conversion of its last remaining hotel to apartments (see below). As a result  we feel reasonably confident that the Group is able to carry on with the shareholder mandate set forth in the September 21  2016 Special Resolutions. See more about our progress below.3.

LETTER FROM CEO Dear Shareholders and Investors: The below summarizes the Group's performance through December 31  2022. 1. CHANGES IN PERFORMANCE IN 2022 In summary  Group revenue from continuing operations increased by $1.4 million or 10.5%  while adjusted EBITDA decreased by $172 thousand or -4.5%. Consolidated Profit for the period is $927 thousand  an improvement of $638 thousand or 220.8% as compared with 2021 results. EBITDA 1 : Peru property EBITDA fell by $7 thousand and Nicaragua property EBITDA increased by $24 thousand  respectively  as compared to the same period in 2021. Corporate Expense was increased by $189 thousand in 2022 as compared to 2021. Adjusted EBITDA decreased by $172 thousand or -4.5% through December 31  2022 as compared to through December 31  2021. Profit / (Loss) : Our Profit improved by approximately $638 thousand for the period as compared to 2021. This improvement was the result of increased revenue and other gains of $1.4 million and $792 thousand  respectively  partially offset by increased expenses of approximately $1.6 million in 2022 as compared to 2021. Net Debt : Net debt as of December 31  2022 decreased to $7.2 million as compared to $16.1 million as of December 31  2021. Due to a change in accounting policy as required by IFRS 16  the Group is required to account for the net present value of real estate operating lease contracts as Obligations under leases and hire purchase contracts. Approximately $4.1 million of our net debt is comprised of Obligations under leases and hire purchase contracts. 1 Th u n d e r bi r d B ui l di ng   C al l e A l be rt o Na v a rr o  A p t . 0 8 2 3 - 0 0 5 1 4   P a na ma   R e p u bl i c of P a n a ma Tel e p h o ne : (5 0 7 ) 2 2 3 - 1 2 3 4 e - ma i l : info@thunderbirdresorts.comwebsite: www.thunderbirdresorts.com 2. MANAGEMENT TO MITIGATE THE RISKS OF COVID-19 In terms of demand  the tail effects of Covid-19 still could be felt in local demand for offices due to remote work and in consumer and tourism spending in the hotel business in particular. Having said that  through 2022  Management not only continued to stabilize its office and gaming operations and cash management  but retooled its business away from hotels with the conversion of its last remaining hotel to apartments (see below). As a result  we feel reasonably confident that the Group is able to carry on with the shareholder mandate set forth in the September 21  2016 Special Resolutions. See more about our progress below. 3. MATERIAL PROGRESS TOWARD SHAREHOLDER MANDATE The Group continues to pursue decisions that will support the best interest of shareholders according to the shareholder mandate set forth in the September 21  2016 Special Resolutions the status of which is summarized below in relation to the Group's key remaining assets: Peru Hotel Real Estate Converted to Apartment Units : As of the date of publication of this 2022 AnnualReport  the Group has converted it's 66-suite hotel in Lima  Peru into a 66-unit condominium apartment complex. The Group has: i) Legally sub-divided the former hotel in to 66 individually titled apartment units  procured all change of use and other regulatory approvals  and sold the majority of those units; and ii) Paid off over $4.5 million of senior debt in Lima  Peru. The projection is to generate in excess of $10 million from all unit sales  which will likely be completed during 2023. Peru Office Real Estate Performance Improving The Group also has approximately 6 703 m2 of rentable- sellable office space  and 83 underground parking spaces. Office occupancies have stabilized over 2022  but at levels that are lower than those pre-covid. The Group is evaluating whether or not to convert offices to apartment units and to sell them individually as it has been executing successfully on for the hotel-to- apartment conversion. Nicaragua Gaming and Real Estate Assets : As of the publication date of this 2022 Annual Report  theGroup continued to own a 56% interest in a Nicaraguan holding company that owns the following assets: i)Gaming : Three full casinos and three slot parlors with a combined approximately 630 gaming positions; andii) Real Estate : Approximately 4 562 m2 of land divided among 5 parcels as more fully detailed on page 14.

RISK MANAGEMENT For more detail on Risk Factors  see Chapter 8 of the Annual Report. MANAGEMENT STATEMENT ON ""GOING CONCERN"" Management has reviewed their plan with the Directors and has collectively formed a judgment about the going concern of the Group. In arriving at this judgment  Management has prepared the cash flow projections of the Group. The Group has suffered recurring losses the past years. In response to the recurring losses of the previous years  Management has taken actions which will be described in the following paragraphs. Directors have reviewed this information provided by Management and have considered the information in relation to the financing uncertainties in the current economic climate  the Group's existing commitments and the financial resources available to the Group. Specifically  Directors have considered: (i) there are probably no sources of new financing available to the Group; (ii) the Group has limited trading exposures to our local suppliers and retail customers; (iii) other risks to which the Group is exposed  the most significant of which is considered to be regulatory risk; (iv) sources of Group income  including management fees charged to and income distributed from its various operations; (v) cash generation and debt amortization levels; (vi) fundamental trends of the Group's businesses; (vii) ability to re-amortize and unsecured lenders; and (vii) level of interest of third parties in the acquisition of certain operating assets  and status of genuine progress and probability of closing within the Going Concern period. The Directors have also considered certain critical factors that might affect continuing operations  as follows: Special Resolution : On September 21  2016  the Group's shareholders approved a special resolution that  among other items  authorized the Board of Directors of the Corporate to sell ""any or all remaining assets of the Corporation in such amounts and at such times as determined by the Board of Directors."" This resolution facilitates the sale of any one or any combination of assets required to support maintaining of a going concern by the Group.: On September 21  2016  the Group's shareholders approved a special resolution that  among other items  authorized the Board of Directors of the Corporate to sell ""any or all remaining assets of the Corporation in such amounts and at such times as determined by the Board of Directors."" This resolution facilitates the sale of any one or any combination of assets required to support maintaining of a going concern by the Group. Corporate Expense and Cash Flow : Corporate expense has decreased materially in recent years  but still must accommodate for compliance as a public company.: Corporate expense has decreased materially in recent years  but still must accommodate for compliance as a public company. Liquidity and Working Capital : As of the date of publication of this 2022 Annual Report  the Group forecasts to operate with higher levels of reserves and working capital than in recent years  but to create a healthy level of working capital reserves for periods beyond the Going Concern period may require the sale of additional assets. In part  the Group believes that it is in a stronger position to sustain going concern as of the publication date of this 2022 Annual Report as compared to recent years during the covid crisis because of the following: Peru Real Estate Sales : As of the date of publication of this 2022 Annual Report  the Group has converted it's66-suite hotel in Lima  Peru into a 66-unit condominium apartment complex. The Group has: i) Legally sub- divided the former hotel in to 66 individually titled apartment units  procured all change of use and other 3 Th u n d e r bi r d B ui l di ng   C al l e A l be rt o Na v a rr o  A p t . 0 8 2 3 - 0 0 5 1 4   P a na ma   R e p u bl i c of P a n a ma Tel e p h o ne : ( 5 0 7 ) 2 2 3 - 1 2 3 4 e - ma i l : info@thunderbirdresorts.comwebsite: www.thunderbirdresorts.com regulatory approvals  and sold the majority of those units; and ii) Paid off over $4.5 million of senior debt in Lima  Peru. The projection is to generate in excess of $10 million from all unit sales  which will likely be completed during 2023. Other liquidity events : The Group continues to work with unsecured lenders and  in some cases  to negotiate payment plans and balances that meet the Group's cash flow. If the Group is not able to create other liquidity events from its remaining Peru  Costa Rica and Nicaragua assets in 2023-2024  it is reasonable to expect that some unsecured lenders may pursue years of litigation at that time  though as to whether this would then have an impact on Going Concern is hard to assess. Considering the above  Management and Directors are satisfied that the consolidated Group has adequate resources to mitigate the uncertainty and that the Group is able to continue as a going concern for at least the 12 months following the filing date of this report. For these reasons  Management and Directors have therefore prepared the consolidated financial statements on a going concern basis. THUNDERBIRD RESORTS  INC.

This further acceleration in RevPAR (up 19% compared with first-quarter 2019) notably reflects the rebound of hotels in Asia following the liftin…,ACTIVITY CONTINUES TO ACCELERATE WITH REVPAR UP 57% VS. Q1 20222023 GROUP REVPAR OUTLOOK REVISED UPWARDS WITH DOUBLE-DIGIT GROWTH VS 2022In first-quarter 2023  Accor once again stepped-up business growth across all regions and in its two divisions: Premium  Midscale and Economy; and Luxury & Lifestyle. These excellent performances were driven in particular by the strong rebound in Asia  good price levels  and increased occupancy rates. They reflect the attractiveness of our brands  the commitment of our teams  and an ever-greater desire for travel and adventure on the part of our guests.Given this highly positive start of the year  we have revised our 2023 guidance upwards  with double-digit RevPAR growth versus 2022. Sébastien Bazin  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of AccorThe first quarter of 2023 demonstrated once again the robustness of the business recovery  quarter after quarter. This further acceleration in RevPAR (up 19% compared with first-quarter 2019) notably reflects the rebound of hotels in Asia following the lifting of the strict zero-COVID policy in China in late 2022. All the other regions also contributed to maintaining business activity at a substantially higher level than before the crisis.The underlying dynamics observed in previous quarters remained in place  with average prices still high and sequentially improving occupancy rate but slightly lower than in 2019.In first-quarter 2023  Accor opened 36 hotels  for around 4 400 rooms  and has thus achieved net network growth of 2.9% in the last 12 months. At end-March 2023  the Group had a hotel portfolio of 800 321 rooms (5 444 hotels) and a pipeline of around 214 000 rooms (1 241 hotels).Consolidated revenueThe Group reported first-quarter 2023 revenue of €1 139 million  up 54% like-for-like (LFL) versus Q1 2022. By activity  this growth breaks down into a 71% increase for Management & Franchise (M&F)  a 60% increase for Services to Owners  and a 37% increase for Hotel Assets and Other.By division (excluding Holding & Intercos)  €681 million of revenue was generated by the Premium  Midscale and Economy division  up 62% LFL compared with first-quarter 2022  and €477 million by Luxury & Lifestyle  up 52% LFL.Scope effects (acquisitions and disposals) made a positive €59 million contribution  owing primarily to the takeover of Paris Society.Currency effects had a negative impact of €2 million  stemming mainly from the Egyptian Pound (+79%) and the Turkish Lira (+30%) offsetting the US Dollar ((5)%).Source: AccorManagement & Franchise (M&F) revenueThe Management & Franchise business activity  i.e.  fees collected on the basis of Management and Franchise contracts  generated revenue of €268 million  up 71% LFL compared with first-quarter 2022. The revenue of M&F grew faster than its RevPAR (up 57% from first-quarter 2022) owing to the sharp increase in the incentive fees of hotels under management contracts.Source: AccorIn first-quarter 2023  Consolidated RevPAR continued its sequential rise  up 57% compared with first-quarter 2022 (and up 19% vs. first-quarter 2019).The Premium  Midscale and Economy division grew its RevPAR by 60% relative to first-quarter 2022  fueled by occupancy recovery on top of continued strong pricing power.Europe North Africa (ENA) region reported a 54% increase in RevPAR compared with first-quarter 2022. RevPAR remained solid in France   which accounts for 46% of room revenue of the region  bolstered in particular by the return of international guests to Paris. The strikes  notably in March  did not have a significant impact. The UK   13% of room revenue of the region achieved remarkable RevPAR growth  also thanks to the recovery of tourism in the capital. RevPAR in Germany   13% of room revenue of the region  has remained deteriorated since November 2022  reflecting the seasonal nature of trade fairs and congresses. But the improvement relative to first-quarter 2022 is significant  as the country lifted its health restrictions only in April 2022.(ENA) region reported a 54% increase in RevPAR compared with first-quarter 2022. The Middle East Asia-Pacific region reported a 69% increase in RevPAR compared with first-quarter 2022  taking advantage of the considerable rebound in activity in Asia. Business activity held up well overall in the Middle East   accounting for 27% of room revenue of the region. The robust recovery in religious pilgrimages to holy cities in Saudi Arabia offset the sequential slowdown relating to the Soccer World Cup in Qatar. Business activity in the Pacific  accounting for 28% of room revenue of the region was comparable with the last three quarters  with powerful momentum in leisure destinations driven by prices. South-East Asia   accounting for 27% of room revenue of the region benefited from the return of international travelers  notably to Thailand and Indonesia. Business has recovered particularly strongly in China since the Chinese New Year at the end of January  accounting for 18% of room revenue of the region. Considerable improvement potential remains for returning to the business levels of 2019.region reported a 69% increase in RevPAR compared with first-quarter 2022  taking advantage of the considerable rebound in activity in Asia. The Americas region  which mainly reflects the performances of Brazil (64% of room revenue of the region) for the Premium  Midscale and Economy division  maintained solid business activity levels  with RevPAR up 49% from first-quarter 2022. With the region having returned to 2019 levels in early 2022  the base effect is less favorable.The Luxury & Lifestyle division posted a 50% increase in RevPAR relative to first-quarter 2022. While price was the driving force for the recovery in 2022  occupancy increase is now pulling up the performance. As the recovery was swifter for this division than the rest of the portfolio  RevPAR growth is impacted by a less favorable base effect.Luxury   accounting for 78% of room revenue of the division  saw its RevPAR grow by 55% compared with first-quarter 2022. The increase was driven primarily by a year-on-year increase in the occupancy rate  but improvement potential remains in this respect as the occupancy rate remains 6 percentage points lower than in 2019.  accounting for 78% of room revenue of the division  saw its RevPAR grow by 55% compared with first-quarter 2022. The increase was driven primarily by a year-on-year increase in the occupancy rate  but improvement potential remains in this respect as the occupancy rate remains 6 percentage points lower than in 2019. Lifestyle RevPAR increased by 33% compared with first-quarter 2022. The weaker performance of the Lifestyle segment solely reflects a less favorable base effect as it was the segment to stage the most substantial recovery at the end of the crisis.Services to Owners revenueThe revenue of Services to Owners  which includes the Sales  Marketing  Distribution and Loyalty activities  as well as shared services and the repayment of hotel payroll costs  came out at €578 million in first-quarter 2023  up 60% LFL year on year. This increase was consistent with the activity level reflected in RevPAR growth.Hotel Assets & Other revenueHotel Assets & Other revenue totaled €311 million  for a 37% LFL increase on first-quarter 2022. Strongly linked to business in Australia  this segment had benefited from the more rapid recovery of activities linked to leisure tourism demand on the country's north-east coast  home to most of the Group's Strata activities (for example  room and apartment distribution and property management). As such  the base effect was less favorable for this business segment.As reported  the 56% increase in revenue reflects the consolidation of Paris Society business (premium restaurants and events management) since the end of 2022.At end-March 2023  this segment  which includes owned and leased hotels  comprised 113 hotels and 22 349 rooms.OutlookBased on first-quarter activity and bookings for the coming months  the Group now expects double-digit RevPAR growth for 2023 vs 2022  up from its previous +5% to +9% guidance.As part of its reorganization  Accor will organize a Capital Market Day on June 27th to provide more details on the strategy of each of its two new divisions and the expected outlook.Events from January 1st  2023 to April 27th  2023Appointment of Omer AcarOn January 3rd  2023  Accor announced the appointment of Omer Acar as CEO Raffles & Orient Express  effective from March 1st  2023.Appointment of Kamal RhazaliOn January 3rd  2023  Accor announced the appointment of Kamal Rhazali as Secretary General and General Counsel of its Luxury & Lifestyle division  effective from February 1st  2023Disposal of the remaining stake in H World Group Limited (Huazhu)On January 18th  2023  Accor announced that it had completed the disposal of the remaining stake in H World Group Limited (previously Huazhu Group Limited) for USD460m.

Quadient (Euronext Paris: QDT) ,QUADIENTBHCC locker stationMolly Hansen  senior special programs coordinator for Bunker Hill Community College  demonstrates using a Parcel Pending by Quadient parcel locker.Quadient (Euronext Paris: QDT)  a leader in helping businesses create meaningful customer connections through digital and physical channels and a major global parcel locker operator  announced today that Bunker Hill Community College (BHCC)  a public community college in Boston  Massachusetts serving a diverse student population of over 16 000  has selected Parcel Pending by Quadient refrigerated lockers to expand its successful DISH Food Pantry program that assists students struggling with food insecurity.With two main campuses in Charlestown and Chelsea  three satellite campuses and several instructional centers throughout the Greater Boston Area  BHCC is the largest community college in Massachusetts. More than half of BHCC’s student population struggles with food insecurity  which prompted the college to launch the food pantry program. BHCC wanted to provide a flexible  private way for students who need food assistance to access their food pantry orders. To meet this need  the school researched various parcel locker solutions from around the world and ultimately selected Quadient. Three Quadient locker stations were installed on the Charlestown campus in April 2022  and last week the program expanded with a new locker station on the Chelsea campus.“Our students are incredibly busy. They work demanding jobs and  many times  are only available after business hours or on the weekend ” said Molly Hansen  senior special programs coordinator for Bunker Hill Community College. “We wanted to come up with a way for students to access their food pantry orders within a time schedule that worked for them and for the staff at Bunker Hill.”Within three months after partnering with Quadient  BHCC installed the three smart locker towers at Charlestown. Two refrigerated towers provide storage for perishable items like fresh produce and frozen items  while the remaining tower on that campus is available for items such as dry food and hygiene products. The lockers serve 50-60 students per week and provide convenient access to essential items while reducing the anxiety around food insecurity. When their orders are ready for pick-up  students receive a text notification and can retrieve them discreetly and at the best time according to their schedules.Story continues“The feedback that we’ve received on both the lockers and the inventory has been incredibly positive.
