INFORMATION POLICY  INSIDER POLICY AND LOGBOOK INSTRUCTIONS The company has adopted an information policy in order to comply with the information requirements for a company whose shares are listed on a regulated market. The company has prepared a policy document in order to inform employees and other stakeholders within Troax about the applicable rules and regulations relating to the company's disclosure of information and the special requirements that apply for persons active in a listed company  for example with regard to information that affects the share price. INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING The objective of the internal financial controls within Troax is to create an effective decision-making process in which requirements  targets and frameworks are clearly defined. The company and the management use the internal control systems to monitor operations and the group's financial position. CONTROL ENVIRONMENT The basis for internal controls relating to financial reporting comprises the overall control environment. Troax's control environment includes sound values  competence  management philosophy  organisational structure  responsibility and authorities. Troax's internal instructions  policies  guidelines and manuals provide guidance for employees. RISK ASSESSMENT AND CONTROL ACTIVITIES There is a risk that material misstatement could occur in the financial statements in connection with accounting and measurement of assets  liabilities  income and expenses or deviations from information requirements. Each year  Troax's finance function carries out a risk analysis with regard to the group's balance sheet and income statement based on qualitative and quantitative risks. Standard control activities include account reconcil iation and supporting controls. The purpose of all control activities is to prevent  detect and correct any errors or discrepancies in the financial reporting. The most significant risks concerning financial reporting identified as a result of the Group's internal control activities are managed through control structures that in all material respects are based on deviation reporting from established goals or standards. FOLLOW-UP The Group applies IFRS. Financial data are reported on a monthly basis from 31 reporting entities in accordance with standardised reporting procedures. The reporting constitutes the basis for the Group's consolidated financial reporting. Consolidation is done from a legal and operational perspective  resulting in quarterly legal reports and monthly operational reports. INTERNAL AUDIT According to the Code  the Board must make a decision annually on whether the Company should have an internal audit function that evaluates whether internal governance and controls are functioning as planned  or whether the Board should establish that this is the case in some other way. At group level  the CEO of each legal entity  together with the legal and/or operating entity's finance function and the Group's finance director  are responsible for ensuring that requisite controls are carried out and followed up. Internal control includes control over the company's and Group's organisation  procedures and follow-up measures. The purpose is to ensure that reliable and accurate financial reporting takes place  that the company's and group's financial reporting is prepared in accordance with the law and applicable accounting standards  and that other requirements are fulfilled. The system for internal control also aims to monitor AUDITOR'S STATEMENT ON THE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT The control environment also includes laws and external regulations. Troax maintains a clear division of roles and responsibilities in order to ensure effective management of the company's risks  for example  through rules of procedure for the Board and committees and through the instruction for the CEO. In the continuing operations  the CEO is responsible for the system of internal controls that is required to create a control environment for material risks. Troax also has guidelines and policies on financial governance and follow-up  issues concerning communication and business ethics. The Board has appointed an Audit Committee  the duties of which include ensuring that established principles for financial reporting and internal controls are upheld. adherence to the company's and Group's policies  principles and instructions. In addition  the protection of the company's assets is monitored in an appropriate manner. Furthermore  internal control is performed through follow-up of implemented information and business systems and through risk analysis. The size of the company  combined with the work on internal governance and control described above  means that the Board has not found it necessary to set up a separate internal audit function  which is performed by the Board as a whole. Effective Board work is thus the basis for good internal control  and Troax's Board has established rules of procedure and clear instructions for its work. However  the issue of a dedicated internal audit function will be reviewed annually.

In Q1  Telko and Leipurin improved their financial performance compared to last year  and ESL Shipping continued to show strong profitability in a more challenging business environment. The exits of Kauko and Vulganus in 2022  and cost reductions on the Group level contributed positively to our financial performance.Our net sales from continuing operations in the first quarter 2023 increased by 10% to EUR 141.6 (128.8) million. Telko and Leipurin showed solid growth  whereas ESL Shipping’s net sales somewhat decreased. Comparable operating profit from continuing operations amounted to EUR 8.4 (8.7) million. Capacity constraints of time-chartered vessels  a decline in financial performance of the Supramax vessels in addition to strikes and overtime bans weakened ESL Shipping’s profitability. Leipurin saw very positive development in both net sales growth and profitability driven by the Kobia acquisition  inflation and performance improvement measures. Telko’s profitability was slightly up year-on-year and net sales increased by approximately 7% driven by both organic as well as non-organic growth. Telko’s acquisition of Eltrex in late January displayed further evidence of the company’s compounder strategy.During the quarter  Leipurin freed up capital by completing a sale and leaseback of the property in Gothenburg  Sweden and signing a similar transaction for its property in Hässleholm  Sweden. Leipurin is still in the process of exiting Russia  Kazakhstan  and Belarus. We aim to complete this transaction by the summer 2023.In April  after receiving the required approvals from the local authorities  Telko completed the sale of its Russian operations to a local industrial operator GK Himik. The sale was an important milestone  and it frees up time and resources within the organization to focus on growth opportunities in Western markets. Telko Belarus is being closed down.In late April  we announced that we are initiating a program to accelerate ESL Shipping’s low-carbon growth strategy. The aim is to assess a selection of alternative measures  including the launch of a new investment pool of green vessels  a possible equity injection in ESL Shipping by a minority shareholder  and the sale of the shipping company’s two Supramax vessels. Based on the program  preferred measures will be launched to enhance ESL Shipping’s capacity to execute its ESG-driven strategy. In all scenarios Aspo will remain a committed majority owner of ESL Shipping.All of Aspo’s businesses are in a good position to execute their strategies and perform well financially.ASPO GROUPFinancial results and targetsAspo's long-term financial targets are:Annual increase in net sales: 5–10% a yearOperating profit: 8%Return on equity: more than 20%Gearing: less than 130%With regard to Aspo’s businesses  ESL Shipping’s operating profit target is 14%  Telko’s 8% and Leipurin’s 5%. The operating profit rate targets are evaluated against the comparable operating profit rate of Aspo Group and its businesses.In Q1 2023  Aspo’s net sales from continuing operations increased by 10% to EUR 141.6 (128.8) million. The comparable operating profit rate of the continuing operations stood at 5.9% (6.7%). Return on equity remained close to the target level at 19.7% (21.2%) and gearing improved to 106.0% (108.4%).Aspo Group’s comparable operating profit from continuing and discontinued operationsAspo Group’s comparable operating profit includes results for continuing and discontinued operations. The comparable operating profit is calculated by adjusting the reported operating profit with rare and material items affecting the operating profit. These include impairment losses  sales gains from vessels  and financial losses caused by Russia’s invasion in Ukraine.Telko’s companies in Russia and Belarus  and Leipurin’s companies in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan were classified as held for sale in the 2022 financial statements (eastern businesses held for sale below). In the 2022 financial statements the results of the eastern businesses held for sale were reported as part of Telko and Leipurin segments  as well as Aspo Group’s continuing operations. The assets and liabilities of the eastern businesses held for sale were presented on the balance sheet separately as assets and liabilities held for sale.During the first quarter of 2023  Aspo has moved the eastern businesses held for sale to a new segment named Non-core businesses and at the same time  Aspo has classified the new segment as discontinued operations. The comparative profit and loss figures have been restated for all segments impacted by this financial reporting restructuring.The eastern businesses held for sale are measured at fair value less cost to sell. On divestment  the translation differences are recognized as part of the sales loss. At the end of the first quarter  the amount of the translation differences of the eastern businesses held for sale was EUR -13.2 million. The translation differences fluctuate according to changes in exchange rates until the date of the sale. The reclassification of the translation differences from the translation difference reserve to the result for the period will have no impact on Aspo Group’s total equity.The result of the discontinued operations in the comparative periods of 2022 also includes the operative result and divestment loss of Kauko Oy. Kauko Oy was divested on October 31 2022.Thus  the results of Kauko and the eastern businesses held for sale  which make up the result of the discontinued operations  are presented separate from the results of Aspo Group’s continuing operations  but the result of the discontinued operations are included in the presented “Group total” figures including the measure comparable operating profit  Group total.Net sales and operating profit margin  Group total 1-3/2023 1-3/2022 1-12/2022 MEUR MEUR MEUR Net sales  Group total 147.5 162.6 652.6 Net sales  continuing operations 141.6 128.8 560.7 Net sales  discontinued operations 5.9 33.8 91.9 Operating profit  Group total 8.5 10.1 31.2 Operating profit  Group total  % 5.8 6.2 4.8 Items affecting comparability 0.5 -4.9 -24.1 Comparable operating profit  Group total 8.0 15.0 55.3 Comparable operating profit  Group total  % 5.4 9.2 8.5Operating profit and comparable operating profit  Group total 1-3/2023 1-3/2022 1-12/2022 MEUR MEUR MEUR ESL Shipping  operating profit 6.0 9.2 38.2 Telko  operating profit 2.7 -2.0 8.2 Leipurin  operating profit 1.2 -0.8 -1.4 Other operations  operating profit -1.3 -2.4 -6.6 Operating profit from continuing operations 8.6 4.0 38.4 Operating profit from discontinued operations -0.1 6.1 -7.2 Operating profit  Group total 8.5 10.1 31.2 Items affecting comparability 0.5 -4.9 -24.1 Comparable operating profit  Group total 8.0 15.0 55.3In the first quarter of 2023  items affecting comparability totaled EUR 0.5 million. EUR 0.2 million of the items were reported in the Leipurin segment and consisted of the sales gain on the sale and lease back transaction of Kobia’s property in Gothenburg. EUR 0.3 million of the items come from the Non-core businesses segment and relate to valuation adjustments of the eastern businesses held for sale.The items affecting comparability in the first quarter of 2022  totaling EUR -4.9 million  consisted of EUR 1.5 million in sales gains from ESL Shipping barge Espa  ESL Shipping’s cost provisions of approximately EUR -0.2 million related to the war in Ukraine  EUR -2.6 million in losses from the destruction of Telko’s warehouse in Ukraine  a credit loss provision of EUR -2.0 million associated with Telko’s accounts receivables in Ukraine  EUR -0.7 million in losses from the destruction of Leipurin’s warehouse in Ukraine  a credit loss provision of EUR -0.2 million associated with Leipurin’s accounts receivable in Ukraine  and EUR -0.2 million of restructuring expenses in Russia. The items affecting comparability in other operations included the share-based payment of EUR -0.5 million granted to Aspo’s previous CEO.In 2022  items affecting comparability totaled EUR -24.1 million  of which EUR -20.7 million resulted from the impact of Russia’s invasion in Ukraine on Aspo Group’s business operations. Items affecting comparability relating to the Kauko segment totaled EUR -2.5 million. Other items affecting comparability totaled EUR -0.9 million.SustainabilitySustainability is a material factor which guides Aspo’s management system and especially the company’s investments. Aspo’s businesses aim to be forerunners in sustainability in their respective sectors. The key target is to reduce emission intensity  CO2 (tn) per net sales (EUR thousand)  by 30% by 2025. The starting point (2020) was 0.44  while the target level (2025) is 0.30. According to the green transition in the shipping industry  ESL Shipping is engaged in close and long-term cooperation with leading energy suppliers to provide fossil-free sea transportation for its key customers in the future. ESL Shipping is investing in twelve new generation electric hybrid vessels  half of which will remain in its own ownership and half will be transferred to the other party of the pooling arrangement. The investment is instrumental in the company’s green transition.During the past 12 months  emission intensity has kept improving and stood at 0.32 (0.33 for the full-year 2022)  driven by net sales growth in combination with operational efficiency and new operating models. The emission intensity target for the full-year 2023 is 0.36.Another key target is employee safety. The Total Recordable Injury Frequency (TRIF) has been developing favorably in the past quarters and was 8.8 (8.1 for the full-year 2022) for the past 12 months. The TRIF target for 2023 is 7.0.Operating environment and the impact of Russia’s invasion in Ukraine on Aspo’s operationsAspo’s operating environment is more stable compared to 2022 even though turbulence remains. Aspo’s commercial activities in eastern markets have significantly declined since Russia’s invasion in Ukraine and Aspo’s focus has been on full withdrawal from selected eastern markets. Major losses related to the withdrawal from selected eastern markets have been accounted for already in 2022 and only minor valuation adjustments are expected to arise during 2023. The translation differences will be accounted for as part of the sales losses  but it will not impact the total equity.The operating environment in the west has been more stable  however  changes in demand  inflation and rising interest rates have caused pressure on commercial activities  including pricing of products as well as on external financing. Volatile exchange rates also reflect the high inflation  which varies from one area to another causing fluctuations in demand. Aspo continues its business operations in Ukraine despite of the war. The market conditions are  however  demanding with no significant improvement in sight in the short term. Aspo continues to operate selectively in certain Central Asian countries like Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.Rising interest and inflation rates  as well as weaker general economic estimates  have affected consumers’ purchasing behavior  for example  so that consumers have shifted from more expensive to more affordable products. The coronavirus pandemic no longer significantly affects Aspo’s operations.ESL Shipping’s all operations were discontinued in Russia in 2022 and the whole capacity now operates in the western markets. Telko has agreed to sell all shares in its Russian subsidiary to GK Himik  a Russian industrial company. The closing of the deal took place in April. Telko is also in the process of winding-down its operations in Belarus. The sales and exit processes of Leipurin’s companies in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan are ongoing and they are expected to be completed during the first half of 2023. All of these companies are reported in the Non-core businesses segment and classified as discontinued operations.Net sales by market area  continuing operations 1-3/2023 Share 1-3/2022 Share 1-12/2022 Share MEUR % MEUR % MEUR % Finland 47.7 33.7 53.3 41.4 224.4 40.0 Scandinavian countries 41.4 29.2 28.6 22.2 137.6 24.5 Baltic countries 17.0 12.0 15.6 12.1 67.8 12.1 Other European countries 19.4 13.7 23.5 18.2 89.6 16.0 Other countries 16.1 11.3 7.8 6.1 41.3 7.4 Total 141.6 100 128.8 100 560.7 100Following the shift of the strategic focus towards western markets  Aspo has changed the market areas when reporting net sales. The new market areas are: Finland  Scandinavian countries  Baltic countries  Other European countries and Other countries. The acquisition of Kobia has significantly increased the contribution of Scandinavia in Group’s total net sales.Cash flow and financingThe Group’s net cash flow from operating activities in January–March was EUR 12.2 (15.2) million. The cash flows of all businesses were strong during the quarter. The cash flow impact of change in working capital was EUR -0.6 (-0.6) million. The slight increase in working capital originates from the increased accounts receivable  whereas the value of inventories decreased.The free cash flow in January–March was EUR 9.1 (13.8) million. Investments amounted to EUR 1.8 (2.8) million and consisted mainly of the ESL Shipping segment’s Green Coaster advance payments. In addition  the cash flow from investing activities includes EUR 3.7 million cash outflow from the acquisitions of Eltrex and EUR 2.4 million cash inflow from the sale of Kobia’s property in Gothenburg  Sweden.3/2023 3/2022 12/2022 MEUR MEUR MEUR Interest-bearing liabilities  incl. lease liabilities 192.3 202.3 189.2 Cash and cash equivalents 35.6 41.3 33.5 Net interest-bearing debt 156.7 161.0 155.7Net interest-bearing debt was EUR 156.7 (155.7) million and gearing decreased to 106.0% (108.4%). The Group’s equity ratio at the end of the review period was 34.8% (34.7%).Net financial expenses in January–March totaled EUR -1.9 (-1.1) million. The average interest rate of interest-bearing liabilities  excluding lease liabilities  rose strongly and was 3.7% (1.3%) increasing Aspo’s interest expenses. Exchange rate fluctuations increased fx-gains and affected positively the net financial expenses.The Group’s liquidity position remained strong. Cash and cash equivalents stood at EUR 35.6 (33.5) million at the end of the review period  of which cash and cash equivalents related to businesses held for sale were EUR 10.1 (11.8) million. Committed revolving credit facilities  totaling EUR 40 million  were fully unused  as in the comparative period. Aspo’s EUR 80 million commercial paper program also remained fully unused.Short-term risks and uncertainties in business operationsAspo and its subsidiaries are exposed to various risks and uncertainties. The most important risks and Aspo’s actions to mitigate these are summarized and reported to Aspo's Board of Directors through Aspo's Audit Committee.Russia’s invasion of Ukraine causes significant geopolitical uncertainties. It affects the general economic environment  including inflation  energy and raw material prices  interest rates  and consumers’ trust.The ongoing process to withdraw from Russia and other selected eastern markets will change the Group’s structure significantly and will affect the revenue model of Aspo’s businesses in the long term. There are risks that the withdrawal from selected markets cause additional costs or losses  and that funds cannot be transferred from the markets or that the withdrawal is unsuccessful in full or in part. It is also possible that the official approvals required for the withdrawal from the markets are not obtained for example due to changes is legislation or that they are at risk or fail for some other reason. As the money from the disposal of Telko Russia has been received these risks are now limited to Leipurin’s eastern operations.Financial activities and the prevailing geopolitical uncertainties have caused the prices of many raw materials  components and logistics services to rise rapidly. While Aspo may benefit from the price increases temporarily  the prices of raw materials or rental capacity  such as leased vessels  are increasing at the same time. Disruptions in logistics flows  longer delivery times for spare parts  components and raw materials  and any rapid price changes are also increasing risks. The rapid increase in inflation has generally caused pressure for salary increases  which can lead to labor disputes  which can also negatively affect Aspo's businesses.Overall economic development and energy price development cause changes in demand and price volatility of plastic and chemical based raw materials. Subsequently these will impact the financial performance of Telko  who does though benefit from a focus on more technical products  and wide product mix and scalability of operations.Overall economic development and specific demand and production volumes in key industries  such as metal  forest products  and energy  impact the demand of shipping. In this regard  ESL Shipping benefits from long-term industrial partnerships and a general deficit of all year-round vessel capacity in the Baltic Sea area.In line with its strategy  Aspo aims to increase its profit-making ability through acquisitions. Strategy execution may lead to a temporary deterioration in the balance sheet and capital structure in situations where acquisitions require financial resources and consequently may reduce solvency. With its strategy  Aspo aims to reduce the impact of the possibly weakening general economic development on Aspo’s profit-making ability.Because the future estimates presented in this interim report are based on the current situation and knowledge  they involve significant risks and other uncertainties  due to which actual future outcomes may differ from the estimates.ASPO’S BUSINESSESESL ShippingESL Shipping is the leading dry bulk sea transport company operating in the Baltic Sea area. ESL Shipping’s operations are mainly based on long-term customer contracts and established customer relationships. At the end of the review period  the shipping company’s fleet consisted of 42 vessels with a total capacity of 438 000 deadweight tons (dwt). Of these  23 were wholly owned (78% of the tonnage)  two were minority owned (2%) and the remaining 17 vessels (20%) were time chartered.ESL Shipping’s competitive edge is based on its pioneering role and ability to responsibly and energy efficiently secure product and raw material transportation for industries and energy production year-round  even in difficult conditions. The shipping company loads and unloads large ocean liners at sea as a special service.1-3/2023 1-3/2022 Change % Net sales  MEUR 52.7 56.8 -7 Operating profit  MEUR 6.0 9.2 -35 Operating profit  % 11.4 16.2 Items affecting comparability  MEUR 1.3 Comparable operating profit  MEUR 6.0 7.9 -24 Comparable operating profit  % 11.4 13.9In the first quarter  ESL Shipping’s net sales decreased by 7% from the previous year to EUR 52.7 (56.8) million. The comparable operating profit for the quarter decreased by 24% to EUR 6.0 (7.9) million  with the comparable operating profit rate being 11.4% (13.9%). Despite being lower than the record level of the previous year  the reported operating profit for the first quarter of 2023 can still be considered good.The anticipated unrest in Finland’s labor market materialized and the first quarter of 2023 was hampered by stevedore’s overtime ban and two weeks strike in most Finnish ports. As a result  cargo volumes transported by ESL Shipping decreased from the comparative period to 3.3 (3.8) million tons. Typical for a strike situation  the adverse effect to shipping company started approximately two weeks before the informed time of the strike and the traffic was normalized only 2-3 weeks after the strike ended.ESL Shipping’s handysize vessels had stable volume demand from long term partnership industries during the first quarter of 2023. Coaster vessel volumes suffered not only from the strike but also from severe capacity constraints due to limited availability of time charter tonnage and unexpected 35 days maintenance off-hire of two owned sister vessels. This in turn was caused by the inferior quality of machinery spare parts provided by their original equipment maker. For the company’s largest supramax vessels the spot cargo market activity and freight rate levels were significantly lower during the first quarter than during the comparative period.After operations in Russia were suspended one year ago  demand for ESL Shipping’s loading and unloading operations for vessels at sea shifted to the southern Baltic Sea where it was adversely affected by the lower-than-expected demand for energy coal transportation. Overall  continental Europe experienced a mild winter  which resulted in lower-than-expected energy industry shipping volumes. The share of energy coal transported by ESL Shipping returned to a clearly decreasing trend.During the quarter  the prices of diesel and liquefied natural gas (LNG) used as ship fuels continued to decrease from the previous quarter. Price of LNG has decreased to levels seen last time in the autumn of 2021. In historical context fuel prices are still high. The impact of energy price fluctuations on ESL Shipping’s costs is managed through fuel clauses in long-term transportation agreements.The newbuilding project of ESL Shipping’s Swedish subsidiary AtoBatC Shipping AB at the Chowgule & Company Private Limited shipyard in India proceeded as planned during the first quarter. Every other vessel in the series of 12 next-generation electric hybrid vessels will be sold  as announced earlier  to the company established by the pooling investor group. The first five new vessels are already under construction  and the first vessel is to be delivered during fall 2023.The shipping company’s long-term environmental activities focus on minimizing emissions to the sea and air. The aim is to halve carbon dioxide emissions per transportation unit by the end of the decade. During the first quarter of 2023  ESL Shipping’s vessels consumed 189 932 (226 212) MWh of energy. CO2 efficiency improved by 12.5% to 13.6 (15.5) grams of carbon dioxide per transported ton-mile. The new energy-efficient operating models applied to port visits supported the positive development.ESL Shipping outlook for 2023Opinions with regards to global demand estimates in sea transportation markets and price levels of spot markets are split. After a very slow start of the year the market for the larger tonnage has somewhat picked up again since the re-opening of China after Covid-19  but continental Europe  Baltic Sea and Scandinavia still remain as a very low activity market area. On the other hand  the availability of vessel capacity suitable for round-the-year operations in the Baltic Sea is limited and ESL Shipping’s long-term partners in the steel industry have fairly stable  albeit lower than in the previous year  volume expectations for the remaining part of 2023. In the forest industry  pulp delivery volumes are looking less positive than at the beginning of the year and sawn goods demand is only satisfactory  despite the fact that production capacity on the other hand is increasing. The role of energy coal transportation is expected to decrease significantly when the preparation situation returns to normal and demand shifts towards other energy forms. Demand for energy deliveries is expected to pick up only in the second half of the year.The majority of the shipping company’s transportation capacity has been secured through long-term agreements with the exception of the Supramax vessels. The expectations of the lessors of the time-chartered vessels continue not to meet the realities in the shipping company’s main market areas which may cause further uncertainties in the availability and pricing of a suitable and sufficient tonnage.ESL Shipping’s investments in energy-efficient vessels will strengthen its competitiveness and market position in the future. ESL Shipping will continue the development of a completely fossil-free sea transportation ecosystem in line with the green transition and the vessels designed for it in cooperation with its key customers. ESL Shipping is participating in projects aimed to produce green hydrogen through renewable electricity and to further process it into fossil-free fuel for the shipping company’s vessels.During the remaining part of 2023  four larger and two smaller vessels will be docked for a total of approximately 100 days. The larger vessels to be docked this year are the most profitable units in ESL Shipping’s fleet and therefore the result in Q2 and Q3 will be negatively affected.As informed in a separate stock exchange release on 26th April  Aspo‘s Board of Directors has decided to initiate a program to support and accelerate ESL Shipping’s low-carbon growth strategy. The program will assess alternative measures  including the launch of a second wave investment pool  a possible equity injection in ESL Shipping by a minority shareholder  and the sale of ESL Shipping’s two Supramax vessels  m/s Arkadia and m/s Kumpula. The measures are intended to enhance ESL Shipping’s capacity to execute its ESG driven strategy  including investments in new green vessels  to further focus ESL Shipping’s business scope  and improve its financial resilience. Aspo would in all scenarios remain as a committed majority owner of ESL Shipping.TelkoTelko is a leading expert in and supplier of plastic raw materials  industrial chemicals  and lubricants. It operates as a sustainable partner in the value chain  bringing well-known international principals and customers together. Its competitive edge is based on strong technical support  efficient logistics and local expert service. Telko operates in Finland  the Baltic countries  Scandinavia  Poland  Romania  Ukraine  Kazakhstan  Uzbekistan  and China.Operations of Telko’s subsidiaries in Russia and Belarus have been reclassified to Aspo’s new Non-core businesses segment. The financials of these subsidiaries are no longer included in the Telko segment. The comparative figures have been restated according to the new reporting structure.1-3/2023 1-3/2022 Change % Net sales  MEUR 54.3 50.6 7 Operating profit  MEUR 2.7 -2.0 -235 Operating profit  % 5.0 -4.0 Items affecting comparability  MEUR -4.6 Comparable operating profit  MEUR 2.7 2.6 4 Comparable operating profit  % 5.0 5.1In the first quarter of 2023  Telko’s net sales increased to EUR 54.3 (50.6) million and its comparable operating profit grew slightly to EUR 2.7 (2.6) million. Organic growth and the acquisition of Eltrex contributed positively to Telko’s sales growth  whereas the war clearly had a negative sales impact in Ukraine in comparison with the first quarter last year. Telko’s comparable operating profit rate was 5.0% (5.1%). In the comparative period  items affecting comparability amounting to EUR -4.6 million and were related to the destroyed warehouse in Ukraine and a credit loss provision associated with accounts receivable in Ukraine. Telko’s reported operating profit for the first quarter increased to EUR 2.7 (-2.0) million.Net sales of the plastics business decreased by 2% during the first quarter  amounting to EUR 26.6 (27.2) million. Demand in all segments was below average especially towards the end of the quarter when many customers lowered stock levels due to reduced order intake. Prices of volume plastics were mostly stable compared to the previous quarter but still about 15 % lower than in Q1 2022. Engineering plastics prices continued to decrease in general  but some product groups were going in the opposite direction mainly driven by production costs.Net sales of the chemicals business increased by 25% to EUR 15.1 (12.1) million. Demand remained relatively healthy in the main markets. Prices continued to decline in many product lines  but the development was quite balanced. On January 31  Telko acquired Eltrex  a Polish distributor of specialty chemicals and industrial packaging materials. Eltrex contributed EUR 1.4 million to the net sales during the quarter.Net sales of the lubricants business increased by 12% to EUR 12.6 (11.3) million. High demand especially for Industrial lubricants continued and resulted in sales volume growth. In Automotive lubricants demand remained stable. Telko has strengthened its position in Marine Lubricants and sales developed strongly during the quarter. During the first quarter prices of readymade lubricants stabilized after a long period of continuous increases. All prices are clearly above long-term average levels.Telko outlook for 2023Telko has faced significant changes in its business environment during the last year. Russia and Belarus played a significant role in Telko´s former business portfolio. Despite all the changes  the core of Telko´s strategy has remained and will remain the same. As a leading expert serving multiple industries  Telko is in a unique position to create value by improving our customers’ sustainability  productivity  and operational quality. Telko´s growth efforts will be increasingly focused on Europe  but the main components of the company´s value proposition will remain the same.In general  the business outlook in the European market looks somewhat softer than a year ago. Telko serves industrial customers in various industries. The possible changes in demand will be softened by the heterogenic cyclicality of the diversified customer base  and hence Telko’s business remains fairly resilient to changes in overall market development.In plastics  Telko does not anticipate sudden changes in demand during the second quarter. Prices will continue to be on the same or lowering trend due to overall weaker market demand both in volume and engineering plastics. Strict inventory control and careful purchasing will continue in the main customer segments. Customers will continue to lower their buffer inventories as the overall market outlook is softening and there are no more significant availability problems in the market. Prices of freight from Asia to Europe have lowered significantly from the record levels  which encourages increasing imports to the European market.In chemicals  healthy demand is expected to continue in key markets. Price erosion will continue in a controlled manner and some product lines already bottomed. The recently acquired Eltrex will have a positive impact on both sales and profitability.It is expected that for lubricants the demand will remain stable during the first half of the year. No significant price changes are expected during the first half of the year. The possible slower economic development might have an adverse impact on demand for lubricants during the second half of the year. Telko will continue to focus on increasing its market share in high performance lubricants  metal working fluids and marine lubricants.Sales in Ukraine are expected to pick up if the electricity supply situation remains stable. In any case sales in Ukraine during Q2 will be higher than in previous year  but significantly below pre-war levels. Solid growth is expected to continue in Central Asia.The recent acquisitions have proved to be successful  and they have had a positive impact on the existing businesses. Telko will accelerate its growth through acquisitions to achieve set strategic goals in all three business segments. Telko will also seek to strengthen its market share in existing markets through organic growth.In order to secure good profitability  Telko will further strengthen its cost efficiency and continue developing its operating model towards better scalability and flexibility. Good inventory control and capital efficiency will continue to be a high priority for Telko. The asset-light business model of Telko enables better ability to utilize new business opportunities and to react to changes in the business environment.LeipurinLeipurin operates as part of the food chain  acquiring raw materials in global markets and from domestic companies  and supplying them through its effective logistics chain according to customer needs. With operations in six countries including Finland  Sweden  Baltic countries  and Ukraine  Leipurin serves bakery  food industry  and foodservice customers by providing raw materials  supporting research & development  recipes  and innovations for new products. Leipurin also offers various supplies and machines for the same customer segments  partnering with leading international manufacturers for its raw material and machinery supply.Operations of Leipurin subsidiaries in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan have been reclassified to Aspo’s new Non-core businesses segment. The financials of these subsidiaries are no longer included in the Leipurin segment. The comparative figures have been restated according to the new reporting structure.1-3/2023 1-3/2022 Change % Net sales  MEUR 34.6 21.4 62 Operating profit  MEUR 1.2 -0.8 -250 Operating profit  % 3.5 -3.7 Items affecting comparability  MEUR 0.2 -0.9 Comparable operating profit  MEUR 1.0 0.1 900 Comparable operating profit  % 2.9 0.5Leipurin’s net sales increased by 62% during the first quarter to EUR 34.6 (21.4) million. In Finland net sales increased by 14% to EUR 11.9 (10.4) million. In the Baltic countries  net sales increased by 19% to EUR 9.4 (7.9) million. Net sales of the Ukraine business unit decreased by 40% to EUR 0.3 (0.5) million. Sweden was established as a new business unit as a result of the acquisition of Kobia AB on September 1  2022  and it contributed with EUR 13.0 million and approximately 38% of Leipurin’s net sales in the first quarter of 2023. Net sales of Q1 2022 included EUR 2.5 million net sales of the divested Vulganus Oy. During the first quarter  sales to bakeries increased by 80% to EUR 25.7 (14.3) million  driven by the Kobia acquisition. Sales to the food industry increased by 26% to EUR 2.9 (2.3) million.The steep increase in raw material prices in global markets continued to have an impact on Leipurin’s sales during the first quarter. Measured in kilo volume  the decline in sales continued in Finland  Sweden and the Baltic countries. The weak volume development was driven by factors such as consumer price shock resulting from inflation  high energy prices  and higher interest rates  as well as post-Covid-19 effects  where food retail sales declined after a surge during the pandemic  while food service consumption respectively recovered. Leipurin expects this phenomenon to stabilize and normalize during the year 2023  although consumer demand for more affordable products continues to drive market dynamics. In the case of Leipurin  the volume decrease has been predominantly in the low-margin commodity items  resulting in an improved product mix  so the positive development in gross profits continued even at slightly lower total volumes.The comparable operating profit for the first quarter stood at EUR 1.0 (0.1) million  and the comparable operating profit rate was 2.9% (0.5%). Items affecting comparability  totaling EUR 0.2 (-0.9) million  included the gain related to the sale and leaseback of Kobia’s property in Gothenburg. The comparability of the comparative period was affected by the destroyed warehouse in Ukraine and provision for credit losses with Ukrainian customers. Leipurin’s operating profit for the first quarter was EUR 1.2 (-0.8) million.Leipurin completed the sale and leaseback of the property in Gothenburg  Sweden in February 2023. In March  Leipurin also signed a sale and leaseback arrangement of the property in Hässleholm  Sweden  and expects to close this deal during the second quarter. The property in Hässleholm has been classified as assets held for sale in the balance sheet on the reporting date. Leipurin continues the efforts to complete a sale and leaseback transaction also of the properties in Tyresö  Sweden. These actions will release a significant share of the capital that was invested when acquiring Kobia AB.Leipurin outlook for 2023The expansion to Sweden through the acquisition of Kobia AB will contribute to Leipurin’s annual net sales by roughly EUR 50 million and generate considerable synergy benefits in product range development  supply chain  and procurement. It also enables partners to be served in a larger geographic area. The integration of operations and synergy capture have clearly progressed according to plan.Inflation and the rising energy prices  in particular  will have a negative impact on demand for more expensive products  potentially presenting profitability challenges among the bakery segment’s customers. The decreased purchasing power may have a negative impact on demand especially for artisan bakeries  as consumers shift towards more affordable products.The upward trend is expected to continue in the prices of main raw material categories  even though the rapid inflation during the review period is expected to decelerate considerably during this year.Despite these challenges  we see that the market will offer a highly stable environment in the long term and also opportunities for organic growth in selected market segments. With its new setup of Finland  Sweden and the Baltic countries forming the core business area  and being more clearly focused on food ingredient sales  Leipurin is now a more synergistic group. The management structure has been renewed and the operating model revised to drive and develop the business across Leipurin countries in this setup. The impact of Russia’s invasion in Ukraine on the global supply chains  the availability of certain raw materials  general delivery times and especially on market development and demand in Ukraine will continue  but with less effects on Leipurin’s business than last year.Management of payment defaults and claims has succeeded well at present. Profitability challenges will increase the risks of payment defaults and bankruptcies among customers and suppliers.Non-core businessesThe Non-core businesses segment includes Telko Russia and Belarus as well as Kauko GmbH previously reported in the Telko segment  Leipurin Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan previously reported in the Leipurin segment and ESL Shipping Russia previously reported in the ESL Shipping segment. The Non-core businesses segment was established to separate the results of the non-core businesses of Aspo from the results of the continuing businesses. All the entities in the segment are either held for sale or in the process of being closed down.Non-core 1-3/2023 1-3/2022 Change % Net sales  MEUR 5.9 31.6 -81 Operating profit  MEUR -0.1 6.3 -102 Operating profit  % -1.7 19.9 Items affecting comparability  MEUR 0.3 -0.2 Comparable operating profit  MEUR -0.4 6.5 -106 Comparable operating profit  % -6.8 20.6The net sales from the Non-core businesses declined by 81% during the first quarter to EUR 5.9 (31.6) million. The net sales of the Non-core businesses was split between Leipurin EUR 4.3 million and Telko EUR 1.6 million. The comparable operating profit was EUR -0.4 million. The operating profit of the Non-core businesses was EUR -0.1 (6.3) million. The Leipurin entities contributed positively to the comparable operating profit  but the Telko entities caused the negative comparable operating profit of the segment. The operating profit included EUR 0.3 million of items affecting comparability  which were caused by reversal of impairments due to decreased net assets of the eastern businesses held for sale. The net assets of the eastern businesses decreased more than their fair value  which caused the positive effect on the result.On April 19  after receiving the required approvals from the Russian authorities  Telko received the funds for the sale of the share capital of its Russian subsidiary to Russian industrial operator GK Himik. The original sales price was approximately EUR 9.5 million as announced in October 2022. The received sales price was EUR 5.7 million after mandatory valuation adjustments. Considering the already recognized write-downs  the transaction will not generate a material sales loss except for the translation differences which amount to approximately EUR -8.6 million. The reclassification of the translation differences does not reduce the equity of the Group.Other operationsOther operations include Aspo Group’s administration  finance and ICT service center. The comparable operating profit of other operations was EUR -1.3 (-1.9) million during the first quarter. The improved profitability derives from some restructuring activities at Aspo group level and more accurate expense allocation among group entities. The operating profit was EUR -1.3 (-2.4) million. In 2022  items affecting comparability of EUR -0.5 million were related to the additional share-based remuneration granted to Aspo’s previous CEO.COMPANY INFORMATIONAspo aims to achieve sustainable long-term growth by re-investing earned profits in profitable investment objects and by taking steps towards a compounder profile.

In the comparative period 3/2022 they include the assets and liabilities of Kauko operating segment.At the end of the first quarter of 2023 the Other assets held for sale include Kobia’s properties in Hässleholm  Sweden  which Kobia AB has agreed to sell and lease back. The deal is expected to be completed during the second quarter. In the comparative period 3/2022 the Other assets and liabilities held for sale include the assets and liabilities of Vulganus Oy  which was divested on June 30  2022.On the balance sheet  the assets and liabilities of discontinued operations and other assets and liabilities held for sale are reported under “Assets held for sale” and “Liabilities directly associated with assets classified as held for sale”. The reporting of balance sheet items on separate rows starts at the time of classification  therefore the balance sheet figures of the comparative periods have not been restated. The recognition of depreciation and amortization expense has ended for all non-current assets held for sale at the time of the classification as held for sale.Restricted cash and cash equivalentsIn Russia  Aspo Group has EUR 14.2 million in cash and cash equivalents  the use of which are strictly restricted by the Russian Government and controlled by the banks. The value of these cash and cash equivalents in the Group balance sheet is EUR 9.7 million  as impairments of EUR 4.5 million have been recognized on these cash and cash equivalents balances. Cash and cash equivalents in Russia are presented under assets held for sale on the balance sheet. In the first quarter of 2023 it was still possible to receive dividend payments and make commercial payments with Russian entities. After the end of the review period Aspo received payment of EUR 5.7 million for the sale of Telko Russia. According to our understanding and experience  also the sales price of the Leipurin entities classified as held for sale is expected to be received in conjunction with the sale of the entities. However  there is a risk that the Group does not have access to the cash and cash equivalents in full in Russia  which is why they must be considered restricted cash and cash equivalents in accordance with IAS 7.Events after the review periodOn April 19  after receiving the required approvals from the local authorities  Telko completed the sale of its Russian operations to a local industrial operator GK Himik.On April 26  Aspo announced that it is initiating a program to accelerate ESL Shipping’s low-carbon growth strategy. The aim is to assess a selection of alternative measures  including a launch of a new investment pool of green vessels  a possible equity injection in ESL Shipping by a minority shareholder  and the sales of the shipping company’s two Supramax vessels. Based on the program  preferred measures will be launched to enhance ESL Shipping’s capacity to execute its ESG-driven strategy. In all scenarios Aspo will remain a committed majority owner of ESL Shipping.Helsinki  May 3  2023Aspo PlcBoard of DirectorsPress and analyst conferenceA press  analyst and investor conference will be held at FLIK’s Eliel studio in Sanomatalo  Töölönlahdenkatu 2  00100 Helsinki on Wednesday May 3  2023  at 2 p.m. The event is also open to private investors  and participants are requested to register beforehand by emailing viestinta@aspo.com.The interim report will be presented by CEO Rolf Jansson.

Aspo has established a new segment structure and the figures for the comparative periods have been restated. January–March 2023 Aspo’s net sales from continuing operations increased to EUR 141.6 (128.8) million.Comparable operating profit from continuing operations was EUR 8.4 (8.7) million  and the comparable operating profit rate from continuing operations was 5.9% (6.7%).The comparable operating profit of ESL Shipping was EUR 6.0 (7.9) million  Telko EUR 2.7 (2.6) million  and Leipurin EUR 1.0 (0.1) million.Aspo’s net sales  Group total decreased to EUR 147.5 (162.6) million.Comparable operating profit  at Group total level was EUR 8.0 (15.0) million  and the operating profit rate was 5.4% (9.2%).Items affecting the comparability of operating profit totaled EUR 0.5 (-4.9) million at Group total level.Operating profit from continuing operations was EUR 8.6 (4.0) million. The operating profit rate of continuing operations was 6.1% (3.1%).The operating profit of ESL Shipping was EUR 6.0 (9.2) million  Telko EUR 2.7 (-2.0) million  and Leipurin EUR 1.2 (-0.8) million.Earnings per share were EUR 0.21 (0.21).Net cash from operating activities was EUR 12.2 (15.2) million. Free cash flow was EUR 9.1 (13.8) million. Guidance for 2023 Aspo Group’s comparable operating profit will be higher than EUR 35 (2022: 55.3) million in 2023. Restructuring of the financial reporting To provide a more transparent and clear view of its businesses  Aspo has established a new reportable segment called Non-core businesses. The Non-core businesses segment includes Telko Russia and Belarus as well as Kauko GmbH previously reported in the Telko segment  Leipurin Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan previously reported in the Leipurin segment  ESL Shipping Russia previously reported in the ESL Shipping segment. The Non-core businesses segment was established to separate the results of the non-core businesses of Aspo from the results of the continuing businesses. All the entities in the segment are either held for sale or in the process of being closed down. The comparative figures have been restated according to the new reporting structure.

In Q1  Telko and Leipurin improved their financial performance compared to last year  and ESL Shipping continued to show strong profitability in a more challenging business environment. The exits of Kauko and Vulganus in 2022  and cost reductions on the Group level contributed positively to our financial performance. Our net sales from continuing operations in the first quarter 2023 increased by 10% to EUR 141.6 (128.8) million. Telko and Leipurin showed solid growth  whereas ESL Shipping’s net sales somewhat decreased. Comparable operating profit from continuing operations amounted to EUR 8.4 (8.7) million. Capacity constraints of time-chartered vessels  a decline in financial performance of the Supramax vessels in addition to strikes and overtime bans weakened ESL Shipping’s profitability. Leipurin saw very positive development in both net sales growth and profitability driven by the Kobia acquisition  inflation and performance improvement measures. Telko’s profitability was slightly up year-on-year and net sales increased by approximately 7% driven by both organic as well as non-organic growth. Telko’s acquisition of Eltrex in late January displayed further evidence of the company’s compounder strategy. During the quarter  Leipurin freed up capital by completing a sale and leaseback of the property in Gothenburg  Sweden and signing a similar transaction for its property in Hässleholm  Sweden. Leipurin is still in the process of exiting Russia  Kazakhstan  and Belarus. We aim to complete this transaction by the summer 2023. In April  after receiving the required approvals from the local authorities  Telko completed the sale of its Russian operations to a local industrial operator GK Himik. The sale was an important milestone  and it frees up time and resources within the organization to focus on growth opportunities in Western markets. Telko Belarus is being closed down. In late April  we announced that we are initiating a program to accelerate ESL Shipping’s low-carbon growth strategy. The aim is to assess a selection of alternative measures  including the launch of a new investment pool of green vessels  a possible equity injection in ESL Shipping by a minority shareholder  and the sale of the shipping company’s two Supramax vessels. Based on the program  preferred measures will be launched to enhance ESL Shipping’s capacity to execute its ESG-driven strategy. In all scenarios Aspo will remain a committed majority owner of ESL Shipping. All of Aspo’s businesses are in a good position to execute their strategies and perform well financially. ASPO GROUP Financial results and targets Aspo's long-term financial targets are: Annual increase in net sales: 5–10% a yearOperating profit: 8%Return on equity: more than 20%Gearing: less than 130% With regard to Aspo’s businesses  ESL Shipping’s operating profit target is 14%  Telko’s 8% and Leipurin’s 5%. The operating profit rate targets are evaluated against the comparable operating profit rate of Aspo Group and its businesses. In Q1 2023  Aspo’s net sales from continuing operations increased by 10% to EUR 141.6 (128.8) million. The comparable operating profit rate of the continuing operations stood at 5.9% (6.7%). Return on equity remained close to the target level at 19.7% (21.2%) and gearing improved to 106.0% (108.4%). Aspo Group’s comparable operating profit from continuing and discontinued operations Aspo Group’s comparable operating profit includes results for continuing and discontinued operations. The comparable operating profit is calculated by adjusting the reported operating profit with rare and material items affecting the operating profit. These include impairment losses  sales gains from vessels  and financial losses caused by Russia’s invasion in Ukraine. Telko’s companies in Russia and Belarus  and Leipurin’s companies in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan were classified as held for sale in the 2022 financial statements (eastern businesses held for sale below). In the 2022 financial statements the results of the eastern businesses held for sale were reported as part of Telko and Leipurin segments  as well as Aspo Group’s continuing operations. The assets and liabilities of the eastern businesses held for sale were presented on the balance sheet separately as assets and liabilities held for sale. During the first quarter of 2023  Aspo has moved the eastern businesses held for sale to a new segment named Non-core businesses and at the same time  Aspo has classified the new segment as discontinued operations. The comparative profit and loss figures have been restated for all segments impacted by this financial reporting restructuring. The eastern businesses held for sale are measured at fair value less cost to sell. On divestment  the translation differences are recognized as part of the sales loss. At the end of the first quarter  the amount of the translation differences of the eastern businesses held for sale was EUR -13.2 million. The translation differences fluctuate according to changes in exchange rates until the date of the sale. The reclassification of the translation differences from the translation difference reserve to the result for the period will have no impact on Aspo Group’s total equity. The result of the discontinued operations in the comparative periods of 2022 also includes the operative result and divestment loss of Kauko Oy. Kauko Oy was divested on October 31 2022. Thus  the results of Kauko and the eastern businesses held for sale  which make up the result of the discontinued operations  are presented separate from the results of Aspo Group’s continuing operations  but the result of the discontinued operations are included in the presented “Group total” figures including the measure comparable operating profit  Group total.

EUR 0.2 million of the items were reported in the Leipurin segment and consisted of the sales gain on the sale and lease back transaction of Kobia’s property in Gothenburg. EUR 0.3 million of the items come from the Non-core businesses segment and relate to valuation adjustments of the eastern businesses held for sale. The items affecting comparability in the first quarter of 2022  totaling EUR -4.9 million  consisted of EUR 1.5 million in sales gains from ESL Shipping barge Espa  ESL Shipping’s cost provisions of approximately EUR -0.2 million related to the war in Ukraine  EUR -2.6 million in losses from the destruction of Telko’s warehouse in Ukraine  a credit loss provision of EUR -2.0 million associated with Telko’s accounts receivables in Ukraine  EUR -0.7 million in losses from the destruction of Leipurin’s warehouse in Ukraine  a credit loss provision of EUR -0.2 million associated with Leipurin’s accounts receivable in Ukraine  and EUR -0.2 million of restructuring expenses in Russia. The items affecting comparability in other operations included the share-based payment of EUR -0.5 million granted to Aspo’s previous CEO. In 2022  items affecting comparability totaled EUR -24.1 million  of which EUR -20.7 million resulted from the impact of Russia’s invasion in Ukraine on Aspo Group’s business operations. Items affecting comparability relating to the Kauko segment totaled EUR -2.5 million. Other items affecting comparability totaled EUR -0.9 million. Sustainability Sustainability is a material factor which guides Aspo’s management system and especially the company’s investments. Aspo’s businesses aim to be forerunners in sustainability in their respective sectors. The key target is to reduce emission intensity  CO2 (tn) per net sales (EUR thousand)  by 30% by 2025. The starting point (2020) was 0.44  while the target level (2025) is 0.30. According to the green transition in the shipping industry  ESL Shipping is engaged in close and long-term cooperation with leading energy suppliers to provide fossil-free sea transportation for its key customers in the future. ESL Shipping is investing in twelve new generation electric hybrid vessels  half of which will remain in its own ownership and half will be transferred to the other party of the pooling arrangement. The investment is instrumental in the company’s green transition. During the past 12 months  emission intensity has kept improving and stood at 0.32 (0.33 for the full-year 2022)  driven by net sales growth in combination with operational efficiency and new operating models. The emission intensity target for the full-year 2023 is 0.36. Another key target is employee safety. The Total Recordable Injury Frequency (TRIF) has been developing favorably in the past quarters and was 8.8 (8.1 for the full-year 2022) for the past 12 months. The TRIF target for 2023 is 7.0. Operating environment and the impact of Russia’s invasion in Ukraine on Aspo’s operations Aspo’s operating environment is more stable compared to 2022 even though turbulence remains. Aspo’s commercial activities in eastern markets have significantly declined since Russia’s invasion in Ukraine and Aspo’s focus has been on full withdrawal from selected eastern markets. Major losses related to the withdrawal from selected eastern markets have been accounted for already in 2022 and only minor valuation adjustments are expected to arise during 2023. The translation differences will be accounted for as part of the sales losses  but it will not impact the total equity. The operating environment in the west has been more stable  however  changes in demand  inflation and rising interest rates have caused pressure on commercial activities  including pricing of products as well as on external financing. Volatile exchange rates also reflect the high inflation  which varies from one area to another causing fluctuations in demand. Aspo continues its business operations in Ukraine despite of the war. The market conditions are  however  demanding with no significant improvement in sight in the short term. Aspo continues to operate selectively in certain Central Asian countries like Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. Rising interest and inflation rates  as well as weaker general economic estimates  have affected consumers’ purchasing behavior  for example  so that consumers have shifted from more expensive to more affordable products. The coronavirus pandemic no longer significantly affects Aspo’s operations. ESL Shipping’s all operations were discontinued in Russia in 2022 and the whole capacity now operates in the western markets. Telko has agreed to sell all shares in its Russian subsidiary to GK Himik  a Russian industrial company. The closing of the deal took place in April. Telko is also in the process of winding-down its operations in Belarus. The sales and exit processes of Leipurin’s companies in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan are ongoing and they are expected to be completed during the first half of 2023. All of these companies are reported in the Non-core businesses segment and classified as discontinued operations.

The new market areas are: Finland  Scandinavian countries  Baltic countries  Other European countries and Other countries. The acquisition of Kobia has significantly increased the contribution of Scandinavia in Group’s total net sales. Cash flow and financing The Group’s net cash flow from operating activities in January–March was EUR 12.2 (15.2) million. The cash flows of all businesses were strong during the quarter. The cash flow impact of change in working capital was EUR -0.6 (-0.6) million. The slight increase in working capital originates from the increased accounts receivable  whereas the value of inventories decreased. The free cash flow in January–March was EUR 9.1 (13.8) million. Investments amounted to EUR 1.8 (2.8) million and consisted mainly of the ESL Shipping segment’s Green Coaster advance payments. In addition  the cash flow from investing activities includes EUR 3.7 million cash outflow from the acquisitions of Eltrex and EUR 2.4 million cash inflow from the sale of Kobia’s property in Gothenburg  Sweden. 3/2023 3/2022 12/2022 MEUR MEUR MEUR Interest-bearing liabilities  incl. lease liabilities 192.3 202.3 189.2 Cash and cash equivalents 35.6 41.3 33.5 Net interest-bearing debt 156.7 161.0 155.7 Net interest-bearing debt was EUR 156.7 (155.7) million and gearing decreased to 106.0% (108.4%). The Group’s equity ratio at the end of the review period was 34.8% (34.7%). Net financial expenses in January–March totaled EUR -1.9 (-1.1) million. The average interest rate of interest-bearing liabilities  excluding lease liabilities  rose strongly and was 3.7% (1.3%) increasing Aspo’s interest expenses. Exchange rate fluctuations increased fx-gains and affected positively the net financial expenses. The Group’s liquidity position remained strong. Cash and cash equivalents stood at EUR 35.6 (33.5) million at the end of the review period  of which cash and cash equivalents related to businesses held for sale were EUR 10.1 (11.8) million. Committed revolving credit facilities  totaling EUR 40 million  were fully unused  as in the comparative period. Aspo’s EUR 80 million commercial paper program also remained fully unused. Short-term risks and uncertainties in business operations Aspo and its subsidiaries are exposed to various risks and uncertainties. The most important risks and Aspo’s actions to mitigate these are summarized and reported to Aspo's Board of Directors through Aspo's Audit Committee. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine causes significant geopolitical uncertainties. It affects the general economic environment  including inflation  energy and raw material prices  interest rates  and consumers’ trust. The ongoing process to withdraw from Russia and other selected eastern markets will change the Group’s structure significantly and will affect the revenue model of Aspo’s businesses in the long term. There are risks that the withdrawal from selected markets cause additional costs or losses  and that funds cannot be transferred from the markets or that the withdrawal is unsuccessful in full or in part. It is also possible that the official approvals required for the withdrawal from the markets are not obtained for example due to changes is legislation or that they are at risk or fail for some other reason. As the money from the disposal of Telko Russia has been received these risks are now limited to Leipurin’s eastern operations. Financial activities and the prevailing geopolitical uncertainties have caused the prices of many raw materials  components and logistics services to rise rapidly. While Aspo may benefit from the price increases temporarily  the prices of raw materials or rental capacity  such as leased vessels  are increasing at the same time. Disruptions in logistics flows  longer delivery times for spare parts  components and raw materials  and any rapid price changes are also increasing risks. The rapid increase in inflation has generally caused pressure for salary increases  which can lead to labor disputes  which can also negatively affect Aspo's businesses. Overall economic development and energy price development cause changes in demand and price volatility of plastic and chemical based raw materials. Subsequently these will impact the financial performance of Telko  who does though benefit from a focus on more technical products  and wide product mix and scalability of operations. Overall economic development and specific demand and production volumes in key industries  such as metal  forest products  and energy  impact the demand of shipping. In this regard  ESL Shipping benefits from long-term industrial partnerships and a general deficit of all year-round vessel capacity in the Baltic Sea area. In line with its strategy  Aspo aims to increase its profit-making ability through acquisitions. Strategy execution may lead to a temporary deterioration in the balance sheet and capital structure in situations where acquisitions require financial resources and consequently may reduce solvency. With its strategy  Aspo aims to reduce the impact of the possibly weakening general economic development on Aspo’s profit-making ability. Because the future estimates presented in this interim report are based on the current situation and knowledge  they involve significant risks and other uncertainties  due to which actual future outcomes may differ from the estimates. ASPO’S BUSINESSES ESL Shipping ESL Shipping is the leading dry bulk sea transport company operating in the Baltic Sea area. ESL Shipping’s operations are mainly based on long-term customer contracts and established customer relationships. At the end of the review period  the shipping company’s fleet consisted of 42 vessels with a total capacity of 438 000 deadweight tons (dwt). Of these  23 were wholly owned (78% of the tonnage)  two were minority owned (2%) and the remaining 17 vessels (20%) were time chartered. ESL Shipping’s competitive edge is based on its pioneering role and ability to responsibly and energy efficiently secure product and raw material transportation for industries and energy production year-round  even in difficult conditions. The shipping company loads and unloads large ocean liners at sea as a special service. 1-3/2023 1-3/2022 Change % Net sales  MEUR 52.7 56.8 -7 Operating profit  MEUR 6.0 9.2 -35 Operating profit  % 11.4 16.2 Items affecting comparability  MEUR 1.3 Comparable operating profit  MEUR 6.0 7.9 -24 Comparable operating profit  % 11.4 13.9 In the first quarter  ESL Shipping’s net sales decreased by 7% from the previous year to EUR 52.7 (56.8) million. The comparable operating profit for the quarter decreased by 24% to EUR 6.0 (7.9) million  with the comparable operating profit rate being 11.4% (13.9%). Despite being lower than the record level of the previous year  the reported operating profit for the first quarter of 2023 can still be considered good. The anticipated unrest in Finland’s labor market materialized and the first quarter of 2023 was hampered by stevedore’s overtime ban and two weeks strike in most Finnish ports. As a result  cargo volumes transported by ESL Shipping decreased from the comparative period to 3.3 (3.8) million tons. Typical for a strike situation  the adverse effect to shipping company started approximately two weeks before the informed time of the strike and the traffic was normalized only 2-3 weeks after the strike ended. ESL Shipping’s handysize vessels had stable volume demand from long term partnership industries during the first quarter of 2023. Coaster vessel volumes suffered not only from the strike but also from severe capacity constraints due to limited availability of time charter tonnage and unexpected 35 days maintenance off-hire of two owned sister vessels. This in turn was caused by the inferior quality of machinery spare parts provided by their original equipment maker. For the company’s largest supramax vessels the spot cargo market activity and freight rate levels were significantly lower during the first quarter than during the comparative period. After operations in Russia were suspended one year ago  demand for ESL Shipping’s loading and unloading operations for vessels at sea shifted to the southern Baltic Sea where it was adversely affected by the lower-than-expected demand for energy coal transportation. Overall  continental Europe experienced a mild winter  which resulted in lower-than-expected energy industry shipping volumes. The share of energy coal transported by ESL Shipping returned to a clearly decreasing trend. During the quarter  the prices of diesel and liquefied natural gas (LNG) used as ship fuels continued to decrease from the previous quarter. Price of LNG has decreased to levels seen last time in the autumn of 2021. In historical context fuel prices are still high. The impact of energy price fluctuations on ESL Shipping’s costs is managed through fuel clauses in long-term transportation agreements. The newbuilding project of ESL Shipping’s Swedish subsidiary AtoBatC Shipping AB at the Chowgule & Company Private Limited shipyard in India proceeded as planned during the first quarter. Every other vessel in the series of 12 next-generation electric hybrid vessels will be sold  as announced earlier  to the company established by the pooling investor group. The first five new vessels are already under construction  and the first vessel is to be delivered during fall 2023. The shipping company’s long-term environmental activities focus on minimizing emissions to the sea and air. The aim is to halve carbon dioxide emissions per transportation unit by the end of the decade. During the first quarter of 2023  ESL Shipping’s vessels consumed 189 932 (226 212) MWh of energy. CO2 efficiency improved by 12.5% to 13.6 (15.5) grams of carbon dioxide per transported ton-mile. The new energy-efficient operating models applied to port visits supported the positive development. ESL Shipping outlook for 2023 Opinions with regards to global demand estimates in sea transportation markets and price levels of spot markets are split. After a very slow start of the year the market for the larger tonnage has somewhat picked up again since the re-opening of China after Covid-19  but continental Europe  Baltic Sea and Scandinavia still remain as a very low activity market area. On the other hand  the availability of vessel capacity suitable for round-the-year operations in the Baltic Sea is limited and ESL Shipping’s long-term partners in the steel industry have fairly stable  albeit lower than in the previous year  volume expectations for the remaining part of 2023. In the forest industry  pulp delivery volumes are looking less positive than at the beginning of the year and sawn goods demand is only satisfactory  despite the fact that production capacity on the other hand is increasing. The role of energy coal transportation is expected to decrease significantly when the preparation situation returns to normal and demand shifts towards other energy forms. Demand for energy deliveries is expected to pick up only in the second half of the year. The majority of the shipping company’s transportation capacity has been secured through long-term agreements with the exception of the Supramax vessels. The expectations of the lessors of the time-chartered vessels continue not to meet the realities in the shipping company’s main market areas which may cause further uncertainties in the availability and pricing of a suitable and sufficient tonnage. ESL Shipping’s investments in energy-efficient vessels will strengthen its competitiveness and market position in the future. ESL Shipping will continue the development of a completely fossil-free sea transportation ecosystem in line with the green transition and the vessels designed for it in cooperation with its key customers. ESL Shipping is participating in projects aimed to produce green hydrogen through renewable electricity and to further process it into fossil-free fuel for the shipping company’s vessels. During the remaining part of 2023  four larger and two smaller vessels will be docked for a total of approximately 100 days. The larger vessels to be docked this year are the most profitable units in ESL Shipping’s fleet and therefore the result in Q2 and Q3 will be negatively affected. As informed in a separate stock exchange release on 26th April  Aspo‘s Board of Directors has decided to initiate a program to support and accelerate ESL Shipping’s low-carbon growth strategy. The program will assess alternative measures  including the launch of a second wave investment pool  a possible equity injection in ESL Shipping by a minority shareholder  and the sale of ESL Shipping’s two Supramax vessels  m/s Arkadia and m/s Kumpula. The measures are intended to enhance ESL Shipping’s capacity to execute its ESG driven strategy  including investments in new green vessels  to further focus ESL Shipping’s business scope  and improve its financial resilience. Aspo would in all scenarios remain as a committed majority owner of ESL Shipping. Telko Telko is a leading expert in and supplier of plastic raw materials  industrial chemicals  and lubricants. It operates as a sustainable partner in the value chain  bringing well-known international principals and customers together. Its competitive edge is based on strong technical support  efficient logistics and local expert service. Telko operates in Finland  the Baltic countries  Scandinavia  Poland  Romania  Ukraine  Kazakhstan  Uzbekistan  and China. Operations of Telko’s subsidiaries in Russia and Belarus have been reclassified to Aspo’s new Non-core businesses segment. The financials of these subsidiaries are no longer included in the Telko segment. The comparative figures have been restated according to the new reporting structure. 1-3/2023 1-3/2022 Change % Net sales  MEUR 54.3 50.6 7 Operating profit  MEUR 2.7 -2.0 -235 Operating profit  % 5.0 -4.0 Items affecting comparability  MEUR -4.6 Comparable operating profit  MEUR 2.7 2.6 4 Comparable operating profit  % 5.0 5.1 In the first quarter of 2023  Telko’s net sales increased to EUR 54.3 (50.6) million and its comparable operating profit grew slightly to EUR 2.7 (2.6) million. Organic growth and the acquisition of Eltrex contributed positively to Telko’s sales growth  whereas the war clearly had a negative sales impact in Ukraine in comparison with the first quarter last year. Telko’s comparable operating profit rate was 5.0% (5.1%). In the comparative period  items affecting comparability amounting to EUR -4.6 million and were related to the destroyed warehouse in Ukraine and a credit loss provision associated with accounts receivable in Ukraine. Telko’s reported operating profit for the first quarter increased to EUR 2.7 (-2.0) million. Net sales of the plastics business decreased by 2% during the first quarter  amounting to EUR 26.6 (27.2) million. Demand in all segments was below average especially towards the end of the quarter when many customers lowered stock levels due to reduced order intake. Prices of volume plastics were mostly stable compared to the previous quarter but still about 15 % lower than in Q1 2022. Engineering plastics prices continued to decrease in general  but some product groups were going in the opposite direction mainly driven by production costs. Net sales of the chemicals business increased by 25% to EUR 15.1 (12.1) million. Demand remained relatively healthy in the main markets. Prices continued to decline in many product lines  but the development was quite balanced. On January 31  Telko acquired Eltrex  a Polish distributor of specialty chemicals and industrial packaging materials. Eltrex contributed EUR 1.4 million to the net sales during the quarter. Net sales of the lubricants business increased by 12% to EUR 12.6 (11.3) million. High demand especially for Industrial lubricants continued and resulted in sales volume growth. In Automotive lubricants demand remained stable. Telko has strengthened its position in Marine Lubricants and sales developed strongly during the quarter. During the first quarter prices of readymade lubricants stabilized after a long period of continuous increases. All prices are clearly above long-term average levels. Telko outlook for 2023 Telko has faced significant changes in its business environment during the last year. Russia and Belarus played a significant role in Telko´s former business portfolio. Despite all the changes  the core of Telko´s strategy has remained and will remain the same. As a leading expert serving multiple industries  Telko is in a unique position to create value by improving our customers’ sustainability  productivity  and operational quality. Telko´s growth efforts will be increasingly focused on Europe  but the main components of the company´s value proposition will remain the same. In general  the business outlook in the European market looks somewhat softer than a year ago. Telko serves industrial customers in various industries. The possible changes in demand will be softened by the heterogenic cyclicality of the diversified customer base  and hence Telko’s business remains fairly resilient to changes in overall market development. In plastics  Telko does not anticipate sudden changes in demand during the second quarter. Prices will continue to be on the same or lowering trend due to overall weaker market demand both in volume and engineering plastics. Strict inventory control and careful purchasing will continue in the main customer segments. Customers will continue to lower their buffer inventories as the overall market outlook is softening and there are no more significant availability problems in the market. Prices of freight from Asia to Europe have lowered significantly from the record levels  which encourages increasing imports to the European market. In chemicals  healthy demand is expected to continue in key markets. Price erosion will continue in a controlled manner and some product lines already bottomed. The recently acquired Eltrex will have a positive impact on both sales and profitability. It is expected that for lubricants the demand will remain stable during the first half of the year. No significant price changes are expected during the first half of the year. The possible slower economic development might have an adverse impact on demand for lubricants during the second half of the year. Telko will continue to focus on increasing its market share in high performance lubricants  metal working fluids and marine lubricants. Sales in Ukraine are expected to pick up if the electricity supply situation remains stable. In any case sales in Ukraine during Q2 will be higher than in previous year  but significantly below pre-war levels. Solid growth is expected to continue in Central Asia. The recent acquisitions have proved to be successful  and they have had a positive impact on the existing businesses. Telko will accelerate its growth through acquisitions to achieve set strategic goals in all three business segments. Telko will also seek to strengthen its market share in existing markets through organic growth. In order to secure good profitability  Telko will further strengthen its cost efficiency and continue developing its operating model towards better scalability and flexibility. Good inventory control and capital efficiency will continue to be a high priority for Telko. The asset-light business model of Telko enables better ability to utilize new business opportunities and to react to changes in the business environment. Leipurin Leipurin operates as part of the food chain  acquiring raw materials in global markets and from domestic companies  and supplying them through its effective logistics chain according to customer needs. With operations in six countries including Finland  Sweden  Baltic countries  and Ukraine  Leipurin serves bakery  food industry  and foodservice customers by providing raw materials  supporting research & development  recipes  and innovations for new products. Leipurin also offers various supplies and machines for the same customer segments  partnering with leading international manufacturers for its raw material and machinery supply. Operations of Leipurin subsidiaries in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan have been reclassified to Aspo’s new Non-core businesses segment. The financials of these subsidiaries are no longer included in the Leipurin segment. The comparative figures have been restated according to the new reporting structure. 1-3/2023 1-3/2022 Change % Net sales  MEUR 34.6 21.4 62 Operating profit  MEUR 1.2 -0.8 -250 Operating profit  % 3.5 -3.7 Items affecting comparability  MEUR 0.2 -0.9 Comparable operating profit  MEUR 1.0 0.1 900 Comparable operating profit  % 2.9 0.5 Leipurin’s net sales increased by 62% during the first quarter to EUR 34.6 (21.4) million. In Finland net sales increased by 14% to EUR 11.9 (10.4) million. In the Baltic countries  net sales increased by 19% to EUR 9.4 (7.9) million. Net sales of the Ukraine business unit decreased by 40% to EUR 0.3 (0.5) million. Sweden was established as a new business unit as a result of the acquisition of Kobia AB on September 1  2022  and it contributed with EUR 13.0 million and approximately 38% of Leipurin’s net sales in the first quarter of 2023. Net sales of Q1 2022 included EUR 2.5 million net sales of the divested Vulganus Oy. During the first quarter  sales to bakeries increased by 80% to EUR 25.7 (14.3) million  driven by the Kobia acquisition. Sales to the food industry increased by 26% to EUR 2.9 (2.3) million. The steep increase in raw material prices in global markets continued to have an impact on Leipurin’s sales during the first quarter. Measured in kilo volume  the decline in sales continued in Finland  Sweden and the Baltic countries. The weak volume development was driven by factors such as consumer price shock resulting from inflation  high energy prices  and higher interest rates  as well as post-Covid-19 effects  where food retail sales declined after a surge during the pandemic  while food service consumption respectively recovered. Leipurin expects this phenomenon to stabilize and normalize during the year 2023  although consumer demand for more affordable products continues to drive market dynamics. In the case of Leipurin  the volume decrease has been predominantly in the low-margin commodity items  resulting in an improved product mix  so the positive development in gross profits continued even at slightly lower total volumes. The comparable operating profit for the first quarter stood at EUR 1.0 (0.1) million  and the comparable operating profit rate was 2.9% (0.5%). Items affecting comparability  totaling EUR 0.2 (-0.9) million  included the gain related to the sale and leaseback of Kobia’s property in Gothenburg. The comparability of the comparative period was affected by the destroyed warehouse in Ukraine and provision for credit losses with Ukrainian customers. Leipurin’s operating profit for the first quarter was EUR 1.2 (-0.8) million. Leipurin completed the sale and leaseback of the property in Gothenburg  Sweden in February 2023. In March  Leipurin also signed a sale and leaseback arrangement of the property in Hässleholm  Sweden  and expects to close this deal during the second quarter. The property in Hässleholm has been classified as assets held for sale in the balance sheet on the reporting date. Leipurin continues the efforts to complete a sale and leaseback transaction also of the properties in Tyresö  Sweden. These actions will release a significant share of the capital that was invested when acquiring Kobia AB. Leipurin outlook for 2023 The expansion to Sweden through the acquisition of Kobia AB will contribute to Leipurin’s annual net sales by roughly EUR 50 million and generate considerable synergy benefits in product range development  supply chain  and procurement. It also enables partners to be served in a larger geographic area. The integration of operations and synergy capture have clearly progressed according to plan. Inflation and the rising energy prices  in particular  will have a negative impact on demand for more expensive products  potentially presenting profitability challenges among the bakery segment’s customers. The decreased purchasing power may have a negative impact on demand especially for artisan bakeries  as consumers shift towards more affordable products. The upward trend is expected to continue in the prices of main raw material categories  even though the rapid inflation during the review period is expected to decelerate considerably during this year. Despite these challenges  we see that the market will offer a highly stable environment in the long term and also opportunities for organic growth in selected market segments. With its new setup of Finland  Sweden and the Baltic countries forming the core business area  and being more clearly focused on food ingredient sales  Leipurin is now a more synergistic group. The management structure has been renewed and the operating model revised to drive and develop the business across Leipurin countries in this setup. The impact of Russia’s invasion in Ukraine on the global supply chains  the availability of certain raw materials  general delivery times and especially on market development and demand in Ukraine will continue  but with less effects on Leipurin’s business than last year. Management of payment defaults and claims has succeeded well at present. Profitability challenges will increase the risks of payment defaults and bankruptcies among customers and suppliers. Non-core businesses The Non-core businesses segment includes Telko Russia and Belarus as well as Kauko GmbH previously reported in the Telko segment  Leipurin Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan previously reported in the Leipurin segment and ESL Shipping Russia previously reported in the ESL Shipping segment. The Non-core businesses segment was established to separate the results of the non-core businesses of Aspo from the results of the continuing businesses. All the entities in the segment are either held for sale or in the process of being closed down. Non-core 1-3/2023 1-3/2022 Change % Net sales  MEUR 5.9 31.6 -81 Operating profit  MEUR -0.1 6.3 -102 Operating profit  % -1.7 19.9 Items affecting comparability  MEUR 0.3 -0.2 Comparable operating profit  MEUR -0.4 6.5 -106 Comparable operating profit  % -6.8 20.6 The net sales from the Non-core businesses declined by 81% during the first quarter to EUR 5.9 (31.6) million. The net sales of the Non-core businesses was split between Leipurin EUR 4.3 million and Telko EUR 1.6 million. The comparable operating profit was EUR -0.4 million. The operating profit of the Non-core businesses was EUR -0.1 (6.3) million. The Leipurin entities contributed positively to the comparable operating profit  but the Telko entities caused the negative comparable operating profit of the segment. The operating profit included EUR 0.3 million of items affecting comparability  which were caused by reversal of impairments due to decreased net assets of the eastern businesses held for sale. The net assets of the eastern businesses decreased more than their fair value  which caused the positive effect on the result. On April 19  after receiving the required approvals from the Russian authorities  Telko received the funds for the sale of the share capital of its Russian subsidiary to Russian industrial operator GK Himik. The original sales price was approximately EUR 9.5 million as announced in October 2022. The received sales price was EUR 5.7 million after mandatory valuation adjustments. Considering the already recognized write-downs  the transaction will not generate a material sales loss except for the translation differences which amount to approximately EUR -8.6 million. The reclassification of the translation differences does not reduce the equity of the Group. Other operations Other operations include Aspo Group’s administration  finance and ICT service center. The comparable operating profit of other operations was EUR -1.3 (-1.9) million during the first quarter. The improved profitability derives from some restructuring activities at Aspo group level and more accurate expense allocation among group entities. The operating profit was EUR -1.3 (-2.4) million. In 2022  items affecting comparability of EUR -0.5 million were related to the additional share-based remuneration granted to Aspo’s previous CEO.COMPANY INFORMATION Aspo aims to achieve sustainable long-term growth by re-investing earned profits in profitable investment objects and by taking steps towards a compounder profile.

The estimated total consideration of EUR 4.8 million will be paid fully in cash  and EUR 3.7 million has already been paid. The rest of the consideration will be paid in the years 2024 and 2025 based on the earn-out clause of the purchase agreement. The assets and liabilities of the acquired company were measured at fair value on the acquisition date. A fair value allocation of EUR 3.1 million was made on intangible assets based on customer relationships  non-compete clauses and trademarks  and the fair value adjustment relating to inventories was EUR 0.1 million. The deferred tax liability arising from the fair value adjustments was EUR 0.6 million. The carrying amount of the other acquired assets and liabilities were deemed to correspond to their fair values. A goodwill balance of EUR 1.2 million resulted from the acquisition. The acquisition-related costs of approximately EUR 0.4 million were recognized in the Telko segment’s other operating expenses.

In 2022  the cash flow from the divestment of Kauko Oy EUR -1.0 million  is included in the cash flow from investing activities. The cost to sell Kauko of EUR -0.4 million is presented in the cash flow from operating activities.

In the comparative period 3/2022 they include the assets and liabilities of Kauko operating segment. At the end of the first quarter of 2023 the Other assets held for sale include Kobia’s properties in Hässleholm  Sweden  which Kobia AB has agreed to sell and lease back. The deal is expected to be completed during the second quarter. In the comparative period 3/2022 the Other assets and liabilities held for sale include the assets and liabilities of Vulganus Oy  which was divested on June 30  2022. On the balance sheet  the assets and liabilities of discontinued operations and other assets and liabilities held for sale are reported under “Assets held for sale” and “Liabilities directly associated with assets classified as held for sale”. The reporting of balance sheet items on separate rows starts at the time of classification  therefore the balance sheet figures of the comparative periods have not been restated. The recognition of depreciation and amortization expense has ended for all non-current assets held for sale at the time of the classification as held for sale. Restricted cash and cash equivalents In Russia  Aspo Group has EUR 14.2 million in cash and cash equivalents  the use of which are strictly restricted by the Russian Government and controlled by the banks. The value of these cash and cash equivalents in the Group balance sheet is EUR 9.7 million  as impairments of EUR 4.5 million have been recognized on these cash and cash equivalents balances. Cash and cash equivalents in Russia are presented under assets held for sale on the balance sheet. In the first quarter of 2023 it was still possible to receive dividend payments and make commercial payments with Russian entities. After the end of the review period Aspo received payment of EUR 5.7 million for the sale of Telko Russia. According to our understanding and experience  also the sales price of the Leipurin entities classified as held for sale is expected to be received in conjunction with the sale of the entities. However  there is a risk that the Group does not have access to the cash and cash equivalents in full in Russia  which is why they must be considered restricted cash and cash equivalents in accordance with IAS 7. Events after the review period On April 19  after receiving the required approvals from the local authorities  Telko completed the sale of its Russian operations to a local industrial operator GK Himik. On April 26  Aspo announced that it is initiating a program to accelerate ESL Shipping’s low-carbon growth strategy. The aim is to assess a selection of alternative measures  including a launch of a new investment pool of green vessels  a possible equity injection in ESL Shipping by a minority shareholder  and the sales of the shipping company’s two Supramax vessels. Based on the program  preferred measures will be launched to enhance ESL Shipping’s capacity to execute its ESG-driven strategy. In all scenarios Aspo will remain a committed majority owner of ESL Shipping.

The Non-core businesses segment includes Telko Russia and Belarus as well as Kauko GmbH previously reported in the Telko segment  Leipurin Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan previously reported in the Leipurin segment  ESL Shipping Russia previously reported in the ESL Shipping segment. The Non-core businesses segment was established to separate the results of the non-core businesses of Aspo from the results of the continuing businesses. All the entities in the segment are either held for sale or in the process of being closed down. The comparative figures have been restated according to the new reporting structure.Key figures 1-3/2023 1-3/2022 1-12/2022 Net sales  Group total  MEUR 147.5 162.6 652.6 Net sales from continuing operations  MEUR 141.6 128.8 560.7 ESL Shipping  comparable operating profit  MEUR 6.0 7.9 37.4 Telko  comparable operating profit  MEUR 2.7 2.6 11.3 Leipurin  comparable operating profit  MEUR 1.0 0.1 1.1 Other operations  comparable operating profit  MEUR -1.3 -1.9 -5.9 Comparable operating profit from continuing operations  MEUR 8.4 8.7 43.9 Comparable operating profit from continuing operations  % 5.9 6.7 6.8 Comparable operating profit from discontinued operations  MEUR -0.4 6.3 11.4 Comparable operating profit  Group total  MEUR 8.0 15.0 55.3 Comparable operating profit  Group total  % 5.4 9.2 8.5 Items affecting comparability  Group total  MEUR 0.5 -4.9 -24.1 Operating profit  Group total  MEUR 8.5 10.1 31.2 Profit before taxes from continuing operations  MEUR 6.7 2.9 32.5 Profit for the period  MEUR 7.2 7.0 20.7 Profit from continuing operations  MEUR 6.4 2.8 30.8 Profit from discontinued operations  MEUR 0.8 4.2 -10.1 Earnings per share (EPS)  EUR 0.21 0.21 0.61 EPS from continuing operations  EUR 0.19 0.08 0.93 EPS from discontinued operations  EUR 0.02 0.13 -0.32 Net cash from operating activities  MEUR 12.2 15.2 67.7 Free cash flow  MEUR 9.1 13.8 34.4 Return on equity (ROE)  % 19.7 21.2 15.2 Equity ratio  % 34.8 31.4 34.7 Gearing  % 106.0 118.8 108.4 Equity per share  EUR 4.71 4.28 4.58Rolf Jansson  CEO of Aspo Group  comments on the first quarter of 2023:Aspo’s strategy execution has progressed well. In Q1  Telko and Leipurin improved their financial performance compared to last year  and ESL Shipping continued to show strong profitability in a more challenging business environment. The exits of Kauko and Vulganus in 2022  and cost reductions on the Group level contributed positively to our financial performance.Our net sales from continuing operations in the first quarter 2023 increased by 10% to EUR 141.6 (128.8) million. Telko and Leipurin showed solid growth  whereas ESL Shipping’s net sales somewhat decreased. Comparable operating profit from continuing operations amounted to EUR 8.4 (8.7) million. Capacity constraints of time-chartered vessels  a decline in financial performance of the Supramax vessels in addition to strikes and overtime bans weakened ESL Shipping’s profitability. Leipurin saw very positive development in both net sales growth and profitability driven by the Kobia acquisition  inflation and performance improvement measures. Telko’s profitability was slightly up year-on-year and net sales increased by approximately 7% driven by both organic as well as non-organic growth. Telko’s acquisition of Eltrex in late January displayed further evidence of the company’s compounder strategy.During the quarter  Leipurin freed up capital by completing a sale and leaseback of the property in Gothenburg  Sweden and signing a similar transaction for its property in Hässleholm  Sweden. Leipurin is still in the process of exiting Russia  Kazakhstan  and Belarus. We aim to complete this transaction by the summer 2023.In April  after receiving the required approvals from the local authorities  Telko completed the sale of its Russian operations to a local industrial operator GK Himik. The sale was an important milestone  and it frees up time and resources within the organization to focus on growth opportunities in Western markets. Telko Belarus is being closed down.In late April  we announced that we are initiating a program to accelerate ESL Shipping’s low-carbon growth strategy. The aim is to assess a selection of alternative measures  including the launch of a new investment pool of green vessels  a possible equity injection in ESL Shipping by a minority shareholder  and the sale of the shipping company’s two Supramax vessels. Based on the program  preferred measures will be launched to enhance ESL Shipping’s capacity to execute its ESG-driven strategy. In all scenarios Aspo will remain a committed majority owner of ESL Shipping.All of Aspo’s businesses are in a good position to execute their strategies and perform well financially.ASPO GROUPFinancial results and targetsAspo's long-term financial targets are:Annual increase in net sales: 5–10% a yearOperating profit: 8%Return on equity: more than 20%Gearing: less than 130%With regard to Aspo’s businesses  ESL Shipping’s operating profit target is 14%  Telko’s 8% and Leipurin’s 5%. The operating profit rate targets are evaluated against the comparable operating profit rate of Aspo Group and its businesses.In Q1 2023  Aspo’s net sales from continuing operations increased by 10% to EUR 141.6 (128.8) million. The comparable operating profit rate of the continuing operations stood at 5.9% (6.7%). Return on equity remained close to the target level at 19.7% (21.2%) and gearing improved to 106.0% (108.4%).Aspo Group’s comparable operating profit from continuing and discontinued operationsAspo Group’s comparable operating profit includes results for continuing and discontinued operations. The comparable operating profit is calculated by adjusting the reported operating profit with rare and material items affecting the operating profit. These include impairment losses  sales gains from vessels  and financial losses caused by Russia’s invasion in Ukraine.Telko’s companies in Russia and Belarus  and Leipurin’s companies in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan were classified as held for sale in the 2022 financial statements (eastern businesses held for sale below). In the 2022 financial statements the results of the eastern businesses held for sale were reported as part of Telko and Leipurin segments  as well as Aspo Group’s continuing operations. The assets and liabilities of the eastern businesses held for sale were presented on the balance sheet separately as assets and liabilities held for sale.During the first quarter of 2023  Aspo has moved the eastern businesses held for sale to a new segment named Non-core businesses and at the same time  Aspo has classified the new segment as discontinued operations. The comparative profit and loss figures have been restated for all segments impacted by this financial reporting restructuring.The eastern businesses held for sale are measured at fair value less cost to sell. On divestment  the translation differences are recognized as part of the sales loss. At the end of the first quarter  the amount of the translation differences of the eastern businesses held for sale was EUR -13.2 million. The translation differences fluctuate according to changes in exchange rates until the date of the sale. The reclassification of the translation differences from the translation difference reserve to the result for the period will have no impact on Aspo Group’s total equity.The result of the discontinued operations in the comparative periods of 2022 also includes the operative result and divestment loss of Kauko Oy. Kauko Oy was divested on October 31 2022.Thus  the results of Kauko and the eastern businesses held for sale  which make up the result of the discontinued operations  are presented separate from the results of Aspo Group’s continuing operations  but the result of the discontinued operations are included in the presented “Group total” figures including the measure comparable operating profit  Group total.Net sales and operating profit margin  Group total 1-3/2023 1-3/2022 1-12/2022 MEUR MEUR MEUR Net sales  Group total 147.5 162.6 652.6 Net sales  continuing operations 141.6 128.8 560.7 Net sales  discontinued operations 5.9 33.8 91.9 Operating profit  Group total 8.5 10.1 31.2 Operating profit  Group total  % 5.8 6.2 4.8 Items affecting comparability 0.5 -4.9 -24.1 Comparable operating profit  Group total 8.0 15.0 55.3 Comparable operating profit  Group total  % 5.4 9.2 8.5Operating profit and comparable operating profit  Group total 1-3/2023 1-3/2022 1-12/2022 MEUR MEUR MEUR ESL Shipping  operating profit 6.0 9.2 38.2 Telko  operating profit 2.7 -2.0 8.2 Leipurin  operating profit 1.2 -0.8 -1.4 Other operations  operating profit -1.3 -2.4 -6.6 Operating profit from continuing operations 8.6 4.0 38.4 Operating profit from discontinued operations -0.1 6.1 -7.2 Operating profit  Group total 8.5 10.1 31.2 Items affecting comparability 0.5 -4.9 -24.1 Comparable operating profit  Group total 8.0 15.0 55.3In the first quarter of 2023  items affecting comparability totaled EUR 0.5 million.

EUR 0.3 million of the items come from the Non-core businesses segment and relate to valuation adjustments of the eastern businesses held for sale.The items affecting comparability in the first quarter of 2022  totaling EUR -4.9 million  consisted of EUR 1.5 million in sales gains from ESL Shipping barge Espa  ESL Shipping’s cost provisions of approximately EUR -0.2 million related to the war in Ukraine  EUR -2.6 million in losses from the destruction of Telko’s warehouse in Ukraine  a credit loss provision of EUR -2.0 million associated with Telko’s accounts receivables in Ukraine  EUR -0.7 million in losses from the destruction of Leipurin’s warehouse in Ukraine  a credit loss provision of EUR -0.2 million associated with Leipurin’s accounts receivable in Ukraine  and EUR -0.2 million of restructuring expenses in Russia. The items affecting comparability in other operations included the share-based payment of EUR -0.5 million granted to Aspo’s previous CEO.In 2022  items affecting comparability totaled EUR -24.1 million  of which EUR -20.7 million resulted from the impact of Russia’s invasion in Ukraine on Aspo Group’s business operations. Items affecting comparability relating to the Kauko segment totaled EUR -2.5 million. Other items affecting comparability totaled EUR -0.9 million.SustainabilitySustainability is a material factor which guides Aspo’s management system and especially the company’s investments. Aspo’s businesses aim to be forerunners in sustainability in their respective sectors. The key target is to reduce emission intensity  CO2 (tn) per net sales (EUR thousand)  by 30% by 2025. The starting point (2020) was 0.44  while the target level (2025) is 0.30. According to the green transition in the shipping industry  ESL Shipping is engaged in close and long-term cooperation with leading energy suppliers to provide fossil-free sea transportation for its key customers in the future. ESL Shipping is investing in twelve new generation electric hybrid vessels  half of which will remain in its own ownership and half will be transferred to the other party of the pooling arrangement. The investment is instrumental in the company’s green transition.During the past 12 months  emission intensity has kept improving and stood at 0.32 (0.33 for the full-year 2022)  driven by net sales growth in combination with operational efficiency and new operating models. The emission intensity target for the full-year 2023 is 0.36.Another key target is employee safety. The Total Recordable Injury Frequency (TRIF) has been developing favorably in the past quarters and was 8.8 (8.1 for the full-year 2022) for the past 12 months. The TRIF target for 2023 is 7.0.Operating environment and the impact of Russia’s invasion in Ukraine on Aspo’s operationsAspo’s operating environment is more stable compared to 2022 even though turbulence remains. Aspo’s commercial activities in eastern markets have significantly declined since Russia’s invasion in Ukraine and Aspo’s focus has been on full withdrawal from selected eastern markets. Major losses related to the withdrawal from selected eastern markets have been accounted for already in 2022 and only minor valuation adjustments are expected to arise during 2023. The translation differences will be accounted for as part of the sales losses  but it will not impact the total equity.The operating environment in the west has been more stable  however  changes in demand  inflation and rising interest rates have caused pressure on commercial activities  including pricing of products as well as on external financing. Volatile exchange rates also reflect the high inflation  which varies from one area to another causing fluctuations in demand. Aspo continues its business operations in Ukraine despite of the war. The market conditions are  however  demanding with no significant improvement in sight in the short term. Aspo continues to operate selectively in certain Central Asian countries like Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.Rising interest and inflation rates  as well as weaker general economic estimates  have affected consumers’ purchasing behavior  for example  so that consumers have shifted from more expensive to more affordable products. The coronavirus pandemic no longer significantly affects Aspo’s operations.ESL Shipping’s all operations were discontinued in Russia in 2022 and the whole capacity now operates in the western markets. Telko has agreed to sell all shares in its Russian subsidiary to GK Himik  a Russian industrial company. The closing of the deal took place in April. Telko is also in the process of winding-down its operations in Belarus. The sales and exit processes of Leipurin’s companies in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan are ongoing and they are expected to be completed during the first half of 2023. All of these companies are reported in the Non-core businesses segment and classified as discontinued operations.Net sales by market area  continuing operations 1-3/2023 Share 1-3/2022 Share 1-12/2022 Share MEUR % MEUR % MEUR % Finland 47.7 33.7 53.3 41.4 224.4 40.0 Scandinavian countries 41.4 29.2 28.6 22.2 137.6 24.5 Baltic countries 17.0 12.0 15.6 12.1 67.8 12.1 Other European countries 19.4 13.7 23.5 18.2 89.6 16.0 Other countries 16.1 11.3 7.8 6.1 41.3 7.4 Total 141.6 100 128.8 100 560.7 100Following the shift of the strategic focus towards western markets  Aspo has changed the market areas when reporting net sales. The new market areas are: Finland  Scandinavian countries  Baltic countries  Other European countries and Other countries. The acquisition of Kobia has significantly increased the contribution of Scandinavia in Group’s total net sales.Cash flow and financingThe Group’s net cash flow from operating activities in January–March was EUR 12.2 (15.2) million. The cash flows of all businesses were strong during the quarter. The cash flow impact of change in working capital was EUR -0.6 (-0.6) million. The slight increase in working capital originates from the increased accounts receivable  whereas the value of inventories decreased.The free cash flow in January–March was EUR 9.1 (13.8) million. Investments amounted to EUR 1.8 (2.8) million and consisted mainly of the ESL Shipping segment’s Green Coaster advance payments. In addition  the cash flow from investing activities includes EUR 3.7 million cash outflow from the acquisitions of Eltrex and EUR 2.4 million cash inflow from the sale of Kobia’s property in Gothenburg  Sweden.3/2023 3/2022 12/2022 MEUR MEUR MEUR Interest-bearing liabilities  incl. lease liabilities 192.3 202.3 189.2 Cash and cash equivalents 35.6 41.3 33.5 Net interest-bearing debt 156.7 161.0 155.7Net interest-bearing debt was EUR 156.7 (155.7) million and gearing decreased to 106.0% (108.4%). The Group’s equity ratio at the end of the review period was 34.8% (34.7%).Net financial expenses in January–March totaled EUR -1.9 (-1.1) million. The average interest rate of interest-bearing liabilities  excluding lease liabilities  rose strongly and was 3.7% (1.3%) increasing Aspo’s interest expenses. Exchange rate fluctuations increased fx-gains and affected positively the net financial expenses.The Group’s liquidity position remained strong. Cash and cash equivalents stood at EUR 35.6 (33.5) million at the end of the review period  of which cash and cash equivalents related to businesses held for sale were EUR 10.1 (11.8) million. Committed revolving credit facilities  totaling EUR 40 million  were fully unused  as in the comparative period. Aspo’s EUR 80 million commercial paper program also remained fully unused.Short-term risks and uncertainties in business operationsAspo and its subsidiaries are exposed to various risks and uncertainties. The most important risks and Aspo’s actions to mitigate these are summarized and reported to Aspo's Board of Directors through Aspo's Audit Committee.Russia’s invasion of Ukraine causes significant geopolitical uncertainties. It affects the general economic environment  including inflation  energy and raw material prices  interest rates  and consumers’ trust.The ongoing process to withdraw from Russia and other selected eastern markets will change the Group’s structure significantly and will affect the revenue model of Aspo’s businesses in the long term. There are risks that the withdrawal from selected markets cause additional costs or losses  and that funds cannot be transferred from the markets or that the withdrawal is unsuccessful in full or in part. It is also possible that the official approvals required for the withdrawal from the markets are not obtained for example due to changes is legislation or that they are at risk or fail for some other reason. As the money from the disposal of Telko Russia has been received these risks are now limited to Leipurin’s eastern operations.Financial activities and the prevailing geopolitical uncertainties have caused the prices of many raw materials  components and logistics services to rise rapidly. While Aspo may benefit from the price increases temporarily  the prices of raw materials or rental capacity  such as leased vessels  are increasing at the same time. Disruptions in logistics flows  longer delivery times for spare parts  components and raw materials  and any rapid price changes are also increasing risks. The rapid increase in inflation has generally caused pressure for salary increases  which can lead to labor disputes  which can also negatively affect Aspo's businesses.Overall economic development and energy price development cause changes in demand and price volatility of plastic and chemical based raw materials. Subsequently these will impact the financial performance of Telko  who does though benefit from a focus on more technical products  and wide product mix and scalability of operations.Overall economic development and specific demand and production volumes in key industries  such as metal  forest products  and energy  impact the demand of shipping. In this regard  ESL Shipping benefits from long-term industrial partnerships and a general deficit of all year-round vessel capacity in the Baltic Sea area.In line with its strategy  Aspo aims to increase its profit-making ability through acquisitions. Strategy execution may lead to a temporary deterioration in the balance sheet and capital structure in situations where acquisitions require financial resources and consequently may reduce solvency. With its strategy  Aspo aims to reduce the impact of the possibly weakening general economic development on Aspo’s profit-making ability.Because the future estimates presented in this interim report are based on the current situation and knowledge  they involve significant risks and other uncertainties  due to which actual future outcomes may differ from the estimates.ASPO’S BUSINESSESESL ShippingESL Shipping is the leading dry bulk sea transport company operating in the Baltic Sea area. ESL Shipping’s operations are mainly based on long-term customer contracts and established customer relationships. At the end of the review period  the shipping company’s fleet consisted of 42 vessels with a total capacity of 438 000 deadweight tons (dwt). Of these  23 were wholly owned (78% of the tonnage)  two were minority owned (2%) and the remaining 17 vessels (20%) were time chartered.ESL Shipping’s competitive edge is based on its pioneering role and ability to responsibly and energy efficiently secure product and raw material transportation for industries and energy production year-round  even in difficult conditions. The shipping company loads and unloads large ocean liners at sea as a special service.1-3/2023 1-3/2022 Change % Net sales  MEUR 52.7 56.8 -7 Operating profit  MEUR 6.0 9.2 -35 Operating profit  % 11.4 16.2 Items affecting comparability  MEUR 1.3 Comparable operating profit  MEUR 6.0 7.9 -24 Comparable operating profit  % 11.4 13.9In the first quarter  ESL Shipping’s net sales decreased by 7% from the previous year to EUR 52.7 (56.8) million. The comparable operating profit for the quarter decreased by 24% to EUR 6.0 (7.9) million  with the comparable operating profit rate being 11.4% (13.9%). Despite being lower than the record level of the previous year  the reported operating profit for the first quarter of 2023 can still be considered good.The anticipated unrest in Finland’s labor market materialized and the first quarter of 2023 was hampered by stevedore’s overtime ban and two weeks strike in most Finnish ports. As a result  cargo volumes transported by ESL Shipping decreased from the comparative period to 3.3 (3.8) million tons. Typical for a strike situation  the adverse effect to shipping company started approximately two weeks before the informed time of the strike and the traffic was normalized only 2-3 weeks after the strike ended.ESL Shipping’s handysize vessels had stable volume demand from long term partnership industries during the first quarter of 2023. Coaster vessel volumes suffered not only from the strike but also from severe capacity constraints due to limited availability of time charter tonnage and unexpected 35 days maintenance off-hire of two owned sister vessels. This in turn was caused by the inferior quality of machinery spare parts provided by their original equipment maker. For the company’s largest supramax vessels the spot cargo market activity and freight rate levels were significantly lower during the first quarter than during the comparative period.After operations in Russia were suspended one year ago  demand for ESL Shipping’s loading and unloading operations for vessels at sea shifted to the southern Baltic Sea where it was adversely affected by the lower-than-expected demand for energy coal transportation. Overall  continental Europe experienced a mild winter  which resulted in lower-than-expected energy industry shipping volumes. The share of energy coal transported by ESL Shipping returned to a clearly decreasing trend.During the quarter  the prices of diesel and liquefied natural gas (LNG) used as ship fuels continued to decrease from the previous quarter. Price of LNG has decreased to levels seen last time in the autumn of 2021. In historical context fuel prices are still high. The impact of energy price fluctuations on ESL Shipping’s costs is managed through fuel clauses in long-term transportation agreements.The newbuilding project of ESL Shipping’s Swedish subsidiary AtoBatC Shipping AB at the Chowgule & Company Private Limited shipyard in India proceeded as planned during the first quarter. Every other vessel in the series of 12 next-generation electric hybrid vessels will be sold  as announced earlier  to the company established by the pooling investor group. The first five new vessels are already under construction  and the first vessel is to be delivered during fall 2023.The shipping company’s long-term environmental activities focus on minimizing emissions to the sea and air. The aim is to halve carbon dioxide emissions per transportation unit by the end of the decade. During the first quarter of 2023  ESL Shipping’s vessels consumed 189 932 (226 212) MWh of energy. CO2 efficiency improved by 12.5% to 13.6 (15.5) grams of carbon dioxide per transported ton-mile. The new energy-efficient operating models applied to port visits supported the positive development.ESL Shipping outlook for 2023Opinions with regards to global demand estimates in sea transportation markets and price levels of spot markets are split. After a very slow start of the year the market for the larger tonnage has somewhat picked up again since the re-opening of China after Covid-19  but continental Europe  Baltic Sea and Scandinavia still remain as a very low activity market area. On the other hand  the availability of vessel capacity suitable for round-the-year operations in the Baltic Sea is limited and ESL Shipping’s long-term partners in the steel industry have fairly stable  albeit lower than in the previous year  volume expectations for the remaining part of 2023. In the forest industry  pulp delivery volumes are looking less positive than at the beginning of the year and sawn goods demand is only satisfactory  despite the fact that production capacity on the other hand is increasing. The role of energy coal transportation is expected to decrease significantly when the preparation situation returns to normal and demand shifts towards other energy forms. Demand for energy deliveries is expected to pick up only in the second half of the year.The majority of the shipping company’s transportation capacity has been secured through long-term agreements with the exception of the Supramax vessels. The expectations of the lessors of the time-chartered vessels continue not to meet the realities in the shipping company’s main market areas which may cause further uncertainties in the availability and pricing of a suitable and sufficient tonnage.ESL Shipping’s investments in energy-efficient vessels will strengthen its competitiveness and market position in the future. ESL Shipping will continue the development of a completely fossil-free sea transportation ecosystem in line with the green transition and the vessels designed for it in cooperation with its key customers. ESL Shipping is participating in projects aimed to produce green hydrogen through renewable electricity and to further process it into fossil-free fuel for the shipping company’s vessels.During the remaining part of 2023  four larger and two smaller vessels will be docked for a total of approximately 100 days. The larger vessels to be docked this year are the most profitable units in ESL Shipping’s fleet and therefore the result in Q2 and Q3 will be negatively affected.As informed in a separate stock exchange release on 26th April  Aspo‘s Board of Directors has decided to initiate a program to support and accelerate ESL Shipping’s low-carbon growth strategy. The program will assess alternative measures  including the launch of a second wave investment pool  a possible equity injection in ESL Shipping by a minority shareholder  and the sale of ESL Shipping’s two Supramax vessels  m/s Arkadia and m/s Kumpula. The measures are intended to enhance ESL Shipping’s capacity to execute its ESG driven strategy  including investments in new green vessels  to further focus ESL Shipping’s business scope  and improve its financial resilience. Aspo would in all scenarios remain as a committed majority owner of ESL Shipping.TelkoTelko is a leading expert in and supplier of plastic raw materials  industrial chemicals  and lubricants. It operates as a sustainable partner in the value chain  bringing well-known international principals and customers together. Its competitive edge is based on strong technical support  efficient logistics and local expert service. Telko operates in Finland  the Baltic countries  Scandinavia  Poland  Romania  Ukraine  Kazakhstan  Uzbekistan  and China.Operations of Telko’s subsidiaries in Russia and Belarus have been reclassified to Aspo’s new Non-core businesses segment. The financials of these subsidiaries are no longer included in the Telko segment. The comparative figures have been restated according to the new reporting structure.1-3/2023 1-3/2022 Change % Net sales  MEUR 54.3 50.6 7 Operating profit  MEUR 2.7 -2.0 -235 Operating profit  % 5.0 -4.0 Items affecting comparability  MEUR -4.6 Comparable operating profit  MEUR 2.7 2.6 4 Comparable operating profit  % 5.0 5.1In the first quarter of 2023  Telko’s net sales increased to EUR 54.3 (50.6) million and its comparable operating profit grew slightly to EUR 2.7 (2.6) million. Organic growth and the acquisition of Eltrex contributed positively to Telko’s sales growth  whereas the war clearly had a negative sales impact in Ukraine in comparison with the first quarter last year. Telko’s comparable operating profit rate was 5.0% (5.1%). In the comparative period  items affecting comparability amounting to EUR -4.6 million and were related to the destroyed warehouse in Ukraine and a credit loss provision associated with accounts receivable in Ukraine. Telko’s reported operating profit for the first quarter increased to EUR 2.7 (-2.0) million.Net sales of the plastics business decreased by 2% during the first quarter  amounting to EUR 26.6 (27.2) million. Demand in all segments was below average especially towards the end of the quarter when many customers lowered stock levels due to reduced order intake. Prices of volume plastics were mostly stable compared to the previous quarter but still about 15 % lower than in Q1 2022. Engineering plastics prices continued to decrease in general  but some product groups were going in the opposite direction mainly driven by production costs.Net sales of the chemicals business increased by 25% to EUR 15.1 (12.1) million. Demand remained relatively healthy in the main markets. Prices continued to decline in many product lines  but the development was quite balanced. On January 31  Telko acquired Eltrex  a Polish distributor of specialty chemicals and industrial packaging materials. Eltrex contributed EUR 1.4 million to the net sales during the quarter.Net sales of the lubricants business increased by 12% to EUR 12.6 (11.3) million. High demand especially for Industrial lubricants continued and resulted in sales volume growth. In Automotive lubricants demand remained stable. Telko has strengthened its position in Marine Lubricants and sales developed strongly during the quarter. During the first quarter prices of readymade lubricants stabilized after a long period of continuous increases. All prices are clearly above long-term average levels.Telko outlook for 2023Telko has faced significant changes in its business environment during the last year. Russia and Belarus played a significant role in Telko´s former business portfolio. Despite all the changes  the core of Telko´s strategy has remained and will remain the same. As a leading expert serving multiple industries  Telko is in a unique position to create value by improving our customers’ sustainability  productivity  and operational quality. Telko´s growth efforts will be increasingly focused on Europe  but the main components of the company´s value proposition will remain the same.In general  the business outlook in the European market looks somewhat softer than a year ago. Telko serves industrial customers in various industries. The possible changes in demand will be softened by the heterogenic cyclicality of the diversified customer base  and hence Telko’s business remains fairly resilient to changes in overall market development.In plastics  Telko does not anticipate sudden changes in demand during the second quarter. Prices will continue to be on the same or lowering trend due to overall weaker market demand both in volume and engineering plastics. Strict inventory control and careful purchasing will continue in the main customer segments. Customers will continue to lower their buffer inventories as the overall market outlook is softening and there are no more significant availability problems in the market. Prices of freight from Asia to Europe have lowered significantly from the record levels  which encourages increasing imports to the European market.In chemicals  healthy demand is expected to continue in key markets. Price erosion will continue in a controlled manner and some product lines already bottomed. The recently acquired Eltrex will have a positive impact on both sales and profitability.It is expected that for lubricants the demand will remain stable during the first half of the year. No significant price changes are expected during the first half of the year. The possible slower economic development might have an adverse impact on demand for lubricants during the second half of the year. Telko will continue to focus on increasing its market share in high performance lubricants  metal working fluids and marine lubricants.Sales in Ukraine are expected to pick up if the electricity supply situation remains stable. In any case sales in Ukraine during Q2 will be higher than in previous year  but significantly below pre-war levels. Solid growth is expected to continue in Central Asia.The recent acquisitions have proved to be successful  and they have had a positive impact on the existing businesses. Telko will accelerate its growth through acquisitions to achieve set strategic goals in all three business segments. Telko will also seek to strengthen its market share in existing markets through organic growth.In order to secure good profitability  Telko will further strengthen its cost efficiency and continue developing its operating model towards better scalability and flexibility. Good inventory control and capital efficiency will continue to be a high priority for Telko. The asset-light business model of Telko enables better ability to utilize new business opportunities and to react to changes in the business environment.LeipurinLeipurin operates as part of the food chain  acquiring raw materials in global markets and from domestic companies  and supplying them through its effective logistics chain according to customer needs. With operations in six countries including Finland  Sweden  Baltic countries  and Ukraine  Leipurin serves bakery  food industry  and foodservice customers by providing raw materials  supporting research & development  recipes  and innovations for new products. Leipurin also offers various supplies and machines for the same customer segments  partnering with leading international manufacturers for its raw material and machinery supply.Operations of Leipurin subsidiaries in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan have been reclassified to Aspo’s new Non-core businesses segment. The financials of these subsidiaries are no longer included in the Leipurin segment. The comparative figures have been restated according to the new reporting structure.1-3/2023 1-3/2022 Change % Net sales  MEUR 34.6 21.4 62 Operating profit  MEUR 1.2 -0.8 -250 Operating profit  % 3.5 -3.7 Items affecting comparability  MEUR 0.2 -0.9 Comparable operating profit  MEUR 1.0 0.1 900 Comparable operating profit  % 2.9 0.5Leipurin’s net sales increased by 62% during the first quarter to EUR 34.6 (21.4) million. In Finland net sales increased by 14% to EUR 11.9 (10.4) million. In the Baltic countries  net sales increased by 19% to EUR 9.4 (7.9) million. Net sales of the Ukraine business unit decreased by 40% to EUR 0.3 (0.5) million. Sweden was established as a new business unit as a result of the acquisition of Kobia AB on September 1  2022  and it contributed with EUR 13.0 million and approximately 38% of Leipurin’s net sales in the first quarter of 2023. Net sales of Q1 2022 included EUR 2.5 million net sales of the divested Vulganus Oy. During the first quarter  sales to bakeries increased by 80% to EUR 25.7 (14.3) million  driven by the Kobia acquisition. Sales to the food industry increased by 26% to EUR 2.9 (2.3) million.The steep increase in raw material prices in global markets continued to have an impact on Leipurin’s sales during the first quarter. Measured in kilo volume  the decline in sales continued in Finland  Sweden and the Baltic countries. The weak volume development was driven by factors such as consumer price shock resulting from inflation  high energy prices  and higher interest rates  as well as post-Covid-19 effects  where food retail sales declined after a surge during the pandemic  while food service consumption respectively recovered. Leipurin expects this phenomenon to stabilize and normalize during the year 2023  although consumer demand for more affordable products continues to drive market dynamics. In the case of Leipurin  the volume decrease has been predominantly in the low-margin commodity items  resulting in an improved product mix  so the positive development in gross profits continued even at slightly lower total volumes.The comparable operating profit for the first quarter stood at EUR 1.0 (0.1) million  and the comparable operating profit rate was 2.9% (0.5%). Items affecting comparability  totaling EUR 0.2 (-0.9) million  included the gain related to the sale and leaseback of Kobia’s property in Gothenburg. The comparability of the comparative period was affected by the destroyed warehouse in Ukraine and provision for credit losses with Ukrainian customers. Leipurin’s operating profit for the first quarter was EUR 1.2 (-0.8) million.Leipurin completed the sale and leaseback of the property in Gothenburg  Sweden in February 2023. In March  Leipurin also signed a sale and leaseback arrangement of the property in Hässleholm  Sweden  and expects to close this deal during the second quarter. The property in Hässleholm has been classified as assets held for sale in the balance sheet on the reporting date. Leipurin continues the efforts to complete a sale and leaseback transaction also of the properties in Tyresö  Sweden. These actions will release a significant share of the capital that was invested when acquiring Kobia AB.Leipurin outlook for 2023The expansion to Sweden through the acquisition of Kobia AB will contribute to Leipurin’s annual net sales by roughly EUR 50 million and generate considerable synergy benefits in product range development  supply chain  and procurement. It also enables partners to be served in a larger geographic area. The integration of operations and synergy capture have clearly progressed according to plan.Inflation and the rising energy prices  in particular  will have a negative impact on demand for more expensive products  potentially presenting profitability challenges among the bakery segment’s customers. The decreased purchasing power may have a negative impact on demand especially for artisan bakeries  as consumers shift towards more affordable products.The upward trend is expected to continue in the prices of main raw material categories  even though the rapid inflation during the review period is expected to decelerate considerably during this year.Despite these challenges  we see that the market will offer a highly stable environment in the long term and also opportunities for organic growth in selected market segments. With its new setup of Finland  Sweden and the Baltic countries forming the core business area  and being more clearly focused on food ingredient sales  Leipurin is now a more synergistic group. The management structure has been renewed and the operating model revised to drive and develop the business across Leipurin countries in this setup. The impact of Russia’s invasion in Ukraine on the global supply chains  the availability of certain raw materials  general delivery times and especially on market development and demand in Ukraine will continue  but with less effects on Leipurin’s business than last year.Management of payment defaults and claims has succeeded well at present. Profitability challenges will increase the risks of payment defaults and bankruptcies among customers and suppliers.Non-core businessesThe Non-core businesses segment includes Telko Russia and Belarus as well as Kauko GmbH previously reported in the Telko segment  Leipurin Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan previously reported in the Leipurin segment and ESL Shipping Russia previously reported in the ESL Shipping segment. The Non-core businesses segment was established to separate the results of the non-core businesses of Aspo from the results of the continuing businesses. All the entities in the segment are either held for sale or in the process of being closed down.Non-core 1-3/2023 1-3/2022 Change % Net sales  MEUR 5.9 31.6 -81 Operating profit  MEUR -0.1 6.3 -102 Operating profit  % -1.7 19.9 Items affecting comparability  MEUR 0.3 -0.2 Comparable operating profit  MEUR -0.4 6.5 -106 Comparable operating profit  % -6.8 20.6The net sales from the Non-core businesses declined by 81% during the first quarter to EUR 5.9 (31.6) million. The net sales of the Non-core businesses was split between Leipurin EUR 4.3 million and Telko EUR 1.6 million. The comparable operating profit was EUR -0.4 million. The operating profit of the Non-core businesses was EUR -0.1 (6.3) million. The Leipurin entities contributed positively to the comparable operating profit  but the Telko entities caused the negative comparable operating profit of the segment. The operating profit included EUR 0.3 million of items affecting comparability  which were caused by reversal of impairments due to decreased net assets of the eastern businesses held for sale. The net assets of the eastern businesses decreased more than their fair value  which caused the positive effect on the result.On April 19  after receiving the required approvals from the Russian authorities  Telko received the funds for the sale of the share capital of its Russian subsidiary to Russian industrial operator GK Himik. The original sales price was approximately EUR 9.5 million as announced in October 2022. The received sales price was EUR 5.7 million after mandatory valuation adjustments. Considering the already recognized write-downs  the transaction will not generate a material sales loss except for the translation differences which amount to approximately EUR -8.6 million.

After the end of the review period Aspo received payment of EUR 5.7 million for the sale of Telko Russia. According to our understanding and experience  also the sales price of the Leipurin entities classified as held for sale is expected to be received in conjunction with the sale of the entities. However  there is a risk that the Group does not have access to the cash and cash equivalents in full in Russia  which is why they must be considered restricted cash and cash equivalents in accordance with IAS 7.Events after the review periodOn April 19  after receiving the required approvals from the local authorities  Telko completed the sale of its Russian operations to a local industrial operator GK Himik.On April 26  Aspo announced that it is initiating a program to accelerate ESL Shipping’s low-carbon growth strategy. The aim is to assess a selection of alternative measures  including a launch of a new investment pool of green vessels  a possible equity injection in ESL Shipping by a minority shareholder  and the sales of the shipping company’s two Supramax vessels. Based on the program  preferred measures will be launched to enhance ESL Shipping’s capacity to execute its ESG-driven strategy. In all scenarios Aspo will remain a committed majority owner of ESL Shipping.Helsinki  May 3  2023Aspo PlcBoard of DirectorsPress and analyst conferenceA press  analyst and investor conference will be held at FLIK’s Eliel studio in Sanomatalo  Töölönlahdenkatu 2  00100 Helsinki on Wednesday May 3  2023  at 2 p.m. The event is also open to private investors  and participants are requested to register beforehand by emailing viestinta@aspo.com.The interim report will be presented by CEO Rolf Jansson.

The average realized sales price was $4 846/dmt CIF China for the quarter. The average cost per ton for the quarter was $338/dmt CIF China. This exceptional cost per ton result was driven by high sales volumes of tantalum concentrate in the quarter  and drove a quarterly EBITDA figure for AMG Brazil of $92 million.AMG Critical MineralsQ1 ‘23 Q1 ‘22 Change Revenue $62 929 $106 909 (41%) Gross profit 7 266 13 002 (44%) Operating profit 635 5 647 (89%) EBITDA 2 550 7 883 (68%)AMG Critical Minerals’ revenue for the first quarter of 2023 decreased by $44 million  or 41%  to $63 million  mainly due to lower volumes across the segment which was primarily driven by the silicon metal plant care and maintenance plan for the first two months of 2023 prior to restarting and operating one furnace in March discussed in detail below. The segment also suffered from a slowdown in the European industrial economy.Gross profit of $7 million in the first quarter was $6 million lower compared to the first quarter of 2022  largely due to the lower volumes in the first three months of this year.SG&A expenses in the first quarter of 2023 decreased by 3%  to $7 million  compared to the same period in 2022. This was driven by lower personnel costs and variable compensation expense in the current quarter due to the interruptions in AMG Silicon’s operations earlier this quarter.The first quarter 2023 EBITDA decreased 68% compared to the same period in 2022  to $3 million  due to the lower gross profit as noted above.As of March 1  2023  AMG’s silicon metal plant in Pocking  Germany  restarted operating one furnace. AMG Silicon is operating one furnace throughout the second quarter and plans to operate one furnace in the third quarter. The operational parameters of the silicon business will continue to be reviewed on an ongoing basis and will be adjusted as appropriate in line with favorable and predictable market conditions. Due to the noted interruptions in silicon operations  the financial impact of the business will be excluded from EBITDA during this period of abnormal operations. However  AMG Silicon generated $11 million in cash flow from operating activities during the quarter driven by the receipt of energy sales made in the fourth quarter of 2022. The financial impact of the care and maintenance program does not significantly impact AMG’s overall projected 2023 financial results.AMG Critical Materials TechnologiesQ1 ‘23 Q1 ‘22 Change Revenue $168 581 $153 295 10% Gross profit 23 619 23 188 2% Operating profit 3 745 3 948 (5%) EBITDA 9 424 9 650 (2%)AMG Critical Materials Technologies' first quarter 2023 revenue increased by $15 million  or 10%  compared to the same period in 2022. This improvement was driven by higher sales volumes of titanium alloys and chrome metal.SG&A expenses increased by 3% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022  due to an increase in personnel costs and higher variable compensation expense in the current quarter.AMG Critical Materials Technologies’ EBITDA was $9 million during the quarter compared to $10 million in the same period of 2022. The slight decrease was due to lower sequential chrome prices in the first quarter  partially offset by stronger profitability from our Engineering business.AMG Engineering signed $76 million in new orders during the first quarter of 2023  driven by strong orders of remelting  turbine blade and heat treatment furnaces  representing a 1.21x book to bill ratio. Order backlog was $237 million as of March 31  2023  the highest since March 31  2020.Financial ReviewTaxAMG recorded an income tax expense of $36 million in the first quarter of 2023  compared to a tax benefit of $1 million in the first quarter of 2022. This variance was mainly driven by higher profitability in AMG Lithium at its Brazil operation coupled with movements in the Brazilian real. The effects of the Brazilian real caused a $2 million tax expense in the first three months of 2023  compared to a $15 million benefit in the same period in 2022. Fluctuations in the Brazilian real exchange rate impact the valuation of the Company’s net deferred tax positions related to our operations in Brazil.AMG paid taxes of $21 million in the first quarter of 2023  compared to tax payments of $4 million in the first quarter of 2022. The higher cash payments this quarter were largely a result of higher profitability in Brazil.Exceptional ItemsAMG’s first quarter 2023 gross profit includes exceptional items  which are not included in the calculation of EBITDA.A summary of exceptional items included in gross profit in the first quarters of 2023 and 2022 are below:Exceptional items included in gross profitQ1 ‘23 Q1 ‘22 Change Gross profit $139 842 $75 194 86% Inventory cost adjustment 510 — N/A Restructuring (reversal) expense (263) 141 N/A Asset impairment reversal (767) — N/A Silicon’s partial closure (156) — N/A Strategic project (reversal) expense (51) 2 265 N/A Gross profit excluding exceptional items 139 115 77 600 79%The asset impairment reversal during the first quarter of 2023 was due to an insurance recovery on previously impaired machinery and equipment.SG&AAMG’s first quarter 2023 SG&A expenses were $40 million compared to $37 million in the first quarter of 2022  with the increase largely attributable to higher personnel costs and variable compensation expense mainly driven by the increase in headcount related to the lithium and vanadium expansion projects in our Clean Energy Materials segment.LiquidityMarch 31  2023 December 31  2022 Change Senior secured debt $339 061 $348 622 (3%) Cash & cash equivalents 359 525 346 043 4% Senior secured net (cash) debt (20 464) 2 579 N/A Other debt 14 801 14 959 (1%) Net (cash) debt excluding municipal bond (5 663) 17 538 N/A Municipal bond debt 319 185 319 244 —% Restricted cash 2 911 6 920 (58%) Net debt 310 611 329 862 (6%)AMG ended the quarter in a $311 million net debt position. This decrease versus year-end 2022 was mainly due to $10 million of debt repayment and higher unrestricted cash of $14 million  offset by the utilization of restricted cash associated with the municipal bond.AMG continued to maintain a strong balance sheet and adequate sources of liquidity during the first quarter. As of March 31  2023  the Company had $360 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and $195 million available on its revolving credit facility. As such  AMG had $555 million of total liquidity as of March 31  2023.Net Finance CostsAMG’s first quarter 2023 net finance cost was $7 million compared to $9 million in the first quarter of 2022. This variance was mainly driven by foreign exchange gains of $2 million during the quarter primarily due to non-cash intergroup balances.AMG capitalized $2 million of interest costs in the first quarter of 2023 versus $4 million in the same period in 2022. This decrease is mainly driven by the interest associated with the expansion projects in AMG Lithium and Brazil operations compared to a higher capitalized interest associated with the Company's tax-exempt municipal bond supporting the vanadium expansion in Ohio in prior year.OutlookAMG reaffirms its guidance for the full year 2023 to exceed $400 million EBITDA.Regarding AMG's 5-year guidance  the outstanding progress we have made with our strategic growth projects and given the compelling long-term supply and demand dynamics in the lithium market  we are issuing new guidance to achieve $650 million EBITDA  or more  in 5 years or earlier.Profit for the period to adjusted EBITDA reconciliationQ1 ‘23 Q1 ‘22 Profit for the period $56 447 $29 884 Income tax expense (benefit) 35 927 (1 489) Net finance cost 6 617 8 919 Equity-settled share-based payment transactions 1 469 1 380 Restructuring (reversal) expense (263) 141 Silicon’s partial closure 547 — Inventory cost adjustment 510 — Asset impairment reversal (767) — Strategic project expense (1) 3 625 4 796 Share of loss of associates 1 032 500 Others — 102 EBIT 105 144 44 233 Depreciation and amortization 12 967 10 527 EBITDA 118 111 54 760Notes:(1) The Company is in the initial development and ramp-up phases for several strategic expansion projects  including AMG Vanadium’s expansion project  the joint venture with Shell  Hybrid Lithium Vanadium Redox Flow Battery System  and the lithium expansion in Germany  which incurred project expenses during the quarter but are not yet operational.

It is based on the NASDAQ ESG Reporting Guide 2.0 and Euronext Guidelines to issuers for ESG reporting.

Kalleklev  Chief Executive Officer of Flex LNG Management AS  commented:“We are pleased to publish our fifth edition of the annual ESG report. ESG is an integral part of our business strategy and we will continue to broaden the scope of our initiatives and our ESG reporting. In 2022 we broadened the reporting scope with also reporting under the Climate Disclosure Project (“CDP”) where the score of B- was released in December last year. Further in 2022 we established a ESG committee and incorporated ESG as part of the executive pay considerations. Our business strategy is to transport LNG  which is primarily utilized to replace coal and to some extent diesel in power generation  in the safest way with as little impact on the environment as possible. Replacing coal with natural gas cuts CO2 emissions by about half  but also cleans up the local environment due to the clean burning properties of natural gas.”Story continuesFor further queries  please contact:Øystein M.

Recurring revenues (82%) up 7% organically; non-recurring revenues up 2% organically. Digital & services revenues (94%) grew 7% organically; print revenues declined 5% organically. Expert solutions revenues (58%) grew 7% organically.First-quarter adjusted operating profit margin decreased 270 basis points. Personnel costs and personnel-related expenses increased  as expected.First-quarter adjusted free cash flow decreased 23% in constant currencies  mainly due to lower working capital inflows related to timing of payments.Net debt-to-EBITDA was 1.3x as of March 31  2023.Progress on 2023 share buyback: €303 million of intended share buyback of up to €1 billion completed in the year through May 1  2023.Nancy McKinstry  CEO and Chair of the Executive Board  commented: “We have seen a good start to the year  with performance broadly as expected. Product investment has been sustained at high levels as we continue to pursue opportunities for organic growth while enhancing our solutions for customers. The creation of a fifth division  Corporate Performance & ESG  was implemented in March and our teams around the world are focused on executing on our strategy. We are confident in reiterating our guidance for full-year 2023.”First - q uarter 202 3 d evelopmentsFirst-quarter revenues increased 5% in constant currencies  reflecting organic growth of 6% (1Q 2022: 8%)  partly offset by the impact of net divestitures. In the first quarter  the average EUR/USD rate was favorable (averaging 1.07 in 1Q 2023 versus 1.12 in 1Q 2022). Recurring revenues (82% of revenues)  which include subscriptions and other repeating revenue streams  increased 7% organically (1Q 2022: 8%). Non-recurring revenues (18% of revenues) rose 2% organically  marking an expected slowdown from a year ago (1Q 2022: 9%). Of non-recurring revenues  Governance  Risk & Compliance transactional revenues declined 1% organically (1Q 2022: 1% increase). Print book trends were mixed. Other non-recurring revenues  mainly comprised of on-premise software licenses and implementation fees  rose 2% organically against a tough comparable (1Q 2022: 14% organic growth). The adjusted operating profit margin declined 270 basis points in the first quarter  reflecting the expected increase in personnel costs and personnel-related expenses such as office and travel costs.Story continuesIn March  we implemented the new five-division structure announced on February 22  2023. The discussion below still follows the previous four-division reporting structure. Pro forma historical figures for the five divisions will be provided in advance of our half-year 2023 report.Health revenues grew 5% organically (1Q 2022: 9%). Clinical Solutions grew 6% organically (1Q 2022: 9%)  led by our clinical decision support solution  UpToDate  and patient engagement solution  Emmi. Clinical drug information revenues returned to mid-single digit organic growth. Learning  Research & Practice grew 3% organically against a challenging comparable (1Q 2022: 9%). Digital subscription revenues for medical research and nursing solutions grew 4% organically  while print books  journal advertising  and other non-recurring revenues declined.Tax & Accounting revenues grew 11% organically (1Q 2022: 9%). Our North American professional Tax & Accounting business sustained double-digit organic growth  mainly driven by cloud software  including the CCH Axcess suite. The North American business benefitted from continued strength of outsourced professional services and a favorable print book publishing schedule. Professional Tax & Accounting in Europe and Asia Pacific both recorded a strong start to the year. Our Corporate Performance unit  comprising CCH Tagetik and U.S. Corporate Tax  recorded accelerated double-digit organic growth  supported by strong performance in cloud software and services across all major global regions.Governance  Risk & Compliance revenues were flat on an organic basis against a tough comparable (1Q 2022: 8%)  largely as expected. A 6% decline in non-recurring revenues (37% of division revenues) was offset by 4% organic growth in recurring revenues. In Legal Services  organic growth was 2% (1Q 2022: 7%)  as solid growth in recurring subscriptions was partly offset by a 2% organic decline in Legal Services transactional revenues. In Financial Services  organic revenues declined 3% (1Q 2022: organic growth of 8%)  as momentum in recurring revenues slowed and non-recurring revenues declined. Lien Solutions and mortgage transaction volumes declined while on-premise software license and implementation fees were lower than a year ago.Legal & Regulatory revenues grew 7% organically (1Q 2022: 6%). Legal & Regulatory Information Solutions (74% of divisional revenues) delivered stable 3% organic growth (1Q 2022: 3%)  as digital and services subscriptions increased 8% organically (1Q 2022: 7%)  more than compensating for a decline in training and other non-recurring products. The Enablon EHS/ORM1 platform delivered double-digit organic growth in both recurring cloud subscriptions and non-recurring software license fees in the quarter. In constant currencies  divisional revenues declined 3% due to the divestment on November 30  2022  of legal publishing assets in France and Spain.Cash flow and net debtFirst-quarter adjusted free cash flow declined 23% in constant currencies  due to lower working capital inflow in the quarter as a result of timing of payments. In addition  capital expenditure increased due to investments in innovation. Paid financing cost and paid tax were lower than a year ago. Net cash spend on acquisitions was €24 million  mainly related to the acquisition of NurseTim on January 9  2023. A total of €230 million in cash was deployed towards share repurchases during the quarter.As of March 31  2023  net debt was €2 227 million  compared to €2 253 million at December 31  2022. Net-debt-to-EBITDA  based on rolling twelve-month EBITDA  was 1.3x at the end of March 2023  compared to 1.3x at year-end 2022. As of March 31  2023  the number of issued ordinary shares outstanding (excluding 10.5 million shares held in treasury) was 247.0 million.In early April  we issued a new €700 million Eurobond with an 8-year term and 3.750% annual coupon.Dividends and s hare b uybacksIn the year to date (through May 1)  Wolters Kluwer has repurchased 2.8 million ordinary shares for a total consideration of €303 million (average share price €109.22). This includes a block trade of €43.5 million executed on February 23  2023  to offset the dilution caused by our incentive share issuance.For the period starting May 4  2023  up to and including July 31  2023  we have engaged a third party to execute €200 million in share buybacks on our behalf  within the limits of relevant laws and regulations (in particular Regulation (EU) 596/2014) and Wolters Kluwer’s Articles of Association. Share repurchases will be used for capital reduction purposes and to meet obligations arising from share-based incentive plans.At the Annual General Meeting to be held on May 10  2023  shareholders will be asked to approve a total dividend of €1.81 over financial year 2022  an increase of 15% compared to the 2021 dividend. If approved  the final dividend of €1.18 per share will be paid to shareholders on June 6  2023 (ADRs: June 13  2023). The interim dividend for 2023 will be set at 40% of the 2022 total dividend.ESG d evelopmentsIn the first quarter  we made progress in advancing our ESG performance. In the area of human capital  we continued efforts to attract and retain talent and to support employee engagement and belonging. A range of initiatives around training and career development are planned for 2023. Efforts to reduce our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions continued  with our global real estate team on track to deliver a further reduction in absolute square meters of office space in 2023. Our program of decommissioning on-premise servers continued as we migrated applications and customers to energy-efficient cloud platforms. As reported previously  in early 2023  we submitted near-term targets to the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) for validation  to reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 50% and absolute Scope 3 GHG emissions by 30% by the year 2030 from a 2019 base year. We are continuing our review of the new EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) in preparation for its application in 2024.Full- y ear 202 3 o utlookOur guidance for 2023 is provided below. We continue to expect full-year organic growth to be in line with the prior year and the adjusted operating profit margin to improve. We continue to expect first half 2023 organic growth to be slower compared to the prior year period  most notably in Governance  Risk & Compliance and Health. We continue to expect the adjusted operating margin to decline in the first half before improving in the second half.Full-year 2023 outlook Performance indicators 2023 Guidance 2022 Actual Adjusted operating profit margin* 26.1%-26.5% 26.1% Adjusted free cash flow** Around €1 200 million €1 220 million ROIC* 16.5%-17.0% 15.5% Diluted adjusted EPS growth** High-single-digit 8% *Guidance for adjusted operating profit margin and ROIC is in reporting currency and assumes an average EUR/USD rate in 2023 of €/$1.07. **Guidance for adjusted free cash flow and diluted adjusted EPS is in constant currencies (€/$ 1.05). Guidance reflects share repurchases of €1 billion in 2023.If the current U.S. dollar rate persists  currency will have a slightly negative effect on full-year 2023 results reported in euros. In 2022  Wolters Kluwer generated over 60% of revenues and adjusted operating profit in North America. As a rule of thumb  based on our 2022 currency profile  each 1 U.S. cent move in the average €/$ exchange rate for the year causes an opposite change of approximately 3 euro cents in diluted adjusted EPS2.We include restructuring costs in adjusted operating profit. We expect 2023 restructuring costs to be in the range of €10-€15 million (FY 2022: €6 million).We expect adjusted net financing costs3 in constant currencies to be approximately €40 million. We expect the benchmark tax rate on adjusted pre-tax profits to be in the range of 23.0%-24.0% (FY 2022: 22.6%).Capital expenditure is expected to increase but to remain within our normal range of 5.0%-6.0% of total revenues (FY 2022: 5.4%). We expect full-year cash conversion ratio to be approximately 100% (FY 2022: 107%).Our guidance assumes no additional significant change to the scope of operations. We may make further acquisitions or disposals which can be dilutive to margins  earnings  and ROIC in the near term.The impact of discontinuing activities in Russia and Belarus is expected to be immaterial to the consolidated financial results in 2023.2023 Outlook by divisionHealth: we expect full-year organic growth to be in line with prior year and the full-year adjusted operating profit margin to be stable.Tax & Accounting: we expect full-year organic growth to be in line with prior year and the full-year adjusted operating profit margin to be stable.Governance  Risk & Compliance: we expect full-year organic growth to be in line with prior year and the full-year adjusted operating profit margin to improve modestly.Legal & Regulatory: we expect full-year organic growth to be in line with prior year and full-year adjusted operating profit margin to improve modestly.About Wolters KluwerWolters Kluwer (EURONEXT: WKL) is a global leader in information  software solutions and services for professionals in healthcare; tax and accounting; financial and corporate compliance; legal and regulatory; corporate performance and ESG.

Almost a quarter of travelers (24%) now say they're branching out and trying new channels to contact the airlines  and a quarter (26%) report using more self-help options to get the support1.These findings derive from the Teleperformance Business Insights Lab Survey  in which 87 000 consumer interviews were conducted across 20 sectors and 16 countries. Now in its ninth year  the survey queried consumers across topics ranging from customer service channel preferences and metrics  including more than 4 800 airline customers1. The Business Insights Lab looked into travelers' use of airline support channels and their preferences to help airlines understand how travelers want to be served and what channels airlines should consider adding to their contact options.Digital Support Channels Are Getting BusierContacting airlines for help through an airline's mobile app rose 29% since 2019. Instant messaging with airlines' customer service was up 71% since before the pandemic  and texting airlines grew 105%. Travelers told Teleperformance they are also using other ways to seek help from airlines including automated chat and video. These trends are more pronounced across younger demographics. Read additional findings from the survey here.""One of the most significant changes in the travel industry since the pandemic is the growing demand for flexibility among travelers. This includes a demand for more diverse contact options and travelers' rising preference for digital channels that provide flexibility in how they receive help and support "" said Rahul Jolly  President of Global Travel and Hospitality  Teleperformance. ""Building out and enhancing support capabilities across emerging digital channels can help airlines differentiate themselves  provide positive experiences and help customer retention.""1Online survey conducted of 4 803 airline customers across 16 countries between August and September 2022. Survey participants booked their flights and completed travel within the 12-month period preceding the survey date.

At the same time  we made progress with our 2023 priorities  such as continued price discipline and effective COGS management  which resulted in an improvement in our gross margin. The Adjusted EBITA margin performance of our Conventional Products division returned to historical levels. The company’s free cash flow further recovered  driven by working capital improvements. While our adjusted EBITA margin was impacted by lower fixed cost absorption  we remain steadfastly focused on applying our customary cost discipline ” said Eric Rondolat  CEO of Signify.“While we expect the remainder of H1 2023 to remain challenging  we continue to see the potential for an improved second half. Given the structural improvements in our gross margin and free cash flow generation  as well as our intensified measures to reduce fixed costs  we confirm our guidance for the full year.”Brighter Lives  Better World 2025In the first quarter of the year  Signify was on track for all of its Brighter Lives  Better World 2025 sustainability program commitments that contribute to doubling its positive impact on the environment and society.Story continuesDouble the pace of the Paris Agreement:Cumulative carbon reduction over the value chain is on track. This is mainly driven by energy-efficient and connected LED lighting  which drive emission reductions in the use phase.Double our Circular revenues to 32%:Circular revenues were 29%  stable versus the previous quarter  yet on track to reach the 2025 target. Circular revenues continue to be driven by serviceable and circular luminaires.Double our Brighter lives revenues to 32%:Brighter lives revenues were 27%  on track to reach the 2025 target. The main contribution continues to be the consumer well-being and Safety & security portfolios.Double the percentage of women in leadership positions to 34%:The percentage of women in leadership positions was 29%  an increase versus the previous quarter and on track to reach the 2025 target. The improvement was mainly driven by new external hires and the internal promotion of women.OutlookSignify confirms its guidance for 2023. The company continues to focus its efforts on improving the Adjusted EBITA margin and free cash flow. Signify expects for 2023:An Adjusted EBITA margin in the range of 10.5-11.5%Free cash flow between 6-8% of salesFinancial reviewFirst quarter in millions of EUR  except percentages 2022 2023 change Comparable sales growth (9.1%) Effects of currency movements 0.9% Consolidation and other changes 2.1% Sales 1 788 1 678 (6.1%) Adjusted gross margin 684 659 (3.6%) Adj. gross margin (as % of sales) 38.3 % 39.3 % Adj.

Comparable sales declined by 9.1%  driven by continued weakness in the indoor professional business  the consumer segment and the OEM channel. In China  the market was still impacted by COVID-related disruptions  but the company started to see increased economic activity following the reopening.The Adjusted gross margin increased by 100 bps to 39.3%  mainly driven by continued price discipline and effective COGS management. Adjusted indirect costs as a percentage of sales increased by 240 bps to 31.9%  as the reduction of indirect costs was not sufficient to compensate lower sales.Adjusted EBITA decreased to EUR 149 million. The Adjusted EBITA margin decreased by 160 bps to 8.9%  mainly due to under-absorption of fixed costs and an adverse currency effect from the weakening of emerging market currencies  the strengthening of the US Dollar  and a one-off impact from the implementation of a new hedging policy.Restructuring costs were EUR 47 million and were mainly related to Conventional Products. These restructuring costs were in line with the strategy to adjust Conventional Products' footprint to declining sales. Acquisition-related charges were EUR 3 million and incidental items were EUR 16 million  mainly related to additions to environmental provisions.Net income decreased to EUR 28 million  mainly due to lower income from operations and higher financial expenses  partly offset by lower income tax expense due to lower taxable income and a release of tax liabilities. The higher financial expenses were mainly related to a non-cash fair value adjustment of the Virtual Power Purchase Agreements due to lower energy prices  and higher interest costs.The number of employees (FTE) decreased from 36 884 at the end of Q1 22 to 34 408 at the end of Q1 23. The year-on-year decrease is mostly related to a reduction of factory personnel due to lower production volumes. In general  the number of FTEs is affected by fluctuations in volume and seasonality.¹ This press release contains certain non-IFRS financial measures and ratios  such as comparable sales growth  EBITA  adjusted EBITA and free cash flow  and related ratios  which are not recognized measures of financial performance or liquidity under IFRS.

We thereby confirm our guidance for 2023 to exceed $400 million in EBITDA.”Strategic HighlightsLithiumThe lithium concentrate production expansion project in AMG Brazil is progressing as planned.AMG Lithium’s hydroxide refinery in Bitterfeld  Germany  Europe’s first  is under construction  with commissioning for the first 20 000-ton module expected in the fourth quarter of 2023.Regarding its development of solid state battery materials  AMG Lithium GmbH has engaged in a joint production with Fraunhofer Institute  Münster University  Wacker  and Schunk to develop next generation solid-state batteries based on lithium-sulfur technology. AMG Lithium will provide lithium sulfide and solid electrolytes for this project.AMG has a 25% shareholding in Zinnwald Lithium PLC and is supporting the Zinnwald Board to accelerate the development of its lithium project in Eastern Germany.VanadiumThe new vanadium spent catalyst recycling facility in Zanesville  Ohio  continues to progress  with the roaster operating at its design capacity and the melt shop targeting full production capacity later in the second quarter of this year.AMG’s innovative lithium vanadium battery (“LIVA”) projects for industrial power management applications outlined at our Capital Markets Day are being executed as planned.AMG has completed the expansion of its vanadium oxide (“V 2 O 5 ”) production in Nuremberg  either using gasification ash or spent catalyst as alternative feed. V 2 O 5 is increasingly destined for the LIVA battery market.O ”) production in Nuremberg  either using gasification ash or spent catalyst as alternative feed. V O is increasingly destined for the LIVA battery market. In January 2023  AMG started building a vanadium electrolyte plant at its subsidiary  AMG Titanium  in Nuremberg  Germany. The target capacity is 6 000 m³ vanadium electrolyte  which will serve the electricity storage market. Production is expected to start at the end of this year.Shell & AMG Recycling B.V. (“SARBV”) continues to advance its projects in the Middle East including the first phase of the Supercenter project based on long-term supply agreements with ARAMCO. Front end engineering design for the first phase of the project  the conversion of gasification ash into V 2 O 5   began in late 2022 and will be completed in the fourth quarter of 2023.Financial HighlightsRevenue increased by 12% to $451 million in the first quarter of 2023 from $404 million in the first quarter of 2022.EBITDA was $118 million in the first quarter of 2023  up 116% versus the first quarter 2022 EBITDA of $55 million.Annualized return on capital employed was 37.9% for the first quarter of 2023  compared to 19.8% for the first three months of 2022.Cash from operating activities was $93 million in the first quarter of 2023  an increase of $97 million over the same period in 2022.Net income attributable to shareholders for the first three months of 2023 was $56 million  yielding $1.72 diluted earnings per share compared to $0.89 for the same period in 2022.AMG’s liquidity as of March 31  2023 was $555 million  with $360 million of unrestricted cash and $195 million of revolving credit availability.The Company will pay its final 2022 declared dividend of €0.40 per ordinary share on or around May 11  2023  to shareholders of record on May 9  2023.Key FiguresIn 000’s US dollars Q1 ‘23 Q1 ‘22 Change Revenue $450 590 $403 863 12% Gross profit 139 842 75 194 86% Gross margin 31.0% 18.6% Operating profit 100 023 37 814 165% Operating margin 22.2% 9.4% Net income attributable to shareholders 56 221 29 115 93% EPS - Fully diluted 1.72 0.89 93% EBIT (1) 105 144 44 233 138% EBITDA (2) 118 111 54 760 116% EBITDA margin 26.2% 13.6% Cash from (used in) operating activities 93 395 (3 654) N/ANotes:(1) EBIT is defined as earnings before interest and income taxes.

The average realized sales price was $4 846/dmt CIF China for the quarter. The average cost per ton for the quarter was $338/dmt CIF China. This exceptional cost per ton result was driven by high sales volumes of tantalum concentrate in the quarter  and drove a quarterly EBITDA figure for AMG Brazil of $92 million.AMG Critical MineralsQ1 ‘23 Q1 ‘22 Change Revenue $62 929 $106 909 (41%) Gross profit 7 266 13 002 (44%) Operating profit 635 5 647 (89%) EBITDA 2 550 7 883 (68%)AMG Critical Minerals’ revenue for the first quarter of 2023 decreased by $44 million  or 41%  to $63 million  mainly due to lower volumes across the segment which was primarily driven by the silicon metal plant care and maintenance plan for the first two months of 2023 prior to restarting and operating one furnace in March discussed in detail below. The segment also suffered from a slowdown in the European industrial economy.Gross profit of $7 million in the first quarter was $6 million lower compared to the first quarter of 2022  largely due to the lower volumes in the first three months of this year.SG&A expenses in the first quarter of 2023 decreased by 3%  to $7 million  compared to the same period in 2022. This was driven by lower personnel costs and variable compensation expense in the current quarter due to the interruptions in AMG Silicon’s operations earlier this quarter.The first quarter 2023 EBITDA decreased 68% compared to the same period in 2022  to $3 million  due to the lower gross profit as noted above.As of March 1  2023  AMG’s silicon metal plant in Pocking  Germany  restarted operating one furnace. AMG Silicon is operating one furnace throughout the second quarter and plans to operate one furnace in the third quarter. The operational parameters of the silicon business will continue to be reviewed on an ongoing basis and will be adjusted as appropriate in line with favorable and predictable market conditions. Due to the noted interruptions in silicon operations  the financial impact of the business will be excluded from EBITDA during this period of abnormal operations. However  AMG Silicon generated $11 million in cash flow from operating activities during the quarter driven by the receipt of energy sales made in the fourth quarter of 2022. The financial impact of the care and maintenance program does not significantly impact AMG’s overall projected 2023 financial results.AMG Critical Materials TechnologiesQ1 ‘23 Q1 ‘22 Change Revenue $168 581 $153 295 10% Gross profit 23 619 23 188 2% Operating profit 3 745 3 948 (5%) EBITDA 9 424 9 650 (2%)AMG Critical Materials Technologies' first quarter 2023 revenue increased by $15 million  or 10%  compared to the same period in 2022. This improvement was driven by higher sales volumes of titanium alloys and chrome metal.SG&A expenses increased by 3% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022  due to an increase in personnel costs and higher variable compensation expense in the current quarter.AMG Critical Materials Technologies’ EBITDA was $9 million during the quarter compared to $10 million in the same period of 2022. The slight decrease was due to lower sequential chrome prices in the first quarter  partially offset by stronger profitability from our Engineering business.AMG Engineering signed $76 million in new orders during the first quarter of 2023  driven by strong orders of remelting  turbine blade and heat treatment furnaces  representing a 1.21x book to bill ratio. Order backlog was $237 million as of March 31  2023  the highest since March 31  2020.Financial ReviewTaxAMG recorded an income tax expense of $36 million in the first quarter of 2023  compared to a tax benefit of $1 million in the first quarter of 2022. This variance was mainly driven by higher profitability in AMG Lithium at its Brazil operation coupled with movements in the Brazilian real. The effects of the Brazilian real caused a $2 million tax expense in the first three months of 2023  compared to a $15 million benefit in the same period in 2022. Fluctuations in the Brazilian real exchange rate impact the valuation of the Company’s net deferred tax positions related to our operations in Brazil.AMG paid taxes of $21 million in the first quarter of 2023  compared to tax payments of $4 million in the first quarter of 2022. The higher cash payments this quarter were largely a result of higher profitability in Brazil.Exceptional ItemsAMG’s first quarter 2023 gross profit includes exceptional items  which are not included in the calculation of EBITDA.A summary of exceptional items included in gross profit in the first quarters of 2023 and 2022 are below:Exceptional items included in gross profitQ1 ‘23 Q1 ‘22 Change Gross profit $139 842 $75 194 86% Inventory cost adjustment 510 — N/A Restructuring (reversal) expense (263) 141 N/A Asset impairment reversal (767) — N/A Silicon’s partial closure (156) — N/A Strategic project (reversal) expense (51) 2 265 N/A Gross profit excluding exceptional items 139 115 77 600 79%The asset impairment reversal during the first quarter of 2023 was due to an insurance recovery on previously impaired machinery and equipment.SG&AAMG’s first quarter 2023 SG&A expenses were $40 million compared to $37 million in the first quarter of 2022  with the increase largely attributable to higher personnel costs and variable compensation expense mainly driven by the increase in headcount related to the lithium and vanadium expansion projects in our Clean Energy Materials segment.LiquidityMarch 31  2023 December 31  2022 Change Senior secured debt $339 061 $348 622 (3%) Cash & cash equivalents 359 525 346 043 4% Senior secured net (cash) debt (20 464) 2 579 N/A Other debt 14 801 14 959 (1%) Net (cash) debt excluding municipal bond (5 663) 17 538 N/A Municipal bond debt 319 185 319 244 —% Restricted cash 2 911 6 920 (58%) Net debt 310 611 329 862 (6%)AMG ended the quarter in a $311 million net debt position. This decrease versus year-end 2022 was mainly due to $10 million of debt repayment and higher unrestricted cash of $14 million  offset by the utilization of restricted cash associated with the municipal bond.AMG continued to maintain a strong balance sheet and adequate sources of liquidity during the first quarter. As of March 31  2023  the Company had $360 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and $195 million available on its revolving credit facility. As such  AMG had $555 million of total liquidity as of March 31  2023.Net Finance CostsAMG’s first quarter 2023 net finance cost was $7 million compared to $9 million in the first quarter of 2022. This variance was mainly driven by foreign exchange gains of $2 million during the quarter primarily due to non-cash intergroup balances.AMG capitalized $2 million of interest costs in the first quarter of 2023 versus $4 million in the same period in 2022. This decrease is mainly driven by the interest associated with the expansion projects in AMG Lithium and Brazil operations compared to a higher capitalized interest associated with the Company's tax-exempt municipal bond supporting the vanadium expansion in Ohio in prior year.OutlookAMG reaffirms its guidance for the full year 2023 to exceed $400 million EBITDA.Regarding AMG's 5-year guidance  the outstanding progress we have made with our strategic growth projects and given the compelling long-term supply and demand dynamics in the lithium market  we are issuing new guidance to achieve $650 million EBITDA  or more  in 5 years or earlier.Profit for the period to adjusted EBITDA reconciliationQ1 ‘23 Q1 ‘22 Profit for the period $56 447 $29 884 Income tax expense (benefit) 35 927 (1 489) Net finance cost 6 617 8 919 Equity-settled share-based payment transactions 1 469 1 380 Restructuring (reversal) expense (263) 141 Silicon’s partial closure 547 — Inventory cost adjustment 510 — Asset impairment reversal (767) — Strategic project expense (1) 3 625 4 796 Share of loss of associates 1 032 500 Others — 102 EBIT 105 144 44 233 Depreciation and amortization 12 967 10 527 EBITDA 118 111 54 760Notes:(1) The Company is in the initial development and ramp-up phases for several strategic expansion projects  including AMG Vanadium’s expansion project  the joint venture with Shell  Hybrid Lithium Vanadium Redox Flow Battery System  and the lithium expansion in Germany  which incurred project expenses during the quarter but are not yet operational.

Exploiting the powerful greyscale capability of inkjet  Meteor's patented ShellPro™ technology offers step-function savings in the energy and materials required to create complex 3D structures through binder jetting. Meteor is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hybrid Software Group PLC (Euronext: HYSG)  a leading developer of technology solutions at the heart of industrial printing.Binder jet 3D printing often requires the use of multiple structural constituents with different material densities  one structure of which can be a shell forming the external surface of an object. For strength  this outer shell is typically made up of higher density material than that used in the interior of the object. Meteor's patented ShellPro technology takes the pain out of creating this shell through a novel technique that capitalises on the multiple drop size capability of greyscale industrial inkjet printheads. Additionally  ShellPro can automatically reduce shell thickness for small features on a printed object resulting in improved dimensional accuracy. ShellPro is included as a standard feature in Meteor's Met3D software. Met3D provides a straightforward method to convert 3D CAD files such as STL or OBJ to rasterised vector files that inkjet printers can understand.Ken Hillier  Meteor's Director of North America and the patent's primary inventor  explains  ""This innovation offers the potential for additive manufacturing print systems to use as much as 50% less binder fluid  reduce the energy needed for curing and create 3D objects faster  all without sacrificing quality."" Clive Ayling  Meteor's Managing Director  adds  ""Meteor continues to undertake basic research to find and develop ways to improve the functionality  cost  quality and reliability of the industrial inkjet printing process. We are delighted that this invention has been recognised with a US patent and are confident that our ongoing investment in technological innovation will directly benefit not only our OEM customers but also the industry.""About Meteor InkjetHeadquartered in Cambridge UK  Meteor Inkjet Ltd (www.meteorinkjet.com) is the world's leading independent supplier of industrial inkjet electronics  software  tools and services.

This enables the Company to initiate its randomized controlled Phase 1/2a MOJAVE study in the US  in Q2 2023 as planned.Oliver Gödje  Chief Medical Officer of Sequana Medical  commented: ""We are delighted to obtain clearance of the IND for our DSR 2.0 product and are ready to commence the MOJAVE study in US patients with congestive heart failure in a timely manner. We are now focused on enrolling our first patient  which we expect will occur in the second quarter of 2023  and look forward to reporting data from the three patients of the non-randomized cohort by year-end.""Ian Crosbie  Chief Executive Officer of Sequana Medical  added: ""For the estimated 200 000 diuretic-resistant congestive heart failure patients in the US  there is an urgent need for new therapies that can safely and effectively eliminate congestion  reduce repeated hospitalization and improve clinical outcomes. Following the strong safety and efficacy data reported from our RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies  we believe that our DSR therapy has the potential to be a disease-modifying heart failure therapy.""On track to start MOJAVE in Q2 2023MOJAVE is a randomized controlled Phase 1/2a study in the US  designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of DSR 2.0 in diuretic-resistant chronic heart failure patients with persistent congestion.Following Ethics Committee approval  the study will commence with a non-randomized cohort of three eligible patients treated with DSR 2.0  administered via a peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheter  on top of usual care for congestive heart failure for up to four weeks followed by a three-month safety follow-up period. Progress to the randomized cohort of up to 30 additional patients depends on approval from the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) following review of the non-randomized cohort data.The randomized cohort consists of up to 20 randomized patients treated with DSR 2.0  administered via a PD catheter  on top of usual care for congestive heart failure for up to four weeks and up to ten randomized patients treated with intravenous loop diuretics alone as part of maximized usual care for congestive heart failure. Following four weeks of treatment  there is a three-month safety follow-up period.Primary and secondary safety and efficacy endpoints include the rate of adverse and serious adverse events and the improvement in diuretic response (measured as a six-hour urine sodium output) from baseline through the end of the treatment period. Exploratory endpoints measured from baseline through the end of the treatment period include change in weight (volume status)  creatinine (a marker of renal function)  natriuretic peptides (a marker of heart failure) and New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class; and the number of heart failure related rehospitalizations.For more information  please contact:Sequana MedicalLies VannesteDirector Investor RelationsE: IR@sequanamedical.comT: +32 (0)498 053579Optimum Strategic CommunicationsNick Bastin  Jonathan Edwards  Vici RabbettsE: Sequana@optimumcomms.comT: +44 (0) 208 078 4357About DSR in congestive heart failureSequana Medical considers its proprietary DSR to be a disease modifying therapy for congestive heart failure. Fluid accumulation in heart failure patients is caused by the retention of too much sodium. The DSR drug-based approach directly tackles this key clinical problem of sodium overload  and works in partnership with the kidneys to safely and rapidly eliminate the excess fluid. Complementary to existing heart failure therapies  clinical proof-of-concept studies using the Company's first-generation DSR product (DSR 1.0) have shown that DSR can i) safely  effectively and rapidly eliminate fluid overload in heart failure patients  ii) improve the health of the heart and preserve renal function  and iii) restore the ability of the kidney to manage the fluid and sodium naturally  resulting in a large and long-lasting reduction in the need for diuretic drugs. In DSR treated patients  there have been no congestion-related re-hospitalizations during the study follow-up period  all patients improved their NYHA status by at least one class and the clinical benefits observed in the clinical studies resulted in a 75% reduction in predicted one-year mortality of patients pre- vs. post-intensive DSR therapy based on the Seattle Heart Failure Model.About Sequana MedicalSequana Medical NV is a pioneer in treating fluid overload  a serious and frequent clinical complication in patients with liver disease  heart failure and cancer. These patients can have up to 15 liters of extra fluid in their bodies  causing major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility that severely impacts daily life. Although diuretics are standard of care  the problem is that in many patients they are no longer effective and / or tolerable. There are limited effective treatment options for these patients  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life.

(OSE/NYSE: FLNG) today release its 2022 Annual ESG Report. This is the fifth edition of our ESG report after the inaugural report in 2018 and contains key information about our commitment to the Environment  Social development  and Governance (“ESG”) issues.The report presents our material ESG performance  along with how we manage material sustainability topics  for the financial year ended December 31  2022.The ESG report is prepared in accordance with requirements of the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board’s (SASB) Marine Transportation Standard (2018) and the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards (2021). It is based on the NASDAQ ESG Reporting Guide 2.0 and Euronext Guidelines to issuers for ESG reporting. The report is also prepared in line with the disclosure requirements of the UN Global Compact.The ESG report attached is also available on the company’s website www.flexlng.com. An index of disclosures responding to the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI  core option) is also available on our website.Øystein M. Kalleklev  Chief Executive Officer of Flex LNG Management AS  commented:“We are pleased to publish our fifth edition of the annual ESG report. ESG is an integral part of our business strategy and we will continue to broaden the scope of our initiatives and our ESG reporting. In 2022 we broadened the reporting scope with also reporting under the Climate Disclosure Project (“CDP”) where the score of B- was released in December last year. Further in 2022 we established a ESG committee and incorporated ESG as part of the executive pay considerations. Our business strategy is to transport LNG  which is primarily utilized to replace coal and to some extent diesel in power generation  in the safest way with as little impact on the environment as possible. Replacing coal with natural gas cuts CO2 emissions by about half  but also cleans up the local environment due to the clean burning properties of natural gas.”For further queries  please contact:Øystein M.

Recurring revenues (82%) up 7% organically; non-recurring revenues up 2% organically. Digital & services revenues (94%) grew 7% organically; print revenues declined 5% organically. Expert solutions revenues (58%) grew 7% organically.First-quarter adjusted operating profit margin decreased 270 basis points. Personnel costs and personnel-related expenses increased  as expected.First-quarter adjusted free cash flow decreased 23% in constant currencies  mainly due to lower working capital inflows related to timing of payments.Net debt-to-EBITDA was 1.3x as of March 31  2023.Progress on 2023 share buyback: €303 million of intended share buyback of up to €1 billion completed in the year through May 1  2023.Nancy McKinstry  CEO and Chair of the Executive Board  commented: “We have seen a good start to the year  with performance broadly as expected. Product investment has been sustained at high levels as we continue to pursue opportunities for organic growth while enhancing our solutions for customers. The creation of a fifth division  Corporate Performance & ESG  was implemented in March and our teams around the world are focused on executing on our strategy. We are confident in reiterating our guidance for full-year 2023.”First - q uarter 202 3 d evelopmentsFirst-quarter revenues increased 5% in constant currencies  reflecting organic growth of 6% (1Q 2022: 8%)  partly offset by the impact of net divestitures. In the first quarter  the average EUR/USD rate was favorable (averaging 1.07 in 1Q 2023 versus 1.12 in 1Q 2022). Recurring revenues (82% of revenues)  which include subscriptions and other repeating revenue streams  increased 7% organically (1Q 2022: 8%). Non-recurring revenues (18% of revenues) rose 2% organically  marking an expected slowdown from a year ago (1Q 2022: 9%). Of non-recurring revenues  Governance  Risk & Compliance transactional revenues declined 1% organically (1Q 2022: 1% increase). Print book trends were mixed. Other non-recurring revenues  mainly comprised of on-premise software licenses and implementation fees  rose 2% organically against a tough comparable (1Q 2022: 14% organic growth). The adjusted operating profit margin declined 270 basis points in the first quarter  reflecting the expected increase in personnel costs and personnel-related expenses such as office and travel costs.In March  we implemented the new five-division structure announced on February 22  2023. The discussion below still follows the previous four-division reporting structure. Pro forma historical figures for the five divisions will be provided in advance of our half-year 2023 report.Health revenues grew 5% organically (1Q 2022: 9%). Clinical Solutions grew 6% organically (1Q 2022: 9%)  led by our clinical decision support solution  UpToDate  and patient engagement solution  Emmi. Clinical drug information revenues returned to mid-single digit organic growth. Learning  Research & Practice grew 3% organically against a challenging comparable (1Q 2022: 9%). Digital subscription revenues for medical research and nursing solutions grew 4% organically  while print books  journal advertising  and other non-recurring revenues declined.Tax & Accounting revenues grew 11% organically (1Q 2022: 9%). Our North American professional Tax & Accounting business sustained double-digit organic growth  mainly driven by cloud software  including the CCH Axcess suite. The North American business benefitted from continued strength of outsourced professional services and a favorable print book publishing schedule. Professional Tax & Accounting in Europe and Asia Pacific both recorded a strong start to the year. Our Corporate Performance unit  comprising CCH Tagetik and U.S. Corporate Tax  recorded accelerated double-digit organic growth  supported by strong performance in cloud software and services across all major global regions.Governance  Risk & Compliance revenues were flat on an organic basis against a tough comparable (1Q 2022: 8%)  largely as expected. A 6% decline in non-recurring revenues (37% of division revenues) was offset by 4% organic growth in recurring revenues. In Legal Services  organic growth was 2% (1Q 2022: 7%)  as solid growth in recurring subscriptions was partly offset by a 2% organic decline in Legal Services transactional revenues. In Financial Services  organic revenues declined 3% (1Q 2022: organic growth of 8%)  as momentum in recurring revenues slowed and non-recurring revenues declined. Lien Solutions and mortgage transaction volumes declined while on-premise software license and implementation fees were lower than a year ago.Legal & Regulatory revenues grew 7% organically (1Q 2022: 6%). Legal & Regulatory Information Solutions (74% of divisional revenues) delivered stable 3% organic growth (1Q 2022: 3%)  as digital and services subscriptions increased 8% organically (1Q 2022: 7%)  more than compensating for a decline in training and other non-recurring products. The Enablon EHS/ORM1 platform delivered double-digit organic growth in both recurring cloud subscriptions and non-recurring software license fees in the quarter. In constant currencies  divisional revenues declined 3% due to the divestment on November 30  2022  of legal publishing assets in France and Spain.Cash flow and net debtFirst-quarter adjusted free cash flow declined 23% in constant currencies  due to lower working capital inflow in the quarter as a result of timing of payments. In addition  capital expenditure increased due to investments in innovation. Paid financing cost and paid tax were lower than a year ago. Net cash spend on acquisitions was €24 million  mainly related to the acquisition of NurseTim on January 9  2023. A total of €230 million in cash was deployed towards share repurchases during the quarter.As of March 31  2023  net debt was €2 227 million  compared to €2 253 million at December 31  2022. Net-debt-to-EBITDA  based on rolling twelve-month EBITDA  was 1.3x at the end of March 2023  compared to 1.3x at year-end 2022. As of March 31  2023  the number of issued ordinary shares outstanding (excluding 10.5 million shares held in treasury) was 247.0 million.In early April  we issued a new €700 million Eurobond with an 8-year term and 3.750% annual coupon.Dividends and s hare b uybacksIn the year to date (through May 1)  Wolters Kluwer has repurchased 2.8 million ordinary shares for a total consideration of €303 million (average share price €109.22). This includes a block trade of €43.5 million executed on February 23  2023  to offset the dilution caused by our incentive share issuance.For the period starting May 4  2023  up to and including July 31  2023  we have engaged a third party to execute €200 million in share buybacks on our behalf  within the limits of relevant laws and regulations (in particular Regulation (EU) 596/2014) and Wolters Kluwer’s Articles of Association. Share repurchases will be used for capital reduction purposes and to meet obligations arising from share-based incentive plans.At the Annual General Meeting to be held on May 10  2023  shareholders will be asked to approve a total dividend of €1.81 over financial year 2022  an increase of 15% compared to the 2021 dividend. If approved  the final dividend of €1.18 per share will be paid to shareholders on June 6  2023 (ADRs: June 13  2023). The interim dividend for 2023 will be set at 40% of the 2022 total dividend.ESG d evelopmentsIn the first quarter  we made progress in advancing our ESG performance. In the area of human capital  we continued efforts to attract and retain talent and to support employee engagement and belonging. A range of initiatives around training and career development are planned for 2023. Efforts to reduce our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions continued  with our global real estate team on track to deliver a further reduction in absolute square meters of office space in 2023. Our program of decommissioning on-premise servers continued as we migrated applications and customers to energy-efficient cloud platforms. As reported previously  in early 2023  we submitted near-term targets to the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) for validation  to reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 50% and absolute Scope 3 GHG emissions by 30% by the year 2030 from a 2019 base year. We are continuing our review of the new EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) in preparation for its application in 2024.Full- y ear 202 3 o utlookOur guidance for 2023 is provided below. We continue to expect full-year organic growth to be in line with the prior year and the adjusted operating profit margin to improve. We continue to expect first half 2023 organic growth to be slower compared to the prior year period  most notably in Governance  Risk & Compliance and Health. We continue to expect the adjusted operating margin to decline in the first half before improving in the second half.Full-year 2023 outlook Performance indicators 2023 Guidance 2022 Actual Adjusted operating profit margin* 26.1%-26.5% 26.1% Adjusted free cash flow** Around €1 200 million €1 220 million ROIC* 16.5%-17.0% 15.5% Diluted adjusted EPS growth** High-single-digit 8% *Guidance for adjusted operating profit margin and ROIC is in reporting currency and assumes an average EUR/USD rate in 2023 of €/$1.07. **Guidance for adjusted free cash flow and diluted adjusted EPS is in constant currencies (€/$ 1.05). Guidance reflects share repurchases of €1 billion in 2023.If the current U.S. dollar rate persists  currency will have a slightly negative effect on full-year 2023 results reported in euros. In 2022  Wolters Kluwer generated over 60% of revenues and adjusted operating profit in North America. As a rule of thumb  based on our 2022 currency profile  each 1 U.S. cent move in the average €/$ exchange rate for the year causes an opposite change of approximately 3 euro cents in diluted adjusted EPS2.We include restructuring costs in adjusted operating profit. We expect 2023 restructuring costs to be in the range of €10-€15 million (FY 2022: €6 million).We expect adjusted net financing costs3 in constant currencies to be approximately €40 million. We expect the benchmark tax rate on adjusted pre-tax profits to be in the range of 23.0%-24.0% (FY 2022: 22.6%).Capital expenditure is expected to increase but to remain within our normal range of 5.0%-6.0% of total revenues (FY 2022: 5.4%). We expect full-year cash conversion ratio to be approximately 100% (FY 2022: 107%).Our guidance assumes no additional significant change to the scope of operations. We may make further acquisitions or disposals which can be dilutive to margins  earnings  and ROIC in the near term.The impact of discontinuing activities in Russia and Belarus is expected to be immaterial to the consolidated financial results in 2023.2023 Outlook by divisionHealth: we expect full-year organic growth to be in line with prior year and the full-year adjusted operating profit margin to be stable.Tax & Accounting: we expect full-year organic growth to be in line with prior year and the full-year adjusted operating profit margin to be stable.Governance  Risk & Compliance: we expect full-year organic growth to be in line with prior year and the full-year adjusted operating profit margin to improve modestly.Legal & Regulatory: we expect full-year organic growth to be in line with prior year and full-year adjusted operating profit margin to improve modestly.About Wolters KluwerWolters Kluwer (EURONEXT: WKL) is a global leader in information  software solutions and services for professionals in healthcare; tax and accounting; financial and corporate compliance; legal and regulatory; corporate performance and ESG.

In China  the market was still impacted by COVID-related disruptions  but the company started to see increased economic activity following the reopening.The Adjusted gross margin increased by 100 bps to 39.3%  mainly driven by continued price discipline and effective COGS management. Adjusted indirect costs as a percentage of sales increased by 240 bps to 31.9%  as the reduction of indirect costs was not sufficient to compensate lower sales.Adjusted EBITA decreased to EUR 149 million. The Adjusted EBITA margin decreased by 160 bps to 8.9%  mainly due to under-absorption of fixed costs and an adverse currency effect from the weakening of emerging market currencies  the strengthening of the US Dollar  and a one-off impact from the implementation of a new hedging policy.Restructuring costs were EUR 47 million and were mainly related to Conventional Products. These restructuring costs were in line with the strategy to adjust Conventional Products' footprint to declining sales. Acquisition-related charges were EUR 3 million and incidental items were EUR 16 million  mainly related to additions to environmental provisions.Net income decreased to EUR 28 million  mainly due to lower income from operations and higher financial expenses  partly offset by lower income tax expense due to lower taxable income and a release of tax liabilities. The higher financial expenses were mainly related to a non-cash fair value adjustment of the Virtual Power Purchase Agreements due to lower energy prices  and higher interest costs.The number of employees (FTE) decreased from 36 884 at the end of Q1 22 to 34 408 at the end of Q1 23. The year-on-year decrease is mostly related to a reduction of factory personnel due to lower production volumes. In general  the number of FTEs is affected by fluctuations in volume and seasonality.¹ This press release contains certain non-IFRS financial measures and ratios  such as comparable sales growth  EBITA  adjusted EBITA and free cash flow  and related ratios  which are not recognized measures of financial performance or liquidity under IFRS.

It is detected in blood lymphocytes and serum  from about 20% of all positive individuals at PCR diagnosis to 100% of severe cases hospitalized in intensive care unit. W-ENV was also found in post-mortem tissues of lungs  heart  gastrointestinal tract  brain olfactory bulb and nasal mucosa from COVID-19 patients. Altogether  results from this comprehensive study demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 could induce W-ENV expression and suggest its involvement in the immunopathogenesis of certain COVID-19-associated syndromes and thereby its relevance in the development of personalized treatment of patients.Cell publishes findings of unusual significance in any area of experimental biology  including but not limited to cell biology  molecular biology  neuroscience  immunology  virology and microbiology  cancer  human genetics  systems biology  signaling  and disease mechanisms and therapeutics. Its 2022 impact factor is 66.85.""Our research suggests that HERV-W ENV does not simply represent a biomarker of COVID-19 severity or evolution but is also likely to be a superimposed pathogenic player that contributes to the disease severity and may help to explain the inter-individual variability in COVID-19 manifestations. In addition  it may play a role in the clinical evolution with possible long-term pathology as seen with the now emerging Long-COVID secondary pandemic  representing millions of patients suffering from various symptoms and long-term disabling pathology for which no rationalized understanding nor therapeutic perspective can be proposed to date.

(Euronext Amsterdam: MAJ) (“Majorel”  the ‘’Company”)  a global customer experience (CX) leader  today reports on topline results[1] for Q1 2023.HIGHLIGHTSContinued topline growth  with group revenue of €541 million  +11% YOY (Q1 2022: €489 million) and net revenue[2] of €535 million  +11% YOY (Q1 2022: €480 million).Like-for-like[3] net revenue growth of +15% YOY  adjusted for M&A[4]  and COVID-19 related business[5]. The reduction in COVID-19 related business (€26 million) was partially offset by the (pro-rata) contribution from last year’s acquisitions (€9 million)[6].Maintaining momentum in Q1 2023 with robust net revenue growth across all business Segments: EASA (Europe  Africa  and South America) delivered net revenue of €387  an increase of +9% (Q1 2022: €354 million). Like-for-like net revenue in EASA increased by +14% in Q1 2023; GEMS (Global English  Middle East  and Southeast Asia) net revenue increased by +18% to €118 million (Q1 2022: €100 million); CEA (China and East Asia) delivered net revenue of €29 million  up by +15% (Q1 2022: €26 million).Full year 2023 Outlook remains unchanged.Commenting on the topline results  Thomas Mackenbrock  CEO of Majorel Group said: “I am pleased to report healthy topline growth of 11% in the first quarter of 2023  with a robust performance across all of Majorel’s business Segments. Despite the challenging and more volatile market environment  we have continued to drive the business forward. Our focus will remain on relentlessly delivering amazing CX for our clients and their customers  and also being the best home for talent for our more than 82 000 team members around the world.”Referring to the recent announcement  by Teleperformance on April  26  on its proposed acquisition of Majorel  Thomas said: “Becoming part of the TP family is the next natural step in our journey. There are exciting prospects for our clients and team members in joining forces with the Teleperformance team that has paved the way in global digital services over the last four decades. We share the same core values and believe that this new combination will provide many opportunities for all stakeholders.”Revenue  net revenue  and net revenue by business SegmentQ1 2023 Q1 2022 YOY change Revenue €541m €489m +11% Net revenue €535m €480m +11% EASA Segment €387m €354m +9% GEMS Segment €118m €100m +18% CEA Segment €29m €26m +15%Adjusted for the impact of FX  group revenue growth in Q1 2023 was 11%[7]  with an FX impact on group revenue of -0.1% (Q1 2022: +1.6%).EASA Segment: Europe  Africa  and South AmericaNet revenue from the EASA Segment (Europe  Africa  South America) was €387 million in Q1 2023 (Q1 2022: €354 million). The increase of +9% compared to Q1 2022 included the (pro-rata) contribution of the acquisitions completed in 2022 (in total accounting for €9 million of net revenue)  partially compensating for the natural ending of COVID-19-related business at the end of 2022 (€26 million net revenue contribution in Q1 2022).Like-for-like  adjusted for M&A[8] and the decline of COVID-19-related business  net revenue in EASA increased by +14% in Q1 2023. This growth was mainly driven by existing and new clients in Global Internet  and the Utilities vertical  as well as the solid development in our near- and offshore locations in Africa  Eastern Europe  and South America.GEMS Segment: Global English  Middle East  and Southeast AsiaNet revenue from the GEMS Segment (Global English  Middle East  Southeast Asia) was €118 million in Q1 2023 (Q1 2022: €100 million)  an increase of +18%. The key driver for this growth was the solid increase of net revenue with Global Internet clients  particularly in the US  the Philippines  and Malaysia; and growth in Saudi Arabia.CEA Segment: China and East AsiaThe CEA Segment reported net revenue of €29 million in Q1 2023 (Q1 2022: €26 million). The growth rate of +15% was driven by the expansion into Japan and South Korea  and the continuing development of digital engagement services in China  with a focus on consumer products and digital clients.UPDATE ON BUSINESS DEVELOPMENTStrategic KPIsAt the end of Q1 2023  51% of net revenue was from Global Internet Clients (FY 2022: 52%)  including 23% of net revenue from Majorel's Content Services  Trust & Safety line of business (FY 2022: 23%). Majorel is committed to providing essential services to its clients  and believes strongly that its services in Content Services  Trust & Safety serve an important function  in ensuring the internet is a safer place for everyone.Tech & Expert Services (T&E) represented 9% of net revenue in the first quarter of 2023 (FY 2022: 9%)  impacted by the natural ending of the COVID-19 related business  which is partially reported within T&E. In December 2022  we launched Majorel X as a platform for CX transformation services. Its comprehensive portfolio spans CX Consulting  Technology  and Design and Creative Services. Majorel X addresses the increasing client demand for an integrated approach to CX transformation.Offshore[9]represented 42% of net revenue in Q1 2023 (FY 2022: 43%). Net revenue from the Telco sector represented 9% of net revenue (FY 2022: 9%).Growth with clientsAcross all our verticals  we continue to work in true partnership with our clients  both new and existing  and with deep roots built on mutual trust. In Q1 2023  this resulted in net revenue retention[10] (NRR) of 116% (Q1 2022: 116%).OUTLOOKThis outlook is based on Majorel’s current assessment on the development of the business in 2023 and the general CX market  combined with economic and labor market conditions in the Company’s global geographic footprint.For 2023  we expect shifting client needs  some softness in demand  absence of COVID-19-related business  and continued (wage) inflation due to the challenging and more volatile environment. Moreover  ongoing macro-economic uncertainties serve to highlight the importance of ongoing vigilance.Therefore  based on current assumptions  we expect to grow our net revenue to €2 150-2 250 million. Excluding COVID-19-related business in 2022  this would result in net revenue growth of around +6% to +11%.Further  the Company expects its Operating EBITDA margin for 2023 to be between 16.5%-17.0%  also factoring in the above-mentioned effects.We will continue to execute our proven strategy  driven by the expertise and commitment of our people  and built on the trust and loyalty of our long-term clients.FINANCIAL CALENDAR (INDICATIVE NEXT DATE)Annual General Meeting June 22  2023ABOUT MAJORELWe’re a global CX leader.

Management reporting data excludes revenues from minor activities (primarily the Sonopress Business) outside Majorel Group’s core business which are reported in the Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements (the “Sonopress Business” is defined as certain non-core business activities historically carried out by Arvato de Mexico  S.A. de C.V.  which was wound down in 2021). Management believes that the inclusion of supplementary adjustments to Revenue applied in presenting net revenue are appropriate to provide additional information.

(“AMG”  EURONEXT AMSTERDAM: “AMG”) reported first quarter 2023 revenue of $451 million  a 12% increase versus the same period in 2022. First quarter 2023 EBITDA of $118 million was more than double the EBITDA of $55 million for the first three months of last year  and represents an all-time high for AMG’s quarterly EBITDA. In 000’s US dollars Q1 ‘23 Q1 ‘22 Change Revenue $450 590 $403 863 12% EBITDA (1) 118 111 54 760 116% Cash from (used in) operating activities 93 395 (3 654) N/A Net income attributable to shareholders 56 221 29 115 93% EPS - Fully diluted 1.72 0.89 93% Return on Capital Employed 37.9% 19.8% Note:(1) EBITDA is defined as EBIT adjusted for depreciation and amortization.Dr. Heinz Schimmelbusch  Chairman of the Management Board and CEO  said  “I am pleased to announce that AMG will change its name  subject to the approval of our shareholders in the upcoming Annual General Meeting  from AMG Advanced Metallurgical Group N.V. to AMG Critical Materials N.V. We have also achieved new record earnings and operating cash flow. This is the third straight quarter in which AMG has exceeded $100 million of EBITDA. The $63 million  or 116%  EBITDA increase over the first quarter of 2022 was driven largely by our Clean Energy Materials segment  specifically AMG Lithium and its Brazil operation with an EBITDA contribution of $92 million. AMG’s liquidity as of March 31  2023 was $555 million  with $360 million of unrestricted cash and $195 million of revolving credit availability. The Company will pay its final 2022 declared dividend of €0.40 per ordinary share on or around May 11  2023  to shareholders of record on May 9  2023. The record results are due to our recent expansion projects. The profitability going forward is also driven by the strategic projects coming on stream in 2023 and 2024  in particular our lithium concentrate expansion and our first lithium hydroxide refinery module in Bitterfeld. We thereby confirm our guidance for 2023 to exceed $400 million in EBITDA.” Strategic Highlights Lithium The lithium concentrate production expansion project in AMG Brazil is progressing as planned.AMG Lithium’s hydroxide refinery in Bitterfeld  Germany  Europe’s first  is under construction  with commissioning for the first 20 000-ton module expected in the fourth quarter of 2023.Regarding its development of solid state battery materials  AMG Lithium GmbH has engaged in a joint production with Fraunhofer Institute  Münster University  Wacker  and Schunk to develop next generation solid-state batteries based on lithium-sulfur technology. AMG Lithium will provide lithium sulfide and solid electrolytes for this project.AMG has a 25% shareholding in Zinnwald Lithium PLC and is supporting the Zinnwald Board to accelerate the development of its lithium project in Eastern Germany.Vanadium The new vanadium spent catalyst recycling facility in Zanesville  Ohio  continues to progress  with the roaster operating at its design capacity and the melt shop targeting full production capacity later in the second quarter of this year.AMG’s innovative lithium vanadium battery (“LIVA”) projects for industrial power management applications outlined at our Capital Markets Day are being executed as planned.AMG has completed the expansion of its vanadium oxide (“V 2 O 5 ”) production in Nuremberg  either using gasification ash or spent catalyst as alternative feed. V 2 O 5 is increasingly destined for the LIVA battery market.O ”) production in Nuremberg  either using gasification ash or spent catalyst as alternative feed. V O is increasingly destined for the LIVA battery market. In January 2023  AMG started building a vanadium electrolyte plant at its subsidiary  AMG Titanium  in Nuremberg  Germany. The target capacity is 6 000 m³ vanadium electrolyte  which will serve the electricity storage market. Production is expected to start at the end of this year.Shell & AMG Recycling B.V. (“SARBV”) continues to advance its projects in the Middle East including the first phase of the Supercenter project based on long-term supply agreements with ARAMCO. Front end engineering design for the first phase of the project  the conversion of gasification ash into V 2 O 5   began in late 2022 and will be completed in the fourth quarter of 2023.Financial Highlights Revenue increased by 12% to $451 million in the first quarter of 2023 from $404 million in the first quarter of 2022.EBITDA was $118 million in the first quarter of 2023  up 116% versus the first quarter 2022 EBITDA of $55 million.Annualized return on capital employed was 37.9% for the first quarter of 2023  compared to 19.8% for the first three months of 2022.Cash from operating activities was $93 million in the first quarter of 2023  an increase of $97 million over the same period in 2022.Net income attributable to shareholders for the first three months of 2023 was $56 million  yielding $1.72 diluted earnings per share compared to $0.89 for the same period in 2022.AMG’s liquidity as of March 31  2023 was $555 million  with $360 million of unrestricted cash and $195 million of revolving credit availability.The Company will pay its final 2022 declared dividend of €0.40 per ordinary share on or around May 11  2023  to shareholders of record on May 9  2023.Key Figures In 000’s US dollars Q1 ‘23 Q1 ‘22 Change Revenue $450 590 $403 863 12% Gross profit 139 842 75 194 86% Gross margin 31.0% 18.6% Operating profit 100 023 37 814 165% Operating margin 22.2% 9.4% Net income attributable to shareholders 56 221 29 115 93% EPS - Fully diluted 1.72 0.89 93% EBIT (1) 105 144 44 233 138% EBITDA (2) 118 111 54 760 116% EBITDA margin 26.2% 13.6% Cash from (used in) operating activities 93 395 (3 654) N/A Notes: (1) EBIT is defined as earnings before interest and income taxes.

Operational Review AMG Clean Energy Materials Q1 ‘23 Q1 ‘22 Change Revenue $219 080 $143 659 53% Gross profit 108 957 39 004 179% Operating profit 95 643 28 219 239% EBITDA 106 137 37 227 185% AMG Clean Energy Materials’ revenue increased 53% compared to the first quarter of 2022  to $219 million  driven mainly by higher prices in tantalum and lithium concentrates  as well as increased sales volumes of vanadium and tantalum concentrate. Gross profit for the quarter increased 179% compared to the same period in the prior year  primarily due to the increased price environment. SG&A expenses in the first quarter of 2023 were 23% higher than the same period in 2022  largely due to higher personnel costs and variable compensation expense mainly driven by the increase in headcount related to the lithium and vanadium expansion projects. The first quarter 2023 EBITDA increased 185%  to $106 million  from $37 million in the first quarter of 2022  due to the improved gross profit as noted above. During the first quarter of 2023  a total of 20 509 dry metric tons (“dmt”) of lithium concentrates was sold. The average realized sales price was $4 846/dmt CIF China for the quarter. The average cost per ton for the quarter was $338/dmt CIF China. This exceptional cost per ton result was driven by high sales volumes of tantalum concentrate in the quarter  and drove a quarterly EBITDA figure for AMG Brazil of $92 million. AMG Critical Minerals Q1 ‘23 Q1 ‘22 Change Revenue $62 929 $106 909 (41%) Gross profit 7 266 13 002 (44%) Operating profit 635 5 647 (89%) EBITDA 2 550 7 883 (68%) AMG Critical Minerals’ revenue for the first quarter of 2023 decreased by $44 million  or 41%  to $63 million  mainly due to lower volumes across the segment which was primarily driven by the silicon metal plant care and maintenance plan for the first two months of 2023 prior to restarting and operating one furnace in March discussed in detail below. The segment also suffered from a slowdown in the European industrial economy. Gross profit of $7 million in the first quarter was $6 million lower compared to the first quarter of 2022  largely due to the lower volumes in the first three months of this year. SG&A expenses in the first quarter of 2023 decreased by 3%  to $7 million  compared to the same period in 2022. This was driven by lower personnel costs and variable compensation expense in the current quarter due to the interruptions in AMG Silicon’s operations earlier this quarter. The first quarter 2023 EBITDA decreased 68% compared to the same period in 2022  to $3 million  due to the lower gross profit as noted above. As of March 1  2023  AMG’s silicon metal plant in Pocking  Germany  restarted operating one furnace. AMG Silicon is operating one furnace throughout the second quarter and plans to operate one furnace in the third quarter. The operational parameters of the silicon business will continue to be reviewed on an ongoing basis and will be adjusted as appropriate in line with favorable and predictable market conditions. Due to the noted interruptions in silicon operations  the financial impact of the business will be excluded from EBITDA during this period of abnormal operations. However  AMG Silicon generated $11 million in cash flow from operating activities during the quarter driven by the receipt of energy sales made in the fourth quarter of 2022. The financial impact of the care and maintenance program does not significantly impact AMG’s overall projected 2023 financial results. AMG Critical Materials Technologies Q1 ‘23 Q1 ‘22 Change Revenue $168 581 $153 295 10% Gross profit 23 619 23 188 2% Operating profit 3 745 3 948 (5%) EBITDA 9 424 9 650 (2%) AMG Critical Materials Technologies' first quarter 2023 revenue increased by $15 million  or 10%  compared to the same period in 2022. This improvement was driven by higher sales volumes of titanium alloys and chrome metal. SG&A expenses increased by 3% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022  due to an increase in personnel costs and higher variable compensation expense in the current quarter. AMG Critical Materials Technologies’ EBITDA was $9 million during the quarter compared to $10 million in the same period of 2022. The slight decrease was due to lower sequential chrome prices in the first quarter  partially offset by stronger profitability from our Engineering business. AMG Engineering signed $76 million in new orders during the first quarter of 2023  driven by strong orders of remelting  turbine blade and heat treatment furnaces  representing a 1.21x book to bill ratio. Order backlog was $237 million as of March 31  2023  the highest since March 31  2020. Financial Review Tax AMG recorded an income tax expense of $36 million in the first quarter of 2023  compared to a tax benefit of $1 million in the first quarter of 2022. This variance was mainly driven by higher profitability in AMG Lithium at its Brazil operation coupled with movements in the Brazilian real. The effects of the Brazilian real caused a $2 million tax expense in the first three months of 2023  compared to a $15 million benefit in the same period in 2022. Fluctuations in the Brazilian real exchange rate impact the valuation of the Company’s net deferred tax positions related to our operations in Brazil. AMG paid taxes of $21 million in the first quarter of 2023  compared to tax payments of $4 million in the first quarter of 2022. The higher cash payments this quarter were largely a result of higher profitability in Brazil. Exceptional Items AMG’s first quarter 2023 gross profit includes exceptional items  which are not included in the calculation of EBITDA. A summary of exceptional items included in gross profit in the first quarters of 2023 and 2022 are below: Exceptional items included in gross profit Q1 ‘23 Q1 ‘22 Change Gross profit $139 842 $75 194 86% Inventory cost adjustment 510 — N/A Restructuring (reversal) expense (263) 141 N/A Asset impairment reversal (767) — N/A Silicon’s partial closure (156) — N/A Strategic project (reversal) expense (51) 2 265 N/A Gross profit excluding exceptional items 139 115 77 600 79% The asset impairment reversal during the first quarter of 2023 was due to an insurance recovery on previously impaired machinery and equipment. SG&A AMG’s first quarter 2023 SG&A expenses were $40 million compared to $37 million in the first quarter of 2022  with the increase largely attributable to higher personnel costs and variable compensation expense mainly driven by the increase in headcount related to the lithium and vanadium expansion projects in our Clean Energy Materials segment. Liquidity March 31  2023 December 31  2022 Change Senior secured debt $339 061 $348 622 (3%) Cash & cash equivalents 359 525 346 043 4% Senior secured net (cash) debt (20 464) 2 579 N/A Other debt 14 801 14 959 (1%) Net (cash) debt excluding municipal bond (5 663) 17 538 N/A Municipal bond debt 319 185 319 244 —% Restricted cash 2 911 6 920 (58%) Net debt 310 611 329 862 (6%) AMG ended the quarter in a $311 million net debt position. This decrease versus year-end 2022 was mainly due to $10 million of debt repayment and higher unrestricted cash of $14 million  offset by the utilization of restricted cash associated with the municipal bond. AMG continued to maintain a strong balance sheet and adequate sources of liquidity during the first quarter. As of March 31  2023  the Company had $360 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and $195 million available on its revolving credit facility. As such  AMG had $555 million of total liquidity as of March 31  2023. Net Finance Costs AMG’s first quarter 2023 net finance cost was $7 million compared to $9 million in the first quarter of 2022. This variance was mainly driven by foreign exchange gains of $2 million during the quarter primarily due to non-cash intergroup balances. AMG capitalized $2 million of interest costs in the first quarter of 2023 versus $4 million in the same period in 2022. This decrease is mainly driven by the interest associated with the expansion projects in AMG Lithium and Brazil operations compared to a higher capitalized interest associated with the Company's tax-exempt municipal bond supporting the vanadium expansion in Ohio in prior year. Outlook AMG reaffirms its guidance for the full year 2023 to exceed $400 million EBITDA. Regarding AMG's 5-year guidance  the outstanding progress we have made with our strategic growth projects and given the compelling long-term supply and demand dynamics in the lithium market  we are issuing new guidance to achieve $650 million EBITDA  or more  in 5 years or earlier.

We see opportunity across our business and are uniquely positioned to execute on delivering growth and value to our stakeholders.” Highlights for the Three Months Ended March 31  2023 Reported net income allocable to common shareholders of $2.65 per diluted share. Reported core FFO allocable to common shareholders (“Core FFO”) of $4.08 per diluted share  an increase of 11.8% relative to the same period in 2022. Core FFO per diluted share increased 16.2% compared to the same period in 2022  excluding the contribution from our equity investment in PS Business Parks  Inc.  which we sold in July 2022. Increased Same Store (as defined below) direct net operating income by 10.2%  resulting from a 9.8% increase in Same Store revenues. Achieved 78.9% Same Store direct net operating income margin  an increase of 0.4% relative to the same period in 2022. Acquired five self-storage facilities with 0.3 million net rentable square feet for $46.8 million. Subsequent to March 31  2023  we acquired or were under contract to acquire 12 self-storage facilities with 0.9 million net rentable square feet  for $139.0 million. Opened three newly developed facilities and completed various expansion projects with 0.4 million net rentable square feet costing $65.3 million. At March 31  2023  we had various facilities in development and expansion with 4.8 million net rentable square feet estimated to cost $1.0 billion. Operating Results for the Three Months Ended March 31  2023 For the three months ended March 31  2023  net income allocable to our common shareholders was $467.6 million or $2.65 per diluted common share  compared to $464.1 million or $2.63 per diluted common share for the same period in 2022  representing an increase of $3.5 million or $0.02 per diluted common share. The increase is due primarily to (i) a $92.0 million increase in self-storage net operating income and (ii) a $15.3 million increase in interest and other income  partially offset by (iii) a $62.2 million increase in foreign currency exchange losses primarily associated with our Euro denominated notes payable and (iv) a $37.4 million decrease in equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate entities due to our sale of PSB in July 2022. The $92.0 million increase in self-storage net operating income in the three months ended March 31  2023 as compared to the same period in 2022 is a result of a $64.4 million increase attributable to our Same Store Facilities and a $27.6 million increase attributable to our Non-Same Store Facilities (as defined below). Revenues for the Same Store Facilities increased 9.8% or $75.5 million in the three months ended March 31  2023 as compared to the same period in 2022  due primarily to higher realized annual rent per occupied square foot  partially offset by a decline in occupancy. Cost of operations for the Same Store Facilities increased by 5.6% or $11.0 million in the three months ended March 31  2023 as compared to the same period in 2022  due primarily to increased property tax expense  repairs and maintenance expenses  marketing expense  and other direct property costs. The increase in net operating income of $27.6 million for the Non-Same Store Facilities is due primarily to the impact of facilities acquired in 2021 and 2022 and the fill-up of recently developed and expanded facilities. Funds from Operations Funds from Operations (“FFO”) and FFO per share are non-GAAP measures defined by Nareit. We believe that FFO and FFO per share are useful to REIT investors and analysts in measuring our performance because Nareit’s definition of FFO excludes items included in net income that do not relate to or are not indicative of our operating and financial performance. FFO represents net income before depreciation and amortization  which is excluded because it is based upon historical costs and assumes that building values diminish ratably over time  while we believe that real estate values fluctuate due to market conditions. FFO also excludes gains or losses on sale of real estate assets and real estate impairment charges  which are also based upon historical costs and are impacted by historical depreciation. FFO and FFO per share are not a substitute for net income or earnings per share. FFO is not a substitute for net cash flow in evaluating our liquidity or ability to pay dividends  because it excludes investing and financing activities presented on our consolidated statements of cash flows. In addition  other REITs may compute these measures differently  so comparisons among REITs may not be helpful. For the three months ended March 31  2023  FFO was $3.94 per diluted common share as compared to $3.83 for the same period in 2022  representing an increase of 2.9%. We also present “Core FFO” and “Core FFO per share ” non-GAAP measures that represent FFO and FFO per share excluding the impact of (i) foreign currency exchange gains and losses  (ii) charges related to the redemption of preferred securities  and (iii) certain other non-cash and/or nonrecurring income or expense items primarily representing  with respect to the periods presented below  the impact of contingency resolution  due diligence costs incurred in pursuit of strategic transactions  unrealized gain on private equity investments  and our equity share of severance of a senior executive from our equity investees. We review Core FFO and Core FFO per share to evaluate our ongoing operating performance  and we believe they are used by investors and REIT analysts in a similar manner. However  Core FFO and Core FFO per share are not substitutes for net income and net income per share. Because other REITs may not compute Core FFO or Core FFO per share in the same manner as we do  may not use the same terminology  or may not present such measures  Core FFO and Core FFO per share may not be comparable among REITs.

Our Same Store Facilities increased from 2 276 facilities at December 31  2022 to 2 348 at March 31  2023. The composition of our Same Store Facilities allows us to more effectively evaluate the ongoing performance of our self-storage portfolio in 2021  2022  and 2023 and exclude the impact of fill-up of unstabilized facilities  which can significantly affect operating trends. We believe the Same Store information is used by investors and analysts in a similar manner. However  because other REITs may not compute Same Store Facilities in the same manner as we do  may not use the same terminology  or may not present such a measure  Same Store Facilities may not be comparable among REITs. The following table summarizes the historical operating results (for all periods presented) of these 2 348 facilities (155.5 million net rentable square feet) that represent approximately 76% of the aggregate net rentable square feet of our U.S. consolidated self-storage portfolio at March 31  2023 (unaudited): Three Months Ended March 31  2023 2022 Percentage Change (Dollar amounts in thousands  except for per square foot data) Revenues (a): Rental income $ 820 442 $ 748 560 9.6 % Late charges and administrative fees 28 282 24 700 14.5 % Total revenues 848 724 773 260 9.8 % Direct cost of operations (a): Property taxes 76 871 73 237 5.0 % On-site property manager payroll 32 592 31 804 2.5 % Repairs and maintenance 18 052 15 940 13.2 % Utilities 12 583 11 967 5.1 % Marketing 15 580 11 740 32.7 % Other direct property costs 23 258 20 762 12.0 % Total direct cost of operations 178 936 165 450 8.2 % Direct net operating income (b) 669 788 607 810 10.2 % Indirect cost of operations (a): Supervisory payroll (9 215 ) (9 940 ) (7.3 )% Centralized management costs (15 923 ) (16 790 ) (5.2 )% Share-based compensation (3 145 ) (3 996 ) (21.3 )% Net operating income (c) $ 641 505 $ 577 084 11.2 % Gross margin (before indirect costs  depreciation and amortization expense) 78.9% 78.6% 0.4 % Gross margin (before depreciation and amortization expense) 75.6% 74.6% 1.3 % Weighted average for the period: Square foot occupancy 93.2% 95.5% (2.4 )% Realized annual rental income per (d): Occupied square foot $ 22.65 $ 20.16 12.4 % Available square foot $ 21.10 $ 19.25 9.6 % At March 31: Square foot occupancy 92.8% 95.0% (2.3 )% Annual contract rent per occupied square foot (e) $ 22.94 $ 20.71 10.8 % (a) Revenues and cost of operations do not include tenant reinsurance and merchandise sales and expenses generated at the facilities. (b) Direct net operating income (“Direct NOI”)  a subtotal within NOI  is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the impact of supervisory payroll  centralized management costs  and share-based compensation in addition to depreciation and amortization expense. We utilize direct net operating income in evaluating property performance and in evaluating property operating trends as compared to our competitors. (c) See attached reconciliation of self-storage NOI to net income. (d) Realized annual rent per occupied square foot is computed by dividing annualized rental income  before late charges and administrative fees  by the weighted average occupied square feet for the period. Realized annual rent per available square foot (“REVPAF”) is computed by dividing annualized rental income  before late charges and administrative fees  by the total available rentable square feet for the period. These measures exclude late charges and administrative fees in order to provide a better measure of our ongoing level of revenue. Late charges are dependent upon the level of delinquency  and administrative fees are dependent upon the level of move-ins. In addition  the rates charged for late charges and administrative fees can vary independently from rental rates. These measures take into consideration promotional discounts  which reduce rental income. (e) Annual contract rent represents the agreed upon monthly rate that is paid by our tenants in place at the time of measurement. Contract rates are initially set in the lease agreement upon move-in  and we adjust them from time to time with notice. Contract rent excludes other fees that are charged on a per-item basis  such as late charges and administrative fees  does not reflect the impact of promotional discounts  and does not reflect the impact of rents that are written off as uncollectible. Property Operations – Non-Same Store Facilities In addition to the 2 348 Same Store Facilities  we have 529 facilities that were not stabilized with respect to occupancies  revenues  or cost of operations since January 1  2021 or that we did not own as of January 1  2021  including 311 facilities that were acquired  49 newly developed facilities  87 facilities that have been expanded or are targeted for expansion  and 82 facilities that are unstabilized because they are undergoing fill-up or were damaged in casualty events (collectively  the “Non-Same Store Facilities”). Operating data  metrics  and further commentary with respect to these facilities  including detail by vintage  are included in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” under “Analysis of Net Income – Self-Storage Operations” in our March 31  2023 Form 10-Q. Investing and Capital Activities During the three months ended March 31  2023  we closed the acquisition of five self-storage facilities (one each in Florida  Idaho  Kentucky  Michigan  and Virginia) with 0.3 million net rentable square feet for $46.8 million. Subsequent to March 31  2023  we acquired or were under contract to acquire 12 self-storage facilities across three states with 0.9 million net rentable square feet  for $139.0 million. During 2021  we acquired a portfolio of 48 properties (4.1 million net rentable square feet) operated under the brand name of ezStorage for $1.8 billion. As of March 31  2023  we have completed the expansion projects on four facilities of this portfolio for $26.3 million  adding 169 000 net rentable square feet of storage space. These facilities generated revenues of $25.6 million  NOI of $20.0 million (including Direct NOI of $20.5 million)  and average square footage occupancy of 85.7% for the three months ended March 31  2023. During 2021  we acquired a portfolio of 56 properties (7.5 million net rentable square feet) operated under the brand name of All Storage for $1.5 billion. These facilities generated revenues of $21.4 million  NOI of $13.3 million (including Direct NOI of $14.2 million)  and average square footage occupancy of 78.5% for the three months ended March 31  2023. During the three months ended March 31  2023  we opened three newly developed facilities and completed various expansion projects (0.4 million net rentable square feet – 0.1 million each in Florida  Maryland  New Jersey  and Pennsylvania) costing $65.3 million. At March 31  2023  we had various facilities in development (2.4 million net rentable square feet) estimated to cost $537.8 million and various expansion projects (2.4 million net rentable square feet) estimated to cost $488.2 million. Our aggregate 4.8 million net rentable square foot pipeline of development and expansion facilities includes 1.7 million in California  0.9 million in Texas  0.4 million in Nevada  0.3 million each in Florida  Hawaii  and Maryland  0.2 million in Washington  and 0.7 million in other states. The remaining $648.6 million of development costs for these projects are expected to be incurred primarily in the next 18 to 24 months. Distributions Declared On May 2  2023  our Board of Trustees declared a regular common quarterly dividend of $3.00 per common share. The Board also declared dividends with respect to our various series of preferred shares. All the dividends are payable on June 29  2023 to shareholders of record as of June 14  2023. Outlook for the Year Ending December 31  2023 Set forth below are our current expectations with respect to full year 2023 Core FFO per share and certain underlying assumptions. In reliance on the exception provided by applicable SEC rules  we do not provide guidance for GAAP net income per share  the most comparable GAAP financial measure  or a reconciliation of 2023 Core FFO per share to GAAP net income per share because we are unable to reasonably predict the following items which are included in GAAP net income: (i) gains or losses on sales of real estate investments  (ii) foreign currency exchange gains and losses  (iii) charges related to the redemption of preferred securities  and (iv) certain other significant non-cash and/or nonrecurring income or expense items. The actual amounts for any and all of these items could significantly impact our 2023 GAAP net income and  as disclosed in our historical financial results  have significantly impacted GAAP net income in prior periods.

We utilize FAD in evaluating our ongoing cash flow available for investment  debt repayment  and common distributions. We believe investors and analysts utilize FAD in a similar manner. FAD is not a substitute for GAAP net cash flow in evaluating our liquidity or ability to pay dividends  because it excludes investing and financing activities presented on our statements of cash flows. In addition  other REITs may compute this measure differently  so comparisons among REITs may not be helpful.

We utilize NOI in determining current property values  evaluating property performance  and evaluating operating trends. We believe that investors and analysts utilize NOI in a similar manner. NOI is not a substitute for net income  operating cash flow  or other related GAAP financial measures  in evaluating our operating results. This table reconciles from NOI for our self-storage facilities to the net income presented on our income statement.

UCART22 is currently the most advanced allogeneic CAR T-cell product in development for relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We believe that our off-the-shelf treatment approach  coupled with our ability to manufacture UCART product candidates entirely in-house  gives us a main advantage on the market: it potentially maximizes the chances for eligible patients to be treated without delay ” said André Choulika  Ph.D.  CEO of Cellectis.“Cellectis also announced last month that it implemented the use of Sanofi’s alemtuzumab as a Cellectis Investigational Medicinal Product  coded as CLLS52  as part of the lymphodepletion regimen for UCART22 in the BALLI-01 clinical trial  for UCART123 in the AMELI-01 clinical trial  and for UCART20x22 in the NATHALI-01 clinical trial. This follows the partnership and supply agreements we entered with Sanofi regarding alemtuzumab.Story continues“This quarter  Cellectis announced the closing of the global offering of 25 million dollars of its Depository Shares  launched in February – the net proceeds of the global offering and option of the Company is 22.8 million dollars – and in April  the drawdown of the 20 million euros under the Finance Contract for up to 40 million euros credit facility made with the European Investment Bank in December 2022. Cellectis plans to use the net proceeds of the funds to focus on the development of its pipeline of allogeneic CAR T-cell product candidates UCART22  UCART20x22 and UCART123  the Company decided to stop enrollment and treatment of patients with UCARTCS1. Indeed  to accelerate the speed of enrollment of patients in the MELANI-01 study  evaluating UCARTCS1  the Company would have had to invest meaningful amount of resources. To optimize its resources  Cellectis decided to focus its development efforts on the BALLI-01  AMELI-01 and NATHALI-01 studies.“We are excited about the drive in our clinical trials  building on the momentum of our lead product candidates in our pipeline  and the upcoming milestones for 2023.”Pipeline HighlightsUCART Clinical Developments ProgramsBALLI-01 (evaluating UCART22) in relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (r/r B-ALL)UCART22 is an allogeneic CAR T-cell product candidate targeting CD22 and is being evaluated in patients with r/r B-ALL in the BALLI-01 Phase 1/2a clinical study.On April 11  Cellectis announced that the first patient in Europe was dosed in France with its in-house manufactured product candidate UCART22 and completed the 28-day Dose Limiting Toxicity period.UCART22 is currently the most advanced allogeneic CAR T-cell product in development for relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Last December  Cellectis presented updated clinical data on its BALLI-01 clinical trial at a Live Webcast.The BALLI-01 study is now enrolling patients after FCA (fludarabine  cyclophosphamide and alemtuzumab) lymphodepletion.NATHALI-01 (evaluating UCART20x22) in relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (r/r NHL)UCART20x22 is Cellectis’ first allogeneic dual CAR T-cell product candidate targeting both CD20 and CD22 and is being evaluated in patients with r/r NHL in the NATHALI-01 Phase 1/2a clinical study.The NATHALI-01 study is now enrolling patients.AMELI-01 (evaluating UCART123) in relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (r/r AML)UCART123 is an allogeneic CAR T-cell product candidate targeting CD123 and is being evaluated in patients with r/r AML in the AMELI-01 Phase 1 dose-escalation clinical study.On May 17  Cellectis will present clinical data on the AMELI-01 clinical trial in an oral presentation at the American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy (ASGCT) 2023 Annual Meeting. These data were presented in an oral presentation at the 64th American Society of Hematology (ASH) annual meeting last December. Details from the presentation will be available following the event on the Cellectis website at: https://www.cellectis.com/en/investors/scientific-presentations/The AMELI-01 study is now enrolling patients after FCA (fludarabine  cyclophosphamide and alemtuzumab) lymphodepletion in a two-dose regimen arm.MELANI-01 (evaluating UCARTCS1) in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (r/r MM)UCARTCS1 is an allogeneic CAR T-cell product candidate targeting CS1 and is being evaluated in patients with r/r MM in the MELANI-01 Phase 1 dose-escalation clinical study.To accelerate the speed of enrollment of patients in the MELANI-01 study  the Company would have had to invest meaningful amount of resources. To optimize its resources  the Company decided to focus its development efforts on the BALLI-01  AMELI-01 and NATHALI-01 studies and therefore to stop enrollment and treatment of patients in the MELANI-01 study.Research Data & Preclinical ProgramsTALEN®-edited MUC1 CAR T-cellsOn April 17  Cellectis released preclinical data on TALEN®-edited MUC1 CAR T-cells at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting 2023.The preclinical data presented in a poster showed the capability of armored allogeneic MUC1 CAR T-cells to excel in the immune suppressive tumor micro-environment suggesting that they could be an effective option in treating relapsed and refractory triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients with limited therapeutic options.Poster of the presentation is available on Cellectis’ website: https://www.cellectis.com/en/investors/scientific-presentations/Multiplex engineering for superior generation of efficient CAR T-cellsOn May 17  2023  Cellectis will present preclinical data on multiplex engineering for superior generation of CAR T-cells  at the American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy (ASGCT) 2023 Annual Meeting. Details from the presentation will be available following the event on the Cellectis website at: https://www.cellectis.com/en/investors/scientific-presentations/Licensed Allogeneic CAR T-cell Development ProgramsServier and Allogene: anti-CD19 programsAllogene continues to enroll patients in the industry’s first potentially pivotal Phase 2 allogeneic CAR T clinical trial with ALLO-501A. Allogene announced that the single-arm ALPHA2 trial will enroll approximately 100 r/r large B cell lymphoma (LBCL) patients who have received at least two prior lines of therapy and have not received prior anti-CD19 therapy. Allogene expects to complete enrollment in H1 2024.After the close of the quarter  Allogene announced that pooled data from the Phase 1 ALPHA/ALPHA2 trials of ALLO-501/501A  in r/r LBCL would be presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting June 2 – 6  2023 in Chicago  Illinois.Allogene: anti-BCMA and anti-CD70 programsAllogene presented interim data from its Phase 1 TRAVERSE trial of ALLO-316  its first investigational product candidate for solid tumors  during an oral presentation at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting in April. The ongoing dose escalation study is enrolling patients with advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who have progressed on standard therapies that included an immune checkpoint inhibitor and a VEGF-targeting therapy. The data reported to date is primarily from the DL1 and DL2 cohorts.Anti-tumor activity was primarily observed in patients with tumors confirmed to express CD70 (N=10). Among 18 patients evaluable for efficacy  the disease control rate (DCR) was 89%. In the 10 patients whose tumors were known to express CD70  the disease control rate was 100%  which included three patients who achieved partial remission (two confirmed  one unconfirmed). The longest response lasted until month eight. There was a trend toward greater tumor shrinkage in patients with higher levels of CD70 expression. In patients evaluable for safety (N=19)  ALLO-316 demonstrated an adverse event profile generally consistent with autologous CAR T therapies.Dose escalation in the TRAVERSE trial is expected to be completed in 2023.During the quarter  data from the Phase 1 UNIVERSAL trial with ALLO-715 for the treatment of r/r multiple myeloma (MM) was published in Nature Medicine. UNIVERSAL is the first allogeneic anti-BCMA CAR T to demonstrate proof-of-concept in MM with response rates that are similar to an approved autologous CAR T therapy. Allogene is evaluating manufacturing processes improvements across its BCMA candidates to achieve optimal performance.PartnershipsCytovia Therapeutics  Inc.

Under the terms of the Merger Agreement  Calyxt will issue shares of its common stock to Cibus shareholders in an exchange ratio such that upon completion of the merger  Calyxt shareholders are expected to own approximately 5% of the combined company  subject to adjustments permitted by the Merger Agreement. The Boards of Directors of both companies unanimously approved the Calyxt Merger. Concurrent with the execution of the merger agreement  certain officers of Calyxt  all of Calyxt’s directors  and Cellectis executed support agreements in favor of the Calyxt Merger. On March 1  2023  as stated in the Merger Agreement  Calyxy’s Board authorized the grant of 3 487 503 RSUs to all employees. These awards will vest upon completion of the Transactions  and accordingly  the expense associated with these awards will be recognized over the period from the date of grant to the estimated closing date of the Transactions. Consequently  after the completion of the Transaction  and subject to the issuance of some or all of such RSUs  Cellectis will own approximately 2.4% of Calyxt.Cellectis currently holds a 48.2 % equity interest in Calyxt. Following the closing of the merger  Cellectis is expected to own approximately 2.4% of the equity interests of the combined company.Warrant agreement with the European Investment BankOn April 4  Cellectis announced it entered into the warrant agreement (the “Warrant Agreement”) and finalized the related ancillary documents required under the credit facility with the European Investment Bank (“EIB”) for up to €40 million previously announced on December 28  2022. The Company also announced the drawdown of the first tranche of €20 million (“Tranche A”) under the Finance Contract  that has been disbursed by the EIB in early April 2023.Cellectis plans to use the proceeds of Tranche A towards the development of its pipeline of allogeneic CAR T-cell product candidates: UCART22  UCART20x22  UCART123.Financial resultsThe interim condensed consolidated financial statements of Cellectis  which consolidate the results of Calyxt  Inc. of which Cellectis owned approximately 48.2% of outstanding shares of common stock (as of March 31  2023)  have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards  as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IFRS”).We present certain financial metrics broken out between our two reportable segments – Therapeutics and Plants – in the appendices of this Q1 2023 financial results press release.On January 13  2023  Calyxt  Cibus Global LLC (Cibus) and certain other parties named therein  entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”)  pursuant to which  subject to the terms and conditions thereof  Calyxt and Cibus will merge in an all-stock transaction (the “Calyxt Merger”). As a consequence of the foregoing  Calyxt meets the “held-for-sale"" criteria specified in IFRS 5 and has been classified as a discontinued operation.Cash: As of March 31  2023  Cellectis  excluding Calyxt  had $88 million in consolidated cash  cash equivalents  and restricted cash. This compares to $95 million in consolidated cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash as of December 31  2022. This difference mainly reflects $30 million of cash out  which include $6 million of payments for R&D expenses  $4 million for SG&A suppliers  $15 million for staff costs  $4 million for rents and taxes  $1 million of reimbursement of the “PGE” loan and a $23 million net cash inflow from the capital raise closed in February.Based on the current operating plan  Cellectis (excluding Calyxt) anticipates that the cash and cash equivalents as of March 31  2023 will fund Cellectis’ operations into the third quarter of 2024.Revenues and Other Income: Consolidated revenues and other income were $3.6 million for the three months ended March 31  2023 compared to $3.8 million for the three months ended March 31  2022. The slight decrease of $0.2 million between the three months ended March 31  2023  and 2022 reflects the recognition of two milestones related to Cellectis’ agreement with Cytovia for $1.5 million in 2022 while recognition of revenues in 2023 is not material and was almost fully offset by an increase of the research tax credit for $1.0 million in addition to the recognition of a BPI R&D grant of $0.3 million.R&D Expenses: Consolidated R&D expenses were $21.1 million three months ended March 31  2023 compared to $26.6 million for the three months ended March 31  2022. The $5.5 million decrease was primarily attributable to (i) a $2.6 million decrease in personal expenses due to departures not replaced (ii) a $3.0 million decrease in purchases  external expenses and other (from $13.8 million in 2022 to $10.8 million in 2023) mainly explained by internalization of our manufacturing and quality activities to support our R&D pipeline.SG&A Expenses: Consolidated SG&A expenses were $5.0 million for the three months ended March 31  2023 compared to $6.1 million for the three months ended March 31  2022. The $1.1 million decrease primarily reflects (i) a $0.9 million decrease in purchases  external expenses and other (from $3.7 million in 2022 to $2.9 million in 2023) mainly explained by the implementation of our new enterprise resource planning (ERP) software in 2022 (ii) a $0.2 million decrease in personal expenses.Net income (loss) from discontinued operations: The $1.7 million decrease of net loss from discontinued operations between the three-month period ended March 31  2022 and 2023 is primarily driven by (i) the decrease of $2.6 million of R&D expenses (from $3.2 million in 2022 to $1.3 in 2023) and SG&A expenses (from $2.9 million in 2022 to $2.2 million in 2023) partially offset by (i) the increase of $0.7 million of net financial loss and (ii) the increase of $0.2 million of other operating expenses.Net Income (loss) Attributable to Shareholders of Cellectis including Calyxt: The consolidated net loss attributable to shareholders of Cellectis was $30.1 million (or $0.58 per share) for the three months ended March 31  2023  of which $27.8 million was attributed to Cellectis continuing operations  compared to $31.9 million (or $0.70 per share) for the three months ended March 31  2022  of which $28.3 million was attributed to Cellectis continuing operations. This $1.8 million decrease in net loss between the three months of 2023 and 2022 was primarily driven by (i) a $5.3 million decrease of research and development  (ii) a decrease of $1.7 million of loss from discontinued operations  (iii) a $1.3 million decrease of SG&A expenses partially offset by (i) an increase in net financial loss of $5.3 million primarily due to the decrease of the fair value of Cytovia’s convertible note on March 31  2023 of $4.6 million compared to a $7.9 million on December 31  2022  (ii) a decrease of $0.2 million of revenues and other income  (iii) an increase of other operating expenses of $0.6 million  (iv) a decrease of $0.4 million in loss attributable to non-controlling interests due to the decrease in Calyxt’s net loss.Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Shareholders of Cellectis: The consolidated adjusted net loss attributable to shareholders of Cellectis was $28.1 million (or $0.55 per share) for the three months ended March 31  2023  of which $26.2 million is attributed to Cellectis  compared to a net loss of $29.3 million (or $0.64 per share) for the three months ended March 31  2022  of which $26.0 million was attributed to Cellectis.Please see “Note Regarding Use of Non-IFRS Financial Measures” for reconciliation of GAAP net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis to adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis.We currently foresee focusing our cash spending at Cellectis for 2023 in the following areas:Supporting the development of our pipeline of product candidates  including the manufacturing and clinical trial expenses of UCART123  UCART22  UCART 20x22 and potential new product candidates  andOperating our state-of-the-art manufacturing capabilities in Paris (France)  and Raleigh (North Carolina  USA); andContinuing strengthening our manufacturing and clinical departments.CELLECTIS S.A.

Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis is not a measure calculated in accordance with IFRS. We have included in this press release a reconciliation of this figure to net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis  which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with IFRS. Because adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis excludes Non-cash stock-based compensation expense—a non-cash expense  we believe that this financial measure  when considered together with our IFRS financial statements  can enhance an overall understanding of Cellectis’ financial performance. Moreover  our management views the Company’s operations  and manages its business  based  in part  on this financial measure. In particular  we believe that the elimination of Non-cash stock-based expenses from Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core businesses. Our use of adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis has limitations as an analytical tool  and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under IFRS. Some of these limitations are: (a) other companies  including companies in our industry which use similar stock-based compensation  may address the impact of Non-cash stock- based compensation expense differently; and (b) other companies may report adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders or similarly titled measures but calculate them differently  which reduces their usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these and other limitations  you should consider adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis alongside our IFRS financial results  including Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis.RECONCILIATION OF IFRS TO NON-IFRS NET INCOME – First Quarter (unaudited) ($ in thousands  except per share data) For the three-month period ended March 31  2022 * 2023 Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis (31 911 ) (30 074 ) Adjustment: Non-cash stock-based compensation expense attributable to shareholders of Cellectis 2 648 1 979 Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis (29 263 ) (28 095 ) Basic Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($/share) (0.64 ) (0.55 ) Basic adjusted earnings from discontinued operations attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($ /share) (0.07 ) (0.04 ) Weighted average number of outstanding shares  basic (units) 45 486 477 51 452 348 Diluted Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($/share) (0.64 ) (0.55 ) Diluted Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($/share) from discontinued operations (0.07 ) (0.04 ) Weighted average number of outstanding shares  diluted (units) 45 486 477 51 452 348*These amounts reflect adjustments made in connection with the presentation of the discontinued operationAbout CellectisCellectis is a clinical-stage biotechnology company using its pioneering gene-editing platform to develop life-saving cell and gene therapies.

The patent  entitled ‘Diagnostic method for detecting the pathological correlates of chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGvHD) using particular cytokine or chemokine biomarkers’  has been submitted at the European Patent Office desk (EPO). This patent covers the use of a new quantitative method to evaluate the impact of medications destined at changing the course of the chronic form of the Graft versus Host Disease (cGvHD).In 2021  BioSenic successfully concluded a prospective national multicenter single-arm open-label Phase II study in 5 university hospital centers in France. In the trial  BioSenic treated 21 cGvHD patients with an intravenous formulation  known as Arscimed  of arsenic trioxide (ATO). BioSenic published positive safety and efficacy results in the international peer-reviewed journal Transplantation and Cellular Therapy. Subsequent analysis of patient serums now provides key data on the transition of cytokines/chemokines concentrations from an initial abnormal range of values to a normalized level  associated with reduced disease activity. Data of the post-hoc study are now available. These biomarkers will potentially help estimate the risk of developing the disease at early stages with measured levels of selected cytokines  and also to assess the therapeutic response to current standard of care or any new treatment.“BioSenic's newly submitted patent will allow the company to accelerate the development and approval of its novel therapeutic agents in cGvHD. This patent covers quantitative research tools that are needed to evaluate short-term responses to treatments and to predict long-term clinical benefits ” said Prof. François Rieger  PhD  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of BioSenic. “Regulatory agencies will be far more receptive to market approvals for treatment use of any active pharmacological ingredient if the means of quantitative monitoring of the assessment of the activity and direct staging of the disease are applicable. This patent adds to our extensive patent portfolio covering both of our therapeutic platforms. It will also be invaluable in our Phase 3 clinical trial using an oral formulation of ATO that is on target to start this year. Using this new disclosed quantitative method for the evaluation of disease activity will be a strong advantage to firmly establish the validity of any new experimental treatment.”BioSenic’s technology covered by the patent applies to a method and kit for diagnosing and monitoring cGvHD in an individual who has undergone an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The patent describes biomarkers to be used to determine if the condition of a patient worsens or improves following standard or new treatments for cGvHD. This quantitative set of evaluations consists of determining the kinetics levels of selected  meaningful cytokines in an individual's blood sample. Such quantitative assessments of cGvHD can further guide clinical decisions and can help to analyze the outcome of endpoints in clinical trials. This industrial biomarker kit could generate a global turnover of EUR 30 to 40 million as more than 15 000 patients are treated for cGvHD each year.About BioSenicBioSenic is a leading biotech company specializing in the development of clinical assets issued from: (i)  the allogeneic cell therapy platform ALLOB and (ii) the Arsenic TriOxide (ATO) platform. Key target indications for the platforms include Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD)  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) and high-risk tibial fractures.Following the merger in October 2022  BioSenic combines the strategic positionings and strengths of Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics. The merger also enables Biosenic to add to its innovative cell therapy platform and strong IP for tissue repair protection with an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/OATO.BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About BioSenic technology platformsBioSenic’s technology is based on two main platforms:1) The allogeneic cell and gene therapy platform  developed by BioSenic with differentiated bone marrow sourced Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) that can be stored at the point of use in hospitals. Its current investigational medicinal product  ALLOB  represents a unique  proprietary approach to organ repair and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells on the site of injury after a single local injection. These cells are produced via a BioSenic's scalable manufacturing process. Following the CTA approval by regulatory authorities in Europe  BioSenic has initiated patient recruitment for the Phase IIb clinical trial with ALLOB in patients with difficult tibial fractures  using its optimized production process. ALLOB is currently being evaluated in a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase IIb study in patients with high-risk tibial fractures  using its optimized production process  after a successful first safety and efficacy study (Phase 1/2a) on fractured long bones  with late delayed union. The patient recruitment has been halted late February 2023 with 57 patients and the new rules permitted for statistical analysis should allow BioSenic to get the main results of this trial much earlier than anticipated in the original protocol  since they are expected by mid-2023.2) The Arsenic TriOxide (ATO) platform developed by Medsenic. The immunomodulatory properties of ATO have demonstrated a double basic effect on cells of the immune system. The first effect is the increase of the cell oxidative stress in activated B  T or other cells of the innate/adaptative immune system to the point they will enter a cell death program (apoptosis) and be eliminated. The second effect is potent immunomodulatory properties on several pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in inflammatory or autoimmune cell pathways. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. GvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). GvHD is primarily mediated by the transplanted immune system that can lead to severe multiorgan damage. Medsenic had been successful in a Phase II trial with its intravenous formulation  allowing arsenic trioxide to be granted an orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA and is heading towards an international Phase III confirmatory study  with a new  IP protected  oral (OATO) formulation. Moderate to Severe forms of Systemic Lupus erythematosus (SLE) is another selected target  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastro-intestinal tract) in a Phase IIa study.Systemic Sclerosis is  in addition  part of the clinical pipeline of BioSenic. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive. This gives good grounds to launch a Phase II clinical protocol for this serious disease that badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and with no actual current effective treatment.In addition  BioSenic is developing an off-the-shelf next-generation improved viscosupplement  JTA-004  consisting of a unique combination of plasma proteins  hyaluronic acid - a natural component of knee synovial fluid  and a fast-acting analgesic. JTA-004 intends to provide added lubrication and protection to the cartilage of the arthritic joint and to alleviate osteoarthritic pain (OA) and inflammation. In March 2023  after the identification of new OA subtypes  BioSenic delivered a new post-hoc analysis of its Phase III JTA-004 trial on knee OA with positive action on the most severely affected patient population. This new post-hoc analysis changes the therapeutic profile of the molecule and potentially allows for the possibility of stratifying patients for a new  optimized Phase III clinical study. BioSenic  which does not intend to allocate R&D resources to support the clinical development of JTA-004 and will continue to focus its R&D activities on the development of its autoimmune (ATO) and cell therapy (ALLOB) platforms  is now seeking to collaborate with existing and potential partners to explore options for the future development of JTA-004 based on this new post-hoc analysis.,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.27,0.26,0.47,True,English,"['key biomarkers', 'BioSenic', 'cGvHD', 'patent', 'EPO', 'prospective national multicenter single-arm open-label Phase II study', 'allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'Prof. François Rieger', 'international peer-reviewed journal Transplantation', 'current investigational medicinal product', 'innovative cell therapy platform', 'European Patent Office desk', 'allogeneic cell therapy platform', 'industrial biomarker analysis kit', 'Phase 3 clinical trial', 'industrial biomarker kit', 'gene therapy platform', '5 university hospital centers', 'initial abnormal range', 'Chief Executive Officer', 'active pharmacological ingredient', 'high-risk tibial fractures', 'Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park', 'unique, proprietary approach', 'Mesenchymal Stromal Cells', 'undifferentiated stromal cells', 'quantitative research tools', 'long-term clinical benefits', 'Such quantitative assessments', 'Systemic lupus erythematosus', 'novel therapeutic agents', 'leading biotech company', 'tissue repair protection', 'differentiated bone marrow', 'two main platforms', 'clinical stage company', 'extensive patent portfolio', 'chronic graft-versus-host disease', 'Key target indications', 'new experimental treatment', 'reduced disease activity', 'post-hoc study', 'new quantitative method', 'cell repair', 'Cellular Therapy', 'BioSenic technology platforms', 'Subsequent analysis', 'bone-forming cells', 'International patent', 'therapeutic platforms', 'ATO platform', 'chronic form', 'current standard', 'quantitative monitoring', 'quantitative set', 'clinical decisions', 'clinical trials', 'clinical assets', 'ATO) platform', 'Systemic Sclerosis', 'therapeutic response', 'Bone Therapeutics', 'organ repair', 'bone regeneration', 'new treatment', 'new arsenal', 'Euronext Brussels', 'serious autoimmune', 'inflammatory diseases', 'Diagnostic method', 'pathological correlates', 'particular cytokine', 'intravenous formulation', 'arsenic trioxide', 'positive safety', 'efficacy results', 'cytokines/chemokines concentrations', 'normalized level', 'early stages', 'short-term responses', 'Regulatory agencies', 'market approvals', 'direct staging', 'oral formulation', 'strong advantage', 'blood sample', '30 to 40 million', 'strategic positionings', 'strong IP', 'various anti-inflammatory', 'anti-autoimmune formulations', 'immunomodulatory properties', 'Further information', 'healthy donors', 'key patent', 'key data', 'patient serums', 'kinetics levels', 'meaningful cytokines', 'global turnover', 'chemokine biomarkers', '21 cGvHD patients', 'treatments', '15,000 patients', 'development', 'Mont-Saint-Guibert', 'Belgium', 'Paris', 'submission', 'use', 'EPO', 'impact', 'medications', 'course', 'France', 'Arscimed', 'transition', 'values', 'care', 'PhD', 'Chairman', 'means', 'evaluation', 'validity', 'diagnosing', 'individual', 'condition', 'outcome', 'endpoints', 'ALLOB', 'SLE', 'SSc', 'merger', 'October', 'strengths', 'Medsenic', 'ATO/OATO', 'MSCs', 'hospitals', 'site', 'injury']",2023-05-04,2023-05-04,pharmiweb.com
