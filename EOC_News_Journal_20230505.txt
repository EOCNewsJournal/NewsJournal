In this announcement “Shell”  “Shell Group” and “Group” are sometimes used for convenience where references are made to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general. Likewise  the words “we”  “us” and “our” are also used to refer to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general or to those who work for them. These terms are also used where no useful purpose is served by identifying the particular entity or entities. ‘‘Subsidiaries’’  “Shell subsidiaries” and “Shell companies” as used in this announcement refer to entities over which Shell plc either directly or indirectly has control. Entities and unincorporated arrangements over which Shell has joint control are generally referred to as “joint ventures” and “joint operations”  respectively. “Joint ventures” and “joint operations” are collectively referred to as “joint arrangements”. Entities over which Shell has significant influence but neither control nor joint control are referred to as “associates”. The term “Shell interest” is used for convenience to indicate the direct and/or indirect ownership interest held by Shell in an entity or unincorporated joint arrangement  after exclusion of all third-party interest.Forward-Looking StatementsThis announcement contains forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) concerning the financial condition  results of operations and businesses of Shell. All statements other than statements of historical fact are  or may be deemed to be  forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management’s current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking statements include  among other things  statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management’s expectations  beliefs  estimates  forecasts  projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as “aim”  “ambition”  ‘‘anticipate’’  ‘‘believe’’  ‘‘could’’  ‘‘estimate’’  ‘‘expect’’  ‘‘goals’’  ‘‘intend’’  ‘‘may’’  “milestones”  ‘‘objectives’’  ‘‘outlook’’  ‘‘plan’’  ‘‘probably’’  ‘‘project’’  ‘‘risks’’  “schedule”  ‘‘seek’’  ‘‘should’’  ‘‘target’’  ‘‘will’’ and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this announcement  including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell’s products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets  and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative  judicial  fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks  including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities  delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics  such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak; and (n) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this announcement are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc’s Form 20-F for the year ended December 31  2022 (available at www.shell.com/investor and www.sec.gov). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this announcement and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement  May 4  2023. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information  future events or other information. In light of these risks  results could differ materially from those stated  implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this announcement.Shell’s net carbon intensityAlso  in this announcement we may refer to Shell’s “Net Carbon Intensity”  which includes Shell’s carbon emissions from the production of our energy products  our suppliers’ carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers’ carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the term Shell’s “Net Carbon Intensity” is for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.Shell’s net-Zero Emissions TargetShell’s operating plan  outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly  they reflect our Scope 1  Scope 2 and Net Carbon Intensity (NCI) targets over the next ten years. However  Shell’s operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target and 2035 NCI target  as these targets are currently outside our planning period. In the future  as society moves towards net-zero emissions  we expect Shell’s operating plans to reflect this movement. However  if society is not net zero in 2050  as of today  there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.Forward Looking Non-GAAP measuresThis announcement may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as cash capital expenditure and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell  such as oil and gas prices  interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover  estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc’s consolidated financial statements.The contents of websites referred to in this announcement do not form part of this announcement.We may have used certain terms  such as resources  in this announcement that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC.

In this announcement “Shell”  “Shell Group” and “Group” are sometimes used for convenience where references are made to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general. Likewise  the words “we”  “us” and “our” are also used to refer to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general or to those who work for them. These terms are also used where no useful purpose is served by identifying the particular entity or entities. ‘‘Subsidiaries’’  “Shell subsidiaries” and “Shell companies” as used in this announcement refer to entities over which Shell plc either directly or indirectly has control. Entities and unincorporated arrangements over which Shell has joint control are generally referred to as “joint ventures” and “joint operations”  respectively. “Joint ventures” and “joint operations” are collectively referred to as “joint arrangements”. Entities over which Shell has significant influence but neither control nor joint control are referred to as “associates”. The term “Shell interest” is used for convenience to indicate the direct and/or indirect ownership interest held by Shell in an entity or unincorporated joint arrangement  after exclusion of all third-party interest.Forward-Looking StatementsThis announcement contains forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) concerning the financial condition  results of operations and businesses of Shell. All statements other than statements of historical fact are  or may be deemed to be  forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management’s current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking statements include  among other things  statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management’s expectations  beliefs  estimates  forecasts  projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as “aim”  “ambition”  ‘‘anticipate’’  ‘‘believe’’  ‘‘could’’  ‘‘estimate’’  ‘‘expect’’  ‘‘goals’’  ‘‘intend’’  ‘‘may’’  “milestones”  ‘‘objectives’’  ‘‘outlook’’  ‘‘plan’’  ‘‘probably’’  ‘‘project’’  ‘‘risks’’  “schedule”  ‘‘seek’’  ‘‘should’’  ‘‘target’’  ‘‘will’’ and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this announcement  including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell’s products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets  and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative  judicial  fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks  including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities  delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics  such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak; and (n) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this announcement are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc’s Form 20-F for the year ended December 31  2022 (available at www.shell.com/investor and www.sec.gov). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this announcement and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement  May 4  2023. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information  future events or other information. In light of these risks  results could differ materially from those stated  implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this announcement.Shell’s net carbon intensityAlso  in this announcement we may refer to Shell’s “Net Carbon Intensity”  which includes Shell’s carbon emissions from the production of our energy products  our suppliers’ carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers’ carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the term Shell’s “Net Carbon Intensity” is for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.Shell’s net-Zero Emissions TargetShell’s operating plan  outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly  they reflect our Scope 1  Scope 2 and Net Carbon Intensity (NCI) targets over the next ten years. However  Shell’s operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target and 2035 NCI target  as these targets are currently outside our planning period. In the future  as society moves towards net-zero emissions  we expect Shell’s operating plans to reflect this movement. However  if society is not net zero in 2050  as of today  there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.Forward Looking Non-GAAP measuresThis announcement may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as cash capital expenditure and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell  such as oil and gas prices  interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover  estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc’s consolidated financial statements.The contents of websites referred to in this announcement do not form part of this announcement.We may have used certain terms  such as resources  in this announcement that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC.

In 2022  Suominen’s comparable EBITDA was EUR 15.3 million.Tommi Björnman  President & CEO:“For Suominen the beginning of 2023 has been challenging. Even though the raw material prices started to decline in the first quarter of 2023  they are still significantly higher than in the comparison period. Our net sales were EUR 116.8 million (110.3) in the first quarter. Sales prices increased and sales volumes were at the same level as in the comparison period despite the strikes in the Finnish ports and at our Mozzate plant in Italy.Our quarterly EBITDA declined to EUR 2.6 million (3.3). Our raw material costs increased more than the sales prices which react to the cost increases with a lag due to our price mechanism.Story continuesIn January 2023 we started a consultation procedure regarding a plan to permanently close manufacturing at our Mozzate plant in Italy. The consultation procedure has now been concluded and the production at Mozzate ended in April 2023.As the frontrunner in sustainable nonwovens Suominen organized a Sustainability & New Fiber Seminar in Nakkila at end of February 2023. The Seminar gathered around fifty participants from across the nonwoven production value chain and received excellent feedback. Our innovation and sustainability work was also recognized as our HYDRASPUN® Circula won EDANA’s INDEX™23 Award at INDEX™23 exhibition showcasing how innovation and sustainability are driving the nonwovens industry forward.The near future continues to look challenging and the competition is fierce. The market remains unstable  and the same applies to raw material  energy and freight costs. However  we are more optimistic about the second half of the year. The raw material prices declined in Q1/2023 from the previous quarter (Q4/2022) and we are seeing signs that the raw material prices remain close to Q1/2023 level in the foreseeable future. It remains to be seen how the current economic climate impacts the end consumer demand and consumer preferences regarding wipes. Historically  the wipes market has been rather steady despite the general economic situation. All in all  we expect that our comparable EBITDA in 2023 will increase from 2022.I am happy to join Suominen and work together with the team to repositioning the company toward a profitable growth journey.”NET SALESIn January–March 2023  Suominen’s net sales increased by 6% from the comparison period to EUR 116.8 million (110.3). Sales volumes were on the same level as in Q1/2022 despite the strikes in the Finnish ports and at our Mozzate plant in Italy. Sales prices increased following the higher raw material prices. Currencies impacted net sales positively by EUR 3.4 million.Suominen has two business areas  Americas and Europe. Net sales of the Americas business area were EUR 75.0 million (61.7) and net sales of the Europe business area were EUR 41.8 million (48.5).EBITDA  OPERATING PROFIT AND RESULTEBITDA (earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization) declined to EUR 2.6 million (3.3). Our raw material costs increased more than the sales prices which react to the cost increases with a lag due to our price mechanism.

He will start latest in June 2023.SHORT TERM RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIESRegarding the war in Ukraine  the direct impact to Suominen’s business is minor as we have no customers nor suppliers in Russia  Belarus or Ukraine. Suominen as a company is mostly affected by the indirect economic impacts of the war.Suominen’s other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to: risks related to manufacturing  competition  raw material prices and availability  customer specific volumes and credits  changes in legislation  political environment or economic conditions and investments  and financial risks.A more detailed description of risks is available in Suominen’s Annual Report 2022 at suominen.fi/investors.BUSINESS ENVIRONMENTSuominen’s nonwovens are  for the most part  used in daily consumer goods  such as wipes as well as in hygiene and medical products. In these target markets of Suominen  the general economic situation determines the development of consumer demand  even though the demand for consumer goods is not very cyclical in nature. North America and Europe are the largest market areas for Suominen. In addition  the company operates in the South American markets. The growth in the demand for nonwovens has typically exceeded the growth of gross domestic product by a couple of percentage points.The near future continues to look challenging and the competition is fierce. The market remains unstable  and the same applies to raw material  energy and freight costs. However  we are more optimistic about the second half of the year. The raw material prices declined in Q1/2023 from the previous quarter (Q4/2022) and we are seeing signs that the raw material prices remain close to Q1/2023 level in the foreseeable future. It remains to be seen how the current economic climate impacts the end consumer demand and consumer preferences regarding wipes. Historically  the wipes market has been rather steady despite the general economic situation.OUTLOOK FOR 2023Suominen expects that its comparable EBITDA (earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization) in 2023 will increase from 2022. In 2022  Suominen’s comparable EBITDA was EUR 15.3 million.EVENTS AFTER THE REPORTING PERIODSuominen has completed the consultation procedure concerning its plan to permanently close manufacturing at its Mozzate plant in Italy (April 14  2023)Suominen announced on January 10  2023 that it will start consultation with local trade unions regarding a plan to permanently close manufacturing at its Mozzate plant.

in Finland or alternative performance measures (cash flow from operations per share).Some of the other key ratios Suominen publishes are alternative performance measures. An alternative performance measure is a key ratio which has not been defined in IFRS standards. Suominen believes that the use of alternative performance measures provides useful information for example to investors regarding the Group's financial and operating performance and makes it easier to make comparisons between the reporting periods.The link between the components of the key ratios per share and the consolidated financial statements is presented in the consolidated financial statements of 2022. The link between the components of the alternative performance measures and the consolidated financial statements is presented in Suominen’s Annual Report for 2022.Calculation of key ratios per shareEarnings per shareBasic earnings per share (EPS)Profit for the period. net of tax = Share-issue adjusted average number of shares excluding treasury sharesDiluted earnings per share (EPS)Profit for the period = Average diluted share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury sharesEUR thousand 31.3.2023 31.3.2022 31.12.2022 Profit for the period -3 949 -2 336 -13 863 Average share-issue adjusted number of shares 57 554 532 57 323 494 57 439 615 Average diluted share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury shares 57 680 202 57 419 946 57 533 196 Earnings per share EUR Basic -0.07 -0.04 -0.24 Diluted -0.07 -0.04 -0.24Cash flow from operations per shareCash flow from operations per shareCash flow from operations = Share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury shares. end of reporting period31.3.2023 31.3.2022 31.12.2022 Cash flow from operations  EUR thousand 3 269 -2 679 14 027 Share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury shares  end of reporting period 57 670 510 57 462 142 57 480 727 Cash flow from operations per share  EUR 0.06 -0.05 0.24Equity per shareEquity per shareTotal equity attributable to owners of the parent = Share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury shares. end of reporting period31.3.2023 31.3.2022 31.12.2022 Total equity attributable to owners of the parent  EUR thousand 140 131 153 504 145 916 Share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury shares  end of reporting period 57 670 510 57 462 142 57 480 727 Equity per share  EUR 2.43 2.67 2.54Market capitalizationMarket capitalization = Number of shares at the end of reporting period excluding treasury shares x share price at the end of period31.3.2023 31.3.2022 31.12.2022 Number of shares at the end of reporting period excluding treasury shares 57 670 510 57 462 142 57 480 727 Share price at end of the period  EUR 3.03 3.55 3.00 Market capitalization  EUR million 174.7 204.0 172.4Share turnoverShare turnover = The proportion of number of shares traded during the period to weighted average number of shares excluding treasury shares31.3.2023 31.3.2022 31.12.2022 Number of shares traded during the period 346 667 7 195 433 10 902 032 Average number of shares excluding treasury shares 57 554 532 57 323 494 57 439 615 Share turnover  % 0.6 12.6 19.0Calculation of key ratios and alternative performance measuresOperating profit and comparable operating profitOperating profit (EBIT) = Profit before income taxes + net financial expenses Comparable operating profit (EBIT) = Profit before income taxes + net financial expenses. adjusted with items affecting comparabilityIn order to improve the comparability of result between reporting periods. Suominen presents comparable operating profit as an alternative performance measure. Operating profit is adjusted with material items that are considered to affect comparability between reporting periods. These items include  among others  impairment losses or reversals of impairment losses  gains or losses from the sales of property  plant and equipment or intangible assets or other assets and restructuring costs.Comparable EBITEUR thousand 31.3.2023 31.3.2022 31.12.2022 Operating profit -2 093 -1 268 -8 958 + Impairment losses of property  plant and equipment  affecting comparability of result − − 2 288 + Impairment losses of right-of-use assets  affecting comparability of result 108 − 1 536 + Impairment losses of inventories  affecting comparability of result − − 971 Comparable operating profit -1 985 -1 268 -4 163EBITDA and comparable EBITDAEBITDA is an important measure that focuses on the operating performance excluding the effect of depreciation and amortization  financial items and income taxes  in other words what is the margin on net sales after deducting operating expenses.EBITDA = EBIT + depreciation  amortization and impairment lossesComparable EBITDA = EBIT + depreciation  amortization and impairment losses  adjusted with items affecting comparabilityEBITDA EUR thousand 31.3.2023 31.3.2022 31.12.2022 Operating profit -2 093 -1 268 -8 958 + Depreciation  amortization and impairment losses 4 741 4 566 23 245 EBITDA 2 648 3 298 14 287Comparable EBITDA EBITDA 2 648 3 298 14 287 + Impairment losses of inventories  affecting comparability of result − − 971 Comparable EBITDA 2 648 3 298 15 257Gross capital expenditureEUR thousand 31.3.2023 31.3.2022 31.12.2022 Increases in intangible assets 49 261 438 Increases in property  plant and equipment 1 489 1 508 9 275 Gross capital expenditure 1 538 1 768 9 713Interest-bearing net debtIt is the opinion of Suominen that presenting interest-bearing liabilities not only at amortized cost but also at nominal value gives relevant additional information to the investors.Interest-bearing net debt = Interest-bearing liabilities at nominal value -

In 2022  Suominen’s comparable EBITDA was EUR 15.3 million.Tommi Björnman  President & CEO:“For Suominen the beginning of 2023 has been challenging. Even though the raw material prices started to decline in the first quarter of 2023  they are still significantly higher than in the comparison period. Our net sales were EUR 116.8 million (110.3) in the first quarter. Sales prices increased and sales volumes were at the same level as in the comparison period despite the strikes in the Finnish ports and at our Mozzate plant in Italy.Our quarterly EBITDA declined to EUR 2.6 million (3.3). Our raw material costs increased more than the sales prices which react to the cost increases with a lag due to our price mechanism.In January 2023 we started a consultation procedure regarding a plan to permanently close manufacturing at our Mozzate plant in Italy. The consultation procedure has now been concluded and the production at Mozzate ended in April 2023.As the frontrunner in sustainable nonwovens Suominen organized a Sustainability & New Fiber Seminar in Nakkila at end of February 2023. The Seminar gathered around fifty participants from across the nonwoven production value chain and received excellent feedback. Our innovation and sustainability work was also recognized as our HYDRASPUN® Circula won EDANA’s INDEX™23 Award at INDEX™23 exhibition showcasing how innovation and sustainability are driving the nonwovens industry forward.The near future continues to look challenging and the competition is fierce. The market remains unstable  and the same applies to raw material  energy and freight costs. However  we are more optimistic about the second half of the year. The raw material prices declined in Q1/2023 from the previous quarter (Q4/2022) and we are seeing signs that the raw material prices remain close to Q1/2023 level in the foreseeable future. It remains to be seen how the current economic climate impacts the end consumer demand and consumer preferences regarding wipes. Historically  the wipes market has been rather steady despite the general economic situation. All in all  we expect that our comparable EBITDA in 2023 will increase from 2022.I am happy to join Suominen and work together with the team to repositioning the company toward a profitable growth journey.”NET SALESIn January–March 2023  Suominen’s net sales increased by 6% from the comparison period to EUR 116.8 million (110.3). Sales volumes were on the same level as in Q1/2022 despite the strikes in the Finnish ports and at our Mozzate plant in Italy. Sales prices increased following the higher raw material prices. Currencies impacted net sales positively by EUR 3.4 million.Suominen has two business areas  Americas and Europe. Net sales of the Americas business area were EUR 75.0 million (61.7) and net sales of the Europe business area were EUR 41.8 million (48.5).EBITDA  OPERATING PROFIT AND RESULTEBITDA (earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization) declined to EUR 2.6 million (3.3). Our raw material costs increased more than the sales prices which react to the cost increases with a lag due to our price mechanism. The positive impact from currencies on EBITDA was EUR 0.1 million.Comparable operating profit decreased to EUR -2.0 million (-1.3). Operating profit was EUR -2.1 million (-1.3). Items affecting comparability were EUR -0.1 million  consisting of impairment of assets in Italy related to the planned closure of Mozzate production.Result before income taxes was EUR -3.6 million (-2.2)  and result for the reporting period was EUR -3.9 million (-2.3).FINANCINGThe Group’s net interest-bearing liabilities at nominal value amounted to EUR 54.8 million (53.8) at the end of the review period. The gearing ratio was 39.1% (35.0%) and the equity ratio 42.5% (39.8%).In January–March  net financial expenses were EUR -1.5 million (-0.9)  or -1.3% (-0.8%) of net sales. Fluctuations in exchange rates increased the net financial items by EUR 0.3 million. In the comparison period the fluctuations in exchange rates decreased the net financial items by EUR 0.7 million.Cash flow from operations was EUR 3.3 million (-2.7)  representing a cash flow per share of EUR 0.06 (-0.05). The improvement in the cash flow from operations was mainly due to the change in net in working capital  as EUR 3.1 million was released from the working capital (in Q1 2022: tied up additional EUR 4.3 million).CAPITAL EXPENDITUREThe gross capital expenditure totaled EUR 1.5 million (1.8) and was mainly related to normal maintenance investments as well as to the upgrading of one of the production lines in Nakkila  Finland.Depreciation  amortization for the review period amounted to EUR 4.6 million (4.6) and impairment losses EUR 0.1 million.PROGRESS IN SUSTAINABILITYWe have strong focus on safety and accident prevention  and our long-term target is to have zero lost time accidents.

We continue implementing a globally harmonized performance and development process for our blue-collar employees globally.We are committed to continuously improving our production efficiency and the efficient utilization of natural resources. In the first quarter we continued our active measures towards our targets to reduce energy consumption  greenhouse gas emissions  water consumption and waste to landfill by 20% per ton of product by 2025 compared to the base year of 2019.We offer a comprehensive portfolio of sustainable nonwovens to our customers and we are continuously developing new and innovative solutions with a reduced environmental impact.

Suominen as a company is mostly affected by the indirect economic impacts of the war.Suominen’s other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to: risks related to manufacturing  competition  raw material prices and availability  customer specific volumes and credits  changes in legislation  political environment or economic conditions and investments  and financial risks.A more detailed description of risks is available in Suominen’s Annual Report 2022 at suominen.fi/investors.BUSINESS ENVIRONMENTSuominen’s nonwovens are  for the most part  used in daily consumer goods  such as wipes as well as in hygiene and medical products. In these target markets of Suominen  the general economic situation determines the development of consumer demand  even though the demand for consumer goods is not very cyclical in nature. North America and Europe are the largest market areas for Suominen. In addition  the company operates in the South American markets. The growth in the demand for nonwovens has typically exceeded the growth of gross domestic product by a couple of percentage points.The near future continues to look challenging and the competition is fierce. The market remains unstable  and the same applies to raw material  energy and freight costs. However  we are more optimistic about the second half of the year. The raw material prices declined in Q1/2023 from the previous quarter (Q4/2022) and we are seeing signs that the raw material prices remain close to Q1/2023 level in the foreseeable future. It remains to be seen how the current economic climate impacts the end consumer demand and consumer preferences regarding wipes. Historically  the wipes market has been rather steady despite the general economic situation.OUTLOOK FOR 2023Suominen expects that its comparable EBITDA (earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization) in 2023 will increase from 2022.

However  options and other special rights referred to in Chapter 10  Section 1 of the Companies Act cannot be granted as part of the company’s remuneration plan.The maximum number of new shares that may be subscribed and own shares held by the company that may be conveyed by virtue of the options and other special rights granted by the company is 5 000 000 shares in total which number is included in the maximum number stated above.The authorizations shall revoke all earlier authorizations regarding share issue and issuance of special rights entitling to shares.

in Finland or alternative performance measures (cash flow from operations per share).Some of the other key ratios Suominen publishes are alternative performance measures. An alternative performance measure is a key ratio which has not been defined in IFRS standards. Suominen believes that the use of alternative performance measures provides useful information for example to investors regarding the Group's financial and operating performance and makes it easier to make comparisons between the reporting periods.The link between the components of the key ratios per share and the consolidated financial statements is presented in the consolidated financial statements of 2022. The link between the components of the alternative performance measures and the consolidated financial statements is presented in Suominen’s Annual Report for 2022.Calculation of key ratios per shareEarnings per shareBasic earnings per share (EPS)Profit for the period. net of tax = Share-issue adjusted average number of shares excluding treasury sharesDiluted earnings per share (EPS)Profit for the period = Average diluted share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury sharesEUR thousand 31.3.2023 31.3.2022 31.12.2022 Profit for the period -3 949 -2 336 -13 863 Average share-issue adjusted number of shares 57 554 532 57 323 494 57 439 615 Average diluted share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury shares 57 680 202 57 419 946 57 533 196 Earnings per share EUR Basic -0.07 -0.04 -0.24 Diluted -0.07 -0.04 -0.24Cash flow from operations per shareCash flow from operations per shareCash flow from operations = Share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury shares. end of reporting period31.3.2023 31.3.2022 31.12.2022 Cash flow from operations  EUR thousand 3 269 -2 679 14 027 Share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury shares  end of reporting period 57 670 510 57 462 142 57 480 727 Cash flow from operations per share  EUR 0.06 -0.05 0.24Equity per shareEquity per shareTotal equity attributable to owners of the parent = Share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury shares. end of reporting period31.3.2023 31.3.2022 31.12.2022 Total equity attributable to owners of the parent  EUR thousand 140 131 153 504 145 916 Share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury shares  end of reporting period 57 670 510 57 462 142 57 480 727 Equity per share  EUR 2.43 2.67 2.54Market capitalizationMarket capitalization = Number of shares at the end of reporting period excluding treasury shares x share price at the end of period31.3.2023 31.3.2022 31.12.2022 Number of shares at the end of reporting period excluding treasury shares 57 670 510 57 462 142 57 480 727 Share price at end of the period  EUR 3.03 3.55 3.00 Market capitalization  EUR million 174.7 204.0 172.4Share turnoverShare turnover = The proportion of number of shares traded during the period to weighted average number of shares excluding treasury shares31.3.2023 31.3.2022 31.12.2022 Number of shares traded during the period 346 667 7 195 433 10 902 032 Average number of shares excluding treasury shares 57 554 532 57 323 494 57 439 615 Share turnover  % 0.6 12.6 19.0Calculation of key ratios and alternative performance measuresOperating profit and comparable operating profitOperating profit (EBIT) = Profit before income taxes + net financial expenses Comparable operating profit (EBIT) = Profit before income taxes + net financial expenses. adjusted with items affecting comparabilityIn order to improve the comparability of result between reporting periods. Suominen presents comparable operating profit as an alternative performance measure. Operating profit is adjusted with material items that are considered to affect comparability between reporting periods.

In 2022  Suominen’s comparable EBITDA was EUR 15.3 million. Tommi Björnman  President & CEO: “For Suominen the beginning of 2023 has been challenging. Even though the raw material prices started to decline in the first quarter of 2023  they are still significantly higher than in the comparison period. Our net sales were EUR 116.8 million (110.3) in the first quarter. Sales prices increased and sales volumes were at the same level as in the comparison period despite the strikes in the Finnish ports and at our Mozzate plant in Italy. Our quarterly EBITDA declined to EUR 2.6 million (3.3). Our raw material costs increased more than the sales prices which react to the cost increases with a lag due to our price mechanism. In January 2023 we started a consultation procedure regarding a plan to permanently close manufacturing at our Mozzate plant in Italy. The consultation procedure has now been concluded and the production at Mozzate ended in April 2023. As the frontrunner in sustainable nonwovens Suominen organized a Sustainability & New Fiber Seminar in Nakkila at end of February 2023. The Seminar gathered around fifty participants from across the nonwoven production value chain and received excellent feedback. Our innovation and sustainability work was also recognized as our HYDRASPUN® Circula won EDANA’s INDEX™23 Award at INDEX™23 exhibition showcasing how innovation and sustainability are driving the nonwovens industry forward. The near future continues to look challenging and the competition is fierce. The market remains unstable  and the same applies to raw material  energy and freight costs. However  we are more optimistic about the second half of the year. The raw material prices declined in Q1/2023 from the previous quarter (Q4/2022) and we are seeing signs that the raw material prices remain close to Q1/2023 level in the foreseeable future. It remains to be seen how the current economic climate impacts the end consumer demand and consumer preferences regarding wipes. Historically  the wipes market has been rather steady despite the general economic situation. All in all  we expect that our comparable EBITDA in 2023 will increase from 2022. I am happy to join Suominen and work together with the team to repositioning the company toward a profitable growth journey.”NET SALES In January–March 2023  Suominen’s net sales increased by 6% from the comparison period to EUR 116.8 million (110.3). Sales volumes were on the same level as in Q1/2022 despite the strikes in the Finnish ports and at our Mozzate plant in Italy. Sales prices increased following the higher raw material prices. Currencies impacted net sales positively by EUR 3.4 million. Suominen has two business areas  Americas and Europe. Net sales of the Americas business area were EUR 75.0 million (61.7) and net sales of the Europe business area were EUR 41.8 million (48.5).EBITDA  OPERATING PROFIT AND RESULT EBITDA (earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization) declined to EUR 2.6 million (3.3). Our raw material costs increased more than the sales prices which react to the cost increases with a lag due to our price mechanism. The positive impact from currencies on EBITDA was EUR 0.1 million. Comparable operating profit decreased to EUR -2.0 million (-1.3). Operating profit was EUR -2.1 million (-1.3). Items affecting comparability were EUR -0.1 million  consisting of impairment of assets in Italy related to the planned closure of Mozzate production. Result before income taxes was EUR -3.6 million (-2.2)  and result for the reporting period was EUR -3.9 million (-2.3).FINANCING The Group’s net interest-bearing liabilities at nominal value amounted to EUR 54.8 million (53.8) at the end of the review period. The gearing ratio was 39.1% (35.0%) and the equity ratio 42.5% (39.8%).In January–March  net financial expenses were EUR -1.5 million (-0.9)  or -1.3% (-0.8%) of net sales. Fluctuations in exchange rates increased the net financial items by EUR 0.3 million. In the comparison period the fluctuations in exchange rates decreased the net financial items by EUR 0.7 million. Cash flow from operations was EUR 3.3 million (-2.7)  representing a cash flow per share of EUR 0.06 (-0.05). The improvement in the cash flow from operations was mainly due to the change in net in working capital  as EUR 3.1 million was released from the working capital (in Q1 2022: tied up additional EUR 4.3 million).CAPITAL EXPENDITURE The gross capital expenditure totaled EUR 1.5 million (1.8) and was mainly related to normal maintenance investments as well as to the upgrading of one of the production lines in Nakkila  Finland.

In the first quarter two LTA’s occurred at Suominen sites. The employee-manager performance and development discussions  conducted in February–March  covered 97% of the white-collar employees. We continue implementing a globally harmonized performance and development process for our blue-collar employees globally. We are committed to continuously improving our production efficiency and the efficient utilization of natural resources. In the first quarter we continued our active measures towards our targets to reduce energy consumption  greenhouse gas emissions  water consumption and waste to landfill by 20% per ton of product by 2025 compared to the base year of 2019. We offer a comprehensive portfolio of sustainable nonwovens to our customers and we are continuously developing new and innovative solutions with a reduced environmental impact. Our target is a 50% increase in sales of sustainable nonwovens by 2025 compared to 2019  and to have over 10 sustainable product launches per year. Suominen reports progress in its key sustainability KPIs annually. As part of our Annual Report 2022 published on March 9  2023 we reported on the progress of our sustainability performance.

NOTIFICATIONS UNDER CHAPTER 9  SECTION 5 OF THE SECURITIES MARKET ACT During the review period Suominen received no notifications under Chapter 9  Section 5 of the Securities Market Act. CHANGES IN THE EXECUTIVE TEAM Suominen announced on March 30  2023 that Tommi Björnman will start as the President & CEO on April 1  2023. Suominen announced on March 6  2023 that Janne Silonsaari was appointed as the CFO and a member of the Executive Team. He will start latest in June 2023.SHORT TERM RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES Regarding the war in Ukraine  the direct impact to Suominen’s business is minor as we have no customers nor suppliers in Russia  Belarus or Ukraine. Suominen as a company is mostly affected by the indirect economic impacts of the war.Suominen’s other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to: risks related to manufacturing  competition  raw material prices and availability  customer specific volumes and credits  changes in legislation  political environment or economic conditions and investments  and financial risks. A more detailed description of risks is available in Suominen’s Annual Report 2022 at suominen.fi/investors. BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT Suominen’s nonwovens are  for the most part  used in daily consumer goods  such as wipes as well as in hygiene and medical products. In these target markets of Suominen  the general economic situation determines the development of consumer demand  even though the demand for consumer goods is not very cyclical in nature. North America and Europe are the largest market areas for Suominen. In addition  the company operates in the South American markets. The growth in the demand for nonwovens has typically exceeded the growth of gross domestic product by a couple of percentage points. The near future continues to look challenging and the competition is fierce. The market remains unstable  and the same applies to raw material  energy and freight costs. However  we are more optimistic about the second half of the year. The raw material prices declined in Q1/2023 from the previous quarter (Q4/2022) and we are seeing signs that the raw material prices remain close to Q1/2023 level in the foreseeable future. It remains to be seen how the current economic climate impacts the end consumer demand and consumer preferences regarding wipes. Historically  the wipes market has been rather steady despite the general economic situation. OUTLOOK FOR 2023 Suominen expects that its comparable EBITDA (earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization) in 2023 will increase from 2022. In 2022  Suominen’s comparable EBITDA was EUR 15.3 million. EVENTS AFTER THE REPORTING PERIOD Suominen has completed the consultation procedure concerning its plan to permanently close manufacturing at its Mozzate plant in Italy (April 14  2023) Suominen announced on January 10  2023 that it will start consultation with local trade unions regarding a plan to permanently close manufacturing at its Mozzate plant. According to the plan  the production would end during the second quarter of 2023. Suominen has now completed the consultation procedure. Following the completion of the process  Suominen will move forward with its plan which will lead to closure of manufacturing and termination of employment of 54 employees in Mozzate. The terminations will incur an approximately EUR 2.3 million one-off expense that will be recognized in the second quarter of 2023.

Finance in Finland or alternative performance measures (cash flow from operations per share). Some of the other key ratios Suominen publishes are alternative performance measures. An alternative performance measure is a key ratio which has not been defined in IFRS standards. Suominen believes that the use of alternative performance measures provides useful information for example to investors regarding the Group's financial and operating performance and makes it easier to make comparisons between the reporting periods.

Brown  global head of applied research at Qontigo  a Deutsche Boerse-owned financial analytics and index provider.The U.S. economy added 253 000 jobs in April  far better than consensus expectations of 179 000  and well above March's downwardly revised figure of 165 000  the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday.""Strong job gains and low unemployment may signal that inflation is not over just yet "" Ms. Brown said by email. ""This is also on top of decent (first-quarter) earnings. That continued uncertainty could translate into more negative sentiment and higher volatility  especially as we won't hear from the Fed again for several weeks.""The next Federal Reserve meeting is June 13-14.The unemployment rate clocked in at 3.4% in April  slightly below the 3.5% rate in March. The jobless rate has ranged between 3.4% and 3.7% since March 2022  the BLS said in the report.Rhys Williams  chief strategist at Spouting Rock Asset Management  said that following release of the jobs report on Friday morning  the bond market is ""selling off as it was pricing in a rate cut as early as this summer.""Mr. Williams also said he doesn't think anything in the jobs data can be considered ""confirmatory that the economy is about to decline."" He further noted that downward revisions to the March report ""underscore that the jobs report should not be considered biblical truth  but more directional in nature  and one should look at several months together.""Spouting Rock has $2.3 billion in assets under management.The Federal Reserve will likely closely examine the April jobs report as it prepares to release its next monetary policy decision June 14.As of Friday morning  according to CME Group's FedWatch Tool  market participants' pricing of fed fund futures indicated there is an overwhelming 97.2% probability that the central bank will keep rates unchanged at the next meeting  and a scant 2.8% probability it will raise rates by another 25 basis points.The Fed's key short-term interest rate is now in a range of 5% to 5.25%  after the central bank raised rates by 25 basis points on Wednesday.",negative,0.12,0.23,0.65,mixed,0.26,0.19,0.55,True,English,"['April jobs report', ""investors' worries"", 'Strength', 'inflation', 'Deutsche Boerse-owned financial analytics', 'next monetary policy decision', 'key short-term interest rate', 'next Federal Reserve meeting', 'Spouting Rock Asset Management', 'strong April jobs report', 'Strong job gains', 'The Federal Reserve', 'institutional investor uncertainties', 'U.S. Bureau', 'decent (first-quarter) earnings', 'Melissa R.

After successfully launching the first estetrol-based product in 2021  the contraceptive pill Estelle®  Mithra continued to work towards innovation in manufacturing aimed at reducing cost of goods and potential environmental impact through the removal of a metal catalyst in the production process.The Mithra and CiTOS teams have developed a novel  intensified manufacturing methodology to improve robustness and productivity while ensuring a limited environmental footprint. The new metal-free process is based on the thermolysis of a key sulfoxide derivative of estrone. Early proof of concept for this novel methodology was published in the peer-reviewed industry journal Reaction Chemistry & Engineering earlier this year here .Mithra and CiTOS will continue their development work  with initial commercial production by a CDMO using the enhanced manufacturing process expected in 2026/27.David H Solomon  Chief Executive Officer of Mithra  commented: « Mithra’s collaboration with CiTOS demonstrates our commitment to innovation and sustainable drug supply in women’s health. With the mass production of estetrol integral to our daily activities  we are always looking at ways we can enhance the manufacturing process. This particular method allows us to produce estetrol at scale to meet increased demand while also delivering reduced cost of goods. »Story continuesJean-Christophe Monbaliu  Professor of Organic Chemistry at the University of Liège  added: « With this novel methodology we are able to yield about 1kg of the estetrol intermediate every three hours in just our pilot setup. If we applied these metrics to an industrial estetrol production setup  a forecast of several tons is achievable with minimal global footprint. »********For more information  please contact:Investor relations : investorrelations@mithra.comAbout MithraMithra (Euronext: MITRA) is a Belgian biotech company dedicated to transforming Women’s Health by offering new choices through innovation  with a particular focus on contraception and menopause.

This resulted in net inflows of €1.3 billion at Private Clients  and an increase in assets under management (AuM). In addition to this organic growth  we completed the acquisition of the remaining stake in Belgian wealth manager Mercier Vanderlinden in the quarter. We also took a major step with Evi van Lanschot with our intended acquisition of Robeco’s online investment platform (AuM: €4.7 billion). This acquisition is expected to complete this summer.Van Lanschot Kempen shares have been included in both the Euronext AMX Index and the AEX ESG Index since March 2023  underlining our growth both as an organisation and in terms of sustainability in the past few years. For us this is a great motivation to continue on our track and help our clients navigate through the key transitions of our time.”In the first quarter client assets increased to €128.3 billion (2022: €124.2 billion) and AuM to €112.8 billion (2022: €107.8 billion). Savings came down in the quarter to €11.6 billion (2022: €12.7 billion)  mostly as clients converted savings into investments. The loan portfolio remained stable at €9.4 billion and the addition to loan loss provisions was minor.Thanks in part to increased interest income  first-quarter results at Private Clients were strong  whereas less favourable conditions for mergers and acquisitions caused a decrease at Investment Banking Clients. The result from financial transactions also was lower than in the first quarter of 2022. Wholesale & Institutional Clients continues to focus on achieving profitable growth for investment strategies in Western Europe and for fiduciary management in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.Story continuesOur CET 1 ratio remains strong at 20.4% (2022: 20.6%) and Van Lanschot Kempen plans to return €2.00 per share to its shareholders in the second half of 2023 (about €85 million in total)  subject to regulatory approval.In April 2023 Van Lanschot Kempen completed its accelerated acquisition of the remaining 30% stake in Mercier Vanderlinden  for which it paid 53% in cash and 47% in shares  with a lock-up period until 2030. As a result  Mercier Vanderlinden’s managing partners obtained a 3.9% stake in Van Lanschot Kempen. Together with the Van Lanschot Belgium team they are currently preparing for the start of Mercier Van Lanschot to realise our growth ambitions within private banking in Belgium.At the end of March  four of the 10-strong small-cap team at Van Lanschot Kempen Investment Management announced their intention to leave. The quality of the team’s investment process is safeguarded by the Head of the Small-Cap Strategy and the team consisting of five small-cap managers  complemented by experienced sector specialists from Van Lanschot Kempen Investment Management’s other investment teams. Two new people have since been hired to help return the team back to full strength.Private Banking boosted its presence in the Groningen region with the addition of four new Private Banking colleagues  enabling Van Lanschot Kempen to respond even better to growth opportunities in this area.FINANCIAL CALENDAR25 May 2023 Annual General Meeting29 May 2023 Ex-dividend date6 June 2023 2022 dividend payment date24 August 2023 Publication of 2023 half-year results2 November 2023 Publication of 2023 third-quarter trading updateMedia Relations: + 31 20 354 45 85; mediarelations@vanlanschotkempen.comInvestor Relations: +31 20 354 45 90; investorrelations@vanlanschotkempen.comAbout Van Lanschot KempenVan Lanschot Kempen is an independent  specialist wealth manager active in private banking  investment management and investment banking  with the aim of preserving and creating wealth  in a sustainable way  for both its clients and the society of which it is part.

After fantastic first two quarters  also during the third quarter  we continued having very strong order intake and revenue generation  in particular for our Location Intelligence Services. Costs remain well under control  with a slight reduction compared with the previous year  despite the substantial growth in revenues and operational activities. In the first nine months  all business and financial key performance indicators remain positive  including EBITDA  EBIT and Cash Flow  confirming the trajectory indicated in the previous quarters.”The current financial year covers the 12 months period from 1 July 2022 to 30 June 2023. The first nine months cover the period from 1 July 2022 to 31 March 2023 and Q3 covers the 3 months period from January 2023 to March 2023.Story continuesIn the first nine months of FY 2022-23  GeoJunxion’s business continued with a strong performance: Revenue grew sharply (+60%) compared to the same period of the previous financial year. Order intake maintained a positive trajectory: the third quarter was in line with the results achieved in the same period of the previous year; while year to date  order intake is more than double compared with the same period of FY 2021/22. In Q3 FY 2022/23  operational expenses increased 10% compared with the same period in 2021/22  however this is justified given the 50% revenue growth in the quarter and 60% revenue growth for the first nine months. This resulted in a reduction of 2% for Net Operating Expenses  when compared with the first nine months of the previous financial year. The operating result  the result before tax  and the Net Profit are all positive. While the cash flow for the Q3 was slightly negative by €54K  the nine months still resulted in an overall positive cash flow of €444K. It’s also worth noting that the slightly negative cash flow for the quarter is due to timing; something that will be recovered during the course of the last quarter of the financial year.FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Q3 (January ‘23 - March ‘23) and the first 9 months of F.Y. 2022/23 (July ‘22 - March ‘23) vs same period in 2021/226 0 % revenue growth for the for the first 9 months of F.Y. 2022/23 (50% growth in Q3 2022-23) compared to the same period in 2021/22;2 % reduction in Net Operational Expenses ( OPEX ) for the 1H 2022/23 (10% increase in Q3 2022-’23);EBITDA and EB I T positive in the first 9 months of F.Y. 2022/23 by respectively €1.499K and €790K;Net Profit after tax of €4 03 K in the first 9 months of F.Y. 2022/23  compared to a Net Loss of €610K in the same period of FY 2021/22;Positive Cash Flow of €444K in the first 9 months of F.Y. 2022/23  compared to €79K in the same period of F.Y. 2021/22.Note: the positive sign in the variation % means improvement period over periodOUTLOOK FOR THE ACCOUNTING YEAR 2022-2023GeoJunxion is very pleased to increase  once again  the outlook for the accounting year 2022-’23: At the end of H1 FY 2022/23  we increased our topline growth to 30-35%. At this point in time  we expect an even more positive trajectory  with our topline to grow by 35-40% compared to last year. This expectation is built primarily on orders already booked and; to a much lesser extent  on a pipeline of opportunities from existing and new customers. With this improved topline  EBITDA  EBIT net income and Cash flow are expected to be positive.OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS AND STRATEGY UPDATEStrategy UpdateGeoJunxion’s strategy remains focused on creating “map agnostic” data products: digital geo-localized content  designed to be fully integrated into or overlaid on any commercial or open-source maps  or to be utilised in developing smart solutions for a large variety of use cases  in multiple industries and market sectors.Our strategy is solid as it has delivered year-over-year growth of +40% during the last 36 months. We will therefore continue to diligently execute on this strategy and expand the scope of our existing product portfolio and services.During the last quarter of the financial year  great attention and dedication will continue to be paid to the existing clients (Global Tech Companies) in executing custom Location Intelligence services and extending the scope of those projects.GeoJunxion’s activities are directed towards establishing long-term relationships with our customers  through the creation of recurring business models rather than opportunistic one-off contracts. Although the relationship with clients frequently starts with a proof-of-concept or a custom one-off project  most of the Company’s efforts go into building value-added  dynamic content  requiring continuous and frequent updates to maintain and increase their value over time. This means that most of our proof-of-concept and one-off projects are a launch-pad for establishing a service or license contract  converting the initial activities into a recurring  more predictable and sustainable business model.When executing projects  GeoJunxion typically retains the Intellectual Property and ownership of the newly developed datasets and solutions  for licensing to other customers. Thereby  leveraging the initial investment and creating a virtuous business cycle.Our mission remains focused on improving navigational safety and enhancing people mobility  contributing to a more sustainable world  reducing the impact on the environment  through intelligent solutions enabling more environmentally conscious decisions through informed choices.Central to GeoJunxion’s strategy are:Cost effective research  sourcing  production  ingestion  and aggregation of geodataFlexible licensing models at competitive pricingDirect delivery of dynamic  up-to-date content via APIsHighly flexible solutions and content creationMarket DevelopmentsWhile existing and prospective clients strictly monitor their expenditures and continue to be prudent in contracting projects  we are experiencing a growing interest in our Location Intelligence Services and last-mile mapping.In regard to some of the geopolitical challenges  GeoJunxion has no direct impact as a result of the war in Ukraine. Like others  we are susceptible to rising inflation  resulting from increased energy and other raw material prices. This does impact salaries  staff expenses  office costs and other indirect services. However  as already mentioned  such costs remain under control due to continuous and diligent monitoring.We also remark on the interest in and demand for location-aware content despite the concerns about the health of the global economy. While many big Companies in the last 6 to 12 months are making reductions in their respective workforces and cutting costs  GeoJunxion remains positive  having strengthened the team in recent years  with key hires necessary to drive growth and deliver strong results.The largest market opportunity for GeoJunxion remains by far with big Tech Companies  making extensive use of geo-localized data for their business and end-user solutions. In this market segment  we are dedicating a significant portion of our resources to project execution. We booked and executed sizable projects in all previous quarters  awarded project extensions and booked new opportunities also in the third quarter.In the automotive industry we confirm the previously announced interest derived from the adoption of advanced driver-assistance systems  such as ISA (Intelligent Speed Assistance). We confirm a growing demand for more cost-effective mapping solutions  with the most up-to-date and relevant content. This consideration is valid for the leisure market as well as for commercial heavy vehicle applications. Premium content pertaining to road safety and environmental sustainability remains our major interest and focus for product development.GeoJunxion also remains active in identifying opportunities in more traditional markets  such as Transport & Logistics  Real Estate  Geo-Marketing  Business Analysis  Travel & Tourism  as well as Public Administration. In the last quarter  Transport & Logistics and Business Analytics were the most active sectors.Business DevelopmentIn the third quarter of FY 2022-23  as well as for the entire fiscal year to date (9 months)  the Location Intelligence Services continued playing an essential role in our business development. The scope of certain projects awarded at the beginning of this financial year was extended and executed in the third quarter. Some of them are still on-going and will be complete in this Q4. As said  also in Q3 we have been awarded for new Location Intelligence projects. These contracts will continue to convert into revenue during this final quarter of the Financial Year 2022/23.During Q3  our Sales and Business development teams had the opportunity to attend more trade events in person. Meeting with partners and clients face to face  to promote GeoJunxion’s brand  its products and services. We also attended the Autonomy Mobility World Expo in Paris  in the Dutch Pavilion  as part of the Dutch delegation of Companies promoting their solutions to the mobility market. We give thanks to the Dutch Embassy in Paris and all the people that contributed to the organization of this important event.Business Development has been also very much focused on developing new solutions for the last-mile mapping market. In this regard  Altamura Francesco  GeoJunxion CBO & MD says: “last-mile mapping is an area that continues to interest our customers. We are extending our intentions from Outdoor only to Outdoor and Indoor custom maps  location positioning solutions  location analytics and  possibly  location marketing”.In order to reinforce our capability to deliver state-of-the-art last-mile mapping solutions  GeoJunxion established a partnership with WizzyMaps during the third quarter of the financial year. This collaboration delivered a solution for the Netherlands-Gibraltar football match qualifier and a last-mile interactive  navigable map for the Zuiderzee Museum.Zuiderzee Museum last-mile mapProduct DevelopmentCustom project executionWe continue to put significant efforts into the development of proprietary location intelligence content for a global Tech Company. The first project; announced in August ’22  has been extended in scope  and therefore continued into Q3. In the second quarter  additional projects for global Tech Companies have been added to our workload. Their execution has mostly been completed but there are some that are still in progress which are expected to be completed during the Q3 or Q4 of F.Y. 2022/23. In addition  there are other projects which are in the negotiation or in scope definition phase.Automotive product developmentOn the R&D side  a significant part of product development was focused on the execution and refinement of the data for a leading Infotainment System manufacturer. The first phase of this project; announced in April 2022 is now complete and we are currently working on defining the scope of the next phase  with the intent to industrialize the process and extend the development to new areas.Eco Alert Zones and School Safety ZonesSmart Geofences are key products in the GeoJunxion’s portfolio. Eco Alert Zones and School Safety Zones have been kept up to date during the course of the last quarter. They are increasing in number  geographical coverage and also in the type of areas.As announced during the last AGM we are working on an innovative proof of concept project with the intent to develop deep learning methods in the field of satellite imagery analysis and object recognition. This activity will continue for the entire year 2023  but it’s already delivering interesting preliminary results. This will give us the possibility to further enrich our existing datasets of geofences and create new ones.ORDER INTAKEOrder intake continued with a positive trend. The first two quarters have been exceptionally good  with Q1 being delivering the highest result compared to previous years. Q3 was also strong despite being slightly lower when compared to the same period last year. This resulted in the value of orders booked during the first nine months of the financial year 2022/23 to be more than double of those booked in the same period of the last accounting year.REVENUEIn Q3 2022/23  revenue increased by +50%. In Q2 the growth was of 45% in recurring revenue and 17% in non-recurring revenue. Q3 showed again growth in all product lines. Recurring revenue grew of 31% and non-recurring revenue 60% compared to the same period of last year. We are encouraged to see both product lines increasing in revenues  in particular the growth of the recurring product lines.In the first nine months of FY 2022/23  revenue increased by 60%. Also  during the same period  growth has been realized in all our product lines  with recurring revenue growing by almost 25% and non-recurring revenue growing by approximately 80%.GeoJunxion tracks its revenue by product and service type and by the nature of the underlying contract (recurring versus non-recurring). The main revenue growth has been realized in non-recurring location services  but also the recurring revenue from licenses and royalties showed an increase. The recurring service revenue grew as well as expected and announced at the end of the previous quarter. Recurring service revenue includes the updating services of our Eco Alert Zones product and other data products. The non-recurring service revenue includes tailored research and collection of data sets and creation of geo-located content.OPERATING RESULTThe Q3 2022-23 operating result shows a small loss of €7K  compared to a loss of €187K during the same quarter last year. This confirms the positive trend which already started in the prior quarters. There are two main drivers for this year-over-year improvement:50% increase in revenue to €750K (vs €500K  PY)a limited increase of 10% in the net operational expenses  despite strong inflationary pressures and the increase of 50% in revenue for the quarter.Higher Capitalized development costs +€23K (+17%) due to ongoing investments in new products and coverage extension of existing productsThe first nine months of FY 2022-23 operating result shows an operating profit €790K  compared to a loss of €372K during the same period of last year. The main drivers for such a positive result are similar to those mentioned for the quarterly improvement:60% increase in revenue to €2.962K (vs €1.854K  PY)2% decrease in net operational expenses. This is remarkable  considering inflationary pressures and the 60% increase in revenueHigher Capitalized development costs +€119K (+31%) due to ongoing investments in new products and coverage extension of existing products.ORGANIZATIONAs already remarked in the past quarter  GeoJunxion has achieved Level 2 certification on Social Entrepreneurship: the Prestatieladder Socialer Ondernemen. This independent assessment showed that GeoJunxion offers high-quality employment to people who have difficulty accessing the labor market and collaborating with like-minded organizations. With this certification  GeoJunxion provides an above-average contribution in the field of social entrepreneurship in a sustainable way.During the third quarter  GeoJunxion confirmed its attention to sensitive matters with social impact  supporting the Dutch Heart Foundation in its program to achieve the goal of “a healthy heart for everyone”. GeoJunxion cares about its employees  their health  working conditions and encourages all of them to adopt a healthy lifestyle.FINANCIAL POSITIONGeoJunxion has made great progress in turning its business around from a digital map supplier to a premium location content and location intelligence service provider with subscription based  recurring “data as a service” revenue models. The results reported for the first 9 months of FY 2022-23  with growing revenue and a net profit for the period  are evidence of this progress. Based on our current outlook  the available cash on hand is estimated to be sufficient to cover our operational requirements for at least the next 12 months.APPOINTMENT OF EXTERNAL AUDITORIn the past few months  we have had extensive discussions with OOB/PIE licensed auditing companies. In spite of improved financial results  positive cash flows  improved governance & internal control processes  none of the auditing companies contacted was willing to provide a quotation for performing the audit work. The main reasons given by the auditing firms are the lack of internal staff capacity to execute the work and the limited size of the company and its market capitalization.After the expiry of the 24-months period given by Euronext Amsterdam  on 13 April 2023  we received a letter from Euronext confirming ongoing non-compliance and their intention to proceed with the delisting process. We have formally objected to this decision from Euronext. In parallel we continue working to find alternative solutions  exploring various possible paths  with the intent to secure a solid future for the Company  in the best interest of all stakeholders involved.RISK MANAGEMENTRisk management is an integral managerial task. Our risk management and control procedures take into consideration the size of the company and the character of the business to identify the most significant risks which the company is exposed to. The risks identified are discussed on a periodical basis and mitigated or fully resolved  where possible. Such a system cannot provide absolute certainty that objectives will be realized. Neither can it guarantee prevention of potential cases of material mistakes  damage  fraud  or breaches of statutory laws.The 2021-22 Annual Report; as published on 27 October 2022  describes the primary strategic  operational  and financial risks. The risks and uncertainties described in the Annual Report are relevant and are deemed incorporated and repeated by reference in this report. There were no cases of material damage  fraud or breaches of law detected since issuing the Annual Accounts.Our people are our key assets  and we do our utmost to keep them engaged  safe and healthy.BOARD OF MANAGEMENT STATEMENTThe Board of Management hereby declares that  to the best of its knowledge  the summarized Q3 and first 9 months (July – March) 2022-’23 interim consolidated financial statements  drawn up in accordance with IAS 34 “Interim financial reporting”  represents a faithful rendering of the assets  liabilities  financial position  profit and cash flow of GeoJunxion NV and its subsidiary as stated in the consolidated financial statements  and that the Board Report  as included in this Interim Financial statements  represents a faithful rendering of the information required in relation to item 5:25d subs 8 and 9 of the Dutch Financial Supervision Act.GROUP STRUCTUREThe GeoJunxion group contains 2 entities: GeoJunxion N.V.

To be able to respond quickly and appropriately  we are placing the emphasis in our revised strategy on local approach and responsibility. Market position and returns are important to us. That is why we have recently started a reorganization  so that the local approach can be implemented effectively and efficiently. Knowledge  innovative power and focus on cost reduction are key drivers. After all  volumes are under pressure  as they were in the first quarter. This is mainly due to the impact of bird flu in the United Kingdom and Poland and the crisis in the pig sector. However  the good result in the ruminant sector in the first quarter in the United Kingdom was gratifying. To contribute to the transition of the sector  we must continue to innovate and therefore also to make returns. These are basic preconditions. My colleagues and I are convinced that we can make the adjustments in our approach and business operations and that we can include current and new customers in this transition.

(TSX-V.DMI)(OTCQB-DMIFF)(FRA:DC3A)  (""Diamcor"" or  the ""Company"") a Canadian based diamond mining Company with a proven history in the...","KELOWNA  BC / ACCESSWIRE / May 4  2023 / Diamcor Mining Inc. (TSX-V.DMI)(OTCQB-DMIFF)(FRA:DC3A)  (""Diamcor"" or  the ""Company"") a Canadian based diamond mining Company with a proven history in the mining  exploration  and sale of rough diamonds  announces today that it will be proceeding with an extensive drilling and bulk sampling program over the greater portions of its Krone-Endora at Venetia diamond mine project (the ""Project"").These efforts will be aimed at further identifying and locating additional material which is known to have shifted and eroded from the adjacent De Beers' Venetia diamond mine. Diamcor's establishment of infrastructure  two large processing plants  heavy equipment  and the extensive large-scale trial mining exercises completed to date in the initial area of 657 hectares of the Project's total 5 888 hectares  have allowed Diamcor to refine unique approaches to mining using advanced technology and techniques to extract diamonds from the Project in a safe  efficient  and environmentally responsible manner. The previous establishment of these collective items will allow Diamcor to now advance these additional drilling and bulk sampling efforts in a very cost-effective and efficient manner.""The considerable effort to date now allows us to proceed with this drilling and bulk sampling on the greater areas of the Project "" stated Mr. Dean Taylor  Diamcor's CEO. ""The knowledge gained from previous trial-mining and the sale of rough diamonds  along with recent modeling and initial input of some of the industry's most respected geological experts  all point to the potential to identify significant additional material from the known shift and erosion off of Venetia.""The initial trial-mining efforts undertaken to date have provided the Company with a better understanding of the shift and erosion of the estimated 1 000 vertical meters of material from the De Beers Venetia diamond mine kimberlite clusters that are known to have been displaced in the direction of Diamcor's Krone and Endora properties. Both properties are co-located with De Beers Venetia mine  which is recognized as one of the top-producing diamond mines in the world. Trial mining exercises are expected to continue on portions of the initial area in conjunction with the additional drilling and bulk sampling exercises  with both items serving to further advance the recommended work programmes from the Project's initial NI 43-101.Story continuesFurther details on the parties involved in the management and independent oversight of these drilling and bulk sampling exercises will be outlined in a separate release to be issued by the Company in the coming days.About Diamcor Mining Inc.Diamcor Mining Inc. is a fully reporting publicly traded Canadian diamond mining company with a well-established history in the mining  exploration  and sale of rough diamonds. The Company is listed on the TSX Venture Exchange (V.DMI)  and trades on the OTC QB International (DMIFF). The Company's primary focus is on the development of its Krone-Endora at Venetia Project which is co-located and directly adjacent to De Beers' Venetia Diamond Mine in South Africa. The Venetia diamond mine is recognized as one of the world's top diamond-producing mines  and the deposits which occur on Krone-Endora have been identified as being the result of shift and subsequent erosion of an estimated 1 000 vertical meters of material from the higher grounds of Venetia to the lower surrounding areas in the direction of Krone and Endora. The Company focuses on the acquisition and development of mid-tier projects with near-term production capabilities and growth potential and uses unique approaches to mining that involves the use of advanced technology and techniques to extract diamonds in a safe  efficient  and environmentally responsible manner. The Company has a strong commitment to social responsibility  including supporting local communities and protecting the environment.About the Tiffany & Co. AllianceThe Company has established a long-term strategic alliance and first right of refusal with Tiffany & Co. Canada  a subsidiary of world famous New York based Tiffany & Co.  to purchase up to 100% of the future production of rough diamonds from the Krone-Endora at Venetia Project at market prices. In conjunction with this first right of refusal  Tiffany & Co. Canada also provided the Company with financing in an effort to advance the Project as quickly as possible. Tiffany & Co. is now owned by Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (LVMH)  a publicly traded company which is listed on the Paris Stock Exchange (Euronext) under the symbol LVMH and on the OTC under the symbol LVMHF. For additional information on Tiffany & Co.  please visit their website at www.tiffany.com.About Krone-Endora at VenetiaIn February 2011  Diamcor acquired the Krone-Endora at Venetia Project from De Beers Consolidated Mines Limited  consisting of the prospecting rights over the farms Krone 104 and Endora 66  which represent a combined surface area of approximately 5 888 hectares directly adjacent to De Beers' flagship Venetia Diamond Mine in South Africa. On September 11  2014  the Company announced that the South African Department of Mineral Resources had granted a Mining Right for the Krone-Endora at Venetia Project encompassing 657.71 hectares of the Project's total area of 5 888 hectares. The Company has also submitted an application for a mining right over the remaining areas of the Project. The deposits which occur on the properties of Krone and Endora have been identified as a higher-grade ""Alluvial"" basal deposit which is covered by a lower-grade upper ""Eluvial"" deposit. The deposits are proposed to be the result of the direct-shift (in respect to the ""Eluvial"" deposit) and erosion (in respect to the ""Alluvial"" deposit) of material from the higher grounds of the adjacent Venetia Kimberlite areas. The deposits on Krone-Endora occur with a maximum total depth of approximately 15.0 metres from surface to bedrock  allowing for a very low-cost mining operation to be employed with the potential for near-term diamond production from a known high-quality source. Krone-Endora also benefits from the significant development of infrastructure and services already in place due to its location directly adjacent to the Venetia Mine  which is widely recognised as one of the top producing diamond mines in the world.Qualified Person Statement:Mr. James P.

Details from the presentation will be available following the event on the Cellectis website at: https://www.cellectis.com/en/investors/scientific-presentations/Licensed Allogeneic CAR T-cell Development ProgramsServier and Allogene: anti-CD19 programsAllogene continues to enroll patients in the industry’s first potentially pivotal Phase 2 allogeneic CAR T clinical trial with ALLO-501A. Allogene announced that the single-arm ALPHA2 trial will enroll approximately 100 r/r large B cell lymphoma (LBCL) patients who have received at least two prior lines of therapy and have not received prior anti-CD19 therapy. Allogene expects to complete enrollment in H1 2024.After the close of the quarter  Allogene announced that pooled data from the Phase 1 ALPHA/ALPHA2 trials of ALLO-501/501A  in r/r LBCL would be presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting June 2 – 6  2023 in Chicago  Illinois.Allogene: anti-BCMA and anti-CD70 programsAllogene presented interim data from its Phase 1 TRAVERSE trial of ALLO-316  its first investigational product candidate for solid tumors  during an oral presentation at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting in April. The ongoing dose escalation study is enrolling patients with advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) who have progressed on standard therapies that included an immune checkpoint inhibitor and a VEGF-targeting therapy. The data reported to date is primarily from the DL1 and DL2 cohorts.Anti-tumor activity was primarily observed in patients with tumors confirmed to express CD70 (N=10). Among 18 patients evaluable for efficacy  the disease control rate (DCR) was 89%. In the 10 patients whose tumors were known to express CD70  the disease control rate was 100%  which included three patients who achieved partial remission (two confirmed  one unconfirmed). The longest response lasted until month eight. There was a trend toward greater tumor shrinkage in patients with higher levels of CD70 expression. In patients evaluable for safety (N=19)  ALLO-316 demonstrated an adverse event profile generally consistent with autologous CAR T therapies.Dose escalation in the TRAVERSE trial is expected to be completed in 2023.During the quarter  data from the Phase 1 UNIVERSAL trial with ALLO-715 for the treatment of r/r multiple myeloma (MM) was published in Nature Medicine. UNIVERSAL is the first allogeneic anti-BCMA CAR T to demonstrate proof-of-concept in MM with response rates that are similar to an approved autologous CAR T therapy. Allogene is evaluating manufacturing processes improvements across its BCMA candidates to achieve optimal performance.PartnershipsCytovia Therapeutics  Inc.

Consequently  after the completion of the Transaction  and subject to the issuance of some or all of such RSUs  Cellectis will own approximately 2.4% of Calyxt.Cellectis currently holds a 48.2 % equity interest in Calyxt. Following the closing of the merger  Cellectis is expected to own approximately 2.4% of the equity interests of the combined company.Warrant agreement with the European Investment BankOn April 4  Cellectis announced it entered into the warrant agreement (the “Warrant Agreement”) and finalized the related ancillary documents required under the credit facility with the European Investment Bank (“EIB”) for up to €40 million previously announced on December 28  2022. The Company also announced the drawdown of the first tranche of €20 million (“Tranche A”) under the Finance Contract  that has been disbursed by the EIB in early April 2023.Cellectis plans to use the proceeds of Tranche A towards the development of its pipeline of allogeneic CAR T-cell product candidates: UCART22  UCART20x22  UCART123.Financial resultsThe interim condensed consolidated financial statements of Cellectis  which consolidate the results of Calyxt  Inc. of which Cellectis owned approximately 48.2% of outstanding shares of common stock (as of March 31  2023)  have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards  as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IFRS”).We present certain financial metrics broken out between our two reportable segments – Therapeutics and Plants – in the appendices of this Q1 2023 financial results press release.On January 13  2023  Calyxt  Cibus Global LLC (Cibus) and certain other parties named therein  entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”)  pursuant to which  subject to the terms and conditions thereof  Calyxt and Cibus will merge in an all-stock transaction (the “Calyxt Merger”). As a consequence of the foregoing  Calyxt meets the “held-for-sale"" criteria specified in IFRS 5 and has been classified as a discontinued operation.Cash: As of March 31  2023  Cellectis  excluding Calyxt  had $88 million in consolidated cash  cash equivalents  and restricted cash. This compares to $95 million in consolidated cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash as of December 31  2022. This difference mainly reflects $30 million of cash out  which include $6 million of payments for R&D expenses  $4 million for SG&A suppliers  $15 million for staff costs  $4 million for rents and taxes  $1 million of reimbursement of the “PGE” loan and a $23 million net cash inflow from the capital raise closed in February.Based on the current operating plan  Cellectis (excluding Calyxt) anticipates that the cash and cash equivalents as of March 31  2023 will fund Cellectis’ operations into the third quarter of 2024.Revenues and Other Income: Consolidated revenues and other income were $3.6 million for the three months ended March 31  2023 compared to $3.8 million for the three months ended March 31  2022. The slight decrease of $0.2 million between the three months ended March 31  2023  and 2022 reflects the recognition of two milestones related to Cellectis’ agreement with Cytovia for $1.5 million in 2022 while recognition of revenues in 2023 is not material and was almost fully offset by an increase of the research tax credit for $1.0 million in addition to the recognition of a BPI R&D grant of $0.3 million.R&D Expenses: Consolidated R&D expenses were $21.1 million three months ended March 31  2023 compared to $26.6 million for the three months ended March 31  2022. The $5.5 million decrease was primarily attributable to (i) a $2.6 million decrease in personal expenses due to departures not replaced (ii) a $3.0 million decrease in purchases  external expenses and other (from $13.8 million in 2022 to $10.8 million in 2023) mainly explained by internalization of our manufacturing and quality activities to support our R&D pipeline.SG&A Expenses: Consolidated SG&A expenses were $5.0 million for the three months ended March 31  2023 compared to $6.1 million for the three months ended March 31  2022. The $1.1 million decrease primarily reflects (i) a $0.9 million decrease in purchases  external expenses and other (from $3.7 million in 2022 to $2.9 million in 2023) mainly explained by the implementation of our new enterprise resource planning (ERP) software in 2022 (ii) a $0.2 million decrease in personal expenses.Net income (loss) from discontinued operations: The $1.7 million decrease of net loss from discontinued operations between the three-month period ended March 31  2022 and 2023 is primarily driven by (i) the decrease of $2.6 million of R&D expenses (from $3.2 million in 2022 to $1.3 in 2023) and SG&A expenses (from $2.9 million in 2022 to $2.2 million in 2023) partially offset by (i) the increase of $0.7 million of net financial loss and (ii) the increase of $0.2 million of other operating expenses.Net Income (loss) Attributable to Shareholders of Cellectis including Calyxt: The consolidated net loss attributable to shareholders of Cellectis was $30.1 million (or $0.58 per share) for the three months ended March 31  2023  of which $27.8 million was attributed to Cellectis continuing operations  compared to $31.9 million (or $0.70 per share) for the three months ended March 31  2022  of which $28.3 million was attributed to Cellectis continuing operations. This $1.8 million decrease in net loss between the three months of 2023 and 2022 was primarily driven by (i) a $5.3 million decrease of research and development  (ii) a decrease of $1.7 million of loss from discontinued operations  (iii) a $1.3 million decrease of SG&A expenses partially offset by (i) an increase in net financial loss of $5.3 million primarily due to the decrease of the fair value of Cytovia’s convertible note on March 31  2023 of $4.6 million compared to a $7.9 million on December 31  2022  (ii) a decrease of $0.2 million of revenues and other income  (iii) an increase of other operating expenses of $0.6 million  (iv) a decrease of $0.4 million in loss attributable to non-controlling interests due to the decrease in Calyxt’s net loss.Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Shareholders of Cellectis: The consolidated adjusted net loss attributable to shareholders of Cellectis was $28.1 million (or $0.55 per share) for the three months ended March 31  2023  of which $26.2 million is attributed to Cellectis  compared to a net loss of $29.3 million (or $0.64 per share) for the three months ended March 31  2022  of which $26.0 million was attributed to Cellectis.Please see “Note Regarding Use of Non-IFRS Financial Measures” for reconciliation of GAAP net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis to adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis.We currently foresee focusing our cash spending at Cellectis for 2023 in the following areas:Supporting the development of our pipeline of product candidates  including the manufacturing and clinical trial expenses of UCART123  UCART22  UCART 20x22 and potential new product candidates  andOperating our state-of-the-art manufacturing capabilities in Paris (France)  and Raleigh (North Carolina  USA); andContinuing strengthening our manufacturing and clinical departments.CELLECTIS S.A.

Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis is not a measure calculated in accordance with IFRS. We have included in this press release a reconciliation of this figure to net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis  which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with IFRS. Because adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis excludes Non-cash stock-based compensation expense—a non-cash expense  we believe that this financial measure  when considered together with our IFRS financial statements  can enhance an overall understanding of Cellectis’ financial performance. Moreover  our management views the Company’s operations  and manages its business  based  in part  on this financial measure. In particular  we believe that the elimination of Non-cash stock-based expenses from Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core businesses. Our use of adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis has limitations as an analytical tool  and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under IFRS. Some of these limitations are: (a) other companies  including companies in our industry which use similar stock-based compensation  may address the impact of Non-cash stock- based compensation expense differently; and (b) other companies may report adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders or similarly titled measures but calculate them differently  which reduces their usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these and other limitations  you should consider adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis alongside our IFRS financial results  including Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis.RECONCILIATION OF IFRS TO NON-IFRS NET INCOME – First Quarter (unaudited) ($ in thousands  except per share data) For the three-month period ended March 31  2022 * 2023 Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis (31 911 ) (30 074 ) Adjustment: Non-cash stock-based compensation expense attributable to shareholders of Cellectis 2 648 1 979 Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis (29 263 ) (28 095 ) Basic Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($/share) (0.64 ) (0.55 ) Basic adjusted earnings from discontinued operations attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($ /share) (0.07 ) (0.04 ) Weighted average number of outstanding shares  basic (units) 45 486 477 51 452 348 Diluted Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($/share) (0.64 ) (0.55 ) Diluted Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($/share) from discontinued operations (0.07 ) (0.04 ) Weighted average number of outstanding shares  diluted (units) 45 486 477 51 452 348*These amounts reflect adjustments made in connection with the presentation of the discontinued operationAbout CellectisCellectis is a clinical-stage biotechnology company using its pioneering gene-editing platform to develop life-saving cell and gene therapies.

As such  you should not place undue reliance on this information. This information may not be indicative of the actual results for any future period.The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the sanctions imposed by the United States  member states of the European Union  the European Union itself  the United Kingdom  Ukraine and certain other nations  counter-sanctions by Russia and other legal and regulatory responses  as well as responses by our service providers  partners  suppliers and other counterparties  and the consequences of all of the foregoing have impacted and  if the conflict  sanctions and such responses continue or escalate  may significantly impact our results and aspects of our operations in Russia and Ukraine  and may significantly affect our results and aspects of our operations in the other countries in which we operate. We are closely monitoring events in Russia and Ukraine  as well as the possibility of the imposition of further sanctions in connection with the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and any resulting further rise in tensions between Russia and the United States  the United Kingdom and/or the European Union. Although our Russian operations are now classified as ‘held for sale’ and ‘discontinued operations’ and do not contribute to our comparison base or actual reported numbers in this release (except as specifically stated)  our operations in Ukraine continue to be affected by the conflict. We hope that there will be a peaceful and amicable resolution and are doing everything we can to protect the safety of our employees  while continuing to ensure the uninterrupted operation of our communications  financial and digital services.The comprehensive sanctions on investment and vendors in Russia and the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine have had a significant impact on the Company’s operations and business plans in Russia and Ukraine and may continue to have a significant impact on the Company’s operations and business plans in Ukraine. During the three months ended 31 March 2023  we have not recorded any impairment charges related to the Russian operations and have not recorded significant impairment charges related to the Ukrainian operations. However  we may need to record future impairment charges  which could be significant if the conflict continues or escalates and as more information becomes available to management. It is possible further impairment charges may rise to such a level on an accounting basis as to require additional analysis of true asset values in order to determine the true value of assets to be compared to liabilities as outlined in the provisions of our debt agreements.Due to the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the consequences as mentioned above  the Company requires additional time to complete all necessary disclosures in its Annual Report on Form 20-F to be filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“U.S. SEC”) as well as its Dutch financial statements to be filed with the Autoriteit Financiële Markten (“AFM”)  including completing its preparation of VEON’s consolidated financial statements and subsequently receiving the related audit report on the financial statements and internal control over financial reporting from its independent registered public accounting firm.

In this announcement “Shell”  “Shell Group” and “Group” are sometimes used for convenience where references are made to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general. Likewise  the words “we”  “us” and our” are also used to refer to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general or to those who work for them. These terms are also used where no useful purpose is served by identifying the particular entity or entities. ‘‘Subsidiaries’’  “Shell subsidiaries” and “Shell companies” as used in this announcement refer to entities over which Shell plc either directly or indirectly has control. Entities and unincorporated arrangements over which Shell has joint control are generally referred to as “joint ventures” and “joint operations”  respectively. “Joint ventures” and “joint operations” are collectively referred to as “joint arrangements”. Entities over which Shell has significant influence but neither control nor joint control are referred to as “associates”. The term “Shell interest” is used for convenience to indicate the direct and/or indirect ownership interest held by Shell in an entity or unincorporated joint arrangement  after exclusion of all third-party interest.Forward-Looking StatementsThis announcement contains forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) concerning the financial condition  results of operations and businesses of Shell. All statements other than statements of historical fact are  or may be deemed to be  forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management’s current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking statements include  among other things  statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management’s expectations  beliefs  estimates  forecasts  projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as “aim”  “ambition”  ‘anticipate’’  ‘‘believe’’  ‘‘could’’  ‘‘estimate’’  ‘‘expect’’  ‘‘goals’’  ‘‘intend’’  ‘‘may’’  “milestones”  ‘‘objectives’’  ‘‘outlook’’  ‘‘plan’’  ‘‘probably’’  ‘‘project’’  ‘‘risks’’  “schedule”  ‘‘seek’’  ‘‘should’’  ‘‘target’’  ‘‘will’’ and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this announcement  including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell’s products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets  and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative  judicial  fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks  including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities  delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics  such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak; and (n) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this announcement are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc’s Form 20-F for the year ended December 31  2022 (available at www.shell.com/investor and www.sec.gov ). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this announcement and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement  May 4  2023. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information  future events or other information. In light of these risks  results could differ materially from those stated  implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this announcement.Shell’s net carbon intensityAlso  in this announcement we may refer to Shell’s “Net Carbon Intensity”  which includes Shell’s carbon emissions from the production of our energy products  our suppliers’ carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers’ carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the term Shell’s “Net Carbon Intensity” is for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.Shell’s net-Zero Emissions TargetShell’s operating plan  outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly  they reflect our Scope 1  Scope 2 and Net Carbon Intensity (NCI) targets over the next ten years. However  Shell’s operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target and 2035 NCI target  as these targets are currently outside our planning period. In the future  as society moves towards net-zero emissions  we expect Shell’s operating plans to reflect this movement. However  if society is not net zero in 2050  as of today  there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.Forward Looking Non-GAAP measuresThis announcement may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as cash capital expenditure and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell  such as oil and gas prices  interest rates and exchange rates.

In the meantime  Christophe Bonduelle  Chairman of the Board of Directors  will assume the role of Chief Executive Officer  with the support of Guillaume Debrosse during this transition period.In addition  Pierre and Benoît Bonduelle SAS company  General Manager of Bonduelle SCA  will henceforth be represented by its legal representative  Christophe Bonduelle.2022-2023 OutlooksIn an environment of continuing inflation and social tensions in certain countries  food consumption underwent a significant downturn in Quarter 3  which was reflected in the group's sales performance.In this highly volatile environment  and taking into account the performance of the first 9 months of the year  the Bonduelle Group is targeting for the financial year  a revenue growth of around 5% fueled by mandatory price increases in a still inflationist environment and confirms its objective of a stable current operating margin compared with the previous financial year  both at constant exchange rates and scope of consolidation.* At constant currency exchange rate and scope of consolidation basis. The revenues in foreign currency over the given period are translated into the rate of exchange for the comparable period. The impact of business acquisitions (or gain of control) and divestments is restated as followsFor businesses acquired (or gain of control) during the current period  revenue generated since the acquisition date is excluded from the organic growth calculation;For businesses acquired (or gain of control) during the prior fiscal year  revenue generated during the current period up until the first anniversary date of the acquisition is excluded;For businesses divested (or loss of control) during the prior fiscal year  revenue generated in the comparative period of the prior fiscal year until the divestment date is excluded. In the specific case of the loss of control of the long life activities in North America  the IFRS 5 standard having been applied to the historical data  the revenue is already restated in the historical elements;For businesses divested (or loss of control) during the current fiscal year  revenue generated in the period commencing 12 months before the divestment date up to the end of the comparative period of the prior fiscal year is excluded.Alternative performance indicators : the group presents in its financial notices performance indicators not defined by accounting standards.

Printhead Solutions revenues significantly recovered year-over-year as the chip shortages which heavily impacted Q1 2022 revenues have abated.“Group EBITDA was up in Q1 mainly due to increased revenue. In the Printhead Solutions segment  higher input costs resulting from sourcing difficulties and higher component prices in 2022 did weigh on overall margin contribution  which will continue for some time throughout 2023.

Net debt at €1 072 millionIntegration of Arcadis IBI and Arcadis DPS on track  revenue and cost synergies materializingAmsterdam  4 May 2023 – Arcadis (EURONEXT: ARCAD)  the leading global Design & Consultancy organization for natural and built assets  sees continued growing client demand across all of its Global Business Areas  resulting in record Q1 Net Revenue of €940m with an organic growth of 12.3%. Operating EBITA margin increased to 9.8% (last year: 9.4%).Peter Oosterveer  CEO Arcadis  comments:“During the last quarter  we have continued to see strong client demand for our services. Our Resilience business demonstrated strong results across the solutions portfolio. Our Places business has reaped the benefits of our diversification towards industrial manufacturing  intelligent buildings  and retrofitting  resulting in a more balanced backlog and solid pipeline. Our Mobility business increasingly supports clients with electrification and decarbonization of infrastructure assets. And strong demand for smart mobility solutions drives growth in our recently established Intelligence business.We are pleased to report that the integration of both Arcadis IBI and Arcadis DPS is progressing well. Our combined capabilities created significant wins in industrial manufacturing  pharmaceutical  semiconductor  and energy transition  and we are building a strong pipeline of additional synergy opportunities  whilst the expected cost synergies are materializing simultaneously.Our strong client relationships  diverse business offering and continued solid markets provide us with the opportunity to be more selective in the projects we pursue on  creating a resilient and balanced portfolio with sustained focus on profitable growth. The strong demand for our services originates from governments  public agencies as well as the private sector  despite the ongoing geopolitical turbulence and economic uncertainties.Story continuesIt has been both an honor and a privilege to lead Arcadis over the past six years. We significantly strengthened our focus on people  prioritized client relationships  while improving discipline around project selection and delivery. Sustainability has always been a cornerstone of the organization and we built on this foundation with a Sustainability Strategy and a Net Zero commitment  while addressing the growing client demand for sustainability solutions. We have transformed our operating model  complemented our capabilities through the acquisitions of last year  whilst divesting non-core areas. Capitalizing on its talented diverse teams  Arcadis  under the leadership of my nominated successor Alan Brookes  is well positioned to retain and attract talent  bring groundbreaking solutions and services to our clients  deliver profitable growth  and deliver on its strategic objectives.”KEY FIGURESAs the acquisitions of the IBI Group formally closed on 27th of September 2022  and DPS Group on 1st of December 2022  the Arcadis consolidated financial statements 2023 include IBI and DPS consolidated data.in € millions First quarter Period ended 31 March 2023 2023 2022 change Gross revenues 1 218 879 39% Net revenues 940 688 37% Organic growth1) 12.3% 5.6% Operating EBITDA2) 120 86 40% Operating EBITDA margin 12.8% 12.5% EBITA 87 65 33% EBITA margin 9.2% 9.5% Operating EBITA2) 92 64 43% Operating EBITA margin (%) 9.8% 9.4% Free Cash Flow (excl. lease liabilities)3) -108 -51 114% Net Working Capital % 12.9% 12.9% Days Sales Outstanding (days) 70 70 Net Debt 1 072 205 422% Order intake (millions) 1 062 785 35% Net revenues in backlog (millions) 3 192 2 349 36% Backlog organic growth (qtd)1) 3.9% 4.4%1) This excludes the impact of currency movements  acquisitions  divestments  and footprint reductions (such as the Middle East)2) Excluding acquisition  restructuring and non-operating integration-related costs3) Free Cash flow: Cash Flow from Operations corrected for Capex and Lease liabilitiesINCOME STATEMENTNet revenues totaled €940 million and increased organically by 12.3%. Growth was driven by all the GBAs  with exceptionally strong performance in North America. The currency impact was 0.5%. The operating EBITA margin improved to 9.8% (Q1’22: 9.4%).ORDER INTAKE & BACKLOGBacklog at the end of the quarter stood at €3 192 million (Q1’22: €2 349 million)  with strong business momentum leading to an order intake of €1 062 million (up 35% year on year) for the quarter. Organic backlog growth was 3.9% quarter-to-date  with a positive contribution of all GBAs and with very few project cancellations.BALANCE SHEET & CASH FLOWDays Sales Outstanding (DSO) stood at 70 days (Q1'22: 70 days) and net working capital as a percentage of annualized gross revenues at 12.9% (Q1'22: 12.9%)  in line with last year’s performance.The negative free cash flow generation during the quarter of €108 million reflects a year-on-year increase in line with our usual seasonal networking capital pattern applied to a significantly larger business volume and investments in net working capital from the very strong revenue growth.Net debt increased slightly to €1 072 million  with deleveraging on track. The bridge loan of €750 million was partly refinanced by a successful €500 million inaugural Eurobond issuance. The senior unsecured fixed rate notes have an annual coupon of 4.875%  are due 2028  and an investment grade rating of BBB- from Standard & Poor’s.INTEGRATION OF ARCADIS IBI AND ARCADIS DPSThe integration of Arcadis IBI and Arcadis DPS is on track with revenue and cost synergies materializing. The Architecture and Urbanism business unit is up and running as part of the Places GBA and sees strong momentum as it launches its first commercial events. The Intelligence GBA management team is set up and works closely with the Integration team to set a fit-for-purpose organization  consolidating the various organizations  and fostering innovation. Finally  Arcadis DPS is progressively embedded in the Places GBA  creating additional strengths in the industrial manufacturing area. Various revenue synergy opportunities were converted into order intake during the quarter  and we are progressing as planned on extracting the expected cost synergies.PERFORMANCE BY GLOBAL BUSINESS AREASRESILIENCE(35% of net revenues) in € millions First quarter Period ended 31 March 2023 2023 2022 change Net revenues 332 281 18% Organic growth1) 13.0% 6.9% Order intake (millions) 423 338 25% Net revenues in backlog (millions) 980 850 15% Backlog organic growth (qtd)1) 10.0% 7.2%1) This excludes the impact of currency movements  acquisitions  divestments  and footprint reductions (such as the Middle East)Solid revenue and backlog growth in the quarter was driven by all regions. We continue to see strong client demand in environmental restoration  with our leading position in PFAS. Clients increasingly look for our support in adopting renewable energy  in order to meet their Net-Zero ambitions. Clients’ demand continues to be strong for our enviro-social permitting solutions to deal with the issues in delivering their capital programs due to higher energy costs and sticky processes. Collaboration with Arcadis IBI results in cross selling to their client base. Strong market demands force us to set the right priorities.PLACES(41% of net revenues) in € millions First quarter Period ended 31 March 2023 2023 2022 change Net revenues 388 228 70% Organic growth1) 8.7% 1.1% Order intake (millions) 407 259 57% Net revenues in backlog (millions) 1 555 976 59% Backlog organic growth (qtd)1) 1.3% 3.3%1) This excludes the impact of currency movements  acquisitions  divestments  and footprint reductions (such as the Middle East)Revenue growth in the quarter was driven by a strong performance in North America and Europe  being key markets after the strategic repositioning last year. Good backlog growth in North America and Europe was partly offset by China and softer market conditions in the UK. We are successfully pressing ahead with the integration of Arcadis IBI and Arcadis DPS and have identified substantial synergy opportunities in the pipeline  while already securing a number of wins. Demand for sustainable and intelligent buildings and industrial manufacturing facilities continues with vast addressable markets and clients following federal and private funding.MOBILITY(21% of net revenues) in € millions First quarter Period ended 31 March 2023 2023 2022 change Net revenues 200 179 12% Organic growth1) 15.3% 9.4% Order intake (millions) 211 187 13% Net revenues in backlog (millions) 545 524 4% Backlog organic growth (qtd)1) 1.8% 1.7%1) This excludes the impact of currency movements  acquisitions  divestments  and footprint reductions (such as the Middle East)Continued very strong revenue growth for Mobility in the quarter  driven by US  Australia  and the UK. Growing demand for digital solutions focused on solving mobility challenges. The demand for electrification and decarbonization solutions continues to dominate requirements from clients. High revenue visibility for the remainder of the year. Order intake is typically lumpy  as projects are more sizeable compared to the remainder of the portfolio.

This resulted in net inflows of €1.3 billion at Private Clients  and an increase in assets under management (AuM). In addition to this organic growth  we completed the acquisition of the remaining stake in Belgian wealth manager Mercier Vanderlinden in the quarter. We also took a major step with Evi van Lanschot with our intended acquisition of Robeco’s online investment platform (AuM: €4.7 billion). This acquisition is expected to complete this summer.Van Lanschot Kempen shares have been included in both the Euronext AMX Index and the AEX ESG Index since March 2023  underlining our growth both as an organisation and in terms of sustainability in the past few years. For us this is a great motivation to continue on our track and help our clients navigate through the key transitions of our time.”In the first quarter client assets increased to €128.3 billion (2022: €124.2 billion) and AuM to €112.8 billion (2022: €107.8 billion). Savings came down in the quarter to €11.6 billion (2022: €12.7 billion)  mostly as clients converted savings into investments. The loan portfolio remained stable at €9.4 billion and the addition to loan loss provisions was minor.Thanks in part to increased interest income  first-quarter results at Private Clients were strong  whereas less favourable conditions for mergers and acquisitions caused a decrease at Investment Banking Clients. The result from financial transactions also was lower than in the first quarter of 2022. Wholesale & Institutional Clients continues to focus on achieving profitable growth for investment strategies in Western Europe and for fiduciary management in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.Our CET 1 ratio remains strong at 20.4% (2022: 20.6%) and Van Lanschot Kempen plans to return €2.00 per share to its shareholders in the second half of 2023 (about €85 million in total)  subject to regulatory approval.In April 2023 Van Lanschot Kempen completed its accelerated acquisition of the remaining 30% stake in Mercier Vanderlinden  for which it paid 53% in cash and 47% in shares  with a lock-up period until 2030. As a result  Mercier Vanderlinden’s managing partners obtained a 3.9% stake in Van Lanschot Kempen. Together with the Van Lanschot Belgium team they are currently preparing for the start of Mercier Van Lanschot to realise our growth ambitions within private banking in Belgium.At the end of March  four of the 10-strong small-cap team at Van Lanschot Kempen Investment Management announced their intention to leave. The quality of the team’s investment process is safeguarded by the Head of the Small-Cap Strategy and the team consisting of five small-cap managers  complemented by experienced sector specialists from Van Lanschot Kempen Investment Management’s other investment teams. Two new people have since been hired to help return the team back to full strength.Private Banking boosted its presence in the Groningen region with the addition of four new Private Banking colleagues  enabling Van Lanschot Kempen to respond even better to growth opportunities in this area.FINANCIAL CALENDAR25 May 2023 Annual General Meeting29 May 2023 Ex-dividend date6 June 2023 2022 dividend payment date24 August 2023 Publication of 2023 half-year results2 November 2023 Publication of 2023 third-quarter trading updateMedia Relations: + 31 20 354 45 85; mediarelations@vanlanschotkempen.comInvestor Relations: +31 20 354 45 90; investorrelations@vanlanschotkempen.comAbout Van Lanschot KempenVan Lanschot Kempen is an independent  specialist wealth manager active in private banking  investment management and investment banking  with the aim of preserving and creating wealth  in a sustainable way  for both its clients and the society of which it is part.

After successfully launching the first estetrol-based product in 2021  the contraceptive pill Estelle®  Mithra continued to work towards innovation in manufacturing aimed at reducing cost of goods and potential environmental impact through the removal of a metal catalyst in the production process.The Mithra and CiTOS teams have developed a novel  intensified manufacturing methodology to improve robustness and productivity while ensuring a limited environmental footprint. The new metal-free process is based on the thermolysis of a key sulfoxide derivative of estrone. Early proof of concept for this novel methodology was published in the peer-reviewed industry journal Reaction Chemistry & Engineering earlier this year here .Mithra and CiTOS will continue their development work  with initial commercial production by a CDMO using the enhanced manufacturing process expected in 2026/27.David H Solomon  Chief Executive Officer of Mithra  commented: « Mithra’s collaboration with CiTOS demonstrates our commitment to innovation and sustainable drug supply in women’s health. With the mass production of estetrol integral to our daily activities  we are always looking at ways we can enhance the manufacturing process. This particular method allows us to produce estetrol at scale to meet increased demand while also delivering reduced cost of goods. »Jean-Christophe Monbaliu  Professor of Organic Chemistry at the University of Liège  added: « With this novel methodology we are able to yield about 1kg of the estetrol intermediate every three hours in just our pilot setup. If we applied these metrics to an industrial estetrol production setup  a forecast of several tons is achievable with minimal global footprint. »********For more information  please contact:Investor relations : investorrelations@mithra.comAbout MithraMithra (Euronext: MITRA) is a Belgian biotech company dedicated to transforming Women’s Health by offering new choices through innovation  with a particular focus on contraception and menopause.

Volume and mix was overall stable  with growth in baby pants and adult care in Europe  offsetting customer destocking in North America. Including favorable forex  total revenue was up 16% year on year.Adjusted EBITDA [1] of Core Markets was €41 million  up 95% year on year. While pricing offset the additional input cost inflation in the quarter versus a year ago  it does not cover the total cumulative cost inflation incurred since 2021. Operating cost reduction measures continued to reduce the operational cost base by close to 5% year on year. The adjusted EBITDA margin rose to 9.1%  up 3.7pp year on year and 0.4pp quarter on quarter.Total Group revenue was €652 million  up 16% like for like versus Q1 2022  including an equally strong  price-driven contribution from the discontinued Emerging Markets. Adjusted EBITDA came in at €56 million  up 126% year on year  and 9% quarter on quarter pursuing the recovery shown since Q3 2022. The adjusted EBITDA margin of 8.5% was up 4.1pp versus Q1 and 1.0pp versus Q4 2022.Net debt for the total Group was largely stable ending at €880 million on March 31  before the proceeds from the Mexican divestment were received. Combined with a significantly improved last-twelve-months adjusted EBITDA the leverage ratio reduced further to 5.3x  from 6.4x at the start of the year.2023 OutlookIn the context of the continuing volatile inflationary macro-economic environment  Ontex confirms its 2023 outlook  expecting:Story continuesRevenue of Core Markets  to grow by high single-digit  consolidating the improvement realized in 2022 and further balancing the portfolio;Adjusted EBITDA margin for Core Markets in a range of 8% to 10%   with cost inflation headwinds to be offset as additional pricing is passed through and structural cost reduction measures continue to deliver ;Discontinued operations to contribute positively to adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow;Leverage to reduce by year end to less than 4x  with improving profitability and cash flow discipline remaining a focus.CEO quoteGustavo Calvo Paz  Ontex’s CEO  said “The solid improvement in the Group’s performance has continued during the first quarter with strong revenue growth cementing the momentum delivered throughout last year. Most importantly  we have turned the corner in the restoration of margins and thereby pursued the process of bringing down the leverage ratio through higher profitability. These results and the completion of the Mexican divestment are another positive step  as we accelerate our efforts to simplify our operations  increase efficiencies  strengthen relations with our customers  and secure our financing.”Key Q1 2023 FINANCIALSKey indicatorsKey indicators First quarter in € million 2023 2022 % % LFL Core Markets (continuing operations) Revenue 445.9 384.7 +16% +15% Baby Care 195.1 176.4 +11% +10% Adult Care 183.0 149.1 +23% +22% Feminine Care 61.3 52.6 +17% +16% Adj.

In baby care revenue grew 10% like for like compared to last year  driven by continued volume growth of baby pants. In adult care revenue growth was 22% like for like  and also up quarter on quarter based on solid demand  both in healthcare and in retail channels. Feminine care revenue grew 16% like for like. Including favorable forex  total revenue growth was up 16% year on year  and 3% lower compared to the fourth quarter of 2022  reflecting more pronounced seasonality.Volume and mix changes had no significant net impact. In Europe the product mix improved  including higher growth of baby pants and adult care. Volumes were stable  compared to the first quarter of 2022 which was boosted by price-driven forward-buying of customers. Market demand continues to be supportive for retail brands  gaining market share in an overall flat market. Ontex volumes in North America reduced in the quarter  due to more pronounced destocking at certain lifestyle customers  also affecting the product mix.Prices were up 15% on average versus last year  with double digit price increases in all categories and major regions. Following the huge increase in raw material and other input costs  Ontex steadily rolled out price increases over the course of 2022 to mitigate the impact. While the majority of the pricing in this quarter is the effect of this  Ontex continued to execute additional pricing to recover cumulative cost inflation.Forex fluctuations had slight positive impact of 1%. The year-on-year appreciation of the Russian ruble and US dollar more than offset the depreciation of the British pound.Adjusted EBITDA of Core Markets (continuing operations)Adjusted EBITDA of Core Markets was €41 million  up 95% year on year. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 it was largely stable  offsetting continued sequential cost inflation with pricing and productivity gains. Adjusted EBITDA margin rose to 9.1%  by 3.7pp year on year and 0.4pp quarter on quarter.While there was no volume and mix effect on revenue  the improvement of the product mix  including in adult care and baby pants  had a €5 million positive impact on the EBITDA.Operating cost reduction measures represented €16 million in savings  a reduction of the operational cost base by close to 5%. Procurement initiatives and operational efficiency were the main drivers behind the improvement. While slightly up in line with inflation  mostly on wages  SG&A costs over sales were kept below 10%.Cost inflation weighed heavily on the year-on-year comparison  with a negative impact of €38 million from raw materials  especially on fluff and super-absorbent-polymers  and €17 million from other operating costs  including wage inflation. While the year-on-year increase is slowing versus the peak in the third quarter of 2022  it still marks a significant increase compared to the fourth quarter of last year  following the contract renewals at the start of the year. The total cost base went up by close to 20% versus the first quarter of 2022.The strong continued pricing contributed €58 million year on year. While this offset the additional input cost inflation versus the previous year for the first time overall  it does not cover the cumulative cost increase incurred since the start of the inflation wave in 2021 in all markets and categories. Thereby continued adjustments including selective pricing is required.Forex fluctuations had a €2 million net negative impact as the positive impact on revenue was more than offset by the year-on-year US dollar appreciation effect on input costs.Total Group (including discontinued operations)Discontinued operations  consisting of the Emerging Markets division  generated a revenue of €206 million  up 17% like for like compared with last year  driven mostly by pricing across regions. Lower volumes in Mexico and the Middle East were offset by volume growth in Brazil and a general mix improvement. Overall revenue growth was 22% year on year  thanks to positive forex fluctuations  with the appreciation of the Mexican peso and Brazilian real more than offsetting the depreciation and hyperinflation impact of the Turkish lira. Adjusted EBITDA came in at €15 million  versus €4 million in 2022  and marking a further increase of 37% versus the fourth quarter of last year. The adjusted EBITDA margin of 7.3%  is up 5.1pp year on year and 2.2pp quarter on quarter.Total Group revenue was €652 million  up 16% like for like versus the first quarter of 2022 and 18% overall. Price increases represented the bulk of this at 15%  volume and mix was overall stable and forex fluctuations had a positive impact. Adjusted EBITDA came in at €56 million  up 126% year on year  and 9% quarter on quarter pursuing the recovery shown since Q3 2022. The sales price increase of €85 million offset the €83 million increase of input cost prices. The mix improvement contributed €15 million and gross operating savings €20 million  whereas SG&A was up €9 million reflecting mostly wage inflation. The EBITDA margin thereby rose to 8.5%  up 4.1pp year on year  and 1.0pp quarter on quarter.Q1 2023 FINANCIAL REVIEWCash and balance sheetNet financial debt for the total Group was €880 million at the end of March  not including the proceeds from the Mexican business divestment  compared to €867 million at the start of the year. While EBITDA of the Total Group was up significantly year on year  including €10 million of restructuring and divestment charges  capex increased as anticipated to more than 3% of sales. Financing costs were up reflecting the rise in interest rates on the floating rate portion of the debt  and included the semi-annual coupon payment on the fixed rate bond. Working capital needs increased mainly due to the impact of higher quarter-on-quarter input costs.The leverage ratio decreased further to 5.3x from 6.4x at the end of December 2022  and the peak of 7.7x at the end of September before that. The strong increase in adjusted EBITDA over the last quarters has been driving this reduction in leverage.Following the finalization of the Mexican business divestment  the net proceeds received at closing amounted to approximately €225 million  after deduction of taxes  transaction and hedging expenses as well as balance sheet adjustments. These remain subject to the customary post-closing adjustments. The transaction also includes an additional deferred payment to be received in the next five years of some €40 million  bringing the total net proceeds to approximately €265 million.The divestment proceeds  will be used to reimburse the €220 million term loan by mid-May. This will substantially strengthen Ontex’s debt position with the fixed rate bond at 3.5%  representing about 75% of total gross financial debt excluding leases.DisclaimerThis report may include forward-looking statements.

These solutions enable Thales to analyse suspicious behaviour and unexpected traffic to and from the external network and to detect malicious activity targeting industrial information systems.Thales is a market leader in security for critical industrial systems. OT network sensors from Nozomi Networks will be used at its National Digital Exploitation Centre (NDEC) in Wales and will soon be deployed at the new NDEC that opened in Canada on 23 April 2023. The partnership expands Thales's expertise in network monitoring and cyberthreat detection and response for critical industrial infrastructure. The network sensors developed by Nozomi Networks and their ability to parse large numbers of industrial protocols make it possible to visualise network traffic with a high degree of precision  provide detailed identification of industrial assets and detect operational anomalies caused by known as well as unknown cyberthreats.Companies with an OT infrastructure  particularly in the manufacturing  automation and transportation industries  have little or no scope for operational downtime and are therefore highly vulnerable to cyberattacks. Attacks are rarely identical  so they are difficult to anticipate  making it especially important to improve the resilience of these companies' industrial systems. Network sensors are positioned at critical points on the network in order to quickly identify attacks and initiate appropriate action in a timely fashion.1 CSPN: Certification de Sécurité de Premier Niveau (Level 1 security certification) by the French national cybersecurity agency (ANSSI)About ThalesThales (Euronext Paris: HO) is a global leader in advanced technologies within three domains: Defence & Security  Aeronautics & Space  and Digital Identity & Security.

After fantastic first two quarters  also during the third quarter  we continued having very strong order intake and revenue generation  in particular for our Location Intelligence Services. Costs remain well under control  with a slight reduction compared with the previous year  despite the substantial growth in revenues and operational activities. In the first nine months  all business and financial key performance indicators remain positive  including EBITDA  EBIT and Cash Flow  confirming the trajectory indicated in the previous quarters.”The current financial year covers the 12 months period from 1 July 2022 to 30 June 2023. The first nine months cover the period from 1 July 2022 to 31 March 2023 and Q3 covers the 3 months period from January 2023 to March 2023.In the first nine months of FY 2022-23  GeoJunxion’s business continued with a strong performance: Revenue grew sharply (+60%) compared to the same period of the previous financial year. Order intake maintained a positive trajectory: the third quarter was in line with the results achieved in the same period of the previous year; while year to date  order intake is more than double compared with the same period of FY 2021/22. In Q3 FY 2022/23  operational expenses increased 10% compared with the same period in 2021/22  however this is justified given the 50% revenue growth in the quarter and 60% revenue growth for the first nine months. This resulted in a reduction of 2% for Net Operating Expenses  when compared with the first nine months of the previous financial year. The operating result  the result before tax  and the Net Profit are all positive. While the cash flow for the Q3 was slightly negative by €54K  the nine months still resulted in an overall positive cash flow of €444K. It’s also worth noting that the slightly negative cash flow for the quarter is due to timing; something that will be recovered during the course of the last quarter of the financial year.FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Q3 (January ‘23 - March ‘23) and the first 9 months of F.Y. 2022/23 (July ‘22 - March ‘23) vs same period in 2021/226 0 % revenue growth for the for the first 9 months of F.Y. 2022/23 (50% growth in Q3 2022-23) compared to the same period in 2021/22;for the for the first 9 months of F.Y. 2022/23 (50% growth in Q3 2022-23) compared to the same period in 2021/22; 2 % reduction in Net Operational Expenses ( OPEX ) for the 1H 2022/23 (10% increase in Q3 2022-’23);in Net Operational Expenses ( ) for the 1H 2022/23 (10% increase in Q3 2022-’23); EBITDA and EB I T positive in the first 9 months of F.Y. 2022/23 by respectively €1.499K and €790K;in the first 9 months of F.Y. 2022/23 by respectively €1.499K and €790K; Net Profit after tax of €4 03 K in the first 9 months of F.Y. 2022/23  compared to a Net Loss of €610K in the same period of FY 2021/22;the first 9 months of F.Y. 2022/23  compared to a Net Loss of €610K in the same period of FY 2021/22; Positive Cash Flow of €444K in the first 9 months of F.Y. 2022/23  compared to €79K in the same period of F.Y. 2021/22.Note: the positive sign in the variation % means improvement period over periodOUTLOOK FOR THE ACCOUNTING YEAR 2022-2023GeoJunxion is very pleased to increase  once again  the outlook for the accounting year 2022-’23: At the end of H1 FY 2022/23  we increased our topline growth to 30-35%. At this point in time  we expect an even more positive trajectory  with our topline to grow by 35-40% compared to last year. This expectation is built primarily on orders already booked and; to a much lesser extent  on a pipeline of opportunities from existing and new customers. With this improved topline  EBITDA  EBIT net income and Cash flow are expected to be positive.OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS AND STRATEGY UPDATEStrategy UpdateGeoJunxion’s strategy remains focused on creating “map agnostic” data products: digital geo-localized content  designed to be fully integrated into or overlaid on any commercial or open-source maps  or to be utilised in developing smart solutions for a large variety of use cases  in multiple industries and market sectors.Our strategy is solid as it has delivered year-over-year growth of +40% during the last 36 months. We will therefore continue to diligently execute on this strategy and expand the scope of our existing product portfolio and services.During the last quarter of the financial year  great attention and dedication will continue to be paid to the existing clients (Global Tech Companies) in executing custom Location Intelligence services and extending the scope of those projects.GeoJunxion’s activities are directed towards establishing long-term relationships with our customers  through the creation of recurring business models rather than opportunistic one-off contracts. Although the relationship with clients frequently starts with a proof-of-concept or a custom one-off project  most of the Company’s efforts go into building value-added  dynamic content  requiring continuous and frequent updates to maintain and increase their value over time. This means that most of our proof-of-concept and one-off projects are a launch-pad for establishing a service or license contract  converting the initial activities into a recurring  more predictable and sustainable business model.When executing projects  GeoJunxion typically retains the Intellectual Property and ownership of the newly developed datasets and solutions  for licensing to other customers. Thereby  leveraging the initial investment and creating a virtuous business cycle.Our mission remains focused on improving navigational safety and enhancing people mobility  contributing to a more sustainable world  reducing the impact on the environment  through intelligent solutions enabling more environmentally conscious decisions through informed choices.Central to GeoJunxion’s strategy are:Cost effective research  sourcing  production  ingestion  and aggregation of geodataFlexible licensing models at competitive pricingDirect delivery of dynamic  up-to-date content via APIsHighly flexible solutions and content creationMarket DevelopmentsWhile existing and prospective clients strictly monitor their expenditures and continue to be prudent in contracting projects  we are experiencing a growing interest in our Location Intelligence Services and last-mile mapping.In regard to some of the geopolitical challenges  GeoJunxion has no direct impact as a result of the war in Ukraine. Like others  we are susceptible to rising inflation  resulting from increased energy and other raw material prices. This does impact salaries  staff expenses  office costs and other indirect services. However  as already mentioned  such costs remain under control due to continuous and diligent monitoring.We also remark on the interest in and demand for location-aware content despite the concerns about the health of the global economy. While many big Companies in the last 6 to 12 months are making reductions in their respective workforces and cutting costs  GeoJunxion remains positive  having strengthened the team in recent years  with key hires necessary to drive growth and deliver strong results.The largest market opportunity for GeoJunxion remains by far with big Tech Companies  making extensive use of geo-localized data for their business and end-user solutions. In this market segment  we are dedicating a significant portion of our resources to project execution. We booked and executed sizable projects in all previous quarters  awarded project extensions and booked new opportunities also in the third quarter.In the automotive industry we confirm the previously announced interest derived from the adoption of advanced driver-assistance systems  such as ISA (Intelligent Speed Assistance). We confirm a growing demand for more cost-effective mapping solutions  with the most up-to-date and relevant content. This consideration is valid for the leisure market as well as for commercial heavy vehicle applications. Premium content pertaining to road safety and environmental sustainability remains our major interest and focus for product development.GeoJunxion also remains active in identifying opportunities in more traditional markets  such as Transport & Logistics  Real Estate  Geo-Marketing  Business Analysis  Travel & Tourism  as well as Public Administration. In the last quarter  Transport & Logistics and Business Analytics were the most active sectors.Business DevelopmentIn the third quarter of FY 2022-23  as well as for the entire fiscal year to date (9 months)  the Location Intelligence Services continued playing an essential role in our business development. The scope of certain projects awarded at the beginning of this financial year was extended and executed in the third quarter. Some of them are still on-going and will be complete in this Q4. As said  also in Q3 we have been awarded for new Location Intelligence projects. These contracts will continue to convert into revenue during this final quarter of the Financial Year 2022/23.During Q3  our Sales and Business development teams had the opportunity to attend more trade events in person. Meeting with partners and clients face to face  to promote GeoJunxion’s brand  its products and services. We also attended the Autonomy Mobility World Expo in Paris  in the Dutch Pavilion  as part of the Dutch delegation of Companies promoting their solutions to the mobility market. We give thanks to the Dutch Embassy in Paris and all the people that contributed to the organization of this important event.Business Development has been also very much focused on developing new solutions for the last-mile mapping market. In this regard  Altamura Francesco  GeoJunxion CBO & MD says: “last-mile mapping is an area that continues to interest our customers. We are extending our intentions from Outdoor only to Outdoor and Indoor custom maps  location positioning solutions  location analytics and  possibly  location marketing”.In order to reinforce our capability to deliver state-of-the-art last-mile mapping solutions  GeoJunxion established a partnership with WizzyMaps during the third quarter of the financial year. This collaboration delivered a solution for the Netherlands-Gibraltar football match qualifier and a last-mile interactive  navigable map for the Zuiderzee Museum.Zuiderzee Museum last-mile mapProduct DevelopmentCustom project executionWe continue to put significant efforts into the development of proprietary location intelligence content for a global Tech Company. The first project; announced in August ’22  has been extended in scope  and therefore continued into Q3. In the second quarter  additional projects for global Tech Companies have been added to our workload. Their execution has mostly been completed but there are some that are still in progress which are expected to be completed during the Q3 or Q4 of F.Y. 2022/23. In addition  there are other projects which are in the negotiation or in scope definition phase.Automotive product developmentOn the R&D side  a significant part of product development was focused on the execution and refinement of the data for a leading Infotainment System manufacturer. The first phase of this project; announced in April 2022 is now complete and we are currently working on defining the scope of the next phase  with the intent to industrialize the process and extend the development to new areas.Eco Alert Zones and School Safety ZonesSmart Geofences are key products in the GeoJunxion’s portfolio. Eco Alert Zones and School Safety Zones have been kept up to date during the course of the last quarter. They are increasing in number  geographical coverage and also in the type of areas.As announced during the last AGM we are working on an innovative proof of concept project with the intent to develop deep learning methods in the field of satellite imagery analysis and object recognition. This activity will continue for the entire year 2023  but it’s already delivering interesting preliminary results. This will give us the possibility to further enrich our existing datasets of geofences and create new ones.ORDER INTAKEOrder intake continued with a positive trend. The first two quarters have been exceptionally good  with Q1 being delivering the highest result compared to previous years. Q3 was also strong despite being slightly lower when compared to the same period last year. This resulted in the value of orders booked during the first nine months of the financial year 2022/23 to be more than double of those booked in the same period of the last accounting year.REVENUEIn Q3 2022/23  revenue increased by +50%. In Q2 the growth was of 45% in recurring revenue and 17% in non-recurring revenue. Q3 showed again growth in all product lines. Recurring revenue grew of 31% and non-recurring revenue 60% compared to the same period of last year. We are encouraged to see both product lines increasing in revenues  in particular the growth of the recurring product lines.In the first nine months of FY 2022/23  revenue increased by 60%. Also  during the same period  growth has been realized in all our product lines  with recurring revenue growing by almost 25% and non-recurring revenue growing by approximately 80%.GeoJunxion tracks its revenue by product and service type and by the nature of the underlying contract (recurring versus non-recurring). The main revenue growth has been realized in non-recurring location services  but also the recurring revenue from licenses and royalties showed an increase. The recurring service revenue grew as well as expected and announced at the end of the previous quarter. Recurring service revenue includes the updating services of our Eco Alert Zones product and other data products. The non-recurring service revenue includes tailored research and collection of data sets and creation of geo-located content.OPERATING RESULTThe Q3 2022-23 operating result shows a small loss of €7K  compared to a loss of €187K during the same quarter last year. This confirms the positive trend which already started in the prior quarters. There are two main drivers for this year-over-year improvement:50% increase in revenue to €750K (vs €500K  PY)a limited increase of 10% in the net operational expenses  despite strong inflationary pressures and the increase of 50% in revenue for the quarter.Higher Capitalized development costs +€23K (+17%) due to ongoing investments in new products and coverage extension of existing productsThe first nine months of FY 2022-23 operating result shows an operating profit €790K  compared to a loss of €372K during the same period of last year. The main drivers for such a positive result are similar to those mentioned for the quarterly improvement:60% increase in revenue to €2.962K (vs €1.854K  PY)2% decrease in net operational expenses. This is remarkable  considering inflationary pressures and the 60% increase in revenueHigher Capitalized development costs +€119K (+31%) due to ongoing investments in new products and coverage extension of existing products.ORGANIZATIONAs already remarked in the past quarter  GeoJunxion has achieved Level 2 certification on Social Entrepreneurship: the Prestatieladder Socialer Ondernemen. This independent assessment showed that GeoJunxion offers high-quality employment to people who have difficulty accessing the labor market and collaborating with like-minded organizations. With this certification  GeoJunxion provides an above-average contribution in the field of social entrepreneurship in a sustainable way.During the third quarter  GeoJunxion confirmed its attention to sensitive matters with social impact  supporting the Dutch Heart Foundation in its program to achieve the goal of “a healthy heart for everyone”. GeoJunxion cares about its employees  their health  working conditions and encourages all of them to adopt a healthy lifestyle.FINANCIAL POSITIONGeoJunxion has made great progress in turning its business around from a digital map supplier to a premium location content and location intelligence service provider with subscription based  recurring “data as a service” revenue models. The results reported for the first 9 months of FY 2022-23  with growing revenue and a net profit for the period  are evidence of this progress. Based on our current outlook  the available cash on hand is estimated to be sufficient to cover our operational requirements for at least the next 12 months.APPOINTMENT OF EXTERNAL AUDITORIn the past few months  we have had extensive discussions with OOB/PIE licensed auditing companies. In spite of improved financial results  positive cash flows  improved governance & internal control processes  none of the auditing companies contacted was willing to provide a quotation for performing the audit work. The main reasons given by the auditing firms are the lack of internal staff capacity to execute the work and the limited size of the company and its market capitalization.After the expiry of the 24-months period given by Euronext Amsterdam  on 13 April 2023  we received a letter from Euronext confirming ongoing non-compliance and their intention to proceed with the delisting process. We have formally objected to this decision from Euronext. In parallel we continue working to find alternative solutions  exploring various possible paths  with the intent to secure a solid future for the Company  in the best interest of all stakeholders involved.RISK MANAGEMENTRisk management is an integral managerial task. Our risk management and control procedures take into consideration the size of the company and the character of the business to identify the most significant risks which the company is exposed to.

GeoJunxion CBO & MD Francesco Altamura: ""We are extremely happy about the positive direction our business is evolving in this financial year 2022/23. After fantastic first two quarters  also during the third quarter  we continued having very strong order intake and revenue generation  in particular for our Location Intelligence Services. Costs remain well under control  with a slight reduction compared with the previous year  despite the substantial growth in revenues and operational activities. In the first nine months  all business and financial key performance indicators remain positive  including EBITDA  EBIT and Cash Flow  confirming the trajectory indicated in the previous quarters.” The current financial year covers the 12 months period from 1 July 2022 to 30 June 2023. The first nine months cover the period from 1 July 2022 to 31 March 2023 and Q3 covers the 3 months period from January 2023 to March 2023. In the first nine months of FY 2022-23  GeoJunxion’s business continued with a strong performance: Revenue grew sharply (+60%) compared to the same period of the previous financial year. Order intake maintained a positive trajectory: the third quarter was in line with the results achieved in the same period of the previous year; while year to date  order intake is more than double compared with the same period of FY 2021/22. In Q3 FY 2022/23  operational expenses increased 10% compared with the same period in 2021/22  however this is justified given the 50% revenue growth in the quarter and 60% revenue growth for the first nine months. This resulted in a reduction of 2% for Net Operating Expenses  when compared with the first nine months of the previous financial year. The operating result  the result before tax  and the Net Profit are all positive. While the cash flow for the Q3 was slightly negative by €54K  the nine months still resulted in an overall positive cash flow of €444K. It’s also worth noting that the slightly negative cash flow for the quarter is due to timing; something that will be recovered during the course of the last quarter of the financial year. FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Q3 (January ‘23 - March ‘23) and the first 9 months of F.Y. 2022/23 (July ‘22 - March ‘23) vs same period in 2021/22 6 0 % revenue growth for the for the first 9 months of F.Y. 2022/23 (50% growth in Q3 2022-23) compared to the same period in 2021/22;for the for the first 9 months of F.Y. 2022/23 (50% growth in Q3 2022-23) compared to the same period in 2021/22; 2 % reduction in Net Operational Expenses ( OPEX ) for the 1H 2022/23 (10% increase in Q3 2022-’23);in Net Operational Expenses ( ) for the 1H 2022/23 (10% increase in Q3 2022-’23); EBITDA and EB I T positive in the first 9 months of F.Y. 2022/23 by respectively €1.499K and €790K;in the first 9 months of F.Y. 2022/23 by respectively €1.499K and €790K; Net Profit after tax of €4 03 K in the first 9 months of F.Y. 2022/23  compared to a Net Loss of €610K in the same period of FY 2021/22;the first 9 months of F.Y. 2022/23  compared to a Net Loss of €610K in the same period of FY 2021/22; Positive Cash Flow of €444K in the first 9 months of F.Y. 2022/23  compared to €79K in the same period of F.Y. 2021/22.Note: the positive sign in the variation % means improvement period over period OUTLOOK FOR THE ACCOUNTING YEAR 2022-2023 GeoJunxion is very pleased to increase  once again  the outlook for the accounting year 2022-’23: At the end of H1 FY 2022/23  we increased our topline growth to 30-35%. At this point in time  we expect an even more positive trajectory  with our topline to grow by 35-40% compared to last year. This expectation is built primarily on orders already booked and; to a much lesser extent  on a pipeline of opportunities from existing and new customers. With this improved topline  EBITDA  EBIT net income and Cash flow are expected to be positive. OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS AND STRATEGY UPDATE Strategy Update GeoJunxion’s strategy remains focused on creating “map agnostic” data products: digital geo-localized content  designed to be fully integrated into or overlaid on any commercial or open-source maps  or to be utilised in developing smart solutions for a large variety of use cases  in multiple industries and market sectors. Our strategy is solid as it has delivered year-over-year growth of +40% during the last 36 months. We will therefore continue to diligently execute on this strategy and expand the scope of our existing product portfolio and services. During the last quarter of the financial year  great attention and dedication will continue to be paid to the existing clients (Global Tech Companies) in executing custom Location Intelligence services and extending the scope of those projects.

When executing projects  GeoJunxion typically retains the Intellectual Property and ownership of the newly developed datasets and solutions  for licensing to other customers. Thereby  leveraging the initial investment and creating a virtuous business cycle. Our mission remains focused on improving navigational safety and enhancing people mobility  contributing to a more sustainable world  reducing the impact on the environment  through intelligent solutions enabling more environmentally conscious decisions through informed choices. Central to GeoJunxion’s strategy are: Cost effective research  sourcing  production  ingestion  and aggregation of geodataFlexible licensing models at competitive pricingDirect delivery of dynamic  up-to-date content via APIsHighly flexible solutions and content creation Market Developments While existing and prospective clients strictly monitor their expenditures and continue to be prudent in contracting projects  we are experiencing a growing interest in our Location Intelligence Services and last-mile mapping.

Zuiderzee Museum last-mile map Product Development Custom project executionWe continue to put significant efforts into the development of proprietary location intelligence content for a global Tech Company. The first project; announced in August ’22  has been extended in scope  and therefore continued into Q3. In the second quarter  additional projects for global Tech Companies have been added to our workload. Their execution has mostly been completed but there are some that are still in progress which are expected to be completed during the Q3 or Q4 of F.Y. 2022/23. In addition  there are other projects which are in the negotiation or in scope definition phase. Automotive product developmentOn the R&D side  a significant part of product development was focused on the execution and refinement of the data for a leading Infotainment System manufacturer. The first phase of this project; announced in April 2022 is now complete and we are currently working on defining the scope of the next phase  with the intent to industrialize the process and extend the development to new areas. Eco Alert Zones and School Safety ZonesSmart Geofences are key products in the GeoJunxion’s portfolio. Eco Alert Zones and School Safety Zones have been kept up to date during the course of the last quarter. They are increasing in number  geographical coverage and also in the type of areas. As announced during the last AGM we are working on an innovative proof of concept project with the intent to develop deep learning methods in the field of satellite imagery analysis and object recognition. This activity will continue for the entire year 2023  but it’s already delivering interesting preliminary results. This will give us the possibility to further enrich our existing datasets of geofences and create new ones. ORDER INTAKE Order intake continued with a positive trend. The first two quarters have been exceptionally good  with Q1 being delivering the highest result compared to previous years. Q3 was also strong despite being slightly lower when compared to the same period last year. This resulted in the value of orders booked during the first nine months of the financial year 2022/23 to be more than double of those booked in the same period of the last accounting year. REVENUE In Q3 2022/23  revenue increased by +50%. In Q2 the growth was of 45% in recurring revenue and 17% in non-recurring revenue. Q3 showed again growth in all product lines. Recurring revenue grew of 31% and non-recurring revenue 60% compared to the same period of last year. We are encouraged to see both product lines increasing in revenues  in particular the growth of the recurring product lines. In the first nine months of FY 2022/23  revenue increased by 60%. Also  during the same period  growth has been realized in all our product lines  with recurring revenue growing by almost 25% and non-recurring revenue growing by approximately 80%. GeoJunxion tracks its revenue by product and service type and by the nature of the underlying contract (recurring versus non-recurring). The main revenue growth has been realized in non-recurring location services  but also the recurring revenue from licenses and royalties showed an increase. The recurring service revenue grew as well as expected and announced at the end of the previous quarter. Recurring service revenue includes the updating services of our Eco Alert Zones product and other data products. The non-recurring service revenue includes tailored research and collection of data sets and creation of geo-located content. OPERATING RESULT The Q3 2022-23 operating result shows a small loss of €7K  compared to a loss of €187K during the same quarter last year. This confirms the positive trend which already started in the prior quarters. There are two main drivers for this year-over-year improvement: 50% increase in revenue to €750K (vs €500K  PY)a limited increase of 10% in the net operational expenses  despite strong inflationary pressures and the increase of 50% in revenue for the quarter.Higher Capitalized development costs +€23K (+17%) due to ongoing investments in new products and coverage extension of existing productsThe first nine months of FY 2022-23 operating result shows an operating profit €790K  compared to a loss of €372K during the same period of last year. The main drivers for such a positive result are similar to those mentioned for the quarterly improvement: 60% increase in revenue to €2.962K (vs €1.854K  PY)2% decrease in net operational expenses. This is remarkable  considering inflationary pressures and the 60% increase in revenueHigher Capitalized development costs +€119K (+31%) due to ongoing investments in new products and coverage extension of existing products.ORGANIZATION As already remarked in the past quarter  GeoJunxion has achieved Level 2 certification on Social Entrepreneurship: the Prestatieladder Socialer Ondernemen. This independent assessment showed that GeoJunxion offers high-quality employment to people who have difficulty accessing the labor market and collaborating with like-minded organizations. With this certification  GeoJunxion provides an above-average contribution in the field of social entrepreneurship in a sustainable way. During the third quarter  GeoJunxion confirmed its attention to sensitive matters with social impact  supporting the Dutch Heart Foundation in its program to achieve the goal of “a healthy heart for everyone”. GeoJunxion cares about its employees  their health  working conditions and encourages all of them to adopt a healthy lifestyle. FINANCIAL POSITION GeoJunxion has made great progress in turning its business around from a digital map supplier to a premium location content and location intelligence service provider with subscription based  recurring “data as a service” revenue models. The results reported for the first 9 months of FY 2022-23  with growing revenue and a net profit for the period  are evidence of this progress. Based on our current outlook  the available cash on hand is estimated to be sufficient to cover our operational requirements for at least the next 12 months. APPOINTMENT OF EXTERNAL AUDITOR In the past few months  we have had extensive discussions with OOB/PIE licensed auditing companies. In spite of improved financial results  positive cash flows  improved governance & internal control processes  none of the auditing companies contacted was willing to provide a quotation for performing the audit work. The main reasons given by the auditing firms are the lack of internal staff capacity to execute the work and the limited size of the company and its market capitalization. After the expiry of the 24-months period given by Euronext Amsterdam  on 13 April 2023  we received a letter from Euronext confirming ongoing non-compliance and their intention to proceed with the delisting process. We have formally objected to this decision from Euronext. In parallel we continue working to find alternative solutions  exploring various possible paths  with the intent to secure a solid future for the Company  in the best interest of all stakeholders involved. RISK MANAGEMENT Risk management is an integral managerial task. Our risk management and control procedures take into consideration the size of the company and the character of the business to identify the most significant risks which the company is exposed to. The risks identified are discussed on a periodical basis and mitigated or fully resolved  where possible. Such a system cannot provide absolute certainty that objectives will be realized. Neither can it guarantee prevention of potential cases of material mistakes  damage  fraud  or breaches of statutory laws. The 2021-22 Annual Report; as published on 27 October 2022  describes the primary strategic  operational  and financial risks. The risks and uncertainties described in the Annual Report are relevant and are deemed incorporated and repeated by reference in this report. There were no cases of material damage  fraud or breaches of law detected since issuing the Annual Accounts. Our people are our key assets  and we do our utmost to keep them engaged  safe and healthy.

To be able to respond quickly and appropriately  we are placing the emphasis in our revised strategy on local approach and responsibility. Market position and returns are important to us. That is why we have recently started a reorganization  so that the local approach can be implemented effectively and efficiently. Knowledge  innovative power and focus on cost reduction are key drivers. After all  volumes are under pressure  as they were in the first quarter. This is mainly due to the impact of bird flu in the United Kingdom and Poland and the crisis in the pig sector. However  the good result in the ruminant sector in the first quarter in the United Kingdom was gratifying. To contribute to the transition of the sector  we must continue to innovate and therefore also to make returns. These are basic preconditions. My colleagues and I are convinced that we can make the adjustments in our approach and business operations and that we can include current and new customers in this transition.

Our objective is to continue driving these sales in 2023 and  at the same time  continue to build a stronger vaccine portfolio and pipeline. As we approach our ten-year anniversary  we look forward to celebrating another major milestone with the potential approval of our chikungunya vaccine candidate in the U.S. later this year.”Story continuesClinical Stage Vaccine CandidatesCHIKUNGUNYA VACCINE CANDIDATE – VLA1553FDA Mid-cycle review meeting for Biologics License Application (BLA) completedVLA1553 is a live-attenuated  single-dose vaccine candidate against the chikungunya virus (CHIKV)  a mosquito-borne virus that has spread to more than 110 countries2 with the potential to rapidly expand further. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) issued an epidemiological alert in February 2023 as the number of cases and deaths due to chikungunya continues to rise in the Americas3. With no preventive vaccine or specific treatment yet available  chikungunya is considered a major public health threat.In February 2023  the FDA accepted the filing of a BLA for approval of VLA1553 in persons aged 18 years and above4  and at a recent mid-cycle review meeting  indicated that no significant review or safety concerns were noted. The FDA confirmed the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) review goal date at the end of August 2023  on which an approval decision on the VLA1553 BLA is expected.VLA1553 is currently the only chikungunya vaccine candidate worldwide for which a regulatory review process is underway5 and  if approved  it could become the first licensed chikungunya vaccine available to address this unmet medical need. It would also represent the third vaccine Valneva6 has brought from early R&D to approval. The sponsor of the first chikungunya vaccine approved in the U.S. is eligible to receive a Priority Review Voucher (PRV)7.Valneva’s BLA application follows final pivotal Phase 3 data in March 20228  final lot-to-lot consistency results in May 20229 and positive twelve-month persistence data in December 202210. A clinical study of VLA1553 in adolescents is ongoing in Brazil11  for which Valneva reported enrollment and vaccination completion in February 202312. This trial  conducted by Valneva’s partner Instituto Butantan and funded by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI)  may support future regulatory submissions in this age group  if VLA1553 is initially approved in adults  as well as licensure of the vaccine in Europe and Brazil  which would be the first potential approval for use in an endemic population. Topline results are expected mid-2023.The program received FDA Fast Track  Breakthrough Therapy and Priority Review designations in 2018  2021 and 2023  respectively. VLA1553 was also granted PRIority MEdicine (PRIME) designation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2020. Valneva currently plans to make additional regulatory submissions for VLA1553 in Canada  Europe and the United Kingdom in 2023.LYME DISEASE VACCINE CANDIDATE – VLA15Phase 3 study ongoingValneva and Pfizer are developing VLA15  a Lyme disease vaccine candidate that targets the outer surface protein A (OspA) of Borrelia burgdorferi  the bacterium that causes Lyme disease. VLA15 is a multivalent recombinant protein vaccine that targets six serotypes of Borrelia representing the most common strains found in North America and Europe. VLA15 is the only Lyme disease vaccine program in advanced clinical development today and has received Fast Track designation from the FDA.Valneva and Pfizer reported results for three Phase 2 clinical trials of VLA15 in both adult and pediatric populations  in which high levels of antibodies against all six strains were observed13 14 15. In August 2022  the companies initiated a Phase 3 clinical study  ""Vaccine Against Lyme for Outdoor Recreationists (VALOR)""  to investigate the efficacy  safety and immunogenicity of VLA15 in participants five years of age and older in highly endemic regions in the United States and Europe16.The VALOR study is currently ongoing and  as communicated in February 2023  Pfizer had to discontinue approximately half of the total recruited participants in the trial following violations of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) at certain trial sites in the U.S. run by a third-party trial site operator. The clinical trial remains ongoing with other sites not operated by the third party  and Pfizer continues to enroll new participants at those sites in addition to newly added sites in the U.S. and Canada. The original study design and endpoints previously agreed with regulators have not changed.Currently enrolled participants will receive their booster vaccination as planned in the second quarter of 2024 in advance of the 2024 tick season. Additional enrollment for primary immunization will begin in the second quarter of 2023 with overall trial continuation to include the 2025 tick season.As a result  Pfizer is aiming to submit a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2026  subject to positive data. Current projected incremental study execution costs incurred due to the agreed amount of additional enrollment will be borne by Pfizer”.Pre-Clinical Vaccine CandidatesValneva continues to progress select pre-clinical assets and focus on strengthening its future clinical pipeline. The Company is currently focused on VLA2112  a vaccine candidate targeting the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)  which is one of the most common human viruses. EBV can cause infectious mononucleosis17 and is strongly associated with the development of several types of cancer18 and multiple sclerosis19. Valneva is also developing a vaccine candidate targeting the human metapneumovirus (hMPV)  which is a major worldwide respiratory pathogen that causes acute upper and lower respiratory tract infection20  and is currently exploring potential partnering opportunities. Additionally  Valneva initiated pre-clinical work on vaccine candidates targeting parvovirus B19  a virus  which can cause hydrops fetalis in pregnant women and aplastic crisis in persons with anemia21  as well as Campylobacter  a bacterium often associated with food poisoning22.Commercial VaccinesJAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS VACCINE (IXIARO®/JESPECT®)IXIARO® is an inactivated Vero cell culture-derived Japanese encephalitis that is the only Japanese encephalitis vaccine licensed and available in the United States  Canada and Europe. IXIARO® is indicated for active immunization against Japanese encephalitis  the most prevalent cause of viral encephalitis in Asia  for adults  adolescents  children and infants aged two months and older.IXIARO®/JESPECT® sales were €17.4 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared to €4.2 million in the first quarter of 2022. This 315.2% sales increase was driven by the significant recovery of the private travel markets following the decline of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as price increases. Valneva has started discussions with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and expects to sign a new contract with the DoD in the coming months.Valneva is also exploring options for its Almeida manufacturing facility in Livingston (Scotland)  initially built to produce its COVID-19 vaccine  including a possible sale or a repurposing to produce IXIARO® and its chikungunya vaccine  if approved.CHOLERA / ETEC23-DIARRHEA VACCINE (DUKORAL®)DUKORAL® is an oral vaccine for the prevention of diarrhea caused by Vibrio cholerae and/or heat-labile toxin producing ETEC24  the leading cause of travelers’ diarrhea. DUKORAL® is authorized for use in the European Union and Australia to protect against cholera  and in Canada  Switzerland  New Zealand and Thailand to protect against cholera and ETEC.DUKORAL® sales increased by 302.6% to €10.2 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared to €2.5 million in the first quarter of 2022  also benefitting from the significant recovery in the private travel markets as well as price increases.THIRD-PARTY DISTRIBUTIONValneva distributes certain third-party vaccines in countries where it operates its own marketing and sales infrastructure. In the first quarter of 2023  Valneva’s third party product sales were €4.5 million compared to €5.6 million in the first quarter of 2022.First Quarter 2023 Financial Review(Unaudited  consolidated under IFRS)RevenuesValneva’s total revenues were €33.5 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared to €21.8 million in the first quarter of 2022  an increase of 53.4%.Valneva’s total product sales reached €32.1 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared to €16.2 million in the first quarter of 2022  an increase of 98.6%. This was driven by a continued recovery of travel vaccine sales. On a constant exchange rate (CER) basis  product sales increased by 101.0% in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022. No COVID-19 vaccine sales were recorded in the first quarter of 2023 while the previous year’s quarter included €3.8 million.IXIARO®/JESPECT® product sales were €17.4 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared to €4.2 million in the first quarter of 2022  an increase of 315.2% (314.5% at CER) with sales benefitting from the continuing recovery of travel markets and price increases. DUKORAL® sales were €10.2 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared to €2.5 million in the first quarter of 2022  an increase of 302.6% (317.3% at CER)  also benefitting from the significant recovery in the private travel markets and price increases. Third Party product sales declined to €4.5 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared to €5.6 million in the first quarter of 2022  a decrease of 19.7%  which was mainly driven by supply constraints of products sold under the distribution agreement with Bavarian Nordic for the sales of Rabipur®/RabAvert® and Encepur®.Other revenues  including revenues from collaborations  licensing and services amounted to €1.4 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared to €5.7 million in the first quarter of 2022. The decline mainly resulted from declining customer services in the Clinical Trial Material (CTM) unit in Sweden and no further revenues recognized from the Pfizer Lyme VLA15 collaboration agreement.Operating Result and adjusted EBITDACosts of goods and services sold (COGS) were €20.5 million in the first quarter of 2023. The gross margin on commercial product sales excluding COVID-19 sales was 48.4% compared to 68.5% in the first quarter of 2022. COGS of €7.2 million related to IXIARO® product sales yielded a product gross margin of 58.7%. COGS of €6.3 million related to DUKORAL® product sales yielded a product gross margin of 38.3%. Of the remaining COGS for the first quarter of 2023  €3.1 million were related to the Third-Party product distribution business. In the first quarter of 2022  overall COGS were €14.7 million  of which €9.6 million related to cost of goods and €5.1 million related to cost of services.Research and development expenses amounted to €14.1 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared to €20.7 million in the first quarter of 2022. This decrease was mainly driven by lower spend on Valneva’s COVID-19 vaccine VLA2001. Marketing and distribution expenses in the first quarter of 2023 amounted to €9.0 million compared to €2.0 million in the first quarter of 2022. Marketing and distribution expenses in the first quarter of 2023 notably included €3.4 million of expenses related to the launch preparation costs of the chikungunya vaccine candidate  VLA1553  compared to €1.2 million in the first quarter of 2022. In the first quarter of 2023  general and administrative expenses increased to €10.0 million from €5.8 million in the first quarter of 2022. COGS  research and development  marketing and distribution as well as general and administrative expenses benefited in the first quarter of 2022 from an accrual adjustment income of €11.7 million related to the favorable effect of the Company’s share price development on the employee share-based compensation programs.Other income  net of other expenses  increased to €3.5 million in the first quarter of 2023 from €2.1 million in the first quarter of 2022. This increase was mainly driven by recognizing grant income received from Scottish Enterprise into the income statement in the first quarter of 2023.Valneva recorded an operating loss of €16.6 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared to an operating loss of €18.4 million in the first quarter of 2022.

This was mainly a result of a foreign exchange gain amounting to €3.2 million in the first quarter of 2023  primarily driven by revaluation results of non-Euro denominated balance sheet positions  compared to a net foreign exchange loss of €2.4 million in the first quarter of 2022.

While non-IFRS measures should not be construed as alternatives to IFRS measures  management believes non-IFRS measures are useful to further understand Valneva’s current performance  performance trends  and financial condition.Adjusted EBITDA is a common supplemental measure of performance used by investors and financial analysts. Management believes this measure provide additional analytical tools. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings (loss) from continuing operations before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization.A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to operating loss  which is the most directly comparable IFRS measure  is set forth below:€ in million 3 months ending March 31 (unaudited results  consolidated per IFRS) 2023 2022 Net Income (18.1) (26.0) Add: Income tax expense (0.1) 0.5 Total Finance income (0.3) (0.0) Total Finance expense 5.1 4.7 Foreign exchange gain/(loss) – net (3.2) 2.4 Result from investments in associates - - Amortization 1.6 1.6 Depreciation 2.6 3.6 Impairment of Tangible Assets - - Adjusted EBITDA (12.3) (13.3)About Valneva SEWe are a specialty vaccine company focused on the development  manufacturing and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases.

YoY).

A further devaluation of the Pakistani Rupee in the quarter resulting in 47% YoY depreciation negatively impacted the financial performance in reported currency. Jazz grew its 4G users (+17.4% YoY) and ARPU (+16.9% YoY) in 1Q23. EBITDA rose by 12.0% YoY in local currency (-23.2% YoY in reported currency).

Although our Russian operations are now classified as ‘held for sale’ and ‘discontinued operations’ and do not contribute to our comparison base or actual reported numbers in this release (except as specifically stated)  our operations in Ukraine continue to be affected by the conflict. We hope that there will be a peaceful and amicable resolution and are doing everything we can to protect the safety of our employees  while continuing to ensure the uninterrupted operation of our communications  financial and digital services.The comprehensive sanctions on investment and vendors in Russia and the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine have had a significant impact on the Company’s operations and business plans in Russia and Ukraine and may continue to have a significant impact on the Company’s operations and business plans in Ukraine.

However  we may need to record future impairment charges  which could be significant if the conflict continues or escalates and as more information becomes available to management.

Pakistan revenues rose 16.0% YoY in local currency (-20.4% YoY in reported currency)  a strong result given the challenging macroeconomic environment. A further devaluation of the Pakistani Rupee in the quarter resulting in 47% YoY depreciation negatively impacted the financial performance in reported currency. Jazz grew its 4G users (+17.4% YoY) and ARPU (+16.9% YoY) in 1Q23. EBITDA rose by 12.0% YoY in local currency (-23.2% YoY in reported currency). Higher energy and fuel prices in Pakistan negatively impacted the EBITDA margin of 45.2% by c.3 p.p. In Kazakhstan  revenues increased 23.3% YoY in local currency (+23.4% YoY in reported currency)  marking the eighth consecutive quarter of revenue growth above 20%. This was driven by the further expansion of our mobile customer base (+4.6% YoY)  higher data usage (+25.1% YoY) and inflationary pricing. Beeline Kazakhstan reached 68.7% 4G penetration (+2.3 p.p. YoY). EBITDA rose by 37.9% YoY in local currency terms (+39.3% YoY in reported currency). In 1Q22  EBITDA was impacted by a KZT 2.0 billion one-off extraordinary charitable donation. Adjusting for this  Beeline Kazakhstan’s EBITDA grew by 29.4% YoY in local currency. In Bangladesh  Banglalink’s revenues increased 17.7% YoY in local currency (-4.2% YoY in reported currency) supported by strong growth in data revenue  which was up 35.0% YoY. This was the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit local currency revenue growth. Banglalink’s nation-wide network expansion supported robust 39.1% YoY growth in 4G users. Banglalink delivered balanced growth with its subscriber base  which was up +7.7% YoY  and ARPU  which grew +9.9% YoY. EBITDA increased 11.7% YoY in local currency (-9.0% YoY in reported currency). In Uzbekistan  revenues increased 24.0% YoY in local currency (+19.9% YoY in reported currency)  a fifth consecutive quarter of revenue growth above 20%. This was driven by a 21.6% YoY expansion of the 4G subscriber base and a robust increase in data revenues  which were 25.5% higher YoY in local currency. EBITDA rose 9.7% YoY in local currency (+6.1% YoY in reported currency). We have seen a strong start to the second quarter and in April local currency revenues are up 20.1% YoY with EBITDA up 25.8% YoY. As we executed on our strategy across the Group  our 2023 local currency guidance for both revenue and EBITDA growth remains at 10%-14%. VEON’s 2023 outlook for the Group’s capex intensity is in the range of 18%-20%. Key recent developments OFAC licence .

As such  you should not place undue reliance on this information. This information may not be indicative of the actual results for any future period. The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the sanctions imposed by the United States  member states of the European Union  the European Union itself  the United Kingdom  Ukraine and certain other nations  counter-sanctions by Russia and other legal and regulatory responses  as well as responses by our service providers  partners  suppliers and other counterparties  and the consequences of all of the foregoing have impacted and  if the conflict  sanctions and such responses continue or escalate  may significantly impact our results and aspects of our operations in Russia and Ukraine  and may significantly affect our results and aspects of our operations in the other countries in which we operate. We are closely monitoring events in Russia and Ukraine  as well as the possibility of the imposition of further sanctions in connection with the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and any resulting further rise in tensions between Russia and the United States  the United Kingdom and/or the European Union. Although our Russian operations are now classified as ‘held for sale’ and ‘discontinued operations’ and do not contribute to our comparison base or actual reported numbers in this release (except as specifically stated)  our operations in Ukraine continue to be affected by the conflict. We hope that there will be a peaceful and amicable resolution and are doing everything we can to protect the safety of our employees  while continuing to ensure the uninterrupted operation of our communications  financial and digital services. The comprehensive sanctions on investment and vendors in Russia and the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine have had a significant impact on the Company’s operations and business plans in Russia and Ukraine and may continue to have a significant impact on the Company’s operations and business plans in Ukraine. During the three months ended 31 March 2023  we have not recorded any impairment charges related to the Russian operations and have not recorded significant impairment charges related to the Ukrainian operations. However  we may need to record future impairment charges  which could be significant if the conflict continues or escalates and as more information becomes available to management. It is possible further impairment charges may rise to such a level on an accounting basis as to require additional analysis of true asset values in order to determine the true value of assets to be compared to liabilities as outlined in the provisions of our debt agreements. Due to the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the consequences as mentioned above  the Company requires additional time to complete all necessary disclosures in its Annual Report on Form 20-F to be filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“U.S. SEC”) as well as its Dutch financial statements to be filed with the Autoriteit Financiële Markten (“AFM”)  including completing its preparation of VEON’s consolidated financial statements and subsequently receiving the related audit report on the financial statements and internal control over financial reporting from its independent registered public accounting firm.

The patent  entitled Diagnostic method for detecting the pathological correlates of chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGvHD) using particular cytokine or chemokine biomarkers  has been submitted at the European Patent Office desk (EPO). This patent covers the use of a new quantitative method to evaluate the impact of medications destined at changing the course of the chronic form of the Graft versus Host Disease (cGvHD).In 2021  BioSenic successfully concluded a prospective national multicenter single-arm open-label Phase II study in 5 university hospital centers in France. In the trial  BioSenic treated 21 cGvHD patients with an intravenous formulation  known as Arscimed  of arsenic trioxide (ATO). BioSenic published positive safety and efficacy results in the international peer-reviewed journal Transplantation and Cellular Therapy. Subsequent analysis of patient serums now provides key data on the transition of cytokines/chemokines concentrations from an initial abnormal range of values to a normalized level  associated with reduced disease activity. Data of the post-hoc study are now available. These biomarkers will potentially help estimate the risk of developing the disease at early stages with measured levels of selected cytokines  and also to assess the therapeutic response to current standard of care or any new treatment.“BioSenic's newly submitted patent will allow the company to accelerate the development and approval of its novel therapeutic agents in cGvHD. This patent covers quantitative research tools that are needed to evaluate short-term responses to treatments and to predict long-term clinical benefits ” said Prof. François Rieger  PhD  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of BioSenic. “Regulatory agencies will be far more receptive to market approvals for treatment use of any active pharmacological ingredient if the means of quantitative monitoring of the assessment of the activity and direct staging of the disease are applicable. This patent adds to our extensive patent portfolio covering both of our therapeutic platforms. It will also be invaluable in our Phase 3 clinical trial using an oral formulation of ATO that is on target to start this year. Using this new disclosed quantitative method for the evaluation of disease activity will be a strong advantage to firmly establish the validity of any new experimental treatment.”BioSenic’s technology covered by the patent applies to a method and kit for diagnosing and monitoring cGvHD in an individual who has undergone an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The patent describes biomarkers to be used to determine if the condition of a patient worsens or improves following standard or new treatments for cGvHD. This quantitative set of evaluations consists of determining the kinetics levels of selected  meaningful cytokines in an individual's blood sample. Such quantitative assessments of cGvHD can further guide clinical decisions and can help to analyze the outcome of endpoints in clinical trials. This industrial biomarker kit could generate a global turnover of 30 to 40 million euros as more than 15 000 patients are treated for cGvHD each year.About BioSenicBioSenic is a leading biotech company specializing in the development of clinical assets issued from: (i)  the allogeneic cell therapy platform ALLOB and (ii) the Arsenic TriOxide (ATO) platform. Key target indications for the platforms include Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD)  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) and high-risk tibial fractures.Following the merger in October 2022  BioSenic combines the strategic positionings and strengths of Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics. The merger also enables Biosenic to add to its innovative cell therapy platform and strong IP for tissue repair protection with an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/OATO.BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About BioSenic technology platformsBioSenic’s technology is based on two main platforms:1) The allogeneic cell and gene therapy platform  developed by BioSenic with differentiated bone marrow sourced Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) that can be stored at the point of use in hospitals. Its current investigational medicinal product  ALLOB  represents a unique  proprietary approach to organ repair and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells on the site of injury after a single local injection. These cells are produced via a BioSenic's scalable manufacturing process. Following the CTA approval by regulatory authorities in Europe  BioSenic has initiated patient recruitment for the Phase IIb clinical trial with ALLOB in patients with difficult tibial fractures  using its optimized production process. ALLOB is currently being evaluated in a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase IIb study in patients with high-risk tibial fractures  using its optimized production process  after a successful first safety and efficacy study (Phase 1/2a) on fractured long bones  with late delayed union. The patient recruitment has been halted late February 2023 with 57 patients and the new rules permitted for statistical analysis should allow BioSenic to get the main results of this trial much earlier than anticipated in the original protocol  since they are expected by mid-2023.2) The Arsenic TriOxide (ATO) platform developed by Medsenic. The immunomodulatory properties of ATO have demonstrated a double basic effect on cells of the immune system. The first effect is the increase of the cell oxidative stress in activated B  T or other cells of the innate/adaptative immune system to the point they will enter a cell death program (apoptosis) and be eliminated. The second effect is potent immunomodulatory properties on several pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in inflammatory or autoimmune cell pathways. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. GvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). GvHD is primarily mediated by the transplanted immune system that can lead to severe multiorgan damage. Medsenic had been successful in a Phase II trial with its intravenous formulation  allowing arsenic trioxide to be granted an orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA and is heading towards an international Phase III confirmatory study  with a new  IP protected  oral (OATO) formulation. Moderate to Severe forms of Systemic Lupus erythematosus (SLE) is another selected target  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastro-intestinal tract) in a Phase IIa study.Systemic Sclerosis is  in addition  part of the clinical pipeline of BioSenic. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive. This gives good grounds to launch a Phase II clinical protocol for this serious disease that badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and with no actual current effective treatment.In addition  BioSenic is developing an off-the-shelf next-generation improved viscosupplement  JTA-004  consisting of a unique combination of plasma proteins  hyaluronic acid - a natural component of knee synovial fluid  and a fast-acting analgesic. JTA-004 intends to provide added lubrication and protection to the cartilage of the arthritic joint and to alleviate osteoarthritic pain (OA) and inflammation. In March 2023  after the identification of new OA subtypes  BioSenic delivered a new post-hoc analysis of its Phase III JTA-004 trial on knee OA with positive action on the most severely affected patient population. This new post-hoc analysis changes the therapeutic profile of the molecule and potentially allows for the possibility of stratifying patients for a new  optimized Phase III clinical study. BioSenic  which does not intend to allocate R&D resources to support the clinical development of JTA-004 and will continue to focus its R&D activities on the development of its autoimmune (ATO) and cell therapy (ALLOB) platforms  is now seeking to collaborate with existing and potential partners to explore options for the future development of JTA-004 based on this new post-hoc analysis.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAPr.

In this announcement “Shell”  “Shell Group” and “Group” are sometimes used for convenience where references are made to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general. Likewise  the words “we”  “us” and our” are also used to refer to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general or to those who work for them. These terms are also used where no useful purpose is served by identifying the particular entity or entities. ‘‘Subsidiaries’’  “Shell subsidiaries” and “Shell companies” as used in this announcement refer to entities over which Shell plc either directly or indirectly has control. Entities and unincorporated arrangements over which Shell has joint control are generally referred to as “joint ventures” and “joint operations”  respectively. “Joint ventures” and “joint operations” are collectively referred to as “joint arrangements”. Entities over which Shell has significant influence but neither control nor joint control are referred to as “associates”. The term “Shell interest” is used for convenience to indicate the direct and/or indirect ownership interest held by Shell in an entity or unincorporated joint arrangement  after exclusion of all third-party interest.Forward-Looking StatementsThis announcement contains forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) concerning the financial condition  results of operations and businesses of Shell. All statements other than statements of historical fact are  or may be deemed to be  forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management’s current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking statements include  among other things  statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management’s expectations  beliefs  estimates  forecasts  projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as “aim”  “ambition”  ‘anticipate’’  ‘‘believe’’  ‘‘could’’  ‘‘estimate’’  ‘‘expect’’  ‘‘goals’’  ‘‘intend’’  ‘‘may’’  “milestones”  ‘‘objectives’’  ‘‘outlook’’  ‘‘plan’’  ‘‘probably’’  ‘‘project’’  ‘‘risks’’  “schedule”  ‘‘seek’’  ‘‘should’’  ‘‘target’’  ‘‘will’’ and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this announcement  including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell’s products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets  and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative  judicial  fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks  including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities  delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics  such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak; and (n) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this announcement are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc’s Form 20-F for the year ended December 31  2022 (available at www.shell.com/investor and www.sec.gov ). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this announcement and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement  May 4  2023. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information  future events or other information. In light of these risks  results could differ materially from those stated  implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this announcement.Shell’s net carbon intensityAlso  in this announcement we may refer to Shell’s “Net Carbon Intensity”  which includes Shell’s carbon emissions from the production of our energy products  our suppliers’ carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers’ carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the term Shell’s “Net Carbon Intensity” is for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.Shell’s net-Zero Emissions TargetShell’s operating plan  outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly  they reflect our Scope 1  Scope 2 and Net Carbon Intensity (NCI) targets over the next ten years. However  Shell’s operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target and 2035 NCI target  as these targets are currently outside our planning period. In the future  as society moves towards net-zero emissions  we expect Shell’s operating plans to reflect this movement. However  if society is not net zero in 2050  as of today  there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.Forward Looking Non-GAAP measuresThis announcement may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as cash capital expenditure and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell  such as oil and gas prices  interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover  estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc’s consolidated financial statements.The contents of websites referred to in this announcement do not form part of this announcement.We may have used certain terms  such as resources  in this announcement that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC.

The patent  entitled Diagnostic method for detecting the pathological correlates of chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGvHD) using particular cytokine or chemokine biomarkers  has been submitted at the European Patent Office desk (EPO). This patent covers the use of a new quantitative method to evaluate the impact of medications destined at changing the course of the chronic form of the Graft versus Host Disease (cGvHD).In 2021  BioSenic successfully concluded a prospective national multicenter single-arm open-label Phase II study in 5 university hospital centers in France. In the trial  BioSenic treated 21 cGvHD patients with an intravenous formulation  known as Arscimed  of arsenic trioxide (ATO). BioSenic published positive safety and efficacy results in the international peer-reviewed journal Transplantation and Cellular Therapy. Subsequent analysis of patient serums now provides key data on the transition of cytokines/chemokines concentrations from an initial abnormal range of values to a normalized level  associated with reduced disease activity. Data of the post-hoc study are now available. These biomarkers will potentially help estimate the risk of developing the disease at early stages with measured levels of selected cytokines  and also to assess the therapeutic response to current standard of care or any new treatment.“BioSenic's newly submitted patent will allow the company to accelerate the development and approval of its novel therapeutic agents in cGvHD. This patent covers quantitative research tools that are needed to evaluate short-term responses to treatments and to predict long-term clinical benefits ” said Prof. François Rieger  PhD  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of BioSenic. “Regulatory agencies will be far more receptive to market approvals for treatment use of any active pharmacological ingredient if the means of quantitative monitoring of the assessment of the activity and direct staging of the disease are applicable. This patent adds to our extensive patent portfolio covering both of our therapeutic platforms. It will also be invaluable in our Phase 3 clinical trial using an oral formulation of ATO that is on target to start this year. Using this new disclosed quantitative method for the evaluation of disease activity will be a strong advantage to firmly establish the validity of any new experimental treatment.”BioSenic’s technology covered by the patent applies to a method and kit for diagnosing and monitoring cGvHD in an individual who has undergone an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The patent describes biomarkers to be used to determine if the condition of a patient worsens or improves following standard or new treatments for cGvHD. This quantitative set of evaluations consists of determining the kinetics levels of selected  meaningful cytokines in an individual's blood sample. Such quantitative assessments of cGvHD can further guide clinical decisions and can help to analyze the outcome of endpoints in clinical trials. This industrial biomarker kit could generate a global turnover of 30 to 40 million euros as more than 15 000 patients are treated for cGvHD each year.About BioSenicBioSenic is a leading biotech company specializing in the development of clinical assets issued from: (i)  the allogeneic cell therapy platform ALLOB and (ii) the Arsenic TriOxide (ATO) platform. Key target indications for the platforms include Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD)  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) and high-risk tibial fractures.Following the merger in October 2022  BioSenic combines the strategic positionings and strengths of Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics. The merger also enables Biosenic to add to its innovative cell therapy platform and strong IP for tissue repair protection with an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/OATO.BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About BioSenic technology platformsBioSenic’s technology is based on two main platforms:1) The allogeneic cell and gene therapy platform  developed by BioSenic with differentiated bone marrow sourced Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) that can be stored at the point of use in hospitals. Its current investigational medicinal product  ALLOB  represents a unique  proprietary approach to organ repair and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells on the site of injury after a single local injection. These cells are produced via a BioSenic's scalable manufacturing process. Following the CTA approval by regulatory authorities in Europe  BioSenic has initiated patient recruitment for the Phase IIb clinical trial with ALLOB in patients with difficult tibial fractures  using its optimized production process. ALLOB is currently being evaluated in a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase IIb study in patients with high-risk tibial fractures  using its optimized production process  after a successful first safety and efficacy study (Phase 1/2a) on fractured long bones  with late delayed union. The patient recruitment has been halted late February 2023 with 57 patients and the new rules permitted for statistical analysis should allow BioSenic to get the main results of this trial much earlier than anticipated in the original protocol  since they are expected by mid-2023.2) The Arsenic TriOxide (ATO) platform developed by Medsenic. The immunomodulatory properties of ATO have demonstrated a double basic effect on cells of the immune system. The first effect is the increase of the cell oxidative stress in activated B  T or other cells of the innate/adaptative immune system to the point they will enter a cell death program (apoptosis) and be eliminated. The second effect is potent immunomodulatory properties on several pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in inflammatory or autoimmune cell pathways. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. GvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). GvHD is primarily mediated by the transplanted immune system that can lead to severe multiorgan damage. Medsenic had been successful in a Phase II trial with its intravenous formulation  allowing arsenic trioxide to be granted an orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA and is heading towards an international Phase III confirmatory study  with a new  IP protected  oral (OATO) formulation. Moderate to Severe forms of Systemic Lupus erythematosus (SLE) is another selected target  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastro-intestinal tract) in a Phase IIa study.Systemic Sclerosis is  in addition  part of the clinical pipeline of BioSenic. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive. This gives good grounds to launch a Phase II clinical protocol for this serious disease that badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and with no actual current effective treatment.In addition  BioSenic is developing an off-the-shelf next-generation improved viscosupplement  JTA-004  consisting of a unique combination of plasma proteins  hyaluronic acid - a natural component of knee synovial fluid  and a fast-acting analgesic. JTA-004 intends to provide added lubrication and protection to the cartilage of the arthritic joint and to alleviate osteoarthritic pain (OA) and inflammation. In March 2023  after the identification of new OA subtypes  BioSenic delivered a new post-hoc analysis of its Phase III JTA-004 trial on knee OA with positive action on the most severely affected patient population. This new post-hoc analysis changes the therapeutic profile of the molecule and potentially allows for the possibility of stratifying patients for a new  optimized Phase III clinical study. BioSenic  which does not intend to allocate R&D resources to support the clinical development of JTA-004 and will continue to focus its R&D activities on the development of its autoimmune (ATO) and cell therapy (ALLOB) platforms  is now seeking to collaborate with existing and potential partners to explore options for the future development of JTA-004 based on this new post-hoc analysis.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAPr.

The revenues in foreign currency over the given period are translated into the rate of exchange for the comparable period. The impact of business acquisitions (or gain of control) and divestments is restated as followsFor businesses acquired (or gain of control) during the current period  revenue generated since the acquisition date is excluded from the organic growth calculation;For businesses acquired (or gain of control) during the prior fiscal year  revenue generated during the current period up until the first anniversary date of the acquisition is excluded;For businesses divested (or loss of control) during the prior fiscal year  revenue generated in the comparative period of the prior fiscal year until the divestment date is excluded. In the specific case of the loss of control of the long life activities in North America  the IFRS 5 standard having been applied to the historical data  the revenue is already restated in the historical elements;For businesses divested (or loss of control) during the current fiscal year  revenue generated in the period commencing 12 months before the divestment date up to the end of the comparative period of the prior fiscal year is excluded.Alternative performance indicators : the group presents in its financial notices performance indicators not defined by accounting standards.

Organic growth (i.e. adjusted for Group scope and exchange rates) was +10.1%  a deceleration that was more limited than expected given the high comparison base.In an economic environment that remains challenging  this performance was mainly driven by the strength of the Group’s high added value service offerings in the areas of Intelligent Industry and Customer First.OPERATIONS BY REGIONMost of the Group’s regions continued to grow double-digits at constant exchange rates in Q1 2023.Revenues in the United Kingdom and Ireland region (12% of Group revenues in Q1 2023) increased +13.9% at constant exchange rates  driven by strong growth in the Manufacturing and Consumer Goods sectors and the solid performance of Financial Services and the Public Sector.Momentum also remained strong in the Rest of Europe (31% of Group revenues)  with growth of +13.8% at constant exchange rates  driven by double-digit growth in the sectors of Manufacturing  the Public Sector and Financial Services - as well as TMT (Telecoms  Media and Technology) and Energy & Utilities.Activity in France (20% of Group revenues) was dynamic  with growth of +12.4% at constant exchange rates  boosted by strong momentum in the Manufacturing  Financial Services  Consumer Goods and Public sectors.The North America region (29% of Group revenues) recorded comparatively moderate growth of +6.1% at constant exchange rates. While the Manufacturing and Services sectors were particularly dynamic  the Financial Services and Consumer Goods sectors trailed  with growth rates lagging behind other regions. The TMT sector experienced a slight contraction.Finally  revenues in the Asia-Pacific and Latin America region (8% of Group revenues) increased by +8.4% at constant exchange rates. In Asia-Pacific  the robust momentum - now essentially organic - was primarily fueled by the Financial Services  Manufacturing and Consumer Goods sectors.OPERATIONS BY BUSINESSAll Group business lines reported growth rates of close to or above 10% at constant exchange rates.Strategy & Transformation services (9% of Group revenues in Q1 2023) and Applications & Technology services (62% of Group revenues and Capgemini’s core business) posted growth in total revenues* at constant exchange rates of +15.6% and +10.7%  respectively. This strong momentum  albeit decelerating compared to 2022 as expected  reflects the priority given by Group clients to their strategic digital transformation projects.Operations & Engineering total revenues* (29% of Group revenues) grew +9.2% at constant exchange rates  with sustained activity levels across all the businesses.HEADCOUNTAt March 31  2023  the Group’s total headcount stood at 357 000  up +5% year-on-year. 207 300 employees work in offshore centers  or 58% of the total headcount  up +4%.BOOKINGSBookings totaled €5 867 million in Q1 2023  up +6.5% year-on-year at constant exchange rates against a particularly high comparison base  with +26% growth in Q1 2022. The book-to-bill ratio of 1.02 is above the average since 2017.OUTLOOKThe Group’s financial targets for 2023 are:Revenue growth of +4% to +7% at constant currency;Operating margin of 13.0% to 13.2%;Organic free cash flow of around €1.8 billion.The inorganic contribution to growth should be 0.5 points at the lower end of the target range and 1.0 point at the upper end.CONFERENCE CALLAiman Ezzat  Chief Executive Officer  accompanied by Carole Ferrand  Chief Financial Officer  and Olivier Sevillia  Chief Operating Officer  will present this press release during a conference call in English to be held today at 8.00 a.m. Paris time (CET).

The Group scope and exchange rates used are those for the reported period. Exchange rates for the reported period are also used to calculate growth at constant exchange rates.Reconciliation of growth rates Q1 2023 Organic growth +10.1% Changes in Group scope +0.6 pt Growth at constant exchange rates +10.7% Exchange rate fluctuations +0.2 pt Reported growth +10.9%When determining activity trends by business and in accordance with internal operating performance measures  growth at constant exchange rates is calculated based on total revenues  i.e.  before elimination of inter-business billing. The Group considers this to be more representative of activity levels by business. As its businesses change  an increasing number of contracts require a range of business expertise for delivery  leading to a rise in inter-business flows.Operating margin is one of the Group’s key performance indicators.

Revenues Change (in millions of euros) 2022 2023 Reported At constant exchange rates* Q1 5 167 5 729 +10.9% +10.7% Momentum remained robust in early 2023  with revenue growth of +10.7% at constant exchange rates* in Q1 2023. Organic growth (i.e. adjusted for Group scope and exchange rates) was +10.1%  a deceleration that was more limited than expected given the high comparison base. The terms and Alternative Performance Measures marked with an (*) are defined and/or reconciled in the appendix to this press release. Press Release 1In an economic environment that remains challenging  this performance was mainly driven by the strength of the Group's high added value service offerings in the areas of Intelligent Industry and Customer First. OPERATIONS BY REGION Most of the Group's regions continued to grow double-digits at constant exchange rates in Q1 2023. Revenues in the United Kingdom and Ireland region (12% of Group revenues in Q1 2023) increased +13.9% at constant exchange rates  driven by strong growth in the Manufacturing and Consumer Goods sectors and the solid performance of Financial Services and the Public Sector. Momentum also remained strong in the Rest of Europe (31% of Group revenues)  with growth of +13.8% at constant exchange rates  driven by double-digit growth in the sectors of Manufacturing  the Public Sector and Financial Services - as well as TMT (Telecoms  Media and Technology) and Energy & Utilities. Activity in France (20% of Group revenues) was dynamic  with growth of +12.4% at constant exchange rates  boosted by strong momentum in the Manufacturing  Financial Services  Consumer Goods and Public sectors. The North America region (29% of Group revenues) recorded comparatively moderate growth of +6.1% at constant exchange rates. While the Manufacturing and Services sectors were particularly dynamic  the Financial Services and Consumer Goods sectors trailed  with growth rates lagging behind other regions. The TMT sector experienced a slight contraction. Finally  revenues in the Asia-Pacificand Latin America region (8% of Group revenues) increased by +8.4% at constant exchange rates. In Asia-Pacific  the robust momentum - now essentially organic - was primarily fueled by the Financial Services  Manufacturing and Consumer Goods sectors. OPERATIONS BY BUSINESS All Group business lines reported growth rates of close to or above 10% at constant exchange rates. Strategy & Transformation services (9% of Group revenues in Q1 2023) and Applications & Technology services (62% of Group revenues and Capgemini's core business) posted growth in total revenues* at constant exchange rates of +15.6% and +10.7%  respectively. This strong momentum  albeit decelerating compared to 2022 as expected  reflects the priority given by Group clients to their strategic digital transformation projects. Operations & Engineering total revenues* (29% of Group revenues) grew +9.2% at constant exchange rates  with sustained activity levels across all the businesses. HEADCOUNT At March 31  2023  the Group's total headcount stood at 357 000  up +5% year-on-year. 207 300 employees work in offshore centers  or 58% of the total headcount  up +4%. BOOKINGS Bookings totaled €5 867 million in Q1 2023  up +6.5% year-on-year at constant exchange rates against a particularly high comparison base  with +26% growth in Q1 2022. The book-to-bill ratio of 1.02 is above the average since 2017. OUTLOOK The Group's financial targets for 2023 are: Revenue growth of +4% to +7% at constant currency;Operating margin of 13.0% to 13.2%;Organic free cash flow of around €1.8 billion. The inorganic contribution to growth should be 0.5 points at the lower end of the target range and 1.0 point at the upper end.

DEFINITIONS Organic growth or like-for-like growth in revenues is the growth rate calculated at constant Group scope and exchange rates. The Group scope and exchange rates used are those for the reported period. Exchange rates for the reported period are also used to calculate growth at constant exchange rates. Reconciliation of growth rates Q1 2023 Organic growth +10.1% Changes in Group scope +0.6 pt Growth at constant exchange rates +10.7% Exchange rate fluctuations +0.2 pt Reported growth +10.9% When determining activity trends by business and in accordance with internal operating performance measures  growth at constant exchange rates is calculated based on total revenues  i.e.  before elimination of inter- business billing. The Group considers this to be more representative of activity levels by business. As its businesses change  an increasing number of contracts require a range of business expertise for delivery  leading to a rise in inter-business flows. Operating margin is one of the Group's key performance indicators. It is defined as the difference between revenues and operating costs. It is calculated before ""Other operating income and expense"" which include amortization of intangible assets recognized in business combinations  the charge resulting from the deferred recognition of the fair value of shares granted to employees (including social security contributions and employer contributions)  and non-recurring revenues and expenses  notably impairment of goodwill  negative goodwill  capital gains or losses on disposals of consolidated companies or businesses  restructuring costs incurred under a detailed formal plan approved by the Group's Management  the cost of acquiring and integrating companies acquired by the Group  including earn-outs comprising conditions of presence  and the effects of curtailments  settlements and transfers of defined benefit pension plans; Normalized net profit is equal to profit for the year (Group share) adjusted for the impact of items recognized in ""Other operating income and expense""  net of tax calculated using the effective tax rate. Normalized earnings per share are computed like basic earnings per share  i.e. excluding dilution. Organic free cash flow is equal to cash flow from operations less acquisitions of property  plant  equipment and intangible assets (net of disposals) and repayments of lease liabilities  adjusted for cash out relating to the net interest cost. Net debt (or net cash and cash equivalents) comprises (i) cash and cash equivalents  as presented in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows (consisting of short-term investments and cash at bank) less bank overdrafts  (ii) cash management assets (assets presented separately in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position due to their characteristics)  less (iii) short- and long-term borrowings.

The drivers of the revenue decline  on a constant currency basis were the net impact of a price increase of 3.5%  a volume decline of 6.2% and the net impact of acquisitions and disposals delivering 0.3% growth. Glanbia Performance Nutrition (all commentary is on a constant currency basis) GPN delivered growth of 4.6% in the first three months of 2023. Revenue growth was driven by price growth of 14.1% and a volume decline of 9.5%. Branded like-for-like revenue for the period increased by 5.0%  driven by price growth of 14.2% and a volume decline of 9.2%. ON  the leading brand in the sports nutrition sector globally  which represents approximately 60% of the GPN portfolio  delivered volume growth in the period with the overall volume decline in GPN driven largely by the SlimFast brand. Pricing was positive across all brands and in all regions following pricing action taken in 2022. 2Americas GPN Americas delivered 2.2% revenue growth in the period. Price growth across all brands was offset by a volume decline largely driven by the SlimFast brand. The ON brand continues to sustain a strong consumer position and delivered US consumption growth in the 12 weeks to the end of February of 36.1%  underpinned by distribution gains and marketing activation. Trends in the healthy lifestyle portfolio remained robust  with US consumption growth in the 12 weeks to the end of February of 15.4% across the think!  Isopure and Amazing Grass brands. The SlimFast brand performance continues to be impacted by headwinds in the overall diet category with US consumption in the 12 weeks to the end of February down 27.0%. The brand refresh is in market as planned  supported by new branding and pack design  creative content and innovation. International GPN International delivered 10.3% revenue growth in the period. Pricing was positive across all regions due to the execution of the 2022 price increases. Volume trends in key regional markets remain resilient. Glanbia Nutritionals (all commentary is on a constant currency basis) GN revenue decreased by 5.3% in the period driven by a price decrease of 0.8%  a volume decrease of 5.0% and the net impact of acquisitions and disposals delivering 0.5% revenue growth. Nutritional Solutions GN NS revenue decreased by 14.8% in the period. Pricing increased by 1.0%  with positive pricing in the premix business offset by negative pricing in the proteins business driven by the decline in dairy market pricing. Volumes declined by 17.4% driven by customer supply chain rebalancing during the period. The Sterling Technology acquisition continues to perform well  with the net impact of the acquisition and disposals contributing 1.6% to revenue growth in the period. GN NS continues to support customers seeking to address growing consumer trends through its core strengths in premix solutions and extensive capability in protein solutions. Based on customer engagement  volume trends are expected to normalise as the year progresses and we expect a marginal volume decline in the full year relative to the prior year. US Cheese US Cheese revenue decreased by 1.3% in the period. This was driven by volume growth of 0.2% and a pricing decline of 1.5%  aligned with lower year-on-year market pricing.

This strong first quarter reinforces our confidence in our growth prospects for the year  which should now reach or exceed the mid-point of the targeted range."" Revenues Change (in millions of euros) 2022 2023 Reported At constant exchange rates* Q1 5 167 5 729 +10.9% +10.7% Momentum remained robust in early 2023  with revenue growth of +10.7% at constant exchange rates* in Q1 2023. Organic growth (i.e. adjusted for Group scope and exchange rates) was +10.1%  a deceleration that was more limited than expected given the high comparison base. The terms and Alternative Performance Measures marked with an (*) are defined and/or reconciled in the appendix to this press release. Press Release 1In an economic environment that remains challenging  this performance was mainly driven by the strength of the Group's high added value service offerings in the areas of Intelligent Industry and Customer First. OPERATIONS BY REGION Most of the Group's regions continued to grow double-digits at constant exchange rates in Q1 2023. Revenues in the United Kingdom and Ireland region (12% of Group revenues in Q1 2023) increased +13.9% at constant exchange rates  driven by strong growth in the Manufacturing and Consumer Goods sectors and the solid performance of Financial Services and the Public Sector. Momentum also remained strong in the Rest of Europe (31% of Group revenues)  with growth of +13.8% at constant exchange rates  driven by double-digit growth in the sectors of Manufacturing  the Public Sector and Financial Services - as well as TMT (Telecoms  Media and Technology) and Energy & Utilities. Activity in France (20% of Group revenues) was dynamic  with growth of +12.4% at constant exchange rates  boosted by strong momentum in the Manufacturing  Financial Services  Consumer Goods and Public sectors. The North America region (29% of Group revenues) recorded comparatively moderate growth of +6.1% at constant exchange rates. While the Manufacturing and Services sectors were particularly dynamic  the Financial Services and Consumer Goods sectors trailed  with growth rates lagging behind other regions. The TMT sector experienced a slight contraction. Finally  revenues in the Asia-Pacificand Latin America region (8% of Group revenues) increased by +8.4% at constant exchange rates. In Asia-Pacific  the robust momentum - now essentially organic - was primarily fueled by the Financial Services  Manufacturing and Consumer Goods sectors. OPERATIONS BY BUSINESS All Group business lines reported growth rates of close to or above 10% at constant exchange rates. Strategy & Transformation services (9% of Group revenues in Q1 2023) and Applications & Technology services (62% of Group revenues and Capgemini's core business) posted growth in total revenues* at constant exchange rates of +15.6% and +10.7%  respectively. This strong momentum  albeit decelerating compared to 2022 as expected  reflects the priority given by Group clients to their strategic digital transformation projects. Operations & Engineering total revenues* (29% of Group revenues) grew +9.2% at constant exchange rates  with sustained activity levels across all the businesses. HEADCOUNT At March 31  2023  the Group's total headcount stood at 357 000  up +5% year-on-year. 207 300 employees work in offshore centers  or 58% of the total headcount  up +4%. BOOKINGS Bookings totaled €5 867 million in Q1 2023  up +6.5% year-on-year at constant exchange rates against a particularly high comparison base  with +26% growth in Q1 2022. The book-to-bill ratio of 1.02 is above the average since 2017. OUTLOOK The Group's financial targets for 2023 are: Revenue growth of +4% to +7% at constant currency;Operating margin of 13.0% to 13.2%;Organic free cash flow of around €1.8 billion. The inorganic contribution to growth should be 0.5 points at the lower end of the target range and 1.0 point at the upper end.

DEFINITIONS Organic growth or like-for-like growth in revenues is the growth rate calculated at constant Group scope and exchange rates. The Group scope and exchange rates used are those for the reported period. Exchange rates for the reported period are also used to calculate growth at constant exchange rates. Reconciliation of growth rates Q1 2023 Organic growth +10.1% Changes in Group scope +0.6 pt Growth at constant exchange rates +10.7% Exchange rate fluctuations +0.2 pt Reported growth +10.9% When determining activity trends by business and in accordance with internal operating performance measures  growth at constant exchange rates is calculated based on total revenues  i.e.  before elimination of inter- business billing. The Group considers this to be more representative of activity levels by business. As its businesses change  an increasing number of contracts require a range of business expertise for delivery  leading to a rise in inter-business flows. Operating margin is one of the Group's key performance indicators. It is defined as the difference between revenues and operating costs. It is calculated before ""Other operating income and expense"" which include amortization of intangible assets recognized in business combinations  the charge resulting from the deferred recognition of the fair value of shares granted to employees (including social security contributions and employer contributions)  and non-recurring revenues and expenses  notably impairment of goodwill  negative goodwill  capital gains or losses on disposals of consolidated companies or businesses  restructuring costs incurred under a detailed formal plan approved by the Group's Management  the cost of acquiring and integrating companies acquired by the Group  including earn-outs comprising conditions of presence  and the effects of curtailments  settlements and transfers of defined benefit pension plans; Normalized net profit is equal to profit for the year (Group share) adjusted for the impact of items recognized in ""Other operating income and expense""  net of tax calculated using the effective tax rate. Normalized earnings per share are computed like basic earnings per share  i.e. excluding dilution. Organic free cash flow is equal to cash flow from operations less acquisitions of property  plant  equipment and intangible assets (net of disposals) and repayments of lease liabilities  adjusted for cash out relating to the net interest cost. Net debt (or net cash and cash equivalents) comprises (i) cash and cash equivalents  as presented in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows (consisting of short-term investments and cash at bank) less bank overdrafts  (ii) cash management assets (assets presented separately in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position due to their characteristics)  less (iii) short- and long-term borrowings. Account is also taken of (iv) the impact of hedging instruments when these relate to borrowings  inter-company loans and own shares. 1 Note that in the appendix  certain totals may not equal the sum of amounts due to rounding adjustments.

Operating EBITA margin increased to 9.8% (last year: 9.4%).Peter Oosterveer  CEO Arcadis  comments:“During the last quarter  we have continued to see strong client demand for our services. Our Resilience business demonstrated strong results across the solutions portfolio. Our Places business has reaped the benefits of our diversification towards industrial manufacturing  intelligent buildings  and retrofitting  resulting in a more balanced backlog and solid pipeline. Our Mobility business increasingly supports clients with electrification and decarbonization of infrastructure assets. And strong demand for smart mobility solutions drives growth in our recently established Intelligence business.We are pleased to report that the integration of both Arcadis IBI and Arcadis DPS is progressing well. Our combined capabilities created significant wins in industrial manufacturing  pharmaceutical  semiconductor  and energy transition  and we are building a strong pipeline of additional synergy opportunities  whilst the expected cost synergies are materializing simultaneously.Our strong client relationships  diverse business offering and continued solid markets provide us with the opportunity to be more selective in the projects we pursue on  creating a resilient and balanced portfolio with sustained focus on profitable growth. The strong demand for our services originates from governments  public agencies as well as the private sector  despite the ongoing geopolitical turbulence and economic uncertainties.It has been both an honor and a privilege to lead Arcadis over the past six years. We significantly strengthened our focus on people  prioritized client relationships  while improving discipline around project selection and delivery. Sustainability has always been a cornerstone of the organization and we built on this foundation with a Sustainability Strategy and a Net Zero commitment  while addressing the growing client demand for sustainability solutions. We have transformed our operating model  complemented our capabilities through the acquisitions of last year  whilst divesting non-core areas. Capitalizing on its talented diverse teams  Arcadis  under the leadership of my nominated successor Alan Brookes  is well positioned to retain and attract talent  bring groundbreaking solutions and services to our clients  deliver profitable growth  and deliver on its strategic objectives.”KEY FIGURESAs the acquisitions of the IBI Group formally closed on 27th of September 2022  and DPS Group on 1st of December 2022  the Arcadis consolidated financial statements 2023 include IBI and DPS consolidated data.in € millions First quarter Period ended 31 March 2023 2023 2022 change Gross revenues 1 218 879 39% Net revenues 940 688 37% Organic growth1) 12.3% 5.6% Operating EBITDA2) 120 86 40% Operating EBITDA margin 12.8% 12.5% EBITA 87 65 33% EBITA margin 9.2% 9.5% Operating EBITA2) 92 64 43% Operating EBITA margin (%) 9.8% 9.4% Free Cash Flow (excl. lease liabilities)3) -108 -51 114% Net Working Capital % 12.9% 12.9% Days Sales Outstanding (days) 70 70 Net Debt 1 072 205 422% Order intake (millions) 1 062 785 35% Net revenues in backlog (millions) 3 192 2 349 36% Backlog organic growth (qtd)1) 3.9% 4.4%1) This excludes the impact of currency movements  acquisitions  divestments  and footprint reductions (such as the Middle East)2) Excluding acquisition  restructuring and non-operating integration-related costs3) Free Cash flow: Cash Flow from Operations corrected for Capex and Lease liabilitiesINCOME STATEMENTNet revenues totaled €940 million and increased organically by 12.3%. Growth was driven by all the GBAs  with exceptionally strong performance in North America. The currency impact was 0.5%. The operating EBITA margin improved to 9.8% (Q1’22: 9.4%).ORDER INTAKE & BACKLOGBacklog at the end of the quarter stood at €3 192 million (Q1’22: €2 349 million)  with strong business momentum leading to an order intake of €1 062 million (up 35% year on year) for the quarter. Organic backlog growth was 3.9% quarter-to-date  with a positive contribution of all GBAs and with very few project cancellations.BALANCE SHEET & CASH FLOWDays Sales Outstanding (DSO) stood at 70 days (Q1'22: 70 days) and net working capital as a percentage of annualized gross revenues at 12.9% (Q1'22: 12.9%)  in line with last year’s performance.The negative free cash flow generation during the quarter of €108 million reflects a year-on-year increase in line with our usual seasonal networking capital pattern applied to a significantly larger business volume and investments in net working capital from the very strong revenue growth.Net debt increased slightly to €1 072 million  with deleveraging on track. The bridge loan of €750 million was partly refinanced by a successful €500 million inaugural Eurobond issuance. The senior unsecured fixed rate notes have an annual coupon of 4.875%  are due 2028  and an investment grade rating of BBB- from Standard & Poor’s.INTEGRATION OF ARCADIS IBI AND ARCADIS DPSThe integration of Arcadis IBI and Arcadis DPS is on track with revenue and cost synergies materializing. The Architecture and Urbanism business unit is up and running as part of the Places GBA and sees strong momentum as it launches its first commercial events. The Intelligence GBA management team is set up and works closely with the Integration team to set a fit-for-purpose organization  consolidating the various organizations  and fostering innovation. Finally  Arcadis DPS is progressively embedded in the Places GBA  creating additional strengths in the industrial manufacturing area. Various revenue synergy opportunities were converted into order intake during the quarter  and we are progressing as planned on extracting the expected cost synergies.PERFORMANCE BY GLOBAL BUSINESS AREASRESILIENCE(35% of net revenues) in € millions First quarter Period ended 31 March 2023 2023 2022 change Net revenues 332 281 18% Organic growth1) 13.0% 6.9% Order intake (millions) 423 338 25% Net revenues in backlog (millions) 980 850 15% Backlog organic growth (qtd)1) 10.0% 7.2%1) This excludes the impact of currency movements  acquisitions  divestments  and footprint reductions (such as the Middle East)Solid revenue and backlog growth in the quarter was driven by all regions. We continue to see strong client demand in environmental restoration  with our leading position in PFAS. Clients increasingly look for our support in adopting renewable energy  in order to meet their Net-Zero ambitions. Clients’ demand continues to be strong for our enviro-social permitting solutions to deal with the issues in delivering their capital programs due to higher energy costs and sticky processes. Collaboration with Arcadis IBI results in cross selling to their client base. Strong market demands force us to set the right priorities.PLACES(41% of net revenues) in € millions First quarter Period ended 31 March 2023 2023 2022 change Net revenues 388 228 70% Organic growth1) 8.7% 1.1% Order intake (millions) 407 259 57% Net revenues in backlog (millions) 1 555 976 59% Backlog organic growth (qtd)1) 1.3% 3.3%1) This excludes the impact of currency movements  acquisitions  divestments  and footprint reductions (such as the Middle East)Revenue growth in the quarter was driven by a strong performance in North America and Europe  being key markets after the strategic repositioning last year.

In baby care revenue grew 10% like for like compared to last year  driven by continued volume growth of baby pants. In adult care revenue growth was 22% like for like  and also up quarter on quarter based on solid demand  both in healthcare and in retail channels. Feminine care revenue grew 16% like for like. Including favorable forex  total revenue growth was up 16% year on year  and 3% lower compared to the fourth quarter of 2022  reflecting more pronounced seasonality.Volume and mix changes had no significant net impact. In Europe the product mix improved  including higher growth of baby pants and adult care. Volumes were stable  compared to the first quarter of 2022 which was boosted by price-driven forward-buying of customers. Market demand continues to be supportive for retail brands  gaining market share in an overall flat market. Ontex volumes in North America reduced in the quarter  due to more pronounced destocking at certain lifestyle customers  also affecting the product mix.Prices were up 15% on average versus last year  with double digit price increases in all categories and major regions. Following the huge increase in raw material and other input costs  Ontex steadily rolled out price increases over the course of 2022 to mitigate the impact. While the majority of the pricing in this quarter is the effect of this  Ontex continued to execute additional pricing to recover cumulative cost inflation.Forex fluctuations had slight positive impact of 1%. The year-on-year appreciation of the Russian ruble and US dollar more than offset the depreciation of the British pound.Adjusted EBITDA of Core Markets (continuing operations)Adjusted EBITDA of Core Markets was €41 million  up 95% year on year. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 it was largely stable  offsetting continued sequential cost inflation with pricing and productivity gains. Adjusted EBITDA margin rose to 9.1%  by 3.7pp year on year and 0.4pp quarter on quarter.While there was no volume and mix effect on revenue  the improvement of the product mix  including in adult care and baby pants  had a €5 million positive impact on the EBITDA.Operating cost reduction measures represented €16 million in savings  a reduction of the operational cost base by close to 5%. Procurement initiatives and operational efficiency were the main drivers behind the improvement. While slightly up in line with inflation  mostly on wages  SG&A costs over sales were kept below 10%.Cost inflation weighed heavily on the year-on-year comparison  with a negative impact of €38 million from raw materials  especially on fluff and super-absorbent-polymers  and €17 million from other operating costs  including wage inflation. While the year-on-year increase is slowing versus the peak in the third quarter of 2022  it still marks a significant increase compared to the fourth quarter of last year  following the contract renewals at the start of the year. The total cost base went up by close to 20% versus the first quarter of 2022.The strong continued pricing contributed €58 million year on year. While this offset the additional input cost inflation versus the previous year for the first time overall  it does not cover the cumulative cost increase incurred since the start of the inflation wave in 2021 in all markets and categories. Thereby continued adjustments including selective pricing is required.Forex fluctuations had a €2 million net negative impact as the positive impact on revenue was more than offset by the year-on-year US dollar appreciation effect on input costs.Total Group (including discontinued operations)Discontinued operations  consisting of the Emerging Markets division  generated a revenue of €206 million  up 17% like for like compared with last year  driven mostly by pricing across regions. Lower volumes in Mexico and the Middle East were offset by volume growth in Brazil and a general mix improvement. Overall revenue growth was 22% year on year  thanks to positive forex fluctuations  with the appreciation of the Mexican peso and Brazilian real more than offsetting the depreciation and hyperinflation impact of the Turkish lira. Adjusted EBITDA came in at €15 million  versus €4 million in 2022  and marking a further increase of 37% versus the fourth quarter of last year. The adjusted EBITDA margin of 7.3%  is up 5.1pp year on year and 2.2pp quarter on quarter.Total Group revenue was €652 million  up 16% like for like versus the first quarter of 2022 and 18% overall. Price increases represented the bulk of this at 15%  volume and mix was overall stable and forex fluctuations had a positive impact. Adjusted EBITDA came in at €56 million  up 126% year on year  and 9% quarter on quarter pursuing the recovery shown since Q3 2022. The sales price increase of €85 million offset the €83 million increase of input cost prices. The mix improvement contributed €15 million and gross operating savings €20 million  whereas SG&A was up €9 million reflecting mostly wage inflation. The EBITDA margin thereby rose to 8.5%  up 4.1pp year on year  and 1.0pp quarter on quarter.Q1 2023 FINANCIAL REVIEWCash and balance sheetNet financial debt for the total Group was €880 million at the end of March  not including the proceeds from the Mexican business divestment  compared to €867 million at the start of the year. While EBITDA of the Total Group was up significantly year on year  including €10 million of restructuring and divestment charges  capex increased as anticipated to more than 3% of sales. Financing costs were up reflecting the rise in interest rates on the floating rate portion of the debt  and included the semi-annual coupon payment on the fixed rate bond. Working capital needs increased mainly due to the impact of higher quarter-on-quarter input costs.The leverage ratio decreased further to 5.3x from 6.4x at the end of December 2022  and the peak of 7.7x at the end of September before that. The strong increase in adjusted EBITDA over the last quarters has been driving this reduction in leverage.Following the finalization of the Mexican business divestment  the net proceeds received at closing amounted to approximately €225 million  after deduction of taxes  transaction and hedging expenses as well as balance sheet adjustments. These remain subject to the customary post-closing adjustments. The transaction also includes an additional deferred payment to be received in the next five years of some €40 million  bringing the total net proceeds to approximately €265 million.The divestment proceeds  will be used to reimburse the €220 million term loan by mid-May. This will substantially strengthen Ontex’s debt position with the fixed rate bond at 3.5%  representing about 75% of total gross financial debt excluding leases.DisclaimerThis report may include forward-looking statements.

Thereby continued adjustments including selective pricing is required.Forex fluctuations had a €2 million net negative impact as the positive impact on revenue was more than offset by the year-on-year US dollar appreciation effect on input costs.Total Group (including discontinued operations)Discontinued operations  consisting of the Emerging Markets division  generated a revenue of €206 million  up 17% like for like compared with last year  driven mostly by pricing across regions. Lower volumes in Mexico and the Middle East were offset by volume growth in Brazil and a general mix improvement. Overall revenue growth was 22% year on year  thanks to positive forex fluctuations  with the appreciation of the Mexican peso and Brazilian real more than offsetting the depreciation and hyperinflation impact of the Turkish lira. Adjusted EBITDA came in at €15 million  versus €4 million in 2022  and marking a further increase of 37% versus the fourth quarter of last year. The adjusted EBITDA margin of 7.3%  is up 5.1pp year on year and 2.2pp quarter on quarter.Total Group revenue was €652 million  up 16% like for like versus the first quarter of 2022 and 18% overall. Price increases represented the bulk of this at 15%  volume and mix was overall stable and forex fluctuations had a positive impact. Adjusted EBITDA came in at €56 million  up 126% year on year  and 9% quarter on quarter pursuing the recovery shown since Q3 2022. The sales price increase of €85 million offset the €83 million increase of input cost prices. The mix improvement contributed €15 million and gross operating savings €20 million  whereas SG&A was up €9 million reflecting mostly wage inflation. The EBITDA margin thereby rose to 8.5%  up 4.1pp year on year  and 1.0pp quarter on quarter.Q1 2023 FINANCIAL REVIEWCash and balance sheetNet financial debt for the total Group was €880 million at the end of March  not including the proceeds from the Mexican business divestment  compared to €867 million at the start of the year. While EBITDA of the Total Group was up significantly year on year  including €10 million of restructuring and divestment charges  capex increased as anticipated to more than 3% of sales. Financing costs were up reflecting the rise in interest rates on the floating rate portion of the debt  and included the semi-annual coupon payment on the fixed rate bond. Working capital needs increased mainly due to the impact of higher quarter-on-quarter input costs.The leverage ratio decreased further to 5.3x from 6.4x at the end of December 2022  and the peak of 7.7x at the end of September before that. The strong increase in adjusted EBITDA over the last quarters has been driving this reduction in leverage.Following the finalization of the Mexican business divestment  the net proceeds received at closing amounted to approximately €225 million  after deduction of taxes  transaction and hedging expenses as well as balance sheet adjustments. These remain subject to the customary post-closing adjustments. The transaction also includes an additional deferred payment to be received in the next five years of some €40 million  bringing the total net proceeds to approximately €265 million.The divestment proceeds  will be used to reimburse the €220 million term loan by mid-May. This will substantially strengthen Ontex’s debt position with the fixed rate bond at 3.5%  representing about 75% of total gross financial debt excluding leases.DisclaimerThis report may include forward-looking statements.

The Company will continue to be listed on Euronext Brussels.In connection with the intended delisting  the Company has given formal notice to The Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”) of its intention to voluntarily delist its ADSs. In order to implement the delisting  the Company intends to file a Form 25 with the SEC on or about May 15  2023. The delisting of the Company's ADSs will take effect no earlier than ten days after the date of that Form 25 filing. The Company expects that as a result of this voluntary delisting  the last trading day of its ordinary shares on the Nasdaq Global Market will be on or about May 24  2023. On and after such date  the ADSs of the Company will no longer be listed on the Nasdaq Global Market and whether or not the Company's ADSs will be traded on the over-the-counter market thereafter will depend on the actions of shareholders and independent third parties  without the Company's involvement.As announced by the Company on April 4  2023  Nasdaq notified the Company on March 31  2023 that the Company that it failed to maintain the continued listing requirement under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(b)(1)(A) for the Nasdaq Global Market  which requires that a listed company’s stockholders’ equity be at least $10.0 million. Further  on April 19  2023  as announced by the Company on April 24  2023  the Company received a notice from Nasdaq informing the Company that the minimum closing bid price per share of its ADSs was below $1.00 for a period of 30 consecutive business days and that the Company did not meet the minimum bid price requirement set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(1).The Board of Directors has determined that the voluntary delisting of the Company’s ADSs will be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. The Board’s decision was based on careful review of several factors  including the benefits to the Company of eliminating the costs of being listed on the Nasdaq Global Market and complying with the periodic reporting and related obligations under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934  as amended (the ""Exchange Act"")  as well as eliminating the demands on management’s time of complying with the Nasdaq listing standards.On the date of this announcement  the Company will instruct Citibank  N.A.  as depositary (""Citibank"")  to issue the notice of terminating its ADR facility to the holders of ADSs according to the requirements under the deposit agreement  and the ADR facility will be terminated on or around June 4  2023 (the ""Termination Date""). Prior to termination of the deposit agreement  ADR holders are entitled to surrender their ADSs to Citibank for cancellation  and upon payment of the applicable fees  taxes and charges as provided in the deposit agreement  receive the underlying ordinary shares of the Company. Holders of ADSs should contact Citibank or  to the extent holding ADSs through a bank  broker or other nominee  should contact such bank  broker or nominee with any questions regarding the ADSs.The Company’s reporting obligations under applicable U.S. federal securities laws are expected to continue after the delisting from the Nasdaq Global Market and termination of the ADR facility. Following satisfaction of the relevant deregistration conditions under the applicable U.S. federal securities laws  the Company intends to terminate its reporting obligations under the applicable U.S. federal securities laws and to deregister the ADSs. The Company intends to release further information on such deregistration and termination of reporting obligations at a later date.The Company reserves the right  for any reason  to delay any of the filings described above  to withdraw them prior to effectiveness  and to otherwise change its plans in respect of delisting  termination of the ADR facility and deregistration and termination of its reporting obligations under applicable U.S. federal securities laws in any way.About Celyad OncologyCelyad Oncology is a biotechnology company focused on innovative technologies chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies.
