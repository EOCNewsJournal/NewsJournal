China's Shenzhen and Shanghai took the top two  accounting for 22 per cent and 20 per cent  respectively  and raising $4.7 billion and $4.3 billion.Abu Dhabi was followed by the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite in New York  attracting $2.1 billion for 10 per cent of the market  making the top four and the only bourse to record double-digit shares.The top 10 was rounded out by Indonesia  Hong Kong  Tokyo  Beijing and Italy's Borsa Italiana and AIM.The New York Stock Exchange  Germany's Deutsche Börse and Switzerland's SIX were all tied for 10th place. Other exchanges accounted for 12 per cent  with a value of about $2.9 billion.Overall  about $21.5 billion was raised through 299 IPOs globally in the first quarter of the year. However  these are down from the year-ago figures: proceeds dropped 61 per cent from $54.6 billion and the number of IPOs declined 8 per cent from 326  it said.The challenging IPO environment comes as investors are prioritising value over growth  as IPO windows are “fleeting and funding conditions getting tougher” amid persistent macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty  Paul Go  EY's global IPO leader  wrote in the report.The sector is also being exacerbated by stress in the global banking system  which is rooted in troubles in the US and Credit Suisse  he said.“IPO-bound companies need to focus on building sustainable businesses with strong fundamentals to be well-positioned in a volatile environment and meet the challenges and opportunities of going public ” Mr Go said.Abu Dhabi hosted 2023's biggest IPO when state firm Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (Adnoc) raised about Dh9.1 billion ($2.5 billion) from the sale of a 5 per cent stake in its gas business.This followed an eventful 2022  when there were 48 listings in the Middle East.Adnoc sold more than 3.8 billion shares  with the IPO drawing strong demand from institutional and retail investors  and generating more than $124 billion in orders. It was about 50 times oversubscribed  the company said in March.This is in line with EY's study  which said energy led the IPO market in the first quarter  as four of the top 10 IPOs came from the sector.IPOs continue to deliver the highest number of deals  but average transaction size is dwarfed by the energy sector. This trend is in line with the steep downwards correction in tech company valuations over the past 18 months.With high inflation  uncertainty surrounding the world economy  rising interest rates and the war in Ukraine  Gulf capital markets stood out from their peers in 2022  benefiting from higher oil prices  a liquidity boost and stronger investor confidence.Middle East IPOs raised more than $23 billion in 2022 from 48 listings  compared with $7.52 billion raised from 20 offerings in the previous year. That was the highest share for the Gulf region after 2019  when Saudi Aramco went public in a $29 billion offering  the world’s largest.© Provided by The NationalThe strength of the East's IPO strength is reflected in the EY report: on a regional basis  the Asia-Pacific accounted for $12.7 billion from 175 IPOs  both of which are more than half of the global total.They are  however  annually down 70 per cent and 6 per cent  respectively.The Europe  Middle East  India and Africa region had 84 IPOs that took $6.2 billion  down 19 per cent and 36 per cent  respectively  while the Americas recorded $2.6 billion from 40 IPOs  declining 9 per cent and 11 per cent  respectively.Despite a tepid first quarter  the IPO pipeline continues to build in anticipation of a better window of opportunity  possibly in the latter part of 2023  EY said.“Any initial euphoria at the start of the year was quickly dampened by the unexpected inflation and interest rate outlook  with the mood further stifled by the latest turmoil in the global banking system ” it said.“IPO numbers are holding up but mega transactions are missing in the current quarter  as both investors and companies await better market conditions and a more positive investor sentiment.”,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.22,0.05,0.73,True,English,"['Abu Dhabi', 'global IPOs', 'first quarter', 'The New York Stock Exchange', 'Abu Dhabi National Oil Company', 'Global IPO Trends report', 'challenging global IPO market', 'higher oil prices', 'global banking system', 'The UAE capital', 'Deutsche Börse', 'average transaction size', 'steep downwards correction', 'rising interest rates', 'stronger investor confidence', 'interest rate outlook', 'positive investor sentiment', 'global IPO leader', 'challenging IPO environment', 'initial public offerings', 'Gulf capital markets', 'tepid first quarter', '5 per cent stake', 'The National', 'Middle East IPOs', 'global total', 'company valuations', 'new study', 'volatile environment', 'Gulf region', 'initial euphoria', 'IPO windows', 'biggest IPO', 'IPO pipeline', 'IPO numbers', 'Asian markets', 'market conditions', 'current quarter', '14 per cent', '22 per cent', '20 per cent', '10 per cent', '12 per cent', '11 per cent', '$3 billion worth', 'three months', 'latest edition', 'double-digit shares', 'Hong Kong', 'Borsa Italiana', '10th place', 'Other exchanges', 'year-ago figures', 'funding conditions', 'persistent macroeconomic', 'Paul Go', 'Credit Suisse', 'sustainable businesses', 'strong fundamentals', 'Mr Go', 'state firm', 'gas business', '3.8 billion shares', 'strong demand', 'past 18 months', 'high inflation', 'liquidity boost', 'highest share', 'Saudi Aramco', '$29 billion offering', 'regional basis', 'Africa region', 'latter part', 'unexpected inflation', 'latest turmoil', 'mega transactions', 'IPO proceeds', 'IPO strength', 'EY report', 'six spots', 'geopolitical uncertainty', 'IPO-bound companies', 'highest number', 'world economy', 'retail investors', 'previous year', 'energy sector', 'top 10 IPOs', '20 offerings', '19 per', '36 per', '299 IPOs', '175 IPOs', '84 IPOs', '40 IPOs', 'indication', 'March', 'consultancy', 'China', 'Shenzhen', 'Shanghai', 'bourse', 'Indonesia', 'Tokyo', 'Beijing', 'Italy', 'AIM', 'Germany', 'Switzerland', 'value', 'growth', 'stress', 'troubles', 'challenges', 'opportunities', 'Adnoc', 'sale', 'eventful', '48 listings', 'institutional', 'orders', 'deals', 'Ukraine', 'peers', 'Asia-Pacific', 'half', 'Europe', 'India', 'Americas', 'anticipation', 'opportunity', 'start', 'mood']",2023-05-07,2023-05-07,msn.com
