The network will bind together blockchain apps that were created using Daml — a smart-contract language created by Digital Asset  the blockchain startup formerly led by ex JPMorgan senior executive Blythe Masters and backed by some of the world’s largest financial institutions. Participants in the Canton Network  which will start testing some features in July  say the system offers better privacy and controls than currently available. At the same time  it will achieve a scale and standard appropriate for financial institutions  according to a statement released by the companies on Tuesday.Part of the effort has revolved around exploring ways to transform traditional securities  like stocks and bonds  into tokens on a blockchain. Others have focused on speeding up trading and settlement of various assets  or facilitating international payments. While various systems have been tested and some applications have gone live  such blockchain networks have yet to be taken up on a large scale. Banks and other large corporations have been developing and testing blockchain applications for years in the hope they can simplify and speed up some of their most complex processes.Also Read Microsoft 365 Copilot: Microsoft is bringing AI to its productivity apps Tesla chief Elon Musk threatens to sue Microsoft for using data 'illegally' Microsoft may soon roll out built-in VPN support in Edge for stable users Microsoft Teams gets instant polls  schedule send  other features: Details Goldman Sachs agrees to pay $215 mn to end case on underpaying women Crypto exchange Bittrex files for bankruptcy  no impact on global business Bitcoin based-memecoin 'PePe' surge seen driving Binance anxiety Chinese users of Binance  FTX show holes in Beijing's cryptocurrency ban Bitcoin perpetuals becoming an even bigger driver of digital token's price Bitcoin trading volume tanks massively by 58% to $492.9 billion in AprilPart of what’s holding the existing applications back is their inability to connect different blockchain systems built by various organizations  while at the same time allowing creators to retain the controls and privacy required in regulated financial markets  the network’s proponents said. As a so-called “network of networks ” Canton claims it can overcome this by allowing systems to work together without requiring the entities that run them give up control.Growing ReachThis may also enable firms to link in systems that are separate in today’s market — for example  asset registries and cash payment systems  the statement said.Systems like Canton are “a key building block for future digital and distributed financial market infrastructures ” according to Jens Hachmeister  head of issuer services and new digital markets at Deutsche Börse Group. Currently  Canton can connect existing applications built using Daml — such as Goldman’s Digital Asset Platform  a system for issuing assets on the blockchain — with Deutsche Börse Group’s D7 post trade platform  the statement said.

The Canton Network enables financial institutions to experience a safer and reconciliation-free environment where assets  data  and cash can synchronize freely across applications.

With the Canton Network  a digital bond and a digital payment can be composed across two separate applications into a single atomic transaction  guaranteeing simultaneous exchange without operational risk. Likewise  a digital asset could be used in a collateralized financial transaction via connection to a repo or leveraged loan application.Story continuesCapturing the benefits of public blockchains without the flawsUntil now  smart contract blockchain networks have not achieved meaningful adoption among financial institutions and other enterprises because of three significant shortfalls:The lack of privacy and control over data : other chains have shortcomings around privacy that prevent the use of the technology by multiple regulated participants on the same network. There are currently no other blockchains that can offer data protection or control at any layer of its network.Other b lockchains have had to accept trade-offs between control and interoperability : other chains require operators to forfeit their full control of applications by using a shared pool of validators to gain interoperability.The inability to scale: with applications competing for global network resources and the inherent capacity limitations caused by how public blockchains operate  achieving the scale and performance financial institutions need remains challenging.The Canton Network removes these obstacles by uniquely balancing the decentralization of a network with privacy and control essential to operating within a safe and sound regulatory environment. Only the Canton Network enables participants to safeguard permissions  exposure  and interactions across the network  to comply with security  regulatory and legal requirements.The network can connect innovative blockchain solutions in market today  such as Deutsche Börse Group’s D7 post-trade platform and Goldman Sachs’ GS DAP™  while retaining privacy and permissioning. As more Daml-built applications go into production this year and beyond  the number of connections on the Canton Network will grow exponentially. For example  one application's monthly notional traded exceeds the most active crypto token volumes.Canton Network participants will begin testing interoperability capabilities across a range of applications and use cases in July.For more information  click here to download our whitepaper or visit us at www.canton.network to learn more.Notes to the editorHere is what market participants have to say about the Canton Network.""The Canton Network is another example of Capgemini and our partners harnessing the power of blockchain to build a financial ecosystem that everyone can depend on.

24480,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://www.thetradenews.com/goldman-sachs-cboe-and-digital-asset-among-participants-in-new-global-blockchain-network/,Goldman Sachs  Cboe and Digital Asset among participants in new global blockchain network,Landmark initiative between some of the largest organisations across the capital markets creates a ‘network of networks’ allowing siloed systems to interoperate while balancing the decentralisation with privacy and control.,Some of the biggest players in the financial markets have united to launch Canton Network  dubbed the industry’s first privacy-enabled interoperable blockchain network designed for institutional assets.By creating a ‘network of networks’  Canton will allow previously siloed systems in financial markets to interoperate with the appropriate governance  privacy  permissioning and controls required for highly regulated industries.Among those involved are BNP Paribas  Cboe  Deutsche Börse Group and Goldman Sachs.According to a statement  the intention is that the Canton Network is “built to responsibly unlock the potential of synchronised financial markets”.The initiative is looking to help overcome some of the issues around public blockchains such as the lack of privacy and control over data  the inability to scale  and a lack of interoperability.The Canton Network will provide a decentralised infrastructure that connects independent applications built with Daml  Digital Asset’s smart-contract language.“For the first time  financial institutions can realise the full benefits of a global blockchain network while operating within the regulatory guardrails that ensure a safe  sound  and fair financial system ” said Yuval Rooz  co-founder and CEO at Digital Asset.“This is a significant step forward for the blockchain space. We look forward to helping this founding group of network operators and users build and connect applications to the Canton Network.”The Canton Network will aim to enable financial institutions to experience a safer and reconciliation-free environment where assets  data  and cash can synchronise freely across applications.This result could create opportunities for financial institutions to offer innovative new products to their clients while enhancing their efficiency and risk management.In a statement from the combined Canton Network  the example given was how asset registers and cash payment systems are “distinct and siloed systems” in today’s markets  but through the new initiative  a digital bond and a digital payment can be composed across two separate applications into a single atomic transaction  guaranteeing simultaneous exchange without operational risk. Likewise  a digital asset could be used in a collateralised financial transaction via connection to a repo or leveraged loan application.The other firms involved in the Network include ASX  Broadridge  Capgemini  Deutsche Börse Group  DRW  EquiLend  Microsoft  Moody’s  Paxos and SBI Digital Asset Holdings.,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.31,0.19,0.5,True,English,"['new global blockchain network', 'Goldman Sachs', 'Digital Asset', 'Cboe', 'participants', 'Deutsche Börse Group', 'privacy-enabled interoperable blockchain network', 'SBI Digital Asset Holdings', 'single atomic transaction', 'leveraged loan application', 'innovative new products', 'fair financial system', 'collateralised financial transaction', 'global blockchain network', 'two separate applications', 'The Canton Network', 'combined Canton Network', 'synchronised financial markets', 'cash payment systems', 'founding group', 'blockchain space', 'digital payment', 'asset registers', 'financial institutions', 'network operators', 'siloed systems', 'digital bond', 'biggest players', 'appropriate governance', 'regulated industries', 'BNP Paribas', 'Goldman Sachs', 'public blockchains', 'decentralised infrastructure', 'smart-contract language', 'first time', 'full benefits', 'regulatory guardrails', 'Yuval Rooz', 'significant step', 'reconciliation-free environment', 'risk management', 'new initiative', 'simultaneous exchange', 'operational risk', 'other firms', 'independent applications', 'institutional assets', 'industry', 'networks', 'permissioning', 'controls', 'Cboe', 'statement', 'intention', 'potential', 'issues', 'lack', 'data', 'inability', 'scale', 'interoperability', 'Daml', 'founder', 'CEO', 'users', 'safer', 'result', 'opportunities', 'clients', 'efficiency', 'example', 'distinct', 'today', 'connection', 'repo', 'ASX', 'Broadridge', 'Capgemini', 'DRW', 'EquiLend', 'Microsoft', 'Moody', 'Paxos']",2023-05-09,2023-05-09,thetradenews.com

The Project involves manufacturing and distributing 150 000 energy-efficient cookstoves and is designed as a verified CO2-reduction project.DGB is a project developer of nature-based projects to originate high-integrity carbon credits (""Carbon credits"")  also commonly known as carbon offsets. Each Carbon credit equals one tonne of verified emissions reduction.On 31 August 2022  a renowned buyer (the ""Buyer"") committed to buy 507 720 Carbon credits from the Project and provide DGB with cash payments of €1.7 million upon achieving certain milestones. The Project advanced to the subsequent phase as its Project Design Document was submitted to an external auditor. DGB received €450 000 for accomplishing this milestone on May 5th.The Buyer plans to retire its share of the Carbon credits once verified  claiming it against its organisation's carbon footprint. DGB expects to sell the remaining expected 1.3 million Carbon credits (approximately 70 25% of the Project's total) on the open  voluntary carbon credit market after the first issuance of the Carbon credits starts.CEO Duijvestijn stated  ""As a prominent carbon project developer and ecosystem restoration company  DGB Group is dedicated to positively impacting the planet and achieving robust financial growth. These payments showcase DGB's capacity to generate cash flow during the development of our projects. Our projects not only reduce CO2 emissions but also greatly benefits local communities.
