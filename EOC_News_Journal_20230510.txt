The market implied volatility measure VStoxx® dropped from 19.4% to 17.4% while iTraxx Crossover® (S38) tightened slightly from 406bps to 402bps over the month. Against this backdrop BG Fund (USD A) was up strongly in April delivering +182bps overall  with the main contribution coming from Equity risk arbitrage and special situations along with the Convertible Bond arbitrage strategies. April 2023 COMMENTARY Volatility strategies Mandatory convertible bond arbitrage Mandatory convertible bonds contributed +1bps this month. Convertible bond arbitrage Convertible bonds contributed +26bps to the performance of the fund in April with around a third of the performance coming from European convertible bond positions. On the whole  European CBs were flattish in a secondary market which saw relatively thin trading volumes. BG Fund's performance this month is due to specific situations and some active trading. A gap appeared between realized and implied volatility and we took profits in a few situations where we felt the implied volatility valuation was fair. Primary saw just one €250m offering from VoestAlpine  an Austrian steel company which in our view was issued with good terms for investors. We are anticipating that the primary market will be more active after the earnings season (mid-May). US CB market remained quite tense throughout the entire month of April primarily because the broader equity  rates  credit  and volatility markets were all lacking in direction. The robust performance in April can be mainly attributed to active gamma trading. As a specific example  Wolfspeed  a semiconductor company  reported poor earnings and the stock was down 25% in three trading days which enabled us to deliver decent performance from gamma trading despite the CB having a three-year maturity. Similarly  we had good performance coming from positions in the CBs of Altair Engineering and Chart Industries both of which saw relatively big moves up and down in their shares. Volatility Trading Volatility trading was very slightly down (-1bps) in April. Realised volatility vs implied forwards at the end of March**: 30d Implied vol Realised vol over the Difference level on 31/03/23 month US (VIX®) 18.70 12.39 -6.32 EUROPE (Vstoxx®) 19.42 7.14 -12.28 Variation of implied volatilities during April *: ** Source: Bloomberg 2 Mar. Vol Index Fut Mar. Vol Index Fut as Vol move as of 31/03/23 of 28/04/23 US (VIX®) 22.13 18.44 -3.69 EUROPE (Vstoxx®) 21.50 19.25 -2.25 During the month both realised and implied volatility drifted much lower. In a number of markets volatility has fallen to low levels that have not been seen since Covid. The decrease in volatility has occurred in a very steady manner  with few opportunities to trade around existing positions or identify discrepancies. Despite the negative carry of our long vol position  we remain cautious however we are carefully looking for opportunities to grow the portfolio. Warrant arbitrage Warrant arbitrage contributed +3bps in April. Equity strategies Equity strategies returned +120bp in April driven by the special situations and risk arbitrage positions  many of which benefited from a long-awaited revival in corporate activity. In terms of specifics  our investment in National Instrument Corp performed well. Following a takeover approach by Emerson Electric in January at a price of $53  we built a position as it was clear that a competitive sales process was going to take place with other parties driving the price higher. This process finally led to an improved offer at $60 by Emerson  which was confirmed mid-April. In addition  we saw numerous new deals announced or approaches confirmed during April which has helped to generate further positive contribution to performance. Almost all of these new opportunities have exciting potential. Many of the deals involved private equity sponsors who have recently become very active and have even started to compete with each other. For example  EQT bid on Dechra  CVC and Francisco Partners are bidding for Network International and Silverlake is bidding for Software AG. Corporates have also become more active in the M&A space with Teleperformance bidding on Majorel  Sega Sammy on Rovio Entertainment and Deutsche Boerse on Simcorp to name just a few. We believe this environment should be supportive for the strategy. Credit strategies Credit long / short Credit long / short contributed +7bp this month  helped in particular by a decent improvement in CGG. Credit special situations Credit special situations contributed +8bps in April. Credit indices were range-bound over April and ended the month close to their tightest levels in the last 12 months. This low volatility in credit indices and the strong pipeline of primary issuance reflects a surprisingly constructive environment in credit overall. Trading Trading contributed +18bps in April with positive contributions from systematic trading and macro. Interestingly all buckets within the systematic trading portfolio were profitable in April. Soft commodities appreciated markedly  especially sugar and orange juice as well as live cattle  generating good profits while 3 a short position on grains benefited from a correction. Rates also made a solid positive contribution  primarily benefiting from short SONIA contracts. Macro trading was up in April benefiting from the view that inflation would be stickier in Europe than the US  leading the ECB to a more aggressive rate hiking trajectory. We think that the US economic outlook could deteriorate quite quickly over the coming months  while conversely equity risk premia now look much too low when compared to front-end rates leaving equity markets quite exposed.

The market implied volatility measure VStoxx® dropped from 19.4% to 17.4% while iTraxx Crossover® (S38) tightened slightly from 406bps to 402bps over the month. Against this backdrop BG Fund (USD A) was up strongly in April delivering +182bps overall  with the main contribution coming from Equity risk arbitrage and special situations along with the Convertible Bond arbitrage strategies. April 2023 COMMENTARY Volatility strategies Mandatory convertible bond arbitrage Mandatory convertible bonds contributed +1bps this month. Convertible bond arbitrage Convertible bonds contributed +26bps to the performance of the fund in April with around a third of the performance coming from European convertible bond positions. On the whole  European CBs were flattish in a secondary market which saw relatively thin trading volumes. BG Fund's performance this month is due to specific situations and some active trading. A gap appeared between realized and implied volatility and we took profits in a few situations where we felt the implied volatility valuation was fair. Primary saw just one €250m offering from VoestAlpine  an Austrian steel company which in our view was issued with good terms for investors. We are anticipating that the primary market will be more active after the earnings season (mid-May). US CB market remained quite tense throughout the entire month of April primarily because the broader equity  rates  credit  and volatility markets were all lacking in direction. The robust performance in April can be mainly attributed to active gamma trading. As a specific example  Wolfspeed  a semiconductor company  reported poor earnings and the stock was down 25% in three trading days which enabled us to deliver decent performance from gamma trading despite the CB having a three-year maturity. Similarly  we had good performance coming from positions in the CBs of Altair Engineering and Chart Industries both of which saw relatively big moves up and down in their shares. Volatility Trading Volatility trading was very slightly down (-1bps) in April. Realised volatility vs implied forwards at the end of March**: 30d Implied vol Realised vol over the Difference level on 31/03/23 month US (VIX®) 18.70 12.39 -6.32 EUROPE (Vstoxx®) 19.42 7.14 -12.28 Variation of implied volatilities during April *: ** Source: Bloomberg 2 Mar. Vol Index Fut Mar. Vol Index Fut as Vol move as of 31/03/23 of 28/04/23 US (VIX®) 22.13 18.44 -3.69 EUROPE (Vstoxx®) 21.50 19.25 -2.25 During the month both realised and implied volatility drifted much lower. In a number of markets volatility has fallen to low levels that have not been seen since Covid. The decrease in volatility has occurred in a very steady manner  with few opportunities to trade around existing positions or identify discrepancies. Despite the negative carry of our long vol position  we remain cautious however we are carefully looking for opportunities to grow the portfolio. Warrant arbitrage Warrant arbitrage contributed +3bps in April. Equity strategies Equity strategies returned +120bp in April driven by the special situations and risk arbitrage positions  many of which benefited from a long-awaited revival in corporate activity. In terms of specifics  our investment in National Instrument Corp performed well. Following a takeover approach by Emerson Electric in January at a price of $53  we built a position as it was clear that a competitive sales process was going to take place with other parties driving the price higher. This process finally led to an improved offer at $60 by Emerson  which was confirmed mid-April. In addition  we saw numerous new deals announced or approaches confirmed during April which has helped to generate further positive contribution to performance. Almost all of these new opportunities have exciting potential. Many of the deals involved private equity sponsors who have recently become very active and have even started to compete with each other. For example  EQT bid on Dechra  CVC and Francisco Partners are bidding for Network International and Silverlake is bidding for Software AG. Corporates have also become more active in the M&A space with Teleperformance bidding on Majorel  Sega Sammy on Rovio Entertainment and Deutsche Boerse on Simcorp to name just a few. We believe this environment should be supportive for the strategy. Credit strategies Credit long / short Credit long / short contributed +7bp this month  helped in particular by a decent improvement in CGG. Credit special situations Credit special situations contributed +8bps in April. Credit indices were range-bound over April and ended the month close to their tightest levels in the last 12 months. This low volatility in credit indices and the strong pipeline of primary issuance reflects a surprisingly constructive environment in credit overall. Trading Trading contributed +18bps in April with positive contributions from systematic trading and macro. Interestingly all buckets within the systematic trading portfolio were profitable in April. Soft commodities appreciated markedly  especially sugar and orange juice as well as live cattle  generating good profits while 3 a short position on grains benefited from a correction. Rates also made a solid positive contribution  primarily benefiting from short SONIA contracts. Macro trading was up in April benefiting from the view that inflation would be stickier in Europe than the US  leading the ECB to a more aggressive rate hiking trajectory. We think that the US economic outlook could deteriorate quite quickly over the coming months  while conversely equity risk premia now look much too low when compared to front-end rates leaving equity markets quite exposed.

The internationally acclaimed prize aims to recognise and promote contemporary photographers who have made significant contributions to the medium of photography through their innovative and impactful work.Following this visual overload  it was now on us to head out and photograph the streets of London  which resulted in some amazing imagery exhibiting the beauty of London’s streets.Again  this fine exhibition is open until Sunday 11 June 2023.This exhibit celebrates a clandestine visual culture of men’s bodies which emerged in the post-war period all around London – a time in which making and distributing such images was a criminal offence. It’s visual and spatial mapping outlines a territory of risk and possibility across the capital.Whilst the works of the Deutsche Börse Awards showcase would have already given us enough visual inspiration to head out and take our own photos  we were lucky enough to also be able and explore the second exhibition currently on display at the gallery: A Hard Man is Good to Find.You can see each nominee’s works exhibited until Sunday 11 June 2023  with the winner announced on Thursday 11 May 2023.The group had a chance to look at the amazing artworks of 3 photographers. Bieke Deeporter explores the complex ethical relationships and boundaries between photographer and subject. Arthur Jafa articulates Black experiences in his work  and Frida Orupabo reimagines the historical Black female body through her multi-layered collages.Related linksA thriving online magazine of our postgraduate student voices sharing thought-provoking experiences  practices  thoughts and articles about what matters to them.Download the PDF Guide to writing articles for Post-Grad StoriesWant to write an article?

We are now progressing through the preparation steps for this merger  and  as our teams have started intensive interactions in that respect  we already see a remarkable match of our respective capabilities and prospects for fruitful synergies.”  said Gil Beyen  Chief Executive Officer of ERYTECH. “The Management and Board of ERYTECH are convinced that the strategic choice of combining with Pherecydes and creating a champion in AMR is of the best interest of ERYTECH and its stakeholders  and will be pleased to propose this ambitious strategic move for approval to the Company’s shareholders at the next General Assembly Meeting in June. For the sake of transparency  we inform the market that ERYTECH was recently contacted by a new shareholder  Akkadian Partners  who shared with us its opposition to ERYTECH’s merger project with the objective to conduct alternative acquisition projects through ERYTECH. After due consideration by Management and the Board of directors of ERYTECH  these alternative ideas were deemed not to be in the best interest of ERYTECH and its stakeholders and certainly not of sufficient robustness and value to distract the Company from its strategic direction.”Story continuesBusiness HighlightsCombination with Pherecydes announced and merger process on track for proposed closing in JuneOn February 15  2023  the Company announced the strategic combination with Pherecydes  a biotechnology company specializing in precision phage therapy to treat resistant and/or complicated bacterial infections  with the ambition to create a global leader in extended phage therapy and accelerate the development of a portfolio of phage candidates targeting pathogenic bacteria. This transaction is the result of the extensive strategic review process announced by ERYTECH on several occasions since November 2021.The combination will draw on the complementary expertise and resources of the two companies to accelerate the development of a French phage therapy industry  aimed at combating antibiotic resistance  a globally recognized health issue  and at extending this technology to other therapeutic areas with significant unmet medical needs.ERYTECH and PHERECYDES intend to merge their operations and relocate all teams to ERYTECH’s premises in Lyon  where they will benefit from presence in a major European hub for infectious diseases.The proposed transaction is structured as a merger of PHERECYDES into ERYTECH  pursuant to which the shareholders of PHERECYDES would receive newly issued ERYTECH ordinary shares in consideration of the contribution of the assets and liabilities of PHERECYDES. The fairness of the exchange ratio will be reviewed by a court-appointed independent appraiser (commissaire à la fusion). His report will be made publicly available prior to the extraordinary shareholders meeting of ERYTECH and PHERECYDES  together with the required exemption document in relation to the merger in accordance with applicable laws.The extraordinary general meetings of ERYTECH and PHERECYDES shareholders will be called upon to vote on the proposed merger  currently expected to be convened on June 23  2023. The proposed transaction is expected to close shortly after the approval by the shareholders.This project is supported by the Boards of Directors and major shareholders of ERYTECH and PHERECYDES.Akkadian PartnersOn April 17  2023  Akkadian Partners  an entity domiciled in Luxembourg and acting on behalf of the Akkadian Partners Fund  declared that on April 13  2023  they crossed the threshold of 5% of the share capital of ERYTECH Pharma and held 5.06% of the share capital and 4.83% of the voting rights of the company.On May 1st  2023  Akkadian Partners informed the Board of ERYTECH that they intended to oppose the project of merging with Pherecydes and take de facto control of ERYTECH with a view to pursue alternative acquisition projects with ERYTECH's cash.In that context  the Management and Board of ERYTECH have reviewed and assessed the ideas of acquisitions projects mentioned by Akkadian  with the assistance of external financial and legal advisers. After due consideration  ERYTECH determined that these ideas  were not in the best interest of ERYTECH and its stakeholders  and remote from ERYTECH’s strategy and identity  with significant uncertainty and risks associated with these projects.It is worth noting that Akkadian indicated that they are committed to increase their stake in ERYTECH up to 15% of the share capital in the short term and around 25% in the mid-term (i.e.  below the 30% threshold triggering the obligation to file a mandatory tender offer on ERYTECH). Although Akkadian does not seem to intend to acquire a controlling stake in ERYTECH  it requested the appointment of 4 directors (and the resignation of 5 incumbent directors) which would represent the majority of ERYTECH's Board. Such attempt to gain de facto control of ERYTECH without filing a tender offer on ERYTECH and without offering liquidity to minority shareholders is hostile and will be strongly rejected. Note that ERYTECH is not aware of any further acquisitions of ERYTECH shares completed by Akkadian.ERYTECH  while confirming its strategic decision to merge with Pherecydes  will oppose any financial predation project which would not be in the best interest of the company and its stakeholders.Update on Q1 2023 Financial Results and Cash positionAs of March 31  2023  ERYTECH had cash and cash equivalents totaling €30.5 million (approximately $33.7 million)  compared with €38.8 million as of December 31  2022. The €8.3 million net decrease in cash position during the first quarter of 2023 was the result of a €7.5 million net cash utilization in operating activities and investing activities  including a one-off €1.2 million expense for restructuring and pre-merger activities  and €0.6 million used in financing activities  with the start of the scheduled repayment of the 2020  €10 million government-guaranteed ‘Covid-19’ loan. The variation of the U.S. dollar against the euro led to a €0.2 million negative currency exchange impact.At the current stage of transition activities in view of the proposed merger with Pherecydes  the Company confirms its earlier guidance that its current cash position can fund its current activities and planned operating expenses to the second half of 2024.Given the ongoing preparation of the announced business combination with Pherecydes  which includes the preparation of proforma accounts and the review with market regulators  the Company will not provide interim quarterly P&L information for Q1 2023.2023 Financial Calendar*Shareholders’ Meeting: June 23  2023  at 9.30am CEST - ParisBusiness Update and Financial Highlights for the Second Quarter & First Half of 2023: September 11  2023 (after U.S. market close)  followed by a conference call & webcast on September 12  2023 (2:30pm CET/8:30am ET)Business Update and Financial Highlights for the Third Quarter of 2023: November 6  2023 (after U.S. market close)  followed by a conference call & webcast on November 7  2023 (2:30pm CET/8:30am ET)(*): Information subject to change.About ERYTECHERYTECH is a biopharmaceutical company developing innovative red blood cell-based therapeutics for severe forms of cancer and orphan diseases.

ColoNode® will be distributed as a manual kit by Biocartis to expert laboratories in selected European countries.CRC is the third most common cancer type in the world with an estimated 1.9 million new cases and 0.9 million deaths per year worldwide1. 70-90% of CRC patients may undergo surgical resection of the tumor. International guidelines2 have introduced the tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging system  that assesses primary tumor (T)  lymph node metastasis (N)  and distant metastasis (M) to predict disease recurrence and survival. As a key component in this staging system  lymph nodes that are contained in the resected section of the colon  are inspected for presence of disseminated tumor cells. Lymph node status is also a key factor in deciding on post-operative adjuvant chemotherapy. The routine method of determining lymph node status (pN) is microscopic examination of H&E3 stained lymph node tissue sections  that has limitations: it is insensitive and subjective  requires specially trained pathologists  examines < 1% of the lymph node volume and cannot differentiate between aggressive and relatively harmless tumor cells.ColoNode® is a CE-marked IVD gene expression test that detects and characterizes tumor cells in post-operative CRC lymph node samples. The ColoNode® kit can analyze up to 100% of the lymph node volume and is more sensitive in detecting tumor cells than H&E staining. Additionally  the test provides an estimation of the risk of CRC recurrence based on the tumor aggressiveness markers included in the ColoNode® kit4.Story continuesThe partnership will initially focus on the commercialization of the ColoNode® CE-marked IVD manual kit in selected European countries by Biocartis. Following commercial uptake of the manual kit  HiloProbe and Biocartis will consider developing a fully automated version of the test on Biocartis’ decentralized Idylla™ platform.Roger Moody  Chief Executive Officer of Biocartis  commented: “We are pleased to partner with HiloProbe on the distribution of the ColoNode® kit. This allows us to broaden our product offering to customers in the colorectal cancer domain  complementing tests for RAS biomarkers and MSI on our Idylla™ platform. The collaboration supports our mission to maximize patient access to precision medicine in oncology.”Lina Olsson  Chief Executive Officer of HiloProbe  added: “We are very happy to start a collaboration and a long-term relationship with Biocartis  which strengthens our focus on colorectal cancer thanks to Biocartis’ established sales and distribution network across many countries. Further development of a fully automated version of ColoNode® on the Idylla™ platform also holds great potential for ColoNode® to contribute faster and more easily to the safer selection of patients who could benefit from postoperative adjuvant treatment.”----- END ----More information:Renate DegraveHead of Corporate Communications & Investor Relations Biocartise-mail rdegrave@biocartis.comtel +32 15 631 729mobile +32 471 53 60 64About BiocartisWith its revolutionary and proprietary Idylla™ platform  Biocartis (Euronext Brussels: BCART) aspires to enable personalized medicine for patients around the world through universal access to molecular testing  by making molecular testing actionable  convenient  fast and suitable for any lab.

The founders consist of a group of scientists  who have collaborated for more than 15 years in an academic setting and have produced high quality original research focusing on the development of clinically useful biomarkers in colorectal cancer. The research has been focused on analysis of the regional lymph nodes in the resected specimen. The reason is that the lymph node is the first site where metastasizing cancer cells will occur. We have now discovered a limited number of biomarkers that  when analyzed together  identify tumor cells in the lymph node and grade tumor cell aggressiveness i.e. their propensity to metastasize to distant sites. A product (ColoNode®)  based on biomarker mRNA analysis  has been developed. The aim is to bring ColoNode® to the market to save people´s lives and aid in the development of more efficient treatment of colorectal cancer.Biocartis and Idylla™ are registered trademarks in Europe  the United States and other countries.

Ltd. (“Mitsui”) acting as an anchor investor in the convertible bond subscribing for NOK 500 million.Successfully transferred from Euronext Growth Oslo to the main list of the Oslo Stock Exchange.In the first quarter of 2023  Hexagon Purus (“the Company” or “Purus” or “the Group”) generated NOK 244 million in revenue  up 53% year-over-year from NOK 159 million in the first quarter of 2022. Hexagon Purus continues to experience strong demand for its hydrogen infrastructure solutions  and the year-over-year growth is mainly driven by increased sales of hydrogen distribution modules and mobile hydrogen refueling systems for industrial and mobility purposes. Total operating expenses in the first quarter of 2023 ended at NOK 356 (252) million  which led to an operating profit before depreciation (EBITDA) of NOK -112 (-93) million.Total assets at the end of the first quarter of 2023 amounted to NOK 3 935 (2 526) million. The year-over-year increase in total assets is mainly driven by increases to property  plant and equipment and right-of-use assets due to the Company’s ongoing capacity expansion programs  combined with an increase in cash and short-term deposits. Increases in equity and non-current liabilities as a result of the NOK 500 million (gross) equity and NOK 800 million (gross) convertible bond private placements in March were the main drivers of the increase in total equity and liabilities. The weakened NOK during the first quarter of 2023 also had an impact on balance sheet positions in the Company's subsidiaries that is recognized in EUR and USD. At quarter-end  the Company’s equity ratio was 60% (74%).Story continuesNet cash flow from operating activities in the first quarter of 2023 was NOK -119 (-73) million  of which NOK 18 (58) million was build-up of net working capital. Net cash flow from investing was NOK -106 (-63) million in the first quarter of 2023  of which NOK 95 million primarily related to investments in equipment and buildings for the ongoing capacity expansion programs. Net cash flow from financing in the first quarter of 2023 was NOK 1 244 million  mainly driven by the issuance of NOK 500 million (gross) in new equity and NOK 800 million (gross) in convertible bonds in the quarter. Net change in cash and cash equivalents in the first quarter of 2023 was NOK 1 019 (438) million and cash and cash equivalents ended at NOK 1 366 (890) million. Liquidity was deemed satisfactory at the end of the first quarter of 2023.""It has been an exciting quarter with several large commercial and strategic successes  which are all additive to the future prospects of Hexagon Purus. While continuing to grow the business  we have also secured a deepened strategic partnership with Mitsui & Co  as well landmark agreements with both Hino and Panasonic  says Morten Holum  CEO of Hexagon Purus. “With another strong quarter behind us  we are confident in our ability to deliver on our short- and long-term ambitions”.Outlook:Hexagon Purus’ customer interactions are positively influenced by the strong legislative backdrop  and customer demand for the Company’s products and services is expected to further accelerate going forward. Hexagon Purus has been successful in securing several long-term agreements recently  which gives the Company confidence in its medium to long-term targets.

24562,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/theranexus-bbdf-win-fda-approval-053000992.html,Theranexus and BBDF Win FDA Approval on Efficacy Endpoints for the Phase III Trial to Evaluate Batten-1 in CLN3 Batten Disease,Theranexus  a biopharmaceutical company innovating in the treatment of neurological diseases  and the Beyond Batten Disease Foundation (BBDF)  have today...,"Phase III's primary endpoint will be visual acuity  with secondary endpoints including assessment of cognitive and motor functions The FDA confirmed that this sole Phase III trial would secure Batten-1 approval for Batten CLN3 disease.LYON  FRANCE and AUSTIN  TX / ACCESSWIRE / May 9  2023 / Theranexus  a biopharmaceutical company innovating in the treatment of neurological diseases  and the Beyond Batten Disease Foundation (BBDF)  have today announced receipt of approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the design and primary and secondary endpoints of the pivotal Phase III trial for Batten disease CLN3  at a meeting with the Division of Rare Diseases and Medical Genetics (DRDMG) held in mid-April."" We are delighted with the constructive discussions we had with the FDA on defining the endpoints of Batten-1 and the design of our pivotal Phase III trial. Its valuable guidance allows us to get fully prepared for the trial launch "" explained Theranexus' Chief Medical Officer Marie Sebille."" We would like to thank the FDA for its support  which is fundamental to the development of our Batten-1 drug candidate  the only asset in active clinical development for Batten disease (CLN3). Our pivotal Phase III trial will enable us to gain approval for Batten-1  and also deliver rich news flow throughout the duration of the Phase III trial thanks to the parallel open-label patient cohort. More generally  we have no doubt that we can deliver a therapeutic response for patients suffering from Batten disease "" added Theranexus' CEO Mathieu Charvériat.Theranexus and BBDF worked with the FDA's DRDMG to define the following criteria for the protocol of the Phase III multicenter trial for evaluating Batten-1 in patients with juvenile Batten disease (CLN3):The trial will be a randomized  double-blind study conducted versus placebo in 2 parallel groups to assess the efficacy of Batten-1 at a dose of 15 mg/kg and up to 600 mg/day for a 2-year treatment period The target population will be a pediatric cohort involving approximately 60 patients aged 4 to 16 years  with randomization stratified into 3 age groups of 4 to 8 years  9 to 12 years and 13 to 16 years to achieve suitable representation for all age groups assessed The primary endpoint will be visual acuity  measured using either the quantitative LogMAR[1] scale  or a qualitative scale in the most impaired patients for whom quantitative assessment is not possible The secondary endpoints will include cognitive function  assessed by the Verbal Comprehension Index from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children according to age  motor function assessed by a selection of motor items from the Unified Batten Disease Rating Scale (UBDRS)  and visual function  assessed by OCT scan An assessment of functional ability in everyday activities and a Quality-of-Life measurement will also be performed.Story continuesAn additional open-label cohort of 9 patients' representative of the different age groups of the target population will be enrolled in parallel. This will allow us to enrich the statistical analysis plan  in particular in comparison with natural history data  for the primary and secondary endpoints on trial completion  and produce interim results every 6 months  including measurements of biomarkers (notably glycosphingolipids given their toxic accumulation resulting in neuronal death) and efficacy data on the same criteria as the main 60-patient cohort.Patient enrollment should begin in the end of 2023. The trial will run in parallel in several centers throughout the United States and Europe. Provided positive results are registered  the FDA confirms that a sole Phase III trial as defined above would secure approval of the Batten-1 candidate in Batten disease. The company's goal is to use the results of this trial to win product approval in both the United States and Europe.As a reminder  the Phase III trial follows on from Phase I/II whose initial results showed good safety and tolerability of miglustat in a population of CLN3 patients over 17 years of age  and a pharmacokinetic profile in line with expectations (see press release of 5 January 2023[2]).In conclusion  Craig Benson  Chair of the Beyond Batten Disease Foundation   said: ""We are absolutely delighted to have had such a constructive and productive meeting with the FDA enabling us to initiate the Phase III clinical trial for Batten-1 in the near future. Patients and their families are eagerly awaiting the launch of enrollment for this trial in a disease for which there is currently no available treatment. This trial is a source of tremendous hope for them.""About Batten-1Batten-1 is a novel and exclusive proprietary drug containing the active ingredient miglustat. The mechanism of action of this substance blocks the accumulation of glycosphingolipids and neuroinflammation. For patients over 17 years of age in the Phase I/II trial  the product is administered in solid form. In the Phase III trial  it will be administered in a liquid form better suited to pediatric patients.Phase I/II trial design: this is an open-label trial involving 6 patients over 17 years of age with CLN3 Batten disease  treated with miglustat up to 600 mg/day for a 2-year period. The primary endpoint is patient safety and tolerability  assessed using reports of adverse effects  biological tests and ECG  as well as the pharmacokinetics of miglustat. The secondary endpoints include efficacy monitoring: Unified Batten Disease Rating Scale  visual acuity  and brain MRI and optical coherence tomography scans. Administration of Batten-1 in escalating doses with a maximum of 600 mg/day was well tolerated  with no severe side effects observed causing treatment discontinuation. The most commonly reported adverse events are reversible gastrointestinal effects of often light to moderate severity  thus demonstrating the good tolerability profile of Batten-1 in this population. Batten-1 will continue to be assessed in these patients treated over a 24-month period. Further information about the trial is available on https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/showithNCT05174039 .About Batten diseaseJuvenile Batten disease  also known as Spielmeyer-Vogt or CLN3 disease  is a rare  fatal  inherited disorder of the nervous system for which there is no treatment or cure. Juvenile Batten disease belongs to a group of disorders referred to as neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs). Over 400 different errors in 13 genes have been attributed to various forms of NCL  which differ from one another primarily by when symptoms first appear. The first symptom in the juvenile form  progressive vision loss  appears between the ages of 4 and 6 which is followed by personality changes  behavioral problems  and slowed learning. Seizures commonly appear within 2-4 years of the onset of disease. Over time  patients continue to decline mentally and physically. Eventually  those affected become wheelchair-bound  are bedridden  and die prematurely. Psychiatric symptoms or psychosis can appear at any time.Juvenile Batten disease is always fatal; usually by the late teens to early 20s. In the United States and Europe  the juvenile form is the most common of the NCLs  which together  affect nearly 3 000 patients[3]. In pathophysiological terms  interactions between neurons and glial cells play key roles in the emergence and progression of all the NCLs.About Beyond Batten Disease FoundationBeyond Batten Disease Foundation (BBDF) is the world's largest nonprofit organization dedicated to funding research for a treatment and cure for juvenile (CLN3) Batten disease. Since its inception in 2008  over $35 million has been invested in research by leveraging donations  co-funding and strategic partnerships. BBDF is spearheading a unique  cohesive strategy  incorporating independent scientific resources and collaboration with related organizations to drive research in juvenile Batten Disease[4]. Today there is a treatment in sight. BBDF funded research has discovered a drug - Batten-1 - that slows the progression of the disease in Batten models.

May 9  2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Guerbet  a global leader in medical imaging with more than 30 years of experience in MRI  announced today that based on the most recent scientific and clinical evidence  the ACR Committee on Drugs and Contrast Media has classified Elucirem™ (gadopiclenol) as a Group II agent.6 This next generation GBCA from Guerbet  highly stable macrocyclic gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA)  has the highest relaxivity in its class for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and is indicated for use in adults and children aged 2 years and older.1 4 Elucirem™ requires only half the gadolinium dose of conventional non-specific GBCAs  addressing practitioners' concerns about gadolinium exposure.2 3""This new classification from the ACR is a real game changer for the future of Elucirem™ "" said Jared Houk  Commercial Vice President at Guerbet. ""This is an important moment for our team as it really shows the benefit of this product and its potential in the market.""The classification states that gadopiclenol ""demonstrates kinetic stability and a long dissociation half-life that are comparable to other Group II macrocyclic agents. Based on the most recent scientific and clinical evidence  the ACR Committee on Drugs and Contrast Media considers the risk of NSF among patients exposed to standard or lower than standard doses of Gadopiclenol is sufficiently low or possibly nonexistent such that it has been classified as a Group II agent.""6Elucirem™ (Gadopiclenol) injection is used to detect and visualize lesions with abnormal vascularity in the central nervous system (brain  spine  and associated tissues) and the body (head and neck  thorax  abdomen  pelvis  and musculoskeletal system).1 Guerbet received FDA approval of Elucirem™ (NDA 216986) on September 21  2022 after priority review  a designation assigned to applications for drugs that provide significant improvements in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment  diagnosis  or prevention of serious conditions compared to available therapies.5Story continuesGBCAs improve the contrast between lesions and surrounding tissues by accelerating the relaxation of protons thanks to interaction with gadolinium atoms. Gadopiclenol  the active drug substance of Elucirem™  has been designed to enable twice as much interaction  resulting in the highest relaxivity among all non-specific GBCAs.4 This allows use at half the conventional gadolinium dose to reveal high quality images.Elucirem is manufactured by Liebel-Flarsheim™ Company LLC  a Guerbet Group company  in Raleigh  North Carolina.About GuerbetAt Guerbet  we build lasting relationships so that we enable people to live better.

For patients at risk for chronically reduced renal function (for example  age >60 years  hypertension or diabetes)  estimate the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) through laboratory testing.Indications and UsageELUCIREM™ (gadopiclenol) injection is indicated in adult and pediatric patients aged 2 years and older for use with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to detect and visualize lesions with abnormal vascularity in the central nervous system (brain  spine  and associated tissues)  and the body (head and neck  thorax  abdomen  pelvis  and musculoskeletal system).ContraindicationsHistory of hypersensitivity reactions to ELUCIREMWarnings and PrecautionsNephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis: GBCAs increase the risk for NSF among patients with impaired elimination of the drugs. Avoid use of GBCAs among these patients unless the diagnostic information is essential and not available with non-contrast MRI or other modalities. The GBCA-associated NSF risk appears highest for patients with chronic  severe kidney disease as well as patients with acute kidney injury.Hypersensitivity Reactions: With GBCAs  serious hypersensitivity reactions have occurred. In most cases  initial symptoms occurred within minutes of GBCA administration and resolved with prompt emergency treatment. Before ELUCIREM administration  assess all patients for any history of a reaction to contrast media  bronchial asthma and/or allergic disorders. These patients may have an increased risk for a hypersensitivity reaction to ELUCIREM.Gadolinium Retention: Gadolinium is retained for months or years in several organs. Linear GBCAs cause more retention than macrocyclic GBCAs. Consequences of gadolinium retention in the brain have not been established. Pathologic and clinical consequences of GBCA administration and retention in skin and other organs have been established in patients with impaired renal function. While clinical consequences of gadolinium retention have not been established in patients with normal renal function  certain patients might be at higher risk. These include patients requiring multiple lifetime doses  pregnant and pediatric patients  and patients with inflammatory conditions. Consider the retention characteristics of the agent when choosing a GBCA for these patients. Minimize repetitive GBCA imaging studies  particularly closely spaced studies when possibleAcute Kidney Injury: In patients with chronically reduced renal function  acute kidney injury requiring dialysis has occurred with the use of GBCAs. The risk of acute kidney injury may increase with increasing dose of the contrast agent. Do not exceed the recommended dose.Extravasation and Injection Site Reactions: Injection site reactions such as injection site pain have been reported in the clinical studies with ELUCIREM. Extravasation during ELUCIREM administration may result in tissue irritation. Ensure catheter and venous patency before the injection of ELUCIREM.Interference with Visualization of Lesions Visible with Non-Contrast MRI: As with any GBCA  ELUCIREM may impair the visualization of lesions seen on non-contrast MRI. Therefore  caution should be exercised when Gadopiclenol MRI scans are interpreted without a companion non-contrast MRI scan.Adverse Reactions:In clinical trials  the most frequent adverse reactions that occurred in > 0.2% of patients who received ELUCIREM included: injection site pain  headache  nausea  injection site warmth  injection site coldness  dizziness  and localized swelling. Adverse reactions that occurred with a frequency ≤ 0.2% in patients who received 0.05 mmol/kg BWELUCIREM included: maculopapular rash  vomiting  worsened renal impairment  feeling hot  pyrexia  oral paresthesia  dysgeusia  diarrhea  pruritus  allergic dermatitis  erythema  injection site paresthesia  Cystatin C increase  and blood creatinine increase.Use in Specific PopulationsPregnancy: GBCAs cross the human placenta and result in fetal exposure and gadolinium retention. There are no available data on ELUCIREM use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects  miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes.Lactation: There are no data on the presence of ELUCIREM in human milk  the effects on the breastfed infant  or the effects on milk production. However  published lactation data on other GBCAs indicate that 0.01 to 0.04% of the maternal gadolinium dose is excreted in breast milk.Pediatric Use: The safety and effectiveness of ELUCIREM have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 2 years of age.Geriatric Use: This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney  and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function.Renal Impairment: In patients with renal impairment  the exposure of gadopiclenol is increased compared to patients with normal renal function. This may increase the risk of adverse reactions such as nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF). Avoid use of GBCAs among these patients unless the diagnostic information is essential and not available with non-contrast MRI or other modalities. No dose adjustment of ELUCIREM is recommended for patients with renal impairment. ELUCIREM can be removed from the body by hemodialysisYou are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA.

Indeed  once the Response to a NOD is screened and found acceptable for scientific review  a new review period begins immediately.Under the NOC/c policy  Health Canada has a target of 200 calendar days maximum to review the application.As a reminder  Health Canada issued in December 2022 a notice of deficiency (NOD) for the New Drug Submission of masitinib in the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  meaning that Health Canada requested the provision of additional information. AB Science submitted its revised application in April 2023  which has now been found acceptable for scientific review.The application includes new analysis  recently presented at the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) 2023 Annual Meeting in Boston  performed in ALS patients prior to any complete loss of physical function (corresponding to a score of 0 on any ALSFRS-R individual component and regardless of baseline progression rate and accounting for about 80% of the overall AB10015 study population)  showing a statistically significant 18.4% relative benefit on the CAFS endpoint in favor of masitinib 4.5 mg/kg/day as compared with control (p=0.035). The composite endpoint of functioning and survival (CAFS) is recommended by FDA and Health Canada as a primary endpoint to evaluate efficacy in ALS trials.Alain Moussy  co-founder and CEO of AB Science  said: “There is an urgent need expressed by ALS patients and their families in Canada to access masitinib treatment under NOC/c status and we will continue to work diligently with Health Canada to respond to this need.”An estimated 3 000 Canadians are currently living with ALS. Each year approximately 1 000 Canadians die from ALS. A similar number of Canadians are diagnosed with ALS each year.About AB ScienceFounded in 2001  AB Science is a pharmaceutical company specializing in the research  development and commercialization of protein kinase inhibitors (PKIs)  a class of targeted proteins whose action are key in signaling pathways within cells.

We are now progressing through the preparation steps for this merger  and  as our teams have started intensive interactions in that respect  we already see a remarkable match of our respective capabilities and prospects for fruitful synergies.”  said Gil Beyen  Chief Executive Officer of ERYTECH. “The Management and Board of ERYTECH are convinced that the strategic choice of combining with Pherecydes and creating a champion in AMR is of the best interest of ERYTECH and its stakeholders  and will be pleased to propose this ambitious strategic move for approval to the Company’s shareholders at the next General Assembly Meeting in June. For the sake of transparency  we inform the market that ERYTECH was recently contacted by a new shareholder  Akkadian Partners  who shared with us its opposition to ERYTECH’s merger project with the objective to conduct alternative acquisition projects through ERYTECH. After due consideration by Management and the Board of directors of ERYTECH  these alternative ideas were deemed not to be in the best interest of ERYTECH and its stakeholders and certainly not of sufficient robustness and value to distract the Company from its strategic direction.”Business HighlightsCombination with Pherecydes announced and merger process on track for proposed closing in JuneOn February 15  2023  the Company announced the strategic combination with Pherecydes  a biotechnology company specializing in precision phage therapy to treat resistant and/or complicated bacterial infections  with the ambition to create a global leader in extended phage therapy and accelerate the development of a portfolio of phage candidates targeting pathogenic bacteria. This transaction is the result of the extensive strategic review process announced by ERYTECH on several occasions since November 2021.The combination will draw on the complementary expertise and resources of the two companies to accelerate the development of a French phage therapy industry  aimed at combating antibiotic resistance  a globally recognized health issue  and at extending this technology to other therapeutic areas with significant unmet medical needs.ERYTECH and PHERECYDES intend to merge their operations and relocate all teams to ERYTECH’s premises in Lyon  where they will benefit from presence in a major European hub for infectious diseases.The proposed transaction is structured as a merger of PHERECYDES into ERYTECH  pursuant to which the shareholders of PHERECYDES would receive newly issued ERYTECH ordinary shares in consideration of the contribution of the assets and liabilities of PHERECYDES. The fairness of the exchange ratio will be reviewed by a court-appointed independent appraiser (commissaire à la fusion). His report will be made publicly available prior to the extraordinary shareholders meeting of ERYTECH and PHERECYDES  together with the required exemption document in relation to the merger in accordance with applicable laws.The extraordinary general meetings of ERYTECH and PHERECYDES shareholders will be called upon to vote on the proposed merger  currently expected to be convened on June 23  2023. The proposed transaction is expected to close shortly after the approval by the shareholders.This project is supported by the Boards of Directors and major shareholders of ERYTECH and PHERECYDES.Akkadian PartnersOn April 17  2023  Akkadian Partners  an entity domiciled in Luxembourg and acting on behalf of the Akkadian Partners Fund  declared that on April 13  2023  they crossed the threshold of 5% of the share capital of ERYTECH Pharma and held 5.06% of the share capital and 4.83% of the voting rights of the company.On May 1st  2023  Akkadian Partners informed the Board of ERYTECH that they intended to oppose the project of merging with Pherecydes and take de facto control of ERYTECH with a view to pursue alternative acquisition projects with ERYTECH's cash.In that context  the Management and Board of ERYTECH have reviewed and assessed the ideas of acquisitions projects mentioned by Akkadian  with the assistance of external financial and legal advisers. After due consideration  ERYTECH determined that these ideas  were not in the best interest of ERYTECH and its stakeholders  and remote from ERYTECH’s strategy and identity  with significant uncertainty and risks associated with these projects.It is worth noting that Akkadian indicated that they are committed to increase their stake in ERYTECH up to 15% of the share capital in the short term and around 25% in the mid-term (i.e.  below the 30% threshold triggering the obligation to file a mandatory tender offer on ERYTECH). Although Akkadian does not seem to intend to acquire a controlling stake in ERYTECH  it requested the appointment of 4 directors (and the resignation of 5 incumbent directors) which would represent the majority of ERYTECH's Board. Such attempt to gain de facto control of ERYTECH without filing a tender offer on ERYTECH and without offering liquidity to minority shareholders is hostile and will be strongly rejected. Note that ERYTECH is not aware of any further acquisitions of ERYTECH shares completed by Akkadian.ERYTECH  while confirming its strategic decision to merge with Pherecydes  will oppose any financial predation project which would not be in the best interest of the company and its stakeholders.Update on Q1 2023 Financial Results and Cash positionAs of March 31  2023  ERYTECH had cash and cash equivalents totaling €30.5 million (approximately $33.7 million)  compared with €38.8 million as of December 31  2022. The €8.3 million net decrease in cash position during the first quarter of 2023 was the result of a €7.5 million net cash utilization in operating activities and investing activities  including a one-off €1.2 million expense for restructuring and pre-merger activities  and €0.6 million used in financing activities  with the start of the scheduled repayment of the 2020  €10 million government-guaranteed ‘Covid-19’ loan.

We are now progressing through the preparation steps for this merger  and  as our teams have started intensive interactions in that respect  we already see a remarkable match of our respective capabilities and prospects for fruitful synergies.”  said Gil Beyen  Chief Executive Officer of ERYTECH. “The Management and Board of ERYTECH are convinced that the strategic choice of combining with Pherecydes and creating a champion in AMR is of the best interest of ERYTECH and its stakeholders  and will be pleased to propose this ambitious strategic move for approval to the Company’s shareholders at the next General Assembly Meeting in June. For the sake of transparency  we inform the market that ERYTECH was recently contacted by a new shareholder  Akkadian Partners  who shared with us its opposition to ERYTECH’s merger project with the objective to conduct alternative acquisition projects through ERYTECH. After due consideration by Management and the Board of directors of ERYTECH  these alternative ideas were deemed not to be in the best interest of ERYTECH and its stakeholders and certainly not of sufficient robustness and value to distract the Company from its strategic direction.”Business HighlightsCombination with Pherecydes announced and merger process on track for proposed closing in JuneOn February 15  2023  the Company announced the strategic combination with Pherecydes  a biotechnology company specializing in precision phage therapy to treat resistant and/or complicated bacterial infections  with the ambition to create a global leader in extended phage therapy and accelerate the development of a portfolio of phage candidates targeting pathogenic bacteria. This transaction is the result of the extensive strategic review process announced by ERYTECH on several occasions since November 2021.The combination will draw on the complementary expertise and resources of the two companies to accelerate the development of a French phage therapy industry  aimed at combating antibiotic resistance  a globally recognized health issue  and at extending this technology to other therapeutic areas with significant unmet medical needs.ERYTECH and PHERECYDES intend to merge their operations and relocate all teams to ERYTECH’s premises in Lyon  where they will benefit from presence in a major European hub for infectious diseases.The proposed transaction is structured as a merger of PHERECYDES into ERYTECH  pursuant to which the shareholders of PHERECYDES would receive newly issued ERYTECH ordinary shares in consideration of the contribution of the assets and liabilities of PHERECYDES. The fairness of the exchange ratio will be reviewed by a court-appointed independent appraiser (commissaire à la fusion). His report will be made publicly available prior to the extraordinary shareholders meeting of ERYTECH and PHERECYDES  together with the required exemption document in relation to the merger in accordance with applicable laws.The extraordinary general meetings of ERYTECH and PHERECYDES shareholders will be called upon to vote on the proposed merger  currently expected to be convened on June 23  2023. The proposed transaction is expected to close shortly after the approval by the shareholders.This project is supported by the Boards of Directors and major shareholders of ERYTECH and PHERECYDES.Akkadian PartnersOn April 17  2023  Akkadian Partners  an entity domiciled in Luxembourg and acting on behalf of the Akkadian Partners Fund  declared that on April 13  2023  they crossed the threshold of 5% of the share capital of ERYTECH Pharma and held 5.06% of the share capital and 4.83% of the voting rights of the company.On May 1st  2023  Akkadian Partners informed the Board of ERYTECH that they intended to oppose the project of merging with Pherecydes and take de facto control of ERYTECH with a view to pursue alternative acquisition projects with ERYTECH's cash.In that context  the Management and Board of ERYTECH have reviewed and assessed the ideas of acquisitions projects mentioned by Akkadian  with the assistance of external financial and legal advisers. After due consideration  ERYTECH determined that these ideas  were not in the best interest of ERYTECH and its stakeholders  and remote from ERYTECH’s strategy and identity  with significant uncertainty and risks associated with these projects.It is worth noting that Akkadian indicated that they are committed to increase their stake in ERYTECH up to 15% of the share capital in the short term and around 25% in the mid-term (i.e.  below the 30% threshold triggering the obligation to file a mandatory tender offer on ERYTECH). Although Akkadian does not seem to intend to acquire a controlling stake in ERYTECH  it requested the appointment of 4 directors (and the resignation of 5 incumbent directors) which would represent the majority of ERYTECH's Board. Such attempt to gain de facto control of ERYTECH without filing a tender offer on ERYTECH and without offering liquidity to minority shareholders is hostile and will be strongly rejected. Note that ERYTECH is not aware of any further acquisitions of ERYTECH shares completed by Akkadian.ERYTECH  while confirming its strategic decision to merge with Pherecydes  will oppose any financial predation project which would not be in the best interest of the company and its stakeholders.Update on Q1 2023 Financial Results and Cash positionAs of March 31  2023  ERYTECH had cash and cash equivalents totaling €30.5 million (approximately $33.7 million)  compared with €38.8 million as of December 31  2022.

ColoNode® will be distributed as a manual kit by Biocartis to expert laboratories in selected European countries.CRC is the third most common cancer type in the world with an estimated 1.9 million new cases and 0.9 million deaths per year worldwide1. 70-90% of CRC patients may undergo surgical resection of the tumor. International guidelines2 have introduced the tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging system  that assesses primary tumor (T)  lymph node metastasis (N)  and distant metastasis (M) to predict disease recurrence and survival. As a key component in this staging system  lymph nodes that are contained in the resected section of the colon  are inspected for presence of disseminated tumor cells. Lymph node status is also a key factor in deciding on post-operative adjuvant chemotherapy. The routine method of determining lymph node status (pN) is microscopic examination of H&E3 stained lymph node tissue sections  that has limitations: it is insensitive and subjective  requires specially trained pathologists  examines < 1% of the lymph node volume and cannot differentiate between aggressive and relatively harmless tumor cells.ColoNode® is a CE-marked IVD gene expression test that detects and characterizes tumor cells in post-operative CRC lymph node samples. The ColoNode® kit can analyze up to 100% of the lymph node volume and is more sensitive in detecting tumor cells than H&E staining. Additionally  the test provides an estimation of the risk of CRC recurrence based on the tumor aggressiveness markers included in the ColoNode® kit4.The partnership will initially focus on the commercialization of the ColoNode® CE-marked IVD manual kit in selected European countries by Biocartis. Following commercial uptake of the manual kit  HiloProbe and Biocartis will consider developing a fully automated version of the test on Biocartis’ decentralized Idylla™ platform.Roger Moody  Chief Executive Officer of Biocartis  commented: “We are pleased to partner with HiloProbe on the distribution of the ColoNode® kit. This allows us to broaden our product offering to customers in the colorectal cancer domain  complementing tests for RAS biomarkers and MSI on our Idylla™ platform. The collaboration supports our mission to maximize patient access to precision medicine in oncology.”Lina Olsson  Chief Executive Officer of HiloProbe  added: “We are very happy to start a collaboration and a long-term relationship with Biocartis  which strengthens our focus on colorectal cancer thanks to Biocartis’ established sales and distribution network across many countries. Further development of a fully automated version of ColoNode® on the Idylla™ platform also holds great potential for ColoNode® to contribute faster and more easily to the safer selection of patients who could benefit from postoperative adjuvant treatment.”----- END ----More information:Renate DegraveHead of Corporate Communications & Investor Relations Biocartise-mail rdegrave@biocartis.comtel +32 15 631 729mobile +32 471 53 60 64About BiocartisWith its revolutionary and proprietary Idylla™ platform  Biocartis (Euronext Brussels: BCART) aspires to enable personalized medicine for patients around the world through universal access to molecular testing  by making molecular testing actionable  convenient  fast and suitable for any lab.

The founders consist of a group of scientists  who have collaborated for more than 15 years in an academic setting and have produced high quality original research focusing on the development of clinically useful biomarkers in colorectal cancer. The research has been focused on analysis of the regional lymph nodes in the resected specimen. The reason is that the lymph node is the first site where metastasizing cancer cells will occur. We have now discovered a limited number of biomarkers that  when analyzed together  identify tumor cells in the lymph node and grade tumor cell aggressiveness i.e. their propensity to metastasize to distant sites. A product (ColoNode®)  based on biomarker mRNA analysis  has been developed. The aim is to bring ColoNode® to the market to save people´s lives and aid in the development of more efficient treatment of colorectal cancer.Biocartis and Idylla™ are registered trademarks in Europe  the United States and other countries.

ColoNode® will be distributed as a manual kit by Biocartis to expert laboratories in selected European countries.CRC is the third most common cancer type in the world with an estimated 1.9 million new cases and 0.9 million deaths per year worldwide1. 70-90% of CRC patients may undergo surgical resection of the tumor. International guidelines2 have introduced the tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging system  that assesses primary tumor (T)  lymph node metastasis (N)  and distant metastasis (M) to predict disease recurrence and survival. As a key component in this staging system  lymph nodes that are contained in the resected section of the colon  are inspected for presence of disseminated tumor cells. Lymph node status is also a key factor in deciding on post-operative adjuvant chemotherapy. The routine method of determining lymph node status (pN) is microscopic examination of H&E3 stained lymph node tissue sections  that has limitations: it is insensitive and subjective  requires specially trained pathologists  examines < 1% of the lymph node volume and cannot differentiate between aggressive and relatively harmless tumor cells.ColoNode® is a CE-marked IVD gene expression test that detects and characterizes tumor cells in post-operative CRC lymph node samples. The ColoNode® kit can analyze up to 100% of the lymph node volume and is more sensitive in detecting tumor cells than H&E staining. Additionally  the test provides an estimation of the risk of CRC recurrence based on the tumor aggressiveness markers included in the ColoNode® kit4.The partnership will initially focus on the commercialization of the ColoNode® CE-marked IVD manual kit in selected European countries by Biocartis. Following commercial uptake of the manual kit  HiloProbe and Biocartis will consider developing a fully automated version of the test on Biocartis’ decentralized Idylla™ platform.Roger Moody  Chief Executive Officer of Biocartis  commented: “We are pleased to partner with HiloProbe on the distribution of the ColoNode® kit. This allows us to broaden our product offering to customers in the colorectal cancer domain  complementing tests for RAS biomarkers and MSI on our Idylla™ platform. The collaboration supports our mission to maximize patient access to precision medicine in oncology.”Lina Olsson  Chief Executive Officer of HiloProbe  added: “We are very happy to start a collaboration and a long-term relationship with Biocartis  which strengthens our focus on colorectal cancer thanks to Biocartis’ established sales and distribution network across many countries. Further development of a fully automated version of ColoNode® on the Idylla™ platform also holds great potential for ColoNode® to contribute faster and more easily to the safer selection of patients who could benefit from postoperative adjuvant treatment.”----- END ----More information:Renate DegraveHead of Corporate Communications & Investor Relations Biocartise-mail rdegrave@biocartis.comtel +32 15 631 729mobile +32 471 53 60 64About BiocartisWith its revolutionary and proprietary Idylla™ platform  Biocartis (Euronext Brussels: BCART) aspires to enable personalized medicine for patients around the world through universal access to molecular testing  by making molecular testing actionable  convenient  fast and suitable for any lab.

The founders consist of a group of scientists  who have collaborated for more than 15 years in an academic setting and have produced high quality original research focusing on the development of clinically useful biomarkers in colorectal cancer. The research has been focused on analysis of the regional lymph nodes in the resected specimen. The reason is that the lymph node is the first site where metastasizing cancer cells will occur. We have now discovered a limited number of biomarkers that  when analyzed together  identify tumor cells in the lymph node and grade tumor cell aggressiveness i.e. their propensity to metastasize to distant sites. A product (ColoNode®)  based on biomarker mRNA analysis  has been developed. The aim is to bring ColoNode® to the market to save people´s lives and aid in the development of more efficient treatment of colorectal cancer.Biocartis and Idylla™ are registered trademarks in Europe  the United States and other countries.

Here  data plays a key role because it can help better calculate secured lending risk exposure ” Konstance argues.The specific steps an institution takes to proactively mitigate risks vary depending on the institution  and with banks relative in size to Silicon Valley Bank (SVB)  Signature Bank and  most recently  First Republic Bank  a critical component is having built a robust internal balance sheet management system to identify critical gaps on their balance sheet.“Banks should be able to run simulations that  in times of uncertainty  will enable them to apply a holistic risk management framework  which will assist the bank when a crisis appears. While supporting business as usual  they will have the ability to recognize and act quickly when an event occurs ” notes Jeroen Van Doorsselaere  Vice President of Global Product & Platform Management  Wolters Kluwer Finance  Risk & Regulatory Reporting (FRR). “In an everchanging and dynamic regulatory landscape  the ability to use regulatory metrics further constrains the internal risk management system and ensures regulatory compliance at all times while optimizing it from a risk perspective.”Early signs of trouble may emanate from financial news stories or social media  news about a delay in a bank’s financial reports  branch closings  or reports that a bank might be acquired or sold. Wolters Kluwer Legal & Regulatory U.S. has prepared a Due Diligence Checklist that sets out what to look for and ask about when conducting one’s own assessment of the health of a financial institution. The Checklist identifies proactive steps to gauge how sound a bank is  and whether it is stable enough to merit one initiating or continuing business with that institution.Once a bank shows signs of trouble  an assertive and prompt response from government  regulators and industry peers can go a long way in mitigating the losses experienced by a bank and its depositors. The quick and decisive actions in response to the SVB and Signature Bank failures helped minimize the impacts to depositors and restore confidence in the U.S. banking system  says Tim Burniston  Senior Advisor  Regulatory Strategy  for Wolters Kluwer Compliance Solutions. “What we can point to in the early days of these developments is that regulators and major banks are collectively working to stem further losses and instill confidence.” Burniston expects to see “more positive measures by regulators and the industry to address and calm the current turbulence in the industry.”More insights are available at Bank Failures in the News: Why Compliance and Risk Management are Crucial.About Wolters KluwerWolters Kluwer (EURONEXT: WKL) is a global leader in information  software  and services for professionals in healthcare  tax and accounting  financial and corporate compliance  legal and regulatory  and corporate performance and ESG.

Margins in the European nitrogen segment were also impacted by high-cost inventories produced in Q4 2022 and sold in Q1 2023 following a sharp drop in gas prices  and restart delays post Q4 2022 turnarounds. The combined impact was $74 million during the quarter.OCI Global (Euronext: OCI)  a global producer and distributor of hydrogen products providing fertilizers  fuels  and feedstock to agricultural  transportation  and industrial customers around the world  today reported first quarter 2023 revenues of $1.4 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $336 million  reflecting lower selling prices  a decline in own-produced volumes of 12% compared to a year ago  and realized gas hedging losses of $98 million.OCI and Petrofac have entered into a strategic partnership where Petrofac will be OCI's exclusive global engineering partner forOCI has signed an agreement with NuStar that allows OCI toOCI has recently launched a cost optimization initiative to reinforce its first quartile positioning on the global cost curve  with a target to be announced in August 2023; Fertiglobe has already identified aNet debt declined by 9% to $1.06 billion as of 31 March 2023  or consolidated net leverage of 0.3xResults reflect $98 million realized losses from natural gas hedges and an estimated $77 million impact on adjusted EBITDA from unplanned outages in TexasQ1 2023 revenues decreased 41% to $1.4 billion  adjusted EBITDA decreased 65% to $336 million YoY  mainly due to significantly lower selling prices and volumes  and realized gas hedging losses  partly offset by lower gas pricesQ1 2023 Results ReportIn the methanol segment  unplanned outages had an estimated negative impact of $77 million on adjusted EBITDA  of which c.$30 million due to the winter freeze in the US. Following the restart  the plants in Texas have been running well.We reduced net debt and maintained consolidated net leverage at 0.3x as of 31 March 2023. In April  OCI returned $800 million to shareholders and Fertiglobe distributed $700 million of dividends  of which $350 million to OCI  with respect to the period H2 2022. Guidance on the return of capital to shareholders with respect to H1 2023 will be provided with the Q2 2023 results.Ahmed El-Hoshy  CEO of OCI Global commented:""Our Q1 results were affected by challenging market conditions  but underlying fundamentals remain healthy for our existing nitrogen and methanol businesses. European gas futures over next winter and 2024 are pricing in expectations of a tighter market than current levels  implying ammonia cost support of ~$815/t including CO2 and $650/t excluding CO2. This should result in closures of European marginal production if pricing remains below cost for a sustained period.I am also pleased about a growing diversified customer base from both existing traditional and new applications for our low carbon ammonia and methanol businesses as we started delivering low carbon fertilizers to several food & beverages customers  and expect demand for green methanol to power new methanol-powered container ships.Our hydrogen growth initiatives are progressing well  reinforcing our role as a leader in the global energy transition. We are already the largest green methanol producer in the world and are establishing a comprehensive low carbon platform by decarbonizing our existing platform and executing new projects. We are well ahead of our peers  with the first large-scale blue ammonia project set to start production in the US in early 2025.We have been receptive to comments made by shareholders  including Inclusive Capital  regarding the significant share price discount to OCI's intrinsic value  despite strong incumbent positions in our markets and the tangible steps we are taking in executing on our hydrogen strategy. In this regard  we have started a comprehensive review of all our business lines with the aim to unlock value  including an evaluation of our listing in the Netherlands.We also reiterate our commitment to our operational excellence program  which is on track to deliver operational and EBITDA efficiencies. In addition  we recently launched an initiative to further optimize OCI's and Fertiglobe's cost structures and reinforce our top quartile cash cost positioning. Fertiglobe has already identified a run-rate of at least $50 million per annum savings to be achieved over the next 12 - 18 months.""Progress on hydrogen fuels initiativesGreen methanol: OCI is already the largest green methanol producer in the world  and is evaluating an innovative gasification project at our Dutch facilities:Gasification units to convert municipal solid waste and wood waste to produce green syngas One line at BioMCN to produce a mix of ~450 ktpa of bio-methanol e-methanol  and RCF methanol EU Innovation Fund application was submitted in March 2023 and discussions with the Dutch government through the Tailor-Made Agreement process for additional support are on-goingBlue / low carbon ammonia: in addition to OCI's existing blue and low carbon ammonia business  we have several new projects to expand capacity including:2",neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.46,0.2,0.34,True,English,"['Q1 2023 results report', 'OCI N', 'RCF methanol EU Innovation Fund application', 'lower gas prices Q1 2023 Results Report', 'top quartile cash cost positioning', 'first large-scale blue ammonia project', 'growing diversified customer base', 'significant share price discount', 'green syngas One line', 'exclusive global engineering partner', 'new methanol-powered container ships', 'largest green methanol producer', 'comprehensive low carbon platform', 'first quartile positioning', 'low carbon ammonia', 'innovative gasification project', 'gas hedging losses', 'natural gas hedges', 'European gas futures', 'lower selling prices', 'strong incumbent positions', 'ammonia cost support', 'global energy transition', 'global cost curve', '$98 million realized losses', 'challenging market conditions', 'hydrogen growth initiatives', 'next 12 - 18 months', 'municipal solid waste', 'first quarter 2023 revenues', 'low carbon fertilizers', 'European nitrogen segment', 'European marginal production', 'operational excellence program', 'Tailor-Made Agreement process', 'cost optimization initiative', 'hydrogen fuels initiatives', 'global producer', 'methanol segment', 'Q1 results', 'Q1 2023 revenues', 'methanol businesses', 'existing platform', 'comprehensive review', 'cost structures', 'Q2 2023 results', 'new applications', 'new projects', 'existing blue', 'hydrogen products', '$77 million impact', 'existing nitrogen', 'next winter', 'tighter market', 'hydrogen strategy', 'Gasification units', 'wood waste', 'additional support', 'high-cost inventories', 'sharp drop', 'combined impact', 'agricultural, transportation', 'industrial customers', 'strategic partnership', 'Net debt', 'net leverage', 'unplanned outages', 'negative impact', 'winter freeze', 'Ahmed El-Hoshy', 'underlying fundamentals', 'current levels', 'existing traditional', 'several food', 'beverages customers', 'tangible steps', 'business lines', 'annum savings', 'Dutch facilities', 'Dutch government', 'OCI Global', 'produced volumes', 'Q4 2022 turnarounds', 'sustained period', 'intrinsic value', 'EBITDA efficiencies', 'Margins', 'restart', 'delays', 'Euronext', 'distributor', 'feedstock', 'world', 'decline', 'Petrofac', 'NuStar', 'target', 'August', 'Fertiglobe', '31 March', 'Texas', 'plants', 'April', 'shareholders', 'dividends', 'respect', 'H2', 'Guidance', 'return', 'capital', 'H1', 'CEO', 'expectations', 'CO2', 'pricing', 'demand', 'role', 'leader', 'peers', 'comments', 'markets', 'regard', 'aim', 'evaluation', 'listing', 'Netherlands', 'commitment', 'track', 'run-rate', 'Progress', 'BioMCN', 'mix', '~450 ktpa', 'bio-methanol', 'discussions', '0.']",2023-05-09,2023-05-10,marketscreener.com

Its valuable guidance allows us to get fully prepared for the trial launch "" explained Theranexus' Chief Medical Officer Marie Sebille.""We would like to thank the FDA for its support  which is fundamental to the development of our Batten-1 drug candidate  the only asset in active clinical development for Batten disease (CLN3). Our pivotal Phase III trial will enable us to gain approval for Batten-1  and also deliver rich news flow throughout the duration of the Phase III trial thanks to the parallel open-label patient cohort. More generally  we have no doubt that we can deliver a therapeutic response for patients suffering from Batten disease "" added Theranexus' CEO Mathieu Charvériat.Theranexus and BBDF worked with the FDA's DRDMG to define the following criteria for the protocol of the Phase III multicenter trial for evaluating Batten-1 in patients with juvenile Batten disease (CLN3):The trial will be a randomized  double-blind study conducted versus placebo in 2 parallel groups to assess the efficacy of Batten-1 at a dose of 15 mg/kg and up to 600 mg/day for a 2-year treatment period The target population will be a pediatric cohort involving approximately 60 patients aged 4 to 16 years  with randomization stratified into 3 age groups of 4 to 8 years  9 to 12 years and 13 to 16 years to achieve suitable representation for all age groups assessed The primary endpoint will be visual acuity  measured using either the quantitative LogMAR[1] scale  or a qualitative scale in the most impaired patients for whom quantitative assessment is not possible The secondary endpoints will include cognitive function  assessed by the Verbal Comprehension Index from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children according to age  motor function assessed by a selection of motor items from the Unified Batten Disease Rating Scale (UBDRS)  and visual function  assessed by OCT scan An assessment of functional ability in everyday activities and a Quality-of-Life measurement will also be performed.An additional open-label cohort of 9 patients' representative of the different age groups of the target population will be enrolled in parallel. This will allow us to enrich the statistical analysis plan  in particular in comparison with natural history data  for the primary and secondary endpoints on trial completion  and produce interim results every 6 months  including measurements of biomarkers (notably glycosphingolipids given their toxic accumulation resulting in neuronal death) and efficacy data on the same criteria as the main 60-patient cohort.Patient enrollment should begin in the end of 2023. The trial will run in parallel in several centers throughout the United States and Europe. Provided positive results are registered  the FDA confirms that a sole Phase III trial as defined above would secure approval of the Batten-1 candidate in Batten disease. The company's goal is to use the results of this trial to win product approval in both the United States and Europe.As a reminder  the Phase III trial follows on from Phase I/II whose initial results showed good safety and tolerability of miglustat in a population of CLN3 patients over 17 years of age  and a pharmacokinetic profile in line with expectations (see press release of 5 January 2023[2]).In conclusion  Craig Benson  Chair of the Beyond Batten Disease Foundation  said: ""We are absolutely delighted to have had such a constructive and productive meeting with the FDA enabling us to initiate the Phase III clinical trial for Batten-1 in the near future. Patients and their families are eagerly awaiting the launch of enrollment for this trial in a disease for which there is currently no available treatment. This trial is a source of tremendous hope for them.""About Batten-1Batten-1 is a novel and exclusive proprietary drug containing the active ingredient miglustat. The mechanism of action of this substance blocks the accumulation of glycosphingolipids and neuroinflammation. For patients over 17 years of age in the Phase I/II trial  the product is administered in solid form. In the Phase III trial  it will be administered in a liquid form better suited to pediatric patients.Phase I/II trial design: this is an open-label trial involving 6 patients over 17 years of age with CLN3 Batten disease  treated with miglustat up to 600 mg/day for a 2-year period. The primary endpoint is patient safety and tolerability  assessed using reports of adverse effects  biological tests and ECG  as well as the pharmacokinetics of miglustat. The secondary endpoints include efficacy monitoring: Unified Batten Disease Rating Scale  visual acuity  and brain MRI and optical coherence tomography scans. Administration of Batten-1 in escalating doses with a maximum of 600 mg/day was well tolerated  with no severe side effects observed causing treatment discontinuation. The most commonly reported adverse events are reversible gastrointestinal effects of often light to moderate severity  thus demonstrating the good tolerability profile of Batten-1 in this population. Batten-1 will continue to be assessed in these patients treated over a 24-month period. Further information about the trial is available on https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/showithNCT05174039.About Batten diseaseJuvenile Batten disease  also known as Spielmeyer-Vogt or CLN3 disease  is a rare  fatal  inherited disorder of the nervous system for which there is no treatment or cure. Juvenile Batten disease belongs to a group of disorders referred to as neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs). Over 400 different errors in 13 genes have been attributed to various forms of NCL  which differ from one another primarily by when symptoms first appear. The first symptom in the juvenile form  progressive vision loss  appears between the ages of 4 and 6 which is followed by personality changes  behavioral problems  and slowed learning. Seizures commonly appear within 2-4 years of the onset of disease. Over time  patients continue to decline mentally and physically. Eventually  those affected become wheelchair-bound  are bedridden  and die prematurely. Psychiatric symptoms or psychosis can appear at any time.Juvenile Batten disease is always fatal; usually by the late teens to early 20s. In the United States and Europe  the juvenile form is the most common of the NCLs  which together  affect nearly 3 000 patients[3]. In pathophysiological terms  interactions between neurons and glial cells play key roles in the emergence and progression of all the NCLs.About Beyond Batten Disease FoundationBeyond Batten Disease Foundation (BBDF) is the world's largest nonprofit organization dedicated to funding research for a treatment and cure for juvenile (CLN3) Batten disease. Since its inception in 2008  over $35 million has been invested in research by leveraging donations  co-funding and strategic partnerships. BBDF is spearheading a unique  cohesive strategy  incorporating independent scientific resources and collaboration with related organizations to drive research in juvenile Batten Disease[4]. Today there is a treatment in sight. BBDF funded research has discovered a drug – Batten-1 – that slows the progression of the disease in Batten models.

Completion is expected in early 2024OCI and Petrofac have entered into a strategic partnership where Petrofac will be OCI's exclusive global engineering partner for gasification-based hydrogen fuels projectsOCI Global (Euronext: OCI)  a global producer and distributor of hydrogen products providing fertilizers  fuels  and feedstock to agricultural  transportation  and industrial customers around the world  today reported first quarter 2023 revenues of $1.4 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $336 million  reflecting lower selling prices  a decline in own-produced volumes of 12% compared to a year ago  and realized gas hedging losses of $98 million.In particular  own-produced volumes in Europe were 46% lower YoY. Margins in the European nitrogen segment were also impacted by high-cost inventories produced in Q4 2022 and sold in Q1 2023 following a sharp drop in gas prices  and restart delays post Q4 2022 turnarounds. The combined impact was $74 million during the quarter.In the methanol segment  unplanned outages had an estimated negative impact of $77 million on adjusted EBITDA  of which c.$30 million due to the winter freeze in the US. Following the restart  the plants in Texas have been running well.We reduced net debt and maintained consolidated net leverage at 0.3x as of 31 March 2023. In April  OCI returned $800 million to shareholders and Fertiglobe distributed $700 million of dividends  of which $350 million to OCI  with respect to the period H2 2022. Guidance on the return of capital to shareholders with respect to H1 2023 will be provided with the Q2 2023 results.Ahmed El-Hoshy  CEO of OCI Global commented:""Our Q1 results were affected by challenging market conditions  but underlying fundamentals remain healthy for our existing nitrogen and methanol businesses. European gas futures over next winter and 2024 are pricing in expectations of a tighter market than current levels  implying ammonia cost support of ~$815/t including CO 2 and $650/t excluding CO 2 . This should result in closures of European marginal production if pricing remains below cost for a sustained period.I am also pleased about a growing diversified customer base from both existing traditional and new applications for our low carbon ammonia and methanol businesses as we started delivering low carbon fertilizers to several food & beverages customers  and expect demand for green methanol to power new methanol-powered container ships.Our hydrogen growth initiatives are progressing well  reinforcing our role as a leader in the global energy transition. We are already the largest green methanol producer in the world and are establishing a comprehensive low carbon platform by decarbonizing our existing platform and executing new projects. We are well ahead of our peers  with the first large-scale blue ammonia project set to start production in the US in early 2025.We have been receptive to comments made by shareholders  including Inclusive Capital  regarding the significant share price discount to OCI's intrinsic value  despite strong incumbent positions in our markets and the tangible steps we are taking in executing on our hydrogen strategy. In this regard  we have started a comprehensive review of all our business lines with the aim to unlock value  including an evaluation of our listing in the Netherlands.We also reiterate our commitment to our operational excellence program  which is on track to deliver operational and EBITDA efficiencies. In addition  we recently launched an initiative to further optimize OCI's and Fertiglobe's cost structures and reinforce our top quartile cash cost positioning. Fertiglobe has already identified a run-rate of at least $50 million per annum savings to be achieved over the next 12 - 18 months.""Progress on hydrogen fuels initiativesGreen methanol : OCI is already the largest green methanol producer in the world  and is evaluating an innovative gasification project at our Dutch facilities: Gasification units to convert municipal solid waste and wood waste to produce green syngas One line at BioMCN to produce a mix of ~450 ktpa of bio-methanol  e-methanol  and RCF methanol EU Innovation Fund application was submitted in March 2023 and discussions with the Dutch government through the Tailor-Made Agreement process for additional support are on-going: OCI is already the largest green methanol producer in the world  and is evaluating an innovative gasification project at our Dutch facilities:Blue / low carbon ammonia : in addition to OCI's existing blue and low carbon ammonia business  we have several new projects to expand capacity including: Texas Blue Ammonia : the 1.1 mtpa project is on track to start production in early 2025. Linde (NYSE: LIN) recently announced that it has signed a long-term agreement with ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) for the offtake and sequestration of CO 2 generated by the project. The feedstock supply agreement contains provisions for the IRA benefit to be shared between OCI and Linde: in addition to OCI's existing blue and low carbon ammonia business  we have several new projects to expand capacity including:Renewable ammonia : we are already producing in Egypt (green ammonia) and the US (bio-ammonia): First on-spec green ammonia produced by Egypt Green Hydrogen during Q1  ramping up in 2023 Further potential to scale up  including in the US transitioning from blue to green  leveraging green hydrogen tax credits alongside the development of scalable technology: we are already producing in Egypt (green ammonia) and the US (bio-ammonia):We are expanding our Rotterdam ammonia import terminal to 1.2 million tons throughput capacity by Q1 2024In addition  the business benefits from OCI's global methanol and ammonia infrastructure and logistics including storage  leased ships and railcars  and inland barges.Market outlookOCI believes the outlook for nitrogen markets continues to be supported by crop fundamentals and tight supply dynamics in the medium termNitrogen demand is expected to recover to support rebuilding of global grain stocks: Global grain stock-to-use ratios remain at the lowest levels in 20 years  and it will likely take at least until 2025 to replenish stocks Forward grain prices (US corn futures >$5 / bushel to the end of 2025  compared to $3.7 / bushel from 2015 - 2019) support farm incomes and incentivize nitrogen demand to be above historical trend levels The recent decline in nitrogen pricing is supportive of improving affordability and demandNitrogen supply is expected to be tighter over 2023 - 2027 : In 2022  six million tons of new urea capacity commissioned  with some plants ramping up in 2023. Industry consultants expect no new major greenfield urea supply in 2023 and limited additions to 2027 Chinese urea exports are expected to remain low over the medium term in the range of 3 - 4 mtpa:Feedstock pricing is expected to remain well above historical averages : 2023 - 2025 forward European gas prices are c.$16/mmBtu (c.3x higher than 2015-2019)  with higher prices anticipated for next winter The gas forwards imply marginal cost support levels for ammonia of ~$815/t including CO 2   and $650/t excluding CO 2 for next winter and 2024  which should result in closures of European marginal production if pricing remains below cost for a sustained period:OCI believes the methanol outlook is positive on higher oil prices  rebound in China  new marine fuel demand and limited supplyMethanol demand is expected to recover during the second half of 2023 on the back of China re-opening  which combined with higher oil prices and improved methanol affordability should support higher methanol-to-olefins (MTO) operating rates which have been low.There is potential meaningful upside from demand for hydrogen fuels  notably as a cleaner alternative for road and marine fuel applications: The first methanol-fueled container ships are being delivered starting this year Incremental demand from the maritime sector is expected to be more than 4 mtpa by the mid-2020's based on current orders from the container vessel segment aloneThere are limited new methanol greenfield supply additions in the near/medium term  and we continue to expect tighter methanol market fundamentals over the period 2023 through 2027OCI Global will publish Q1 2023 results on Tuesday 9 May 2023 before market open.A conference call for investors and analysts will be hosted on Tuesday  9 May 2023 at 4:00 PM CET (3:00 PM GMT  10:00 AM ET) by Ahmed El-Hoshy  Chief Executive Officer and Hassan Badrawi  Chief Financial Officer.Investors can access the call and ask live questions by dialing one of the following numbers using the code 001024UK Dial-in: +44 20 3936 2999USA Dial-in: +1 646 664 1960Netherlands Dial-in: +31 85 888 7233UAE Dial-in: +971 800 0357 04553All other locations: +44 20 3936 2999Global Dial-In NumbersParticipants may also join via the webcast.

The app allows travellers to link up with others visiting the same destinations and organise meet-ups as well as offering hostels the opportunity to showcase their events.Shares on the Euronext Dublin stock market were up more than 8pc by lunchtime as the company held its annual general meeting (AGM).Ahead of the shareholder meeting  chairman Michael Cawley issued a a strongly upbeat trading update.“As a result of this strong performance and in the absence of any deterioration in the macro-economic environment  the reintroduction of Covid restrictions or air travel disruptions  we expect bookings and revenue to grow by 30pc over 2022 and our adjusted Ebitda to be in the range of €16.5m to €17m for the full year ” he said.Bookings to many of HostelWorld’s key destinations are above 2019 levels with the Asian market  in particular  recovering strongly.Bed prices are ahead of 2019 levels. In addition  he said Hostelworld’s new social network which was introduced to customers last year is proving “hugely popular and has helped deliver market share gains in key markets”.In a note  analysts at Goodbody said the feature helped separate HostelWorld from other online travel agents.In an update on its financials  the company said it has completed a refinancing of debt with new lender AIB.The deal involved the remaining size of an original €30m loan  following an earlier repayment of €10m.The new three-year facility with AIB is comprised of a €10m term loan  a €7.5m revolving credit facility (RCF) and an undrawn €2.5m.

Serveur Group is one of Europe's leading pioneers of the Internet  computer graphics  pattern recognition  and professional databases since 1987 (see TIME Magazine 2001) and therefore has a deep-rooted and highly-advanced digital and scientific culture.[ https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/05/AbodeofChaos-thierry-Ehrmann-IMG-3606.jpg ]copyright thierry Ehrmann - courtesy of La Demeure du Chaos / Abodeofchaos - Organ Museum of Contemporary ArtOver the past few decades  Artprice by Artmarket.com and Serveur Group have developed thousands of increasingly powerful and relevant proprietary algorithms that allow the implementation of their own AI  in strict compliance with existing regulations  notably those relative to personal data and intellectual property.This evolution was made possible by Serveur Group's and then Artprice's subsequent acquisition of innovative companies Like Xylogic  a Swiss company made up exclusively of prestigious scientists (from CERN  WHO  etc.) since 1999. In retrospect  this move (and others) was considerably ahead of its time  and it laid the foundations for our move toward the use of Artificial Intelligence to enhance the transparency and dynamism of the art market.It is important to remember that Artprice by Artmarket has twice consecutively (a rare occurrence for companies listed on a regulated market) been awarded France's state-backed “Innovative Company” label which is subject to strict eligibility and is awarded by the Banque Publique d'Investissement (bpifrance).As regards the current legislative context  we note that quite apart from the battery of legislation regarding General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)  the proposed European law on artificial intelligence (EU AI Act) and all existing intellectual property laws mean that the use of artificial intelligence in Europe (and probably the rest of the world shortly thereafter) will be subject to a great many constraints.The principle problem may be expressed as follows: how to deliver a relevant AI result to users without walking all over intellectual property rights? Remember that the outcome of any search using Artificial Intelligence is only  in fine  a result contrived by the algorithmic processing of billions of already existing data.Then there is the problem of ascertaining who owns the data in order to pay any copyright and related rights to be able to use it legally for commercial purposes… configuring a paid service that respects the intellectual property laws of each country… that is the challenge (no less!).According to thierry Ehrmann  founder of Artprice and CEO of Artmarket.com  Artprice by Artmarket will be able  through its own AI Intuitive Artmarket®  to take each of its 7.2 million customers and members “from discovery to revelation…”.“...Our algorithms can parse billions of proprietary logs  texts  and hundreds of millions of artworks from Artprice's databases. They can identify semantics that qualify an artist's primary artistic ambitions  his/her universe  inspirations  mediums used  major themes developed  shapes and volumes worked  etc... and then search for corresponding syntonies in our logs of 810 000 artists with their biographies and certified data. In other words  instead of relying on academic visual criteria  the system will make connections based on the neural networks of our artificial intelligence  Intuitive Artmarket®.”Neural networks  also called ‘artificial neural networks' (ANNs) or just ‘neural nets' are a subset of machine learning and are at the heart of deep-learning algorithms. Their name and structure are inspired by the human brain  mimicking the way biological neurons and their synapses send signals to each other along the axons.Artprice by Artmarket.com's spiking neural networks rely on initial data training that teaches them to learn and improve their accuracy over time. Once these learning algorithms are tuned with high precision  they represent powerful tools in the fields of computer science and artificial intelligence  and it is these AI algorithms that will allow Intuitive Artmarket® to classify and collate multimedia data at a very high speed.For example  high-definition images or even old fine art engravings can be recognized in seconds rather than tens of minutes in a manual identification process conducted by well-known fine art experts.If we look a the bigger picture  it has been very interesting to observe the trials and tribulations of one of the best-known neural networks on the planet  Google's search algorithm (which Artprice has been studying and analyzing daily since 1999). Since the beginning of 2023  Artprice Inc.  Artmarket's American subsidiary  has been closely watching the development of Bard  Google's prototype chatbot based on its LaMDA language model. Google CEO Sundar Pichai is acutely aware of the opportunities and risks in this project and is reported to have issued a company-wide “code red” for its development. Whether or not this is true  Google  with a global market share of 93%  is the best laboratory for studying AI because it has a colossal existing economic dimension  unlike other AIs  where the risks (and economic profits) are still ‘potential'.Artprice by Artmarket's R&D department is creating spiking neural networks (SNNs) which ‘cogitate' differently from human beings  without biases from emotions or ‘disorders'. Our ambition is of course to put artificial intelligence at the service of art and art market professionals  institutions  collectors  and enthusiasts.So  quite apart from its technical and scientific competence  Artprice by Artmarket's overwhelming strength is its capacity to use its own high-value-added data  produced and delivered for 25 years now as World Leader in Art Market Information. Not only does our position guarantee an unmatched level of consistency and relevance with respect to the responses it gives to searches  but it also overrides many of the aforementioned copyright issues  since our data is… our data.Artprice by Artmarket.com is the most important market-info player in the global art market. Its Artprice department has the most comprehensive databases on art prices and art market indices  with more than 30 million indices and sales results concerning works by more than 810 000 artists.Artprice Images® provides unlimited access to the largest art market archive in the world  with its documentary collection of manuscripts and auction catalogs  forming a physical and digital library made up of 180 million images (or engravings) of artworks from 1700 to the present day  all checked and commented by art historians. In this very specific economic sector  no company in the world has such a high volume of ultra-qualified and proprietary data  with the original documentation being a very important asset and representing an almost impregnable barrier to entry.In addition  Artmarket  with its Artprice department  constantly enriches its databases with data from 6 500 auction houses and it continuously publishes art market trends for the world's main press agencies and 7 200 press titles around the world. This inexhaustible source of continually up to date data will ensure that Intuitive Artmarket® will be way ahead of its competitors.Very few companies in the world can claim to use AI on a proprietary terrain. And yet it is the only way of complying with the various intellectual property laws around the world  which are increasingly vast and complex  with grueling legal procedures taking over several years.Artprice by Artmarket has registered as a professional beta-tester with Microsoft® and its Bing® search engine linked to GPT-4. Bing's AI can search on the Internet  whereas ChatGPT (excluding plugins) is currently limited to a database that stops in the year 2021.The possibilities offered by the tool are therefore immense  hence its popularity: Microsoft® Bing Chat now attracts more than 100 million active daily users and comes with a commitment to “responsible AI” that respects copyrights and other related rights.The fact that Microsoft has just launched a paid subscription of $240/year to use its AI tool confirms the viability of this economic model for Artprice and its own AI  Intuitive Artmarket®.In thousands of beta-test searches with terms related to artists and the art market  Artprice by Artmarket has observed that the responses provided by Bing AI GPT-4 regularly quoted Artprice.com and Artmarket.com URLs as references for their sources. Microsoft's Bing works in partnership with OpenAI to provide an experience that encourages responsible use.As we have seen  the development and implementation of ‘responsible AI' is currently one of the major concerns of the G7 nations (announcement of April 30  2023)  as is the adoption of ‘global regulations' on AI in the shortest possible timeframe.Regarding copyright legislation in the context of artificial intelligence  the EU's Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said the bloc “should find a political agreement as early as this year” (Reuters News: April 30  2023)  which is very positive for Artmarket.com.We have also seen the Italian government's reaction to ChatGPT: it is strictly prohibited in Italy. This illustrates the kind of obstacle that AI developers face  regardless of their financial power and their lobbying capacity.The truth is  in the AI domain  the potential for IP conflict is exponential. Take for example Stability AI  the creator of an AI generating synthetic photos  currently being accused of having extracted millions of images from the databases of Getty Images.Artmarket's AI (Intuitive Artmarket ®) works exclusively within a perimeter of proprietary content and is therefore protected under intellectual property legislation. This proprietary content is an almost infinite data mine built over three decades and covering more than four centuries of art market activity. The net result is that the aforementioned obstacles and potential prohibitions do not concern us because we do not need to look elsewhere for data or answers to very specific searches by people working on or interested in art and/or the art market.This fact is  therefore  a guarantee not just of the sustainability of Artprice by Artmarket's economic model  but also of our shareholders' peace of mind and of considerable growth in the future of Artprice by Artmarket.com's business  with a constant increase in turnover.The use of artificial intelligence will increase Artmarket.com's revenue  while ultimately reducing its operating costs. Our Intuitive Artmarket® will provide our art market clients and participants with very relevant and truly personalized recommendations  allowing them to deepen their own knowledge of the art market  and de facto  will generate more sophisticated subscriptions and therefore a greater volume of annual recurring revenue (ARR).Intuitive Artmarket® will provide precise answers to users' searches quickly and the time saved will reduce energy consumption  which is fully in line with Artmarket's eco-responsible philosophy. As a result of the reliable  scientific  and sustainable avant-garde energy solutions implemented by Artprice by Artmarket  our CSR report testifies to an extremely positive ecological impact.At the forefront of digital regulations  Europe is currently drafting laws on AI with its “Artificial Intelligence Act” and Artprice by Artmarket is contributing to this process with its lawyers and advisers. The Act aims to establish a number of specific constraints taking into account personal data protection as well as copyright and exhaustive source citation.According to the best Anglo-Saxon financial analysts – who are one step ahead of Europe in this area – the only economically viable model that does not expose the economic entity (however big or small) to incessant legal proceedings is an AI-based on an extremely well-defined economic segment where information plays a key role  and where the entity in question has full intellectual property of all the Big Data (including Data mining)  and confirmed ownership of the copyrights and associated rights to that data on all its algorithms  databases  machine learning  and neural networks.In short  the AIs that will triumph with a very substantial economic gain  without major industrial or legal risk  are the economic entities that own the full intellectual property rights to all of the different stages of a proprietary AI in a defined market segment where high value-added information  at a high cost  is vital. This is precisely the case with our AI project Intuitive Artmarket® developed by Artprice by Artmarket.comMany researchers are trying to establish the genesis of AI.Of the myriad of possible answers to this question  Artprice was intrigued by an article that appeared on the website “The Conversation” (Academic rigor  journalistic flair). Entitled “Blaise Pascal and the beginnings of artificial intelligence”  the article offers a judicious answer: Blaise Pascal (1623-1662) can be credited with two essential innovations that make it possible to envisage artificial intelligence today: he developed the first mechanical calculator in history and he developed the first rudiments of the calculation of probabilities.According to thierry Ehrmann (biography Who's Who In France:https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/04/2023_2_Biographie-thierry-Ehrmann_WhosWhoInFrance.pdf )  Founder of Artprice and CEO of Artmarket  the Group's guideline for its AI is very simple: “There can be no artificial intelligence without human intelligence”.Image: [ https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/05/AbodeofChaos-thierry-Ehrmann-IMG-3606.jpg ]Copyright 1987-2023 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to contact our Econometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: econometrics@artprice.comTry our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demoSubscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

Th…,"ROTTERDAM  Netherlands  May 9  2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Infinity Recycling  Invest-NL and LyondellBasell announced today they have invested in Pryme N.V.  an innovative cleantech company  located in Rotterdam  the Netherlands  through an investment consortium. The group of investors contributed nearly EUR 13 million to support the commercialization of Pryme's pyrolysis process to convert used plastic into valuable products on an industrial scale. Pryme is currently building an advanced recycling plant in Rotterdam that is expected to start production later this year and plans to build a second larger-scale plant in 2025.""We are excited to welcome this group of strong investors at our side "" said Chris Herve  CEO of Pryme. ""Just like earlier investments by Infinity Recycling and Stichting Multistrat opened doors and allowed us to gain important market knowledge  we expect our new investors to each bring valuable experience and perspective to further develop our technology. With this dedicated support comes responsibility and expectation to deliver – a challenge we gladly accept.""Pryme has developed a new cost-effective approach to pyrolysis that allows used plastic to be recycled with a high conversion rate  on an industrial scale and with a lower carbon footprint. With the new capital  Pryme aims to accelerate the roll-out of this technology to help reduce the amount of plastic being incinerated or ending up in the environment.Jeroen Kelder  Managing Partner  Infinity Recycling  said: ""Infinity Recycling is pleased to announce that it has successfully assembled a strong consortium of investors to support its portfolio company Pryme in its next phase of growth. We are proud to have facilitated this important milestone for Pryme and are confident that this backing will be instrumental in its continued success.""Elisabeth Storm de Grave  Principal at Invest-NL  said: ""We are pleased to invest in Pryme in close cooperation with our portfolio fund Infinity Recycling and LyondellBasell. This investment round is a significant milestone for scaling up Pryme's advanced recycling capacities  which are critical to address those parts of the plastic waste streams that cannot be recycled through mechanical technologies. It clearly underlines the strong position of the Netherlands to address the plastic waste crisis.""""With increasing demand from society and customers for more circular products  we are thrilled to invest in fast-growing companies like Pryme to support the scale-up of new advanced recycling commercial operations and reduce the volume of used plastic sent to incineration "" said Martino Gabellich  LyondellBasell Vice President Advanced Recycling and Low Carbon Solutions. ""This investment supports our strategy to grow our circular and low carbon solutions   as we intend to use part of the pyrolysis oil produced from this new Pryme facility in our planned integrated hub in Cologne  Germany.""About Infinity RecyclingInfinity Recycling was established to create markets for end-of-life plastic streams by investing in plastic recycling valorization technologies.

Serveur Group is one of Europe's leading pioneers of the Internet  computer graphics  pattern recognition  and professional databases since 1987 (see TIME Magazine 2001) and therefore has a deep-rooted and highly-advanced digital and scientific culture.Photo - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2072231/Abodeofchaos.jpgCopyright thierry Ehrmann - courtesy of La Demeure du Chaos / Abodeofchaos - Organ Museum of Contemporary ArtOver the past few decades  Artprice by Artmarket.com and Serveur Group have developed thousands of increasingly powerful and relevant proprietary algorithms that allow the implementation of their own AI  in strict compliance with existing regulations  notably those relative to personal data and intellectual property.This evolution was made possible by Serveur Group's and then Artprice's subsequent acquisition of innovative companies Like Xylogic  a Swiss company made up exclusively of prestigious scientists (from CERN  WHO  etc.) since 1999. In retrospect  this move (and others) was considerably ahead of its time  and it laid the foundations for our move toward the use of Artificial Intelligence to enhance the transparency and dynamism of the art market.It is important to remember that Artprice by Artmarket has twice consecutively (a rare occurrence for companies listed on a regulated market) been awarded France's state-backed ""Innovative Company"" label which is subject to strict eligibility and is awarded by the Banque Publique d'Investissement (bpifrance).As regards the current legislative context  we note that quite apart from the battery of legislation regarding General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)  the proposed European law on artificial intelligence (EU AI Act) and all existing intellectual property laws mean that the use of artificial intelligence in Europe (and probably the rest of the world shortly thereafter) will be subject to a great many constraints.The principle problem may be expressed as follows: how to deliver a relevant AI result to users without walking all over intellectual property rights? Remember that the outcome of any search using Artificial Intelligence is only  in fine  a result contrived by the algorithmic processing of billions of already existing data.Then there is the problem of ascertaining who owns the data in order to pay any copyright and related rights to be able to use it legally for commercial purposes… configuring a paid service that respects the intellectual property laws of each country… that is the challenge (no less!).According to thierry Ehrmann  founder of Artprice and CEO of Artmarket.com  Artprice by Artmarket will be able  through its own AI Intuitive Artmarket®  to take each of its 7.2 million customers and members ""from discovery to revelation…"".""...Our algorithms can parse billions of proprietary logs  texts  and hundreds of millions of artworks from Artprice's databases. They can identify semantics that qualify an artist's primary artistic ambitions  his/her universe  inspirations  mediums used  major themes developed  shapes and volumes worked  etc... and then search for corresponding syntonies in our logs of 810 000 artists with their biographies and certified data. In other words  instead of relying on academic visual criteria  the system will make connections based on the neural networks of our artificial intelligence  Intuitive Artmarket®.""Neural networks  also called 'artificial neural networks' (ANNs) or just 'neural nets' are a subset of machine learning and are at the heart of deep-learning algorithms. Their name and structure are inspired by the human brain  mimicking the way biological neurons and their synapses send signals to each other along the axons.Artprice by Artmarket.com's spiking neural networks rely on initial data training that teaches them to learn and improve their accuracy over time. Once these learning algorithms are tuned with high precision  they represent powerful tools in the fields of computer science and artificial intelligence  and it is these AI algorithms that will allow Intuitive Artmarket® to classify and collate multimedia data at a very high speed.For example  high-definition images or even old fine art engravings can be recognized in seconds rather than tens of minutes in a manual identification process conducted by well-known fine art experts.If we look a the bigger picture  it has been very interesting to observe the trials and tribulations of one of the best-known neural networks on the planet  Google's search algorithm (which Artprice has been studying and analyzing daily since 1999). Since the beginning of 2023  Artprice Inc.  Artmarket's American subsidiary  has been closely watching the development of Bard  Google's prototype chatbot based on its LaMDA language model. Google CEO Sundar Pichai is acutely aware of the opportunities and risks in this project and is reported to have issued a company-wide ""code red"" for its development. Whether or not this is true  Google  with a global market share of 93%  is the best laboratory for studying AI because it has a colossal existing economic dimension  unlike other AIs  where the risks (and economic profits) are still 'potential'.Artprice by Artmarket's R&D department is creating spiking neural networks (SNNs) which 'cogitate' differently from human beings  without biases from emotions or 'disorders'. Our ambition is of course to put artificial intelligence at the service of art and art market professionals  institutions  collectors  and enthusiasts.So  quite apart from its technical and scientific competence  Artprice by Artmarket's overwhelming strength is its capacity to use its own high-value-added data  produced and delivered for 25 years now as World Leader in Art Market Information. Not only does our position guarantee an unmatched level of consistency and relevance with respect to the responses it gives to searches  but it also overrides many of the aforementioned copyright issues  since our data is… our data.Artprice by Artmarket.com is the most important market-info player in the global art market. Its Artprice department has the most comprehensive databases on art prices and art market indices  with more than 30 million indices and sales results concerning works by more than 810 000 artists.Artprice Images® provides unlimited access to the largest art market archive in the world  with its documentary collection of manuscripts and auction catalogs  forming a physical and digital library made up of 180 million images (or engravings) of artworks from 1700 to the present day  all checked and commented by art historians. In this very specific economic sector  no company in the world has such a high volume of ultra-qualified and proprietary data  with the original documentation being a very important asset and representing an almost impregnable barrier to entry.In addition  Artmarket  with its Artprice department  constantly enriches its databases with data from 6 500 auction houses and it continuously publishes art market trends for the world's main press agencies and 7 200 press titles around the world. This inexhaustible source of continually up to date data will ensure that Intuitive Artmarket® will be way ahead of its competitors.Very few companies in the world can claim to use AI on a proprietary terrain. And yet it is the only way of complying with the various intellectual property laws around the world  which are increasingly vast and complex  with grueling legal procedures taking over several years.Artprice by Artmarket has registered as a professional beta-tester with Microsoft® and its Bing® search engine linked to GPT-4. Bing's AI can search on the Internet  whereas ChatGPT (excluding plugins) is currently limited to a database that stops in the year 2021.The possibilities offered by the tool are therefore immense  hence its popularity: Microsoft® Bing Chat now attracts more than 100 million active daily users and comes with a commitment to ""responsible AI"" that respects copyrights and other related rights.The fact that Microsoft has just launched a paid subscription of $240/year to use its AI tool confirms the viability of this economic model for Artprice and its own AI  Intuitive Artmarket®.In thousands of beta-test searches with terms related to artists and the art market  Artprice by Artmarket has observed that the responses provided by Bing AI GPT-4 regularly quoted Artprice.com and Artmarket.com URLs as references for their sources. Microsoft's Bing works in partnership with OpenAI to provide an experience that encourages responsible use.As we have seen  the development and implementation of 'responsible AI' is currently one of the major concerns of the G7 nations (announcement of April 30  2023)  as is the adoption of 'global regulations' on AI in the shortest possible timeframe.Regarding copyright legislation in the context of artificial intelligence  the EU's Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said the bloc ""should find a political agreement as early as this year"" (Reuters News: April 30  2023)  which is very positive for Artmarket.com.We have also seen the Italian government's reaction to ChatGPT: it is strictly prohibited in Italy. This illustrates the kind of obstacle that AI developers face  regardless of their financial power and their lobbying capacity.The truth is  in the AI domain  the potential for IP conflict is exponential. Take for example Stability AI  the creator of an AI generating synthetic photos  currently being accused of having extracted millions of images from the databases of Getty Images.Artmarket's AI (Intuitive Artmarket ®) works exclusively within a perimeter of proprietary content and is therefore protected under intellectual property legislation. This proprietary content is an almost infinite data mine built over three decades and covering more than four centuries of art market activity. The net result is that the aforementioned obstacles and potential prohibitions do not concern us because we do not need to look elsewhere for data or answers to very specific searches by people working on or interested in art and/or the art market.This fact is  therefore  a guarantee not just of the sustainability of Artprice by Artmarket's economic model  but also of our shareholders' peace of mind and of considerable growth in the future of Artprice by Artmarket.com's business  with a constant increase in turnover.The use of artificial intelligence will increase Artmarket.com's revenue  while ultimately reducing its operating costs. Our Intuitive Artmarket® will provide our art market clients and participants with very relevant and truly personalized recommendations  allowing them to deepen their own knowledge of the art market  and de facto  will generate more sophisticated subscriptions and therefore a greater volume of annual recurring revenue (ARR).Intuitive Artmarket® will provide precise answers to users' searches quickly and the time saved will reduce energy consumption  which is fully in line with Artmarket's eco-responsible philosophy. As a result of the reliable  scientific  and sustainable avant-garde energy solutions implemented by Artprice by Artmarket  our CSR report testifies to an extremely positive ecological impact.At the forefront of digital regulations  Europe is currently drafting laws on AI with its ""Artificial Intelligence Act"" and Artprice by Artmarket is contributing to this process with its lawyers and advisers. The Act aims to establish a number of specific constraints taking into account personal data protection as well as copyright and exhaustive source citation.According to the best Anglo-Saxon financial analysts – who are one step ahead of Europe in this area – the only economically viable model that does not expose the economic entity (however big or small) to incessant legal proceedings is an AI-based on an extremely well-defined economic segment where information plays a key role  and where the entity in question has full intellectual property of all the Big Data (including Data mining)  and confirmed ownership of the copyrights and associated rights to that data on all its algorithms  databases  machine learning  and neural networks.In short  the AIs that will triumph with a very substantial economic gain  without major industrial or legal risk  are the economic entities that own the full intellectual property rights to all of the different stages of a proprietary AI in a defined market segment where high value-added information  at a high cost  is vital. This is precisely the case with our AI project Intuitive Artmarket® developed by Artprice by Artmarket.comMany researchers are trying to establish the genesis of AI.Of the myriad of possible answers to this question  Artprice was intrigued by an article that appeared on the website ""The Conversation"" (Academic rigor  journalistic flair). Entitled ""Blaise Pascal and the beginnings of artificial intelligence""  the article offers a judicious answer: Blaise Pascal (1623-1662) can be credited with two essential innovations that make it possible to envisage artificial intelligence today: he developed the first mechanical calculator in history and he developed the first rudiments of the calculation of probabilities.According to thierry Ehrmann (biography Who's Who In France:https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/04/2023_2_Biographie-thierry-Ehrmann_WhosWhoInFrance.pdf)  Founder of Artprice and CEO of Artmarket  the Group's guideline for its AI is very simple: ""There can be no artificial intelligence without human intelligence"".Image: [https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/05/AbodeofChaos-thierry-Ehrmann-IMG-3606.jpg]Copyright 1987-2023 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to contact our Econometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: [email protected]for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: Try our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demo(free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demo Subscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

Microsoft's Bing works in partnership with OpenAI to provide an experience that encourages responsible use.As we have seen  the development and implementation of 'responsible AI' is currently one of the major concerns of the G7 nations (announcement of April 30  2023)  as is the adoption of 'global regulations' on AI in the shortest possible timeframe.Regarding copyright legislation in the context of artificial intelligence  the EU's Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said the bloc ""should find a political agreement as early as this year"" (Reuters News: April 30  2023)  which is very positive for Artmarket.com.We have also seen the Italian government's reaction to ChatGPT: it is strictly prohibited in Italy. This illustrates the kind of obstacle that AI developers face  regardless of their financial power and their lobbying capacity.The truth is  in the AI domain  the potential for IP conflict is exponential. Take for example Stability AI  the creator of an AI generating synthetic photos  currently being accused of having extracted millions of images from the databases of Getty Images.Artmarket's AI (Intuitive Artmarket ®) works exclusively within a perimeter of proprietary content and is therefore protected under intellectual property legislation. This proprietary content is an almost infinite data mine built over three decades and covering more than four centuries of art market activity. The net result is that the aforementioned obstacles and potential prohibitions do not concern us because we do not need to look elsewhere for data or answers to very specific searches by people working on or interested in art and/or the art market.This fact is  therefore  a guarantee not just of the sustainability of Artprice by Artmarket's economic model  but also of our shareholders' peace of mind and of considerable growth in the future of Artprice by Artmarket.com's business  with a constant increase in turnover.The use of artificial intelligence will increase Artmarket.com's revenue  while ultimately reducing its operating costs. Our Intuitive Artmarket® will provide our art market clients and participants with very relevant and truly personalized recommendations  allowing them to deepen their own knowledge of the art market  and de facto  will generate more sophisticated subscriptions and therefore a greater volume of annual recurring revenue (ARR).Intuitive Artmarket® will provide precise answers to users' searches quickly and the time saved will reduce energy consumption  which is fully in line with Artmarket's eco-responsible philosophy. As a result of the reliable  scientific  and sustainable avant-garde energy solutions implemented by Artprice by Artmarket  our CSR report testifies to an extremely positive ecological impact.At the forefront of digital regulations  Europe is currently drafting laws on AI with its ""Artificial Intelligence Act"" and Artprice by Artmarket is contributing to this process with its lawyers and advisers. The Act aims to establish a number of specific constraints taking into account personal data protection as well as copyright and exhaustive source citation.According to the best Anglo-Saxon financial analysts – who are one step ahead of Europe in this area – the only economically viable model that does not expose the economic entity (however big or small) to incessant legal proceedings is an AI-based on an extremely well-defined economic segment where information plays a key role  and where the entity in question has full intellectual property of all the Big Data (including Data mining)  and confirmed ownership of the copyrights and associated rights to that data on all its algorithms  databases  machine learning  and neural networks.In short  the AIs that will triumph with a very substantial economic gain  without major industrial or legal risk  are the economic entities that own the full intellectual property rights to all of the different stages of a proprietary AI in a defined market segment where high value-added information  at a high cost  is vital. This is precisely the case with our AI project Intuitive Artmarket® developed by Artprice by Artmarket.comMany researchers are trying to establish the genesis of AI.Of the myriad of possible answers to this question  Artprice was intrigued by an article that appeared on the website ""The Conversation"" (Academic rigor  journalistic flair). Entitled ""Blaise Pascal and the beginnings of artificial intelligence""  the article offers a judicious answer: Blaise Pascal (1623-1662) can be credited with two essential innovations that make it possible to envisage artificial intelligence today: he developed the first mechanical calculator in history and he developed the first rudiments of the calculation of probabilities.According to thierry Ehrmann (biography Who's Who In France:https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/04/2023_2_Biographie-thierry-Ehrmann_WhosWhoInFrance.pdf)  Founder of Artprice and CEO of Artmarket  the Group's guideline for its AI is very simple: ""There can be no artificial intelligence without human intelligence"".Image: [https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/05/AbodeofChaos-thierry-Ehrmann-IMG-3606.jpg]Copyright 1987-2023 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to contact our Econometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: [email protected]for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: Try our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demo(free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demo Subscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

May 9  2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Guerbet  a global leader in medical imaging with more than 30 years of experience in MRI  announced today that based on the most recent scientific and clinical evidence  the ACR Committee on Drugs and Contrast Media has classified Elucirem™ (gadopiclenol) as a Group II agent.6 This next generation GBCA from Guerbet  highly stable macrocyclic gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA)  has the highest relaxivity in its class for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and is indicated for use in adults and children aged 2 years and older.1 4 Elucirem™ requires only half the gadolinium dose of conventional non-specific GBCAs  addressing practitioners' concerns about gadolinium exposure.2 3""This new classification from the ACR is a real game changer for the future of Elucirem™ "" said Jared Houk  Commercial Vice President at Guerbet. ""This is an important moment for our team as it really shows the benefit of this product and its potential in the market.""The classification states that gadopiclenol ""demonstrates kinetic stability and a long dissociation half-life that are comparable to other Group II macrocyclic agents. Based on the most recent scientific and clinical evidence  the ACR Committee on Drugs and Contrast Media considers the risk of NSF among patients exposed to standard or lower than standard doses of Gadopiclenol is sufficiently low or possibly nonexistent such that it has been classified as a Group II agent.""6Elucirem™ (Gadopiclenol) injection is used to detect and visualize lesions with abnormal vascularity in the central nervous system (brain  spine  and associated tissues) and the body (head and neck  thorax  abdomen  pelvis  and musculoskeletal system).1 Guerbet received FDA approval of Elucirem™ (NDA 216986) on September 21  2022 after priority review  a designation assigned to applications for drugs that provide significant improvements in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment  diagnosis  or prevention of serious conditions compared to available therapies.5GBCAs improve the contrast between lesions and surrounding tissues by accelerating the relaxation of protons thanks to interaction with gadolinium atoms. Gadopiclenol  the active drug substance of Elucirem™  has been designed to enable twice as much interaction  resulting in the highest relaxivity among all non-specific GBCAs.4 This allows use at half the conventional gadolinium dose to reveal high quality images.Elucirem is manufactured by Liebel-Flarsheim™ Company LLC  a Guerbet Group company  in Raleigh  North Carolina.About GuerbetAt Guerbet  we build lasting relationships so that we enable people to live better.

Avoid use of GBCAs in these patients unless the diagnostic information is essential and not available with non-contrasted MRI or other modalities. The risk for NSF appears highest among patients with:Chronic  severe kidney disease (GFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 )  orAcute kidney injury.Screen patients for acute kidney injury and other conditions that may reduce renal function. For patients at risk for chronically reduced renal function (for example  age >60 years  hypertension or diabetes)  estimate the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) through laboratory testing.Indications and UsageELUCIREM™ (gadopiclenol) injection is indicated in adult and pediatric patients aged 2 years and older for use with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to detect and visualize lesions with abnormal vascularity in the central nervous system (brain  spine  and associated tissues)  and the body (head and neck  thorax  abdomen  pelvis  and musculoskeletal system).ContraindicationsHistory of hypersensitivity reactions to ELUCIREMWarnings and PrecautionsNephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis: GBCAs increase the risk for NSF among patients with impaired elimination of the drugs. Avoid use of GBCAs among these patients unless the diagnostic information is essential and not available with non-contrast MRI or other modalities.

The GBCA-associated NSF risk appears highest for patients with chronic  severe kidney disease as well as patients with acute kidney injury. Hypersensitivity Reactions: With GBCAs  serious hypersensitivity reactions have occurred. In most cases  initial symptoms occurred within minutes of GBCA administration and resolved with prompt emergency treatment. Before ELUCIREM administration  assess all patients for any history of a reaction to contrast media  bronchial asthma and/or allergic disorders. These patients may have an increased risk for a hypersensitivity reaction to ELUCIREM.With GBCAs  serious hypersensitivity reactions have occurred. In most cases  initial symptoms occurred within minutes of GBCA administration and resolved with prompt emergency treatment. Before ELUCIREM administration  assess all patients for any history of a reaction to contrast media  bronchial asthma and/or allergic disorders. These patients may have an increased risk for a hypersensitivity reaction to ELUCIREM. Gadolinium Retention: Gadolinium is retained for months or years in several organs. Linear GBCAs cause more retention than macrocyclic GBCAs. Consequences of gadolinium retention in the brain have not been established. Pathologic and clinical consequences of GBCA administration and retention in skin and other organs have been established in patients with impaired renal function. While clinical consequences of gadolinium retention have not been established in patients with normal renal function  certain patients might be at higher risk. These include patients requiring multiple lifetime doses  pregnant and pediatric patients  and patients with inflammatory conditions. Consider the retention characteristics of the agent when choosing a GBCA for these patients. Minimize repetitive GBCA imaging studies  particularly closely spaced studies when possibleGadolinium is retained for months or years in several organs.

Extravasation and Injection Site Reactions: Injection site reactions such as injection site pain have been reported in the clinical studies with ELUCIREM. Extravasation during ELUCIREM administration may result in tissue irritation. Ensure catheter and venous patency before the injection of ELUCIREM.Injection site reactions such as injection site pain have been reported in the clinical studies with ELUCIREM. Extravasation during ELUCIREM administration may result in tissue irritation. Ensure catheter and venous patency before the injection of ELUCIREM. Interference with Visualization of Lesions Visible with Non-Contrast MRI: As with any GBCA  ELUCIREM may impair the visualization of lesions seen on non-contrast MRI. Therefore  caution should be exercised when Gadopiclenol MRI scans are interpreted without a companion non-contrast MRI scan.Adverse Reactions:In clinical trials  the most frequent adverse reactions that occurred in > 0.2% of patients who received ELUCIREM included: injection site pain  headache  nausea  injection site warmth  injection site coldness  dizziness  and localized swelling. Adverse reactions that occurred with a frequency ≤ 0.2% in patients who received 0.05 mmol/kg BWELUCIREM included: maculopapular rash  vomiting  worsened renal impairment  feeling hot  pyrexia  oral paresthesia  dysgeusia  diarrhea  pruritus  allergic dermatitis  erythema  injection site paresthesia  Cystatin C increase  and blood creatinine increase.Use in Specific PopulationsPregnancy: GBCAs cross the human placenta and result in fetal exposure and gadolinium retention. There are no available data on ELUCIREM use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects  miscarriage or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes.GBCAs cross the human placenta and result in fetal exposure and gadolinium retention.

This trajectory highlights the enormous potential of Sidetrade in the years ahead. On the one hand  our initial steps in the United States - which are already proving to be a robust growth driver - have exceeded expectations. On the other  our presence on both sides of the Atlantic  combined with our technological edge in Artificial Intelligence  enables us to increasingly achieve major successes with multinational corporations.Sidetrade is scaling up and becoming a global-leading player in its industry. At a time when Gartner has recognized Sidetrade as a Leader in its Magic Quadrant for the second year in a row  we expect to sustain a double-digit growth trajectory throughout 2023 and beyond  while maintaining strong profitability  which forms the cornerstone of our balanced development model.""Bookings  in line  with nearly €1 million in new Annual Recurring RevenueIn Q1 2023  new Annual Recurring Revenue (""ARR"") for Sidetrade totaled €0.89 million. This figure is in line with the usual level of quarterly bookings  of around €1 million in new ARR (excluding exceptional records). As expected  bookings were down year-on-year  which were significantly boosted when Sidetrade signed the largest contract in its history (see press release of February 21 2022 ). This contract alone accounted for €1.36 million  representing 62% of the total €2.17 million posted in Q1 2022. Restated for this exceptional base effect  the level of bookings in new ARR increased by 10% (€0.89 million versus €0.81 million).SaaS bookings are supplemented by €0.94 million of additional services on an annual basis (implementation  configuration  training  recurring services  etc.) compared with €1.09 million in Q1 2022  which also benefited from €0.3 million related to this exceptional contract. As a result  the Annual Contract Value (""ACV"") of new bookings in Q1 2023 was €1.83 million.The initial contract period for new customers (excluding renewals) extended to 48 months  compared with 40.8 months in the same quarter of the previous fiscal year.Sidetrade continued to increase international orders in Q1 2023  achieving more than 25% of bookings in the United States.Accelerated growth in revenue  up 17%  with +21% from SaaS subscriptionsSidetrade(€m) Q1 2023 Q1 2022 Change 'Order-to-Cash' Activities 9.6 8.1 19% of which SaaS Subscriptions 8.0 6.7 +21% 'Sales & Marketing' Activities 0.2 0.3 -29% Revenue 9.8 8.4 +17%2023 information is from consolidated  unaudited data.In Q1 2023  'Order-to-Cash' activities  which are a core business of the Company's strategy (98% of total revenue)  were up 19%  while SaaS subscriptions increased by 21%. As part of the Company's strategy  'Sales & Marketing' activities continued to decline in subscription terms  accounting for only €0.2 million in Q1 2023  i.e. 2% of total revenue. As a result  their impact on total growth will diminish in the quarters ahead.Revenue for Q1 2023 totaled €9.8 million  representing an increase of 17% compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year which confirms Sidetrade's solid start to the year. This accelerated growth is attributable to two factors:Surge in activities in the United States  up 58%In Q1 2023  Sidetrade's revenue was underpinned by growth in international markets  which now represent 55% of total revenue  including 26% in North America. Sidetrade's international expansion strategy is producing the desired results  particularly in the United States where revenues surged 58%. As such  the United States is now a robust growth driver for Sidetrade.Impressive growth with multinational corporations  up 60%When analyzing customer profiles for 'Order-to-Cash' activities  the share of subscriptions with multinational corporations  on annual subscription contracts in excess of €250 000  recorded impressive growth of more than 60% in Q1 2023.Sidetrade's presence in Europe and North America  combined with its technological edge in Artificial Intelligence  has enabled the Company to achieve multiple commercial successes with multinational companies that seek to deploy an 'Order-to-Cash' solution on a global scale. This market segment accounts for 43% of Sidetrade's total subscriptions and is expected to remain an important growth driver in the months ahead.Quarter after quarter  Sidetrade stands out as a global leader in the Order-to-Cash segment. Sidetrade was recently recognized as a Leader in the Gartner latest Magic Quadrant for Integrated Invoice-to-Cash Applications (see press release of May 8 2023 )  demonstrating the relevance of the Company's solution which meets the needs of customers the world over.With its business model based on 90% recurring revenue  Sidetrade is strongly positioned to address economic uncertainties with resilience. It should also be noted that all Sidetrade subscription contracts  including new contracts  provide an annual automatic price re-indexation clause based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the relevant country. To that end  the Company's pricing power protects its future revenue against inflationary pressures.Next investor meetingsTP ICAP Annual Conference: May 11  2023 (France  Pavillon Gabriel  Paris 8th arrondissement)Oddo BHF NextCap Forum Days: June 6 and 8  2023 (France  Oddo BHF headquarters)Annual Shareholder General Meeting: June 15  2023 (France  Sidetrade headquarters  from 11:00 a.m. CEST)Investor & media relationsChristelle Dhrif +33 6 10 46 72 00 cdhrif@sidetrade.comAbout Sidetrade ( www.sidetrade.com )Sidetrade (Euronext Growth: ALBFR.PA) provides a SaaS platform dedicated to securing and accelerating cash flow.
