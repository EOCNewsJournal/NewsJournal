The Nomination Committee proposes the following amendment to the Nomination Committee's instruction: Upon appointment of the Nomination Committee  the chairperson of the board may be invited to the meetings of the Nomination Committee but shall not be included in the Nomination Committee as is the current wording. The Nomination Committee's proposal on new instructions for the Nomination Committee in its entirety is stated below.The Nomination Committee shall consist of three representatives nominated by the three largest shareholders per the last business day in September. The chairperson of the Board may be invited to the meetings of the Nomination Committee. The chairperson of the Nomination Committee shall be the member appointed by the largest shareholder in terms of voting rights  unless the Nomination Committee unanimously appoints another representative as the chairperson of the Nomination Committee.The assignment of the Nomination Committee is to present the following proposals to the Annual General Meeting:Election of board membersElection of chairperson of the BoardElection of auditorRemunerations for the board members and the auditorsPrinciples that shall apply to the composition and work of the Nomination Committee for the next Annual General Meeting.Resolution on authorisation to issue shares (agenda item 16)The assessment of the Board is that the Company will need additional financing to implement the activities that are included in the Company's business plan in the following twelve months. The Company's capital need is estimated to approximately SEK 15-25 million. Therefore  the board of directors intends to continue to evaluate possible alternatives to secure financing to meet the Company's financial needs  such as a capital contribution (such as an issue of new shares with or without deviation from the shareholders pre-emption rights) or a loan financing.The Board's assessment is  considering the Company's financial situation and the current conditions on the capital market  that it is of great importance that the Board has an extensive mandate in order to be able to act in a time and cost-efficient way to pursue the financing alternatives that become available as well as the mandate and relevant prerequisites to negotiate with potential investors and financers. Therefore  the mandate provided to the Board should include to resolve on share issues with deviation from the shareholders pre-emption rights.Therefore  the Board proposes that the general meeting authorises the Board to resolve  whether on one or several occasions  during the period up to the next annual general meeting  to increase the Company's share capital by issue of new shares. The Board shall be authorised to adopt resolutions on issues of shares with or without deviation from the shareholders' pre-emption rights.An issue in accordance with this authorisation shall be on market conditions. The Board shall be authorised to decide the terms in general for share issues resolved in accordance with this authorisation and who should be entitled to subscribe for the shares. The reason for that the Board should be able to resolve issues of new shares with deviation from the shareholders pre-emption rights is to give the Board the possibility to resolve on directed issues if the Board deems that it is the best alternative to secure financing to meet the Company's financial needs.It is proposed that the managing director is authorised to make such minor adjustments to this resolution that may be necessary in connection with the registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and Euroclear Sweden AB.SharesAt the time of the issue of this notice  the total number of shares in the Company amounts to 26 460 512  corresponding to a total number of votes of 26 460 512. On 2 May 2023  the General Meeting resolved on an issue of an additional 22 402 744 new shares  which at the time of the issue of this notice have not been registered at the Swedish Companies Registration Office. The Company does not hold any own shares.Majority requirementsResolution under item 16 above requires  for its validity  that a minimum of two thirds of the votes cast and the shares represented support the resolution.DocumentationThe annual report  the consolidated accounts and the auditors' report  and complete proposals on resolutions will be held available at the Company and on the Company's website in accordance with the Swedish Companies Act.

STAHL with strong growth and significant increase in profitability in the first quarter of 202310.05.2023 / 07:00 CET/CESTThe issuer is solely responsible for the content of this announcement.R. STAHL with strong growth and significant increase in profitability in the first quarter of 2023Order intake increases by 28.7% to € 96.7 million – Group sales up 28.0% to € 78.1 millionStrongly improved earnings from January to March – EBITDA pre exceptionals increase by € 7.4 million to € 10.4 million – This resulted in an EBITDA margin pre exceptionals of 13.3% (previous year: 5.0%)For 2023  R. STAHL expects sales to increase to between € 305 million and € 320 million and EBITDA pre exceptionals to improve to between € 30 million and € 36 million.Waldenburg  10 May 2023 – R. STAHL had a dynamic start to financial year 2023. Demand for the company’s products and services was very high in all regions and industries in the first quarter of 2023. Not only that  but the negative impact from disrupted supply chains is gradually weakening. The expert in explosion protection was thus able to improve almost all important financial key figures in the first three months of the year.Order intake increases by 28.7% – order backlog reaches new record level of € 125.7 millionThe continued high level of customer willingness to invest led to a year-on-year increase in order intake of 28.7% to € 96.7 million in the period from January to March 2023. The main drivers of this increase included the Central region (Africa and Europe excluding Germany) with a plus of 48.7% as well as Germany with a plus of 25.0%. Both regions benefited from a substantial increase in order intake from the oil and gas industry (including LNG) as well as higher order intake from the chemical industry. Due to strong demand in the first three months of 2023  the order backlog increased to a record level of € 125.7 million as of 31 March (31 December 2022: € 109.4 million).All regions contribute to sales growth of 28.0% to € 78.1 millionAn increasingly relaxed supply chain and a further increase in demand from all areas resulted in sales growth in the first quarter. R. STAHL thus increased sales from January to March 2023 by 28.0% to € 78.1 million. The company recorded double-digit growth rates in all sales regions. The main sales drivers here too were the chemical and pharmaceutical industries as well as the oil and gas sector (including LNG).Significant increase in profitability – EBITDA pre exceptionals up € 7.4 million to € 10.4 millionR. STAHL compensated for rising material prices in the reporting period with price adjustments and temporary inflation surcharges. This  combined with the higher utilization of production capacities  led to a sharp increase in profitability. At € 10.4 million  EBITDA pre exceptionals was € 7.4 million higher than the prior-year figure of € 3.0 million. The company increased its profitability as measured by the EBITDA margin from 5.0% in the previous year to an extraordinarily high 13.3%. Net profit also improved significantly to € 3.9 million (Q1 2022: € -5.4 million). This corresponds to earnings per share of € 0.60 (Q1 2022: € -0.84).The significantly increased volume of business from January to March led to an increase in inventory and receivables and thus to an increase in working capital of € 15.3 million (Q1 2022: € 9.8 million). This had a negative impact on free cash flow  which at € ‑8.7 million was € 1.4 million lower than in the previous year (Q1 2022: € -7.3 million). As a result  the equity ratio of 26.7% was almost stable (31 December 2022: 27.5%).Strong first quarter 2023 confirms outlook for full year 2023For 2023  the company expects a further recovery in the relevant key markets based on the overall economic and industry-specific forecasts. The high order backlog as well as the positive first quarter of 2023 mean that R. STAHL can look ahead to full year 2023 with confidence. Forecast uncertainties remain  however  mainly due to procurement bottle­necks – especially for semiconductor products – as well as continuing high inflation rates and unpredictable developments and consequences of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.For the current financial year  the Executive Board forecasts growth in Group sales in the low double-digit percentage range to between € 305 million and € 320 million. Profita­bility is expected to improve significantly year-on-year on the basis of a general improve­ment in procurement markets and due to increased cost efficiency. EBITDA pre exception­nals should increase significantly and be within a corridor of between € 30 million and € 36 million (2022: € 22.3 million). In terms of free cash flow  R. STAHL forecasts a low single-digit positive million euro amount in 2023.“The first quarter of 2023 confirmed the strategy we are pursuing. What we have to do now is efficiently process the high order intake while simultaneously continuing to take advantage of the growth opportunities in our markets in order to grow profitably in the long term”  says Dr. Mathias Hallmann  CEO of R.

In 1975  at the age of only 13  he opened his Studio Photo Nationale to take commercial portrait photographs. Initially  he made self-portraits to fill the unused parts of his photographic films but it became a mode of representation the artist has never abandoned.“I started taking self-portraits simply to use up spare film; people wanted their photographs the next day  even if the roll wasn’t finished  and I didn’t like waste. The idea was to send some pictures to my mother in Nigeria  to show her I was all right ” he has previously told the Guardian.Samuel Fosso  Self-Portrait (Tommie Smith).

Photograph: © Samuel Fosso Courtesy the artist and JM Patras  Paris“Then I saw the possibilities. I started trying different costumes  poses  backdrops. It began as a way of seeing myself grow up  and slowly it became a personal history – as well as art  I suppose. In 1994  there was an exhibition of African photography in Mali. I looked out some of my self-portraits  and won first prize. Now my work has been exhibited in Paris  New York  London.”Described as “a man of 1 000 faces”  Fosso plays the role of leading historical figures in front of the camera  which also includes Mao Zedong  Malcolm X and Patrice Lumumba  demonstrating photography’s role in the construction of myths.Anne-Marie Beckmann  the director of the Deutsche Börse Photography Foundation  said Fosso’s retrospective “opened up new perspectives  allowing many more people to discover his work for the first time; and thrilled and surprised those who felt they already knew it”.“Through the retrospective we were able to see his work differently and gain a much deeper understanding of the relevance of his practice today ” she said.The jury also acknowledged the work of the other shortlisted artists – Bieke Depoorter  Arthur Jafa and Frida Orupabo  who received £5 000 each.The exhibition showcasing all four artists is at the Photographers’ Gallery until 11 June.,neutral,0.01,0.98,0.0,mixed,0.41,0.17,0.42,True,English,"['Deutsche Börse photography prize', 'Man', '1,000 faces', 'Maison Européenne de la Photographie', 'The Cameroonian-born Nigerian photographer Samuel Fosso', 'Deutsche Börse Photography Foundation prize', 'Deutsche Börse jury', 'leading historical figures', 'Martin Luther King', 'traditional, studio-based approach', 'contemporary political issues', 'Central African Republic', 'important living photographers', 'commercial portrait photographs', 'other shortlisted artists', 'Samuel Fosso Courtesy', 'African photography', 'first prize', 'contemporary artists', 'African Spirits', 'Photographers’ Gallery', 'Angela Davis', 'extraordinary platform', 'Black voices', 'sustained exploration', 'same time', 'Biafran war', 'young boy', 'Photo Nationale', 'unused parts', 'photographic films', 'spare film', 'Tommie Smith', 'JM Patras', 'Malcolm X', 'different costumes', 'New York', 'Mao Zedong', 'Patrice Lumumba', 'Anne-Marie Beckmann', 'new perspectives', 'first time', 'deeper understanding', 'Bieke Depoorter', 'Arthur Jafa', 'Frida Orupabo', 'four artists', 'Shoair Mavlian', 'personal history', '£30,000 prize', 'retrospective exhibition', 'style', 'industry', 'London', 'Thursday', 'award', 'recognition', 'Paris', 'career', '50 years', 'director', 'chair', 'work', 'self-portraiture', 'today', 'humour', 'authenticity', 'uncle', 'Bangui', 'age', 'self-portraits', 'mode', 'representation', 'people', 'roll', 'waste', 'idea', 'pictures', 'mother', 'Guardian', 'series', 'possibilities', 'poses', 'backdrops', 'way', 'Mali', '1,000 faces', 'role', 'front', 'camera', 'construction', 'myths', 'many', 'relevance', 'practice', '11 June', '©']",2023-05-11,2023-05-11,theguardian.com

Eckert & Ziegler Strahlen- und Medizintechnik AG (ISIN DE0005659700  TecDAX) increased its sales by 16% to EUR 57.9 million in the first quarter of 2023. Net income amounted to EUR 4.7 million or EUR 0.23 per share and was thus 29% lower than in the same quarter of the previous year  mainly due to currency losses as well as Inflation adjustments.The significant increase in sales results from the sustainable growth in demand for radioisotopes for pharmaceutical and industrial applications. This is offset by a lower gross margin due to a weaker product mix in the Isotope Products segment. The main drivers of the decline in earnings compared to the previous year are however losses in the context of valuations of balance sheet items in foreign currencies and inflation adjustments in the hyperinflationary country of Argentina  which were not included in the first quarter of the previous year  totaling around EUR 1.5 million.Sales in the Medical segment amounted to EUR 24.1 million in the first three months of the year  around EUR 4 million or 20% above the level of the previous year. The main growth driver continues to be the pharmaceutical radioisotope business  and sales of laboratory equipment also increased again. There were slight declines in the Radiation Therapy segment  due to the sale of Wolf-Medizintechnik GmbH and the HDR business.The Isotope Products segment generated sales of EUR 33.8 million  a rise of EUR 4 million or around 13% compared to the first three months of 2022. Almost all main product groups contributed to this good performance. In contrast  high-margin sales of radiation sources for use in the energy sector recorded a significantly weaker first quarter than in the previous year.The forecast for fiscal year 2023 published on March 30  2023 remains unchanged.

In a challenging macroeconomic market environment  MPC Capital's business model has continued to prove very robust. While revenues from transactions were still at a moderate level  MPC Capital benefited from a further stabilization of revenue streams from management services and co-investments in the first quarter. MPC Capital also sees significant growth opportunities from a high demand for investments in sustainable real assets. Significant increase in recurring management fees Recurring management fees increased from EUR 6.4 million in the prior-year quarter to EUR 7.4 million in the first quarter of 2023. The growth came mainly from the Shipping and Renewables segments. As expected  revenues from the Real Estate segment declined significantly due to the sale of the Dutch real estate activities completed in the first quarter of the previous year. In the first quarter of 2023  MPC Capital was able to execute transactions across asset classes. For example  MPC Capital was able to acquire another property for the ESG Core Residential Fund and  with the initiation of a 65 MWp photovoltaic project  laid the foundation for the market entry of MPC Energy Solutions in Guatemala. In the Shipping segment  MPC Capital managed the sale of three container ships. In total  transaction fees amounted to EUR 1.1 million. At EUR 4.2 million  the first quarter of the previous year was characterized by successful real estate exits. Total revenue thus declined from EUR 10.7 million in the prior-year quarter to EUR 8.6 million in the first quarter of 2023. However  the share of recurring management fees of total revenue further increased. Stable income from co-investments and profitability remains at a high level Operating profitability in Q1 2023 was positively impacted by the reduced recurring cost base: personnel expenses decreased to EUR 4.3 million in Q1 2023 (Q1 2022: EUR 4.9 million). Other operating expenses decreased to EUR 4.3 million (Q1 2022: EUR 4.6 million). The financial result in the first quarter of 2023 was EUR 4.0 million (Q1 2022: EUR 1.8 million) and resulted from returns from the co-investment portfolio of MPC Capital. Stable income from the investments is also expected for the following quarters. Earnings before taxes (EBT) amounted to EUR 4.1 million after the first three months of 2023. The adjusted EBT (EBT adj.) of the prior-year quarter was even higher at EUR 5.7 million due to the above-average transaction fees. The EBT margin was 48%  compared to 53% (adjusted) in the previous year. The cash position was almost unchanged at EUR 69.4 million (31 December 2022: EUR 69.1 million). The equity ratio increased to 86% as of 31 March 2023 (31 December 2022: 82%). Forecast for 2023 confirmed The Management Board confirms its forecast for the full year 2023. Adjusted for the special effect from the sale of the Dutch real estate activities  a further improvement in profitability is expected in the financial year 2023. Consolidated profit before tax is expected to be in a range between EUR 15.0 million and EUR 20.0 million due to a lower cost base and continued high income from co-investments. Sales are expected to be at a comparable level to the previous year. Operationally  the main focus of business activities in 2023 will be on the further expansion of the investment platforms for renewable energies  sustainable real estate projects  and maritime activities - with a focus on projects related to the decarbonization of shipping. ""In a challenging market environment  we have managed to maintain our profitability at a high level. And we are convinced that we will be able to expand it even further over the year "" said Ulf Holländer  CEO of MPC Capital AG. ""We see a strong long-term increase in demand for investments in sustainable real assets. Achieving global climate targets requires immense investments in alternative forms of energy generation  energy efficiency or the climate-neutral renewal of maritime infrastructure. All of this provides a strong tailwind for MPC Capital's business model.""

At a time when Gartner has recognized Sidetrade as a Leader in its Magic Quadrant for the second year in a row  we expect to sustain a double-digit growth trajectory throughout 2023 and beyond  while maintaining strong profitability  which forms the cornerstone of our balanced development model.""Bookings  in line  with nearly €1 million in new Annual Recurring RevenueIn Q1 2023  new Annual Recurring Revenue (""ARR"") for Sidetrade totaled €0.89 million. This figure is in line with the usual level of quarterly bookings  of around €1 million in new ARR (excluding exceptional records). As expected  bookings were down year-on-year  which were significantly boosted when Sidetrade signed the largest contract in its history (see press release of February 21 2022 ). This contract alone accounted for €1.36 million  representing 62% of the total €2.17 million posted in Q1 2022. Restated for this exceptional base effect  the level of bookings in new ARR increased by 10% (€0.89 million versus €0.81 million).Story continuesSaaS bookings are supplemented by €0.94 million of additional services on an annual basis (implementation  configuration  training  recurring services  etc.) compared with €1.09 million in Q1 2022  which also benefited from €0.3 million related to this exceptional contract. As a result  the Annual Contract Value (""ACV"") of new bookings in Q1 2023 was €1.83 million.The initial contract period for new customers (excluding renewals) extended to 48 months  compared with 40.8 months in the same quarter of the previous fiscal year.Sidetrade continued to increase international orders in Q1 2023  achieving more than 25% of bookings in the United States.Accelerated growth in revenue  up 17%  with +21% from SaaS subscriptionsSidetrade(€m) Q1 2023 Q1 2022 Change ‘Order-to-Cash’ Activities 9.6 8.1 19% of which SaaS Subscriptions 8.0 6.7 +21% ‘Sales & Marketing’ Activities 0.2 0.3 -29% Revenue 9.8 8.4 +17%2023 information is from consolidated  unaudited data.In Q1 2023  'Order-to-Cash' activities  which are a core business of the Company's strategy (98% of total revenue)  were up 19%  while SaaS subscriptions increased by 21%. As part of the Company's strategy  'Sales & Marketing' activities continued to decline in subscription terms  accounting for only €0.2 million in Q1 2023  i.e. 2% of total revenue. As a result  their impact on total growth will diminish in the quarters ahead.Revenue for Q1 2023 totaled €9.8 million  representing an increase of 17% compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year which confirms Sidetrade’s solid start to the year. This accelerated growth is attributable to two factors:Surge in activities in the United States  up 58%In Q1 2023  Sidetrade's revenue was underpinned by growth in international markets  which now represent 55% of total revenue  including 26% in North America. Sidetrade's international expansion strategy is producing the desired results  particularly in the United States where revenues surged 58%. As such  the United States is now a robust growth driver for Sidetrade.Impressive growth with multinational corporations  up 60%When analyzing customer profiles for ‘Order-to-Cash’ activities  the share of subscriptions with multinational corporations  on annual subscription contracts in excess of €250 000  recorded impressive growth of more than 60% in Q1 2023.Sidetrade's presence in Europe and North America  combined with its technological edge in Artificial Intelligence  has enabled the Company to achieve multiple commercial successes with multinational companies that seek to deploy an ‘Order-to-Cash’ solution on a global scale. This market segment accounts for 43% of Sidetrade's total subscriptions and is expected to remain an important growth driver in the months ahead.Quarter after quarter  Sidetrade stands out as a global leader in the Order-to-Cash segment. Sidetrade was recently recognized as a Leader in the Gartner latest Magic Quadrant for Integrated Invoice-to-Cash Applications (see press release of May 8 2023 )  demonstrating the relevance of the Company's solution which meets the needs of customers the world over.With its business model based on 90% recurring revenue  Sidetrade is strongly positioned to address economic uncertainties with resilience. It should also be noted that all Sidetrade subscription contracts  including new contracts  provide an annual automatic price re-indexation clause based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the relevant country. To that end  the Company's pricing power protects its future revenue against inflationary pressures.Next investor meetingsTP ICAP Annual Conference: May 11  2023 (France  Pavillon Gabriel  Paris 8th arrondissement)Oddo BHF NextCap Forum Days: June 6 and 8  2023 (France  Oddo BHF headquarters)Annual Shareholder General Meeting: June 15  2023 (France  Sidetrade headquarters  from 11:00 a.m. CEST)Investor & media relationsChristelle Dhrif +33 6 10 46 72 00 cdhrif@sidetrade.comAbout Sidetrade ( www.sidetrade.com )Sidetrade (Euronext Growth: ALBFR.PA) provides a SaaS platform dedicated to securing and accelerating cash flow.

This performance was driven by particularly robust growth in the Benelux  Italy  and Poland.In France  revenue for the first quarter of 2023 amounted to €101.6 million compared to €116.7 million a year ago. France now accounts for 40% of the group’s revenue.Connectivity Solutions generated revenue of €72.1 million  down 15% compared to the first quarter of 2022  as the market overall remains under pressure. As previously stated  the positive impact from the market share gained in the Southeast will not be apparent until the second quarter of the year.Revenue from Energy Solutions amounted to €11.9 million compared to €15.9 million the previous year  a decline of 25%. This business remains strongly impacted by the end of smart meter deployments in France  which only contributed revenue of €1.6 million over the period. Other activities  related to electric mobility and renewable energies  are not yet compensating for this loss of revenue. The pace of deployment for these new activities is still irregular which is typical of all new activities  as customers adjust their business model and operational processes  particularly in the B2C segment. Although they are part of a long-term sustainable growth strategy  revenue from these activities was stable in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022.Finally  Technology Solutions posted revenue of €17.7 million  up 9% over the quarter  driven by the increase in payment solution and security system installations  as well as related maintenance.Story continuesIn the Benelux  revenue in the first quarter of 2023 amounted to €82.8 million compared to €46.7 million a year earlier  representing organic growth of 77.2%.Revenue from Connectivity Solutions was up 92% over the quarter to €63.5 million  compared to €33.0 million in the first quarter of 2022. Solutions30 is one of the main players for fiber-optic deployments in the region and therefore stands to benefit substantially from momentum in this market.Revenue from Energy Solutions was up 52% at €14.6 million  compared with €9.6 million a year earlier. This business is driven by the ongoing deployment of smart meters in Flanders as well as the start of new contracts related to renewable energies and electric mobility.Revenue from Technology Solutions was up 15% to €4.8 million  compared with €4.2 million a year earlier.In all other countries  the group’s quarterly revenue was up 19.5% (19.2% organic growth) to €70.8 million  compared to €59.3 million a year earlier.In Germany  revenue amounted to €16.2 million compared to €14.4 million a year earlier  thanks to the telecom sector where the dynamic has begun to improve. Revenue in this market is still derived from historical activities (cable and DSL). Fiber-optic deployments are expected to start in the second half of the year.In Italy  revenue grew by 30% in the first quarter of 2023 to €19 million  driven by ultra-fast infrastructure deployments in Piedmont and the Aosta Valley on behalf of TIM and OpenFiber.On the Iberian Peninsula  revenue grew organically by 8% to €15.8 million. Energy Solutions  in particular the installation of electric charging stations  is the biggest contributor to this quarter’s growth.In Poland  revenue amounted to €11.6 million  up 74% (71% organic growth) thanks to market share gains in the Warsaw region and momentum from mobile-related activities.Finally  in the United Kingdom  Solutions30 generated revenue of €8.3 million for the quarter  down 7%  which is explained by the ongoing shift of telecom activities to the more promising fiber segment.OutlookThe group is off to a good start and is on track to return to double-digit growth in 2023  to surpass the €1-billion revenue milestone  and to gradually improve its margins over the course of the year.In a market environment marked by inflation and rising interest rates  the group remains confident for the medium and long term. It will prioritize growth to reach a critical size in all the geographical areas where it operates.Upcoming event2023 Q2 Revenue Report: July 25  2023About Solutions30 SEThe Solutions30 group is the European leader in solutions for new technologies.

This multi-mechanism oncolytic immunotherapy is administered intravenously in patients with recurrent metastatic advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).TG6050 seeks to overcome tumor resistance by initiating an antitumor response through multiple mechanisms of action that include oncolysis  the induction of an immune response together with high intra-tumoral concentrations of IL-12 and anti-CTLA4 antibody.The Delivir trial will enroll up to 36 patients with advanced NSCLC who have failed standard therapeutic options  including immune checkpoint inhibitors. The IV route is considered the most appropriate route of administration for this patient population with disseminated disease and multiple overt and occult metastases. Completion of the trial is expected in H2 2024.The potential for IV administration of Transgene's patented Invir.IO® platform has been seen in the data presented for TG6002. TG6050 will build on the safety profile of Transgene's backbone while enhancing the therapeutic potential of its two highly immunogenic payloads - IL-12 and a full length anti-CTLA-4 antibody - while limiting exposure to their systemic toxicity.,neutral,0.0,0.99,0.0,negative,0.01,0.18,0.81,True,English,"['Other news releases', 'Transgene', 'Information', 'P R E S S R E L E A S E', 'recurrent metastatic advanced non-small cell lung cancer', 'two highly immunogenic payloads', 'full length anti-CTLA-4 antibody', 'Phase I clinical trial', 'Novel IL-12-Armed Oncolytic Virus', 'Phase I Delivir trial', 'powerful antitumor immune response', 'Phase I Trial', 'novel multi-armed immunotherapy', 'Invir.IO® platform', 'high intra-tumoral concentrations', 'immune checkpoint inhibitors', 'multi-mechanism oncolytic immunotherapy', 'The Delivir trial', 'standard therapeutic options', 'potential addressable markets', 'The IV route', 'intravenous (IV) administration', 'advanced NSCLC', 'antitumor response', 'oncolytic viruses', 'anti-CTLA4 antibody', 'IV administration', 'Intravenous administration', 'therapeutic potential', 'First Patient', 'wider range', 'solid tumors', 'intratumoral administration', 'Euronext Paris', 'biotech company', 'virus-based immunotherapies', 'tumor resistance', 'multiple mechanisms', 'patient population', 'multiple overt', 'occult metastases', 'safety profile', 'systemic toxicity', 'Transgene', 'TG6050', 'patients', 'Strasbourg', 'France', 'CET', 'TNG', 'treatment', 'action', 'oncolysis', 'induction', 'disease', 'Completion', 'H2', 'data', 'TG600', 'backbone', 'exposure', '8:00']",2023-05-10,2023-05-11,marketscreener.com

The new tanks are designed to store waste-based feedstocks for the production of biodiesel and sustainable aviation fuel  and will help meet the rising demand for energy from renewable sources in Europe. Vopak Vlaardingen has a long-term commercial agreement with Shell to store the feedstocks for Shell's new biorefinery in Rotterdam. Shell's biorefinery will be one of Europe's largest sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production facilities  producing SAF and renewable diesel from waste materials such as used cooking oil  waste animal fat  and other residual products. Vopak Terminal Vlaardingen is strategically located in the Port of Rotterdam and is well-connected for logistics via vessels  barges  trucks  and trains. The terminal has extensive experience in storing products such as used cooking oil and tallow.In 2021  Vopak started repurposing part of the terminal for waste-based feedstocks that supports the energy transition. Vopak has invested approximately EUR 90 million in new infrastructure which further diversifies the Vlaardingen portfolio with state-of-the-art assets.This project is in line with Vopak's strategic goal to accelerate towards new energy by developing infrastructure solutions that support customers and society in decarbonisation.

Order intake was particularly strong in the Entertainment division  exceeding the pre-pandemic level driven by a record-high quarter for Cinema that demonstrated the strength and value of Barco's all-laser cinema portfolio. With a positive book-to-bill ratio  the orderbook strengthened to 530.1 million euro.Sales grew 20% versus the same quarter last year reflecting growth in all regions. The growth was most pronounced in the Entertainment division  fueled by both the Cinema and Immersive Experience markets  and also in Meeting Experience in the Enterprise division. Healthcare saw a decline in orders and sales as a large modality platform phased out while new substantial Surgical & Modality projects are phasing in. These are expected to contribute to the growth of Healthcare towards the end of the year.Quote of the CEO's  An Steegen & Charles Beauduin""The first quarter of 2023 gave Barco a solid foundation for continued growth throughout the year and the achievement of our stated financial goals for the year. We are particularly delighted with the strong results in Entertainment and Enterprise  which are mitigating the temporary softness that Healthcare is experiencing due to the phasing out and phasing in of projects.While we saw growth across all our regions  we were pleased to see markets reopening in China  which supports our confidence that this important geography will contribute significantly to Barco's growth in 2023  particularly in the second half of the year.""Outlook 2023 - currentThe following statements are forward looking on a like-for-like basis and actual results may differ materially.Assuming no significant changes in current market conditions  management is reconfirming its FY23 outlook  with an expected sales growth between 10 and 15% for 2023 versus the previous year.The EBITDA margin is expected to further improve and move above 14% for the full year 2023.Divisional breakdownHealthcare(in millions of euro) 1Q23 1Q22 1Q21 Change 1Q23 vs 1Q22 Orders 69.5 86.4 93.9 -20% Sales 73.9 77.7 63.5 -5%Order intake in Healthcare was down versus a strong first quarter a year ago  reflecting a mixed performance by region. While order intake grew in Asia  intake in EMEA was essentially flat  mostly due to a slower Diagnostic Imaging market in the UK. In Americas  order intake was significantly lower than last year  driven by the Surgical and Modality business unit due to a timing difference in orders between the phase out of a large modality project and the phase in of several new confirmed projects towards the end of this year.First quarter sales were 5% lower than the strong first quarter of last year  reflecting softness in the Surgical and Modality business unit  notably in the Americas  partially offset by growth in Diagnostic Imaging. Healthcare saw sales growth in Asia and a decline in EMEA and Americas.Enterprise(in millions of euro) 1Q23 1Q22 1Q21 Change 1Q23 vs 1Q22 Orders 62.4 65.6 51.8 -5% Sales 68.8 61.4 52.5 +12%Enterprise sales went up 12% versus last year  led by double-digit growth in Meeting Experience  with strong uptake in EMEA and Asian markets  more than offsetting lower sales in Large Videowalls. Meeting Experience orders were lower year-over-year  after a particularly strong fourth quarter in 2022  due to the announced price increase for ClickShare  effective January 1st  2023.For Large Videowalls  orders were essentially flat versus last year with differences among regions: order levels were stable in Asia  grew in EMEA driven by the Middle East and declined in Americas due to some project delays. Sales declined versus last year  mostly due to shifted project timelines in EMEA.Entertainment(in millions of euro) 1Q23 1Q22 1Q21 Change 1Q23 vs 1Q22 Orders 154.6 95.0 83.3 +63% Sales 104.3 67.1 55.7 +55%The Entertainment division delivered a very strong quarter with order intake growing 63% year-over-year. Cinema orders exceeded the pre-pandemic level  fueled by strong order intake in the Americas for Cinema-as-a-service. In Immersive Experience  order intake growth versus last year was seen in all regions  except Asia where China was still affected by the pandemic.Sales for the division grew 55% versus last year  with strong growth in EMEA and Americas. Asia saw a decline in sales for both Cinema and Immersive Experience  as China started recovering from the pandemic only towards the end of the quarter.Order intake & order bookOrder intake year-over-year(in millions of euro) 1Q23 1Q22 Change 1Q23 vs 1Q22 Order Intake 286.6 246.9 +16%Order intake quarter-over-quarter(in millions of euro) 1Q23 4Q22 3Q22 2Q22 1Q22 Order Intake 286.6 307.2 242.0 262.3 246.9Order book(in millions of euro) 31 Mar 2023 31 Dec 2022 30 Sep 2022 30 Jun 2022 31 Mar 2022 31 Dec 2021 Order book 530.1 496.5 527.6 537.7 530.4 487.0SalesSales year-over-year(in millions of euro) 1Q23 1Q22 Change 1Q23 vs 1Q22 Sales 247.0 206.3 +20% Excluding currency effect +18%Sales by division year-over-year(in millions of euro) 1Q23 1Q22 Change 1Q23 vs 1Q22 Healthcare 73.9 77.7 -5% Enterprise 68.8 61.4 +12% Entertainment 104.3 67.1 +55% Group 247.0 206.3 +20%Sales quarter-over-quarter(in millions of euro) 1Q23 4Q22 3Q22 2Q22 1Q22 Healthcare 73.9 94.4 83.4 86.2 77.7 Enterprise 68.8 94.5 74.0 87.3 61.4 Entertainment 104.3 134.6 104.8 92.8 67.1 Group 247.0 323.4 262.2 266.4 206.3Additional informationThe information given in this press release has not been reviewed by the statutory auditor.Request more informationWillem Fransoo  Director Investor Relations+32 56 26 23 22 or willem.fransoo@barco.comDisclaimerThis press release may contain forward-looking statements.

No shareholders have in advance  through absentee vote  proxy forms or otherwise  requested a full account of the results of the voting  see section 101(5) and (6) of the Danish Companies Act.

The chairman of the meeting stated that the company had already received submissions and questions from the shareholder Dansk Aktionærforening (Danish Shareholders Association). The chairman of the meeting read out the statement: In Denmark  corona/Covid-19 officially ceased to be a disease critical to society last year. That was particularly due to the willingness of Danes to get vaccinated and quick roll-out of vaccines. That has provided an appropriate herd immunity. That is knowledge that most Danes obtained a long time ago. I feel inclined to mention this since Topdanmark seems to live in the times of the frightened ones with electronic general meetings. There is no reason for that  and you can come out in the open. The shareholders will not bite you - even if the Russians have started a war in Europe  that is a far distance from Denmark. In the Danish Shareholders Association  we still support a GOOD investment.

This acceleration was driven by the more technical business activities (Respiratory  Nutrition-Perfusion-Stomatherapy)  which maintained strong momentum and recorded revenue of €75.4 million  up 23.0% (up 16.9% on an organic basis). The “Homecare” business revenue came in at €55.2 million  up 1.3% (up 0.1% on an organic basis). The unfavorable base effect linked to sales of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the Covid?19 pandemic diminished  but still had an impact of 4.4% on growth in the ""Homecare"" business. Excluding PPE sales  revenue was up 5.7%.This quarterly performance brings revenue for the first nine months of 2022-2023 to €380.1 million  up 13.6%  including organic growth of 6.4%. Scope effect for the period was €22.8 million.Breakdown of nine-month revenue by businessHomecare: Revenue totaled €163.2 million  up 4.1% (down 0.9% on an organic basis) despite a 58% contraction in PPE sales. Excluding PPE  the business overall grew by 8.8% (up 3.4% on an organic basis).In communities  the Group's revenue was unchanged at €72.5 million (down 1.6% on an organic basis). Excluding the impact of PPE sales  revenue was up 3.6% on an organic basis  reflecting the resilience of this business sector.In stores/online  revenue rose by 7.7% (down 0.3% on an organic basis) to €90.6 million. Excluding PPE  the segment grew by 3.2% on an organic basis.The “Respiratory” business posted revenue of €120.5 million  up 22.7% (up 11.9% on an organic basis). This excellent performance stemmed from ongoing strong momentum in France. Business also held up very well internationally  particularly in Spain where growth was very strong  further highlighting the Group's potential in this country. In the United Kingdom  revenue performance was supported by inflation-linked price increases  which have had an impact as from the third quarter. Lastly  the recently acquired companies  Medpro  Oxystore and 4SMed  also delivered an excellent performance.The “Nutrition-Perfusion-Stomatherapy” business reported revenue of €96.5 million  up 21.1% (up 14.0% on an organic basis). All segments of this business continued to perform well  delivering organic growth of between 8% and 20%.Overall  international activities increased in line with the Group's development strategy and now represent more than 18% of revenue (compared to 16% in the first nine months of 2021-2022).2022-2023 outlook confirmedGiven the good business momentum  Groupe Bastide is confidently reiterating its annual targets of around €510 million for revenue and a recurring operating margin of over 8.3%.As announced alongside our first-half results  the improvement in operating cash flow  already visible in the first half  remains a major priority.

This trajectory highlights the enormous potential of Sidetrade in the years ahead. On the one hand  our initial steps in the United States - which are already proving to be a robust growth driver – have exceeded expectations. On the other  our presence on both sides of the Atlantic  combined with our technological edge in Artificial Intelligence  enables us to increasingly achieve major successes with multinational corporations.Sidetrade is scaling up and becoming a global-leading player in its industry. At a time when Gartner has recognized Sidetrade as a Leader in its Magic Quadrant for the second year in a row  we expect to sustain a double-digit growth trajectory throughout 2023 and beyond  while maintaining strong profitability  which forms the cornerstone of our balanced development model.""Bookings  in line  with nearly €1 million in new Annual Recurring RevenueIn Q1 2023  new Annual Recurring Revenue (""ARR"") for Sidetrade totaled €0.89 million. This figure is in line with the usual level of quarterly bookings  of around €1 million in new ARR (excluding exceptional records). As expected  bookings were down year-on-year  which were significantly boosted when Sidetrade signed the largest contract in its history (see press release of February 21 2022 ). This contract alone accounted for €1.36 million  representing 62% of the total €2.17 million posted in Q1 2022. Restated for this exceptional base effect  the level of bookings in new ARR increased by 10% (€0.89 million versus €0.81 million).SaaS bookings are supplemented by €0.94 million of additional services on an annual basis (implementation  configuration  training  recurring services  etc.) compared with €1.09 million in Q1 2022  which also benefited from €0.3 million related to this exceptional contract. As a result  the Annual Contract Value (""ACV"") of new bookings in Q1 2023 was €1.83 million.The initial contract period for new customers (excluding renewals) extended to 48 months  compared with 40.8 months in the same quarter of the previous fiscal year.Sidetrade continued to increase international orders in Q1 2023  achieving more than 25% of bookings in the United States.Accelerated growth in revenue  up 17%  with +21% from SaaS subscriptionsSidetrade(€m) Q1 2023 Q1 2022 Change ‘Order-to-Cash’ Activities 9.6 8.1 19% of which SaaS Subscriptions 8.0 6.7 +21% ‘Sales & Marketing’ Activities 0.2 0.3 -29% Revenue 9.8 8.4 +17%2023 information is from consolidated  unaudited data.In Q1 2023  'Order-to-Cash' activities  which are a core business of the Company's strategy (98% of total revenue)  were up 19%  while SaaS subscriptions increased by 21%. As part of the Company's strategy  'Sales & Marketing' activities continued to decline in subscription terms  accounting for only €0.2 million in Q1 2023  i.e. 2% of total revenue. As a result  their impact on total growth will diminish in the quarters ahead.Revenue for Q1 2023 totaled €9.8 million  representing an increase of 17% compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year which confirms Sidetrade’s solid start to the year. This accelerated growth is attributable to two factors:Surge in activities in the United States  up 58%In Q1 2023  Sidetrade's revenue was underpinned by growth in international markets  which now represent 55% of total revenue  including 26% in North America. Sidetrade's international expansion strategy is producing the desired results  particularly in the United States where revenues surged 58%. As such  the United States is now a robust growth driver for Sidetrade.Impressive growth with multinational corporations  up 60%When analyzing customer profiles for ‘Order-to-Cash’ activities  the share of subscriptions with multinational corporations  on annual subscription contracts in excess of €250 000  recorded impressive growth of more than 60% in Q1 2023.Sidetrade's presence in Europe and North America  combined with its technological edge in Artificial Intelligence  has enabled the Company to achieve multiple commercial successes with multinational companies that seek to deploy an ‘Order-to-Cash’ solution on a global scale. This market segment accounts for 43% of Sidetrade's total subscriptions and is expected to remain an important growth driver in the months ahead.Quarter after quarter  Sidetrade stands out as a global leader in the Order-to-Cash segment.

This performance was driven by particularly robust growth in the Benelux  Italy  and Poland.In France  revenue for the first quarter of 2023 amounted to €101.6 million compared to €116.7 million a year ago. France now accounts for 40% of the group’s revenue.Connectivity Solutions generated revenue of €72.1 million  down 15% compared to the first quarter of 2022  as the market overall remains under pressure. As previously stated  the positive impact from the market share gained in the Southeast will not be apparent until the second quarter of the year.Revenue from Energy Solutions amounted to €11.9 million compared to €15.9 million the previous year  a decline of 25%. This business remains strongly impacted by the end of smart meter deployments in France  which only contributed revenue of €1.6 million over the period. Other activities  related to electric mobility and renewable energies  are not yet compensating for this loss of revenue. The pace of deployment for these new activities is still irregular which is typical of all new activities  as customers adjust their business model and operational processes  particularly in the B2C segment. Although they are part of a long-term sustainable growth strategy  revenue from these activities was stable in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the first quarter of 2022.Finally  Technology Solutions posted revenue of €17.7 million  up 9% over the quarter  driven by the increase in payment solution and security system installations  as well as related maintenance.In the Benelux  revenue in the first quarter of 2023 amounted to €82.8 million compared to €46.7 million a year earlier  representing organic growth of 77.2%.Revenue from Connectivity Solutions was up 92% over the quarter to €63.5 million  compared to €33.0 million in the first quarter of 2022. Solutions30 is one of the main players for fiber-optic deployments in the region and therefore stands to benefit substantially from momentum in this market.Revenue from Energy Solutions was up 52% at €14.6 million  compared with €9.6 million a year earlier. This business is driven by the ongoing deployment of smart meters in Flanders as well as the start of new contracts related to renewable energies and electric mobility.Revenue from Technology Solutions was up 15% to €4.8 million  compared with €4.2 million a year earlier.In all other countries  the group’s quarterly revenue was up 19.5% (19.2% organic growth) to €70.8 million  compared to €59.3 million a year earlier.In Germany  revenue amounted to €16.2 million compared to €14.4 million a year earlier  thanks to the telecom sector where the dynamic has begun to improve. Revenue in this market is still derived from historical activities (cable and DSL). Fiber-optic deployments are expected to start in the second half of the year.In Italy  revenue grew by 30% in the first quarter of 2023 to €19 million  driven by ultra-fast infrastructure deployments in Piedmont and the Aosta Valley on behalf of TIM and OpenFiber.On the Iberian Peninsula  revenue grew organically by 8% to €15.8 million. Energy Solutions  in particular the installation of electric charging stations  is the biggest contributor to this quarter’s growth.In Poland  revenue amounted to €11.6 million  up 74% (71% organic growth) thanks to market share gains in the Warsaw region and momentum from mobile-related activities.Finally  in the United Kingdom  Solutions30 generated revenue of €8.3 million for the quarter  down 7%  which is explained by the ongoing shift of telecom activities to the more promising fiber segment.OutlookThe group is off to a good start and is on track to return to double-digit growth in 2023  to surpass the €1-billion revenue milestone  and to gradually improve its margins over the course of the year.In a market environment marked by inflation and rising interest rates  the group remains confident for the medium and long term. It will prioritize growth to reach a critical size in all the geographical areas where it operates.Upcoming event2023 Q2 Revenue Report: July 25  2023About Solutions30 SEThe Solutions30 group is the European leader in solutions for new technologies.

This trajectory highlights the enormous potential of Sidetrade in the years ahead. On the one hand  our initial steps in the United States - which are already proving to be a robust growth driver – have exceeded expectations. On the other  our presence on both sides of the Atlantic  combined with our technological edge in Artificial Intelligence  enables us to increasingly achieve major successes with multinational corporations.Sidetrade is scaling up and becoming a global-leading player in its industry. At a time when Gartner has recognized Sidetrade as a Leader in its Magic Quadrant for the second year in a row  we expect to sustain a double-digit growth trajectory throughout 2023 and beyond  while maintaining strong profitability  which forms the cornerstone of our balanced development model.""Bookings  in line  with nearly €1 million in new Annual Recurring RevenueIn Q1 2023  new Annual Recurring Revenue (""ARR"") for Sidetrade totaled €0.89 million. This figure is in line with the usual level of quarterly bookings  of around €1 million in new ARR (excluding exceptional records). As expected  bookings were down year-on-year  which were significantly boosted when Sidetrade signed the largest contract in its history (see press release of February 21 2022 ). This contract alone accounted for €1.36 million  representing 62% of the total €2.17 million posted in Q1 2022. Restated for this exceptional base effect  the level of bookings in new ARR increased by 10% (€0.89 million versus €0.81 million).SaaS bookings are supplemented by €0.94 million of additional services on an annual basis (implementation  configuration  training  recurring services  etc.) compared with €1.09 million in Q1 2022  which also benefited from €0.3 million related to this exceptional contract. As a result  the Annual Contract Value (""ACV"") of new bookings in Q1 2023 was €1.83 million.The initial contract period for new customers (excluding renewals) extended to 48 months  compared with 40.8 months in the same quarter of the previous fiscal year.Sidetrade continued to increase international orders in Q1 2023  achieving more than 25% of bookings in the United States.Accelerated growth in revenue  up 17%  with +21% from SaaS subscriptionsSidetrade(€m) Q1 2023 Q1 2022 Change ‘Order-to-Cash’ Activities 9.6 8.1 19% of which SaaS Subscriptions 8.0 6.7 +21% ‘Sales & Marketing’ Activities 0.2 0.3 -29% Revenue 9.8 8.4 +17%2023 information is from consolidated  unaudited data.In Q1 2023  'Order-to-Cash' activities  which are a core business of the Company's strategy (98% of total revenue)  were up 19%  while SaaS subscriptions increased by 21%. As part of the Company's strategy  'Sales & Marketing' activities continued to decline in subscription terms  accounting for only €0.2 million in Q1 2023  i.e. 2% of total revenue. As a result  their impact on total growth will diminish in the quarters ahead.Revenue for Q1 2023 totaled €9.8 million  representing an increase of 17% compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year which confirms Sidetrade’s solid start to the year. This accelerated growth is attributable to two factors:Surge in activities in the United States  up 58%In Q1 2023  Sidetrade's revenue was underpinned by growth in international markets  which now represent 55% of total revenue  including 26% in North America. Sidetrade's international expansion strategy is producing the desired results  particularly in the United States where revenues surged 58%. As such  the United States is now a robust growth driver for Sidetrade.Impressive growth with multinational corporations  up 60%When analyzing customer profiles for ‘Order-to-Cash’ activities  the share of subscriptions with multinational corporations  on annual subscription contracts in excess of €250 000  recorded impressive growth of more than 60% in Q1 2023.Sidetrade's presence in Europe and North America  combined with its technological edge in Artificial Intelligence  has enabled the Company to achieve multiple commercial successes with multinational companies that seek to deploy an ‘Order-to-Cash’ solution on a global scale. This market segment accounts for 43% of Sidetrade's total subscriptions and is expected to remain an important growth driver in the months ahead.Quarter after quarter  Sidetrade stands out as a global leader in the Order-to-Cash segment. Sidetrade was recently recognized as a Leader in the Gartner latest Magic Quadrant for Integrated Invoice-to-Cash Applications (see press release of May 8 2023 )  demonstrating the relevance of the Company's solution which meets the needs of customers the world over.With its business model based on 90% recurring revenue  Sidetrade is strongly positioned to address economic uncertainties with resilience. It should also be noted that all Sidetrade subscription contracts  including new contracts  provide an annual automatic price re-indexation clause based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the relevant country. To that end  the Company's pricing power protects its future revenue against inflationary pressures.Next investor meetingsTP ICAP Annual Conference: May 11  2023 (France  Pavillon Gabriel  Paris 8th arrondissement)Oddo BHF NextCap Forum Days: June 6 and 8  2023 (France  Oddo BHF headquarters)Annual Shareholder General Meeting: June 15  2023 (France  Sidetrade headquarters  from 11:00 a.m. CEST)Investor & media relationsChristelle Dhrif +33 6 10 46 72 00 cdhrif@sidetrade.comAbout Sidetrade ( www.sidetrade.com )Sidetrade (Euronext Growth: ALBFR.PA) provides a SaaS platform dedicated to securing and accelerating cash flow.

Such documents can be obtained from the Climate Transition Capital website under the header Reports at www.climatetransitioncapital.com/investor-resources/.CTCA1 furthermore announces that it currently believes that the consummation of a suitable Business Combination before the Business Combination Deadline of 2 July 2023 is now highly unlikely. Since its IPO in June 2021  CTCA1 has reviewed several hundred potential targets  and had advanced discussions with many of them. Despite extensive efforts to date  none of these discussions has resulted in the consummation of a Business Combination.Since the IPO  the need to mobilise public capital markets to invest in the climate transition has become ever more apparent as we have witnessed further extreme weather  a global cost-of-living crisis and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. At the same time  the macro-economic context has become increasingly challenging with interest rates and inflation at levels not seen for decades. A banking crisis at the start of this year exacerbated what were already extremely difficult conditions for the equities markets and for new issuance in particular.Although ít is highly unlikely that CTCA1 will be able to complete a suitable Business Combination before the Business Combination Deadline  CTCA1 is continuing its search process up until that date. Should the search process result in a suitable Business Combination target being identified  an extension of the Business Combination Deadline would be required  and as such a general meeting would be convened and the corresponding Business Combination put to shareholder vote.In parallel  CTCA1 will prepare for its dissolution and liquidation  such that the Share Repurchase Arrangement can be launched in accordance with the Prospectus and the amount held in the Escrow Account for the benefit of the Ordinary Shareholders can be returned to those shareholders as soon as it is clear that there will not be a Business Combination. If no Business Combination can be completed by the Business Combination Deadline  CTCA1 is obliged to convene a general meeting for the purpose of adopting a resolution to (i) dissolve and liquidate the Company and (ii) pursue delisting of the Ordinary Shares and Market Warrants within 3 months.,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,negative,0.0,0.09,0.91,True,English,"['Climate Transition Capital Acquisition', 'Annual General Meeting', 'CTCA1', '22 June', 'Return', 'Cash', 'Shareholders', 'Climate Transition Capital Acquisition 1 BV', 'several hundred potential targets', 'Climate Transition Capital website', 'special purpose acquisition company', 'suitable Business Combination target', 'public capital markets', 'Share Repurchase Arrangement', 'Business Combination Deadline', 'corresponding Business Combination', 'Annual General Meeting', 'equities markets', 'UNITED STATES', 'SOUTH AFRICA', 'RELEVANT LAWS', 'Further details', 'explanatory notes', 'Such documents', 'header Reports', 'extensive efforts', 'extreme weather', 'global cost', 'living crisis', 'same time', 'macro-economic context', 'interest rates', 'banking crisis', 'difficult conditions', 'new issuance', 'search process', 'shareholder vote', 'Escrow Account', 'Ordinary Shares', 'Market Warrants', 'OTHER JURISDICTION', 'PRESS RELEASE', 'Euronext Amsterdam', 'Thursday 22 June', 'Ordinary Shareholders', 'DISTRIBUTION', 'WHOLE', 'PART', 'CANADA', 'AUSTRALIA', 'JAPAN', 'VIOLATION', 'return', 'cash', '10 May', 'SPAC', 'AGM', 'agenda', 'convocation', 'investor-resources', 'CTCA1', 'consummation', '2 July', 'IPO', 'discussions', 'date', 'none', 'need', 'Russia', 'invasion', 'Ukraine', 'inflation', 'levels', 'decades', 'start', 'year', 'extension', 'parallel', 'dissolution', 'liquidation', 'accordance', 'Prospectus', 'amount', 'benefit', 'resolution', 'delisting', '3 months', '11:00']",2023-05-10,2023-05-11,marketscreener.com
