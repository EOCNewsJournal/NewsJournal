Our Q1 2023 organic revenue growth reached +8.2% outside China and -14.0% in China.Digital Out-Of-Home (DOOH) grew by +13.3% in reported growth and +13.6% organically in Q1 2023  to reach 31.2% of Group revenue vs 29.1% in Q1 2022 including a continued strong momentum of the programmatic advertising sales ecosystem through the VIOOH SSP (Supply Side Platform) and Displayce DSP (Demand Side Platform).By activity  Street Furniture was strong at +4.1% organically in Q1 2023 and was above Q1 2019 globally including double-digit above Q1 2019 in France and Rest of Europe; Billboard grew by +1.0% on an organic basis in Q1 2023  above Q1 2019 in Asia-Pacific and North-America; Transport grew strongly by +7.9% organically  including a double-digit revenue growth in France  Rest of Europe  UK and Rest of the World reflecting the ongoing audience recovery in both airports and public transport across most regions with Rest of the World above 2019 in Q1. From a historically low level of activity  China improved throughout the quarter following the end of mobility restrictions at the end of 2022.By geography  Rest of the World  Asia-Pacific excluding China  France and Rest of Europe were the fastest growing regions while revenue for North America and China decreased in Q1 2023 but the trading momentum improved significantly in these two geographies in March.As far as Q2 is concerned  we expect organic revenue growth around +9% mostly driven by a strong digital growth and a gradual recovery in China while advertising sales in most geographies remain solid.In China  we are seeing encouraging signs of recovery with domestic mobility now back to normal leading us to a strong year-on-year double-digit revenue growth in Q2. As domestic air travel reached an all-time high for the Labor Day holiday  our domestic airport business is expected to almost recover to pre-Covid levels in Q2  in line with the air traffic rebound. Our strong revenue growth in China for Q2 is nevertheless affected by low international air traffic due to much reduced international airlines connections and the non-renewal of the Guangzhou International Terminal 2 airport advertising contract as well as our decision to mutually terminate our joint venture with Guangzhou metro.As the most digitised global OOH media company  with our new data-led audience targeting and programmatic solutions  our well diversified portfolio  our ability to win new contracts  the strength of our balance sheet  the high quality of our teams across the world and our recognised ESG excellence  we believe we are well positioned to benefit from the rebound. We are more than ever confident in the power of our media in an advertising landscape increasingly fragmented and more and more digital and in the role it will play to drive economic growth as well as positive changes.”Following the adoption of IFRS 11 from January 1st  2014  the operating data presented below is adjusted to include our prorata share in companies under joint control.

Data from the study is expected to be available in H1 2024.Developed by Mithra  Estelle is the first and only contraceptive pill containing estetrol (E4)  the only estrogen native to human pregnancy. The objective of the pediatric study (MIT-Es001-C303  ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04792385  EudraCT: 2019-003002-27) is to evaluate the safety  compliance  and pharmacokinetics profile of Estelle (estetrol monohydrate 15 mg and drospirenone 3 mg) in 100 participants aged 12 to 17 years old  as agreed with regulatory authorities. The study is being conducted in a number of European countries (Estonia  Finland  Georgia  Latvia  Poland  Sweden).Graham Dixon  Chief Scientific Officer of Mithra  commented: « The completion of recruitment for this pediatric study represents an important milestone in our commitment to bringing Estelle to a wider patient population. We look forward to reporting data from this trial in 2024 and expanding the body of scientific data available to clinicians to support their decision-making. »Professor Kristina Gemzell-Danielsson  Chair of Obstetrics and Gynecology and Head of the Department of Women's and Children's Health  Karolinska Institutet  and Karolinska University Hospital  Stockholm  Sweden  commented: « Combined Oral Contraceptives such as Estelle are the most popular hormonal contraceptives1 in the adolescent population  and adolescents are more likely than adult women to use these products for health purposes other than birth control such as cycle and bleeding control2. Despite widespread use in adolescents  clinical data from this population is limited. Studies such as this one are needed in order to bring safe and effective contraceptives to those that need it most. »********1.

These data are very encouraging for patients who have limited  if any  treatment options  especially for those who have failed prior CD19 directed CAR T-cell therapy and allogeneic stem cell transplant” said Mark Frattini  M.D.  Ph.D.  Chief Medical Officer at Cellectis.Poster Presentation:BALLI-01 investigation UCART22 product candidate in r/r B-ALLThe abstract includes preliminary clinical data from the Phase 1/2a  open label dose-escalation BALLI-01  in patients with r/r B-ALL having received UCART22 following lymphodepletion (LD) with either fludarabine  cyclophosphamide (FC) or FC with alemtuzumab (FCA).The data show that UCART22 was well tolerated and clinical responses were achieved. UCART22 continues to have a good safety profile  with no serious treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) or DLTs reported. Overall  these data support the safety and preliminary efficacy of UCART22 in a heavily pretreated r/r B-ALL population.UCART22 is a genetically modified allogeneic T-cell product manufactured from healthy donor cells. Donor-derived T-cells are transduced using a lentiviral vector to express the anti-CD22 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) and are further modified using Cellectis’ TALEN® technology to disrupt the T-cell receptor alpha constant (TRAC) and CD52 genes to minimize risk of graft-vs-host disease (GvHD) and allow use of an anti-CD52 antibody for lymphodepletion (LD).Presentation Details:Title: Updated Results of the Phase I BALLI-01 Trial of UCART22  an Anti-CD22 Allogeneic CAR-T Cell Product  in Patients with Relapsed or Refractory (R/R) CD22+ B-Cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (B-ALL)Presenter: Nicolas Boissel  M.D.  Ph.D.  Hôpital St Louis  Assistance Publique – Hôpitaux de Paris  Paris  FranceAbstract and logistic details are available on www.ehaweb.orgAbout CellectisCellectis is a clinical-stage biotechnology company using its pioneering gene-editing platform to develop life-saving cell and gene therapies.

Shareholders who were unable to attend the Edenred General Meeting in person were able to watch it live online in French or English thanks to a special system in place for the second consecutive year. The quorum stood at 84.58%. The General Meeting adopted all the resolutions proposed by the Board of Directors  notably the payment of a dividend of €1.00 per share in respect of 2022  entirely in cash  with an ex-dividenddate of June 7  2023 and a payment date of June 9  2023. The composition of the Board of Directors remained unchanged at the close of the General Meeting  as no directors' terms of office expired and no new appointments were proposed. The Board therefore continues to comprise 12 members  including two employee-representative directors. It includes five women appointed by the General Meeting (representing 50% of its shareholder-appointed members) and the proportion of independent directors is 80% (8/10) based on the calculation method in the AFEP-MEDEF Code  which excludes employee-representative directors.

In an environment shaped by accelerating new structural trends  from changes in the working world to a new era of mobility and global ecosystem digitization  Edenred is the global platform of choice at work. Edenred operates in markets that are still largely underpenetrated and that therefore harbor many growth opportunities  reinforced by widespread adoption of new behaviors. Against this backdrop  the Group intends to leverage to the full its unique global platform advantage by developing a common approach in each of its business lines based on three priorities: Scale the Core: grow further in still underpenetrated core marketsExtend Beyond: accelerate Beyond Food  Fuel and Payment strategiesExpand in New Businesses: seize new development opportunities The Beyond22-25 strategic plan will drive sustainable and profitable growth and generate high levels of free cash flow over the 2022-2025 period. Edenred has also placed ESG at the heart of its Beyond22-25 plan. Jacques Adoue  Executive Vice President  Human Resources and Corporate Social Responsibility  and Flore Cholley  ESG and Sustainable Development Director  spoke about the acceleration of Edenred's ESG policy. The Group has committed to achieving net zero carbon by 2050  in line with SBTi targets1  and has stepped up the objectives of its ""Ideal"" CSR policy  with the aim of cementing its status as an employer of choice and a trustworthy Tech for Good company through its solutions that encourage more virtuous and responsible behaviors. 2022: a year once again driven by excellent financial and non-financial performance Julien Tanguy  Executive Vice President  Finance  commented on Edenred's record financial performance in 2022  reaping the rewards of sustained investments in technology to innovate and disrupt the Group's markets. Driven by robust growth in revenue  which exceeded the €2 billion mark  Edenred's EBITDA and net profit rose at a record rate to their highest ever levels. These results show Edenred's ability to keep penetrating its markets while scaling its platform advantage by aggregating  orchestrating and distributing a growing number of solutions. This trend was borne out once again in the first quarter of 2023  with even higher revenue growth than in 2022  continuing to demonstrate Edenred's ability to offer solutions that are closely aligned with the changing needs of companies and their employees. In 2022  Edenred's strong ESG commitment has resulted in non-financial indicator results that outperform the objectives set out in the three components of its CSR policy: People  Planet and Progress. Moreover  the Group is increasingly recognized for its commitment to environmental  social and governance (ESG) practices. In September 2022  for example  Edenred joined the Paris stock exchange's Euronext CAC 40 ESG index  taking its place alongside other companies demonstrating ESG best practices. On the strength of these results  in 2023  Edenred intends to maintain a sustained pace of growth in all regions where the Group operates and in each of its business lines. The Group will therefore continue to fully leverage its unique platform advantage by rolling out its Beyond22-25 strategic plan. 1 For scopes 1  2 and 3a. www.edenred.com | page 2/3",neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,neutral,0.02,0.96,0.01,True,English,"['2023 General Meeting', 'Edenred', 'resolutions', 'Chief Executive Officer Angeles Garcia-Poveda', 'unique global platform advantage', 'Angeles Garcia Poveda', 'Executive Vice President', 'second consecutive year', 'Maëlle Gavet', 'Françoise Gri', 'Bernardo Sanchez Incera', 'Philippe Vallée', ""Dominique D'Hinnin"", 'Corporate Social Responsibility', 'global ecosystem digitization', 'net zero carbon', 'new structural trends', 'new development opportunities', 'many growth opportunities', 'free cash flow', 'Ideal"" CSR policy', 'Lead Independent Director', 'Jean-Romain Lhomme* Lhomme', 'Combined General Meeting', 'Sustainable Development Director', 'new strategic plan', 'record financial performance', 'employee-representative director Hamel', 'The General Meeting', 'two employee-representative directors', 'Edenred General Meeting', '2023 General Meeting', 'CSR Committee', 'net profit', 'record rate', 'new era', 'new behaviors', 'New Businesses', 'Jean-Bernard Hamel', 'profitable growth', 'excellent financial', 'robust growth', 'Press release', 'Comet Bourse', '35 rue Saint-Marc', 'Bertrand Dumazy', 'special system', 'five women', 'calculation method', 'AFEP-MEDEF Code', 'Sylvia Coutinho', 'Graziella Gavezotti', 'Monica Mondardini', 'Risks Committee', 'Commitments Committee', 'working world', 'widespread adoption', 'common approach', 'three priorities', '2022-2025 period', 'Beyond22-25 plan', 'Jacques Adoue', 'Human Resources', 'Flore Cholley', 'SBTi targets', 'trustworthy Tech', 'Good company', 'responsible behaviors', 'Julien Tanguy', '€2 billion mark', 'growing number', 'first quarter', 'independent directors', 'new appointments', 'ESG policy', 'payment date', 'Payment strategies', ""directors' terms"", 'The Group', 'The Board', 'shareholder-appointed members', 'business lines', 'high levels', 'Edenred shareholders', 'core markets', '12 members', 'resolutions', '75002 Paris', 'chairmanship', 'person', 'French', 'English', 'place', 'quorum', 'respect', 'ex-dividenddate', 'June', 'composition', 'close', 'proportion', 'names', 'asterisk', 'Vice-Chairman', 'committees', 'result', 'membership', 'Audit', 'Compensation', 'choice', 'management', 'floor', 'October', 'environment', 'changes', 'mobility', 'backdrop', 'Food', 'Fuel', 'heart', 'acceleration', 'objectives', 'aim', 'status', 'employer', 'virtuous', 'Finance', 'rewards', 'investments', 'technology', 'revenue', 'EBITDA', 'highest', 'ability']",2023-05-11,2023-05-12,marketscreener.com

Our Q1 2023 organic revenue growth reached +8.2% outside China and -14.0% in China.Digital Out-Of-Home (DOOH) grew by +13.3% in reported growth and +13.6% organically in Q1 2023  to reach 31.2% of Group revenue vs 29.1% in Q1 2022 including a continued strong momentum of the programmatic advertising sales ecosystem through the VIOOH SSP (Supply Side Platform) and Displayce DSP (Demand Side Platform).By activity  Street Furniture was strong at +4.1% organically in Q1 2023 and was above Q1 2019 globally including double-digit above Q1 2019 in France and Rest of Europe; Billboard grew by +1.0% on an organic basis in Q1 2023  above Q1 2019 in Asia-Pacific and North-America; Transport grew strongly by +7.9% organically  including a double-digit revenue growth in France  Rest of Europe  UK and Rest of the World reflecting the ongoing audience recovery in both airports and public transport across most regions with Rest of the World above 2019 in Q1. From a historically low level of activity  China improved throughout the quarter following the end of mobility restrictions at the end of 2022.By geography  Rest of the World  Asia-Pacific excluding China  France and Rest of Europe were the fastest growing regions while revenue for North America and China decreased in Q1 2023 but the trading momentum improved significantly in these two geographies in March.As far as Q2 is concerned  we expect organic revenue growth around +9% mostly driven by a strong digital growth and a gradual recovery in China while advertising sales in most geographies remain solid.In China  we are seeing encouraging signs of recovery with domestic mobility now back to normal leading us to a strong year-on-year double-digit revenue growth in Q2. As domestic air travel reached an all-time high for the Labor Day holiday  our domestic airport business is expected to almost recover to pre-Covid levels in Q2  in line with the air traffic rebound. Our strong revenue growth in China for Q2 is nevertheless affected by low international air traffic due to much reduced international airlines connections and the non-renewal of the Guangzhou International Terminal 2 airport advertising contract as well as our decision to mutually terminate our joint venture with Guangzhou metro.As the most digitised global OOH media company  with our new data-led audience targeting and programmatic solutions  our well diversified portfolio  our ability to win new contracts  the strength of our balance sheet  the high quality of our teams across the world and our recognised ESG excellence  we believe we are well positioned to benefit from the rebound. We are more than ever confident in the power of our media in an advertising landscape increasingly fragmented and more and more digital and in the role it will play to drive economic growth as well as positive changes.”Following the adoption of IFRS 11 from January 1st  2014  the operating data presented below is adjusted to include our prorata share in companies under joint control. Please refer to the paragraph “Adjusted data” of this release for the definition of adjusted data and reconciliation with IFRS.The values shown in the tables are generally expressed in millions of euros. The sum of the rounded amounts or variations calculations may differ  albeit to an insignificant extent  from the reported values.Adjusted revenue for the first quarter 2023 increased by +5.6% to €721.3 million compared to €683.0 million in the first quarter of 2022.Excluding the negative impact from foreign exchange variations and the positive impact of changes in perimeter  adjusted revenue increased by +5.0%.Adjusted advertising revenue  excluding revenue related to sale  rental and maintenance of street furniture and advertising displays  increased by +4.2% on an organic basis in the first quarter of 2023.By activity:Q1 adjusted revenue 2023 (€m) 2022 (€m) Reported growth Organic growth(a) Street Furniture 364.3 347.5 +4.8% +4.1% Transport 254.0 234.9 +8.1% +7.9% Billboard 103.0 100.6 +2.4% +1.0% Total 721.3 683.0 +5.6% +5.0%a.

Our Q1 2023 organic revenue growth reached +8.2% outside China and -14.0% in China.Digital Out-Of-Home (DOOH) grew by +13.3% in reported growth and +13.6% organically in Q1 2023  to reach 31.2% of Group revenue vs 29.1% in Q1 2022 including a continued strong momentum of the programmatic advertising sales ecosystem through the VIOOH SSP (Supply Side Platform) and Displayce DSP (Demand Side Platform).By activity  Street Furniture was strong at +4.1% organically in Q1 2023 and was above Q1 2019 globally including double-digit above Q1 2019 in France and Rest of Europe; Billboard grew by +1.0% on an organic basis in Q1 2023  above Q1 2019 in Asia-Pacific and North-America; Transport grew strongly by +7.9% organically  including a double-digit revenue growth in France  Rest of Europe  UK and Rest of the World reflecting the ongoing audience recovery in both airports and public transport across most regions with Rest of the World above 2019 in Q1. From a historically low level of activity  China improved throughout the quarter following the end of mobility restrictions at the end of 2022.By geography  Rest of the World  Asia-Pacific excluding China  France and Rest of Europe were the fastest growing regions while revenue for North America and China decreased in Q1 2023 but the trading momentum improved significantly in these two geographies in March.As far as Q2 is concerned  we expect organic revenue growth around +9% mostly driven by a strong digital growth and a gradual recovery in China while advertising sales in most geographies remain solid.In China  we are seeing encouraging signs of recovery with domestic mobility now back to normal leading us to a strong year-on-year double-digit revenue growth in Q2. As domestic air travel reached an all-time high for the Labor Day holiday  our domestic airport business is expected to almost recover to pre-Covid levels in Q2  in line with the air traffic rebound. Our strong revenue growth in China for Q2 is nevertheless affected by low international air traffic due to much reduced international airlines connections and the non-renewal of the Guangzhou International Terminal 2 airport advertising contract as well as our decision to mutually terminate our joint venture with Guangzhou metro.As the most digitised global OOH media company  with our new data-led audience targeting and programmatic solutions  our well diversified portfolio  our ability to win new contracts  the strength of our balance sheet  the high quality of our teams across the world and our recognised ESG excellence  we believe we are well positioned to benefit from the rebound. We are more than ever confident in the power of our media in an advertising landscape increasingly fragmented and more and more digital and in the role it will play to drive economic growth as well as positive changes.”Following the adoption of IFRS 11 from January 1st  2014  the operating data presented below is adjusted to include our prorata share in companies under joint control.

This success is the result of a strategy combining an offer aligned with expectations  a reactive pricing policy to adapt to market conditions  a ramp-up of the marketplace launched in mid-2022 and the integration of logistics activities.Ramp-up of the marketplace in FranceIFRS (€000) H1 2021-2022 H1 2022-2023 Change E-commerce revenues[4] 72 989 77 183 +5.7% France 38 879 41 119 +5.8% Northern and Eastern Europe[5] 22 921 25 187 +9.9% Southern Europe[6] 11 190 10 877 -2.8%Vente-Unique.com posted e-commerce revenues  including marketplace fees  of €77.2 million in the first half of 2022-2023  representing growth of 5.7% over the half-year. After a first quarter (down 2.2%) devoted primarily to the gradual rebuilding of margins and the launch of the marketplace in France  e-commerce revenues rose 14.2% in the second quarter. The Group succeeded in combining growth in volumes and prices.The marketplace has confirmed its role as a new driver of sales performance  contributing 10% of overall revenues in France in March 2023  versus 5% in December 2022. In line with the roadmap  the international roll-out of the marketplace was initiated in Southern Europe (Spain and Italy) at the end of the Q2 2022-2023 and will continue in Northern Europe during the second half.The proportion of e-commerce revenues generated internationally in H1 2022-2023 was stable year-on-year at 47%  compared to 53% in France. Excluding short-term developments  the trends observed in Europe are relatively consistent.Additional revenues from logistics servicesSince the beginning of the financial year  Vente-Unique.com has consolidated the logistics activity resulting from the acquisition of the Distri Service business. This new activity  operated for both Vente-Unique.com and external customers  generated additional non-Group revenues of €3.8 million in the first half.Confirmation of the full-year outlookDuring the first half  Vente-Unique.com demonstrated its ability to gradually return to strong growth over the year  in line with the announced target.The Group's sales momentum has been achieved in a context of strict control of margins  despite the inertia linked to the cost price of inventories accumulated at the height of the inflationary crisis and the marketing investments made to support the ramp-up of the marketplace.

These patients can have up to 15 liters of extra fluid in their bodies  causing major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficult breathing and restricted mobility that severely impacts daily life. Although diuretics are standard of care  the problem is that in many patients they are no longer effective and / or tolerable. There are limited effective treatment options for these patients  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing ""diuretic-resistant"" patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  delivering major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients and reducing costs for healthcare systems. The Company has reported positive primary endpoint data from the North American pivotal POSEIDON trial of the alfapump in recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis  enabling the filing of a Pre-Market Approval (PMA) application with the FDA  planned for H2 2023.

This good performance is to be put into perspective with Procos data  which shows that average revenue growth for specialised retailers was 5% at the national level. This performance was due to a 4% increase in retailer revenue for stores of over 500 sqm and a 13% increase for stores of less than 500 sqm.Letting activity remained robust in first quarter 2023: 5 leases2 were signed  representing total rents of €0.5 million and a total floor area of 5 400 sqm.These include a lease signed with Carrefour for a total floor area of 3 500 sqm at the Halles du Beffroi shopping centre in Amiens. The retailer  which currently operates a store with a floor area of 2 900 sqm  intends to add a 600 sqm extension by taking over a vacant unit. This lease is still subject to the condition precedent of obtaining the necessary commercial authorisations.MRM notes that the Halles du Beffroi shopping centre is adjacent to a fresh produce market owned by the city of Amiens. The property’s management was contracted to Biltoki  a specialist in food retail markets  to oversee its rehabilitation and activities. The property is scheduled to open in spring 2024  after several months of works and improvements  which should boost the attractiveness of the site as a whole.The other new leases include a beauty salon that has moved into a vacant store in the Passage du Palais  a downtown shopping gallery located in the shopping district of Tours.This letting activity increased the physical occupancy rate3 by 1.0 point while the portfolio’s financial occupancy rate3 remained stable at the end-December 2022 level. At 31 March 2023  the physical and financial occupancy rates were 91% and 88%  respectively.Change in gross rental incomeGross rental income in first quarter 2023 was €3.80 million  a 62.3% increase from the same period in 2022. This major increase is due to the integration of the Flins and Ollioules shopping centres – acquired on 16 November 2022 – into MRM’s asset portfolio. These shopping centres contributed gross rental income of €1.38 million in the first three months of the year.On a like-for-like basis4  excluding the Flins and Ollioules shopping centres  gross rental income was up 3.6%. MRM benefited from indexation  which averaged 5.4% in first quarter 2023  as well as from the full impact of new leases signed in year 2022  especially at Carré Vélizy (Vélizy-Villacoublay) and Aria Parc (Allonnes). Yet these positive effects did not fully offset the negative impact of the departure of Camaïeu retail chain from the Valentin shopping centre (Besançon).€m Q12023 Q12022 Change Like-for-like change4 Total gross rental income 3.80 2.34 +62.3% +3.6%(unaudited figures)Statement of Non-Financial PerformanceOn 27 April 2023  MRM released for the first time a Statement of Non-Financial Performance (Déclaration de Performance Extra Financière  DPEF) for the year 2022. This proactive report is part of MRM’s intention to state publicly its extra-financial performances as part of its ESG long-term commitments to all stakeholders.In keeping with its decision to place priority on the challenges of climate change initially  the DPEF can already be used to track MRM’s progress on its trajectory towards achieving a more efficient  low-carbon energy mix by 2030:Consumption by surface area 5 of final energy demand 6 of MRM’s assets was already reduced by 25% in 2022 compared to historical benchmarks 7   which is in line with the trajectory targeting a 40% reduction by 2030 as specified in the Décret Tertiaire;of final energy demand of MRM’s assets was already reduced by 25% in 2022 compared to historical benchmarks   which is in line with the trajectory targeting a 40% reduction by 2030 as specified in the Décret Tertiaire; Emissions by surface area 5 of greenhouse gas for MRM’s assets were reduced by 33% compared to historical benchmarks 7   a performance that must be seen in the light of the 42% reduction required to reach the ceiling target by 2030  which corresponds to the sector trajectory defined by the Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor (CRREM);of greenhouse gas for MRM’s assets were reduced by 33% compared to historical benchmarks   a performance that must be seen in the light of the 42% reduction required to reach the ceiling target by 2030  which corresponds to the sector trajectory defined by the Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor (CRREM); MRM’s decarbonisation commitments are in line with the Paris Agreement on Climate Change  which limits global warming to +1.5°C by 2030.The DPEF will broaden over the years with the gradual enlargement of the scope of MRM’s extra-financial commitments  which will be accompanied by new targets.OutlookIn 2023  MRM will benefit from the full-year impact of the acquisition of the Flins and Ollioules shopping centres on rental income as well as on the improvement in operating profitability thanks to the better absorption of fixed costs.With its larger store portfolio and its relationships with a greater number of retailers and chains  MRM continues to mobilise around the following priorities:• Analysing and implementing investment programmes aimed at enhancing the value of properties  comprised of its historic portfolio and the two shopping centres acquired in late 2022;• Letting available space;• Rolling out the company’s ESG action plan;• Managing the property portfolio dynamically  by exploring potential acquisitions and disposals.MRM confirms that it is targeting annualised net rents of over €16 million by 2025. This target is based on the current portfolio (excluding any acquisitions and disposals).CalendarThe general shareholders’ meeting to approve the financial statements for 2022 will be held on 7 June 2023.Revenues for the second quarter and 2023 first half results will be released on 27 July 2023 after market close.About MRMMRM is a listed real estate company that owns and manages a portfolio of retail properties across several regions of France.

This validation comes 6 months after the signature of a 2-year framework contract with the distribution company Lan Chou Instruments to equip Mengniu with Heracles NEO electronic noses2.Mengniu is used to testing the most advanced technologies to monitor the quality of its products. They are the manufacturer first equipped with three Heracles NEO instruments to monitor under operational conditions the changes in the odor of its products over time  signs of possible abnormal aging  and also to validate the origin of the milk received in its processing plants.The equipment validation process was achieved in several steps. After two months of continuous testing by electronic noses and human panels in parallel  Mengniu's Quality Department  with the support of Alpha MOS engineers  established a statistical model for advanced sensory data processing. Two new cycles of data collection were carried out to improve the database and the calculation algorithm. Still with a technical support from Alpha MOS  the database was finally optimized to allow to control in a systematic way the smell of raw milk from different origins  to confirm their quality and to avoid the risks of adulteration.The Quality Department of the Chinese group explains in its press release:« It is the principle of Mengniu quality to use the most advanced equipment and technology to test the quality of products. The inspection office of the high-tech factory worked 6 months to validate [the instrument]. A total of 859 sets of data were tested by different sample components and by all raw milk suppliers [...] As a result of these tests  the introduction of the French electronic nose Heracles NEO was confirmed. »The electronic noses are now used daily in the first two sites equipped. Eventually  the objective is that the forty sites of the customer can check the integrity of the raw milk deliveries in a few minutes as soon as they arrive at the collection center. With the regular support of the Alpha MOS team engineers  the quality control process is constantly being optimized. Thanks to this continuous improvement work  the cost and time of checking a sample have already been significantly reduced.Satisfied with this first collaboration  the Quality Department of Mengniu is now testing the Iris  the electronic eye of Alpha MOS  in other applications such as the aging of processed dairy products and the conformity of labelling.Pierre SBABO  CEO of Alpha MOS  recently visited the headquarters of Mengniu. He comments: « The public validation of our sensory analysis solutions by Mengniu's technical teams  beyond the immediate potential of deployment in all or part of their production sites  is a key step in the adoption of our equipment by major food industry accounts and is fully in line with Alpha MOS' growth strategy.»Click here to see the publication of the Quality Department of Mengniu1Rabobank / classement 2022 « Global dairy Top 20”2Voir communiqué Alpha MOS du 14 novembre 2022About Alpha MOSAlpha MOS (Euronext Paris  ISIN: FR0013421286 ALM  Code mnémonique: ALNEO) specialist in sensory analysis solutions  is the world leader in the development of electronic nose  tongue and eye for industrial use.

Principal ActivitiesBoussard & Gavaudan Holding Limited (“BGHL” or “the Company”)  a closed-ended investment company incorporated under the laws of Guernsey  announces its interim management statement for the period from 1 January to 31 March 2023 (“the period”).The Company is registered with the Dutch Authority for Financial Markets and is listed on the NYSE Euronext Amsterdam  and the London Stock Exchange.During the period  BGHL has invested indirectly in BG Master Fund ICAV (“BG Fund” or “the Fund”)  a Europe-focused multi-strategy hedge fund established in Ireland and authorised by the Central Bank as a Qualified Investor Fund (QIF)  through a dedicated share class of the feeder fund  BG Umbrella Fund Plc.

PerformanceGlobal equity markets rallied during the period  in particular in Europe with the Euro Stoxx 50® Total Return up +14.2% while in the US the S&P500® Total Return was up +7.5%. The market implied volatility measure VStoxx® dropped from 20.9% to 19.4% and credit markets tightened with the iTraxx Crossover® (S38) moving from 474bps at year-end to 406ps at the end of March.1. BG FundBG Fund (EUR B) contributed negatively for the quarter.1.1. Volatility strategiesMandatory Convertible Bond ArbitrageMandatory convertible bonds contributed slightly positively during the period with performance driven by a general repricing in the market. No new issues were seen albeit the Investment Manager remains confident that supply is coming given the general pivot towards hybrid securities from issuers looking to reduce borrowing costs.Convertible Bond ArbitrageThe period saw convertible bonds giving back some of its previously positive performance over the last few months.In particular  US convertibles suffered mainly because of the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Credit Suisse situations  which caused the US two-year yield to drop very quickly. The sharp drop in rates adversely impacted interest rate hedges as convertible bond prices lagged; however these same hedges have supported the portfolio against previous moves and the Investment Manager expects some normalisation. Pricing for most European CBs was generally soft due to higher credit spreads and very low liquidity in the markets. There was no panic selling  but poor liquidity meant some low prints in very small volumes.The Investment Manager remains very constructive on the positions in the book which continue to carry well. The Investment Manager continues to grow the convertible book and sees a growing number of prospective opportunities in the pipeline.Volatility TradingVolatility trading contributed positively to performance in March as news flow helped to drive vol of vol higher. The Investment Manager traded actively during the period of maximum stress which had led to the creation of some very attractive  albeit relatively short-lived  opportunities. Dispersion strategies continued to carry well.Warrant TradingWarrant arbitrage & SPACs contributed slightly positively.1.2. Equity StrategiesEquity strategies suffered during the quarter. They were initially impacted by a general rally in short hedges as liquid stocks and indices outperformed idiosyncratic positions. Following this  uncertainty caused by the SVB bankruptcy and the Credit Suisse debacle  combined with renewed fears of recession from weaker economic data generated some further market volatility. This particularly impacted special situation positions as the market worried that the unstable macro environment may delay those catalysts. This notwithstanding the core theses remain intact and the Investment Manager expects these positions to realised their embedded value. Despite the market to market volatility the period also saw several positions continue to perform well due to both delivering strong results and where harder catalysts were present.Corporate activity is still much lower than expected in M&A  but as the picture stabilises  and companies adjust to the new interest rate environment  the Investment Manager expects activity to pick up further.1.3. Credit StrategiesCapital Structure ArbitrageCapital structure arbitrage was flat.Credit Long / ShortCredit long / short contributed positively during the period benefiting from the general positive trend.Credit Special SituationsCredit special situations were the main positive contributor to performance this quarter thanks to a combination of ongoing corporate improvements in the portfolio  a restructuring trade which was finalised in March and due to be completed in July as well as active trading around the restructuring of a Swiss bank.1.4. TradingTrading contributed negatively during the period  mostly due to the equity quantitative trading. This strategy has been a very helpful tool for risk managing the portfolio for many years however it has recently been too slow to react to rapid macro developments and the position is being cut pending further assessment.2. Investments Other Than BG FundThe contribution of this investment was flat on the period.Rasaland Investors (“RLI”)Rasaland Investors (“RLI”) RLI is a holding company structured as a private equity fund in terms of fees and organisation and managed by BK Partners. BGHL holds the RLI shares through Campastros  S.L.U.  a wholly-owned holding company in Spain. RLI is dedicated to investing in land  hotels and high-end resort developments in Mexico. RLI’s main asset is a majority interest in ACTUR  a private company owning the land developing assets. ACTUR’s other shareholders are Mexican public institutions.In July 2020  RLI made a cash tender offer to buy back its own shares  for a price per share of US$0.12270. The valuation of BGHL’s investment in RLI shares was marked down on 31 August 2020  using the US$0.12270 per share price as the estimated fair value of the RLI shares. This price represents a circa 80% discount to the latest published NAV per share.IV.

These forward-looking statements are based on current plans  estimates and beliefs of management. All statements  other than statements of historical facts  are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements  including estimates of revenues  operating margins  capital expenditures  cash  other financial information  expected legal  arbitration  political  regulatory or clinical results or practices and other such estimates and results. By their nature  such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and assumptions which might cause the actual results  financial condition  performance or achievements of UCB  or industry results  to differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Important factors that could result in such differences include: the global spread and impact of COVID-19  changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  will progress to product approval or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products  which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB's efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover  sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment  including pricing pressure  political and public scrutiny  customer and prescriber patterns or practices  and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes. Finally  a breakdown  cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality  integrity and availability of UCB's data and systems.Given these uncertainties  you should not place undue reliance on any of such forward-looking statements. There can be no guarantee that the investigational or approved products described in this press release will be submitted or approved for sale or for any additional indications or labelling in any market  or at any particular time  nor can there be any guarantee that such products will be or will continue to be commercially successful in the future.UCB is providing this information  including forward-looking statements  only as of the date of this press release and it does not reflect any potential impact from the evolving COVID-19 pandemic  unless indicated otherwise.

Principal ActivitiesBoussard & Gavaudan Holding Limited (“BGHL” or “the Company”)  a closed-ended investment company incorporated under the laws of Guernsey  announces its interim management statement for the period from 1 January to 31 March 2023 (“the period”).The Company is registered with the Dutch Authority for Financial Markets and is listed on the NYSE Euronext Amsterdam  and the London Stock Exchange.During the period  BGHL has invested indirectly in BG Master Fund ICAV (“BG Fund” or “the Fund”)  a Europe-focused multi-strategy hedge fund established in Ireland and authorised by the Central Bank as a Qualified Investor Fund (QIF)  through a dedicated share class of the feeder fund  BG Umbrella Fund Plc. The Fund aims primarily at arbitraging instruments with linear or non-linear pay-offs on equities and credit markets.

PerformanceGlobal equity markets rallied during the period  in particular in Europe with the Euro Stoxx 50® Total Return up +14.2% while in the US the S&P500® Total Return was up +7.5%. The market implied volatility measure VStoxx® dropped from 20.9% to 19.4% and credit markets tightened with the iTraxx Crossover® (S38) moving from 474bps at year-end to 406ps at the end of March.1. BG FundBG Fund (EUR B) contributed negatively for the quarter.1.1. Volatility strategiesMandatory Convertible Bond ArbitrageMandatory convertible bonds contributed slightly positively during the period with performance driven by a general repricing in the market. No new issues were seen albeit the Investment Manager remains confident that supply is coming given the general pivot towards hybrid securities from issuers looking to reduce borrowing costs.Convertible Bond ArbitrageThe period saw convertible bonds giving back some of its previously positive performance over the last few months.In particular  US convertibles suffered mainly because of the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Credit Suisse situations  which caused the US two-year yield to drop very quickly. The sharp drop in rates adversely impacted interest rate hedges as convertible bond prices lagged; however these same hedges have supported the portfolio against previous moves and the Investment Manager expects some normalisation. Pricing for most European CBs was generally soft due to higher credit spreads and very low liquidity in the markets. There was no panic selling  but poor liquidity meant some low prints in very small volumes.The Investment Manager remains very constructive on the positions in the book which continue to carry well. The Investment Manager continues to grow the convertible book and sees a growing number of prospective opportunities in the pipeline.Volatility TradingVolatility trading contributed positively to performance in March as news flow helped to drive vol of vol higher. The Investment Manager traded actively during the period of maximum stress which had led to the creation of some very attractive  albeit relatively short-lived  opportunities. Dispersion strategies continued to carry well.Warrant TradingWarrant arbitrage & SPACs contributed slightly positively.1.2. Equity StrategiesEquity strategies suffered during the quarter. They were initially impacted by a general rally in short hedges as liquid stocks and indices outperformed idiosyncratic positions. Following this  uncertainty caused by the SVB bankruptcy and the Credit Suisse debacle  combined with renewed fears of recession from weaker economic data generated some further market volatility. This particularly impacted special situation positions as the market worried that the unstable macro environment may delay those catalysts. This notwithstanding the core theses remain intact and the Investment Manager expects these positions to realised their embedded value. Despite the market to market volatility the period also saw several positions continue to perform well due to both delivering strong results and where harder catalysts were present.Corporate activity is still much lower than expected in M&A  but as the picture stabilises  and companies adjust to the new interest rate environment  the Investment Manager expects activity to pick up further.1.3. Credit StrategiesCapital Structure ArbitrageCapital structure arbitrage was flat.Credit Long / ShortCredit long / short contributed positively during the period benefiting from the general positive trend.Credit Special SituationsCredit special situations were the main positive contributor to performance this quarter thanks to a combination of ongoing corporate improvements in the portfolio  a restructuring trade which was finalised in March and due to be completed in July as well as active trading around the restructuring of a Swiss bank.1.4. TradingTrading contributed negatively during the period  mostly due to the equity quantitative trading. This strategy has been a very helpful tool for risk managing the portfolio for many years however it has recently been too slow to react to rapid macro developments and the position is being cut pending further assessment.2. Investments Other Than BG FundThe contribution of this investment was flat on the period.Rasaland Investors (“RLI”)Rasaland Investors (“RLI”) RLI is a holding company structured as a private equity fund in terms of fees and organisation and managed by BK Partners. BGHL holds the RLI shares through Campastros  S.L.U.  a wholly-owned holding company in Spain. RLI is dedicated to investing in land  hotels and high-end resort developments in Mexico. RLI’s main asset is a majority interest in ACTUR  a private company owning the land developing assets. ACTUR’s other shareholders are Mexican public institutions.In July 2020  RLI made a cash tender offer to buy back its own shares  for a price per share of US$0.12270. The valuation of BGHL’s investment in RLI shares was marked down on 31 August 2020  using the US$0.12270 per share price as the estimated fair value of the RLI shares. This price represents a circa 80% discount to the latest published NAV per share.IV.

Kalray's next-generation high-performance  low-power DPU processor is at the heart of the project.ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE  EDGE COMPUTING  AND SEMICONDUCTORS - MAJOR CHALLENGES FOR THE COMING DECADESUse cases linked to artificial intelligence (AI) are developing exponentially. Whereas the massive diffusion of AI currently relies heavily on the use of computing resources located in the cloud  there is a growing need for solutions allowing the use of AI in a more reactive  more secure  and less energy hungry way for users. These AI solutions will be deployed in particular in embedded systems as well as local data centers (""edge data centers"") that aim to process data closer to where it is generated  as efficiently as possible.This is known as ""edge computing""  a fast-growing market estimated to be worth several billion Euros1 by 2025 that is comprised of vast areas of the economy such as the telecommunications  new generation of manufacturing  IoT  automotive industry  aerospace  and defense.However  embedded AI and edge computing require new types of processors and new semiconductor technologies to process and accelerate AI algorithms and meet new technological challenges; high performance  but also low power consumption  low latency  and security.The IP-CUBE project  led by Kalray  aims to meet these challenges and create the foundations of a French semiconductor ecosystem in the field of edge computing and embedded AI  based on the national leaders in the field  namely Arteris  Kalray  Secure-IC  and Thales.FINANCING OF STRATEGIC AND SOVEREIGN TECHNOLOGIESThe IP-CUBE project  totaling €36.7M  will directly participate in funding key technology building blocks in this area  particularly Kalray's next-generation Dolomites™ DPU processor for the amount of €10M  Arteris' next-generation NoC (Network-On-Chip)  Secure-IC's specialized IP (intellectual property) development for security  and Thales' RISC-V-based low-power component development.""We are very pleased that the IP-CUBE project has been selected. It will not only allow us to finance a significant part of the development of our 4th generation DPU processor  but also to develop  in collaboration with our partners  the French know-how and technologies in the strategic semiconductor fields around AI applications "" said Eric Baissus  CEO of Kalray.Kalray is the only company in France and Europe to offer DPU (Data Processing Unit) processors  a new type of low-power  high-performance programmable processor  capable of processing data on the fly and multiple applications (AI and others) in parallel  while providing the required security features.As a pioneer in the field  Kalray has developed a unique expertise and an innovative technology based on its patented MPPA® (Massively Parallel Processor Array) architecture  the cornerstone of its DPU processors and acceleration cards. This technological leadership enables Kalray to offer a serious French and European alternative to the predominantly American or Chinese technology players. At the end of 2022  Kalray announced the signing of a framework contract with a major NASDAQ-listed customer to supply its high-performance DPU cards.""In the current geopolitical context  the semiconductor industry has become essential  both in terms of production tools and technological know-how for designing processors. France and Europe need production plants  but they also need companies capable of designing the processors that will be manufactured in these plants  and that will be at the heart of tomorrow's markets. We are delighted with the strong support from France through the IP-CUBE project  and the support from Europe through other collaborative projects  such as the EPI (European Processor Initiative)  in which Kalray is also participating  to help us achieve our ambition of making Kalray the future European Nvidia "" concluded Eric Baissus.1McKinsey – AI-related semiconductor market.Intel: « Edge computing solutions place Internet of Things (IoT) devices  gateways  and computing infrastructure as close as possible to the source of data » by leveraging « Intelligent edge devices [which] offer capabilities like onboard analytics or AI ».NVIDIA: https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2019/10/22/what-is-edge-computing/ABOUT KALRAYKalray is a leading provider of hardware and software technologies and solutions for high-performance  data centric computing markets  from cloud to edge.Kalray provides a full range of products to enable smarter  more efficient  and energy-wise data-intensive applications and infrastructures.

QUARTERLY REPORT AS AT 31 MARCH 2023          THE BIESSE GROUP  ...https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/BIESSE-S-P-A-93574/news/Biesse-S-p-A-QUAR…,The following companies belong to the Biesse Group and are included in the scope of consolidation:BIESSE GROUP PROFILEThe Biesse Group is a multinational manufacturer of integrated lines and machines for the processing of wood  glass  stone  plastics  composites and future materials. Founded in Italy in 1969 and listed on the Euronext Star segment of the Italian Borsa Italiana stock exchange since June 2001  the Biesse Group supports the business development of its customers in the furniture  housing & construction  automotive and aerospace sectors. Today  more than 75% of its consolidated turnover is generated abroad  thanks to an ever-expanding worldwide network with 4 production sites and over 30 showrooms covering more than 160 countries. Thanks to the expertise of over 4 100 employees  leading companies in their sectors and the most respected names in Italian and international design are inspired to unlock the potential of every material.Compared to the consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2022  there are no changes in the scope of consolidation.INTRODUCTIONThe Biesse Group's consolidated quarterly report as at 31 March 2023  unaudited  has been prepared pursuant to Article 154-ter  paragraph 2 of the Consolidated Law on Finance and in accordance with the recognition and measurement criteria established by the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).Accounting standards and recognition criteria are consistent with those of the Financial Statements as at31 December 2022  to which reference should be made. Furthermore  it should be noted that:the quarterly financial statements have been prepared using the discrete approach  according to which the reference period is considered to be a discrete accounting period. In this respect  the income statement items for the period are recognised in the quarterly income statement on an accruals basis;the financial statements underlying the consolidation process are those prepared by subsidiaries with reference to the period ended 31/03/2023  adjusted  where necessary  to align them with the Group's accounting policies.ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE INDICATORSManagement uses some performance indicators  which are not identified as accounting measures under the IFRS (non-GAAP measures)  to better assess the Biesse Group's performance. The criterion applied by the Biesse Group to set these indicators might not be the same as that adopted by other groups  and the indicators might not be comparable with those set by the latter. These performance indicators  which were set in compliance with the Guidelines on performance indicators issued by ESMA/2015/1415 and adopted by CONSOB with its communication No. 92543 of 3 December 2015  refer to performance in the accounting period covered by this Annual Report on Operations and the previous year used for comparison.Performance indicators are to be regarded as complementary to and not a substitute for financial data prepared in accordance with IFRS. Hereafter is a description of the main indicators adopted.Value Added : this indicator is defined as the Profit (Loss) for the year before income taxes  finance income and expense  exchange rate gains and losses  amortisation of intangible assets  depreciation of property  plant and equipment  impairment losses on fixed assets  allocations to provisions for risks and charges  costs and revenues arising from transactions that Management considers as non- recurring relative to the Biesse Group's ordinary operations  as well as personnel expense.: this indicator is defined as the Profit (Loss) for the year before income taxes  finance income and expense  exchange rate gains and losses  amortisation of intangible assets  depreciation of property  plant and equipment  impairment losses on fixed assets  allocations to provisions for risks and charges  costs and revenues arising from transactions that Management considers as non- recurring relative to the Biesse Group's ordinary operations  as well as personnel expense.

I immediately fell in love with the city ” he tells City A.M. in an interview.Sambasivan founded his first firm in London in 2010 before setting up feted fintech firm PrimaryBid in 2016  with the intention of opening up the public markets to retail investors.Looking back a decade and a half later amid a troubling period for London’s financial services sector  does he have any regrets?“I’m getting so tired of all of the UK and City bashing that’s going on. The one point I’ll make very loud and clear is the UK is an incredible place to start a business  especially a fintech business.”Skin in the gameSambasivan’s seems a rare positive voice in the Square Mile these days amid a mood of existential panic  fuelled by a slew of firms seemingly snubbing London’s markets in favour of the Big Apple.He does  of course  have skin in the game. PrimaryBid thrives on a steady stream of capital raising and IPOs in its home market  and he says the slump in IPO activity in both London and beyond has hit the firm.“We are going to be in periods where the markets are up  and when the markets are down. We’re in the period when markets are down. And yes  it isn’t great ” he says.“I’m a banker. So I am a deal junkie at the end of the day and I love to see deals.”PrimaryBid’s investor base also points to how entwined it has become with the capital markets ecosystem in London. The firm added the London Stock Exchange Group to its investor roll in 2019 and has struck an equity and debt issuance deal with the bourse.While London has been hit particularly hard by an IPO downturn – total cash raised fell by 80 per cent in the first quarter compared to last year – he points to the fact the IPO downturn is not a London phenomenon. Globally there were just 299 IPOs in the first quarter of the year raising $21.5bn – down 61 per cent compared to the same period in 2022.And the equity markets downturn has triggered accelerated moves into new areas for PrimaryBid. Rising interest rates and the dearth of IPOs have made debt a more important pillar  and the firm is now eyeing growth with new bond issuance for firms.He says the firm is already in talks with a number of “large  publicly listed corporates” in the London who are scoping out how to utilise its platform for debt issuance.London Stock Exchange saw a dearth of IPOs in the first three months of the year. LSEG is an investor in PrimaryBidPrimaryBid capital markets comebackEven with those new revenue streams  however  Sambasivan says he’s bolshy on the comeback of the firm’s core business in the UK.Regulators and officials at the London Stock Exchange have rolled out a number of regulatory tweaks over the past three years to try and boost the amount of cash flowing into the public markets.Reviews of the listing regime in 2020 and secondary markets last year have been ushered forward at some pace  and central to those has been increasing retail investor participation.Planned reforms fall squarely in line with PrimaryBids’ ambitions  he says.“Public markets are there to kind of democratise access and wealth creation… but it really wasn’t happening outside of the secondary markets ” he adds. “PrimaryBid was formed with this notion that the markets are either public or they’re not – you can’t have it both ways.”He says crucially the appetite for greater retail investor participation in the public markets in the UK is coming from firms themselves rather than investors. While volatility on the public markets has caused firms to issue less over the past 18 months  “when they do  they want to do retail”.That appetite for retail is also now growing internationally. PrimaryBid has integrated its technology into European exchange Euronext and in 2021 allowed retail investors to participate in the New York float of London members’ group Soho House.Stateside expansionAs a number of big name firms including Reddit and Arm eye potential listings in New York  he says PrimaryBid could help tap into a hefty retail following in the UK.Those comments are to be expected from a firm that is eyeing big growth plans in the US. But  he insists  it will be a “focused expansion” rather than “diluting anything we’re doing here in the UK”.PrimaryBid  Sambasivan says  is one firm that will not be ditching its London hub in favour of New York. Even as negative headlines abound over the flood of firms away from the Capital  he says PrimaryBid is as positive as ever over London’s prospects.“I hear the negativity  but I don’t subscribe to it. If anything  it’s gotten better ” he says.“From where I sit  if I was to start over today  this would be the place I would do it.”,negative,0.07,0.0,0.93,mixed,0.23,0.06,0.71,True,English,"['UK bashing', 'incredible place', 'PrimaryBid chief', 'Anand Sambasivan', 'business', 'London', 'large, publicly listed corporates', 'Arm eye potential listings', 'The Wall Street banker', 'greater retail investor participation', 'London Stock Exchange Group', 'European exchange Euronext', 'rare positive voice', 'Rising interest rates', 'financial services sector', 'past three years', 'new revenue streams', 'London members’ group', 'new bond issuance', 'seven year stint', 'first three months', 'New York float', 'City A.M.', 'big growth plans', 'capital markets ecosystem', 'debt issuance deal', 'big name firms', 'equity markets downturn', 'PrimaryBid capital markets', 'fintech firm PrimaryBid', 'past 18 months', 'Big Apple', 'capital raising', 'financial crisis', 'deal junkie', 'new areas', 'investor base', 'investor roll', 'young banker', 'IPO downturn', 'first quarter', 'hefty retail', 'incredible place', 'Credit Suisse', 'next move', 'two options', 'temporary basis', 'one point', 'fintech business', 'Square Mile', 'existential panic', 'steady stream', 'home market', 'IPO activity', '80 per cent', 'important pillar', 'regulatory tweaks', 'listing regime', 'Planned reforms', 'PrimaryBids’ ambitions', 'democratise access', 'wealth creation', 'Soho House', 'Stateside expansion', 'focused expansion', 'negative headlines', 'public markets', 'secondary markets', 'retail investors', 'last year', 'first firm', 'troubling period', 'same period', 'London phenomenon', 'London hub', 'PrimaryBid chief', 'total cash', 'core business', 'one firm', 'Anand Sambasivan', 'two firms', 'UK bashing', 'wake', 'Cities', 'venture', 'decision', 'love', 'interview', 'intention', 'regrets', 'Skin', 'game', 'mood', 'slew', 'favour', 'IPOs', 'slump', 'periods', 'end', 'day', 'deals', 'bourse', 'fact', 'moves', 'dearth', 'talks', 'number', 'platform', 'LSEG', 'comeback', 'Regulators', 'officials', 'amount', 'Reviews', 'pace', 'notion', 'appetite', 'volatility', 'technology', 'Reddit', 'comments', 'flood']",2023-05-11,2023-05-12,cityam.com

Part 2A and Part 26 enact in Ireland domestic rules in line with Directive 2013/34/EU (the “EU Accounting Directive (2013)”) and apply to large Irish incorporated companies  like the Company  that are involved in the exploration  discovery  development  and extraction of minerals. DTR 4.3A imposes equivalent requirements on issuers  like the Company  admitted to trading on the London Stock Exchange that are similarly involved in the exploration  development and extraction of minerals.About Kenmare Resources plcKenmare Resources plc is an Irish incorporated company with a premium listing on the London Stock Exchange and a secondary listing on Euronext Dublin. Kenmare operates the Moma Titanium Minerals Mine (the “Moma Mine”)  which is located on the northern coast of Mozambique. Moma is one of the world’s largest producers of minerals sands products  accounting for production of approximately 7% of global titanium feedstocks and supplying to customers operating in over 15 countries. The Group’s products are key raw materials  ultimately consumed in everyday quality-of-life products such as paints  plastics  and ceramic tiles.The Group consists of the parent company (Kenmare Resources plc) and its subsidiary undertakings. The mining operations at the Moma Mine are carried out by the Mozambique branch of Kenmare Moma Mining (Mauritius) Limited (“KMML”) and downstream processing is undertaken by the Mozambique branch of Kenmare Moma Processing (Mauritius) Limited (“KMPL”)  both of which are wholly-owned subsidiary undertakings of the Company. KMML and KMPL account for 100% of the Group’s turnover and 99% of the Group’s total assets. Therefore  all revenues and operating costs of the Group’s mining and processing operations are recorded by KMML and KMPL within the same tax jurisdiction  namely Mozambique.The parent company  Kenmare Resources plc  conducts no direct exploration or mining activities. The Group’s corporate costs are recorded by the parent company.Scope of reportDisclosure of payments to governments is required in respect of payments arising from the exploration  discovery  development and extraction of minerals; the payments included within this report therefore relate to the Group’s mining and processing activities at the Moma Mine in Mozambique.Groups are required to prepare a consolidated report disclosing payments made by the parent company and its subsidiary undertakings. Accordingly  this report reflects payments made by the Group companies conducting mining and processing activities  namely KMML and KMPL. The Group owns 100% of these entities and the amounts reflect 100% of the payments made by these subsidiary undertakings.For a broader discussion of the Group’s payments to governments and its contribution to its host communities  please see the Group’s 2022 Sustainability Report  available on the Company’s website at www.kenmareresources.com/investors/reports-and-presentationsPaymentsThe payments disclosed in this report are on a cash basis.The payments made to governments are required to be analysed into the following categories:• Production entitlements - this category includes the host government’s share of production  which is usually outlined in a production sharing agreement. In 2022  the Group did not make relevant payments in this category.• Taxes - this category includes taxes paid to governments on income  profits or production arising from the Group’s exploration  discovery  development and extraction of minerals. Taxes levied on consumption such as value added taxes  personal income taxes and sales taxes are excluded. KMML is subject to a corporation tax rate of 35% of the taxable profits of its Mozambique branch. Taxable profits of the branch are calculated by reference to the cash costs of producing Heavy Mineral Concentrate (“HMC”) net of allowable tax deductions and increased by a defined margin.KMML’s Mozambique branch produces one product from its mining activities  namely HMC. HMC is sold to KMPL  which processes it into finished products (ilmenite  zircon  rutile and mineral sands concentrate)  which are exported worldwide to third party customers. The cash costs of mining include the costs of mine face preparation  dredging and dry mining operations  Wet Concentrator Plant operations  rehabilitation and support services.The margin applied to the cash costs of mining is stipulated in the Mineral Licensing Contract  dated 21 January 2002. The contract is between KMML and the Ministry of Mineral Resources and Energy (MIREME) of the Republic of Mozambique  acting for and on behalf of the Government of the Republic of Mozambique  which details the terms and conditions for the exploration  development and production of heavy minerals in the areas of Moma  Congolone and Quinga. The margin is determined by dividing the prices for sale of finished products to third party customers earned by KMPL in the year by the prices earned in the prior year  adjusted for inflation and applying this factor to the prior year margin. For the fiscal year ending 31 December 2022 the margin was 66.8%.KMPL has the benefit of operating within an Industrial Free Zone (“IFZ”) and as an IFZ company  it is exempted from corporation tax.• Royalties – this category includes payments to a government for the rights to extract minerals or other materials. Typically amounts are levied based on production levels or revenues. KMML is subject to a mining royalty of 3% based on HMC sold to KMPL. The royalty is calculated by multiplying the cash costs of producing HMC  plus the margin as detailed above  by 3%.KMPL is subject to a revenue royalty of 1% on revenue recognised.• Dividends - this category includes dividend payments other than dividends paid to a government as an ordinary shareholder of the Company or one of its subsidiary undertakings. In 2022  the Group did not make relevant payments in this category.• Bonuses - this category includes bonuses paid to a government for and in consideration of signature  discovery  production  awards  grants and transfers of extraction rights and production bonuses. In 2022  the Group did not make relevant payments in this category.• Fees – this category includes licence fees  rental fees  entry fees and other considerations for mining licences or concessions.• Infrastructure improvements – this category includes payments to governments for infrastructure other than in circumstances where the infrastructure is expected to be primarily dedicated to operational activities throughout its useful life. Payments that form part of the Group’s social investment activities (which are primarily organised and administered by Kenmare Moma Development Association) are excluded. Such payments would include contributions in respect of local schools  healthcare or community facilities  or improvements to the general environment of local communities.Government“Government” means any national  regional or local authority of a country  and includes a department  agency or undertaking that is a subsidiary undertaking where the authority is the parent undertaking.All payments referred to this report are made to the Government of Mozambique or its agencies; in particular  they are made to Autoridade Tributária Unidade dos Grandes Contribuintes–Nampula  a department of the Mozambican tax authority.Analysis by project/entityAn analysis of payments by project is required where payments are attributable to specific projects. Projects are defined as operational activities which are governed by a single contract  licence  lease  concession or similar legal agreement  and form the basis for payment liabilities with a government. Where agreements are substantially interconnected in operating and geographical terms  with substantially similar terms  those agreements should be treated as a single project. Payments may be disclosed at an entity level where payments are made in respect of obligations imposed at that entity level rather than at a project level. Payments below are disclosed at the entity level for KMML and KMPL  which between them operate the Moma Mine  which is treated as one project for purposes of this Report.MaterialityUnder Part 2A and Part 26  a payment need not be disclosed if it is a single payment of less than the equivalent of €100 000 or a series of related payments in a single year whose total is less than the equivalent of €100 000. Under DTR 4.3A  a payment need not be disclosed if it is a single payment of less than the equivalent of £86 000 or a series of related payments in a single year whose total is less than the equivalent of £86 000.Currency and roundingAll monetary amounts in this report refer to United States dollars unless otherwise indicated. The amounts shown in this report have been rounded to the nearest $1 000.Payments to governments – 2022Production entitlements Taxes Royalties Dividends Bonuses Fees Infrastructure improvements Total $’000 $’000 $’000 $’000 $’000 $’000 $’000 $’000 Country summary Government of Mozambique - 6 106 10 674 - - 409 - 17 189 Total - 6 106 10 674 - - 409 - 17 189 Entity report KMML - 6 106 5 699 - - 409 - 12 214 KMPL - - 4 975 - - - - 4 975 Total - 6 106 10 674 - - 409 - 17 189This report for Kenmare Resources plc (registered number 37550) was approved by the Directors of the Company on 10 May 2023 and signed on their behalf byMichael Carvill Tom Hickey Director DirectorFor further information  please contact:Kenmare Resources plcJeremy Dibb / Michael StarkeInvestor Relationsir@kenmareresources.comTel: +353 1 671 0411Mob: +353 87 943 036Murray (PR advisor)Paul O’Kanepokane@murraygroup.ieTel: +353 1 498 0300Mob: +353 86 609 0221About Kenmare ResourcesKenmare Resources plc is one of the world's largest producers of mineral sands products.

This robust trend is growing stronger as the use of Chinese drones  with cyber security and transparency standards that have been called into question  is being forbidden or restricted. Various companies  particularly in Japan  have also chosen the ANAFI USA for its performance and security.The ANAFI Ai  released for sale from the first quarter of 2022  supported by a gradual promotion strategy  is continuing to highlight its innovative features in an environment with stronger competition. Supported by the Tech Days and the Enterprise Loan Program rolled out internationally  the pre-commercial phases for assessment by businesses are progressing and the ANAFI Ai has responded to some initial invitations to tender in several industries.Photogrammetry businessThe photogrammetry business generated €7.2m of revenues  with annual growth of 7% (+5% at constant exchange rates). While the flagship products in the geomatics and mapping sectors are still the main contributors to revenues  growth is being driven by sales of the most recent business solutions.A core pillar for growth in 2023  the marketing of complementary equipment  launched at the end of 2022 to extend data collection for photogrammetry to include new mobile devices (smartphones or tablets)  has started up effectively  particularly for the “public services and infrastructure” markets.In addition to its constant focus on the performance of its range of solutions  illustrated by frequent updates and improvements  the photogrammetry business is further strengthening its commercial strategy with businesses. Illustrating this  a new sales team dedicated exclusively to key accounts has been set up.OutlookParrot is taking action to continue moving forward with its growth in 2023.

This robust trend is growing stronger as the use of Chinese drones  with cyber security and transparency standards that have been called into question  is being forbidden or restricted. Various companies  particularly in Japan  have also chosen the ANAFI USA for its performance and security.The ANAFI Ai  released for sale from the first quarter of 2022  supported by a gradual promotion strategy  is continuing to highlight its innovative features in an environment with stronger competition. Supported by the Tech Days and the Enterprise Loan Program rolled out internationally  the pre-commercial phases for assessment by businesses are progressing and the ANAFI Ai has responded to some initial invitations to tender in several industries.Photogrammetry businessThe photogrammetry business generated €7.2m of revenues  with annual growth of 7% (+5% at constant exchange rates). While the flagship products in the geomatics and mapping sectors are still the main contributors to revenues  growth is being driven by sales of the most recent business solutions.A core pillar for growth in 2023  the marketing of complementary equipment  launched at the end of 2022 to extend data collection for photogrammetry to include new mobile devices (smartphones or tablets)  has started up effectively  particularly for the “public services and infrastructure” markets.In addition to its constant focus on the performance of its range of solutions  illustrated by frequent updates and improvements  the photogrammetry business is further strengthening its commercial strategy with businesses. Illustrating this  a new sales team dedicated exclusively to key accounts has been set up.OutlookParrot is taking action to continue moving forward with its growth in 2023.

GOOD PROSPECTS FOR THE NEW FISCAL YEAR 2023-24.Q4 fiscal activity remained very dynamic. After an exceptional Q4 21-22 with 175.8% growth  Q4 22-23 sales were better than expected at €7.5M vs. €8.4M in 21-22. For the full fiscal year  which grew by 66.3% in 21-22  sales rose by a further 13.3% to €51.2M vs. €45.2M a year earlier  whereas they were expected to be close to €50M.Sales growth was driven by toys  watches  musical instruments and walkie-talkies  thanks to new products under the Group's own brands and licensed products.Over the fiscal year  sales rose by 17% in the French market  which accounted for 38% of total sales. International sales are also growing  both on traditional networks and on the Internet  and have significant potential.The Group continued its communication campaign in Europe during the quarter  exceeding one billion digital impressions over its fiscal year.Q1 22-23  which was already up 78.2% in 21-22  is expected to be close to this level in the new year  and augurs a new year of profitable growth for Lexibook. The Group could benefit from the current level of the U.S. dollar if it remains at this level for the rest of the year and from the improvement in international freight conditions to improve its margins.Lexibook (ISIN FR0000033599) announces today its turnover (unaudited) for the period ending March 31  2023 (period from April 1er 2022 to March 31  2023).Consolidated revenues (M€) 2021/2022 2022/2023 Var 1st quarter 5 08 6 93 +36 4% Of which FOB 1 31 2 22 Of which Non FOB 3 77 4 71 2nd quarter 9 82 13 4 +36 5% Of which FOB 2 96 4 32 Of which Non FOB 6 86 9 08 3rd quarter 21 86 23 41 +7 1% Of which FOB 2 58 0 72 Of which Non FOB 19 28 22 69 4th quarter 8 44 7 49 -11 3% Of which FOB 1 35 1 87 Of which Non FOB 7 09 5 62 Total 12 months 45 2 51 2 +13 3%After a very dynamic first half of fiscal year 22-23 with growth of 36.4% and a third quarter 22-23 also up 7%  the last quarter of the fiscal year  which was already up 175.8% in 21-22 due to the saturation of the ports at the end of 2021  was higher than the Group's expectations at €7.49M vs €8.44M in 21-22 (-11.3%). This sustained level of activity is linked to the excellent consumption of Lexibook products during the Christmas season in all the countries where the Group operates  and in most of its main segments. Customers restocked on discontinued products at Christmas and put in place a wider assortment than in previous years on new permanent ranges.For the full year  sales reached €51.2 million  up 13.3%  a historic level for the Group. FOB sales (sales invoiced directly from HK on FOB HK deliveries by full containers) and non-FOB sales are both up  reflecting the popularity of the Group's products among international distributors.Over the full fiscal year  France accounted for 38% of sales and grew by 17%. The international market is also driving growth and has significant growth potential.In terms of products  sales growth was driven by toys  watches  musical instruments and walkie-talkies  thanks to new products under the Group's own brands and licensed products. Sales growth was spectacular in toys  up 29%  and now representing 44% of total sales  with the success of the Powerman® robot ranges  Crosslander® radio-controlled vehicles  as well as educational products and electronic games. Alarm clocks  audio and music products are also particularly popular  with growth of +12%  +10% and +10% respectively.Licensed products also contributed to this growth  both on existing  very dynamic licenses such as The Snow Queen  Patrol  Spiderman and on new licenses such as Super Mario  Miraculous  and Harry Potter.Finally  the Group's digitalization is bearing fruit: digital sales are up sharply both in France and in the various European markets  thanks in particular to a massive  Europe-wide digital marketing campaign on the Group's new products. This campaign generated more than one billion digital impressions of the Group's products  mainly in Europe  and helped to strengthen the Lexibook brand's reputation to an unprecedented level.PerspectivesThe Group presented its 2023 collections to international retailers and the response to the new products was very positive. The listings for the 2023 Christmas campaign are excellent and suggest that the 2023-24 fiscal year will be in line with 22-23. Q1 fiscal 22-23 was up 36% on Q1 fiscal 21-22  which was itself up 78%. The benchmark is therefore high for fiscal Q1 2023-24. Nevertheless  the order book suggests a similar level of activity to last year in Q1 2023-24 and the Group intends to continue its momentum of profitable growth this year.Several extensions of license agreements are being finalized to extend current contracts into new areas  which could have an accelerating effect on the Group over the next few years.The Group could also benefit from the current level of the U.S. dollar if it remains at this level for the rest of the year and from the improvement in international freight conditions to improve its margins.Financial calendar 2022/2023Annual results to March 31  2023: June 30  2023About LexibookLexibook®  owner of more than 40 registered brands such as Powerman®  Decotech®  Karaoke Micro Star®  Chessman®  Cyber Arcade®  Lexitab®  iParty®  FlashBoom®  etc.  Lexibook® is the leader in smart electronic entertainment products for children.

Revenue from this business was up 9.8% to €223.9 million  in line with the group's forecasts for the first quarter.The Real Estate Development business posted revenue of €11.4 million compared to €12.7 million in the first quarter of 2022. This business is still impacted by longer administrative delays  which in turn is pushing back the building of these new programs.The Land Development business was very active during the first quarter with revenue of €7.2 million  up 12.5% compared to last year.Revenue from the B2C Renovation business amounted to €13.0 million  up 1.6%. This production includes:- Revenue from the “general contractor” business  recognized as renovation contracts progress (average selling price of around €100k excluding tax)  which is down slightly (-1.8%).- Revenue from the intermediated business  consisting of commissions collected via the franchisee network  which is up sharply (+26.3%) as this sales network continues to expand.Finally  as expected  the B2B Renovation business was down 6.5% to €23.0 million.Order intake for the first quarter of 2023In terms of sales momentum  the market environment was complex during the quarter  disrupted as it was by inflation  tighter financing conditions  and rising interest rates.Home Building BusinessThough the group is impacted by worsening market conditions  it is continuing its rigorous policy aimed at restoring margins. The average selling price for the first three months of the year was €166.1k excluding tax compared to €154.5k excluding tax at the end of December 2022.Hyperinflation in construction costs seems to be slowing down or even stabilizing for certain materials. Nonetheless  the group remains vigilant and is constantly adjusting its selling prices to accommodate for rising construction costs.In this disrupted environment  the order intake  at March 31st  2023  represented revenue of €174.5 million  down 24.7% in value (-32.8% in number  with the market).Land and Real Estate Development BusinessThe Real Estate Development business backlog  at March 31 st  2023  was €87.8 million and the total potential inventory to be delivered represented revenue of €297.5 million  i.e. 1 365 housing units. Even as the market continues to contract  the group's resilience is bolstered by its positioning in the high-quality home ownership and subsidized housing markets as well as its presence in Ile-de-France  Aquitaine  and Western France.For the Land Development business  the order book (unreserved inventory) stood at €21.9 million  representing 298 lots. This level of activity reflects wider trends in the construction market.B2C Renovation BusinessB2C renovation is being driven by strong momentum from franchises. The “General contractor” business amounted to €10.6 million for the quarter compared to €12.6 million for the same period last year. Order intake from the intermediated business was up sharply to €25.9 million compared to €19.4 million. The franchise network continues to expand in line with the group's targets.B2B Renovation BusinessSales for B2B renovations are still being monitored and amounted to €17.8 million for the period. Actions to restructure and restore margins continue in accordance with the announced action plan.Outlook for 2023The group benefiting from high order intake in the previous year in the Home Building business forecasts 2023 production to grow despite the decline in order intake that began in 2022.It will continue to develop its other areas of diversification (B2C Renovation  Land Development  and Real Estate Development). B2C Renovation stands to gain from measures put in place to grow this business and from overall market trends.Given the expected outlook in each of the business segments and the rigorous actions put in place to turn around the B2B Renovation business  the group remains confident in its ability to improve its current operating margin in 2023.Thanks to its sound financial structure  the Hexaom Group will continue to gain market shares in all its businesses and consolidate its position as a major player in the French housing industry.Next press release: 2023 Q2 Revenue  August 3rd  2023  after market close.ABOUT THE GROUPSince 1919  five generations of the same family have successively taken over the helm of Hexaom  a group that drives and federates an ecosystem of 46 brands and subsidiaries with complementary expertise.

Occupancy rate remained high at 95.7%  up 100 basis points year-on-year.On the leasing front  highlights of the period included the 7th Retailer Day event held by Klépierre in Paris on March 22  bringing together more than 200 banners  and underscoring their ambition to open stores and enlarge their presence in the Group’s malls.This event provided a forum for productive discussions with retailers and gave the Group the opportunity to promote its recently completed projects  such as the full renovation and 11 600 sq.m. extension of Créteil Soleil (France) - that brought the mall to a total leasable area of 135 000 sq.m. - and the 16 700 sq.m. canopied extension at Gran Reno in Bologna (Italy)  which now boasts a retail offering covering a total of 53 000 sq.m.Current and future projects were also presented  including the extension of Grand Place (France) with 30 new stores  the renovations of Alexandrium in Rotterdam (Netherlands) and Le Gru in Turin (Italy)  and the Maremagnum rooftop terrace development in Barcelona (Spain) with Time Out Market.RevenueKlépierre’s total revenue for the three-month period ended March 31  2023 amounted to €371.5 million  up 3.3% compared to first-quarter 2022.Over the first three months of 2023  gross rental income amounted to €287.1 million  reflecting the bounce-back in retailer sales and footfall  dynamic leasing activity and the rebound in variable revenues and other income.Net rental income amounted to €228.5 million  up 6.2% compared to first-quarter 2022 adjusted for developments and disposals completed in 2022. This growth was notably driven by a 5.75% positive indexation effect.Service charge income and management and development fees were in line with 2022 at €84.4 million.INVESTMENTSOverall  total capital expenditure invested over the period amounted to €38 million.Regarding development  Klépierre focused on its main committed projects to strengthen the leadership of its shopping malls in their catchment areas  notably: the Grand Place extension in Grenoble (France) and the rooftop restructuring at Maremagnum in Barcelona (Spain).Grand Place extension (Grenoble  France)The construction of the 16 200 sq.m. extension of Grand Place (Grenoble  France) which started in May 2022 is expected to be delivered by the end of 2023 and will bring the total leasable area of the mall to 75 000 sq.m. Pre-leasing currently stands at 93% of the projected net rental income  with leading brands such as Primark - that will open its first store in the region – Snipes  JOTT and NYX  and a food area upgraded to the latest standards of Klépierre’s Destination Food® strategy. Yield on cost for this project is projected at c.8%.Maremagnum (Barcelona  Spain)The Maremagnum rooftop will host the first Time Out Market in Spain and the second in Europe  making it the new must-visit shopping and dining destination in Barcelona. The opening is planned for 2024  in time for the America's Cup. In addition  the recent enlargement of Inditex brands Stradivarius  Pull & Bear  Bershka and Lefties  has provided fresh retail impetus for the mall. Yield on cost for this project is projected at 13.5%.Other recent developmentsIn 2022 and 2023  Klépierre redeveloped several assets to strengthen their leadership in their respective catchment areas. These included the extension of Gran Reno opened in July 2022  translated into strong footfall (up 42% since opening compared to 2019) and retailer sales increases (€74 million of additional retailer sales since opening).Works at Campania (Naples  Italy) has attracted new brands and enabled the Group to broaden the retail mix  notably characterized by the opening of a Primark megastore. Operational indicators were on the rise in first-quarter 2023  with retailer sales up 10% and footfall up 21% compared to first-quarter 2019.Similarly  at Nave de Vero (Venice  Italy) the opening of Primark boosted footfall that increased by 24% compared to 2019  while at Centre Deux (France) the revamping of the mall and the welcoming of Primark translated into a 45% growth in footfall in March 2023 compared to March 2022 or 16% compared to 2019.These solid performances illustrate the relevance of Klépierre’s extensions and development projects and its know-how in terms of leasing management.DEBT AND FINANCINGAs of March 31  2023  consolidated net debt stood at €7 585 million compared to €7 479 million at the end of 2022  almost stable despite the payment of the interim cash dividend on March 30  2023.

Moreover  Klépierre is encouraging all employees in sponsorship programs to support local communities.“Promoting sustainable lifestyles”To leverage Klépierre’s impact  each mall will showcase the responsible products and services of its retailers and assess the CSR engagement of tenants before entering into leases. One specific unit to new local  responsible concepts in the Top-50 shopping centers will be dedicated. Lastly  events to promote sustainable lifestyles and players committed to the low-carbon transition will be organized to raise visitor’ awareness.DISTRIBUTIONThe proposed €1.75 distribution(5) for fiscal year 2022 is split into two installments:An interim cash dividend of €0.87 paid on March 30  2023; and The balance of €0.88 per share to be paid on July 11  2023  comprising: A €0.04 per share “SIIC” dividend; and A €0.84 per share distribution of share premiums qualifying as an equity repayment within the meaning of Article 112-1 of the French Tax Code (Code général des impôts).OUTLOOKConsidering the performance of the first quarter  Klépierre is confirming its 2023 guidance and expects to generate net current cash flow per share of €2.35(3)  representing a growth of 5% compared to the adjusted figure for 2022 of €2.24 (i.e.  €2.62 restated for €0.30 in reversals of provisions and for €0.08 in cash flow generated by divested assets).This guidance assumes (i) retailer sales maintain their momentum  (ii) stable occupancy and (iii) a stable collection rate compared to 2022. It also factors in the impact on costs of the projected inflation in Europe for 2023 and current funding cost levels.AGENDA July 7  2023 Ex-distribution date for the final dividend July 11  2023 Final dividend payment August 1  2023 First-half 2023 earnings (after market close) INVESTOR RELATIONS CONTACTS MEDIA CONTACTS Paul Logerot  Group Head of IR and Financial Communications+33 (0)7 50 66 05 63 — paul.logerot@klepierre.comTanguy Phelippeau  IR Officer+33 (0)7 72 09 29 57 —tanguy.phelippeau@klepierre.com Hélène Salmon  Group Head of Corporate and Internal Communications+33 (0)1 40 67 55 16 – helene.salmon@klepierre.comDelphine Granier  Taddeo+33 (0)6 33 05 48 50 – teamklepierre@taddeo.frABOUT KLÉPIERREKlépierre is the European leader in shopping malls  combining property development and asset management skills.

Pre-leasing currently stands at 93% of the projected net rental income  with leading brands such as Primark - that will open its first store in the region – Snipes  JOTT and NYX  and a food area upgraded to the latest standards of Klépierre’s Destination Food® strategy. Yield on cost for this project is projected at c.8%.Maremagnum (Barcelona  Spain)The Maremagnum rooftop will host the first Time Out Market in Spain and the second in Europe  making it the new must-visit shopping and dining destination in Barcelona.

In addition  the recent enlargement of Inditex brands Stradivarius  Pull & Bear  Bershka and Lefties  has provided fresh retail impetus for the mall. Yield on cost for this project is projected at 13.5%.Other recent developmentsIn 2022 and 2023  Klépierre redeveloped several assets to strengthen their leadership in their respective catchment areas. These included the extension of Gran Reno opened in July 2022  translated into strong footfall (up 42% since opening compared to 2019) and retailer sales increases (€74 million of additional retailer sales since opening).Works at Campania (Naples  Italy) has attracted new brands and enabled the Group to broaden the retail mix  notably characterized by the opening of a Primark megastore.

This issue  affecting all of the HAE market  has since resolvedContinue to anticipate low single digit growth in annual revenues from RUCONEST® in 2023Continued significant investments made in leniolisib launch preparations and organizational structureOverall cash balance of US$184.8 million at the end of the quarterLEIDEN  Netherlands  May 11  2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Pharming Group N.V. (""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (Euronext: PHARM/Nasdaq: PHAR) presents its preliminary  unaudited financial report for the first quarter ended March 31  2023.Chief Executive Officer  Sijmen de Vries commented:""In the first quarter of 2023  we reached an important milestone with the approval and launch of Joenja® (leniolisib)  the first and only approved treatment for patients with APDS in the United States. With this approval  U.S.-based patients living with APDS now have access to the medication to normalize their underlying immune function  and Pharming is one step closer to its goal of becoming a leading global rare disease company dedicated to patient communities with unmet medical needs.The launch of Joenja® is off to a strong start. In April  we announced that the first commercial product had been shipped to patients with payor reimbursement and we can confirm that we now have 23 patients on paid therapy.Turning to RUCONEST®  as we guided on our 2022 full year results call on March 16  we continue to anticipate low single digit revenue growth with quarterly fluctuations. In the first quarter  there were a number of fluctuations that impacted RUCONEST® revenues and the HAE market across acute and prophylactic products. These factors were mainly due to disruptions in reimbursement for some patients on government insurance programs  which delayed shipments.These impacts to the business have since resolved and we can confirm that we have seen a recovery and catch up in revenues. Additionally  we are observing strong underlying in-market demand for RUCONEST® and have a high number of new patient enrollments in the U.S. as we entered the second quarter of this year.Looking ahead  we continue to progress leniolisib through regulatory pathways in Europe  the U.K. and Japan and expect a positive opinion from the European regulator in the second half of 2023  with Europe and U.K. approvals following approximately two months later.We also began the first of two pediatric clinical trials for children with APDS  whom we believe account for some 25% of U.S.-based APDS patients. The first trial for ages 4 to 11 began in February with the second  for children ages 1 to 6  to follow in the third quarter of this year. These pediatric trials  as well as the development of further leniolisib indications  will add to Pharming's pipeline.Finally  with a focus on rare disease assets  we are continuously investigating in-licensing and acquisition opportunities which can further enhance our portfolio.""First Quarter and subsequent highlightsCommercialized assetsU.S. FDA Approval of Joenja® (leniolisib) – the first and only treatment approved for APDSOn March 24  2023  Pharming announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Joenja® (leniolisib) for the treatment of activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kδ) syndrome (APDS) in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older. Joenja®  an oral  selective PI3Kδ inhibitor  is the first and only treatment approved in the U.S. for APDS. The FDA evaluated the New Drug Application (NDA) for Joenja® under priority review and approved the drug based on findings from a multinational  triple-blind  placebo-controlled  randomized Phase II/III clinical trial.With the approval of Joenja®  as a treatment for primary immunodeficiency  the FDA granted Pharming a priority review voucher (""PRV""). Pursuant to the terms of Pharming's 2019 exclusive license agreement with Novartis for leniolisib  Novartis has the right to purchase the PRV from Pharming for a small minority share of the value of the PRV. Pursuant to the agreement with Novartis  the first commercial sale of Joenja® in the second quarter of 2023 triggered a US$10 million milestone payment by Pharming to Novartis and the regulatory approval for APDS triggered a US$0.5 million milestone payment by Pharming to another party in the first quarter of 2023. Pharming is obligated to make certain additional milestone payments to Novartis totaling up to US$190 million upon the achievement of leniolisib sales milestones and tiered royalty payments to Novartis calculated as low-teen to high-teen percentages of leniolisib net sales.Additional information on the PRV  as well as milestone and royalty payments can be found in our 2022 Annual Report or in the Form 20-F filed with the SEC.Joenja® U.S. Commercial LaunchBased on available literature  Pharming estimates that over 1 500 patients are affected by APDS in the U.S.  Europe  U.K.  Japan  Canada and Australia. Pharming has already identified over 500 of these patients  of which approximately 200 are U.S.-based. Of that  approximately 75% are U.S.-based patients over the age of 12 and are currently eligible for treatment with Joenja®.The first commercial shipments of Joenja® to APDS patient in the U.S.  with payor reimbursements  were delivered approximately two weeks following FDA approval. Since launching in early April  Joenja® has 23 patients on paid therapy. We have received enrollments from significantly more patients who are in the process of payor reimbursement authorizations which have been proceeding as expected. The first sales of Joenja® will be booked and reported in the second quarter of 2023.We anticipate providing updates on our commercial outlook for Joenja® in the second half of 2023.RUCONEST® marketed for the treatment of acute HAE attacksIn the first quarter of 2023  RUCONEST® revenues were US$42.5 million  a 9% decline compared to the same quarter last year.The decrease in overall revenues were primarily due to temporary disruptions in reimbursement for some patients on government insurance programs  which impacted the overall HAE market across all acute and prophylactic products. As a result  shipments to these patients were delayed and impacted February sales in particular. The HAE market disruptions seen in the first quarter have since resolved and we have seen a recovery in sales.We are therefore maintaining our full-year outlook for low single digit growth in RUCONEST® revenues for 2023.Underlying in-market demand for RUCONEST® continued to be strong  including a high number of new patient enrollments in the first quarter.Strategic Highlights - regulatory and clinical updatesLeniolisib for APDSPharming made significant progress in the quarter towards our objective of obtaining regulatory approvals for leniolisib for APDS in additional key markets and for pediatric patients  and to identify additional indications for development of leniolisib beyond APDS.EEA and U.K. marketIn February 2023  Pharming announced that the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Human Medicinal Products (CHMP) decided to shift its assessment of the Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) for leniolisib to a standard review timetable. The list of questions received by Pharming from EMA included a request to submit updated data from the ongoing long-term extension study collected after the interim analysis included in the original MAA. As previously announced  we anticipate responding to the CHMP's list of questions in May 2023 and expect that the CHMP will issue its opinion on the leniolisib MAA in the second half of 2023. We anticipate that European marketing authorisation will follow approximately two months later.In the U.K.  and in line with the European Commission Decision Reliance Procedure (ECDRP)  we intend to file the leniolisib dossier to the U.K.'s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) within five days of a positive CHMP opinion; expected in the second half of 2023.JapanOn March 9  2023  we filed an Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) application with the Ministry of Health  Labor and Welfare (MHLW) in Japan. We expect to begin a clinical trial in Japan in second quarter of 2023 for APDS patients aged 12 and older. We currently anticipate marketing leniolisib in Japan directly following regulatory approval.Pediatric clinical trialIn February 2023  as part of Pharming's Pediatric Investigational Plan (PIP)  the Company announced that the first patient had been enrolled in its Phase III clinical trial evaluating the investigational drug leniolisib in children with APDS  at sites in the United States  Europe  and Japan. The single-arm  open-label  multinational clinical trial will evaluate the safety  tolerability  and efficacy of leniolisib in approximately 15 children aged 4 to 11 years who have a confirmed APDS diagnosis.The second pediatric clinical trial for patients 1 to 6 years of age is scheduled to commence in the third quarter of 2023 and is also part of the PIP for leniolisib as a treatment for APDS in children.Leniolisib for additional indications (PI3Kδ platform)As announced in our Joenja® approval conference call on March 27  we have commenced working towards prioritizing other indications where leniolisib has the potential to deliver value for patients. PI3Kδ has been identified as an important factor in a variety of disease states  and leniolisib has demonstrated an attractive  long-term efficacy  safety and tolerability profile in clinical trials conducted in both healthy volunteers and patients. This provides a solid basis for our plans for the investigation and investment in further leniolisib indications. We are exploring further indications and will update the market later on this year.Pre-Clinical PipelineOTL-105We anticipate providing further updates as we move towards preparing an Investigational New Drug (IND) filing. If the data from pre-clinical HAE animal studies meet scientific requirements  then we expect to start IND-enabling pre-clinical studies in 2023.PompeBased on our preclinical investigations and evaluations for potential differentiating features of the product candidate  it has been decided that the further development of this asset will be discontinued.Other events during the quarterOn March 12 and 13  2023  Pharming issued three press releases regarding the events surrounding Silicon Valley Bank. Pharming confirms that it has full access to its deposits.Financial summaryAmounts in US $m except per share data 1Q 2023 1Q 2022Consolidated Income StatementRevenues 42.5 46.6 Gross profit 38.5 41.7 Operating profit (loss) (13.7) 2.8 Finance result  net (2.7) 1.8 Income tax expense 4.5 (0.8) Net Profit (loss) (12.2) 3.5 Consolidated Balance SheetCash & marketable securities(Including restricted cash) 186.2 190.7 Share InformationBasic earnings per share (US$) (0.019) 0.005 Diluted earnings per share (US$) (0.017) 0.005Financial highlightsTotal revenues for the first quarter of 2023 decreased by 9% to US$42.5 million compared to US$46.6 million in the first quarter of 2022. The decrease in overall revenues were primarily due to temporary disruptions in reimbursement for some government patients  which impacted the overall HAE market across all acute and prophylactic products and have since resolved. As a result  shipments to these patients were delayed and impacted February sales in particular. Underlying in-market demand for RUCONEST® however continued to be strong.Gross profit decreased by 8% to US$38.5 million (1Q 2022: US$41.7 million)  mainly due to the decrease in revenues.Operating profit decreased to a loss of US$13.7 million versus an operating profit of US$2.8 million in the first quarter of 2022. This was mainly due to an expected increase in operating expenses from US$39.8 million in the first quarter of 2022 to US$52.7 million in the first quarter of this year. This increase was caused by a combination of launch preparation for leniolisib and increased payroll expenses due to business growth.The Company had a net loss of US$12.2 million  versus a net profit of US$3.5 million in the first quarter of 2022. This was mainly due to the decrease in operating profit and more favorable currency exchange rate results in the first quarter of 2022 versus the first quarter of this year.Negative cash flows from operations amounted to US$22.8 million in the first quarter of 2023. Cash and cash equivalents decreased by US$22.5 million to US$184.8 million from US$207.3 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2022.OutlookFor 2023  the Company anticipates:Continued low  single digit growth in annual revenues from RUCONEST®. Quarterly fluctuations are expected.Following FDA approval  we are commercializing Joenja® (leniolisib) in the U.S. commencing early April 2023 .. We anticipate a positive CHMP opinion for leniolisib in 2H 2023  Marketing Authorisation in Europe expected ~2 months later  followed by commercial launches in individual EU countriesexpected ~2 months later  followed by commercial launches in individual EU countries Following an anticipated positive CHMP opinion in 2H 2023  we intend to submit an ECDRP filing for leniolisib with the U.K. MHRA shortly thereafter. Approval expected several months later.Pharming will continue to allocate resources to accelerate future growth. Investments in launch preparations  commercialization and focused clinical developments for leniolisib including to support pediatric and Japanese approvals  as well as for the development of leniolisib in additional indications  will continue to impact profit throughout 2023. Our current cash on hand  including the continued cash flow of RUCONEST® are expected to be sufficient to fund these investments.Further details on our plans to develop leniolisib in additional indications to be provided in 2H 2023.Investments and continued focus on potential acquisitions and in-licensing of mid to late stage opportunities in rare diseases. Financing  if required  would come via a combination of our strong balance sheet and access to capital markets.No further specific financial guidance for 2023 is provided.Additional informationPresentationThe conference call presentation is available on the Pharming.com website from 07:30 CET  May 11.Conference CallThe conference call will begin at 13:30 CET / 07:30 EDT on Thursday  May 11.

Conference call to be held today at 09:00 CEST (see details on page 5).François-Melchior de Polignac  CEO  commented: “As communicated last March  Maisons du Monde’s sales were down in Q1 due to a high 2022 comparable base and a macroeconomic context that remains complex and continues to weigh on consumer confidence and purchasing power.After completing my deep dive across the organization and hearing extensively from our customers  I am more convinced than ever that Maisons du Monde enjoys both a resilient business model and truly strong fundamentals for growth  with an inspiring “raison d’être”  an ongoing commitment to sustainability and a genuinely strong brand supported by a differentiated offer and an international omnichannel platform.As a first step to resume conditions for profitable growth  the Executive Committee and all Maisons du Monde teams are embracing the immediate launch of a company-wide 3C recovery plan  focusing on Customers  Costs and Cash.First and foremost  this plan shall see us put the customer back at the center of our organization and of everything we do. Secondly  we are accelerating and augmenting our cost reduction plans. Finally  we shall ensure robust cash generation by further optimizing capital expenditures and working capital.Maisons du Monde is fully committed to executing and further expanding our 3C plan  which constitutes both our roadmap to deliver our 2023 guidance and a first step to pave the way for renewed profitable growth.”Q1 2023 KEY HIGHLIGHTSAs flagged in March  the start of the year has been challenging. In the first quarter of the year  Maisons du Monde navigated in a difficult macroeconomic context and a fragile consumption environment in Europe. This resulted in declining traffic at Maisons du Monde  both in stores and online. The Group continued to support sales through a number of initiatives  including inspiring new Spring-Summer and Outdoor collections as well as targeted promotions  and expects a sequential improvement throughout the year.COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENTSBrand and customersDuring the first quarter  Maisons du Monde continued its initiatives to enhance its brand awareness for the benefit of its customers.Total active customers reached 2.2 million  down -4% yoy  whilst omnichannel customers were nearly stable compared to the same period last year (+53% vs Q1 2019).Maisons du Monde’s global social media community grew by +4% yoy  reaching 8.6 million followers across Europe.For the 7th consecutive year  Maisons du Monde was recognized as the second favorite home & living brand1 in France.CollectionsMaisons du Monde released its Spring-Summer collections  Indoor and Outdoor  offering to customers a world tour with six refreshing and exotic destinations under a single watchword: “Ode to Lightness.”Those collections were showcased in Paris in February and have been very positively endorsed by industry experts across Europe  as illustrated by an 80% increase of the audience vs 2022.Commercial and operational initiativesMaisons du Monde continued to propose a unique customer experience with a differentiating offer and initiatives to support purchasing power.Targeted promotions in stores and online : In a context that remains inflationary  Maisons du Monde launched several targeted promotional initiatives to support traffic and conversion  such as specific “small prices” selections and in March  targeted rebates with “Les jours Maisons” and free delivery offers on decoration and furniture items.: In a context that remains inflationary  Maisons du Monde launched several targeted promotional initiatives to support traffic and conversion  such as specific “small prices” selections and in March  targeted rebates with “Les jours Maisons” and free delivery offers on decoration and furniture items. Extension of the marketplace offering : Maisons du Monde’s marketplace continued its development  by enriching its offer to 242 000 references (+59% yoy) and 1 450 curated brands proposed by nearly 560 vendors (+27% yoy)  online and in stores in all three countries (France  Spain and Italy).: Maisons du Monde’s marketplace continued its development  by enriching its offer to 242 000 references (+59% yoy) and 1 450 curated brands proposed by nearly 560 vendors (+27% yoy)  online and in stores in all three countries (France  Spain and Italy). Further activation of the B2B business line: Maisons du Monde increased its visibility through its presence at dedicated international business fairs and extended its number of references proposed to professionals. The B2B segment continued its growth trajectory in hotels (+40% of the sales of the Business Service)  in offices and real estate.Q1 2023 SALES PERFORMANCESummary of sales Q1 23 Q1 22 %Change (in EUR million) Group GMV 307.2 329.1 -6.7% Sales 273.7 313.0 -12.5% Like-for-like -14.0% -4.0% Sales by product category2 Decoration 155.7 171.7 -9.3% % of sales 56.9% 54.8% Furniture 118.0 141.3 -16.5% % of sales 43.1% 45.2% Sales by distribution channel Stores 196.0 208.9 -6.2% % of sales 71.6% 66.7% Online 77.7 104.1 -25.4% % of sales 28.4% 33.3% Sales by geography France 148.0 161.6 -8.5% % of sales 54.1% 51.6% International 125.8 151.4 -16.9% % of sales 45.9% 48.4%Q1 2023 Group GMV was €307.2 million  down -6.7% yoy (+13.3% vs Q1 2019)  with online GMV representing 35.3% of Group GMV  a level comparable to 2022.

This resulted in lower traffic  both in-store and online  and a declining conversion rate vs the same period in 2022.Sales by channelQ1 2023 online sales were €77.7 million  down -25.4% yoy (+8 8% vs Q1 2019) and represented 28.4% of Group sales compared to 33.3% in Q1 2022  reflecting dual momentum with an activity decrease on Maisons du Monde’s website on high comps and buoyant marketplace growth. Traffic was negative vs last year but still up compared to the same period in 2019 (+50%).Q1 2023 store sales amounted to €196.0 million  down -6.2% yoy (-1.9% vs 2019)  reflecting lower traffic compared to Q1 2022.Continuing its active store network management  Maisons du Monde operated 352 stores at the end of March 2023  compared to 350 stores in March 2022  with 6 closures over the quarter vs year-end 2022.Sales by categoryQ1 2023 decoration sales amounted to €155.7 million  down -9.3% yoy (+4.6% vs 2019) and accounted for 56.9% of total sales. The category was supported by targeted promotional and non-promotional initiatives (E.g. Les jours Maisons  free delivery  etc.).2 All commissions (marketplace and Rhinov’s decoration services) are integrated in the “Sales by product category” line (decoration and furniture). For comparison purpose  Q1 2022 figures have been adjusted.Q1 2023 furniture sales totaled €118.0 million  down -16.5% yoy (-3.4% vs 2019).Despite improvement in product availability and more selective promotions  the category suffered from the effects of continued high inflation and from deferred spending decisions by customers. This context deteriorated in mid-Q2 2022  creating a high comparable base.Sales by geographyQ1 2023 sales in France were €148.0 million  down -8.5% yoy (-5.3% vs 2019) penalized by strikes against pension reform from mid-January. Store sales accounted for 73%. The number of stores stood at 215  vs 218 at the end of 2022 and 221 at the end of Q1 2019  illustrating a disciplined adjustment of the retail network.Q1 2023 international sales totaled €125.8 million  down -16.9% yoy (+9.5 vs 2019). Combined sales in Spain and Italy (more than 50% of total international sales) were -10.6% yoy (+12% vs 2019). Combined sales in Belgium  Germany  and Switzerland (35% of total international sales) decreased by -23.1% yoy. Compared to 2019  sales in that region were up by +7.5%  thanks to an additional 25 stores since 2019. Over the quarter  international online sales were down -34%  mainly driven by Germany and reflecting strong resource allocation decisions made to optimize return on marketing investments.After several years of market presence in the UK  Maisons du Monde decided to shut down its loss-making operations in this country. The Group did not have a retail footprint in the country and therefore did not benefit from the same brand awareness. Sales in the UK  only online  represented thus just 1% of Group sales in full-year 2022. Activities will stop by the end of Q2.2023 PRIORITIES: CUSTOMERS  COSTS & CASHAfter the first weeks of immersion with Maisons du Monde teams and given persistent macroeconomic uncertainties  new CEO François-Melchior de Polignac  together with the Executive Committee  revisited immediate priorities and launched a company-wide “3C plan” focusing on Customers  Costs & Cash to strengthen the model and rapidly resume conditions for profitable organic growth:Customers: Focus on customer excellence to create conditions for growth in H2Prioritize customer-centricity  notably by implementing a cross-functional customer committee in charge of enforcing Top 30 customer initiatives.Enhance store execution to deliver better customer experience notably by improving order availability of furniture showcased in stores and by reinforcing in-store staff communication devices to speed up customer service.Improve price accessibility to support purchasing power by implementing selective and relevant price adjustments as well as targeted promotions  whilst safeguarding gross margin.Costs: Accelerate operating model streamlining through strong cost optimization initiatives to generate savings of €25m before inflationFurther adapt the cost base  notably by optimizing structures at Head Office level and worked hours at store level.Improve resource allocation  notably by reviewing and streamlining the project portfolio.Cash: Ensure robust cash generationFurther optimize Capex policy to deliver higher ROI.Optimize inventory management notably by improving store allocation.Improve payment terms by extending implementation of new terms to all suppliers.2023 GUIDANCEIn line with the 2023 roadmap  articulated around the 3C plan  and considering the comparable base effect on the group’s H1 performance  Maisons du Monde’s 2023 objectives are:Top line decrease in the low-to-mid-single digit range  with a sequential improvement in H2 vs H1EBIT in a range of €65 million to €75 millionFree Cash Flow in a range of €40 million to €50 millionDividend payout ratio of 30% to 40%ESG commitment: One-third of Maisons du Monde’s 2023 collections included in the ‘Good is beautiful’ selectionUPDATE ON THE SHARE BUYBACK PROGRAMOn 29 July 2022  the Group launched a second share buyback program with an objective of repurchasing up to 10% of its outstanding shares at market price over a period of several months.At 2 May 2023  the Group had purchased 3 526 167 of its own shares  i.e. 81.5% of the program at an average price per share of €10.24.On 8 March 2023  the Board of Directors decided to cancel 2 300 000 of the treasury shares (or 5.3% of the total shares) it acquired under this share buyback program.

Conference call to be held today at 09:00 CEST (see details on page 5).François-Melchior de Polignac  CEO  commented: “As communicated last March  Maisons du Monde’s sales were down in Q1 due to a high 2022 comparable base and a macroeconomic context that remains complex and continues to weigh on consumer confidence and purchasing power.After completing my deep dive across the organization and hearing extensively from our customers  I am more convinced than ever that Maisons du Monde enjoys both a resilient business model and truly strong fundamentals for growth  with an inspiring “raison d’être”  an ongoing commitment to sustainability and a genuinely strong brand supported by a differentiated offer and an international omnichannel platform.As a first step to resume conditions for profitable growth  the Executive Committee and all Maisons du Monde teams are embracing the immediate launch of a company-wide 3C recovery plan  focusing on Customers  Costs and Cash.First and foremost  this plan shall see us put the customer back at the center of our organization and of everything we do. Secondly  we are accelerating and augmenting our cost reduction plans. Finally  we shall ensure robust cash generation by further optimizing capital expenditures and working capital.Maisons du Monde is fully committed to executing and further expanding our 3C plan  which constitutes both our roadmap to deliver our 2023 guidance and a first step to pave the way for renewed profitable growth.”Q1 2023 KEY HIGHLIGHTSAs flagged in March  the start of the year has been challenging. In the first quarter of the year  Maisons du Monde navigated in a difficult macroeconomic context and a fragile consumption environment in Europe. This resulted in declining traffic at Maisons du Monde  both in stores and online. The Group continued to support sales through a number of initiatives  including inspiring new Spring-Summer and Outdoor collections as well as targeted promotions  and expects a sequential improvement throughout the year.COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENTSBrand and customersDuring the first quarter  Maisons du Monde continued its initiatives to enhance its brand awareness for the benefit of its customers.Total active customers reached 2.2 million  down -4% yoy  whilst omnichannel customers were nearly stable compared to the same period last year (+53% vs Q1 2019).Maisons du Monde’s global social media community grew by +4% yoy  reaching 8.6 million followers across Europe.For the 7th consecutive year  Maisons du Monde was recognized as the second favorite home & living brand1 in France.CollectionsMaisons du Monde released its Spring-Summer collections  Indoor and Outdoor  offering to customers a world tour with six refreshing and exotic destinations under a single watchword: “Ode to Lightness.”Those collections were showcased in Paris in February and have been very positively endorsed by industry experts across Europe  as illustrated by an 80% increase of the audience vs 2022.Commercial and operational initiativesMaisons du Monde continued to propose a unique customer experience with a differentiating offer and initiatives to support purchasing power.Targeted promotions in stores and online : In a context that remains inflationary  Maisons du Monde launched several targeted promotional initiatives to support traffic and conversion  such as specific “small prices” selections and in March  targeted rebates with “Les jours Maisons” and free delivery offers on decoration and furniture items.: In a context that remains inflationary  Maisons du Monde launched several targeted promotional initiatives to support traffic and conversion  such as specific “small prices” selections and in March  targeted rebates with “Les jours Maisons” and free delivery offers on decoration and furniture items. Extension of the marketplace offering : Maisons du Monde’s marketplace continued its development  by enriching its offer to 242 000 references (+59% yoy) and 1 450 curated brands proposed by nearly 560 vendors (+27% yoy)  online and in stores in all three countries (France  Spain and Italy).: Maisons du Monde’s marketplace continued its development  by enriching its offer to 242 000 references (+59% yoy) and 1 450 curated brands proposed by nearly 560 vendors (+27% yoy)  online and in stores in all three countries (France  Spain and Italy). Further activation of the B2B business line: Maisons du Monde increased its visibility through its presence at dedicated international business fairs and extended its number of references proposed to professionals.

Our Q1 2023 organic revenue growth reached +8.2% outside China and -14.0% in China.Digital Out-Of-Home (DOOH) grew by +13.3% in reported growth and +13.6% organically in Q1 2023  to reach 31.2% of Group revenue vs 29.1% in Q1 2022 including a continued strong momentum of the programmatic advertising sales ecosystem through the VIOOH SSP (Supply Side Platform) and Displayce DSP (Demand Side Platform).By activity  Street Furniture was strong at +4.1% organically in Q1 2023 and was above Q1 2019 globally including double-digit above Q1 2019 in France and Rest of Europe; Billboard grew by +1.0% on an organic basis in Q1 2023  above Q1 2019 in Asia-Pacific and North-America; Transport grew strongly by +7.9% organically  including a double-digit revenue growth in France  Rest of Europe  UK and Rest of the World reflecting the ongoing audience recovery in both airports and public transport across most regions with Rest of the World above 2019 in Q1. From a historically low level of activity  China improved throughout the quarter following the end of mobility restrictions at the end of 2022.By geography  Rest of the World  Asia-Pacific excluding China  France and Rest of Europe were the fastest growing regions while revenue for North America and China decreased in Q1 2023 but the trading momentum improved significantly in these two geographies in March.As far as Q2 is concerned  we expect organic revenue growth around +9% mostly driven by a strong digital growth and a gradual recovery in China while advertising sales in most geographies remain solid.In China  we are seeing encouraging signs of recovery with domestic mobility now back to normal leading us to a strong year-on-year double-digit revenue growth in Q2. As domestic air travel reached an all-time high for the Labor Day holiday  our domestic airport business is expected to almost recover to pre-Covid levels in Q2  in line with the air traffic rebound. Our strong revenue growth in China for Q2 is nevertheless affected by low international air traffic due to much reduced international airlines connections and the non-renewal of the Guangzhou International Terminal 2 airport advertising contract as well as our decision to mutually terminate our joint venture with Guangzhou metro.As the most digitised global OOH media company  with our new data-led audience targeting and programmatic solutions  our well diversified portfolio  our ability to win new contracts  the strength of our balance sheet  the high quality of our teams across the world and our recognised ESG excellence  we believe we are well positioned to benefit from the rebound. We are more than ever confident in the power of our media in an advertising landscape increasingly fragmented and more and more digital and in the role it will play to drive economic growth as well as positive changes.”Following the adoption of IFRS 11 from January 1st  2014  the operating data presented below is adjusted to include our prorata share in companies under joint control.

The Company commented: ""Sales in the first quarter of 2023 showed significant growth  equally due to strong order intake for the Spring/Summer collection by multi-brand customers and renewed reliability of the transport and supply chain  resulting in excellent service levels for the market with a significant advance in deliveries and reduced cancellations compared to the first quarter of the previous year. Comparable sales of our direct physical stores recorded close to double-digit growth  offsetting the closure of other non-strategic stores and the initial weakness in online sales. The multi-brand channel reported prudent results in April  with some weakness in reorders compared to the previous year  while comparable sales of physical stores remained positive and online sales continued to recover. All of these factors  combined with the reabsorption of the temporary impact of advance shipments  resulted in an 8% rise in total revenues at the end of April  on a comparable basis. To date  this increase represents a good estimate for growth in the first half of the year. Net working capital stood at Euro 142 million  up from Euro 104.1 million at the end of March 2022  accounting for 18.3% of revenues  compared to 16.1% the previous March. This growth is due to the seasonal nature of the business and  in particular  the need to purchase new product in order to meet the strong growth in revenues. Consequently  the net financial position (pre-IFRS 16) also showed a coherent change  going from Euro -49.8 million in December 2022 1 to Euro -97.8 million in March 2023. This temporary trend is not only explained by growth but it is also related to the strong advance in deliveries compared to the previous year with  therefore a related advance in purchases and payments to suppliers. 2023 is therefore off to a good start  despite the uncertain international geo-political situation and the inflationary context that seems to be more persistent than expected. This has resulted in a prudent approach as we continue to monitor any drops in the propensity to consume in the main markets. However  careful purchasing and discount reduction policies  along with the aforementioned improvement in supply chain reliability in terms of costs and delivery times  confirm expectations for an increase in industrial margins. Thanks to the results achieved by Geox in this uncertain and volatile context in the short term  which further confirm the path taken  we can look confidently to the future of both our Brand and the entire sector in the medium-long term."" GROUP OPERATING PERFORMANCE: SALES Consolidated sales totalled Euro 223.7 million in the first quarter of 2023  up 21.3% on the previous year (+18.9% at constant forex) mainly thanks to the strong performance of the multi-brand (+32.7%) and franchising (+31.8%) channels.

Sales benefitted from a strong order intake (approx. +17%) for the SS23 Collection  combined with a positive timing effect in the quarter due to the significant improvement of transport and supply chain conditions  starting from the end of 2022. Franchising channel sales  equal to 9.2% of Group sales  amounted to Euro 20.6 million  +31.8% compared to the first quarter of 2022. This channel also benefitted from positive performance (comparable sales up 9.2%) and the favourable effect of delivery times. The total number of franchised stores decreased from 301 stores in March 2022 to 284 stores in March 2023. Directly-operated store (DOS) sales accounted for 29.9% of the Group total  amounting to Euro 67.0 million compared to Euro 66.1 million in the first quarter of 2022 (+1.3% at current forex  +0 0% at constant forex). Comparable sales (LFL) at the end of the period were up 3.5%. Physical stores in particular reported an increase in comparable sales of approx. 9.1% on the first quarter of 2022 (+7.6% to date)  while the online channel saw a decline of -11.7%(-9.4% to date) in line with the stabilisation of performance following the lockdowns. Direct online channel growth  however  remained particularly robust (approx. +76.2%) with respect to 2019. 2 Finally  in terms of the distribution perimeter  the number of DOS decreased from 339 stores in March 2022 to 291stores in March 2023 (315 at the end of 2022). This reduction was the main cause of the overall change in channel sales  which despite a rise in comparable sales (LFL) of +3.5%  increased in the period by approx. +1.3%.

Sales were driven by the wholesale channel (+67.6%)  which accounts for approximately 50% of market revenues  and benefitted from strong order intake (+23%) for the SS23 Collection and the aforementioned positive timing effect. The franchising channel (+19.8%) and directly-operated stores (+7%) performed well in terms of comparable sales  up +11.8% and 7.6% respectively. Sales generated in Europe  equal to 41.9% of the Group total (46.1% in the first quarter of 2022)  totalled Euro 93.7 million  compared to Euro 85.0 million in the first quarter of 2022  up 10.3% mainly due to (as in Italy) the good performance of the multi-brand channel (+16%)  which accounted for approximately 65% of market revenues. Directly-operated stores (DOS) in Europe reported negative performance (-4.4%) due to the decline in the online channel (-19.5%) and reduced distribution perimeter  which were not offset by the good performance of comparable sales at physical stores (+12.3%). North America reported sales of Euro 7.5 million  +48.9% (+48.8% at constant forex) compared to the first quarter of 2022; growth in the region was driven by the wholesale channel (+110.5%). Directly-operated stores also recorded a positive trend (+6.2%)  with comparable sales performing well (+24.7%). Other Countries reported sales growth of +28.9% compared to the first quarter of 2022 (+18.5% at constant forex).

Sales by Product Category Footwear accounted for approximately 90.4% of consolidated sales  amounting to Euro 202.4 million  +24.6% (+22.5% at constant forex) on the first quarter of 2022. Apparel accounted for approx. 9.6% of consolidated sales  totalling Euro 21.4 million (-2.9% at current forex  -7.2% at constant forex).

GROUP BALANCE SHEET AND FINANCIAL POSITION The net financial position (before IFRS 16 and after the fair value of derivative contracts) stood at Euro -97.8 million (Euro -49.8 million in December 2022 and Euro -58.0 million in March 2022). The net bank debt alone amounted to Euro -115.5 million (Euro -75.7 million in December 2022 and Euro -85.6 million in March 2022). The fair value of hedging transactions in place at March 31 was therefore positive by Euro 17.7 million. The trend in the net financial position is closely linked to the trend in working capital. Net working capital stood at approx. Euro 142 million  up from Euro 77 million at the end of December 2022 and Euro 104 million at the end of March 2022. This increase is attributable to the seasonal nature of the business and the sales growth recorded during the period. Inventories decreased by approx. Euro 37 million compared to December 2022  but were up approx. Euro 26 million compared to the first quarter of 2022. The good performance of the wholesale and franchising businesses and seasonality led to an increase in accounts receivable compared to both December (+58 million) and March 2022 (+29 million). Trade payables decreased by Euro 44 million compared to December 2022  4 despite recording an increase of Euro 16 million over March 2022  as a result of the earlier timing of new product purchases compared to previous periods. Consequently  net working capital in the period accounted for 18.3% of revenues (10.5% at the end of December 2022 and 16.1% at the end of March 2022). This incidence is expected to decrease during the year and normalize by year-end in the range of 16%-18%  which is still slightly better than the assumptions in the business plan (21%-23%). This incidence  among the best in our industry  is however higher than the 10% recorded in 2022. It is therefore a return to normality  but 2023 is a year of strong discontinuity in working capital and cash flow for two factors. On the one hand  the Group  with FW22  has finished reusing the excess unsold inventory that had reduced purchases in recent seasons and is now coping with the increase in orders exclusively by purchasing new product. On the other hand  the supply chain problems experienced in 2022 are leading to a shift of more payments to the first half of this year in the amount of about Euro 18 million resulting from delivery delays in the previous season  while the renewed reliability of the supply chain in 2023 is leading to an advance in Spring/Summer payments in the amount of about Euro 57 million. Overall  the first half of the year will therefore record higher payments to suppliers of about Euro 75 million compared to the same period last year. This will lead to a strong reduction in trade payables compared to December 2022 with a consequent increase in working capital and an equal absorption of cash. However  it is expected that the second quarter will generate positive cash flows with a consequent reduction of the debt to banks compared to March. However  the context still remains uncertain and volatile  consequently  the Group will continue with initiatives aimed at protecting the company's cash flow and containing operating costs by carefully monitoring cash flows in the second quarter in order to take - if and when necessary - any further action deemed necessary or appropriate also in light of the existing financial constraints. SIGNIFICANT AND/OR SUBSEQUENT EVENTS INTERNATIONAL TENSIONS AND UPDATE ON COVID-19 IMPACT ON STORE OPERATIONS AND THE SUPPLY OF RAW MATERIALS AND FINISHED PRODUCTS Russia's invasion of Ukraine continues to create a major international humanitarian and social crisis  with significant impacts primarily for the living conditions of the populations of these countries  but also for internal economic activities and commercial trade in the area. These extraordinary events in terms of their nature and extent have had global repercussions on: i) supply chains  particularly with regard to the supply and prices of raw materials and energy; (ii) international market demand level; (iii) inflation and the consequent restrictive interest-rate policies; and (iv) the strengthening of the dollar as a haven from risk  the divergent performance of the US economy and rising interest rates. In general  these negative factors are gradually improving. In both countries Geox's business is mainly developed through third parties  wholesale and franchising (100% in Ukraine and 70% in Russia). In view of these events  the Group suspended fresh direct investment in Russia shortly after the outbreak of the conflict  withdrawing European management and is managing the short-term situation so as to be prepared to mitigate the impacts from any future decisions regarding its presence in Russia. Sales in Russia as of March 31  2023 continued to account for approx. 10% of revenues while sales in Ukraine showed slight growth. The invested capital of the Russian subsidiary mainly comprises fast-moving net working capital  however devaluation of the Ruble had a negative impact in the quarter  which could persist considering that the currency can no longer be hedged. The Group does not have suppliers or production plants in the region. The company was part of the 'Golden Links' project promoted by Banca Intesa and Caritas Italiana  and actively cooperated with Civil Protection  several humanitarian associations  the Embassy of Ukraine in Italy and the Ukrainian Consulate in Venice for the supply of basic necessities such as clothing and footwear to people on the ground and refugees in Italy. In terms of the COVID-19 pandemic  all Group stores are currently operational. The WHO recently announced the end of the global health emergency declared more than three years ago due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This factor should further encourage tourist flows  which are already recovering but yet to reach pre-pandemic levels. 5 Attachments Original LinkOriginal DocumentPermalink Disclaimer Geox S.p.A. published this content on 11 May 2023 and is solely responsible for the information contained therein.

SATO had operated in St Petersburg since 2007 and owned 522 rental apartments. The transaction has no significant effect on SATO Corporation’s result.In January  SATO was awarded the 2023 Great Place To Work® certificate and was ranked at number ten in in the category for large enterprises among Finland’s best places to work. I am very proud and grateful about this recognition  as we in the entire organisation have made sustained efforts to develop our culture at SATO. A total of 85% of SATO employees find that SATO as a whole is a very good place to work.We decided in the autumn that we will not launch any new investments for the time being. The rationale behind our decision was the strong increase in construction and property maintenance costs as well as in financing costs while at the same time rent development remained moderate due to the market situation.In February 135 new SATO rental homes were completed in a 16-storey tower block in Vermonniitty  Espoo.During the period under review (1 January to 31 March 2023)  SATO’s occupancy rate improved year on year and was 95.0% (94.6). After the coronavirus pandemic  demand for SATO rental homes has been picking up since spring 2022. The economic uncertainty and higher consumer prices and interest rates resulting from the war in Ukraine are also in part reflected in the rising demand for rental homes.In growth centres  the continued high level of new housing production has sustained intense competition for good tenants. Due to the competitive situation  it has not been possible to transfer the higher maintenance costs in full to apartment rents.Because the inflation and the interest rates seem to stay higher for a longer time than expected  the yields for real estate investments are under pressure to rise further. This in turn can have an impact on the fair value of the investment properties.I would like to thank SATO employees for their great work to develop customer satisfaction and the housing comfort of our residents.Operating environmentOver the reporting period  SATO’s operating environment was affected by the war in Ukraine  the rise in costs due to inflation and the continued high level of rental housing supply.The surge in energy prices brought on by the war in Ukraine pushed the Finnish economy into recession in late 2022. Even though an energy crisis was avoided  the economy’s weak performance has persisted due to protracted inflation and high interest rates. Since the turn of the year  energy prices have fallen and inflation has slowed down slightly  but underlying inflation has remained persistently at a high level and that is why central banks have continued their policy of tightening interest rates. Consumer confidence has remained weak and is reflected in consumer caution. According to the Bank of Finland’s interim forecast of 17 March  economic growth will remain very weak in 2023 and take a slight upturn in 2024. The favourable trend in the employment rate will level off due to the standstill in economic growth but is not projected to decline. The Bank of Finland projects inflation to be 4.6% in 2023 and to return to below 2% in 2024.The economic uncertainty  high interest rate level and increases in living costs have affected the number of housing transactions. In the first months of the year  transaction volumes of both new and old homes have been exceptionally low. The record-low demand also has a strong impact on the number of housing construction projects commenced. The Confederation of Finnish Construction Industries RT forecast of 29 May projects that the volume of new housing construction will decline by almost a third this year to around 27 000 homes. Projects started in 2021 and in early 2022 will  however  still maintain the supply of new homes at a high level in the Helsinki Metropolitan throughout 2023. Competition for good tenants will remain intense and rent increases moderate. The cost level driven up by inflation is  however  creating pressure for rent increases in the future.With greater choice available for those looking for a home  the role of a particularly successful customer experience has become even more important. SATO is strongly invested in increasing its presence close to customers and in digital services.With the good employment situation continuing  migration to large growth centres has accelerated. The Helsinki region’s migration gain in 2022 was 17 420 people – the largest in the 2000s according to Statistics Finland preliminary data. This is reflected in the demand for rental homes in growth centres. The economic uncertainty and the climbing home loan interest rates coupled with increasing energy and other costs may also contribute towards growth in demand for rental housing. Some of those looking for a home to buy may now also consider a rental home as an option.There is demand for rental homes in growth centres close to good public transport connections and services. The urbanisation trend continues  and dense urban housing with good access to public transport is becoming increasingly popular in Finland. The Helsinki Metropolitan Area (HMA)  Tampere and Turku continue to enjoy strong growth  while at the same time Statistics Finland forecasts a downturn in the nationwide population trend in 2031. The HMA is projected to grow by more than 200 000 new residents by 2040. Almost 80% of HMA residents already live in households with one to two members  and the proportion of small households continues to grow. The proportion of immigrants is projected to increase in the HMA from the current 17% to 25% by 2030. The ageing population is moving to growth centres providing access to services and expects more and more housing-related services. The demographic change and the price development of owner-occupied homes create a stable foundation for rental housing demand  especially in the HMA  Tampere and Turku.REVIEW PERIOD 1 JANUARY TO 31 MARCH 2023 (1 JANUARY TO 31 MARCH 2022)Net sales and profitIn January–March 2023  SATO Corporation’s consolidated net sales totalled EUR 70.9 million (74.7).Operating profit was EUR -17.1 million (117.9).

On average  the economic occupancy rate of apartments in Finland was 95.0% (94.6) and the external tenant turnover 25.3% (26.2).At the end of the reporting period  the average monthly rent of SATO rental homes in Finland was EUR 17.99 per m2 (17.44).Net rental income from apartments totalled EUR 40.8 million (44.4).Investment propertiesOn 31 March 2023  SATO owned a total of 25 389 homes (26 771). The reporting period saw the completion of 135 rental homes (0). The number of divested rental apartments was 3.Fair valueThe development of the value of rental apartments is a key factor for SATO. Its housing stock is concentrated in areas and apartment sizes which are expected to be the focus  in the long term  of increasing rental apartment demand. The allocation of building repairs is based on life-cycle plans and repair need specifications.At the end of March  the fair value of investment properties came to a total of EUR 5 044.8 million (5 129.1). The change in the value of investment properties  including the rental apartments acquired and divested during the reporting period  was EUR 0.7 million (96.3).The value of properties funded with ARAVA loans or interest-subsidised loans would be EUR 294 million higher when valuated with income value method.At the end of March  the commuting zone of the Helsinki Metropolitan Area accounted for around 87% and Tampere and Turku together made up around 12% and St Peterburg around 1% of the value of apartments.Investments  divestments and property developmentInvestment activities are used to manage the housing portfolio and prepare the ground for growth. Since 2000  SATO has invested more than EUR 3 billion in non-subsidised rental apartments. SATO acquires and builds entire rental buildings and single rental apartments. Property development allows for new investments in rental apartments in Finland. The rental potential and value of rental apartments owned by SATO are developed through renovation activities.Investments in apartments totalled EUR 46.2 million (23.7). The Helsinki Metropolitan Area represented 86.9% of all investments during the period under review. New apartments accounted for 59.4% of the total. In addition  on 31 March 2023 there were binding purchase agreements to a total of EUR 86.2 million (131.3) in Finland.During the period under review  3 rental homes (7) were divested in Finland. Their total value amounted to EUR 0.5 million (2.6).The book value of the plot reserve owned at the end of March totalled EUR 48.1 million (42.7). The value of new plots acquired by the end of March totalled EUR 0.0 million (0.0).Permitted building volume for around 1 400 homes is being developed for plots in the company’s housing portfolio. This allows SATO to utilise existing infrastructure  create a denser urban structure and thus bring more customers closer to services and public transport connections.In Finland  135 rental homes (0)  0 owner-occupied homes (0) and 0 FlexHomes (0) were completed. On 31 March 2023  a total of 1 192 rental homes (1 100)  0 owner-occupied homes (0) and 0 FlexHomes (52) were under construction.A total of EUR 7.0 million (5.2) was spent on repairing apartments and improving their quality.At the end of March  SATO had a total 522 apartments (522) in St Petersburg. The economic occupancy rate of rental homes in St Petersburg averaged 85.5 % (98.2). Investments in Russia commenced in 2007. The last investment decision was made in 2013 and the property was completed in 2016. Following the start of the war in Ukraine  SATO made a decision in principle to exit the business in Russia. SATO completed the divestment of the housing business in Russia on 14 April 2023 and SATO no longer has operations in Russia.PersonnelAt the end of March  the Group had 329 employees (322)  of whom 301 had a permanent employment contract (295).

The Annual General Meeting re-elected Erik Selin as Chairman of the Board. Esa Lager  Tarja Pääkkönen  Sharam Rahi  Johannus (Hans) Spikker and Timo Stenius will also continue as Board members.The audit firm Deloitte Ltd was appointed as the auditor.

SATO had operated in St Petersburg since 2007 and owned 522 rental apartments. The transaction has no significant effect on SATO Corporation’s result.On May  due to the current market of construction business  the company has started change negotiations with the organization of its investments business unit.Laura Laamanen has been appointed Chief Commercial Officer and member of the Corporate Management Group at SATO Corporation effective 11 May 2023.Short-term risks and uncertaintiesRisk management is used to ensure that risks impacting the company’s business are identified  managed and monitored. The main risks of SATO’s business are risks related to the business environment and financial risks.The war in Ukraine is a short-term risk affecting the operating environment  the duration and impacts of which on the Finnish economy are difficult to estimate. The war’s biggest impacts have been seen in the prices of energy  food and materials as well as in supply chains. The surge in prices has resulted in a rapid increase in the interest rate level. The increase in price level may slow economic growth  continue to considerably increase the interest rate level  and have a negative effect on the purchasing power of consumers as well as on their capacity to perform their obligations. Such a decline in the economy or economic activity may have an adverse effect on the financial performance or activities  finance costs or value of SATO-owned properties.The highest risks in apartment rental are to do with cyclical movements and changes in supply and demand. The market risk may push the supply of rental homes higher than their demand. This would result in idle rental housing stock and pressure for rents to level off or fall  especially as regards old housing stock.A decline in the housing market may have a negative effect on the market value of SATO’s housing stock. In line with its refined strategy  SATO has been focusing in its investments on growth centres and on renovating and repairing existing housing stock and  consequently  ensuring the rentability and value development of the apartments.Changes in regulation by the authorities and in legislation and related uncertainty may have a significant impact on the reliability of the investment environment and  consequently  on SATO’s business. SATO monitors and anticipates these changes and also calls attention to what it considers to be negative impacts of regulation.The management of financial risks is steered by the Group’s treasury policy. Our risk management principles have been defined in the treasury policy adopted by SATO’s Board of Directors. Our most significant financial risks relate to liquidity  refinancing and interest rates. We manage our liquidity and refinancing risks by diversifying the financing sources and maturity of our loan portfolio  and by holding sufficient liquidity reserves in the form of committed credit facilities and other financing commitments. In 2019  the company issued an EUR 1.5 billion Euro Medium Term Notes (EMTN) Programme  under which SATO has issued bonds in the total amount of EUR 1 050.0 million.The means for managing liquidity risk at SATO include cash assets  a bank account limit  EUR 700 million in committed credit facilities and a EUR 400 million commercial paper programme. We increase the amount of reserves as the funding requirements grow. Our objective is to keep the liquidity requirements of the next 12 months covered by committed agreements.Floating rate loans represent an interest rate risk which we manage by balancing the share of fixed and floating rate loans either by fixed rate debt arrangements or interest rate derivatives. In accordance with our treasury policy  our aim is for fixed-rate loans  including interest rate derivatives  to account for more than 60% of our debt portfolio. At theend of the review period  the fixed rate portion of the loan portfolio after hedging was 68.6% (excluding short-term loans).For a broader description of risks and risk management  see the Group’s website and Annual Report for 2022 at www.sato.fi/en.OutlookIn the operating environment  SATO’s business activities are mainly affected by consumer confidence  development of purchasing power  rent and price development for apartments  the competitive situation and interest rate level.The surge in energy prices brought on by the war in Ukraine pushed the Finnish economy into recession in late 2022. Even though an energy crisis was avoided  the economy’s weak performance has persisted due to protracted inflation and high interest rates. Since the turn of the year  energy prices have fallen and inflation has slowed down slightly  but underlying inflation has remained persistently at a high level and that is why central banks have continued their policy of tightening interest rates. Consumer confidence has remained weak and is reflected in consumer caution. According to the Bank of Finland’s interim forecast of 17 March  economic growth will remain very weak in 2023 and take a slight upturn in 2024. The favourable trend in the employment rate will level off due to the standstill in economic growth but is not projected to decline. The Bank of Finland projects inflation to be 4.6% in 2023 and to return to below 2% in 2024.The economic uncertainty  high interest rate level and increases in living costs have affected the number of housing transactions. In the first months of the year  transaction volumes of both new and old homes have been exceptionally low. The record-low demand also has a strong impact on the number of housing construction projects commenced. The Confederation of Finnish Construction Industries RT forecast of 29 May projects that the volume of new housing construction will decline by almost a third this year to around 27 000 homes. Projects started in 2021 and in early 2022 will  however  still maintain the supply of new homes at a high level in the Helsinki Metropolitan throughout 2023. Competition for good tenants will remain intense and rent increases moderate. The cost level driven up by inflation is  however  creating pressure for rent increases in the future. Going forward  the declining supply of rental homes will improve the occupancy rate and opportunities to raise prices to reflect the changing costs.With greater choice available for those looking for a home  the role of a particularly successful customer experience has become even more important. SATO is strongly invested in increasing its presence close to customers and in digital services.With the good employment situation continuing  migration to large growth centres has accelerated. Helsinki region’s migration gain in 2022 was 17 420 people – the largest in the 2000s according to Statistics Finland preliminary data. This is reflected in the demand for rental homes in growth centres. The economic uncertainty and the climbing home loan interest rates coupled with increasing energy and other costs may also contribute towards growth in demand for rental housing. Some of those looking for a home to buy may now also consider a rental home as an option.In line with its majority shareholder’s operating model  SATO Corporation will not publish guidance on its 2023 earnings.

This transaction generated a capital gain of USD 22.1 million. The Cap Charles was debt free and delivered to her new owner on 16 February 2023. Sale VLCC Nautica to United Nations for salvage operation On 10 March 2023 - Euronav NV signed an agreement with the UN to sell a VLCC as part of a wider salvage operation for the FSO Safer located in Yemen. Euronav can confirm that vessel is the Nautica (2008 - 307 284 dwt) which we bought back from a sale and leaseback agreement before retrofitting the vessel for necessary modifications and regular maintenance before sailing to the location of the FSO Safer. The Nautica will replace the FSO Safer and will stay there. Euronav will help transferring the oil and operate the vessel for a transition period of several months. The entire team of Euronav is very committed to be able to participate to such project and do their utmost to help providing a solution for a potential environmental challenge. Update - Newbuilding delivery schedule Outstanding capital expenditure for the 6 vessels (1 VLCCs and 5 Suezmax) currently under construction at the end of Q1 2023 was USD 279 million  split as follows: USD 142 million in 2023  USD 137 million in 2024. Euronav took delivery of the VLCC Cassius (2023 - 299 158 dwt) on 11 January 2023 and VLCC Camus (2023- 299.158) on 28 February 2023. TANKER MARKET & OUTLOOK The key feature of Q1 has been the counter seasonal strength in freight rates. Sequential improvement in rates in both VLCC and Suezmax was experienced month on month from January to March. This unusual trading pattern - only the third time this has occurred since 1990 in both VLCC & Suezmax sectors - underpins the strong fundamentals of the large crude tanker market. The key structural drivers of our market remain in place with very little change in: (a) contracting - zero VLCC and just six Suezmax year-to-date (b) fleet capacity - average vessel speeds remained unchanged during Q1 (c) shipbuilding capacity - constrained until end of 2025/6 by other LNG/Container orders (d) asset values - remain well supported with 5-10 year old vintages still rising Since the quarter end  rates in both the VLCC and Suezmax segments have declined and the announcement by OPEC+ to reduce production from May 2023 likely to create a headwinds. However  these reductions will be primarily focused on Middle East sources. With Far East markets the key driver of demand and consumption growth is in the Far East  so the alternative crude sourcing will have to come from Atlantic barrels thus requiring transportation of about twice the distance. This positive ton mile dynamic in favour of tanker markets should offset some of the loss from lower Middle East cargo supply. Asset Values The pace of asset value increase for crude tankers has continued to ease and remains focused on 5-10 year old vessels. During Q1 2023 5 and 10 year old VLCCs rose 5% and 9% in value with their Suezmax counterparts increasing 5% and 11% respectively. New and vintage tonnage age classes remained stable during the quarter. Crude oil demand The IEA continue to forecast a sharp acceleration of crude demand over the course of 2023 from 710k bpd in Q1 2023 to 2.6m bpd in Q4 2023. Global oil demand is expected to reach a record 102m bpd consumption during calendar 2023. The key drivers of this rebound will be recovering air traffic and the release of pent up Chinese demand as global consumption of crude is restored to levels pre-Covid-19 for the first time. Vessel Supply In the eight quarters to end Q1 2023 just two VLCC and 17 Suezmax were contracted. Suezmax contracting has ""accelerated"" with 5 orders in Q1 on the back of 9 orders in Q4 2022 (source: Clarksons). Orderbooks remain at historically low levels - VLCC at just 1.7% at end March 2023 with Suezmax ratio at 3.5%. Unsurprisingly there was no recycling of VLCC or Suezmax vessels during Q1 given such buoyant freight markets. Freight rates - consistent improvement and time charter emerging trend Sequential improvement month on month for freight rates was recorded in both VLCC and Suezmax sectors during Q1. It is also encouraging that despite higher freight rates vessel speeds were kept in check with no change between average speeds in Q1 compared to Q4 2022 in either VLCC or Suezmax category (source: Clarksons). Further encouragement is emerging within longer term time charters. The number of time charter opportunities is increasing and the duration are getting longer. Previous cycles have shown that the time charter market should develop further and should provide optionality and opportunity for owners as the cycle unwinds. The large crude tanker market is therefore well positioned to continue a multi-year upcycle based on strong fundamentals. Sequential quarterly improvement in freight rates may be challenging given the in-built seasonality hard wired into crude tanker markets. Seasonal factors tend to reduce cargo volumes during Q2 and Q3 (owing to refinery maintenance programmes  lower energy consumption during northern hemisphere spring  inventory planning etc). So far in the second quarter of 2023  the Euronav VLCC non scrubber fleet in the Tankers International Pool earned ~ USD 67 255 per day and 62% of the available days have been fixed. Euronav's Suezmax fleet trading on the spot market has earned ~ USD 62 000 per day on average with 51% of the available days fixed. DISTRIBUTION TO SHAREHOLDERS Full Year 2022 Dividend The Supervisory Board outlined with the full year results on 31 March 2023 a proposal to the Annual Shareholders' Meeting of 17 May 2023 to distribute a full year gross return in the amount of USD 1.10 per share to all shareholders. This payout will be a combination of a dividend and mainly a repayment from the share issue premium. COUPON 32 & 33: Ex-dividend date 1 June 2023 Record date 2 June 2023 Payment date 13 June 2023 Q1 2023 Dividend The Supervisory Board is proposing a dividend of USD 0.70 per share to reflect both the strong fundamentals attributes of the crude tanker market but also the robust operational leverage that the Euronav platform has to these market conditions. COUPON 34: Ex-dividend date 8 June 2023 Record date 9 June 2023 Payment date 20 June 2023 Euronav shareholders will therefore receive USD 1.80 dividend per share during calendar Q2 2023 reflecting the Supervisory Board's confidence in the company and tanker sector's capability of delivering strong freight markets for the foreseeable future. SUSTAINABILITY UPDATE In January 2023  Euronav was included in the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index (GEI) for the sixth year  since the Index was established in 2018.
