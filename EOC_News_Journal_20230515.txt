This covers 60 domestic markets and includes 100 currencies.With this move  Overbond AI plans to “generate a robust European fixed-income trading data set ” aimed at plugging the gap in the fixed income markets in Europe that continue to be challenges for traders.Overbond uses six months of historical data to train its AI model. The firm said its combination with Clearstream transaction data would create “the most robust European AI training data set available for the benefit of a better informed fixed income in Europe”.The fixed income markets have typically been heavily over the counter and manual in past years and for this reason the space lacks transparency. While Europe is on the cusp of implementing a consolidated tape for bonds  until regulators do so the industry remains reliant on data aggregation services such as these.Vuk Magdelinic  chief executive of Overbond  said: “Complete and accurate data is a foundational tool for achieving consistent profitability in the bond markets. Incorporating Clearstream data into the training set for Overbond AI is a game-changer. It allows us to create a great tool for traders of European debt and enables them to automate up to 40% of their trades using Overbond.”,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.33,0.12,0.55,True,English,"['Deutsche Börse European fixed income data', 'automated bond trading service', 'Overbond', 'robust European fixed-income trading data set', 'robust European AI training data set', 'new fixed income data service', 'institutional fixed income capital markets', 'European fixed-income transaction data', 'settlement-level fixed-income transaction data', 'AI quantitative analytics provider', 'fixed income markets', 'automated bond trading', 'AI-aggregated data feeds', 'data aggregation services', 'Bond Liquidity Data', 'Deutsche Börse', 'Clearstream transaction data', 'training set', 'European debt', 'bond markets', 'historical data', 'accurate data', 'Clearstream data', 'AI model', '60 domestic markets', 'Overbond AI', '170 million transactions', 'six months', 'past years', 'consolidated tape', 'Vuk Magdelinic', 'chief executive', 'foundational tool', 'consistent profitability', 'great tool', 'Overbond customers', 'agreement', 'partnership', '100 currencies', 'move', 'gap', 'challenges', 'traders', 'firm', 'combination', 'benefit', 'informed', 'counter', 'reason', 'space', 'transparency', 'cusp', 'bonds', 'regulators', 'industry', 'Complete', 'game-changer', 'trades']",2023-05-15,2023-05-15,thetradenews.com

The agreement will provide Overbond customers with market insights on instrument liquidity and trading activity through a fixed-income post-trade data set on Eurobonds settled by Clearstream.In the fixed-income trading space  data gaps remain a challenge for efficient  profitable fixed income trading and automation. This is especially true in Europe  where transparency in fixed-income instruments hardly exists. Amidst this broad data gap  bond desks may use and aggregate any existing but incomplete data sources available in the market.However  aggregating the available data into executable prices and liquidity measures requires sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud-based processing. Most bond trading desks lack the resources and expertise to do this in-house. Overbond partners with the world's largest exchanges and capital markets data providers to bring cloud-based AI aggregated data and automated trading solutions to fixed-income trading desks around the globe.Through the partnership with Deutsche Börse and Clearstream  Overbond will gain access to settlement-level fixed-income transaction data derived from the 170 million transactions that Clearstream processes annually across 100 currencies and 60 domestic markets. As the bond market is an over-the-counter market and most bonds are still traded over the phone  the addition of settlement-layer records significantly supplements the data sourced from electronic platforms.Overbond utilises six months of historical data to train its AI model  in order to generate pre-trade pricing and liquidity analytics. Combining Clearstream transaction data for European instruments with data from Overbond partners that provide binding quote data from all-to-all trading platforms will create the most robust European AI training data set available for the benefit of a better informed fixed-income trading in the EU.Story continues""Complete and accurate data is a foundational tool for achieving consistent profitability in the bond markets. Incorporating Clearstream data into the training set for Overbond AI is a game-changer. It allows us to create a great tool for traders of European debt and enables them to automate up to 40% of their trades using Overbond "" said Vuk Magdelinic  CEO of Overbond.""This partnership is a great milestone for the fixed-income industry as it combines our bond settlement data with Overbond's AI and cloud-based technology "" said Alireza Dorfard  Head of Market Data + Services at Deutsche Börse. ""It is in line with our ongoing efforts to collaborate with partners on providing state-of-the-art solutions in financial markets.""""Being at the heart of the Eurobond market  Europe's largest securities market  it is Clearstream's mission to increase transparency and therefore efficiency for all participants. This partnership is a great step on this journey  providing the market with comprehensive  up-to-date and high-quality bond settlement data "" added Guido Wille  Head of Eurobonds Business at Clearstream.Overbond AI will use this data set to generate a robust European fixed-income trading data set and enhance the precision of Overbond liquidity scoring  risk tiering and margin modeling―all of which will be available to Clearstream clients.About OverbondOverbond is a developer of process-redefining  AI-driven data and analytics and trade automation solutions for the global fixed income markets.

This trend confirms the strong value of our product and gives us confidence in the timing of future expected positive royalties and sales-based payments that will be directed to repay the Company’s debt and fuel the future development of the Company in rare diseases.“For the quarter ended March 2023  TWYMEEG gross sales in Japan increased 23% to JPY 0.9 billion (EUR 6.2 million) 3 over the prior quarter sales of JPY 0.8 billion (EUR 5.5 million) 3 as reported by Sumitomo.over the prior quarter sales of JPY 0.8 billion (EUR 5.5 million) as reported by Sumitomo.

These factors have resulted in a much higher increase in demand for TWYMEEG than expected by Sumitomo  and thus inventories are temporarily tight. Sumitomo is working diligently to increase capacity over the summer.For its FY 2023  Sumitomo announced a forecast for TWYMEEG of JPY 4.2 billion 2 (EUR 28.9 million) 3 which would represent a 90% increase over FY 2022 TWYMEEG gross sales.(EUR 28.9 million) which would represent a 90% increase over FY 2022 TWYMEEG gross sales.
