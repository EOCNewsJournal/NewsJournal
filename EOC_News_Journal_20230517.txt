But each year this pyramid is usually crowned with at least one big result for a major masterpiece; a kind of apex that is missing so far this year‚Äù.The market holds its breathIt could be argued that this breaks somewhat with a tradition established by Christie's. In recent years Fran√ßois Pinault's auction house has accustomed the art market to a very major result in its New York May sales:In May 2019  Jeff Koons became the world's most expensive living artist with his sculpture Rabbit (1986) selling for $91.1 million.In May 2020  the sales were postponed due to the health crisis.In May 2021  Pablo Picasso's Woman seated near a window (Marie-Th√©r√®se) (1932) crossed the symbolic threshold of $100 million for the first time in two years when it fetched $103 million.In May 2022  Andy Warhol's  Shot sage blue Marilyn (1964)  from the Thomas Ammann Collection  fetched the second highest-ever auction result for a work of art when it was acquired by Larry Gagosian for $195 million.At its major 20th Century Art sale on May 11  2023  Christie's best result was just $43.5 million  hammered for a canvas by Henri Rousseau (aka Le Douanier) painted the year of his death. It's a resounding new auction record for this artist who was particularly fond of Picasso  but as a peak for this prestigious sale  it seems almost too modest.Does this indicate a loss of momentum after the flurry of astonishing records hammered last fall during the sale of the Paul G. Allen Collection when Christie's sold five lots above the $100 million threshold in a single evening?‚Ä¶The most spectacular results of the evening were hammered for two works from the Paul G. Allen Collection that were not included in last fall's sale. The first was Georgia O'Keeffe's Black Iris VI (1936)  estimated at $5 - 7 million and which fetched $21.1 million (including fees). When it last went to auction in 1998  it sold for $1.1 million  almost twenty times less. The other was David Hockney's early work Blossom  Woldgate (2009)  also estimated at $5 - 7 million  which climbed to $19.4 million.Guarantees‚Ä¶ but not of performanceOf the 70 lots offered by Christie's New York on May 11  2023  only 33 were not guaranteed. Increasingly common in major art sales these days  all the works in the S. I. Newhouse Collection and the Paul G. Allen Collection  (as well as many others from prestigious collections including the Alan and Dorothy Press Collection) benefited from sale guarantees.For these lots Christie's issues the following notice: ‚ÄúOn occasion  Christie's has a direct financial interest in the outcome of the sale of certain lots consigned for sale. This will usually be where it has guaranteed to the Seller that whatever the outcome of the auction  the Seller will receive a minimum sale price for the work. This is known as a minimum price guarantee. This is such a lot.‚ÄùIn the spring of 2022  30% of the lots in Christie's 20th Century Art session were subject to guarantees (17 out of the 56 offered  including two in the sale of the Anne H. Bass Collection). This year  the same auction house guaranteed 52% of the lots. However  the multiplication of such sale guarantees does not necessarily ensure a better performance. In total  in its May 11  2023 sale  Christie's took a total of $506.6 million compared with $832.2 million in the same session last year.Images : [ https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/05/image1-henri-le-douanier-rousseau-the-flemish-1910-43-5-million-at-christies-ny-may-11-2023.jpeg ][ https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/05/image2-top-15-artists-auction-turnover-christies-ny-may-11-2023.png ]Copyright 1987-2023 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to c ontact our E conometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: econometrics@artprice.comTry our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demoSubscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

We were again able to achieve strong operational growth and at the same time significantly increased our profitability. This is also a key element of our differentiation in the industry ‚Äì we combine ambitious growth with a stable and continuous improvement in profitability. We are continuing on this path  which we are the only company in the industry to pursue to date.The strong organic growth in the first quarter resulted from continued global growth in demand for fuel cell solutions and the increasing market penetration of our products. This is based on the assumptions of constantly rising (off-grid) demand for energy  continued motivation to reduce dependency on and the use of fossil fuels from society and policy makers  and the rapidly growing global acceptance of the sustainable green energy technologies necessary to achieve long-term climate targets. The easing of global supply chain bottlenecks and the price adjustments we made to our products in fiscal year 2022 resulted in a significant increase in profitability.We were able to realize important milestones in our growth strategy in the first quarter  for both the technological and the regional expansion of our business. The pace of growth in the US is incredibly high  and comparably gratifying in Europe and Canada. In Asia  we are still seeing the after-effects of the pandemic in our business development activities and even project postponements in Singapore. Nevertheless  not least due to the current order backlog from India  we can also expect significant growth in Asia in 2023.We are also on track with setting up production in India. The Indian army placed an initial major order in March and further projects are in the pipeline.We have largely completed the build-up of production capacities at the site in Brunnthal  but are still experiencing delays at the Romanian site in Cluj due to outstanding permits for the conversion measures.The technology transfer we reached an agreement on at the end of March in the area of direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) and the continuation of the decade-long development partnership for hydrogen products with Johnson Matthey (JM) represent a particular enrichment for our company. By acquiring JM‚Äôs equipment and technology for the production of membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) for direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs)  we are adding a key component to our core competence. With this move  we are securing market and technology leadership in DMFCs and the supply chain. We expect significant cost advantages here in the medium term. JM is an ideal partner with regard to hydrogen fuel cells. Together  the two companies are thus accelerating the development of high-performance  low-cost core components. The new development and production site planned in the UK is a key element in this process.Overall  we are extremely pleased with the course of business in the first quarter and sense the continuing momentum of demand in both the Clean Energy and Clean Power Management segments. Over the course of the year  we expect demand to continue to increase in the main regional markets  with significant growth impetus expected from North America. We therefore plan to strengthen our presence in the important US market in the second half of the year. We will make every effort to further accelerate both our regional expansion and our lead in technology.‚ÄùDevelopment of orders and salesThe order book amounted to EUR 34 809 thousand in the reporting period. Accordingly  the order backlog increased to EUR 81 616 thousand as of March 31  2023 (December 31  2022: EUR 74 176 thousand).In the period from January 1 to March 31  2023  the SFC Energy Group generated significant growth in sales of 53.3% to EUR 27 454 thousand (Q1/2022: EUR 17 905 thousand). This positive development resulted from strong organic growth in both the Clean Energy segment and the Clean Power Management segment. From a regional perspective  North America delivered the strongest growth in sales  increasing by 85.6%. The North America region‚Äôs contribution to Group sales increased significantly to 50.5% (Q1/2022: 41.8%).Sales by segments in EUR thousand Q1/2023 Q1/2022 Clean Energy 17 764 12 279 Clean Power Management 9 690 5 627 Gesamt 27 454 17 905Development of the segmentsSales in the Clean Energy segment increased by 44.7% to EUR 17 764 thousand in the first quarter compared to EUR 12 279 thousand in the same quarter of the previous year. Sales of fuel cell solutions for industrial applications  which made the largest contribution to segment sales  increased significantly again in the reporting quarter. Sales to the segment‚Äôs industrial customers increased by around 75% compared to the same period of the previous year. By contrast  sales to customers in the public safety sector and in the area of private applications remained below the level of the previous year. The Clean Energy segment  whose share of Group sales decreased slightly to 64.7% in the reporting quarter (Q1/2022: 68.6%)  remained the segment with the highest sales. By contrast  the Clean Power Management segment‚Äôs share of Group sales increased to 35.3% (Q1/2022: 31.4%). Sales in this segment increased significantly by 72.2% to EUR 9 690 thousand in the reporting quarter  compared to EUR 5 627 thousand the previous year. The increase was due to strong demand and the significant recovery from the challenging procurement environment in the same quarter of the previous year.Development of earningsThe strong organic growth in sales and the significant increase in the margin  also due to the effectiveness of the price adjustments executed in fiscal year 2022  led to a significant increase in gross profit of 82.1% to EUR 10 214 thousand in the first quarter (Q1/2022: EUR 5 608 thousand). At 37.2% (Q1/2022: 31.3%)  the resulting gross profit margin of the Group (gross profit as a percentage of sales) in the reporting quarter was significantly above the level of last year‚Äôs quarter and just above the gross profit margin for the full fiscal year 2022 (36.8%).The gross profit for the individual segments compared to the previous year is as follows:Gross profit by segment in EUR thousand Q1/2023 Q1/2022 Clean Energy 7 648 4 206 Clean Power Management 2 566 1 402 Total 10 214 5 608EBITDA adjusted for non-recurring effects increased significantly to EUR 3 347 thousand in the first quarter of 2023 (Q1/2022: EUR 809 thousand)  mainly due to the significantly higher gross profit and the lower increase in functional costs relative to sales. The adjusted EBITDA margin also increased extraordinarily compared to the previous year to 12.2% (Q1/2022: 4.5%).EBIT adjusted for non-recurring effects increased to EUR 2 151 thousand (Q1/2022: EUR -418 thousand). This resulted in an adjusted EBIT margin of 7.8% (Q1/2022: -2.3%). The first quarter closed with Group net income for the period of EUR 2 035 thousand (Q1/2022: EUR -1 178 thousand). Undiluted and diluted earnings per share according to IFRS improved to EUR 0.12 and EUR 0.11  respectively  in the reporting quarter (Q1/2022: EUR -0.08 and EUR -0.08  respectively).Balance sheetAt 69.8%  the equity ratio as of March 31  2023  was at roughly the same level of the balance sheet date in 2022 (70.3%). The net financial position (freely available cash and cash equivalents less liabilities to banks) declined to EUR 54 685 thousand as of March 31  2023 (December 31  2022: EUR 60 748 thousand).

Q1 2023 revenue and income was ‚Ç¨ 372.3 million ( -5.9% compared to Q1 2022 ) : Strong performance of non-volume related business: Technology Solutions reported ‚Ç¨27.6 million of revenue (+19.4% 1 ) thanks to the internalisation of colocation services following the migration of the Core Data Centre to Italy. Advanced Data Services reached record revenue of ‚Ç¨56.3 million (+7.0%) driven by an increased number of clients and revenue capture  as well as a strong performance of the data solutions business. Custody and Settlement registered the best quarter in Euronext‚Äôs history with revenue of ‚Ç¨64.0 million (+0.1%) supported by new fee schemes. Listing activity confirmed Euronext‚Äôs leadership in Europe  despite an unfavourable IPO market  with 12 listings. 25% of the listings were from international companies. Listing revenue was ‚Ç¨54.7 million (-1.2%)  negatively impacted by the NOK depreciation over the year. Non-volume related revenue accounted for 58% of Q1 2023 revenue (vs. 55% in Q1 2022) and covered 141% of underlying operating expenses  excluding D&A (vs. 151% in Q1 2022). Fixed income trading reported record revenue of ‚Ç¨26.2 million (+7.0%) driven by increasing interest rates. Power trading revenue grew to a record of ‚Ç¨9.8 million (+8.4%) resulting from increased market share and strong momentum in the European electricity market. Q1 2022 was marked by unprecedented volatility driven by geopolitical events  resulting in a strong negative comparison base for cash and derivatives trading related activities in Q1 2023: Clearing revenue was ‚Ç¨30.0 million (-6.0%)  due to negative comparison base. Cash trading revenue was ‚Ç¨71.7 million (-23.7%) as volumes softened against the exceptionally strong Q1 2022. Equity market share was sustained at 63.8%. Cash revenue capture averaged 0.48bps  negatively impacted by larger average order size. Euronext confirms its floor of cash equity trading average market share greater or equal to 63%  and revenue capture around 0.52bps following the migration of Borsa Italiana cash markets to Optiq ¬Æ .Adjusted EBITDA 2 was ‚Ç¨218.5 million (-13. 3 %) and a djusted EBITDA margin was58.7% (-5.0pts): Underlying operating expenses  excluding D&A  were at ‚Ç¨153.8 million (+7.1%)  resulting from continued cost discipline. Underlying operating expenses excluding D&A had been positively impacted in Q1 2022 by one-off items. Euronext reiterates its 2023 guidance for underlying operating expenses excluding D&A of ‚Ç¨630 million.Reported net income  share of the parent company shareholders  was ‚Ç¨96.5 million ( -32.9% ) : As previously announced in January 2023  Euronext incurred a ‚Ç¨36.0 million pre-tax non-underlying provision related to the termination fee of the clearing agreement with LCH SA 3 .A djus ted net income 4 was ‚Ç¨ 147 . 1 million (-10.6%)   representing the second best quarter ever after a record Q1 2022 .Adjusted EPS 5 was ‚Ç¨1.38 (-10. 7%) .Deleveraging path continued with net debt to reported EBITDA at 2.4x at the end of Q1 2023 (vs. 2.6x at end of Q4 2022)  and net debt to adjusted EBITDA at 2.1x.

This migration created measurable liquidity benefits for market participants and unlocked immediate revenue synergies. The completion of this first phase paves the way for the migration of other Borsa Italiana markets from Q4 2023. This upcoming migration will trigger the termination of the third-party trading platform contract  unlocking further cost synergies. ‚Ç¨9.7 million run-rate annual synergies were delivered in Q1 2023  primarily reflecting the successful migration of Italian cash equity markets to Optiq ¬Æ . This brings to ‚Ç¨43.7 million the cumulated run-rate annual synergies achieved at the end of Q1 2023 since the acquisition in April 2021. ‚Ç¨41.1 million of cumulated implementation costs were incurred during Q1 2023  most of which related to the ‚Ç¨36.0 million fee for the termination of the derivatives clearing agreement with LCH SA. This brings to ‚Ç¨85.3 million the cumulated implementation costs incurred at the end of Q1 2023.Following the successful migration of Italian c ash markets to Optiq ¬Æ   l aun ch of new innovative trading solutions for clients leveraging Euronext‚Äôs strengths : Euronext will launch a new dark execution facility for institutional investors by Q4 2023. This new facility will enable participants to benefit from an expanded suite of on-exchange execution models from the leading pan-European venue with the largest and deepest liquidity pool. The low latency between dark and lit executions will provide with an optimised execution experience. Clients consultations on specifications are ongoing and the launch date is expected to be announced in the coming months. Trading of non-domestic and US stocks will soon become easier for retail investors. Euronext will admit pan-European and US securities to trade on its Italian MTF GEM (Global Equity Market). Both services will benefit from a simple and efficient post trade set-up through Euronext Clearing and Euronext Securities.St√©phane Boujnah  Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Managing Board of Euronext  said: ‚ÄúThis first quarter of 2023 demonstrated the robustness of Euronext‚Äôs diversified business. We recorded a solid performance in the first quarter of 2023 despite a first quarter of 2022 that was marked by unprecedented volatility on volumes due to geopolitical events resulting in a strong comparison basis. Our performance reflects the combination of strong organic growth from our non-volume related data and technology activities  and record quarters in our fixed income and power trading businesses. We continued to operate in accordance with our cost discipline  in line with our 2023 cost guidance. Overall  this translated into the second highest adjusted net income ever  at ‚Ç¨147.1 million. The migration of Italian cash and ETF markets to our Optiq¬Æ trading platform on 27 March 2023 was a tremendous success and brought immediate benefits to Euronext trading members. This major step in the Borsa Italiana Group integration unlocked an additional ‚Ç¨9.7 million of run-rate synergies for the quarter  to reach ‚Ç¨43.7 million of cumulated run-rate synergies at the end of Q1 2023. Furthermore  the migration reinforced Euronext‚Äôs position as the venue for price formation and the leading listing venue in Europe. It demonstrated Euronext‚Äôs readiness for the remaining trading and clearing migrations to come. Going forward  we reiterate for 2023 our floor of above 63% of cash equity market share on average  and a cash trading revenue capture of around 0.52bps following the Borsa Italiana markets migration to Optiq¬Æ. Our pan-European project will also be further reinforced by the launch of a series of innovative equity trading solutions  for the benefit of institutional and retail investors. In addition  the European expansion of Euronext Clearing  starting with equities from Q4 2023  will enable us to accelerate innovation capabilities across businesses  while creating important efficiencies for clients. The upcoming milestones will enable us to create the only pan-European market infrastructure present on the entire value chain and support our ambition to shape capital markets for future generations.‚ÄùEuronext Q1 2023 financial performance In ‚Ç¨m  unless stated otherwiseThe figures in this document have not been audited or reviewed by our external auditor.

Non-volume related revenue accounted for 58% of underlying Group revenue in Q1 2023  compared to 55% in Q1 2022  reflecting the successful diversification towards non-volume related activities and strong trading activity in Q1 2022 due to volatility spikes. The underlying operating expenses excluding D&A coverage ratio by non-volume related revenue was at 141% in Q1 2023  compared to 151% in Q1 2022. Q1 2023 adjusted EBITDA Underlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation increased to ‚Ç¨153.8 million  up +7.1%  reflecting continued cost discipline. In Q1 2022  underlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation were positively impacted by relevant positive one-offs. Consequently  adjusted EBITDA for the quarter totalled ‚Ç¨218.5 million  down -13.3% compared to Q1 2022. This represents an adjusted EBITDA margin of 58.7%  down -5.0 points compared to Q1 2022 due to the decrease in volume-related revenue  which was partly offset by resilient non-trading related revenue and continued cost discipline. Q1 2023 net income  share of the parent company shareholders Depreciation and amortisation accounted for ‚Ç¨40.5 million in Q1 2023  stable compared to Q1 2022. PPA related to acquired businesses accounted for ‚Ç¨20.5 million. Adjusted operating profit was ‚Ç¨200.9 million  a -14.0% decrease compared to Q1 2022. ‚Ç¨69.7 million of non-underlying expenses  including depreciation and amortisation  were reported in Q1 2023  of which ‚Ç¨36.0 million represent the fee provisioned for the termination of the derivatives clearing agreement with LCH SA8  announced in January 2023 as part of Euronext Clearing‚Äôs expansion strategy and payable in 2024. Net financing expense for Q1 2023 was ‚Ç¨4.5 million compared to a net financing expense of ‚Ç¨9.9 million in Q1 2022. This decrease reflects higher interest income from cash held paritally offsetting the cost of issued debt. Results from equity investments amounted to ‚Ç¨8.4 million in Q1 2023  representing the contribution received from LCH SA  in which Euronext currently owns an 11.1% stake  and a dividend received from Sicovam. Income tax for Q1 2023 was ‚Ç¨33.1 million. This translated into an effective tax rate of 24.5% for the quarter (Q1 2022: ‚Ç¨52.0 million and 26.1% respectively). The reduction is linked to lower non-deductible expenses and higher non-taxable income. Share of non-controlling interests mainly relating to the Borsa Italiana Group and Nord Pool amounted to ‚Ç¨5.6 million in Q1 2023. The reported net income  share of the parent company shareholders  decreased by -32.9% for Q1 2023 compared to Q1 2022  to ‚Ç¨96.5 million  including the one-off expense related to the termination of the derivatives clearing agreement with LCH SA. This represents a reported EPS of ‚Ç¨0.90 basic and ‚Ç¨0.90 fully diluted in Q1 2023  compared to ‚Ç¨1.35 basic and ‚Ç¨1.35 fully diluted in Q1 2022. The weighted number of shares used over Q1 2023 was 106 726 832 for the basic calculation and 106 991 437 for the fully diluted calculation. Adjusted net income  share of the parent company shareholders was down -10.6% to ‚Ç¨147.1 million. Adjusted EPS (basic) was down -10.7% in Q1 2023  at ‚Ç¨1.38 per share  based on 106 726 832 shares for Q1 2023  compared to an adjusted EPS (basic) of ‚Ç¨1.54 per share in Q1 2022  based on 106 576 290 shares for Q1 2022. In Q1 2023  Euronext reported a net cash flow from operating activities of ‚Ç¨318.2 million  compared to ‚Ç¨368.6 million in Q1 2022  reflecting the lower profit before tax. Excluding the impact on working capital from Euronext Clearing and Nord Pool CCP activities  net cash flow from operating activities accounted for 86.5% of EBITDA9 in Q1 2023.

In particular  the Borsa Italiana pre-migration fee grid was more sensitive to order size than the legacy Euronext markets  with a negative impact on the overall Group revenue capture. Following the successful migration of Italian Equity and ETF markets onto Optiq¬Æ on 27 March 2023  the new fee schemes brought immediate positive impact on average revenue. Euronext also continued to guarantee best-in-class market quality. Cash equity market share over the first quarter of 2023 averaged 63.8% reflecting lower presence of real-economy flows at the start of the year before a reverse trend during the March volatility spike. Euronext confirms the floor of 63% market share and around 0.52bps yield after the Borsa Italiana markets migration as announced on 10 February 2023. In addition  the migration of Italian cash markets onto Optiq¬Æ generated an immediate uplift of market share for Italian cash markets and brought immediate benefits to trading members through enhanced liquidity. These concrete market improvements demonstrate the added value of connecting local markets to the Euronext model. Concretely  EBBO12 setting has increased by around 20% following the migration. Overall  Euronext reinforced its position as the venue of price formation throughout the quarter. EBBO setting increased consistently and Euronext‚Äôs best-in-class market quality was even more evident during volatility spikes. The stronger position of Euronext in the European cash trading ecosystem now allows the Group to launch the first set of new innovative trading services. These include a new institutional low-latency dark offering and an enhanced offer for retail investors with the addition of pan-European and US securities to Euronext‚Äôs Italian MTF GEM (Global Equity Market). Both services will benefit from a simple and efficient clearing set-up through Euronext Clearing.

Euronext has removed the exceptional items line from its financial statements.

The ‚Ç¨150 million of implementation costs to deliver on the ‚ÄòGrowth for Impact 2024‚Äô strategic plan targets are therefore considered as non-underlying items and have been withdrawn from the underlying recurring costs. The computation of adjusted net income and earnings per share has been adjusted accordingly.

These items can include: integration or double run costs of significant projects  restructuring costs and costs related to acquisitions that change the perimeter of the Group; one-off finance costs  gains or losses on sale of subsidiaries and impairments of investments: amortisation and impairment of intangible assets which are recognised as a result of acquisitions and mostly comprising customer relationships  brand names and software that were identified during purchase price allocation (PPA); tax related to non-underlying items.Adjusted operating profit as the operating profit adjusted for any non-underlying revenue and income and non-underlying costs  including PPA of acquired businesses;EBITDA as the operating profit before depreciation and amortisation;Adjusted EBITDA as the adjusted operating profit before depreciation and amortisation adjusted for any non-underlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation;EBITDA margin as EBITDA divided by total revenue and income;Adjusted EBITDA margin as adjusted EBITDA  divided by total revenue and income;Adjusted net income  as the net income  share of the parent company shareholders  adjusted for any non-underlying items and related tax impact.

This acquisition gives Lumibird a strategic advantage in high power semiconductor and fibre lasers and opens up new markets.Convergent Photonics has over 50 years of experience in the design and manufacture of semiconductor lasers and laser diode packaging  as well as the design and manufacture of high-power fibre lasers for the medical sector (urology  surgery  etc.). 80 qualified and experienced people  divided between Italy and the USA  will join the Lumibird Group. The Convergent activities had a turnover of 15 million euros in 2022 for a negative EBITDA of 1.5 million euros.This acquisition is a new step in the group's investment strategy and has a double strategic interest by strengthening its strategic positioning in semiconductors and very high power fibre lasers  and by opening up new market segments.Strengthening sovereignty with semiconductors and very high power fibre lasersThis acquisition will enable Lumibird to further strengthen its sovereignty in the field of lasers and optronics. It also completes  with the arrival of the semiconductor  the strategic investments already made in optical fibre and derived components. It will enable Lumibird to become independent in the supply of critical components and will give it greater capacity for innovation in materials and components  while internalising the margins on expensive components.Opening up new marketsThe integration of these activities will enable the development of the medical branch in markets other than ophthalmology  where the group is already in a leadership position. In total synergy with the photonics branch  which will supply high-powered lasers  the path to applications in Urology and Gynaecology is open.The parties expect the transaction to be completed in the second half of 2023  subject to regulatory approvals in Italy and the US.Lumibird will finance its acquisition through its available cash or by drawing on the bank lines available to the group  in compliance with the covenants.""Marc Le Flohic  Chairman and CEO of Lumibird  said: ""This acquisition strengthens several of our technological pillars and is perfectly in line with Lumibird's strategy of verticalization and sovereignty. It allows us to vertically integrate critical semiconductor technologies  to strengthen our sovereignty over laser technologies in Europe  and to diversify into high growth markets.Giovanni Negri  CEO of Prima Industrie commented: ‚ÄúAfter many years of being successfully active in the development and production of laser sources  Prima Industrie has decided to dispose of laser source business unit  Convergent  in order to focus on main business of sheet metal machinery and systems.

The French company is now well established and its solution has been used for many years by leading players in the banking  insurance and retail sectors. Through its network of partners  Kleverware is present in France  as well as in Switzerland and Benelux.A new offering at the heart of cloud infrastructure security challenges: CIEMIn early 2023  WALLIX and Kleverware announced a tech alliance to strengthen cloud infrastructure security  a booming market up 20% in 2023 and estimated at $600 billion.The Kleverware solution represents a significant technological asset that naturally complements WALLIX's PAM4ALL offering to give clients visibility over user access rights within their organization and ecosystem  in accordance with IT risk management regulations related to digital access  identity and data in their sector.Thus  strengthened by Kleverware  WALLIX's offering will enable companies to migrate to the cloud with visibility over their user access rights and an ability to flexibly adapt them in accordance with current regulations and uses to limit their attack surface.The strategic value of this positioning is enhanced by the fact that CIEM technology (Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management) is emerging as the go-to standard for access management and application of the ‚Äúleast privilege‚Äù principle in cloud infrastructures.A new strategic milestone in the Unicorn 25 planThe acquisition of Kleverware is fully in line with the strategic and financial objectives set out in the Unicorn 25 plan:expansion of the product offering and entry into the strategic identity and access governance (IAG) segment  which is growing at an average annual rate of 12.5% and estimated to be worth $4.3 billion according to Gartner Group;strengthening of the client portfolio with key accounts in the core banking and insurance sectors  and across Europe in Switzerland and Benelux;ramp-up of the profitable growth trajectory with an expected average annual growth rate of Kleverware's turnover of almost 75% over the 2022-2025 period and a long-term operating margin target of over 15%  in line with the Group's ambition.An immediately accretive transaction with a long-term trajectoryFounded by Bertrand Aug√© and Arnaud Fl√©chard  Kleverware is targeting turnover of ‚Ç¨1 million and operating breakeven in 2023.WALLIX has acquired the entire share capital of Kleverware for an initial price of ‚Ç¨250 000 paid in cash  with possible earnouts subject to the presence of the Kleverware founding shareholders and Kleverware's performance.This transaction therefore combines the long-term commitment of the founders with a phased payment of the acquisition price. Kleverware will be consolidated in the WALLIX financial statements from May 17  2023. The existing tech alliance with Kleverware will facilitate the integration of the company and provide immediate revenue synergies.Jean-No√´l de Galzain  Chairman-CEO and founder of WALLIX  made the following comments: ‚ÄúWe are pleased to welcome Kleverware to the WALLIX Group. This transaction is fully in line with the Company's ambition to expand its offering  support organizations in their digital transformation and become a European leader in access  data and digital identity cybersecurity. The combination of PAM and IAG expertise will strengthen WALLIX's position in the cloud infrastructure security market. This is a key step in fulfilling our ambition to build an innovative security-by-design solution for the digital world in compliance with standards and regulations of our clients' businesses.‚ÄùBertrand Aug√©  Kleverware CEO  said: ‚ÄúWALLIX and Kleverware share a common ambition to build a more secure digital world that meets the needs of businesses.

In light of the market environment that has been created with the consequences of Russia-Ukraineconflict  the energy crisis and the inflationary impact on prices in almost all merchandise sectors  the highlights of FY22 for Clabo are the double digit growth in revenues and marginality  the return to profit after 3 years and  generally speaking  the promptness and effectiveness of the recovery actions implemented by management that enabled a rapid return to pre-pandemiclevels of profitability  also recording a record year in 2022 in terms of sales and margins. Getting to the point  revenues settled at Euro 51.4 m  up 16% from previous year (Euro 44.2 m) predominantly due to foreign sales exceeding 75%  particularly in non-EUareas  and the continuous R&D activity  able to develop  produce and offer customers innovative products both in design and in the use of materials and technological solutions. VoP is up from Euro 50.8 m in 2021 to Euro 59.3 m in 2022 (+17% YoY) with EBITDA reaching Euro 8.7 m (vs. Euro 6.0 m in FY21)  while EBITDA margin stood at 15% vs. 12% of our projections  due principally to increased sales volumes and containment of structural costs. Except for raw materials  which have risen sharply in price for the reasons already described above  and miscellaneous operating expenses  all other items of operating costs see their incidence fall in relation to VoP  thanks to the efficiency and profitability recovery processes put in place by the management of the three companies (Clabo Spa  Qingdao Clabo Easy Best Refrigeration Equipment Co. Ltd and Howard McCray Enterprises LLC). Net income figure confirmed the growth process and totalized Euro 0.89 m  recording a significant YoY increase compared to the loss recorded in FY21 (Euro 0.9 m). Regarding the balance sheet side  net debt came in at Euro 42.4 m  strictly in line with Euro 41.4 m of previous year  and Equity stood at Euro 10.9 m (Euro 8.8 m as of 31/12/2021). Outlook remain positive in 1Q23. A time series analysis of the Group's performance in the first quarter 2023 confirms the excellent earnings performance relative to the current year  along with exceeding the total revenues of the pre-pandemic period. Both in terms of total revenues and Ebitda  1Q23 period represents the record quarter since the listing year (2015) with confirmed orders of Euro 17.7 m  +12% from 1Q22; Growth in the U.S. market continues in both food retail and BPG segments (Bar  Patisseries and Ice Cream)  and the performance of the market in Asia in particular is highlighted by the recovery of the Chinese domestic market. Looking at the evolution of operating results over the four years under review  it can be seen that the macroeconomic phenomena described above had a significant impact on the group's performance. However  the recovery actions implemented by management have enabled a rapid return to pre-pandemic levels of revenues and profitability  recording a record year in 2022 in terms of sales  margins  and profits. The Group continues to see signs of confidence from its customers that point to a forecast for 2023 growth in revenues and margins  compared to the year just ended. Management is also confident that the production optimization processes at the Jesi and Philadelphia plants  the rationalization of the organizational structure and the re-pricing of a wide range of products carried out during 2022 will lead to further benefits in terms of profitability in the next fiscal year as well. Estimate revision and valuation. Given the above we finetuned our revenues estimates  with the aim of confirming the growth process. We now expect sales growth of 11% in FY23 (9% previously) and 10% in the years to follow and we also increased profitability to reflect the structural improvement in margins from 2023 onward. Updating our DCF and multiple based valuation model for new estimates and up-to-date market data  we obtain a target price of Euro 4.38 p.s. (Euro 3.48 p.s. previously)  providing for a potential upside of 124%. At our TP the stock would be trading at FY23-24 EV/EBITDA multiples of 9.3x and 8.3x.

6:30 PM 3 Equity Research UPDATE NOTE FY22 Euronext Growth Milan Major events occurred during 2022 With regard to the significant events that occurred during the year  it seems appropriate to mention  on a preliminary basis  what occurred in July 2022 when the company Clabo S.p.A. was notified of a precautionary seizure order  issued by the GIP of the Court of Ancona  aimed at the confiscation of Euro 1 684 thousand. This measure was taken on the basis of the crime hypotheses pursuant to Articles 110 and 316 bis of the Italian Criminal Code (so-called ""Misappropriation"") and Articles 110 and 648 ter 1 paragraph 2 of the Italian Criminal Code (so-called""Self-Money Laundering"")  crimes which  according to the theory of the Public Prosecutor who conducted the investigation and endorsed by the GIP  were allegedly committed by the directors Pierluigi Bocchini and Paolo Bracceschi  at the time of the facts respectively Chairman and Director of Clabo S.p.A. Specifically  the order in question referred to the alleged use in fraud of funds paid in November 2018 by Simest to Clabo S.p.A. as financing for the company's development plan in the United States of America. The device  issued on July 4  2022  and notified to the company on July 18  2022  had the effect  as early as July 13  2022  of immediately suspending all of Clabo S.p.A.'s lines of credit  as well as its current accounts and cash and cash equivalents existing as of the date  up to the amount indicated. In addition  the issuance of a similar measure by the judicial authority constituted a ""Significant Event"" for the purposes of the framework agreement signed with a part of Clabo's Creditor Class aimed at regulating the refinancing of a significant portion of Clabo's medium-term debt  empowering creditors to request the acceleration of repayments of outstanding loans  an even more serious consequence for the Company. Clabo S.p.A.  in fulfillment of the disclosure requirements of the Italian Stock Exchange regulations  took steps to give ample and detailed information to the market about what had happened causing. As was widely predictable  a negative reaction from investors and a collapse of the share price by more than 11% in a single session (loss of capitalization of about ‚Ç¨2 million). Already on July 29  2022  on appeal to the Ancona Review Court  the Company obtained the revocation of the seizure on about 80% of the amount. On December 13  2022  the Cassation Court also annulled without referral the surviving part of the order  ending the precautionary proceedings. In the meantime  Clabo S.p.A. had to negotiate a ""waiver"" with its financial creditors in order to be able to restore the operation of its credit lines  obtaining it on November 29  2022. In the time between the suspension of the credit facilities and their restoration  the Company had to operate with enormous difficulties  unable to meet its payment commitments with its suppliers  slowing down the production process and consequently deliveries to customers. The costs for consulting services alone  necessary for the management of the judicial affair and its consequences on the management level  amounted to more than 300 thousand euros  in addition to the reputational and image damage that cannot be quantified for a listed company.

Reward Gateway offers a unified suite of solutions ranging from employee savings  rewards & recognition to well-being and corporate social animation  empowering Human Resources departments to build the right combination of engagement tools.Reward Gateway is a fast-growing company that has successfully built a strong  highly profitable and sustainable business model. This acquisition  amounting to ¬£1.15bn1 and valuing Reward Gateway at 20x EV/EBITDA 23e2  marks a major milestone in Edenred‚Äôs Beyond 22-25 strategic plan. By consolidating Reward Gateway‚Äôs strong leading positions and extending its geographical scope in selected key countries  Edenred will accelerate the strengthening of its Employee Benefits value proposition in line with its mission to be the most trusted global Employee Benefits & Engagement platform.Bertrand Dumazy  Chairman and CEO at Edenred  said: ‚ÄúWe are pleased to announce the acquisition of Reward Gateway and are looking forward to welcoming their teams in the Edenred world. By integrating this leading employee engagement platform  we are substantially extending our employee benefits offer to provide HR managers with a comprehensive range of solutions helping them make their organization more attractive to talents. While Reward Gateway is bringing us leading positions in the UK and in Australia  as well as a promising presence in the US market  we will be looking at scaling Reward Gateway outside of its current footprint in selected key countries. With a business model based on an efficient and fully scalable SaaS3 platform  Reward Gateway has been consistently delivering strong double-digit growth and high margins. The combination of our people  our solutions  our customer bases and our technologies offers high potential for synergies. This acquisition is a unique opportunity for Edenred to accelerate on the implementation of its Beyond strategy. A decisive move matching our mission to be the most trusted global employee benefits and engagement platform.‚ÄùNick Burns  CEO at Reward Gateway  said: ‚ÄúWe are extremely proud to join Edenred. The combination of Reward Gateway‚Äôs operations and technology with Edenred‚Äôs position as a global market leader across 1 million corporate clients in 45 countries  offers an accelerated path to achieve our mission of ‚Äòmaking the world a better place to work‚Äô. As we will aim at a single unified platform  we will benefit from economies of scale to build tailored solutions for specific markets. Bringing together our collective strengths  from commercial reach to product innovation and advanced technology  will be putting us in a position to provide HR leaders with a truly market-beating solution.‚ÄùReward Gateway  a highly performing businessFounded in 2006 in the UK  Reward Gateway is a leading SaaS Employee Engagement platform provider. With more than 4 000 customers and 8 million employees using its solutions in the UK  in Australia and in the US  Reward Gateway is the go-to partner for HR leaders to build better  stronger and more resilient organizations  to make the world a better place to work. Encompassing various engagement tools  from market-leading employee savings  reward and recognition  communications  surveys and well-being solutions  Reward Gateway‚Äôs offer provides HR managers with full flexibility to engage  motivate and retain their employees.Through a holistic and modular platform  Reward Gateway helps create a best-in-class streamlined employee experience fully customized for each organization. Thanks to open API integrations with more than 40 HRIS4  payroll  collaborative tools  benefits and third-party software providers  Reward Gateway offers to employers an automated experience.Reward Gateway has enjoyed continued double-digit revenue growth and consistently high profitability over the recent years. It forecasts to generate ¬£95m revenue and ¬£45m EBITDA in FY2023.Enriching Edenred value proposition in the fast-growing Employee Engagement marketThrough the acquisition of Reward Gateway  Edenred accesses an already sizeable market with great penetration potential and opportunity to expand further. In the UK and Australia  where Reward Gateway is the market leader  the employee engagement markets  which represent a combined value of ¬£1.9bn in revenue  is still vastly underpenetrated and expected to grow by more than 10% per annum5. The US market alone  where Reward Gateway has started building a position  is worth ¬£4.5bn in revenue.Structural trends that have emerged in a post-pandemic context  such as an acceleration in remote working and the war for talent  have put greater emphasis on employee engagement  leading HR leaders to leverage benefits and engagement solutions as differentiating factors. On top of that  growing considerations on purchasing power have considerably accelerated the focus on Employee Savings solutions.A strategic acquisition fostering Edenred‚Äôs mission to be the everyday platform for people at workEdenred has successfully extended its portfolio into non-Meal & Food benefits over the years. The Group has notably developed a leading offer in Employee Benefits & Savings platforms in 17 countries  reinforced by the recently announced acquisition of GOintegro in Latin America.The acquisition of Reward Gateway marks a major milestone in the roll-out of the Beyond 22-25 strategic plan putting Edenred in the best position to be the most trusted global Employee Benefits & Engagement platform. By widening its Employee Savings offer  integrating new services such as well-being  and expanding its value proposition to Rewards & Recognition solutions  Reward Gateway provides Edenred with a unique opportunity to further accelerate in Beyond Food while enlarging its footprint by entering new promising and fast-growing markets such as the USA and Australia.A transaction with sizeable expected synergiesIn addition to integration synergies  the planned roll-out of Reward Gateway in 6 major Edenred countries (Belgium  France  Germany  Italy  Romania  Spain) will considerably increase Edenred‚Äôs addressed market and drive additional operating revenue. Business synergies will also be driven by boosted cross-selling opportunities with existing clients from both companies and further improve client retention through platform solutions and embedded experience.Reward Gateway is currently held by funds managed by private equity firms Abry Partners and Castik Capital. The acquisition will be fully paid in cash by Edenred  to be financed by a ‚Ç¨1bn bridge loan to be later refinanced on the debt capital markets as well as by ‚Ç¨0.3bn from available cash at hand. The acquisition will be accretive to Group EPS from 2024 onwards. This value-creative transaction will be strongly accretive on a standalone basis and Edenred will in addition benefit from a strong upside in terms of cost  technological and commercial synergies.The transaction is expected to close within a couple of days. Reward Gateway will be fully consolidated in Edenred‚Äôs financial statements as from closing date.Brian St. Jean  Partner and Austin Heiman  Principal at Abry Partners said: ‚ÄúIt was a pleasure supporting the Reward Gateway team over the last two years as we partnered with Castik Capital to help transform the business into a leading global SaaS engagement platform. We believe the business is poised to continue building on its market-leading position and we are confident that Edenred is the right partner to further accelerate the company‚Äôs exceptional performance.‚ÄùMichael Phillips  Partner at Castik Capital said: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôd like to thank the Reward Gateway team as well as Abry Partners for the great collaboration over the past two years. During our partnership  Reward Gateway significantly invested in building out its self-service SaaS offering and further strengthened its position in the UK  Australia and the US. We wish Reward Gateway all the best in the future and will closely follow the continued strong development of the business within Edenred.‚Äù‚ñ¨‚ñ¨About EdenredEdenred is a leading digital platform for services and payments and the everyday companion for people at work  connecting 52 million users and 2 million partner merchants in 45 countries via close to 1 million corporate clients.Edenred offers specific-purpose payment solutions for food (such as meal benefits)  incentives (such as gift cards  employee engagement platforms)  mobility (such as multi-energy  maintenance  toll  parking and commuter solutions) and corporate payments (such as virtual cards).True to the Group‚Äôs purpose  ‚ÄúEnrich connections.

The Euronext-listed developer  operator and owner has a current portfolio of 10.9 million sqm as at end of Q1 2023 and a development landbank of 20.7 million sqm as at end of Q1 2023 across its markets. It aims to almost double the total GLA of industrial and logistics space in its portfolio with new developments through to 2030  generating annual rental income of ‚Ç¨1 billion across a 20 million sqm portfolio.CTP entered the German market in 2022 through the circa ‚Ç¨800 million takeover and delisting of Deutsche Industrie REIT-AG (""DIR"")  which had a 1.6 million sqm GLA portfolio on 3.9 million sqm of land. CTP now has a team of 50 across three offices in Germany and 28 000 sqm of industrial and logistics space under development in Bremen  with a 208 000 sqm landbank. The ‚Ç¨300 million investment programme is split between new build and acquisitions  with CTP looking to develop over 300 000 sqm of new space each year through to 2030.CTP has secured two new sites in Germany in Q1 2023: the 80 000 sqm CTPark Weiden  with 44 000 sqm GLA increasing to 60 000 sqm following a sustainable refurbishment and uprgrade; and CTPark Rastatt  comprising 60 000 sqm of land  which has the potential for the development of 33 000 sqm GLA of Grade A warehouse space.In Poland  CTP currently has a 274 000 sqm GLA portfolio as at the end of Q1 2023 and a 2.3 million sqm landbank  with around 453 000 sqm of space under construction as at the end of Q1 2023.

In line with CTP's wider approach to sustainability  it plans install photovoltaic power cells  capable of generating a total of up to 50MWp across its assets in Poland by 2025. As part of its expansion CTP will be growing its 70-strong team in Poland.Remon Vos  CEO of CTP  said:""CTP sees huge potential for further growth in the industrial and logistics markets in Germany and Poland  as a combination of strong economic fundamentals  emerging global mega trends  such as the rise in nearshoring  growth in e-commerce  as well as key real estate market dynamics are continuing to drive demand for best-in-class sustainable warehouses in central and eastern Europe  as well as Germany. Having established a strong platform in both countries we now intend to grow our presence in these markets with a total of ‚Ç¨600 million investment focused on increasing our portfolio the highly sustainable  client-focused industrial and logistics space that modern occupiers demand.""CTP is seeing continued strong demand for industrial and logistics space across Central and Eastern Europe  as well as in its Western European markets in Germany  Austria and the Netherlands.

By integrating Eviden‚Äôs quantum computer emulator and ColibrITD‚Äôs quantum software on ONERA‚Äôs classical simulation platform  the project team aims to reduce carbon emissions  lower the energy footprint of high-performance computing (HPC) centers and help develop safer engines and turbines in the future.Most HPC customers are confronted with decarbonization challenges in their particular industry and a reduced product development time. In the meantime  classical simulation is facing limitations: certain complex phenomena like combustion cannot be fully simulated in a reasonable amount of time  and more computations would require more energy  defeating the initial purpose of reducing the environmental impact. A hybrid approach between classical and quantum computing would bring together faster computing capacities with improved computation precision and energy efficiency.This innovative project will give birth to the first end-to-end quantum computing combustion platform that aims to work on existing noisy and quantum computers. The project team  supported by ColibrITD‚Äôs expertise in quantum software  will develop a noise-resistant hybrid algorithm to solve differential equations using the simple use case of a flame structure in 1D. This algorithm will be integrated on Eviden‚Äôs quantum computer emulator and  thanks to Atos‚Äô deep expertise in hybrid computing  on Onera‚Äôs classical simulation platform to be able to compare both approaches and results.C√©dric Bourrasset  Global Head of HPC-AI and Quantum Computing  Eviden  Atos Group said ‚ÄúThis project has come to life thanks to Atos‚Äô innovation strategy. Atos and ColibrITD started their collaboration through Scaler  the Group‚Äôs start-up accelerator  and decided to solve the computational challenge of combustion through quantum technologies with the support of ONERA. This project is not only about algorithm research  but also to provide those industries that require combustion with a hybrid computational platform  enabling better simulation capacity and precision while improving their energy efficiency.‚ÄùLaurent Guiraud  Co-Founder and Quantum Computing R&D Lead  ColibrITD declared ‚ÄúBeing part of the VulQain project with our partners is helping accelerate the 2nd quantum revolution adoption in key industrial sectors says Dr. Laurent Guiraud. ""This project will help increase the quantum momentum for real use cases that will benefit the aerospace & defense industry and other sectors.‚ÄùAlain Refloch in charge of quantum computing at ONERA QTECH laboratory highlighted ‚ÄúToday  a lot of effort is being put into developing various qubit technologies. For ONERA  the interest of this project lies in its algorithmic orientation and the fact that the developments on this platform will be hardware-agnostic. This platform can be used for quantum education purposes and in training programs and will serve the air  space and defence technologies.‚Äù***About Eviden1Eviden designs the scope composed of Atos‚Äô digital  cloud  big data and security business lines.

By integrating Eviden‚Äôs quantum computer emulator and ColibrITD‚Äôs quantum software on ONERA‚Äôs classical simulation platform  the project team aims to reduce carbon emissions  lower the energy footprint of high-performance computing (HPC) centers and help develop safer engines and turbines in the future.Most HPC customers are confronted with decarbonization challenges in their particular industry and a reduced product development time. In the meantime  classical simulation is facing limitations: certain complex phenomena like combustion cannot be fully simulated in a reasonable amount of time  and more computations would require more energy  defeating the initial purpose of reducing the environmental impact. A hybrid approach between classical and quantum computing would bring together faster computing capacities with improved computation precision and energy efficiency.This innovative project will give birth to the first end-to-end quantum computing combustion platform that aims to work on existing noisy and quantum computers. The project team  supported by ColibrITD‚Äôs expertise in quantum software  will develop a noise-resistant hybrid algorithm to solve differential equations using the simple use case of a flame structure in 1D. This algorithm will be integrated on Eviden‚Äôs quantum computer emulator and  thanks to Atos‚Äô deep expertise in hybrid computing  on Onera‚Äôs classical simulation platform to be able to compare both approaches and results.C√©dric Bourrasset  Global Head of HPC-AI and Quantum Computing  Eviden  Atos Group said ‚ÄúThis project has come to life thanks to Atos‚Äô innovation strategy. Atos and ColibrITD started their collaboration through Scaler  the Group‚Äôs start-up accelerator  and decided to solve the computational challenge of combustion through quantum technologies with the support of ONERA. This project is not only about algorithm research  but also to provide those industries that require combustion with a hybrid computational platform  enabling better simulation capacity and precision while improving their energy efficiency.‚ÄùLaurent Guiraud  Co-Founder and Quantum Computing R&D Lead  ColibrITD declared ‚ÄúBeing part of the VulQain project with our partners is helping accelerate the 2nd quantum revolution adoption in key industrial sectors says Dr. Laurent Guiraud. ""This project will help increase the quantum momentum for real use cases that will benefit the aerospace & defense industry and other sectors.‚ÄùAlain Refloch in charge of quantum computing at ONERA QTECH laboratory highlighted ‚ÄúToday  a lot of effort is being put into developing various qubit technologies. For ONERA  the interest of this project lies in its algorithmic orientation and the fact that the developments on this platform will be hardware-agnostic. This platform can be used for quantum education purposes and in training programs and will serve the air  space and defence technologies.‚Äù***About Eviden1Eviden designs the scope composed of Atos‚Äô digital  cloud  big data and security business lines.

Lots of works fetched over $10 million on May 11  but none crossed the threshold of $50 million. Indeed la‚Ä¶,"With no ‚Äòabsolute masterpieces' on offer  there were no ‚Äòmega' results in Christie's first major prestige New York sale of 2023. Lots of works fetched over $10 million on May 11  but none crossed the threshold of $50 million. Indeed last year's peak at the same sale when Andy Warhol's Shot Sage Blue Marilyn (1964) reached $195 million now seems quite remote.Henri Le Douanier Rousseau ‚ÄìThe Flemish (1910) sold for $43.5 million at Christie's on May 11  2023[ https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/05/image1-henri-le-douanier-rousseau-the-flemish-1910-43-5-million-at-christies-ny-may-11-2023.jpeg ]Top 15 artists by auction turnover at Christie's New York on May 11  2023[ https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/05/image2-top-15-artists-auction-turnover-christies-ny-may-11-2023.png ]‚ÄúThe Art Market is a pyramid  observes thierry Ehrmann  CEO of Artmarket.com and founder of Artprice. ‚ÄúIts base remains very solid  thanks to countless exchanges recorded in all four corners of the globe  in all price ranges. But each year this pyramid is usually crowned with at least one big result for a major masterpiece; a kind of apex that is missing so far this year‚Äù.The market holds its breathIt could be argued that this breaks somewhat with a tradition established by Christie's. In recent years Fran√ßois Pinault's auction house has accustomed the art market to a very major result in its New York May sales:In May 2019  Jeff Koons became the world's most expensive living artist with his sculpture Rabbit (1986) selling for $91.1 million.In May 2020  the sales were postponed due to the health crisis.In May 2021  Pablo Picasso's Woman seated near a window (Marie-Th√©r√®se) (1932) crossed the symbolic threshold of $100 million for the first time in two years when it fetched $103 million.In May 2022  Andy Warhol's  Shot sage blue Marilyn (1964)  from the Thomas Ammann Collection  fetched the second highest-ever auction result for a work of art when it was acquired by Larry Gagosian for $195 million.At its major 20th Century Art sale on May 11  2023  Christie's best result was just $43.5 million  hammered for a canvas by Henri Rousseau (aka Le Douanier) painted the year of his death. It's a resounding new auction record for this artist who was particularly fond of Picasso  but as a peak for this prestigious sale  it seems almost too modest.Does this indicate a loss of momentum after the flurry of astonishing records hammered last fall during the sale of the Paul G. Allen Collection when Christie's sold five lots above the $100 million threshold in a single evening?‚Ä¶The most spectacular results of the evening were hammered for two works from the Paul G. Allen Collection that were not included in last fall's sale. The first was Georgia O'Keeffe's Black Iris VI (1936)  estimated at $5 - 7 million and which fetched $21.1 million (including fees). When it last went to auction in 1998  it sold for $1.1 million  almost twenty times less. The other was David Hockney's early work Blossom  Woldgate (2009)  also estimated at $5 - 7 million  which climbed to $19.4 million.Guarantees‚Ä¶ but not of performanceOf the 70 lots offered by Christie's New York on May 11  2023  only 33 were not guaranteed. Increasingly common in major art sales these days  all the works in the S. I. Newhouse Collection and the Paul G. Allen Collection  (as well as many others from prestigious collections including the Alan and Dorothy Press Collection) benefited from sale guarantees.For these lots Christie's issues the following notice: ‚ÄúOn occasion  Christie's has a direct financial interest in the outcome of the sale of certain lots consigned for sale. This will usually be where it has guaranteed to the Seller that whatever the outcome of the auction  the Seller will receive a minimum sale price for the work. This is known as a minimum price guarantee. This is such a lot.‚ÄùIn the spring of 2022  30% of the lots in Christie's 20th Century Art session were subject to guarantees (17 out of the 56 offered  including two in the sale of the Anne H. Bass Collection). This year  the same auction house guaranteed 52% of the lots. However  the multiplication of such sale guarantees does not necessarily ensure a better performance. In total  in its May 11  2023 sale  Christie's took a total of $506.6 million compared with $832.2 million in the same session last year.Images : [ https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/05/image1-henri-le-douanier-rousseau-the-flemish-1910-43-5-million-at-christies-ny-may-11-2023.jpeg ][ https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/05/image2-top-15-artists-auction-turnover-christies-ny-may-11-2023.png ]Copyright 1987-2023 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to c ontact our E conometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: econometrics@artprice.comTry our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demoSubscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

Reports Q1 2023 Financial Results and Highlights Operational ProgressHalle (Saale) / Munich  Germany  May 16  2023 ‚Äì Vivoryon Therapeutics N.V. (Euronext Amsterdam: VVY; NL00150002Q7) (Vivoryon)  a clinical stage company focused on the discovery and development of small molecule medicines to modulate the activity and stability of pathologically altered proteins  today announced financial results and corporate updates for the first quarter of 2023  ending March 31  2023.‚ÄúIn the first quarter of 2023  we continued to advance our lead program for Alzheimer‚Äôs disease  varoglutamstat  through both the VIVIAD and VIVA-MIND studies and reported further data demonstrating both strong tolerability and improvements in pathological hallmarks  synaptic function and connectivity  cognition  memory and attention in AD patients ‚Äù said Dr. Ulrich Dauer  CEO of Vivoryon. ‚ÄúAmidst steady clinical progress with varoglutamstat  we are also encouraged by the recent activity and developments in the broader AD treatment landscape  in particular the emerging clinical evidence validating our approach of targeting neurotoxic N3pE-Abeta. We believe we are well-positioned for varoglutamstat to provide an effective and much-needed therapeutic option that alleviates issues with administration for patients with this devastating disease. Vivoryon has an exciting year ahead and we look forward to reporting important safety updates later this year for our VIVA-MIND trial in the U.S. and final data from our VIVIAD study in the first quarter of next year.‚ÄùQ1 2023 and Post-Period Portfolio HighlightsVaroglutamstat Clinical Program:VIVIAD (NCT04498650) is a state-of-the-art Phase 2b study being conducted in Europe and designed to evaluate the safety  tolerability  and efficacy of varoglutamstat in 250 subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild Alzheimer‚Äôs disease (AD). In March 2023  Vivoryon provided an update on varoglutamstat clinical development for the treatment of AD at the International Conference on Alzheimer‚Äôs and Parkinson‚Äôs Diseases and related neurological disorders (AD/PD). As of the data cut-off date of January 5  2023  over 100 of the 259 participants randomized into the VIVIAD study had been treated for at least 48 weeks. Varoglutamstat showed no on-target toxicity and no clinical signs of brain swelling or hemorrhages (ARIA)  which are a limiting class side effect of Abeta antibodies and has been well-tolerated in the study to date. Both the total number of SAEs and the discontinuation rate were considerably lower than the respective numbers at the 800 mg BID varoglutamstat dose in Vivoryon‚Äôs completed Phase 2a SAPHIR study  while retaining a similar level of target inhibition (around 90%) at the dosing in both studies. Vivoryon remains on track to report the final data readout from the VIVIAD study in the first quarter of 2024.(NCT04498650) is a state-of-the-art Phase 2b study being conducted in Europe and designed to evaluate the safety  tolerability  and efficacy of varoglutamstat in 250 subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild Alzheimer‚Äôs disease (AD). VIVA-MIND (NCT03919162) is a complementary Phase 2 study for varoglutamstat conducted in the U.S. which seeks to enroll 180 patients with early AD into the Phase 2a adaptive dose finding portion and enroll a further 234 patients in the Phase 2b portion of the study. In March 2023  Vivoryon announced the study is ongoing and continuing to recruit patients at 18 sites across the U.S. The study‚Äôs independent DSMB recently provided a unanimous recommendation to continue the study without modification. The Company anticipates a decision on final trial size following the data readout of the VIVIAD study. Vivoryon expects the first cohort to be fully randomized into the study within the second quarter of this year and plans to provide the next update on the VIVA-MIND study in the second half of 2023.(NCT03919162) is a complementary Phase 2 study for varoglutamstat conducted in the U.S. which seeks to enroll 180 patients with early AD into the Phase 2a adaptive dose finding portion and enroll a further 234 patients in the Phase 2b portion of the study.Corporate Development Highlights:In May 2023  Vivoryon announced it will hold its 2023 Annual General Meeting on Wednesday  June 21  2023  at 1:00 p.m. (CEST) in Amsterdam  the Netherlands. The full agenda and all relevant documents are available on the Company‚Äôs website (https://www.vivoryon.com/annual-general-meeting-2023/) .In May 2023  Vivoryon announced intended changes among the Non-Executive members of its Board of Directors at the 2023 Annual General Meeting. Reflecting Vivoryon‚Äôs continued progress towards becoming a late-stage clinical development company and in line with its commitment to meeting international best-practice standards for corporate governance and diversity  the Company proposes the appointment of Kugan Sathiyanandarajah and Professor Morten Asser Karsdal as new members to Vivoryon‚Äôs Non-Executive Board of Directors. The proposed appointments follow the decision of the two long-standing members Dinnies Johannes von der Osten  PhD  and J√∂rg Neermann  PhD  to step down at the upcoming Annual General Meeting.Financial Results for Q1 of 2023No revenues were generated in the first quarter of 2023.Research and development expenses decreased by EUR 2.7 million to EUR 3.1 million in the three months ended March 31  2023  compared to EUR 5.8 million in the three months ended March 31  2022. This decrease was largely attributable to a reduction of EUR 1.6 million from lower manufacturing cost due to the completion of study drug supply projects with the remaining reduction due to lower clinical costs from the further progress of the Phase 2b clinical trial VIVIAD.General and administrative expenses were EUR 1.9 million in the three months ended March 31  2023  compared to EUR 0.8 million in the three months ended March 31  2022. The increase of EUR 1.1 million was largely attributable to EUR 0.8 million higher expenses for share-based payments.Net loss for the three months ended March 31  2023  was EUR 5.1 million  compared to EUR 6.4 million for the three months ended March 31  2022.The Company held EUR 17.1 million in cash and cash equivalents as of March 31  2023  compared to EUR 26.6 million as of December 31  2022. In the three months ended March 31  2023  the Company entered into a Euro term deposit of EUR 3.0 million resulting in the reallocation of the funds to financial assets from cash and cash equivalents.Financial GuidanceFollowing the capital raise settled in October 2022  according to current planning and estimates  Vivoryon expects that its existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund its research and development expenses as well the general and administrative expenses and cash flows from investing and financing activities at least through end of December 2023. This guidance does not include exercise of share options issued in October 2022  potential milestone payments from development partnerships  potential payments from licensing agreements and/or additional financing measures  as far as such payments have not yet been recognized in revenues. The financial guidance takes into account all costs to ensure sustainable study drug supply with varoglutamstat for the VIVA-MIND U.S. study.Additional information regarding other relevant information is included in the financial statements as of December 31  2022  which were part the Company‚Äôs Annual Report 2022.###About Vivoryon Therapeutics N.V.Vivoryon is a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on developing innovative small molecule-based medicines.

This compares with a net income of $68.2 million and earnings per share of $0.34 (basic) for the fourth quarter of 2022.Adjusted EBITDA of $54.7 million for the first quarter of 2023  compared with $112.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2022.Reported TCE rates for Capesize and Panamax/Ultramax vessels of $13 620 per day and $16 630 per day  respectively  and $14 929 per day for the entire fleet in the first quarter of 2023  or approximately $5 000 per day per vessel above the benchmark indices.In February 2023  entered into an agreement to acquire six modern Newcastlemax vessels  three of which have been delivered as of the date of this report. In March 2023  entered into a $233.0 million two-year credit facility to partially finance the acquisition.Entered into an agreement to sell two older Capesize vessels  Golden Feng and Golden Shui  to an unrelated third party for an aggregate net sale price of $43.6 million.Entered into a $80.0 million facility agreement to partially finance four Kamsarmax newbuildings being delivered during the second quarter of 2023.Took delivery of the first of ten Kamsarmax newbuildings under construction.Published our fifth consecutive annual Environmental  Social and Governance (ESG) report.

Shareholders holding the Company‚Äôs shares through Euronext VPS may receive this cash dividend later on or about June 8  2023.Ulrik Andersen  Chief Executive Officer  commented:‚ÄúFollowing a period of seasonal weakness in the first quarter  freight rates have rebounded  and the outlook for the rest of the year is positive  driven by the gradual recovery of the Chinese economy.We took advantage of a temporary softening in asset prices in the first quarter to acquire six modern and high-efficient vessels. Upon completion  Golden Ocean will have acquired 34 vessels in two years  bringing down the average age of the fleet to just 6.5 years and cementing our market-leading position in the large-sized segment bulkers.Over the next two years  demand is forecast to increase as fleet supply growth reaches historic lows. This dynamic will support high fleet utilization  which has historically led to strong freight rates.The Company has a proven track record of generating healthy cash flows due to our industry-leading cash breakeven levels and the fuel efficiency of our fleet. This provides a unique level of downside protection in periods of market weakness. Equally important  it supports our mission to deliver value to our shareholders through consistent dividends in the strong markets we expect in the coming years.‚ÄùThe Board of DirectorsGolden Ocean Group LimitedHamilton  BermudaMay 16  2023Questions should be directed to:Ulrik Andersen: Chief Executive Officer  Golden Ocean Management AS+47 22 01 73 40Peder Simonsen: Chief Financial Officer  Golden Ocean Management AS+47 22 01 73 40The full report is available in the link below.Forward Looking StatementsMatters discussed in this earnings report may constitute forward-looking statements.

On top of the favourable YoY comparison  the growth is due to a robust 30% organic growth  coupled with the contribution from Francesco Ventura Costruzioni Ferroviarie (‚Ç¨ 12.5 million) acquired in December 2022 and from the railway business unit of PSC Group (‚Ç¨ 8.4 million) whose acquisition has been effective starting from May 1 2022 and therefore not yet consolidated at the first quarter 2022 stage.

Consolidated EBIT reached ‚Ç¨ 22.4 million  +67.8% higher YoY despite higher D&A for ‚Ç¨ 2.1 million due to the entry into operation of new plants and machines resulting from capex made both during 2022 and in the first quarter of 2023. The Group Adjusted Net Income amounted to ‚Ç¨ 13.8 million  up 50.5% compared to the ‚Ç¨ 9.2 million of the first quarter of 2022  mainly due to the higher EBIT and despite higher adjusted financial expenses and adjusted taxes.

The Adjusted Net Financial Position as at 31 March 2023 was positive for ‚Ç¨ 35.2 million (positive for ‚Ç¨ 26.0 million at year-end 2022)  mainly as a result of the cash generation of the period  which has more than offset the cash out for the buyback plan and for the capex.

Lots of works fetched over $10 million on May 11  but none crossed the threshold of $50 million. Indeed last year's peak at the same sale when Andy Warhol's Shot Sage Blue Marilyn (1964) reached $195 million now seems quite remote.Henri Le Douanier Rousseau ‚ÄìThe Flemish (1910)  sold for $43.5 million at Christie‚Äôs on May 11  2023 (PRNewsfoto/Artmarket.com) Top 15 artists by auction turnover at Christie‚Äôs New York on May 11  2023 (PRNewsfoto/Artmarket.com)""The Art Market is a pyramid  observes thierry Ehrmann  CEO of Artmarket.com and founder of Artprice. ""Its base remains very solid  thanks to countless exchanges recorded in all four corners of the globe  in all price ranges. But each year this pyramid is usually crowned with at least one big result for a major masterpiece; a kind of apex that is missing so far this year"".The market holds its breathIt could be argued that this breaks somewhat with a tradition established by Christie's. In recent years Fran√ßois Pinault's auction house has accustomed the art market to a very major result in its New York May sales:In May 2019   Jeff Koons became the world's most expensive living artist with his sculpture Rabbit (1986) selling for $91.1 million .  became the world's most expensive living artist with his sculpture (1986) selling for . In May 2020   the sales were postponed due to the health crisis.  the sales were postponed due to the health crisis. In May 2021   Pablo Picasso's Woman seated near a window (Marie-Th√©r√®se) (1932) crossed the symbolic threshold of $100 million for the first time in two years when it fetched $103 million .  (1932) crossed the symbolic threshold of for the first time in two years when it fetched . In May 2022   Andy Warhol's   Shot sage blue Marilyn (1964)  from the Thomas Ammann Collection  fetched the second highest-ever auction result for a work of art when it was acquired by Larry Gagosian for $195 million .At its major 20th Century Art sale on May 11  2023  Christie's best result was just $43.5 million  hammered for a canvas by Henri Rousseau (aka Le Douanier) painted the year of his death. It's a resounding new auction record for this artist who was particularly fond of Picasso  but as a peak for this prestigious sale  it seems almost too modest.Does this indicate a loss of momentum after the flurry of astonishing records hammered last fall during the sale of the Paul G. Allen Collection when Christie's sold five lots above the $100 million threshold in a single evening?‚Ä¶The most spectacular results of the evening were hammered for two works from the Paul G. Allen Collection that were not included in last fall's sale. The first was Georgia O'Keeffe's Black Iris VI (1936)  estimated at $5 - 7 million and which fetched $21.1 million (including fees). When it last went to auction in 1998  it sold for $1.1 million  almost twenty times less. The other was David Hockney's early work Blossom  Woldgate (2009)  also estimated at $5 - 7 million  which climbed to $19.4 million.Guarantees‚Ä¶ but not of performanceOf the 70 lots offered by Christie's New York on May 11  2023  only 33 were not guaranteed. Increasingly common in major art sales these days  all the works in the S. I. Newhouse Collection and the Paul G. Allen Collection  (as well as many others from prestigious collections including the Alan and Dorothy Press Collection) benefited from sale guarantees.For these lots Christie's issues the following notice: ""On occasion  Christie's has a direct financial interest in the outcome of the sale of certain lots consigned for sale. This will usually be where it has guaranteed to the Seller that whatever the outcome of the auction  the Seller will receive a minimum sale price for the work. This is known as a minimum price guarantee. This is such a lot.""In the spring of 2022  30% of the lots in Christie's 20th Century Art session were subject to guarantees (17 out of the 56 offered  including two in the sale of the Anne H. Bass Collection). This year  the same auction house guaranteed 52% of the lots. However  the multiplication of such sale guarantees does not necessarily ensure a better performance.
