The achievements of the Q1 fully underpin EVS’ ambition to realize a profitable and sustainable growth in 2023.HighlightsA strong revenue for 1Q23 supporting our growth ambition for 2023.The secured revenue* calls for an upgrade of the revenue guidance for 2023 from an initial range of EUR 145-155 million to a range of EUR 150-160 million.Operational expenses are under control  demonstrating our objective to realize a profitable growth in 2023.Based on the 1Q23 results  an EBIT guidance of EUR 27 5 - 32 5 million is announced.Net cash is restoring to EUR 47 million  demonstrating our ability to collect the cash from the large volume of invoices issued at the end of 4Q22.*secured revenue includes the already recognized revenue as well as open orders on hand that will be recognized as revenue in 2023CommentsSerge Van Herck  CEO comments:“ I am thrilled to report that we have had an exceptionally strong start to the year with our Q1 results enabling us to confirm our profitable growth ambitions. We are very pleased to see our hard work paying off and our efforts to drive growth across our business are being reflected in our commercial and financial results.In addition to our strong financial performance  we also prove our ability to gain market share  while expanding our portfolio.We are also making substantial progress towards making our vision of a strong ecosystem a reality with our VIA Platform. We are moving from product sales to solution sales  which will eventually result in a robust ecosystem designed for the most demanding live production operations. This will allow us to offer more value to our customers and position us as a leading player in the industry.The strong performance of our MediaInfra solution division proves the success of the integration of Axon in 2020 and the acceleration of the EVS portfolio expansion. We are committed to pursuing strategic acquisitions that will help us drive growth and create value for our shareholders  customers and channel partners.Our sustainability efforts with our ESG program continue to deliver the expected results  and we are proud to say that we are now in the top 10% of all companies worldwide rated by Sustainalytics. We believe that sustainability is an essential part of our business strategy  and we will continue to work towards reducing our environmental impact and contributing to a better future for all.Our PlayForward strategy is helping us get EVS back into growth mode. We are focused on delivering value to our customers and building long-term relationships with them. Our ambition is to continue our growth mode both on the revenue side and profitability side  and we are confident that we are well-positioned to achieve our goals.”Commenting on the results and the outlook  Veerle De Wit  CFO  said:“The start of the new year is strong  with a record high revenue achievement for the first quarter. This result  combined with operational expenses that are well under control  enables us to realize a kick-start to the year: a year where we want to demonstrate sustainable and profitable growth.Besides a strong income statement  we are also happy to see that our cash position is restoring compared to 4Q22. Our cash position at the end of 2022 suffered from the timing of the launch of the new ERP  leading to some delays in invoicing in the last quarter of the year  and resulting in a high amount of invoices being “not due” at the end of December. As expected  I am happy to confirm that we recovered from that position in the first months of 2023.Based on the current metrics and the underlying market conditions  we are confident enough to increase our revenue guidance from EUR 145-155 million to EUR 150-160 million.Next to a revenue guidance  we are also issuing our first Earnings Before Income Tax (EBIT) guidance: based on the 1Q23 results and the market dynamics  the EBIT is expected to land between EUR 27 5 - 32 5 million. The higher end of the range clearly underlining our ambition to realize sustainable and profitable growth in 2023.”Market & customersThe main drivers of EVS in the “Premium Live Ecosystem” remain the same as in 2022 but with higher revenues  proving the success of the PlayForward approach oriented towards solutions.Based on the strong order book  revenues in NALA region continue to grow at a strong pace. While APAC and EMEA revenues were more stagnating last year for Q1  both regions are now showing very significant growth in revenue. It has to be noted that APAC revenue growth doesn’t yet consider any significant growth from China  still largerly impacted by a slow post-Covid restart.The traction for MediaInfra products division continues  especially in NALA and in EMEA. Cerebrum and Neuron platforms have now proven to be very efficient during the Big Events in 2022 and are becoming a reference in the market.Both LAB and LSP revenues are significantly increasing. LAB did show an 25%+ increase on YoY basis for Q1  based on important MediaCeption and MediaInfra contracts collected earlier. LSP revenue growth is even much higher thanks to the well engaged renewal of the replay servers  accelerated by the ever growing capabilities proposed by the new LSM-VIA replay ecosystem  exclusively available on XT-VIA server  pushing more and more customers to upgrade their older system (XT3 and XT4K).EVS continues to manage carefully the inventory of components to deliver the hardware based products according to the promise. EVS also continuously monitors inflation to reflect it progressively in the pricing and business model evolutions.TechnologiesEVS continues to materialize the Balanced Computing strategy through new solutions. At NAB  EVS announced XtraMotion 2.0 which now supports both EVS cloud deployment in SAAS and on-premise deployment. At the conference  our customers were amazed by the quality of the images and the short latency when using on-premise version  success confirmed by NAB Best of Show award in the Create category.EVS also improved the LiveCeption solution  bringing a new version of XNET-VIA which decreases the delay when accessing content stored on a distant XT-VIA from a local XT-VIA. This brings unequalled support for remote production when the infrastructure is split between two different well connected sites.On the MediaInfra side  EVS announced a new application – Neuron View high-density live production multiviewer – that can be deployed by customers on the Neuron platform. That additional application besides Bridge  Convert  Compress  Shuffle and Protect enhances the ecosystem of applications that can be virtualized on the EVS Neuron dedicated broadcast HW platform. This application is confirming the EVS sensibility and efforts in the ESG domain since it consumes up to 8 times less energy than pure SW multiviewers.IPD-VIA Create – the EVS web-based fast editing application – was another star of the EVS booth at NAB.

The achievements of the Q1 fully underpin EVS’ ambition to realize a profitable and sustainable growth in 2023.HighlightsA strong revenue for 1Q23 supporting our growth ambition for 2023.The secured revenue* calls for an upgrade of the revenue guidance for 2023 from an initial range of EUR 145-155 million to a range of EUR 150-160 million.Operational expenses are under control  demonstrating our objective to realize a profitable growth in 2023.Based on the 1Q23 results  an EBIT guidance of EUR 27 5 - 32 5 million is announced.Net cash is restoring to EUR 47 million  demonstrating our ability to collect the cash from the large volume of invoices issued at the end of 4Q22.*secured revenue includes the already recognized revenue as well as open orders on hand that will be recognized as revenue in 2023CommentsSerge Van Herck  CEO comments:“ I am thrilled to report that we have had an exceptionally strong start to the year with our Q1 results enabling us to confirm our profitable growth ambitions. We are very pleased to see our hard work paying off and our efforts to drive growth across our business are being reflected in our commercial and financial results.In addition to our strong financial performance  we also prove our ability to gain market share  while expanding our portfolio.We are also making substantial progress towards making our vision of a strong ecosystem a reality with our VIA Platform. We are moving from product sales to solution sales  which will eventually result in a robust ecosystem designed for the most demanding live production operations. This will allow us to offer more value to our customers and position us as a leading player in the industry.The strong performance of our MediaInfra solution division proves the success of the integration of Axon in 2020 and the acceleration of the EVS portfolio expansion. We are committed to pursuing strategic acquisitions that will help us drive growth and create value for our shareholders  customers and channel partners.Our sustainability efforts with our ESG program continue to deliver the expected results  and we are proud to say that we are now in the top 10% of all companies worldwide rated by Sustainalytics. We believe that sustainability is an essential part of our business strategy  and we will continue to work towards reducing our environmental impact and contributing to a better future for all.Our PlayForward strategy is helping us get EVS back into growth mode. We are focused on delivering value to our customers and building long-term relationships with them. Our ambition is to continue our growth mode both on the revenue side and profitability side  and we are confident that we are well-positioned to achieve our goals.”Commenting on the results and the outlook  Veerle De Wit  CFO  said:“The start of the new year is strong  with a record high revenue achievement for the first quarter. This result  combined with operational expenses that are well under control  enables us to realize a kick-start to the year: a year where we want to demonstrate sustainable and profitable growth.Besides a strong income statement  we are also happy to see that our cash position is restoring compared to 4Q22. Our cash position at the end of 2022 suffered from the timing of the launch of the new ERP  leading to some delays in invoicing in the last quarter of the year  and resulting in a high amount of invoices being “not due” at the end of December. As expected  I am happy to confirm that we recovered from that position in the first months of 2023.Based on the current metrics and the underlying market conditions  we are confident enough to increase our revenue guidance from EUR 145-155 million to EUR 150-160 million.Next to a revenue guidance  we are also issuing our first Earnings Before Income Tax (EBIT) guidance: based on the 1Q23 results and the market dynamics  the EBIT is expected to land between EUR 27 5 - 32 5 million. The higher end of the range clearly underlining our ambition to realize sustainable and profitable growth in 2023.”Market & customersThe main drivers of EVS in the “Premium Live Ecosystem” remain the same as in 2022 but with higher revenues  proving the success of the PlayForward approach oriented towards solutions.Based on the strong order book  revenues in NALA region continue to grow at a strong pace. While APAC and EMEA revenues were more stagnating last year for Q1  both regions are now showing very significant growth in revenue. It has to be noted that APAC revenue growth doesn’t yet consider any significant growth from China  still largerly impacted by a slow post-Covid restart.The traction for MediaInfra products division continues  especially in NALA and in EMEA. Cerebrum and Neuron platforms have now proven to be very efficient during the Big Events in 2022 and are becoming a reference in the market.Both LAB and LSP revenues are significantly increasing. LAB did show an 25%+ increase on YoY basis for Q1  based on important MediaCeption and MediaInfra contracts collected earlier. LSP revenue growth is even much higher thanks to the well engaged renewal of the replay servers  accelerated by the ever growing capabilities proposed by the new LSM-VIA replay ecosystem  exclusively available on XT-VIA server  pushing more and more customers to upgrade their older system (XT3 and XT4K).EVS continues to manage carefully the inventory of components to deliver the hardware based products according to the promise. EVS also continuously monitors inflation to reflect it progressively in the pricing and business model evolutions.TechnologiesEVS continues to materialize the Balanced Computing strategy through new solutions. At NAB  EVS announced XtraMotion 2.0 which now supports both EVS cloud deployment in SAAS and on-premise deployment. At the conference  our customers were amazed by the quality of the images and the short latency when using on-premise version  success confirmed by NAB Best of Show award in the Create category.EVS also improved the LiveCeption solution  bringing a new version of XNET-VIA which decreases the delay when accessing content stored on a distant XT-VIA from a local XT-VIA. This brings unequalled support for remote production when the infrastructure is split between two different well connected sites.On the MediaInfra side  EVS announced a new application – Neuron View high-density live production multiviewer – that can be deployed by customers on the Neuron platform. That additional application besides Bridge  Convert  Compress  Shuffle and Protect enhances the ecosystem of applications that can be virtualized on the EVS Neuron dedicated broadcast HW platform. This application is confirming the EVS sensibility and efforts in the ESG domain since it consumes up to 8 times less energy than pure SW multiviewers.IPD-VIA Create – the EVS web-based fast editing application – was another star of the EVS booth at NAB. It brings to MediaCeption solution a new very compelling application to optimize the live editing workflows and ensure editors and journalists can very quickly create videos during the event to export to social networks and other platforms or correct colours  add effects  insert a few images more on the timeline just a few seconds before the content is played live.Corporate topicsIn 2023 we will focus our corporate efforts on supporting our profitable and sustainable growth objective. We will create tools to ensure scale up and flawless operations. Next to that  we will focus on optimizing our cost structure with pro-active focus on travel expenses  trade shows  power consumption  … Finally  our attention goes to ramping up our sustainability efforts  especially when it concerns the design and energy consumption of our solutions.From a tooling point of view we want to ensure that we have efficient processes in place that promote end-to-end collaboration across all our departments. Having an efficient operational back-bone is important. In that context  EVS launched a new global ERP system in October 2022  to improve operational processes  and ensuring smooth scale up of the company. In 2023 we will expand the scope of that new global ERP system  by integrating our EVS Netherlands operations and by focussing on continuous improvements of the base. Next to the ERP we are also expanding our corporate digital footprint (CRM  Via Portal  LMS  Via Licensing  …)As the macro-economic environment is still quite volatile  it is important that we continue to focus on the profitability of our solutions. We have considerably improved our pricing models and strategy  to cope with market realities and trends. This resulted in new list prices announced in February 2023.We continue our efforts in relation to ESG. Our ESG strategy and reporting has already received postive feedback from the market: we received a silver medal from Ecovadis  obtained encouraging scores from other rating companies and recently obtained the certification of Top Employer for 2023. After having conducted our first carbon footprint analysis in 2022  we will focus in 2023 on refining our roadmap to ensure optimal adherence to sustainability goals. Also in 2023  we will focus on creating long term objectives for all the topics that are most relevant and important to us as a company.In terms of team members  2023 marks the year where we want to consolidate and leverage our growth from the past years. As such  we expect little net increase in the number of team members during the year.OutlookThe 2023 secured revenue on March 31st reaches EUR 118 2 million. Based on this measure  we are upgrading our revenue guidance for the full year from EUR 145-155 million to EUR 150-160 million.The gross margin for the full year 2023 is expected to decline marginally as a result of a change in the solution mix. The gross margin by solution is expected to evolve positively  with any impact of rising costs of components being reflected in the price increases modeled. The most recent price increase was introduced in February 2023.Operational expenses continue to be closely monitored and controlled. As our focus in 2023 is on profitable and sustainable growth  we foresee little changes in our overall headcount position.After the results of 1Q23  we also introduce an EBIT guidance for the year to be in the range of EUR 27 5 - 32 5 million.DividendWe reiterate the full year 2023 expected dividend distribution of EUR 1 10 per share  which remains subject to market conditions and to the approval of the Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders.Corporate CalendarAugust 18th  2023: H1 2023 resultsNovember 17th  2023: Q3 2023 resultsFor more information  please contact:Veerle DE WITEVS Broadcast Equipment S.A.

CONTACT-01 is a phase III clinical trial evaluating Cabometyx® (cabozantinib) in combination with atezolizumab (Tecentriq®) versus docetaxel in patients with unmutated metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who experienced disease progression on or after treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor and platinum-containing chemotherapy.Howard Mayer  M.D.  Executive Vice President  Head of Research and Development at Ipsen  said: “The results from the CONTACT-01 clinical trial have shown the challenge of treating NSCLC patients after prior lines of treatment have failed. While the findings of the study have not met the primary endpoint in this setting  we remain confident in the clinical efficacy of cabozantinib alone and in combination with another treatment in existing indications in difficult-to-treat tumor types. We wish to thank the patients  their families and healthcare teams for their participation in this clinical trial.”The safety profile of the combination of cabozantinib and atezolizumab observed in the trial was consistent with the known safety profiles for each single agent  and no new safety signals were identified. Detailed findings from CONTACT-01 will be submitted for presentation at a future medical meeting.About CONTACT-01CONTACT-01 is a global  multicenter  randomized  phase 3  open-label study that enrolled 366 patients who were randomized 1:1 to the experimental arm of cabozantinib in combination with atezolizumab and the control arm of docetaxel. The study enrolled patients with both squamous and non-squamous NSCLC who progressed during or following anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy administered either concurrently or sequentially with chemotherapy. The primary endpoint of the trial was overall survival. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival  objective response rate and duration of response. Results from cohort 7 of the phase 1b COSMIC-021 trial informed the CONTACT-01 trial design. CONTACT-01 was sponsored by Roche and co-funded by Exelixis. Both Ipsen and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (Takeda) opted in to participate in the trial and are contributing to the funding for this study under the terms of the companies’ respective collaboration agreements with Exelixis.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance.

PEDFIC 1 was a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase III trial that evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of Bylvay in reducing pruritus and serum bile acids (sBAs) in children with PFIC  and PEDFIC 2 is a long-term  open-label Phase III extension study. Patients with PFIC have impaired bile flow  or cholestasis  and the resulting bile build-up in liver cells causes liver disease and symptoms  such as intense itching  poor sleep  delayed growth  and diminished quality of life. The harmful impacts of the disease extend to parents and caregivers  as the 2022 multinational PICTURE study revealed that PFIC negatively affects caregivers’ quality of life  relationships  and career prospects.ASSERT is a gold standard  prospective intervention trial with 32 sites across North America  Europe  Middle East  and Asia Pacific. The double-blind  randomized  placebo-controlled trial was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 120 µg /kg/day Bylvay for 24 weeks in relieving pruritus in patients with ALGS. Key secondary endpoints measure serum bile acid levels and safety and tolerability. The trial enrolled patients aged 0 to 17 years of age with a genetically confirmed diagnosis of ALGS. In the primary analysis  the study met the primary endpoint showing statistically significant reduction in pruritus as measured by the PRUCISION Observer-Reported Outcome scratching score (0-4 point scale)  from baseline at month 6 (weeks 21 to 24)  compared to the placebo arm (p=0.002). Over 90% of patients were pruritus responders during the study  as defined as at least a 1-point drop at any time point. The study also met the key secondary endpoint showing a statistically significant reduction in serum bile acid concentration from baseline to the average of weeks 20 and 24 (compared to the placebo arm p=0.001). Statistically significant improvements in multiple sleep parameters were observed as early as week 1-4 compared to patients on placebo with continued improvement through week 24. In the study  there were no patient discontinuations. Bylvay was well tolerated  with an overall adverse event incidence similar to placebo and a low incidence of drug-related diarrhea (11.4% vs. 5.9% placebo).About Bylvay (odevixibat)A potent  once-daily  non-systemic ileal bile acid transport inhibitor (IBATi)  Bylvay has minimal systemic exposure and acts locally in the small intestine. It is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of pruritus in patients three months of age and older in all types of PFIC  where it has orphan exclusivity. Bylvay was first launched as a treatment option for patients with PFIC in the U.S. in 2021  where it is supported by a program designed to assist with access to treatment and patient support. Bylvay is also approved in the E.U. for the treatment of PFIC in patients aged six months or older. It has launched in over nine countries and has secured public reimbursement across several major markets including Germany  Italy  the U.K.  France and Belgium.View full E.U. prescribing information here: Bylvay  INN-odevixibat (europa.eu)View full U.S. prescribing information here: label (fda.gov)About IpsenIpsen is a global  mid-sized biopharmaceutical company focused on transformative medicines in Oncology  Rare Disease and Neuroscience.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law.

Most importantly  we are leading the industry toward positive hospitality – supporting communities and our environmental and social commitments  in full alignment with the goals of Vision 2030. Sébastien Bazin  Chairman & CEO  AccorWith a 30-year history of operating in the Kingdom  Accor ccontinues to play a key role in the development of tourism throughout Saudi Arabia  through its many existing and upcoming projects in key locations. Accor currently operates 42 properties (16 334 keys) in Saudi Arabia  with a pipeline of 56 properties (10 000+ keys) in development. The new multi-faceted projects will mix hotels with residences and local attractions  while adhering to Accor’s ethical  social  and governing principles that will contribute to a healthier environment and deliver value to its stakeholders  including guests and surrounding communities.The Rua Al Madinah project  in Madinah  includes a 142-key Fairmont hotel and 120 Fairmont branded residences  in addition to a 466-key Swissôtel and a 328-key Novotel  all set to open over the next several years. In partnership with Rua Al Madinah (RAM) Holding Company  the project will add over 1.5 million square meters of space to the Al Masjid Al Nabawi  known as the Prophet's Mosque. The new properties will be divided among 10 districts and superblocks  featuring the latest technology and smart infrastructure to ensure the operational sustainability of the project and strengthen the position of Madinah as a prestigious religious destination.Meanwhile  in the city of Riyadh  a new master planned development project will create a luxury hospitality community encompassing a 230-key Raffles hotel  a 250-key Sofitel Serviced Residence  and a 60-villa MGallery resort  all set to open by 2027. In partnership with Erth Real Estate Company  Accor will develop the multi-faceted community  which will also include office towers  residential towers  and retail & commercial space  all built around a centrally located garden area.Finally  a recently signed master development agreement with Amsa Hospitality will see the development and franchising of 18 Accor hotels in multiple cities across Saudi Arabia  such as Ha’il  Jubail  Taif  Al-Ula  Tabuk and Jazan  over the next ten years. Together  Accor and Amsa will develop a range of Accor’s economy and midscale brands  including ibis Styles  Mercure  Mercure Living  Novotel  Novotel Living and the recently launched Handwritten Collection  while also acting as the third-party operator by leasing and franchising the assets.Saudi Arabia presents a burgeoning hospitality sector which offers a host of opportunities to leverage Accor’s diverse ecosystem of hospitality brands  and we are confident the Group will double its presence in the Kingdom over the next five years. While many of our luxury and lifestyle brands are already well-known throughout the Kingdom  we look forward to establishing a larger presence with our premium  midscale  and economy brands in the country’s fast-growing  second tier cities – particularly in up-and-coming neighborhoods where we can mix hotels  restaurants  workspaces  and entertainment experiences that are as compelling to locals as they are to travelers.

EssilorLuxottica shareholders approved all 19 resolutions submitted by the Board of Directors to the Ordinary and Extraordinary General Meeting  including the compensation policy applicable to the Company’s Executive Corporate Officers.“Five years after its birth in 2018  EssilorLuxottica is now the global champion it was meant to become”  commented Francesco Milleri  Chairman and CEO  and Paul du Saillant  Deputy CEO at EssilorLuxottica after the meeting. “We realized our vision of EssilorLuxottica as an open  collaborative and omnichannel Company. Our strong and unique assets - from brands and products portfolio to distribution networks  from supply chain to innovation capability  supported by highly skilled teams - allow us to grow with the eyecare and eyewear market in a sustainable way and to deliver on our mission to help people ‘see more and be more’. We remain committed to improving consumer experience and services to eye care professionals through innovation and to enhance market standards. As we celebrate these key milestones  we would like to thank our shareholders for their continued trust and support in achieving our goals.”Option for payment of the dividend in sharesFurthermore  the resolution granting shareholders the option to receive their final dividend to be paid for the financial year ended on December 31  2022  in shares has been approved. As duly acknowledged by the Board of Directors  the price for newly issued shares for the payment of the dividend has been set at Euro 160.91 per share.This price corresponds to 90% of the average of the opening prices on Euronext Paris during the twenty trading days preceding the date of the Annual General Meeting less the amount of the final dividend to be distributed for the financial year ended on December 31  2022  this total being rounded up to the next euro cent.The ex-dividend date is set on May 22  2023. The record date is set on May 23  2023.Shareholders will be entitled to opt for payment of the dividend in newly issued shares between May 24  2023 and June 7  2023. To exercise such option  shareholders have to address their request to the authorized financial intermediaries (which may set a shorter election period depending on their administrative processes). For shareholders holding shares in pure registered form  the request will have to be addressed to the Company’s agent (Uptevia  Grands Moulins de Pantin  9  rue du Débarcadère  93761 Pantin Cedex). For shareholders who have not exercised their option by June 7  2023 (or the date set by their authorized financial intermediaries) at the latest  the final dividend will be entirely paid in cash.An application will be made to admit the new shares for trading on Euronext Paris market. The new ordinary shares allocated in payment will confer the same rights as the existing shares and carry current dividend rights (“jouissance courante”)  i.e. they will confer the right to any distribution paid out as from the date of their issuance.If the amount of the final dividend in respect of which the option will be exercised does not correspond to a whole number of shares  the shareholder will receive the number of shares rounded down to the nearest inferior whole number  and a balancing payment in cash (“soulte”).The payment of the dividend or the delivery of the new shares following the exercise of the option will take place from June 13  2023.Shareholders may connect to EssilorLuxottica.com to consult the Questions & Answers dedicated to the payment of dividend in shares.Time frameEx date 1 : May 22  2023.May 22  2023.

EssilorLuxottica shareholders approved all 19 resolutions submitted by the Board of Directors to the Ordinary and Extraordinary General Meeting  including the compensation policy applicable to the Company’s Executive Corporate Officers.“Five years after its birth in 2018  EssilorLuxottica is now the global champion it was meant to become”  commented Francesco Milleri  Chairman and CEO  and Paul du Saillant  Deputy CEO at EssilorLuxottica after the meeting. “We realized our vision of EssilorLuxottica as an open  collaborative and omnichannel Company. Our strong and unique assets - from brands and products portfolio to distribution networks  from supply chain to innovation capability  supported by highly skilled teams - allow us to grow with the eyecare and eyewear market in a sustainable way and to deliver on our mission to help people ‘see more and be more’. We remain committed to improving consumer experience and services to eye care professionals through innovation and to enhance market standards. As we celebrate these key milestones  we would like to thank our shareholders for their continued trust and support in achieving our goals.”Option for payment of the dividend in sharesFurthermore  the resolution granting shareholders the option to receive their final dividend to be paid for the financial year ended on December 31  2022  in shares has been approved. As duly acknowledged by the Board of Directors  the price for newly issued shares for the payment of the dividend has been set at Euro 160.91 per share.This price corresponds to 90% of the average of the opening prices on Euronext Paris during the twenty trading days preceding the date of the Annual General Meeting less the amount of the final dividend to be distributed for the financial year ended on December 31  2022  this total being rounded up to the next euro cent.The ex-dividend date is set on May 22  2023. The record date is set on May 23  2023.Shareholders will be entitled to opt for payment of the dividend in newly issued shares between May 24  2023 and June 7  2023. To exercise such option  shareholders have to address their request to the authorized financial intermediaries (which may set a shorter election period depending on their administrative processes). For shareholders holding shares in pure registered form  the request will have to be addressed to the Company’s agent (Uptevia  Grands Moulins de Pantin  9  rue du Débarcadère  93761 Pantin Cedex). For shareholders who have not exercised their option by June 7  2023 (or the date set by their authorized financial intermediaries) at the latest  the final dividend will be entirely paid in cash.An application will be made to admit the new shares for trading on Euronext Paris market. The new ordinary shares allocated in payment will confer the same rights as the existing shares and carry current dividend rights (“jouissance courante”)  i.e. they will confer the right to any distribution paid out as from the date of their issuance.If the amount of the final dividend in respect of which the option will be exercised does not correspond to a whole number of shares  the shareholder will receive the number of shares rounded down to the nearest inferior whole number  and a balancing payment in cash (“soulte”).The payment of the dividend or the delivery of the new shares following the exercise of the option will take place from June 13  2023.Shareholders may connect to EssilorLuxottica.com to consult the Questions & Answers dedicated to the payment of dividend in shares.Time frameEx date 1 : May 22  2023.May 22  2023.

These patients can have up to 15 liters of extra fluid in their bodies  causing major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficult breathing and restricted mobility that severely impacts daily life. Although diuretics are standard of care  the problem is that in many patients they are no longer effective and / or tolerable. There are limited effective treatment options for these patients  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing ""diuretic-resistant"" patient population.alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  delivering major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients and reducing costs for healthcare systems. The Company has reported positive primary endpoint data from the North American pivotal POSEIDON study of the alfapump in recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis  enabling the filing of a Pre-Market Approval (PMA) application with the FDA  planned for H2 2023. Having delivered clinical proof-of-concept for DSR as a disease-modifying drug program for the treatment of heart failure  the Company will commence MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical trial of DSR 2.0  with initial data expected in Q4 2023.Sequana Medical is listed on Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium.

The themes of this Panel Discussion included reviewing the ground-breaking developments in ALS drug development in the past year  the impact on people living with ALS  clinicians  drug developers and regulatory bodies  and the implications for the next generation of ALS therapeutics.The Summit highlights the implication of the entire ALS community to work together to advance the availability of new therapies for ALS sufferers.Highlights from the discussion included:Two drugs have recently been registered in ALS by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  indicating that the ALS drug development landscape is gaining some long-awaited positive momentum.In the context of ALS being an incurable and fatal degenerative disease  it is encouraging to see a certain degree of flexibility from regulatory agencies regarding registration based on a single pivotal trial and conditional approval pathways. It is hoped that such flexibility is adopted by regulatory agencies worldwide.As more drugs become available to ALS patients it will be important to assess if combined therapies offer increased benefit.On the topic of treatment combinations  Alain Moussy discussed how there should be a particular emphasis on combining drugs with different mechanisms of action. This strategy has previously proved successfully in treating cancer and HIV.Patients are requesting expanded access (or compassionate use) programs as a way to access investigational drugs under certain conditions outside of a clinical trial.ALS advocacy groups and patient support has played a critical role in facilitating drug approvals and will continue to do so.One challenge presented by the increased availability of approved therapies is the emergence of internationally dissimilar standards of care  which will complicate clinical trial design.Handling of missing data in ALS studies  especially those using the ALSFRS-R endpoint  is complex with no consensus between regulatory agencies  FDA recommending using CAFS calculation whereas EMA favors a penalty in case of discontinuation called jump to reference. Alain Moussy suggested a harmonized approach across agencies.Surrogate endpoints based on biomarkers are of interest but further research is necessary to establish correlation with meaningful functional benefit and survival.On the topic of ALS clinical endpoints  Alain Moussy suggested the development of a new clinical endpoint inspired by oncology  such as progression free survival (PFS) to facilitate registration of new drugs in a timely manner  since PFS will lead to more events that OS and so reduce the number of patients needed in a clinical study for an orphan disease.Additional information on the ALS Drug Development Summit can be found at the meeting website: https://www.als-drug-development.com/.About amyotrophic lateral sclerosisAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal motor neuron disorder that is characterized by progressive loss of the upper and lower motor neurons at the spinal or bulbar level. The disease belongs to a group of disorders known as motor neuron diseases  which are characterized by the gradual degeneration and death of motor neurons. In ALS  both the upper motor neurons and the lower motor neurons degenerate or die  and stop sending messages to muscles. The prevalence of ALS in western countries is fairly uniform at 6 per 100 000 persons  corresponding to around 30 000 cases in Europe and 20 000 in the USA. The first drug treatment for ALS  riluzole (Rilutek)  was approved in 1995. In Europe  there has been no new treatment approved since riluzole.About AB ScienceFounded in 2001  AB Science is a pharmaceutical company specializing in the research  development and commercialization of protein kinase inhibitors (PKIs)  a class of targeted proteins whose action are key in signaling pathways within cells.

Seven out of nine patients demonstrated UCART123 expansion  with maximum concentration (C max ) ranging from 13 177 to 330 530 copies/μg DNA  an almost nine-fold increase compared with FC LD  and a significant increase in area under the curve (AUC) (0-28 days) (p=0.04; FC 10.2 vs. FCA 34.9).Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) occurred in eight patients in the FC arm and nine patients in the FCA arm. In the FC arm  one patient experienced Grade 3 immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) and two patients experienced Grade 4 protocol-defined dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) secondary to CRS. In the FCA arm  two patients experienced Grade 5 DLTs secondary to CRS.Preliminary Efficacy DataEvidence of UCART123 anti-tumor activity was observed in four patients out of fifteen at DL2 or above with best overall responses in the FCA arm. Two out of eight patients (25%) at DL2 in the FCA arm achieved meaningful response:A patient who failed five prior lines of therapy experienced a durable minimal residual disease (MRD) negative complete response (CR) with full count recovery at Day 56 that continues beyond one year.A patient with stable disease achieved greater than 90% bone marrow blast reduction (60% to 5%) at Day 28.The preliminary data show that adding alemtuzumab to the FC LD regimen was associated with sustained lymphodepletion and significantly higher UCART123 cell expansion  which correlated with improved anti-tumor activity.Patient Enrollment in a 2-Dose Regimen ArmOverall  these preliminary data support the continued administration of UCART123 after FCA lymphodepletion in patients with r/r AML. Based on observed UCART123 expansion patterns and cytokine profiles  pursuant to an amended protocol  a second dose of UCART123 is given after 10-14 days to allow for additional UCART123 expansion and clinical activity without the use of additional lymphodepletion. The UCART123 cell expansion from the second dose of UCART123  in the setting of reduced disease burden  is expected to be safe and allow for clearance of residual disease.“These clinically meaningful preliminary data from the AMELI-01 study are very encouraging for patients and for the future of allogeneic CART-cell therapy. AML is a disease with an urgent need for alternative treatment options for patients  and we are excited to be moving the study forward ” said Dr. Mark Frattini  M.D.  Ph.D.  Chief Medical Officer at Cellectis. “We have now implemented a two-dose regimen arm for our AMELI-01 trial and we look forward to sharing future updates as they become available.”Title: AMELI-01: A Phase I Trial of UCART123v1.2  an Anti-CD123 Allogeneic CAR-T Cell Product  in Adult Patients with Relapsed or Refractory (R/R) CD123+ Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)Presenter: Daniel Lee  M.D.  Director  Clinical Sciences at CellectisSession Date/Time: 5/17/2023 - 3:45 PM – 5:30PM PDTSession Title: CAR Engineering and Production Advances for Targeting Hematologic and Solid Tumor MalignanciesSession Room: 502 ABFinal Abstract Number: 94A copy of the ASGCT oral presentation will be available on Cellectis’ website after the presentation: https://www.cellectis.com/en/investors/scientific-presentations/Poster Presentation:Expanding the scope of multiplex engineering for superior generation of efficient CAR T-cellsIn recent years  advances in genomic-based cellular engineering are bringing us a step closer to conquering solid tumors. This glimpse of success also demonstrated that we need to be able to creatively customize and equip CAR T-cells to target these tumors.In this presentation  Cellectis shows that we can use the state-of-the-art TALEN® technology to precisely edit up to four loci simultaneously while delivering several additional payloads to increase the efficacy and persistence of CAR T-cells.The preclinical data demonstrate that multiplexed engineering does not compromise CAR T-cell function  which can even be enhanced and display improved anti-tumor activity. Thus  multiplexed engineering at superior efficiency rates while preserving genomic integrity has the potential to generate highly functional CAR T-cells to advance in the fight against solid tumors.Cellectis takes it a step further and uses a curated combination of genome engineering technologies including TALE base editors (TALE-BE) to increase the efficiency of multiplexed gene editing while protecting genomic integrity.“The immunosuppressive barriers of the tumor microenvironment antagonize CAR T-cells and have limited our ability to target solid tumors. These preclinical data show that we can precisely select and combine an array of gene and cell engineering approaches to produce armored CAR T-cells with high efficiency rates. With this strategy  we can focus on unmeet clinical needs and equip CAR T-cells with enhanced activity to help us in our quest to defeat solid tumors ” said Beatriz Aranda Orgilles  Ph.D.  Team Leader at Cellectis.The poster presentation at ASGCT highlights the following preclinical data:Optimization of delivery timings and selection of compatible TALEN ® pairs provides high editing efficiency while attenuating potential TALEN ® crosstalk.pairs provides high editing efficiency while attenuating potential TALEN crosstalk. TALEN ® and TALE-BE technologies can be integrated in the generation of CAR T-cells to provide high gene editing rates while preserving genomic safety.and TALE-BE technologies can be integrated in the generation of CAR T-cells to provide high gene editing rates while preserving genomic safety. CAR T-cells can be engineered to carry multiple edits and simultaneously exhibit several key features to combat solid tumors: immuno-evasive properties  secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-12  resistance to the immunosuppressive pathways PD-1 and TGFB1.Multi-equipped CAR T-cells can efficiently target in vivo and in vitro models of triple negative breast cancer  an aggressive tumor that to date has limited therapeutic possibilities.Title: Expanding the Scope of Multiplex Engineering for Superior Generation of Efficient CAR T-cellsPresenter: Beatriz Aranda Orgilles  Ph.D.  Team Leader at CellectisSession Date/Time: 5/17/2023 12:00 PM PDTSession Title: Wednesday Poster SessionPoster Board Number: 604Final Abstract Number: 604Poster of the presentation will be available on Cellectis’ website after the presentation: https://www.cellectis.com/en/investors/scientific-presentations/About CellectisCellectis is a clinical-stage biotechnology company using its pioneering gene-editing platform to develop life-saving cell and gene therapies.

(Euronext Brussels  Athens Stock Exchange: CENER)  hereafter ""Cenergy Holdings"" or ""the Company""  announces today its consolidated financial information for the first quarter of 2023.Record high first quarter results with strong full year financial outlookRevenue for Q1 2023 reaches EUR 381 million (27% growth y-o-y).for Q1 2023 reaches (27% growth y-o-y). Operational profitability for Q1 hits record-high levels with adjusted EBITDA at EUR 44 million   95% higher year-on-year  pushed by the strong performance of both segments; consolidated net profit after tax at EUR 15.4 million versus EUR 6 million in Q1 2022 (+59%).for Q1 hits record-high levels with adjusted EBITDA at   95% higher year-on-year  pushed by the strong performance of both segments; consolidated at versus EUR 6 million in Q1 2022 (+59%). Following significant recent project awards  the order backlog [1] reached EUR 2.27 billion as of 31 March 2023 from EUR 2 billion three months earlierreached as of 31 March 2023 from EUR 2 billion three months earlier The expansion plan in Corinth submarine cables plant is on track ; financing was secured through a EUR 88 million loan  under EBRD's Greek RRF co-Financing Framework.; financing was secured through a EUR 88 million loan  under EBRD's Greek RRF co-Financing Framework. Adjusted EBITDA for FY2023 expected in the range of EUR 180 - 200 million.Commenting on the Group's performance for the first-quarter of 2023  Alexis Alexiou  Cenergy Holdings' Chief Executive Officer  said:""Full production schedules across all plants and several new project awards marked an excellent start of the year and allowed us to record the best ever first quarter period. Our order backlog stabilized over the EUR 2 billion threshold with the growing demand for electrification remaining the key driver of the Group's growth. The necessary expansion in the offshore cables capacity is fully supported by a strong financing partner such as EBRD. At the same time  the visibility provided by orders already secured allows the Group to expect an operational profitability target for FY 2023  in terms of adjusted EBITDA  in the range of EUR 180 - 200 million"".[1]Backlog includes signed contracts  as well as contracts not yet enforced  for which the subsidiaries have either received a letter of award or been declared preferred bidder by the tenderers.Outstanding operational performance in both segmentsRevenue grew by 27% on a yearly basis and reached EUR 381 million. This increase was mainly due to the steel pipes segment  currently executing energy projects from orders secured during 2022. Demand for cables products remained strong and margins improved  while the cables projects business continued to deliver a strong foundation for the segment's profitability.Adjusted EBITDA rose to EUR 44.0 million (+95% y-o-y) as both segments improved margins  keeping their focus on high value-added products  which in turn led to a more favourable sales mix. The Group's a-EBITDA margin reached a double-digit figure (11.5%)  significantly higher than the margin achieved in Q1 2022. The successful execution of energy projects remains the main driver of such profitability  as it provides a steady basis in a challenging global macroeconomic environment.The key projects executed in the reporting period were:Cables: The turnkey interconnection projects of Lavrio - Serifos / Serifos - Milos interconnection (phase 4 of the Cyclades' interconnection in Greece  with a total cable length of 170 km) and Zakynthos - Kilini interconnection progressed significantly  while the final batches of 66kV inter-array cables for phase B of the Doggerbank offshore wind farm in the UK were produced.The turnkey interconnection projects of Lavrio - Serifos / Serifos - Milos interconnection (phase 4 of the Cyclades' interconnection in Greece  with a total cable length of 170 km) and Zakynthos - Kilini interconnection progressed significantly  while the final batches of 66kV inter-array cables for phase B of the Doggerbank offshore wind farm in the UK were produced. Steel pipes: The West Macedonia pipeline project for DESFA (163km) and the Alexandroupolis FSRU project for Saipem (28km) were initiated during the year  while the production for Fenix offshore gas field in Argentina awarded by TotalEnergies continued and is expected to be completed by the end of the year.Increased activity along with the timing of payment milestones for ongoing projects keep working capital needs and consequently  net debt  at high levels. In addition to higher interest rates driven by an increased EURIBOR caused net finance costs to attain significantly higher levels  at EUR 16.2 million vs. EUR 6.8 million during the corresponding quarter of last year.Despite such higher costs  profit before income tax increased more than 50% year-on-year and reached EUR 18.5 million (EUR 12.3 million in Q1 2022). Profit after tax followed suit at EUR 15.4 million (EUR 9.6 million in Q1 2022)  representing 4.0% of revenue (vs. 3.2% last year).Finally  during Q1 2023  a capital expenditure plan in the cables segment of ca. EUR 80 million over two-years was announced; this prepares the segment for the ever-growing demand for electrification caused by the accelerating transition to a low-carbon economy. The plan includes a major expansion of the sophisticated subsea cable plant in Corinth  Greece that will double production capacity of submarine cables  provide additional storage as well as extensively upgrade the plant's port facilities.In this context  the segment combined the Greek Recovery and Resilience Fund (RRF) co-Financing Framework with a loan facility by the EBRD. EUR 88 million  made up from EUR 25.2 million as an RRF loan channelled through the Greek Ministry of Finance  and the remaining EUR 62.8 million from the EBRD  will finance a wider investment program of EUR 110 million that includes the abovementioned Corinth plant's expansion along with the associated working capital outlays once the new production capacity is available  as well as research & development (R&D) initiatives to be undertaken in the following years. The remaining EUR 22 million will be covered by own funds.Order backlog rose to EUR 2.27 billionHellenic Cables and Corinth Pipeworks continued their successes in tendering  keeping total backlog at levels above EUR 2 billion. Projects awarded during the first quarter include:260 km of 66 kV XLPE-insulated subsea inter-array cables and associated accessories for South Fork Wind and Revolution Wind in the Northeast U.S. the supply of approx. 155km of 20"" longitudinally submerged arc welded steel pipes for the Tamar gas field optimization development  in the South-eastern Mediterranean the supply and installation of 400 kV and 150 kV underground cable systems in the context of two turnkey projects in Greece for ADMIE - IPTO the supply of 16km of 20"" diameter High Frequency Welded (HFW) steel pipes for the N05-A platform in the North Sea the supply of approx. 30 Km of 110 kV High Voltage submarine cables  accessories  and related services as part of a project by the Croatian Transmission System Operator (HOPS) to replace outdated cable lines in the Adriatic Sea.OutlookThe cables segment expects to retain both an improved product mix and comfortable margins in the products business unit  along with a set of secured orders for the projects business unit. The latter and high-capacity utilisation in all plants throughout the year will foster profitability for the entire segment for 2023. At the same time  the electrification momentum in Europe and the increasing demand of grid connections are expected to further fuel the order book of the segment. Following previous announcements  the discussions with Ørsted on the partnership for the construction of a submarine inter array cables factory in Maryland  USA are continuing.The steel pipes segment expects the gas fuel sector to continue its dynamic growth  in line with the energy transition pillars. The quest for energy security along with currently high energy prices  press for the exploitation of new and existing gas reserves and drive the demand for new interconnectors  while new pipelines that are ready for the new hydrogen era and Carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects are gathering up pace. As market conditions improve  so is the order backlog  feeding into a positive outlook for the 2023.Given the strong order backlog for both segments and the growing demand for energy infrastructure products worldwide  Cenergy Holdings expects an adjusted EBITDA in the range of EUR 180 - 200 million for the FY 2023. The financial outlook is subject to several assumptions including (a) smooth execution of energy projects in both segments  (b) a strong demand for cables products and (c) limited financial impact from an uncertain global geopolitical and macroeconomic environment  high inflationary pressures and/or supply-chain challenges and/or potential disruptions.DISCLAIMER: Any forward-looking statements that may be included in this press release are statements regarding or based on current expectations  plans or understandings of our management relating to  inter alia  Cenergy Holdings' future results of operations  financial position  liquidity  prospects  growth  strategies or developments in the markets in which its subsidiaries operate.

PEDFIC 1 was a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase III trial that evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of Bylvay in reducing pruritus and serum bile acids (sBAs) in children with PFIC  and PEDFIC 2 is a long-term  open-label Phase III extension study. Patients with PFIC have impaired bile flow  or cholestasis  and the resulting bile build-up in liver cells causes liver disease and symptoms  such as intense itching  poor sleep  delayed growth  and diminished quality of life. The harmful impacts of the disease extend to parents and caregivers  as the 2022 multinational PICTURE study revealed that PFIC negatively affects caregivers’ quality of life  relationships  and career prospects.ASSERT is a gold standard  prospective intervention trial with 32 sites across North America  Europe  Middle East  and Asia Pacific. The double-blind  randomized  placebo-controlled trial was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 120 µg /kg/day Bylvay for 24 weeks in relieving pruritus in patients with ALGS. Key secondary endpoints measure serum bile acid levels and safety and tolerability. The trial enrolled patients aged 0 to 17 years of age with a genetically confirmed diagnosis of ALGS. In the primary analysis  the study met the primary endpoint showing statistically significant reduction in pruritus as measured by the PRUCISION Observer-Reported Outcome scratching score (0-4 point scale)  from baseline at month 6 (weeks 21 to 24)  compared to the placebo arm (p=0.002). Over 90% of patients were pruritus responders during the study  as defined as at least a 1-point drop at any time point. The study also met the key secondary endpoint showing a statistically significant reduction in serum bile acid concentration from baseline to the average of weeks 20 and 24 (compared to the placebo arm p=0.001). Statistically significant improvements in multiple sleep parameters were observed as early as week 1-4 compared to patients on placebo with continued improvement through week 24. In the study  there were no patient discontinuations. Bylvay was well tolerated  with an overall adverse event incidence similar to placebo and a low incidence of drug-related diarrhea (11.4% vs. 5.9% placebo).About Bylvay (odevixibat)A potent  once-daily  non-systemic ileal bile acid transport inhibitor (IBATi)  Bylvay has minimal systemic exposure and acts locally in the small intestine. It is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of pruritus in patients three months of age and older in all types of PFIC  where it has orphan exclusivity. Bylvay was first launched as a treatment option for patients with PFIC in the U.S. in 2021  where it is supported by a program designed to assist with access to treatment and patient support. Bylvay is also approved in the E.U. for the treatment of PFIC in patients aged six months or older. It has launched in over nine countries and has secured public reimbursement across several major markets including Germany  Italy  the U.K.  France and Belgium.View full E.U. prescribing information here: Bylvay  INN-odevixibat (europa.eu)View full U.S. prescribing information here: label (fda.gov)About IpsenIpsen is a global  mid-sized biopharmaceutical company focused on transformative medicines in Oncology  Rare Disease and Neuroscience.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law. Ipsen’s business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers.

With an initial focus on five projects in various locations worldwide  the companies will jointly offer a range of end-to-end solutions to help clients and customers expedite progress toward their carbon-reduction goals.For Arcadis and Honeywell  this relationship strengthens the efforts that both organizations are making to help clients that are committed to improving outcomes related to ESG. The relationship is not exclusive  and both companies expect to add additional collaborations to enhance their offerings in this space.Data from the World Economic Forum suggests that approximately 80% of today's buildings will still be standing in 2050i – which means the challenge of controlling escalating energy use  particularly in older buildings  to meet carbon-reduction targets will increase over the coming decades. Many building owners and operators lack the expertise and technology to monitor and optimize energy performance  making it harder for them to initiate change in their organizations. Honeywell and Arcadis offer unique but complementary services to address these shortfalls and will work with clients and customers to map a path toward lower carbon emissions  while also improving resilience.For building owners who have already set goals and made pledges to reduce carbon footprint across their portfolio  the collaboration will deploy a software suite that applies milestones to document progress with tailored insights and data-led reports that showcase these efforts to internal and external stakeholders. Honeywell and Arcadis will also formulate strategic goals for organizations that do not have access to asset- or device-level energy performance data.Arcadis brings a deep background in evaluating business impacts across programs and portfolios. It assesses ESG risks for companies by developing current-state assessments that analyze technical and financial scenarios to measure impacts across energy and climate  materials and waste  and buildings and infrastructure. Arcadis also helps building owners include other ESG goals in the design of their real estate assets  such as climate adaptation  biodiversity  and inclusivity.""The strength of Arcadis is our ability to help clients identify where change can have the most impact in their organization when it comes to their energy use and carbon footprint "" said Alan Brookes  chief executive officer  Arcadis. ""By working with Honeywell  we can take that insight and provide an end-to-end service from planning to execution and ongoing maintenance to allow clients to reduce the energy use within their building portfolios and demonstrate the value of their investment to key stakeholders.""Honeywell brings decades of experience in developing smart-building technologies that utilize artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML)-enabled software to enhance control systems with sensor-driven analytics  occupancy tracking and predictive maintenance. The company also offers service solutions that help building owners fund improvements as operating expenses instead of capital investments.""By combining our ready-now advanced building controls software with Arcadis' expertise in sustainability assessments and roadmapping  we can develop plans for customers that meet both their short-term need to manage energy use and their long-term aspiration to reduce their carbon footprint "" said Billal Hammoud  president and chief executive officer  Honeywell Building Technologies. ""By drawing on our respective strengths  we can deliver more efficient and effective sustainability solutions for buildings.""Documenting and reporting sustainability efforts will only increase in importance as more and more regulatory actions are enacted. The Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)  for example  requires all large and listed companies to disclose information on risks and opportunities related to ESG issues and their impact on the environment.ii Through collaborations such as this one  Arcadis and Honeywell are creating an ecosystem of third-party solutions and complementary services to help clients and customers worldwide reduce their energy consumption and carbon emissions.FOR FURTHER INFORMATION PLEASE CONTACT:ARCADIS CORPORATE COMMUNICATIONSKerri MooreMobile: +44 7821 836890E-mail: kerri.moore@arcadis.comARCADIS INVESTOR RELATIONSChristine DischMobile: +31 6 15376020E-mail: christine.disch@arcadis.comHONEYWELLDawn WotapkaMobile: +1 631 943 3782Email: Dawn.Wotapka@Honeywell.comABOUT ARCADISArcadis is the leading global design & consultancy organization for natural and built assets.

Q1 138.2 114.4 +20.8% o/w Automotive Division 119.0 101.3 +17.5% o/w Telecoms Division 19.1 13.1 +45.6%* Unaudited data.At €138.2 million in the first quarter of 2023  ACTIA Group turnover rose by 20.8%  a reflection of the Group's healthy order book. Still suffering from the supply difficulties now mainly affecting a few families of components  ACTIA has not yet been able to return to normal production conditions. However  the experience acquired in recent years has made it possible to limit the effects on its customers  notwithstanding that demand has not always been completely satisfied. With a more even spread of business activity over the period than in 2022  thereby creating a favourable basis for comparison for this quarter  the turnover of the Telecoms business  at €19.1 million  grew by 45.6% compared to the same period in 2022.For the first quarter of 2023  the sales of the foreign subsidiaries amounted to €82.3 million  an improvement of 28.4%  while those of the French companies reached €68.2 million  up by 13.9%. The progress made with the Group's French customers  especially in the areas of Rail and Energy  automatically meant a lower share for the international business. So  63.6% of turnover was generated by foreign customers  compared to 66.9% for the first quarter of 2022. Compared to the previous year  only the Asia region declined (by 13.6%)  with China continuing to benefit in the first quarter of 2022 from the favourable impact of the Volvo Car contract that it has partially offset through the development of our local subsidiary  which grew by 15.0%.The Automotive Division contributed 86.1% of the Group's quarterly sales. The OEM business  which represented 74.1% of the division's sales and grew by 17.8%  reflected the dynamism of the contracts that replaced the Volvo Car telematics contract  particularly in the areas of Rail  up by 89.4%  Off-Highway  up by 59.3% and Trucks  up by 24.5%. Business with the car manufacturers quite naturally declined by 21.5%. The Aftermarket business  at 6.0% of the division's sales  declined by 43.7% due to the basis of comparison still including the Technical Inspection and Garage Equipment businesses  sold in April 2022. The marked drop of 38.4% in the area of fleet management for the Buses & Coaches business was a sign of the difficulties being experienced by public and private sector investors in this segment. The Manufacturing Design & Services (MDS) electronics outsourcing business  at 15.4% of the division's sales  grew by 35.1%  driven by the recovery of the aeronautics sector. Lastly  ""Other""  with the ramping up of the studies sold as part of the R&D outsourcing business  now represents 4.5% of the division's sales.The Telecoms Division represented 13.8% of the Group's quarterly sales. The significant improvement of 45.6%  related to the ramping up of solutions for the Energy and Rail markets with increases of respectively 57.8% and 151.4%  reflects the relevance of the strategic options taken over recent years. However  the continuation of this robust trend will depend to a large extent on reliable supplies of components for these two sectors.2023 OUTLOOKAlthough not able at this stage to envisage a significant improvement in the supply situation by the end of the year  ACTIA maintains its growth objective at more than 15%. Based on the solidity of its order book and its ever-stronger portfolio of multi-year contracts  ACTIA Group has a revenue target in excess of €800 million by 2025. This growth will be accompanied by a new segmentation of the Group's businesses into 4 Divisions (Mobility  Energy  Aerospace  Engineering) in order to provide greater transparency and visibility  as well as further potential for growth. These changes will be made over the next three years.ORDINARY GENERAL MEETINGThe Ordinary General Meeting will be convened on 23 May 2023 at 5 pm.

The second Pharmacy Next: Consumer Care and Cost Trends survey data also show generational trends that suggest this shift in the healthcare ecosystem is permanent and will change how all stakeholders approach care delivery in the coming years.“As we saw in last year’s survey  primary care decentralization is continuing – the traditional one doctor-one patient  single point of coordination is vanishing  and this is especially evident in younger generations ” said Peter Bonis  MD  Chief Medical Officer  Wolters Kluwer Health. “By preparing for this shift today  providers can work in concert across care sites to deliver the best care to patients. Likewise  newer care delivery models  like retail pharmacies and clinics  can ensure they’re ready to meet the expectations of healthcare consumers  who will increasingly be turning to them for a growing range of care needs.”Care is rapidly decentralizing  and Gen Z and Millennial consumers are leading the wayPharmacies are becoming a front-line site for non-emergency care  particularly among younger generations. This shift is still confined mostly to retail pharmacy  versus emerging care sites such as health clinics in department stores  such as Walmart or Target  with 80% of consumers saying they would probably never go to a department store for healthcare. The survey also found consumers will go to different care sites depending on the services they need.Key data findings include:First stop  the pharmacy : 58% of Americans are likely to visit a local pharmacy as a first step when faced with a non-emergency medical issue. 81% say they trust a pharmacist  nurse  or nurse practitioner to diagnose minor illnesses and prescribe medications to treat them.: 58% of Americans are likely to visit a local pharmacy as a first step when faced with a non-emergency medical issue. 81% say they trust a pharmacist  nurse  or nurse practitioner to diagnose minor illnesses and prescribe medications to treat them. Generational divide : More than half of Gen Z and Millennials (56% and 54%) have visited a local pharmacy to receive care in the past year  compared to 40% of Gen X and 35% of Boomers.: More than half of Gen Z and Millennials (56% and 54%) have visited a local pharmacy to receive care in the past year  compared to 40% of Gen X and 35% of Boomers. Department store trust deficit : 79% of Americans trust their local pharmacy to provide care more than clinic staff at department stores.: 79% of Americans trust their local pharmacy to provide care more than clinic staff at department stores. Vaccination variations: 54% of Americans would go to a traditional physician’s office only for vaccinations for children  but for flu shots and other vaccinations for adults  over three in five (62%) would go to a local pharmacy.Consumer trust juggles convenience  credentials  and health record access assumptionsAs consumers entrust care to alternative settings  some are less likely to focus on provider qualifications and many assume pharmacists are already familiar with their medical history. Given that the sharing of patient health records between care sites is still not standardized or coordinated  this assumption comes with risk – consumers must play a more active role in sharing their histories. Convenience is also important  and in non-emergency situations  this can trump concerns around medical qualifications  especially for younger consumers.Records check? 67% believe pharmacists check medical records and/or information about a patient before filling a prescription more than half the time.67% believe pharmacists check medical records and/or information about a patient before filling a prescription more than half the time. Convenience vs credentials: When asked what’s most important in a non-emergency situation  one in three Americans (33%) said convenience over the credentials and/or qualifications of the person providing their care. Less than one quarter (23%) of Boomers agreed.Prescription prices and availability still weigh heavily on consumersThe overall cost of healthcare is increasing  both for medications and care interactions. The survey findings show that consumers are still struggling to keep up with prescription prices  which  in many cases  is causing them to skip their medications. They are looking to their pharmacists and clinicians to advise them on lower cost options. As an alternative  consumers are cautiously eyeing new options for receiving medications  but concerns about using these options still exist.Too “Rx-pensive”? 37% of Americans chose not to fill a prescription because of cost.37% of Americans chose not to fill a prescription because of cost. Over-the-counter advantages: More than three-quarters (76%) say many widely used safer prescription drugs should be made available over the counter (OTC). 74% say this would help lower costs without compromising safety.More than three-quarters (76%) say many widely used safer prescription drugs should be made available over the counter (OTC). 74% say this would help lower costs without compromising safety. Conversations about costs: 86% would receive generic medications if it meant saving money  and 92% feel their physician and their pharmacist should inform them of these alternatives. In the past few months  over one-third (36%) have talked with their pharmacist about affording their medications or if other options are available.86% would receive generic medications if it meant saving money  and 92% feel their physician and their pharmacist should inform them of these alternatives.

Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium  May …,INSIDE INFORMATIONBioSenic plans to further develop its program on an active injectable viscosupplement JTA  combining anti-pain and anti-inflammatory characteristics on a subtype of knee osteoarthritis.Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium  May 17th  2023 7.00am CET – BioSenic (Euronext Brussels and Paris: BIOS)  the clinical stage company specializing in serious autoimmune and inflammatory diseases and cell repair  today announces an update to its future plans for clinical development of BioSenic’s enhanced viscosupplement JTA. This includes BioSenic reacquiring intellectual property rights for the therapy.BioSenic announced in March 2023 that it had it has re-evaluated the results of its Phase III trial of its enhanced viscosupplement JTA-004 targeting knee osteoarthritis (OA). The original results from this trial were released on August 2021. The multicenter  randomized  double blind  placebo- and active-controlled Phase III study was conducted in 7 European countries and Hong Kong and included a total of 743 patients. The study did not meet the primary and consequently the key secondary endpoints  despite JTA’s favorable safety profile.In March 2022  a peer-reviewed paper formally identified three subtypes of OA  including one subtype of patients with more severe symptoms and inflammation. The recent post-hoc analysis conducted by BioSenic revealed that there were critical clinical confounding factors explaining the lack of discrimination among the general population of patients recruited for knee osteoarthritis (KOA): first  a placebo treatment with possible positive effects and second  the lack of stratification between patient subtypes. This allowed BioSenic to review all the data from the Phase III JTA-004 trial in early 2023. BioSenic used a statistical analysis specialist to study the results of the Phase III JTA-004 trial  particularly in the subset of patients with the most painful and inflammatory form of OA  representing about one third of the total patients. The post-hoc results showed a pain-relieving effect of a single injection of JTA-004 a composition of three elements (hyaluronic acid  plasma proteins and clonidine). This benefit is not only superior to placebo but also to the active comparator.This new in-depth analysis now enables BioSenic to recall the intellectual property rights to JTA  which were transferred to the Walloon Region in Belgium  with the reset of the initial financial agreement between both parties. BioSenic is already looking for an industry partner to submit its results to the regulatory bodies in order to find the best and fastest way to obtain a Marketing Authorization (MA). This partnership will jointly conduct a small-scale additional Phase III trial targeting the most severe form of knee OA  prior to the MA with global regulators. The Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) could be submitted as soon as three years after the start of the Phase III trial  and as a result JTA could reach the market in 2027.“As a result of significant advances in medical knowledge of knee osteoarthritis  BioSenic is now able to stratify previous clinical results and identify a specific subtype of the disease that can clearly benefit from the administration of a single injection of JTA. It has also been identified that the benefits of JTA to the subset of patients involves greater benefit than currently available therapies on the market  including Synvisc one  made of hyaluronic acid ” said Prof. François Rieger  PhD  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of BioSenic. “As a result  BioSenic will be looking to make JTA available to the patients heavily affected by severe KOA as quickly as possible. This is going to be one of the additional new projects of BioSenic  bringing a strong diversification and new perspectives for BioSenic’s pipeline of clinical indications.”About BioSenicBioSenic is a leading biotech company specializing in the development of clinical assets issued from: (i)  the allogeneic cell therapy platform ALLOB and (ii) the Arsenic TriOxide (ATO) platform. Key target indications for the platforms include Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD)  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) and high-risk tibial fractures.Following the merger in October 2022  BioSenic combines the strategic positionings and strengths of Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics. The merger also enables Biosenic to add to its innovative cell therapy platform and strong IP for tissue repair protection with an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/OATO.BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About BioSenic technology platformsBioSenic’s technology is based on two main platforms:1) The allogeneic cell and gene therapy platform  developed by BioSenic with differentiated bone marrow sourced Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) that can be stored at the point of use in hospitals. Its current investigational medicinal product  ALLOB  represents a unique  proprietary approach to organ repair and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells on the site of injury after a single local injection. These cells are produced via a BioSenic's scalable manufacturing process. Following the CTA approval by regulatory authorities in Europe  BioSenic has initiated patient recruitment for the Phase IIb clinical trial with ALLOB in patients with difficult tibial fractures  using its optimized production process. ALLOB is currently being evaluated in a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase IIb study in patients with high-risk tibial fractures  using its optimized production process  after a successful first safety and efficacy study (Phase 1/2a) on fractured long bones  with late delayed union. The patient recruitment has been halted late February 2023 with 57 patients and the new rules permitted for statistical analysis should allow BioSenic to get the main results of this trial much earlier than anticipated in the original protocol  since they are expected by mid-2023.2) The Arsenic TriOxide (ATO) platform developed by Medsenic. The immunomodulatory properties of ATO have demonstrated a double basic effect on cells of the immune system. The first effect is the increase of the cell oxidative stress in activated B  T or other cells of the innate/adaptative immune system to the point they will enter a cell death program (apoptosis) and be eliminated. The second effect is potent immunomodulatory properties on several pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in inflammatory or autoimmune cell pathways. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. GvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). GvHD is primarily mediated by the transplanted immune system that can lead to severe multiorgan damage. Medsenic had been successful in a Phase II trial with its intravenous formulation  allowing arsenic trioxide to be granted an orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA and is heading towards an international Phase III confirmatory study  with a new  IP protected  oral (OATO) formulation. Moderate to Severe forms of Systemic Lupus erythematosus (SLE) is another selected target  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastro-intestinal tract) in a Phase IIa study.Systemic Sclerosis is  in addition  part of the clinical pipeline of BioSenic. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive. This gives good grounds to launch a Phase II clinical protocol for this serious disease that badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and with no actual current effective treatment.In addition  BioSenic is developing an off-the-shelf next-generation improved viscosupplement  JTA-004  consisting of a unique combination of plasma proteins  hyaluronic acid - a natural component of knee synovial fluid  and a fast-acting analgesic. JTA-004 intends to provide added lubrication and protection to the cartilage of the arthritic joint and to alleviate osteoarthritic pain (OA) and inflammation. In March 2023  after the identification of new OA subtypes  BioSenic delivered a new post-hoc analysis of its Phase III JTA-004 trial on knee OA with positive action on the most severely affected patient population. This new post-hoc analysis changes the therapeutic profile of the molecule and potentially allows for the possibility of stratifying patients for a new  optimized Phase III clinical study. BioSenic  which does not intend to allocate R&D resources to support the clinical development of JTA-004 and will continue to focus its R&D activities on the development of its autoimmune (ATO) and cell therapy (ALLOB) platforms  is now seeking to collaborate with existing and potential partners to explore options for the future development of JTA-004 based on this new post-hoc analysis.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAPr.

This includes BioSenic reacquiring intellectual property rights for the therapy.BioSenic announced in March 2023 that it had it has re-evaluated the results of its Phase III trial of its enhanced viscosupplement JTA-004 targeting knee osteoarthritis (OA). The original results from this trial were released on August 2021. The multicenter  randomized  double blind  placebo- and active-controlled Phase III study was conducted in 7 European countries and Hong Kong and included a total of 743 patients. The study did not meet the primary and consequently the key secondary endpoints  despite JTA’s favorable safety profile.In March 2022  a peer-reviewed paper formally identified three subtypes of OA  including one subtype of patients with more severe symptoms and inflammation. The recent post-hoc analysis conducted by BioSenic revealed that there were critical clinical confounding factors explaining the lack of discrimination among the general population of patients recruited for knee osteoarthritis (KOA): first  a placebo treatment with possible positive effects and second  the lack of stratification between patient subtypes. This allowed BioSenic to review all the data from the Phase III JTA-004 trial in early 2023. BioSenic used a statistical analysis specialist to study the results of the Phase III JTA-004 trial  particularly in the subset of patients with the most painful and inflammatory form of OA  representing about one third of the total patients. The post-hoc results showed a pain-relieving effect of a single injection of JTA-004 a composition of three elements (hyaluronic acid  plasma proteins and clonidine). This benefit is not only superior to placebo but also to the active comparator.This new in-depth analysis now enables BioSenic to recall the intellectual property rights to JTA  which were transferred to the Walloon Region in Belgium  with the reset of the initial financial agreement between both parties. BioSenic is already looking for an industry partner to submit its results to the regulatory bodies in order to find the best and fastest way to obtain a Marketing Authorization (MA). This partnership will jointly conduct a small-scale additional Phase III trial targeting the most severe form of knee OA  prior to the MA with global regulators. The Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) could be submitted as soon as three years after the start of the Phase III trial  and as a result JTA could reach the market in 2027.“As a result of significant advances in medical knowledge of knee osteoarthritis  BioSenic is now able to stratify previous clinical results and identify a specific subtype of the disease that can clearly benefit from the administration of a single injection of JTA. It has also been identified that the benefits of JTA to the subset of patients involves greater benefit than currently available therapies on the market  including Synvisc one  made of hyaluronic acid ” said Prof. François Rieger  PhD  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of BioSenic. “As a result  BioSenic will be looking to make JTA available to the patients heavily affected by severe KOA as quickly as possible.

The benchmark index Sensex fell 372 points to close at 61 560.64.

Nifty closed the session below 18 200 points. While the broader markets outperformed with Nifty Smallcap 100 index ending on a positive note.“In response to weak global sentiments  domestic investors remained cautious as the US market grappled with recession concerns led by recent economic data indicating slowdown. The US retail sales figures for April reflected a decrease in demand  and ongoing debt ceiling negotiations further dampened market sentiment  ” said Vinod Nair  Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services “Amid the selling pressure  the Nifty has managed to hold on to the crucial support level of 18100 and the intraday pullback has come exactly from around 18100  which indicates that until the Nifty manages to stay above this level the uptrend is intact. The upward sloping channel has been breached on the downside and the daily momentum indicator has a negative crossover which is a sign of weakness  and this can lead to consolidation over the next few trading sessions ” said Jatin Gedia  Technical Research Analyst  Sharekhan by BNP Paribas.That said  here’s a look at what some key indicators are suggesting for Thursday’s action:U.S. stock indexes rose on Wednesday after Western Alliance led a bounce among regional banks amid cautious optimism about a potential breakthrough in the deadlock in Washington over the nation's debt limit.Shares of US regional banks rose  led by a 12.6% rise in Western Alliance Bancorp as the lender's deposit growth exceeded $2 billion and brokerage Bank of America Global Research resumed coverage of the bank with a ""buy"" rating.

Sales momentum in Asset Management and UK Retail businesses affected by challenging market conditionsAs previously announced  Aegon has adjusted its reporting format to trading updates for the first and third quarters with a focus on selected key performance metrics  including operating capital generation  capital positions  and sales metrics. Aegon will report IFRS results for the first half-year and second half-year to align with a.s.r.’s reporting cycle.Statement of Lard Friese  CEO“Aegon has had a good start to the year. We delivered strong commercial growth and advanced our strategic priorities in the first quarter. I am pleased with the headway we are making despite persistent volatility in the financial markets.We have made good progress with preparations for the closing of the transaction to combine Aegon’s Dutch businesses with a.s.r. Thanks to the commitment and hard work of our colleagues  we remain on course to close the transaction in the second half of this year.During the first quarter  we continued to reallocate capital to those businesses where we can build leading positionsand generate attractive returns. We sold our Protection business in the UK and divested a legacy block of direct marketing business in Asia. At the same time  we strengthened our asset management capabilities through the acquisition of NIBC’s European Collateralized Loan Obligation activities.We delivered strong sales growth in all of our US Strategic Assets  and in our life insurance businesses in China and Brazil. In the UK Workplace business  we are also gaining traction as a growing number of new customers are entrusting their retirement savings to us. However  commercial momentum in our asset management and UK Retail businesses was affected by reduced investor confidence as a result of the challenging market conditions.Against a backdrop of persistent volatility in the financial markets  we maintained a strong balance sheet with EUR 1.4 billion Cash Capital at the Holding. The capital positions of all main units remained above their respective operating levels  benefiting from the actions we have taken in the past few years to improve our risk profile. Given our capital strength and our improved operational performance – as underscored by the growth in our operating capital generation – I am confident that we will deliver on our strategic commitments and on our 2023 financial guidance. I look forward to providing an update on our strategic plans and medium-term financial objectives at our Capital Markets Day on June 22  2023.”Media relations Investor relations Conference call including Q&A (9:00 a.m. CET) Carolien van der Giessen Jan Willem Weidema Audio webcast on aegon.com +31 (0) 6 1195 3367gcc@aegon.com +31 (0) 70 344 8028ir@aegon.com United States: +1 864 991 4103United Kingdom: +44 808 175 1536The Netherlands: +31 800 745 8377 Passcode: received upon registrationAdditional informationPresentationThe conference call presentation is available on aegon.com as of 7.00 a.m. CET.SupplementsAegon’s 1Q 2023 Trading update Supplement and other supplementary documents are available on aegon.com.Conference call including Q&AThe conference call starts at 9:00 am CET  with an audio webcast on aegon.com.

This reflects business growth  an improvement in claims experience  and lower expensesThe capital ratios of all three main units remain above their respective operating levels; Group Solvency II ratio increases to 210%As a result of the repurchase of shares related to the ongoing EUR 200 million share buyback program  Cash Capital at Holding decreases to EUR 1.4 billion  which is in the upper half of the operating rangeContinued progress on transformation agenda; on track for the closing of the transaction to combine Aegon’s Dutch businesses with a.s.r. in the second half of 2023Strong sales growth in US Strategic Assets  UK Workplace business  and life insurance businesses in China and Brazil. Sales momentum in Asset Management and UK Retail businesses affected by challenging market conditionsAs previously announced  Aegon has adjusted its reporting format to trading updates for the first and third quarters with a focus on selected key performance metrics  including operating capital generation  capital positions  and sales metrics. Aegon will report IFRS results for the first half-year and second half-year to align with a.s.r.’s reporting cycle.Statement of Lard Friese  CEO“Aegon has had a good start to the year. We delivered strong commercial growth and advanced our strategic priorities in the first quarter. I am pleased with the headway we are making despite persistent volatility in the financial markets.We have made good progress with preparations for the closing of the transaction to combine Aegon’s Dutch businesses with a.s.r. Thanks to the commitment and hard work of our colleagues  we remain on course to close the transaction in the second half of this year.During the first quarter  we continued to reallocate capital to those businesses where we can build leading positionsand generate attractive returns. We sold our Protection business in the UK and divested a legacy block of direct marketing business in Asia. At the same time  we strengthened our asset management capabilities through the acquisition of NIBC’s European Collateralized Loan Obligation activities.We delivered strong sales growth in all of our US Strategic Assets  and in our life insurance businesses in China and Brazil. In the UK Workplace business  we are also gaining traction as a growing number of new customers are entrusting their retirement savings to us. However  commercial momentum in our asset management and UK Retail businesses was affected by reduced investor confidence as a result of the challenging market conditions.Against a backdrop of persistent volatility in the financial markets  we maintained a strong balance sheet with EUR 1.4 billion Cash Capital at the Holding. The capital positions of all main units remained above their respective operating levels  benefiting from the actions we have taken in the past few years to improve our risk profile. Given our capital strength and our improved operational performance – as underscored by the growth in our operating capital generation – I am confident that we will deliver on our strategic commitments and on our 2023 financial guidance. I look forward to providing an update on our strategic plans and medium-term financial objectives at our Capital Markets Day on June 22  2023.”Media relations Investor relations Conference call including Q&A (9:00 a.m. CET) Carolien van der Giessen Jan Willem Weidema Audio webcast on aegon.com +31 (0) 6 1195 3367gcc@aegon.com +31 (0) 70 344 8028ir@aegon.com United States: +1 864 991 4103United Kingdom: +44 808 175 1536The Netherlands: +31 800 745 8377 Passcode: received upon registrationAdditional informationPresentationThe conference call presentation is available on aegon.com as of 7.00 a.m. CET.SupplementsAegon’s 1Q 2023 Trading update Supplement and other supplementary documents are available on aegon.com.Conference call including Q&AThe conference call starts at 9:00 am CET  with an audio webcast on aegon.com.

With an initial focus on five projects in various locations worldwide  the companies will jointly offer a range of end-to-end solutions to help clients and customers expedite progress toward their carbon-reduction goals.For Arcadis and Honeywell  this relationship strengthens the efforts that both organizations are making to help clients that are committed to improving outcomes related to ESG. The relationship is not exclusive  and both companies expect to add additional collaborations to enhance their offerings in this space.Data from the World Economic Forum suggests that approximately 80% of today's buildings will still be standing in 2050i – which means the challenge of controlling escalating energy use  particularly in older buildings  to meet carbon-reduction targets will increase over the coming decades. Many building owners and operators lack the expertise and technology to monitor and optimize energy performance  making it harder for them to initiate change in their organizations. Honeywell and Arcadis offer unique but complementary services to address these shortfalls and will work with clients and customers to map a path toward lower carbon emissions  while also improving resilience.For building owners who have already set goals and made pledges to reduce carbon footprint across their portfolio  the collaboration will deploy a software suite that applies milestones to document progress with tailored insights and data-led reports that showcase these efforts to internal and external stakeholders. Honeywell and Arcadis will also formulate strategic goals for organizations that do not have access to asset- or device-level energy performance data.Arcadis brings a deep background in evaluating business impacts across programs and portfolios. It assesses ESG risks for companies by developing current-state assessments that analyze technical and financial scenarios to measure impacts across energy and climate  materials and waste  and buildings and infrastructure. Arcadis also helps building owners include other ESG goals in the design of their real estate assets  such as climate adaptation  biodiversity  and inclusivity.""The strength of Arcadis is our ability to help clients identify where change can have the most impact in their organization when it comes to their energy use and carbon footprint "" said Alan Brookes  chief executive officer  Arcadis. ""By working with Honeywell  we can take that insight and provide an end-to-end service from planning to execution and ongoing maintenance to allow clients to reduce the energy use within their building portfolios and demonstrate the value of their investment to key stakeholders.""Honeywell brings decades of experience in developing smart-building technologies that utilize artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML)-enabled software to enhance control systems with sensor-driven analytics  occupancy tracking and predictive maintenance. The company also offers service solutions that help building owners fund improvements as operating expenses instead of capital investments.""By combining our ready-now advanced building controls software with Arcadis' expertise in sustainability assessments and roadmapping  we can develop plans for customers that meet both their short-term need to manage energy use and their long-term aspiration to reduce their carbon footprint "" said Billal Hammoud  president and chief executive officer  Honeywell Building Technologies. ""By drawing on our respective strengths  we can deliver more efficient and effective sustainability solutions for buildings.""Documenting and reporting sustainability efforts will only increase in importance as more and more regulatory actions are enacted. The Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)  for example  requires all large and listed companies to disclose information on risks and opportunities related to ESG issues and their impact on the environment.ii Through collaborations such as this one  Arcadis and Honeywell are creating an ecosystem of third-party solutions and complementary services to help clients and customers worldwide reduce their energy consumption and carbon emissions.FOR FURTHER INFORMATION PLEASE CONTACT:ARCADIS CORPORATE COMMUNICATIONSKerri MooreMobile: +44 7821 836890E-mail: [email protected]ARCADIS INVESTOR RELATIONSChristine DischMobile: +31 6 15376020E-mail: [email protected]HONEYWELLDawn WotapkaMobile: +1 631 943 3782Email: [email protected]ABOUT ARCADISArcadis is the leading global design & consultancy organization for natural and built assets.

As part of the event  Tarkett  a worldwide leader in innovative and sustainable flooring solutions  will welcome design professionals into its Chicago Fulton Market showroom at 215 N. Peoria Street  Floor 10  for a firsthand look at how the company is redefining its approach to design.""The only way to create the future we want is by building it together."" Tweet this Tarkett’s Collaborative collection  which will be introduced during Design Days  was inspired by the process of coming together as individuals to build and create.In recent years  we've had the opportunity to rethink culture  how communities engage  and how to support an inspiring environment  wherever that may be. At the foundation of culture is connectivity  the driving factor in returning to a shared workspace and an important influence on overall well-being. The unique process of collaboration with all its facets remains at the core of creating and producing as a team. It was this process of coming together as individuals to build and create that inspired Tarkett's Collaborative collection  which will be introduced at Design Days.The new collection emerged from a collaborative mark-making process led by Tarkett's vice president of design for its commercial business  Omoleye Simmons  who joined the company in September. As a former art educator  Simmons has experience coaching designers in technology and concept development  translating art to product. That process is evident in the collection's design patterns  which were created by layering the marks of different team members  integrating and transforming them into something much greater than the sum of its parts.""In creating this collection  our goal was to celebrate hyper collaboration through cooperative artwork "" Simmons said. ""We embarked on a hands-on exploration that included mark-making  spraying and brushing watercolor paint  and layering paper. We experimented across design studios  sharing steps in the design process—selecting each others' creations to merge with our own and offering feedback along the way.""All this experiential  shared effort culminated in the Collaborative collection  which includes a variety of LVT and soft-surface options. The collection's mix of patterns and platforms—spanning carpet tile  Powerbond and LVT—provides spaces with agility to meet changing demands. The collection offers solutions for busy  collaborative areas as well as quiet  heads-down zones  enabling an environment that embraces neurodiverse work styles.Like all Tarkett flooring  the Collaborative collection contributes to safe  healthy interiors and supports better indoor air quality; in fact  Powerbond® RS is the first soft-surface flooring with the asthma & allergy friendly® certification. As further evidence of the company's holistic commitment to optimizing materials and minimizing climate impact  Tarkett's near-term science-based emissions reduction targets were validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) in January.""As passionate advocates of the circular economy  we know that driving change for a better future is a collective effort "" said Paul Young  senior vice president  product  innovation  design & sustainability  Tarkett North America. ""With the Collaborative collection  we explore this process through creativity and inclusivity—because the only way to create the future we want is by building it together.""Tarkett Co.Lab™ Encourages Collaboration and CommunityDuring Design Days  Tarkett's showroom will become the Co.Lab™  emphasizing the power of collaboration and community through a series of educational sessions  hands-on artistic activities and panel discussions with some of the leading voices from the design industry.

We further deleveraged our balance sheet  reducing net debt by €130 million in the quarter. The Group remains intensely focused on streamlining its operations and executing the New Vallourec plan. “We continue to see 2023 as a transformational year for Vallourec. Our major capability enhancement program is underway in Brazil  which will increase the markets addressable by our South America Tubes operation. Meanwhile  we are proceeding with the ramp-down of our assets in Germany  with continued expectations of production stoppage at the end of 2023. Across all regions  our team remains focused on providing quality products to our customers while we execute this industrial realignment. “As we look into the second quarter  we expect EBITDA to be similar to the results achieved in Q1 2023. While we expect a moderate sequential decline in U.S. pricing  we are maximizing the value we receive for our products. Additionally  our booking momentum outside of North America remains strong  and the price trend in all OCTG markets outside of North America remains positive. “We reiterate our expectation for EBITDA to improve year-over-year in 2023 and expect it will be somewhat weighted toward the first half of the year. In the second half of 2023  we will likely see some earnings degradation from our planned volume ramp-down in Germany and the previously-noted sequential declines in U.S. pricing. That said  it is important to note that we continue to expect the full effect of the New Vallourec plan starting in Q2 2024  with a meaningful portion of the €230 million annualized benefit to be realized in 2024. “Additionally  we continue to expect to reduce net debt this year without taking into account any potential benefit of asset sales. We reiterate our target to reach zero net debt by year-end 2025 at the latest  a key step in cycle-proofing our business.” Key Datain € million  unless noted Q1 2023 Q4 2022 Q1 2022 QoQ chg. YoY chg.

The increase in Group revenues reflects: 9% volume increase mainly driven by Oil & Gas in North America26% price/mix effect6% Mine and Forest5% currency effect mainly related to weaker EUR/USD and EUR/BRL In the First Quarter of 2023  EBITDA amounted to €320 million compared with €45 million in Q1 2022; the EBITDA margin reached 23.9% of revenues versus 4.9% in Q1 2022. For the Group  the EBITDA increase reflects: An industrial margin of €41 2 million  or 30 . 8 % of revenues   versus €129 million or 14.1% of revenues in Q1 2022. The positive contribution of the Oil & Gas market in North America  both in prices and volumes  was supplemented by a recovery in iron ore volumes.  versus €129 million or 14.1% of revenues in Q1 2022. The positive contribution of the Oil & Gas market in North America  both in prices and volumes  was supplemented by a recovery in iron ore volumes. Selling  general and administrative expenses (SG&A) of €79 million or 5.9% of revenues  versus €85 million or 9.3% in Q1 2022. Operating income was positive at €257 million  compared to (€17) million in Q1 2022. Financial income (loss) was negative at (€46) million  compared with (€13) million in Q1 2022 driven by FX losses among others; net interest expenses in Q1 2023 stood at (€26) million compared to (€22) million in Q1 2022. Income tax amounted to (€53) million compared to (€3) million in Q1 2022. This resulted in positive net income  Group share  of €156 million  compared to (€35) million in Q1 2022. RESULTS ANALYSIS BY SEGMENT Tubes In Q1 2023  Tubes revenues were up 40% on the back of strong pricing. Tubes EBITDA rose significantly from €56 million to €279 million based on a 9% increase in volumes  coupled with a 28% increase in the average selling price per tonne. Mine and Forest In Q1 2023  the iron ore mine production sold reached 1.5 million tonnes  compared to 0.1 million tonnes in Q1 2022. The low result in Q1 2022 was a consequence of the waste pile slippage incident at the beginning of 2022. Mine and Forest revenues in Q1 2023 reached €93 million  increasing strongly year-on-year (€24 million in Q1 2022). In Q1 2023  Mine and Forest EBITDA reached €48 million  leading to an EBITDA margin of 52%. CASH FLOW AND FINANCIAL POSITION Enhanced Cash Flow Disclosures Vallourec has enhanced its previous cash flow disclosures to increase transparency during the implementation of the New Vallourec plan. Vallourec has received feedback from users of its financial information that indicates difficulty ascertaining the total cash impacts of the New Vallourec plan on Group cash generation  estimating the potential cash flows of the Group following the completion of the New Vallourec plan  and reconciling the Group’s actual net debt reduction and its prior “free cash flow” metric. While Vallourec believes its reporting has been well-detailed from the perspective of the consolidated income statement  feedback from users has indicated that a clearer separation of the cash flows of Vallourec’s underlying business and non-recurring items is required. Therefore  Vallourec has added the following KPIs: Adjusted operating cash flow  which demonstrates the Group’s cash flow from operating activities excluding the impact of restructuring charges & non-recurring itemswhich demonstrates the Group’s cash flow from operating activities excluding the impact of restructuring charges & non-recurring items Adjusted free cash flow  which is the Group’s adjusted operating cash flow +/- the change in operating working capital and gross capital expenditureswhich is the Group’s adjusted operating cash flow +/- the change in operating working capital and gross capital expenditures Total cash generation  which accounts for all cash items that affect the Group’s change in net debt in a given financial periodTables detailing the calculation of these measures and their reconciliation to previously-reported metrics are presented in the Appendices of this press release. Vallourec emphasizes that no change in its internal management incentive metrics or its 2023 outlook presented as of March 2  2023 has occurred as a result of this change. (a) Importantly  Vallourec notes that no potential asset sales proceeds are assumed in its expectations of net debt reduction in 2023. Please see “Definitions of non-GAAP financial data” at the back of this press release for further information. Cash Flow Results Analysis In Q1 2023  adjusted operating cash flow improved to €299 million  compared to €40 million in Q1 2022  as higher EBITDA and lower income tax payments more than offset the increase in financial cash out. In Q1 2023  the operating working capital requirement increased by €52 million  versus a strong increase of €216 million in Q1 2022. The net working capital requirement stood at 94 days of sales  compared to 125 days in Q1 2022. Gross capital expenditure was €53 million in Q1 2023  compared with €34 million in Q1 2022.For the full year  gross capital expenditure is expected to be around €220 million  including approximately €70 million of capital expenditures related to the transfer of German Oil & Gas volumes to Brazil. In Q1 2023  adjusted free cash flow was positive at €194 million  compared with (€210) million in Q1 2022. In Q1 2023  total cash generation stood at €151 million  which includes the impact of €47 million restructuring charges and other non-recurring items as well as €4 million of asset disposals and other cash items. In Q1 2023  free cash flow  as previously defined  was €147 million  compared with (€230) million in Q1 2022. Net Debt and Liquidity As of March 31  2023  net debt stood at €1.0 billion  compared with €1.1 billion on December 31  2022. Gross debt amounted to €1.9 billion including €65 million of fair value adjustment under IFRS 9 (which will be reversed over the life of the debt). Long-term debt amounted to €1.4 billion and short-term debt totaled €532 million. As of March 31  2023  lease debt stood at €65 million following the application of IFRS 16 standards  compared with €71 million on December 31  2022. As of March 31  2023  the liquidity position was strong at €1.4 billion  with cash amounting to €894 million  availability on our revolving credit facility (RCF) of €312 million (b)  and availability on an asset-backed loan (ABL) of €185 million (c). The Group has no long-term debt repayments scheduled before June 2026. THE PAU BRANCO IRON ORE MINE TO RESUME FULL PRODUCTION Operations at Vallourec’s Pau Branco iron ore mine were temporarily suspended in January 2022 following slippage at its Cachoeirinha waste pile. Operations were partially restarted in May 2022 using alternative waste piles  albeit at lower-than-normal capacity levels. Production sold in Q1 was 1.5 million tonnes and April production sold was approximately 0.6 million tonnes despite capacity constraints due to the use of these alternative waste piles. On May 5  2023  Vallourec obtained the necessary permissions from the state mining and environmental authorities for the full release of the Cachoeirinha waste pile. We expect the Pau Branco iron ore mine to return to full production in Q2 2023. NEW VALLOUREC PLAN UPDATES The New Vallourec plan  announced in May 2022  remains fully on track. The plan aims to generate €230 million of recurring EBITDA uplift and an approximately €20 million capex reduction with the full impact starting in Q2 2024. It will contribute to making the Group cycle-proof and generating positive free cash flow  before the change in working capital  even at the bottom of the cycle. Employees at the sites to be closed in Europe have begun to leave the company in Q1 2023. The last wave of departures is expected in 2024  including those colleagues in Germany who are supporting the dismantling operation in that year. Meanwhile  Vallourec is now ramping up its capital investment program in Brazil to assure the full transfer of Oil & Gas volumes from Germany throughout the course of 2023. In February 2023  we signed a contract to sell our Mülheim site for €40 million. This sale process is ongoing and closing is not expected in the near-term. The sale process for our much larger site in Duesseldorf-Rath is progressing. Vallourec aims to achieve best-in-class profitability levels and close the margin gap with peers over the cycle. SECOND QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2023 OUTLOOK For the second quarter of the year  based on our assumptions and current market conditions  the Group expects: Robust revenues in Tubes as International price improvement offsets a moderate sequential U.S. declineas International price improvement offsets a moderate sequential U.S. decline Mine and Forest volumes to return to full production in Q2 2023. The sequential volume increase will be offset by lower market pricesvolumes to return to full production in Q2 2023. The sequential volume increase will be offset by lower market prices EBITDA to be similar to Q1 2023 and up substantially year-over-yearand up substantially year-over-year Total cash generation to be around breakeven due to an assumed temporary intra-year increase of working capital The Group additionally reiterates and supplements its Full Year 2023 Outlook  which includes the following: EBITDA is expected to improve vs. 2022. We expect somewhat first half-weighted EBITDA generation as sequential declines in U.S. pricing are partially offset by improvement in International marketsWe expect somewhat first half-weighted EBITDA generation as sequential declines in U.S. pricing are partially offset by improvement in International markets Net d ebt is expected to decline vs . 2022Free cash flow  as previously defined  and total cash generation are expected to be positive  excluding any potential benefit from asset sales and assuming higher year-over-year tax payments  approximately €220 million gross capital expenditures and restructuring and non-recurring items moderately below €350 million.Information and Forward-Looking Statements This press release includes forward-looking statements.

It corresponds to net cash used in operating activities less restructuring and non-recurring items +/- gross capital expenditure. Adjusted operating cash flow is defined as EBITDA adjusted for non-cash benefits and expenses  financial cash out and tax payments. Asset disposals and other cash items includes cash inflows from asset sales as well as other investing and financing cash flows (e.g. loan reimbursements). Change in working capital refers to the change in the operating working capital requirement. Data at constant exchange rates: The data presented “at constant exchange rates” is calculated by eliminating the translation effect into euros for the revenue of the Group’s entities whose functional currency is not the euro. The translation effect is eliminated by applying Year N-1 exchange rates to Year N revenue of the contemplated entities. EBITDA: Earnings Before Interest  Taxes  Depreciation and Amortization is calculated by taking operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization  and excluding certain operating revenues and expenses that are unusual in nature or occur rarely  such as: impairment of goodwill and non-current assets as determined within the scope of impairment tests carried out in accordance with IAS 36;significant restructuring expenses  particularly resulting from headcount reorganization measures  in respect of major events or decisions;capital gains or losses on disposals;income and expenses resulting from major litigation  significant roll-outs or capital transactions (e.g.  costs of integrating a new activity). Financial cash out includes interest payments on financial and lease debt  interest income and other financial costs. Free cash flow  as previously defined  may continue to be derived as follows: total cash generation - asset disposals & other cash items. This is also defined as EBITDA adjusted for changes in provisions  less interest and tax payments  changes in working capital  less gross capital expenditures  and less restructuring/other cash outflows. Gross capital expenditure: gross capital expenditure is defined as the sum of cash outflows for acquisitions of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets and cash outflows for acquisitions of biological assets. (Increase) decrease in net debt (alternatively  “change in net debt”) is defined as total cash generation +/- non-cash adjustments to net debt. Industrial margin: The industrial margin is defined as the difference between revenue and cost of sales (i.e. after allocation of industrial variable costs and industrial fixed costs)  before depreciation. Lease debt is defined as the present value of unavoidable future lease payments. Net debt: Consolidated net debt (or “net financial debt”) is defined as bank loans and other borrowings plus overdrafts and other short-term borrowings minus cash and cash equivalents. Net debt excludes lease debt. Net working capital requirement is defined as working capital requirement net of provisions for inventories and trade receivables; net working capital requirement days are computed on an annualized quarterly sales basis. Non-cash adjustments to net debt includes non-cash foreign exchange impacts on debt balances  IFRS-defined fair value adjustments on debt balances  and other non-cash items. Non-cash items in EBITDA includes provisions and other non-cash items in EBITDA. Operating working capital requirement includes working capital requirement as well as other receivables and payables. Restructuring charges and non-recurring items consists primarily of the cash costs of executing the New Vallourec plan  including severance costs and other facility closure costs. Total cash generation is defined as adjusted free cash flow +/- restructuring charges and non-recurring items and asset disposals & other cash items. It corresponds to net cash used in operating activities +/- gross capital expenditure and asset disposals & other cash items. Working capital requirement is defined as trade receivables plus inventories minus trade payables (excluding provisions). a The Group maintains its guidance for positive free cash flow for 2023. It is further clarified that considering the change in cash flow metrics  the notion of free cash flow is replaced by total cash generation restated for asset disposals & other cash items. The change of cash flow metrics also has no impact on any other guidance provided by the Group.

We further deleveraged our balance sheet  reducing net debt by €130 million in the quarter. The Group remains intensely focused on streamlining its operations and executing the New Vallourec plan.“We continue to see 2023 as a transformational year for Vallourec. Our major capability enhancement program is underway in Brazil  which will increase the markets addressable by our South America Tubes operation. Meanwhile  we are proceeding with the ramp-down of our assets in Germany  with continued expectations of production stoppage at the end of 2023. Across all regions  our team remains focused on providing quality products to our customers while we execute this industrial realignment.“As we look into the second quarter  we expect EBITDA to be similar to the results achieved in Q1 2023. While we expect a moderate sequential decline in U.S. pricing  we are maximizing the value we receive for our products. Additionally  our booking momentum outside of North America remains strong  and the price trend in all OCTG markets outside of North America remains positive.“We reiterate our expectation for EBITDA to improve year-over-year in 2023 and expect it will be somewhat weighted toward the first half of the year. In the second half of 2023  we will likely see some earnings degradation from our planned volume ramp-down in Germany and the previously-noted sequential declines in U.S. pricing. That said  it is important to note that we continue to expect the full effect of the New Vallourec plan starting in Q2 2024  with a meaningful portion of the €230 million annualized benefit to be realized in 2024.“Additionally  we continue to expect to reduce net debt this year without taking into account any potential benefit of asset sales. We reiterate our target to reach zero net debt by year-end 2025 at the latest  a key step in cycle-proofing our business.”Key Datain € million  unless noted Q1 2023 Q4 2022 Q1 2022 QoQ chg. YoY chg.

The increase in Group revenues reflects:9% volume increase mainly driven by Oil & Gas in North America26% price/mix effect6% Mine and Forest5% currency effect mainly related to weaker EUR/USD and EUR/BRLIn the First Quarter of 2023  EBITDA amounted to €320 million compared with €45 million in Q1 2022; the EBITDA margin reached 23.9% of revenues versus 4.9% in Q1 2022. For the Group  the EBITDA increase reflects:An industrial margin of €41 2 million  or 30 . 8 % of revenues   versus €129 million or 14.1% of revenues in Q1 2022. The positive contribution of the Oil & Gas market in North America  both in prices and volumes  was supplemented by a recovery in iron ore volumes.  versus €129 million or 14.1% of revenues in Q1 2022. The positive contribution of the Oil & Gas market in North America  both in prices and volumes  was supplemented by a recovery in iron ore volumes. Selling  general and administrative expenses (SG&A) of €79 million or 5.9% of revenues  versus €85 million or 9.3% in Q1 2022.Operating income was positive at €257 million  compared to (€17) million in Q1 2022.Financial income (loss) was negative at (€46) million  compared with (€13) million in Q1 2022 driven by FX losses among others; net interest expenses in Q1 2023 stood at (€26) million compared to (€22) million in Q1 2022.Income tax amounted to (€53) million compared to (€3) million in Q1 2022.This resulted in positive net income  Group share  of €156 million  compared to (€35) million in Q1 2022.RESULTS ANALYSIS BY SEGMENTTubesIn Q1 2023  Tubes revenues were up 40% on the back of strong pricing. Tubes EBITDA rose significantly from €56 million to €279 million based on a 9% increase in volumes  coupled with a 28% increase in the average selling price per tonne.Mine and ForestIn Q1 2023  the iron ore mine production sold reached 1.5 million tonnes  compared to 0.1 million tonnes in Q1 2022. The low result in Q1 2022 was a consequence of the waste pile slippage incident at the beginning of 2022.Mine and Forest revenues in Q1 2023 reached €93 million  increasing strongly year-on-year (€24 million in Q1 2022). In Q1 2023  Mine and Forest EBITDA reached €48 million  leading to an EBITDA margin of 52%.CASH FLOW AND FINANCIAL POSITIONEnhanced Cash Flow DisclosuresVallourec has enhanced its previous cash flow disclosures to increase transparency during the implementation of the New Vallourec plan. Vallourec has received feedback from users of its financial information that indicates difficulty ascertaining the total cash impacts of the New Vallourec plan on Group cash generation  estimating the potential cash flows of the Group following the completion of the New Vallourec plan  and reconciling the Group’s actual net debt reduction and its prior “free cash flow” metric.While Vallourec believes its reporting has been well-detailed from the perspective of the consolidated income statement  feedback from users has indicated that a clearer separation of the cash flows of Vallourec’s underlying business and non-recurring items is required. Therefore  Vallourec has added the following KPIs:Adjusted operating cash flow  which demonstrates the Group’s cash flow from operating activities excluding the impact of restructuring charges & non-recurring itemswhich demonstrates the Group’s cash flow from operating activities excluding the impact of restructuring charges & non-recurring items Adjusted free cash flow  which is the Group’s adjusted operating cash flow +/- the change in operating working capital and gross capital expenditureswhich is the Group’s adjusted operating cash flow +/- the change in operating working capital and gross capital expenditures Total cash generation  which accounts for all cash items that affect the Group’s change in net debt in a given financial periodTables detailing the calculation of these measures and their reconciliation to previously-reported metrics are presented in the Appendices of this press release. Vallourec emphasizes that no change in its internal management incentive metrics or its 2023 outlook presented as of March 2  2023 has occurred as a result of this change. (a) Importantly  Vallourec notes that no potential asset sales proceeds are assumed in its expectations of net debt reduction in 2023.Please see “Definitions of non-GAAP financial data” at the back of this press release for further information.Cash Flow Results AnalysisIn Q1 2023  adjusted operating cash flow improved to €299 million  compared to €40 million in Q1 2022  as higher EBITDA and lower income tax payments more than offset the increase in financial cash out.In Q1 2023  the operating working capital requirement increased by €52 million  versus a strong increase of €216 million in Q1 2022. The net working capital requirement stood at 94 days of sales  compared to 125 days in Q1 2022.Gross capital expenditure was €53 million in Q1 2023  compared with €34 million in Q1 2022.For the full year  gross capital expenditure is expected to be around €220 million  including approximately €70 million of capital expenditures related to the transfer of German Oil & Gas volumes to Brazil.In Q1 2023  adjusted free cash flow was positive at €194 million  compared with (€210) million in Q1 2022.In Q1 2023  total cash generation stood at €151 million  which includes the impact of €47 million restructuring charges and other non-recurring items as well as €4 million of asset disposals and other cash items.In Q1 2023  free cash flow  as previously defined  was €147 million  compared with (€230) million in Q1 2022.Net Debt and LiquidityAs of March 31  2023  net debt stood at €1.0 billion  compared with €1.1 billion on December 31  2022. Gross debt amounted to €1.9 billion including €65 million of fair value adjustment under IFRS 9 (which will be reversed over the life of the debt). Long-term debt amounted to €1.4 billion and short-term debt totaled €532 million.As of March 31  2023  lease debt stood at €65 million following the application of IFRS 16 standards  compared with €71 million on December 31  2022.As of March 31  2023  the liquidity position was strong at €1.4 billion  with cash amounting to €894 million  availability on our revolving credit facility (RCF) of €312 million (b)  and availability on an asset-backed loan (ABL) of €185 million (c). The Group has no long-term debt repayments scheduled before June 2026.THE PAU BRANCO IRON ORE MINE TO RESUME FULL PRODUCTIONOperations at Vallourec’s Pau Branco iron ore mine were temporarily suspended in January 2022 following slippage at its Cachoeirinha waste pile. Operations were partially restarted in May 2022 using alternative waste piles  albeit at lower-than-normal capacity levels. Production sold in Q1 was 1.5 million tonnes and April production sold was approximately 0.6 million tonnes despite capacity constraints due to the use of these alternative waste piles.On May 5  2023  Vallourec obtained the necessary permissions from the state mining and environmental authorities for the full release of the Cachoeirinha waste pile. We expect the Pau Branco iron ore mine to return to full production in Q2 2023.NEW VALLOUREC PLAN UPDATESThe New Vallourec plan  announced in May 2022  remains fully on track. The plan aims to generate €230 million of recurring EBITDA uplift and an approximately €20 million capex reduction with the full impact starting in Q2 2024. It will contribute to making the Group cycle-proof and generating positive free cash flow  before the change in working capital  even at the bottom of the cycle.Employees at the sites to be closed in Europe have begun to leave the company in Q1 2023. The last wave of departures is expected in 2024  including those colleagues in Germany who are supporting the dismantling operation in that year. Meanwhile  Vallourec is now ramping up its capital investment program in Brazil to assure the full transfer of Oil & Gas volumes from Germany throughout the course of 2023.In February 2023  we signed a contract to sell our Mülheim site for €40 million. This sale process is ongoing and closing is not expected in the near-term. The sale process for our much larger site in Duesseldorf-Rath is progressing.Vallourec aims to achieve best-in-class profitability levels and close the margin gap with peers over the cycle.SECOND QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2023 OUTLOOKFor the second quarter of the year  based on our assumptions and current market conditions  the Group expects:Robust revenues in Tubes as International price improvement offsets a moderate sequential U.S. declineas International price improvement offsets a moderate sequential U.S. decline Mine and Forest volumes to return to full production in Q2 2023. The sequential volume increase will be offset by lower market pricesvolumes to return to full production in Q2 2023. The sequential volume increase will be offset by lower market prices EBITDA to be similar to Q1 2023 and up substantially year-over-yearand up substantially year-over-year Total cash generation to be around breakeven due to an assumed temporary intra-year increase of working capitalThe Group additionally reiterates and supplements its Full Year 2023 Outlook  which includes the following:EBITDA is expected to improve vs. 2022. We expect somewhat first half-weighted EBITDA generation as sequential declines in U.S. pricing are partially offset by improvement in International marketsWe expect somewhat first half-weighted EBITDA generation as sequential declines in U.S. pricing are partially offset by improvement in International markets Net d ebt is expected to decline vs . 2022Free cash flow  as previously defined  and total cash generation are expected to be positive  excluding any potential benefit from asset sales and assuming higher year-over-year tax payments  approximately €220 million gross capital expenditures and restructuring and non-recurring items moderately below €350 million.Information and Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release includes forward-looking statements.

Aegonplein 50 2591 TV THE HAGUE The Netherlands Aegon's press release  dated May 17  2023  is included as appendix and incorporated herein by reference. SIGNATURE Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934  the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned  thereunto duly authorized. AEGON N.V. (Registrant) Date: May 17  2023 By /s/ J.H.P.M. van Rossum J.H.P.M. van Rossum Executive Vice President and Head of Corporate Financial Center The Hague - May 17  2023 Aegon's trading update for the first quarter 2023 Consistent delivery on strategic and financial objectives in a volatile market · Operating capital generation before holding funding and operating expenses increases by 5% compared with the first quarter of 2022 to EUR 292 million. This reflects business growth  an improvement in claims experience  and lower expenses · The capital ratios of all three main units remain above their respective operating levels; Group Solvency II ratio increases to 210% · As a result of the repurchase of shares related to the ongoing EUR 200 million share buyback program  Cash Capital at Holding decreases to EUR 1.4 billion  which is in the upper half of the operating range · Continued progress on transformation agenda; on track for the closing of the transaction to combine Aegon's Dutch businesses with a.s.r. in the second half of 2023 · Strong sales growth in US Strategic Assets  UK Workplace business  and life insurance businesses in China and Brazil. Sales momentum in Asset Management and UK Retail businesses affected by challenging market conditions As previously announced  Aegon has adjusted its reporting format to trading updates for the first and third quarters with a focus on selected key performance metrics  including operating capital generation  capital positions  and sales metrics. Aegon will report IFRS results for the first half-year and second half-year to align with a.s.r.'s reporting cycle. Statement of Lard Friese  CEO ""Aegon has had a good start to the year. We delivered strong commercial growth and advanced our strategic priorities in the first quarter. I am pleased with the headway we are making despite persistent volatility in the financial markets. We have made good progress with preparations for the closing of the transaction to combine Aegon's Dutch businesses with a.s.r. Thanks to the commitment and hard work of our colleagues  we remain on course to close the transaction in the second half of this year. During the first quarter  we continued to reallocate capital to those businesses where we can build leading positions and generate attractive returns. We sold our Protection business in the UK and divested a legacy block of direct marketing business in Asia. At the same time  we strengthened our asset management capabilities through the acquisition of NIBC's European Collateralized Loan Obligation activities. We delivered strong sales growth in all of our US Strategic Assets  and in our life insurance businesses in China and Brazil. In the UK Workplace business  we are also gaining traction as a growing number of new customers are entrusting their retirement savings to us. However  commercial momentum in our asset management and UK Retail businesses was affected by reduced investor confidence as a result of the challenging market conditions. Against a backdrop of persistent volatility in the financial markets  we maintained a strong balance sheet with EUR 1.4 billion Cash Capital at the Holding. The capital positions of all main units remained above their respective operating levels  benefiting from the actions we have taken in the past few years to improve our risk profile. Given our capital strength and our improved operational performance - as underscored by the growth in our operating capital generation - I am confident that we will deliver on our strategic commitments and on our 2023 financial guidance. I look forward to providing an update on our strategic plans and medium-term financial objectives at our Capital Markets Day on June 22  2023.""

Aegon focuses on three core markets (the United States  the Netherlands  and the United Kingdom)  three growth markets (Spain & Portugal  Brazil  and China) and one global asset manager. Aegon's businesses within its core markets have been separated into Financial Assets and Strategic Assets. The aim is to release capital from Financial Assets and from businesses outside of Aegon's core perimeter  and to re-allocate capital to growth opportunities in Strategic Assets  growth markets and the global asset manager. In this press release  Aegon provides an update on the strategic developments and business performance in its four key reporting segments: · Americas; · United Kingdom; · Asset Management; and · International. On October 27  2022  Aegon announced that it had reached an agreement with a.s.r. to combine its Dutch pension  life and non-life insurance  banking  and mortgage origination activities with a.s.r. In light of that action  Aegon the Netherlands is no longer reported as a separate segment. Throughout its transformation  Aegon aims to maintain a solid capital position in its business units and at the Holding. Through proactive risk management actions  Aegon is improving its risk profile and reducing the volatility of its capital ratios. This is underscored by the capital strength reported in this trading update. 2023 Capital Markets Day On June 22  2023  Aegon will host a Capital Markets Day to provide an update on its strategy and medium-term financial targets. This will include plans to profitably grow its businesses and maximize the value from Financial Assets  with a focus on Aegon's largest business unit  Transamerica. 1Q 2023 Trading update - 2 The Hague - May 17  2023 Business update Americas Aegon Americas unaudited Business update USD millions Notes 1Q 2023 1Q 2022 % Individual Solutions 113 94 21 Workplace Solutions 27 21 31 New life sales (recurring plus 1/10 single) 140 114 23 New premium production accident & health insurance 40 54 (27) Individual Solutions (1 220) (2 081) 41 Workplace Solutions 285 (69) n.m.

In the first quarter  Transamerica made important progress in achieving these objectives. New life sales The Individual Solutions business generated new life sales of USD 113 million in the first quarter of 2023. This is an increase of 21% compared with the first quarter of last year  and was supported by all distribution channels. Distribution benefited from a record-high number of WFG agents  revitalized relationships in the brokerage and agent channels  as well as improvements in the underwriting process that led to higher productivity. The increase was driven by higher indexed universal life and term life product sales  while whole life sales remained broadly stable in a competitive market. Transamerica introduced a new indexed universal life product this quarter specifically designed for the brokerage distribution channel  that complements the current product that is successfully marketed through World Financial Group (WFG)  with the objective to broaden its distribution reach. The improved service experience for WFG agents combined with the continued competitiveness of Transamerica's products led to a market share in the WFG distribution channel of 64% in the first quarter of 2023  compared with 58% a year earlier. WFG further expanded its distribution reach by growing the number of licensed agents to a record level of close to 67 000  an increase of more than ten thousand agents compared with the prior year quarter. Net deposits Net outflows for Mutual Funds of USD 21 million improved compared with USD 431 million of net outflows in the first quarter of 2022. The increase in equity markets during the quarter led to a significant reduction in redemptions. 1Q 2023 Trading update - 3 The Hague - May 17  2023 Net outflows in Variable Annuities amounted to USD 1.0 billion this quarter compared with USD 1.5 billion in the first quarter of 2022  in line with expectations. This is mainly a consequence of lower account values compared with the prior year period as a result of market movements  and outflows related to the lump-sum buyout program for certain variable annuities policies in the first quarter of last year. Net outflows in the run-off Fixed Annuities book amounted to USD 159 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared with USD 154 million of net outflows in the same quarter last year. Business update Workplace Solutions In the US Workplace Solutions business  Transamerica aims to compete as a top-five player in new sales in the Middle-Market segment of Retirement Plans. As in the Individual Solutions business  Transamerica saw good progress during the first quarter in Workplace Solutions. Middle-Market written sales Written sales were USD 2.6 billion in the first quarter of 2023  which is an increase of USD 1.3 billion compared with the same quarter of 2022. The main driver of the increase was a pooled plan sale of USD 1.7 billion that included 1 400 individual employer plans. Net deposits Retirement Plans net deposits amounted to USD 346 million in the first quarter of 2023  while the same quarter last year saw net outflows of USD 34 million. Net deposits for the Middle-Market amounted to USD 932 million compared with USD 288 million of net deposits in the first quarter of 2022  which reflects the benefits from strong sales in prior periods and lower withdrawals in this year's first quarter. In the first quarter of 2023  the Large-Market segment of Retirement Plans saw net outflows of USD 934 million compared with net outflows of USD 588 million in the first quarter of 2022. A portion of the Large-Market withdrawals were retained in individual retirement accounts (IRAs)  which generated USD 349 million of net deposits from asset consolidation and customer retention efforts by the Advice Center in the first quarter of 2023. New life sales New life sales in Workplace Solutions increased by 31% compared with the first quarter 2022 to USD 27 million. This USD 7 million increase was equally driven by indexed universal life and term life sales. New premium production accident & health For accident & health insurance  new premium production was USD 40 million  a decrease of USD 14 million compared with the prior year's quarter mainly driven by lower supplemental health product sales. Business update Financial Assets - in-force management Financial Assets are blocks of business that are capital intensive with relatively low returns on capital employed. New sales for these blocks are limited and focused on products with higher returns and a moderate risk profile. Transamerica is actively managing variable annuities with interest rate sensitive riders  fixed annuities  and long-term care as Financial Assets. Variable Annuities The variable annuity portfolio is a de-risked legacy block that will run off over time. In 2021  Transamerica expanded the dynamic hedge program to cover all guaranteed benefits embedded in variable annuity contracts. In the first quarter of 2023  Transamerica achieved a hedge effectiveness of 97% for this program  continuing its strong track record of hedging these guarantees against financial market risks. The company does remain exposed to the impact of equity markets on variable annuity base contract fees. 1Q 2023 Trading update - 4 The Hague - May 17  2023 Total capital generation from Variable Annuities was a loss of USD 24 million  as the operating capital generation for this line of business together with better than expected equity market returns were more than offset by losses from fund basis risk. Long-term care Transamerica is actively managing its long-term care business  with premium rate increase programs being the primary management actions. The total value of state approvals for premium rate increases achieved since the start of these programs now stands at USD 513 million  with USD 42 million of additional approvals for rate increases obtained in the first quarter of 2023. Transamerica will continue to work with state regulators to get pending and future actuarially justified rate increases approved. Claims experience for the long-term care business was slightly better than according to expectations in the first quarter of 2023. 1Q 2023 Trading update - 5 The Hague - May 17  2023 Business update United Kingdom United Kingdom unaudited Business update GBP millions Notes 1Q 2023 1Q 2022 % Retail platform (413) 23 n.m.

Below is an overview of recent strategic developments and an update on business performance. Strategic developments On April 4  2023  Aegon announced the sale of its UK individual protection book to Royal London. The transaction supports Aegon UK's strategy to focus on the platform activities. As a consequence of the agreement  the individual protection book has been closed for new business. Aegon UK will initially reinsure the portfolio to Royal London  and will ultimately transfer legal ownership to Royal London through a Part VII transfer in 2024  subject to court approval. Business update Net deposits Net deposits in the Workplace segment of the platform amounted to GBP 733 million  and were higher than the GBP 701 million achieved in the comparable quarter of 2022. This was driven by the onboarding of new schemes and higher net deposits on existing schemes. Aegon UK has launched a new range of sustainability-focused funds to its customers - including those funds offered by Aegon Asset Management - to support growth in the Master Trust Workplace market segment. For Retail  net outflows amounted to GBP 413 million compared with net deposits of GBP 23 million in the comparable period of 2022. This reflects lower gross deposits due to reduced customer activity in the current macro-economic environment  as well as an industry-wide reduction of transfers from defined benefit to defined contribution pensions. Net outflows in Traditional products amounted to GBP 264 million  as this book gradually runs off. For the Institutional business  net deposits improved significantly to GBP 2.8 billion  driven by the onboarding of a large client. The Institutional business is low-margin and net deposits for this business can be lumpy. Annualized revenues gained / (lost) on net deposits Annualized revenues lost on net deposits amounted to GBP 3 million for the quarter  predominantly due to the gradual run-off of the traditional product portfolio  partially offset by revenues gained on net deposits in the Workplace channel. Platform expenses as a percentage of assets under administration Platform expenses as a percentage of assets under administration (AuA) amounted to 23 basis points in the first quarter of 2023  and rose compared with the same period of 2022. This was mostly driven by the impact from unfavorable market movements on assets under administration. 1Q 2023 Trading update - 6 The Hague - May 17  2023 Business update Asset Management Asset Management unaudited Business update EUR millions Notes 1Q 2023 1Q 2022 % General Account (935) (2 664) 65 Affiliate 483 (1 051) n.m.

Below is an overview of recent strategic developments and an update on business performance. Strategic developments On April 26  2023  Aegon AM reached an agreement to buy NIBC Bank's North Westerly European Collateralized Loan Obligation (CLO) management activities. The transaction will see Aegon AM acquire NIBC's UK-based team and CLO platform consisting of three CLOs with assets under management of circa EUR 1.2 billion. The move allows Aegon AM to accelerate its ambitions  with the aim of becoming a leader in the European CLO market next to its successful and growing US CLO franchise. The transaction is expected to be closed in June 2023. On April 27  2023  Aegon AM entered into a strategic partnership with Lakemore Partners to drive the growth of its US CLO platform. Lakemore will provide equity for the issuance of multiple CLOs in the coming years and in return will gain preferred access to Aegon AM's pipeline of new issue CLO transactions. Business update Net deposits Third-party net outflows on the Global Platforms amounted to EUR 0.4 billion in the first quarter of 2023 as net deposits into the Dutch mortgage fund were more than offset by outflows in fiduciary management and in other asset classes. This was in part driven by customers reducing their positions due to adverse developments in the banking industry in March 2023. Third-party net outflows in Strategic Partnerships amounted to EUR 1.3 billion in the first quarter of 2023  and largely occurred in the Chinese asset management joint venture Aegon-Industrial Fund Management Company (AIFMC). This was driven by weak investor sentiment in China and low demand for new funds launched during the quarter. Net deposits from affiliates totaled EUR 0.5 billion in the first quarter of 2023 mostly in US fixed-income products  which is in line with the strategy to increase penetration of Aegon funds in this channel. 1Q 2023 Trading update - 7 The Hague - May 17  2023 Net outflows from the general account were EUR 0.9 billion in the first quarter of 2023  compared with net outflows of EUR 2.7 billion in the prior year period. Annualized revenues gained / (lost) on net deposits Annualized revenues gained on net deposits for Global Platforms amounted to EUR 1 million for the quarter  as net deposits from affiliates and favorable mix effects on gross deposits and outflows in the general account business more than offset revenues lost as a result of third-party net outflows. Assets under management Assets under management decreased by EUR 92 billion compared with March 31  2022  to EUR 296 billion on March 31  2023. This was mainly driven by unfavorable market movements and a transfer of EUR 49 billion assets under management following the completion of the divestment of LBPAM's 45% stake in Ostrum AM. 1Q 2023 Trading update - 8 The Hague - May 17  2023 Business update International International unaudited Business update EUR millions Notes 1Q 2023 1Q 2022 % Spain & Portugal 12 15 (19) China 46 30 52 Brazil 23 19 23 TLB and others 5 - n.m.

Transamerica Life Bermuda (TLB) is classified as a Financial Asset  for which Aegon is maximizing its value through active in-force management  disciplined risk management  and capital management actions. Its closed block of universal life insurance liabilities is reinsured with Transamerica. Below is an overview of recent strategic developments and an update on business performance. Strategic developments In the first quarter of 2023  Aegon agreed to sell the Japanese and Hong Kong operations of Aegon Insights  its direct-marketing business that has been in run-off since 2017. The transaction is in line with Aegon's bias to exit from businesses that are sub-scale  or those that are active in small or niche markets. The sale of the Hong Kong operations was closed in the first quarter  and the sale of the Japanese operations is expected to close before the end of the third quarter of 2023. The transaction will not have a material financial impact on Aegon's capital position nor its financial results. Business update New life sales New life sales increased by 34% compared with the first quarter of 2022 to EUR 86 million. · New life sales in Spain & Portugal decreased by 19% to EUR 12 million due to the divestment of Aegon's stake in the joint venture with Liberbank  and reduced demand for mortgage-linked life sales. · New life sales in China increased by 52% to EUR 46 million driven by the bancassurance channel following the relaxation of the country's COVID-19 measures. · For Brazil  new life sales increased by EUR 4 million to EUR 23 million. The impacts from business growth and increased business ownership were partly offset by lower credit-linked life sales. · For TLB and others  new life sales remained muted at EUR 5 million  and mostly consisted of sales of indexed universal life products in Singapore. New premium production for non-life business New premium production for accident & health insurance amounted to EUR 15 million  an increase of 83% compared with the first quarter of 2022  driven by business growth in Spain & Portugal. New premium production for property & casualty insurance decreased by 26% to EUR 18 million driven by Spain & Portugal. There was less demand for lower margin funeral products  while higher interest rates led to lower demand for mortgages resulting in fewer household policies being sold. 1Q 2023 Trading update - 9 The Hague - May 17  2023 Capital position Aegon N.V. unaudited Main capital ratios 2022 2022 2022 2022 2023 in millions Notes Mar. 31 Jun. 30 Sep. 30 Dec. 31 Mar. 31 United States (USD) Available capital 8 628 8 099 7 727 7 984 8 183 Required capital 2 036 1 946 1 911 1 877 1 875 US RBC ratio 424% 416% 404% 425% 436% Scottish Equitable plc (UK) (GBP) Own funds 2 228 2 060 2 052 1 993 2 037 SCR 1 262 1 160 1 146 1 182 1 188 UK SE Solvency II ratio 177% 178% 179% 169% 171% NL Life (EUR) Own funds 5 214 5 264 4 970 4 627 4 576 SCR 2 800 2 637 2 399 2 205 2 398 NL Life Solvency II ratio 186% 200% 207% 210% 191% Aegon N.V.

From 4Q 2022 onwards the gross remittances from Aegon the Netherlands to group are not recognized in Cash capital at Holding. Maintaining a strong balance sheet is a prerequisite for Aegon to achieve its financial and strategic objectives. It allows the company to build leading  advantaged businesses in its core and growth markets that create value for its customers  shareholders  and other stakeholders. Aegon has a clear capital management framework in place that informs its capital deployment decisions. This framework is based on maintaining an adequate capitalization of its business units  Cash Capital at Holding  and gross financial leverage. Capital ratios US RBC ratio The estimated RBC ratio in the United States increased from 425% on December 31  2022  to 436% on March 31  2023  and remains above the operating level of 400%. There was a positive impact from market movements and one-time items  the latter mainly reflecting a tax benefit. Operating capital generation contributed favorably to the US RBC ratio  and more than offset dividends from the operating companies to the intermediate holding company. UK Solvency II ratio The estimated Solvency II ratio for Scottish Equitable Plc increased from 169% on December 31  2022  to 171% on March 31  2023  and remained above the operating level of 150%. The increase in the ratio reflected a positive contribution from operating capital generation and some smaller one-time items  which more than offset a negative impact from market movements. NL Life Solvency II ratio The estimated Solvency II ratio of NL Life decreased from 210% on December 31  2022  to 191% on March 31  2023  and remains above the operating level of 150%. The decrease reflects a negative impact from refinements of the internal model. Market movements also had a negative impact  mainly through lower real estate valuations and spread movements. Operating capital generation more than offset the EUR 75 million remittance to the intermediate holding company in the first quarter. 1Q 2023 Trading update - 11 The Hague - May 17  2023 Group Solvency II ratio Aegon's Group Solvency II ratio increased from 208% to 210% during the first quarter of 2023  driven by operating capital generation after holding and funding expenses of EUR 227 million  as well as an increase of diversification benefits. Market movements had a total unfavorable impact of EUR 224 million  and notably included the impact of lower real estate valuations in the Netherlands. One-time items amounted to a gain of EUR 61 million. As previously announced  the results of Aegon's Dutch business are reported as one-time items beginning in 2023. Operating capital generation Operating capital generation for Aegon amounted to EUR 227 million after holding funding and operating expenses  compared with EUR 211 million in the first quarter of last year. Earnings on in-force amounted to EUR 290 million  an increase of 22% compared with the first quarter of 2022. This was driven by the United States  and reflects improved claims experience  reduced expenses  and growth of Strategic Assets. Release of required capital increased by 9% compared with the comparable quarter of 2022 to EUR 162 million  and reflects the repayment of a short-term loan in the United States in the first quarter of 2023. New business strain amounted to EUR 225 million  representing an increase of EUR 50 million compared with the first quarter last year. This mostly relates to the Americas  and is in line with the company's aim of driving profitable growth in the US Strategic Assets. Holding funding and operating expenses amounted to EUR 65 million  which is a decrease of EUR 2 million. Cash Capital at Holding and free cash flow Aegon's Cash Capital at the Holding decreased from EUR 1 614 million to EUR 1 449 million during the first quarter of 2023. Free cash flow amounted to EUR 47 million  driven by remittances from Asset Management's Strategic Partnership in China. Capital injections of EUR 44 million mostly related to Aegon's business in India. Capital return to shareholders of EUR 109 million reflects the repurchase of shares related to the ongoing EUR 200 million share buyback program that was announced on February 9  2023. Other items totaled EUR 60 million and were driven by the previously announced EUR 43 million share buyback in the context of variable compensation plans. 1Q 2023 Trading update - 12 The Hague - May 17  2023 Additional information Presentation The conference call presentation is available on aegon.com as of 7.00 a.m. CET.

(Epizyme). Pursuant to the transaction  Ipsen acquires all outstanding shares of Epizyme for $1.45 per share plus a contingent value right (CVR) of $1.00 per share. Epizyme now operates as ‘an Ipsen company’ at deal close.As part of the transaction  Ipsen acquires Epizyme’s lead medicine  Tazverik® (tazemetostat)  a first-in-class  chemotherapy-free EZH2a inhibitor  which was granted Accelerated Approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2020. It is currently indicated for adults with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) whose tumors are positive for an EZH2 mutation as detected by an FDA-approved test and who have received at least two prior systemic therapies  and for adult patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options  as well as for adults and pediatric patients aged 16 years and older with metastatic or locally advanced epithelioid sarcoma not eligible for complete resection.1Ipsen also acquires Epizyme’s first-in-class  oral SETD2 inhibitor development candidate  EZM0414  which was granted FDA Fast Track status in 2021 and is currently under evaluation in a recently initiated Phase I/Ib trial in adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma  as well as a portfolio of preclinical programs focusing on epigenetic targets.“Throughout the pre-close phase of planning  we have continued to be impressed by the potential of Tazverik  as well as the rest of the pipeline. Now that the deal is closed  we are excited to be working closely with our Epizyme colleagues to leverage Ipsen’s established infrastructure so that these medicines may reach more patients. Additionally  through this transaction Ipsen gains scientific expertise and we look forward to integrating the two teams which share the goal of delivering innovative treatment options to underserved patients ” said David Loew  Chief Executive Officer of Ipsen.Story continuesAbout Tazverik® (tazemetostat)Tazverik is a methyltransferase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of:Adults and pediatric patients aged 16 years and older with metastatic or locally advanced epithelioid sarcoma not eligible for complete resection.Adult patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma whose tumors are positive for an EZH2 mutation as detected by an FDA-approved test and who have received at least two prior systemic therapies.Adult patients with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options.These indications are approved under accelerated approval based on overall response rate and duration of response. Post marketing studies are required to confirm the anticipated clinical benefit and retain the labeled Accelerated Approval indications.The most common (≥20%) adverse reactions in patients with epithelioid sarcoma are pain  fatigue  nausea  decreased appetite  vomiting and constipation. The most common (≥20%) adverse reactions in patients with follicular lymphoma are fatigue  upper respiratory tract infection  musculoskeletal pain  nausea and abdominal pain.View the U.S. Full Prescribing Information here: https://www.epizyme.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/TAZVERIK.pdfAbout EZM0414EZM0414 is a potent selective  oral  small molecule  investigational drug agent that inhibits the histone methyltransferase  SETD2  which plays a role in oncogenesis. SETD2 methylates histone as well as non-histone proteins  and this activity is involved in several key biological processes including transcriptional regulation  RNA splicing  and DNA damage repair. Based on the preclinical data on SETD2 inhibition by EZM0414 in multiple settings  including high risk t(4;14) multiple myeloma (MM) and in other B-cell malignancies such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)  the Company is conducting SET-101  a Phase 1/1b study of EZM0414  for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory MM and DLBCL.About follicular lymphoma2  3Follicular lymphoma is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) which is a cancer of the lymphatic system. Follicular lymphoma develops when the body makes abnormal B lymphocytes. These lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell that normally helps fight infections. When a patient has a lymphoma  the abnormal lymphocytes build up in the lymph nodes or other body organs. Follicular lymphoma is generally slow growing. Each year  15-20 000 people in the U.S. are diagnosed with follicular lymphoma. Most affected individuals are diagnosed with advanced disease.About epithelioid sarcoma4Epithelioid sarcoma is a rare  slow-growing type of soft tissue cancer. Most cases begin in the soft tissue under the skin of a finger  hand  forearm  lower leg or foot  though it can start in other areas of the body. Typically  epithelioid sarcoma starts as a small firm growth or lump that is painless. It usually starts out as a single growth  but multiple growths may occur by the time a person seeks medical help. Sometimes this sarcoma appears as ulcers that don’t heal  looking like open wounds over the growths. It is estimated that 13 040 individuals received a diagnosis of soft tissue sarcomas in the U.S. in 2018 with a corresponding 5 150 deaths.5About diffuse large B-cell lymphoma6Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a type of NHL. NHL is a cancer of the lymphatic system. It develops when the body makes abnormal B lymphocytes. These lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell that normally help to fight infections. When a patient has a lymphoma  the abnormal lymphocytes build up in lymph nodes or other body organs. DLBCL grows quickly and treatment starts soon after diagnosis. DLBCL is the most common type of NHL in the U.S. and worldwide  accounting for about 22 percent of newly diagnosed cases of B-cell NHL in the U.S. More than 18 000 people in the U.S. are diagnosed with DLBCL each year.7About multiple myeloma8Multiple myeloma is a rare form of cancer characterized by excessive production (proliferation) and improper function of certain cells (plasma cells) found in the bone marrow. Excessive plasma cells may eventually mass together to form a tumor or tumors in various sites of the body  especially the bone marrow. When multiple tumors are present or the bone marrow has greater than 10% plasma cells  the term multiple myeloma is used. In 2019  over 32 000 individuals in the U.S. were diagnosed with this disease. It is believed that approximately 100 000 Americans currently have the disease.About IpsenIpsen is a global  mid-sized biopharmaceutical company focused on transformative medicines in Oncology  Rare Disease and Neuroscience.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law. Ipsen’s business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers.
