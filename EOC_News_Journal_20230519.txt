When three nerdy Deusto students decided to set up a company to experiment with an industry  the virtual reality industry at the dawn of the Digital Age  we never imagined that  almost 20 years later  we would be a listed multinational.The opening bell at Euronext Access Paris rang  not only as a signal of our entry into the stock market  but also as a symbol of almost two decades of dedication and unwavering commitment to industrial virtual reality.Not many virtual reality companies have reached where we have. Our journey has not been easy but our determination to turn our passion into a way of life has allowed us to get this far and to do so by bringing together a large group of Virtual Reality technology enthusiasts to our business project.Our IPO was the result of a year and a half of meticulous preparation. Going public is not a step taken lightly. It is the reflection of 19 years of tireless work  from our founding in 2004 to becoming one of the European leaders in the virtual reality industry. The kind that builds projects and deploys technologies that could be game changers. In key sectors  in critical infrastructures  in the energy  mobility and education industries. We dream of a better world where VR is the vehicle to reach more places  to new heights  from more places.But beyond the corporate paraphernalia  the bell and the trading desks  those of you who know us know that our IPO was an exciting time for us.Euronext  the pan-European stock exchange that brings together the Paris  Amsterdam  Brussels  Oslo  Milan and Dublin stock exchanges  represents a stage of growth and international expansion for Virtualware. Our inclusion in the Access segment of Euronext is a recognition of our efforts and the trust placed in us by our partners and customers.In just one month of trading  our stock market valuation has grown by more than 40 percent. And that means the market believes in us. At least for the time being. What happens in the future depends on the work we do. What we do together.We already are more than 70 shareholders  including 42 shareholders of the company. And we expect to continue to grow.As a pioneer in the European virtual reality industry  we have maintained a deep commitment to developing immersive solutions for the industrial world.Our team of more than 50 people has developed over 500 projects in more than 33 countries. We work with renowned multinationals and institutions such as GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy  Ontario Power Generation  Petronas  Iberdrola  Alstom  Guardian Glass  Gestamp  Danone  Johnson & Johnson  Biogen  Bayer  ADIF  the Spanish Ministry of Defence  McMaster University  El Retoño Technical University and EAN University  to name but a few.Our flagship product  VIROO  the pioneering Virtual Reality as a Service (VRaaS) platform  is already being used by companies on three continents and has been used to develop strategic projects for defence ministries  critical infrastructure training projects and innovative educational programmes. VIROO aims to become the standard for the development of industrial and educational Virtual Reality applications worldwide.This milestone has not been easy to achieve. Over the years  we have faced challenges and overcome obstacles  but our dedication  innovation and commitment to our values have always allowed us to move forward.Today  Virtualware is in a stronger position than ever  with a growing international presence and a team that has not been lulled by empty words and siren songs ending in the word ""metaverse"". Let's hope we can make Neal Stephenson's literature fans proud.Virtual reality is more than a trend  it is a tool that has the power to transform industries and improve lives. Device development will dictate the speed at which the industry evolves  but for now we are working with the automotive industry in WindsorEssex and Detroit to recapture the value of technologies that  like CAVEs  had lost value.At Virtualware  we have always believed in this power  and have dedicated our efforts to unlocking its potential. While ""metaverse"" has become a buzzword in the technology industry  we have chosen to focus on virtual reality for industry. This approach has allowed us to avoid the noise and concentrate on developing and deploying technologies that bring real value to our customers.For those of you who want to join Virtualware as an investor we have created a website called ir.virtualwareco.com. Our email ir@virtualwareco.com is open day and night to solve your doubts (warning: we answer in the morning  Bilbao time). And from now on  we promise to be as transparent as possible in telling you about the good moments (and the not-so-good circumstances) that happen on our way.Next week  on 25 May  we will hold our first town hall with investors. It will be online  at the link (and it will be in Spanish). We sincerely hope you can join us.Thank you for being part of this exciting chapter in Virtualware's history. Together  we will continue to transform industries and make a difference.With our sincere thanks Unai Extremo  CEO Sergio Barrera  CTO Virtualware051823unaiextremosergiobarreraonemonthcommitmentandevolution.pdf",neutral,0.06,0.94,0.0,mixed,0.45,0.1,0.45,True,English,"['Euronext Access Paris', 'Letter', 'CEO', 'Commitment', 'Evolution', '30 days', 'company', 'El Retoño Technical University', 'three nerdy Deusto students', 'GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy', 'educational Virtual Reality applications', 'Virtual Reality technology enthusiasts', 'critical infrastructure training projects', 'many virtual reality companies', 'European virtual reality industry', 'innovative educational programmes', 'pioneering Virtual Reality', 'first town hall', 'pan-European stock exchange', 'Dublin stock exchanges', 'growing international presence', 'industrial virtual reality', 'stock market valuation', 'Ontario Power Generation', 'Euronext Access Paris', 'technology industry', 'European leaders', 'critical infrastructures', 'McMaster University', 'EAN University', 'three continents', 'Access segment', 'international expansion', 'automotive industry', 'new chapter', 'Digital Age', 'two decades', 'large group', 'business project', 'meticulous preparation', 'game changers', 'key sectors', 'new heights', 'corporate paraphernalia', 'immersive solutions', 'renowned multinationals', 'Guardian Glass', 'Spanish Ministry', 'flagship product', 'VRaaS) platform', 'strategic projects', 'stronger position', 'empty words', 'siren songs', 'Neal Stephenson', 'literature fans', 'good moments', 'good circumstances', 'exciting time', 'Bilbao time', 'opening bell', 'unwavering commitment', 'tireless work', 'education industries', 'trading desks', 'one month', 'deep commitment', 'industrial world', 'defence ministries', 'Device development', 'real value', '500 projects', 'Letter', 'CEO', 'Evolution', '30 days', 'company', '20 April', 'beginning', 'Virtualware', 'history', 'dawn', 'signal', 'entry', 'symbol', 'dedication', 'journey', 'determination', 'passion', 'way', 'life', 'IPO', 'result', 'year', 'half', 'public', 'reflection', 'founding', 'kind', 'technologies', 'mobility', 'vehicle', 'places', 'Amsterdam', 'Brussels', 'Oslo', 'Milan', 'stage', 'growth', 'inclusion', 'recognition', 'efforts', 'trust', 'partners', 'customers', '40 percent', 'future', '70 shareholders', '42 shareholders', 'team', '50 people', '33 countries', 'institutions', 'Petronas', 'Iberdrola', 'Alstom', 'Gestamp', 'Danone', 'Johnson', 'Biogen', 'Bayer', 'ADIF', 'VIROO', 'Service', 'standard', 'milestone', 'challenges', 'obstacles', 'innovation', 'values', 'trend', 'tool', 'lives', 'speed', 'WindsorEssex', 'Detroit', 'CAVEs', 'potential', 'metaverse', 'buzzword', 'approach', 'noise', 'investor', 'website', 'email', 'doubts', 'morning', '25 May', 'link']",2023-05-18,2023-05-19,marketscreener.com

The decision unanimously affirms the United States Federal Circuit Court's opinion that is favorable to Sanofi and Regeneron.This ruling reinforces our longstanding belief that Amgen's asserted patent claims are invalid and represents an unequivocal win for America's innovation economy  its scientists  and researchers. Most importantly  it is a win for patients who rely on the lifesaving discoveries made through years of research and investment by the biopharma community.

Interconnectors are power cables connecting different countries' electricity grids  as a means of improving grid efficiency and expediting the transmission of energy internationally from where it is generated to where it is needed. As the world transitions to a NetZero future  and with recent stark reminders of the importance of energy security  interconnectors are recognised as a central component to countries' energy strategies because interconnected grids are more efficient and able to respond to market stress.The nucleus of this platform is Global InterConnection Group SA's existing holdings in Advanced Cables and Atlantic SuperConnection  which will be supported by a design  planning and operations division (to be named GIG Services). Advanced Cables is developing a 1 500+ km/year capacity HVDC cable manufacturing facility in the North East of England; a testing and research centre; and an aluminium stranding factory in Iceland ; while Atlantic SuperConnection is developing a 1.8GW interconnector between Iceland and the UK.Further details are available at www.globalinterconnectiongroup.com .History of DCACDCAC is a special purpose acquisition company (“SPAC”) incorporated on 29 April 2021 under the Companies Law as a non-cellular company limited by shares.DCAC's leadership team comprises executive director: Edmund Truell (Chief Executive Officer); non-executive directors: Jennie Younger (Non-Executive Director)  Luke Webster (Non-Executive Director)  and Roger Le Tissier (Non-Executive Director); and special advisers: Dimitri Goulandris and Kari Stadigh.The DCAC Ordinary Shares and DCAC Warrants are currently separately listed and traded on Euronext Amsterdam under the ISIN GG00BMB5XZ39 and symbol DCACS for the DCAC Ordinary Shares and ISIN GG00BMB5XY22 and symbol DCACW for the DCAC Warrants.A copy of the press release is available on the DCAC website (www.disruptivecapitalac.com).PRESS AND INVESTOR INFORMATIONFor more information  please contact:Company enquiries to:disruptive@admina.ggRegistered officeFirst Floor  10 Lefebvre StreetSt Peter PortGuernsey GY1 2PEMedia inquiries to:",neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.16,0.04,0.8,True,English,"['DCAC Ordinary Shareholder Class Meeting', 'DCAC Sponsor Shareholder Class Meeting', 'DCAC Warrant Holder Meeting', 'results', 'EGM', '18 May', '1,500+ km/year capacity HVDC cable manufacturing facility', 'DISRUPTIVE CAPITAL ACQUISITION COMPANY LIMITED', 'Global InterConnection Group SA Background', 'DCAC Ordinary Shareholder Class Meeting results', 'DCAC Sponsor Shareholder Class Meeting', 'DCAC Warrant Holder Meeting results', 'DCAC Sponsor Class Meeting results', 'High Voltage Direct Current', 'EU MARKET ABUSE REGULATION', ""different countries' electricity grids"", 'special purpose acquisition company', 'HVDC"") cable manufacturing', 'DCAC Public Warrant Holders', 'other power transmission projects', 'Warrant Class Meeting', 'extraordinary general meeting', 'DCAC Sponsor Shareholders', 'three interlocking divisions', 'recent stark reminders', 'aluminium stranding factory', 'APPLICABLE SECURITIES LAWS', 'Chief Executive Offi', 'DCAC Ordinary Shareholders', 'Business Combination Arrangements', 'Class Meetings', 'DCAC Shareholders', 'power cables', 'market stress', 'non-cellular company', 'DCAC Warrants', 'Ordinary Resolution', 'Special Resolution', 'OTHER JURISDICTION', 'RELEVANT LAWS', 'executive director', 'interconnected grids', 'UNITED STATES', 'SOUTH AFRICA', 'ISIN Code', 'Further updates', 'ancillary steps', 'due course', 'grid upgrades', 'interconnector assets', 'ancillary services', 'operational management', 'grid efficiency', 'NetZero future', 'central component', 'existing holdings', 'Advanced Cables', 'Atlantic SuperConnection', 'operations division', 'North East', 'research centre', '1.8GW interconnector', 'Further details', 'Companies Law', 'leadership team', 'Edmund Truell', 'PRESS RELEASE', 'energy security', 'energy strategies', 'INSIDE INFORMATION', 'DISTRIBUTION', 'AUSTRALIA', 'CANADA', 'JAPAN', 'VIOLATION', 'REGULATIONS', 'FAILURE', 'RESTRICTIONS', 'QUALIFIES', 'MEANING', 'respect', 'EGM', '18 May', 'votes', 'nil', 'resolutions', 'timing', 'completion', 'means', 'platform', 'development', 'ownership', 'interconnectors', 'commissioning', 'design', 'planning', 'world', 'importance', 'nucleus', 'England', 'testing', 'Iceland', 'UK', 'globalinterconnectiongroup', 'History', 'SPAC', '29 April', 'shares']",2023-05-18,2023-05-19,marketscreener.com

Great Western explores for  appraises and develops mineral resources on its claims in the state of Nevada  USA and currently has no revenues from its operations. Accordingly  it is reporting a loss for the financial year of €792 293 for 2022 (2021: €535 960). At the end of the year Great Western's net current assets were €8 618 024 (2021: €8 945 631) with no debt apart from trade creditors in the normal course of business. 2022 was an active year for Great Western during which significant goals were accomplished. Early in the year we constructed a 14 km road to the high-altitude Mineral Jackpot Group of properties  enabling access for rigs  trucks and associated equipment. Until then  access to the five historic gold and silver mines which make up Mineral Jackpot had been by a mule path  suitable only for quad bikes and very small tracked- vehicles. This road now provides access to numerous spoil heaps which we propose to exploit for secondary recovery of precious metals and it also allowed us to bring in a rig and drill four holes last summer  the first ever drilled in these historic mines. Significantly  hole MJRC004 intercepted high grades of silver at a shallow depth and further drilling is planned to delineate a shallow vein which  if successful  could provide ore suitable for processing in a relatively short time. During the year  our plans for constructing a mill to produce gold and silver concentrates took a major step forward when we signed a 50-50 joint venture agreement with Muletown Enterprizes LLC (""Muletown"") to construct a mill on land owned by Muletown in the settlement of Mina  close to a main highway and mid-way between our two main claim areas. There has been a mill on this site in the past and it has a natural slope which is ideal for gravity separation. A second phase will involve a contained chemical leaching process for further recovery of gold and silver. Muletown will provide the land at a peppercorn rent and virtually all the milling equipment will come from its own inventory. Great Western will fund site construction  upgrade and modification of equipment and installation and commissioning of the plant. The mill will operate as a profit centre in its own right and each partner will batch-process its own material with no commingling  paying a throughput charge to the joint venture. Great Western has spoil material for processing available at Mineral Jackpot and Olympic Gold  as well as significant tailings and a large unprocessed stockpile at Olympic Gold. It is likely that the joint venture will subsequently buy in material from third parties as there is no other mill of this type serving the area. Part of the new capital raised by the Company since the year end is being used for construction of the mill  delayed by severe weather conditions and an extended winter but now under way. Before the year-end  our work on processing gold and silver from tailings and spoil heaps was further supported by a JORC-compliant inferred resource report  commissioned for the OMCO Mine tailings  together with Exploration Targets for other material at both Olympic Gold and at Mineral Jackpot  further details of which are set out in the Operations Report on page 6. During spring and summer 2022  we conducted a reverse circulation (""RC"") drill programme on several of our prospects. In addition to success at Mineral Jackpot  we carried out follow-up drilling at Rock House (Southern Alteration Zone)  Trafalgar Hill and the OMCO Mine (the latter two both at Olympic Gold). At Trafalgar Hill and Rock House  we were attempting to establish vein continuity from the gold intercepts encountered in 2021 but we have yet to achieve this and more work is needed. Our drilling close to the OMCO Mine was much more successful and we believe that we have encountered an extension to the OMCO Mine vein itself which is an exciting development. The OMCO Mine produced gold at high grades for several decades until the 1940s and operations terminated where the vein met a fault. Although the fault is clearly present  it is a complex piece of fragmented geology and finding a continuation of the vein  on either side of the fault  presents a challenge which we are working hard to overcome. In this regard the successful hole drilled last year may be considered a breakthrough. While the OMCO Mine produced gold at high grades  the mined vein itself is only about 200 metres long. Within the envelope we have been drilling  there is easily scope for one or two more productive veins of that size and our task is to find them if they exist. Due to Nevada winter conditions  there is a close period when operations are not feasible. At Great Western  we use this winter period for desktop work and over the past winter we greatly increased our knowledge  not only for gold and silver but also for the prospectivity of our copper assets which have been parked over the last three years but not forgotten. Since the year-end  we have (1) raised new capital of £800 000 (€913 242) before expenses  our first funding for nearly two years (2) drilled a diamond core follow-up hole at the OMCO Mine prospect (3) filed a final permit application for the construction of the processing mill with the Nevada Department of Environmental Protection (NDEP) after prior consultation with NDEP on the critical issues and (4) began construction at the mill site. For our reported 2022 financial statements  we are pleased to welcome PKF O'Connor  Leddy & Holmes Limited as auditors to the company  who replace KPMG. PKF's appointment will be put to shareholders for approval at the forthcoming AGM. We have enjoyed excellent working relations with KPMG over several years and I would like to take this opportunity to thank them for their services. Looking ahead  Great Western has three arms to its business: Firstly  the process mill which is due to be online in 2023 and producing the Company's first ever revenues from the sale of gold and silver concentrates. This will be an ongoing business which should also attract material for processing from third party sources in due course. Until we have commissioned the plant and gained some operating experience  we do not propose to publish any revenue forecasts  but the objective of the mill is to provide revenues which  at a first stage  will fund the day-to-day operations of the company  while aiming for a greatly expanded business model. Each joint venture partner will have its own material batch-processed separately through the mill  so participation in the joint venture will not result in any dilution in ownership of material from the Company's own claims. Secondly  we are aiming to develop a commercial gold and silver play from one or more of the numerous prospects which we have identified and drilled up in the last few work seasons. The leading candidates are (1) extensions to the vein at the OMCO Mine and (2) the shallow silver intercept encountered at Mineral Jackpot. We are also exploring other gold and silver prospects  with ongoing work at Trafalgar Hill and Rock House  so priorities may change. Finally  recent modelling work by the Company indicates that we may have a significant copper prospect on our claims beyond our JORC-compliant indicated and inferred resource. Through extensive drilling  we have already established a resource of 4.28 million tonnes at a grade of 0.45% copper on our M2 claims in the Black Mountains group. This discovery trends in a NE-SW axis  open at both ends  but there is also scope for an additional  undrilled resource within the area of resources already identified. Copper is likely to become a significant industrial material in the years ahead and our copper prospects merit further drilling. Establishing a resource two to three or four times larger than already identified would  on a rule of thumb basis  be large enough for a commercial development but doing justice to this prospect will require funding beyond Great Western's current capabilities. Therefore  funding options comprising the introduction of a joint venture partner  be it a direct investor at the project level or an industry partner  are being actively evaluated. Shareholders should note that Canada's highly reputed Fraser Institute has recently published the results of a worldwide industry survey which concludes that the state of Nevada is the most attractive jurisdiction in the world for mining investment. In closing  on behalf of the Great Western team  I would like to thank you  our shareholders  for your support and particularly those shareholders who have been taking an active interest in our projects. We will keep you informed on progress and hope to welcome you to the AGM in Dublin at 10 a.m. on 13 June 2023. Yours sincerely  Brian Hall Executive Chairman Operations Report For the year ended 31 December 2022 Principal activities  strategy and business model The principal activity of Great Western is to explore for and develop gold  silver  copper and other minerals. The Board aims to increase shareholder value by the systematic evaluation and exploitation of its existing assets in Mineral County  Nevada  USA and elsewhere as may become applicable. Great Western's near-term objective is to develop small-scale  short lead-time gold and silver projects which can potentially be brought into production under the control of the Group. These projects include both in situ mineralisation and waste reprocessing opportunities. Great Western has entered into a joint venture with a local partner to enable near-term production. The Group is also focused on progressing the copper projects which it has already identified and enhanced through extensive drilling. Such projects have potential for the discovery of large mineralised systems which can be monetised over the longer term  possibly through joint ventures with third parties. Business development and performance During the twelve months ended 31 December 2022  Great Western carried out exploration across its entire portfolio of seven claim groups (six of which are 100% owned  one of which is held under an option agreement) in Nevada. As part of the annual claim renewal procedure  the Group renewed all its claims with effect from 1 September 2022. Following renewal  the land position held by Great Western in Mineral County consists of 741 full and fractional unpatented claims  covering a total land area of approximately 61km². Review by Claim Group Olympic In 2020  the Company acquired an option to purchase the Olympic Gold Project  a group of 48 claims  located approximately 50 miles from Great Western's original concessions but still within Mineral County. The purchase consideration of $150 000 is spread over four years during which time Great Western has full rights to all data and to conduct exploration and appraisal work. Great Western may elect to bring forward the closing of the purchase by early-paying the schedule in full or it may exit the project at any time without penalty and without completing the payment schedule. Work is in progress on several potential prospects over this 800-acre site. The Olympic Gold Project lies on the northern flanks of the Cedar Mountain Range  on the eastern edge of Mineral County. It lies within the Walker Lane Fault Belt  at the intersection of two major mineral trends - the Rawhide-Paradise Peak trend and the Aurora-Round Mountain Trend. The mineral deposit style at Olympic is low-sulphidation epithermal banded quartz-gold vein. Historic production from the former Olympic Gold Mine totalled approximately 35 000 tonnes  at a grade of 25 grams/ton gold and 30 grams/ton silver  in the interwar period of 1918 to 1939. Based on its review of the historical data  Great Western believes that faulted offsets of the high-grade Olympic Vein remain to be discovered in the area and this forms one of the numerous target zones on the prospect. During 2022 several targets at Olympic were addressed with reverse circulation (""RC"") drilling near to the OMCO mine site and at the Trafalgar Hill prospect. In addition to the drilling  a drone orthophotography survey was flown to produce a precise digital topographic model  and bulk surface and auger samples were taken from various mine waste stores at the OMCO mine site. Drilling around the OMCO mine site was focused on possible unmined continuations of the vein on the west side of the fault. This proved successful  as hole OMRC015 intercepted compatible vein material  proving up a continuation of the OMCO vein. OMCR0015 intercepted 6.10 metres grading at 2.682 grams/ton Au average starting at 38.10 metres in the hole  including 8.110 grams/ton Au over 1.52 metres from 39.62 metres and 1.747 grams/ton Au over 1.52 metres from 41.15 metres. Pursuing this vein will be a primary objective of the next drill campaign.

May 18  2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Sanofi (NASDAQ: SNY) is pleased with the United States Supreme Court's ruling in Amgen v. Sanofi et. al. The decision unanimously affirms the United States Federal Circuit Court's opinion that is favorable to Sanofi and Regeneron.This ruling reinforces our longstanding belief that Amgen's asserted patent claims are invalid and represents an unequivocal win for America's innovation economy  its scientists  and researchers. Most importantly  it is a win for patients who rely on the lifesaving discoveries made through years of research and investment by the biopharma community. The justices rejected an attempt to radically change the longstanding legal standard for patent validity under the enablement doctrine – a move that would have blocked progress for entire classes of molecules  deterred innovative competition  and led to potential increases of drug prices.We thank the Justices and the many groups  individuals and the U.S. government who supported our defense of scientific innovation.About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people's lives.

Earnings before interest  tax  amortisation and depreciation (EBITDA) grew 26.9% to 82 million euros.Deliberations are preliminary  and a transaction might not materialise  the people cautioned. They come after Fidelidade acquired the remaining 49% of Luz Saude it did not already own from parent Fosun in September.Luz Saude referred comment to Fidelidade  which declined to comment. Fosun did not reply to a request for comment.An IPO would mark a return of Luz Saude to the stock market after the healthcare group stopped trading on Euronext Lisbon in 2018.It could also awaken Europe's IPO market  after activity levels plunged last year on the back of soaring interest rates and economic uncertainty.While dealmaking has slowed across the board amid inflation and macroeconomic fears  healthcare remains one of the most active corners of the market  with $131 billion worth of mergers and acquisitions globally in the first four months of the year  according to Refinitiv Deals Intelligence.($1 = 0.9084 euros)(Reporting by Andres Gonzalez and Pablo Mayo Cerqueiro in London and Sergio Goncalves in Lisbon; editing by Elisa Martinuzzi and Louise Heavens),neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,negative,0.0,0.09,0.91,True,English,"['private hospital unit Luz Saude', 'Exclusive-Fidelidade plans', 'IPO', 'sources', 'potential stock market listing', 'Pablo Mayo Cerqueiro', 'initial public offering', 'first four months', 'Refinitiv Deals Intelligence', 'private healthcare subsidiary', 'private healthcare services', 'soaring interest rates', 'Portuguese insurer Fidelidade', 'healthcare group', 'Andres Gonzalez', 'Sergio Goncalves', 'Luz Saude', 'investment banks', 'insurance group', 'minority stake', 'operating income', 'activity levels', 'economic uncertainty', 'macroeconomic fears', 'active corners', '$131 billion worth', 'Elisa Martinuzzi', 'Louise Heavens', '1 billion euros', '599 million euros', '82 million euros', 'Fosun International', 'parent Fosun', 'IPO market', 'Euronext Lisbon', 'six people', '0.9084 euros', 'LONDON/LISBON', 'Reuters', 'matter', 'China', 'pitches', 'condition', 'anonymity', '30 hospitals', 'clinics', 'Portugal', '10.6% jump', 'year', 'growth', 'Earnings', 'tax', 'amortisation', 'depreciation', 'EBITDA', 'Deliberations', 'transaction', 'September', 'comment', 'request', 'return', 'Europe', 'back', 'dealmaking', 'board', 'inflation', 'mergers', 'acquisitions']",2023-05-19,2023-05-19,uk.sports.yahoo.com

Only three companies have joined Euronext Dublin  as the exchange is now known  over the past four years. Greencore  C&C  Applegreen  Aryzta and Diageo are among the departures. CRH  the biggest company on the exchange  is moving its primary listing to America; and Flutter  owner of Paddy Power  might do the same.If both were to leave  it would cost the exchequer up to €250 million a year in stamp duty. That’s because of a 1 per cent tax on every share purchase.This potential loss is now concentrating minds on Merrion Street. The department said it would not comment on any announcement by Irish issuers as regards their listing intentions. “However  in light of potential impacts on tax receipts and more generally Irish capital markets  officials have been engaging with Euronext Dublin and relevant market participants with a view to better understanding the issues at hand. Officials remain open to continued engagements.”Euronext Dublin declined to comment  but we hear it is preparing a report for the department. What could the Government do to help? Cut the transaction tax to 0.5 per cent  perhaps. Reducing capital gains tax for business founders who sell shares in an IPO might encourage new listings. The last IPO of any consequence in Dublin was Uniphar’s. That was in July 2019.READ MOREGuessing game on Ryanair’s Boeing discountNobody thinks Michael O’Leary is coughing up $133 million per plane.. Photograph: Daniel Leal/AFP via GettyJust how much is Ryanair paying Boeing for its new aircraft? The sticker price for the 300 Max-10s it has ordered is $40 billion (€36.9 billion)  but nobody thinks Michael O’Leary is coughing up $133 million per plane.“I have been told to say there was a competitive discount  although I don’t think [it] was particularly competitive ” O’Leary quipped at the announcement press conference.Aviation analysts have been giving their guesstimates of just how big a discount Ryanair got. Bernstein believes it paid $38 million per plane. Barclays based its calculation on the fact that Ryanair reckons its capital expenditure for 2027 will be above €2 billion annually. “If we assume some €500 million of maintenance capex  this would hypothetically imply a price in excess of $44 million per aircraft ” it said.Morgan Stanley’s hypothesis is much higher. “Based on rough current market values  and assuming a discount of about 5 per cent ... we estimate a purchase price of roughly $57 million ” it said.Many industry watchers await the calculation by Robert Boyle  a former strategy director of IAG. Working from Ryanair’s accounts  he calculated that it paid Boeing $27.1 million per plane in 2005  and €35.8 million in 2013.“I’m sure they didn’t secure the same level of discounts they got in the past ” says Boyle. “That is simply based on the fact that Ryanair really needs the aircraft and there is a shortage of supply in the market. [The price] will definitely be higher.”Given that Ryanair’s plan is to fund the planes from internal cash flows  we will find out eventually.Kelly nets Serena Williams at ConselloSerena Williams retired from tennis last year to “grow” her family and develop the venture capital company she formed in 2017. Photograph: Justin Lane/EPADeclan Kelly has signed up another sports superstar to be a “senior adviser” at Consello  his financial services advisory company. This time it’s Serena Williams  winner of 23 Grand Slam singles tennis titles. She retired from tennis last year to “grow” her family and develop the venture capital company she formed in 2017.Williams joins ex-American footballer Tom Brady and former basketball player Pau Gasol on the advisory board at Consello  which the PR guru from Tipperary launched in 2021.“I have been extremely impressed with the progress Declan and the entire team at Consello have made since the launch ” says Williams in a statement on its website. She add that the team of senior executives Kelly has brought together “is  in my opinion  one of the best in the world already”. Looking forward to “a long and mutually successful partnership” with the company  Williams professes herself “very energised by the opportunities that lie ahead”.Consello says Williams will work with its clients and portfolio companies “on various strategic matters”.Pigsback’s illustrious alumni gather for memoir launchPigsback.com  a discount deals and rewards website  was launched in Dublin’s Grand Canal Dock on a hot day in July 2000  its founder Michael Dwyer recalls in his new book  From the Arena  based on journals he has kept over two decades in business.The colour pink was the theme of the launch  with pink cocktails served to guests  many decked out in pink shirts and dresses. Dwyer’s sister  Geraldine  recruited two on-street promoters from Dundalk  one called Brian  who arrived in pig suits. At one point Brian took off his pig’s head to get a breather  putting it down beside him on a wall. Whereupon a local rascal zoomed up on a bike and grabbed it.“Brian must have felt that the very success of Pigsback was in his hands when  in full pig regalia  he gave chase ” writes Dwyer. The thief was clearly surprised by the speed of the pursuing porcine  since he dropped the head  and Brian brought back the bacon. “Now that’s commitment ” marvels Dwyer.From the Arena  edited by the writer Gavin Daly  was launched at the Cafe du Journal in Monkstown last week. Master of ceremonies was Gareth Lambe  an early Pigsback employee who became head of Meta in Ireland. His successor Anne O’Leary was among the attendees – she  Lambe and Dwyer are neighbours in Monkstown.Also spotted were Cillian Barry  another ex-Pigsbacker  who sold his gaming company SportsCaller business to the American casino corporation Bally’s for €40 million; and Dwyer’s brother John  chairman of Renatus  a private equity firm.RTÉ's Player finally a playerThe RTÉ Player was once called “perhaps the most notorious software ever created in Ireland” and a “glitchy abomination” by a TV critic of this newspaper. Quietly  though  Montrose has sorted it out. Audience numbers are growing  and there are fewer criticisms about the online streaming service stalling  or about the ads looping instead of the programme playing.RTÉ has told me that streams this year are up 20 per cent  at 31.4 million  with time spent viewing up 50 per cent. That follows a successful 2022  with 80 million streams  up 18 per cent on the previous year.Sport accounted for 11.9 million streams last year  including the World Cup in Qatar  and the Republic of Ireland qualifying for the Fifa Women’s World Cup. This year’s rugby Grand Slam naturally proved popular  with 621 000 streams recorded.Box sets are the biggest draw  though  and accounted for 15 million streams last year. Normal People had 1.1 million of those  bringing the total since its release to 7.2 million. With Netflix in decline  might RTÉ’s streaming service finally be a player?Learning from incarcerated Harry CassidyEven though he is now serving a sentence of six years and 10 months for conspiracy to defraud investors  Harry Cassidy is still offering to teach English online. Courses by the former boss of Custom House Capital are being advertised on Udemy for as little as €9.99  including one called The Most Common Mistakes in English and How to Avoid Them. The price represents a steep discount on the original €79.99.Cassidy seems to be better at teaching than he was at investing. His instructor rating on Udemy is 4.5 out of five  based on 969 reviews from the 27 501 students who took his courses.It’s not clear how incarceration will affect Cassidy’s new career. Could he one day become the Andy Dufresne of the Irish prison system?,negative,0.0,0.16,0.83,mixed,0.42,0.13,0.45,True,English,"['Irish stock exchange', 'mandarins’ radar', '23 Grand Slam singles tennis titles', 'ex-American footballer Tom Brady', 'financial services advisory company', 'Grand Canal Dock', 'Many industry watchers', 'former strategy director', 'internal cash flows', 'former basketball player', 'various strategic matters', 'Irish capital markets', 'venture capital company', 'past four years', 'relevant market participants', 'current market values', 'capital gains tax', 'Michael O’Leary', 'announcement press conference', '1 per cent tax', 'Irish Stock Exchange', 'advisory board', 'capital expenditure', '0.5 per cent', 'Irish issuers', 'biggest company', 'tax receipts', 'transaction tax', 'Michael Dwyer', 'three companies', 'close eye', 'existential crisis', 'C&C', 'primary listing', 'Paddy Power', 'stamp duty', 'share purchase', 'potential loss', 'Merrion Street', 'listing intentions', 'potential impacts', 'continued engagements', 'new listings', 'Guessing game', 'Daniel Leal/AFP', 'Aviation analysts', 'maintenance capex', 'Morgan Stanley', 'same level', 'Justin Lane/EPA', 'sports superstar', 'senior adviser', 'Pau Gasol', 'PR guru', 'senior executives', 'successful partnership', 'portfolio companies', 'illustrious alumni', 'hot day', 'new book', 'two decades', 'street promoters', 'pig suits', 'one point', 'Euronext Dublin', 'pink cocktails', 'pink shirts', 'competitive discount', 'discount deals', 'business founders', 'last IPO', 'sticker price', 'purchase price', 'Robert Boyle', 'entire team', 'Pigsback.com', 'rewards website', 'Serena Williams', 'The Department', 'new aircraft', 'memoir launch', 'Boeing discount', 'Declan Kelly', 'Finance', 'Greencore', 'Applegreen', 'Aryzta', 'Diageo', 'departures', 'CRH', 'Flutter', 'owner', 'exchequer', 'minds', 'light', 'officials', 'view', 'issues', 'hand', 'report', 'Government', 'shares', 'consequence', 'Uniphar', 'July', 'READ', 'Ryanair', 'Nobody', 'plane', 'Photograph', 'Getty', '300 Max-10s', 'guesstimates', 'Bernstein', 'Barclays', 'calculation', 'fact', 'excess', 'hypothesis', 'rough', 'accounts', 'discounts', 'shortage', 'supply', 'Consello', 'family', 'winner', 'Tipperary', 'progress', 'statement', 'opinion', 'world', 'long', 'opportunities', 'clients', 'Arena', 'journals', 'colour', 'theme', 'guests', 'dresses', 'sister', 'Geraldine', 'Dundalk', 'Brian']",2023-05-19,2023-05-19,irishtimes.com
