Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law. Ipsen’s business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers.

In addition  Ipsen is also currently in the process of obtaining approvals in other countries outside the European Union.Dysport® is an injectable form of a botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT-A) product  which has previously shown clinically meaningful benefit in the symptomatic treatment of focal spasticity and cervical dystonia.About the CONTENT Phase III programDysport® was assessed in CONTENT  a large  international  Phase III clinical program. The CONTENT1 and CONTENT2 Phase III trials included 485 patients living with NDO and UI who were regularly undergoing CIC and inadequately managed by oral therapy.1Patients recorded the number of UI episodes they experienced per day over a 7-day period in an eDiary at baseline and at weeks 2  6  and 12  and every 12 weeks thereafter. The volume per void during a 24-hour period was also recorded in the eDiary.1About neurogenic detrusor overactivityNeurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO) incontinence is a chronic condition caused by lesions of the central nervous system that result in urinary incontinence (UI).1 2Up to 99% of patients living with MS and up to 84% of patients living with SCI suffer from NDO2 3 and it can cause a substantial impairment to quality of life  social isolation  and embarrassment.4About Dysport®Dysport® (abobotulinumtoxinA) is an injectable form of a botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNT-A) product  which is a substance derived from Clostridium bacteria producing BoNT-A that inhibits the effective transmission of nerve impulses and thereby reduces muscular contractions. It is supplied as a lyophilized powder.

Only three companies have joined Euronext Dublin  as the exchange is now known  over the past four years. Greencore  C&C  Applegreen  Aryzta and Diageo are among the departures. CRH  the biggest company on the exchange  is moving its primary listing to America; and Flutter  owner of Paddy Power  might do the same.If both were to leave  it would cost the exchequer up to €250 million a year in stamp duty. That’s because of a 1 per cent tax on every share purchase.This potential loss is now concentrating minds on Merrion Street. The department said it would not comment on any announcement by Irish issuers as regards their listing intentions. “However  in light of potential impacts on tax receipts and more generally Irish capital markets  officials have been engaging with Euronext Dublin and relevant market participants with a view to better understanding the issues at hand. Officials remain open to continued engagements.”Euronext Dublin declined to comment  but we hear it is preparing a report for the department. What could the Government do to help? Cut the transaction tax to 0.5 per cent  perhaps. Reducing capital gains tax for business founders who sell shares in an IPO might encourage new listings. The last IPO of any consequence in Dublin was Uniphar’s. That was in July 2019.READ MOREGuessing game on Ryanair’s Boeing discountNobody thinks Michael O’Leary is coughing up $133 million per plane.. Photograph: Daniel Leal/AFP via GettyJust how much is Ryanair paying Boeing for its new aircraft? The sticker price for the 300 Max-10s it has ordered is $40 billion (€36.9 billion)  but nobody thinks Michael O’Leary is coughing up $133 million per plane.“I have been told to say there was a competitive discount  although I don’t think [it] was particularly competitive ” O’Leary quipped at the announcement press conference.Aviation analysts have been giving their guesstimates of just how big a discount Ryanair got. Bernstein believes it paid $38 million per plane. Barclays based its calculation on the fact that Ryanair reckons its capital expenditure for 2027 will be above €2 billion annually. “If we assume some €500 million of maintenance capex  this would hypothetically imply a price in excess of $44 million per aircraft ” it said.Morgan Stanley’s hypothesis is much higher. “Based on rough current market values  and assuming a discount of about 5 per cent ... we estimate a purchase price of roughly $57 million ” it said.Many industry watchers await the calculation by Robert Boyle  a former strategy director of IAG. Working from Ryanair’s accounts  he calculated that it paid Boeing $27.1 million per plane in 2005  and €35.8 million in 2013.“I’m sure they didn’t secure the same level of discounts they got in the past ” says Boyle. “That is simply based on the fact that Ryanair really needs the aircraft and there is a shortage of supply in the market. [The price] will definitely be higher.”Given that Ryanair’s plan is to fund the planes from internal cash flows  we will find out eventually.Kelly nets Serena Williams at ConselloSerena Williams retired from tennis last year to “grow” her family and develop the venture capital company she formed in 2017. Photograph: Justin Lane/EPADeclan Kelly has signed up another sports superstar to be a “senior adviser” at Consello  his financial services advisory company. This time it’s Serena Williams  winner of 23 Grand Slam singles tennis titles. She retired from tennis last year to “grow” her family and develop the venture capital company she formed in 2017.Williams joins ex-American footballer Tom Brady and former basketball player Pau Gasol on the advisory board at Consello  which the PR guru from Tipperary launched in 2021.“I have been extremely impressed with the progress Declan and the entire team at Consello have made since the launch ” says Williams in a statement on its website. She add that the team of senior executives Kelly has brought together “is  in my opinion  one of the best in the world already”. Looking forward to “a long and mutually successful partnership” with the company  Williams professes herself “very energised by the opportunities that lie ahead”.Consello says Williams will work with its clients and portfolio companies “on various strategic matters”.Pigsback’s illustrious alumni gather for memoir launchPigsback.com  a discount deals and rewards website  was launched in Dublin’s Grand Canal Dock on a hot day in July 2000  its founder Michael Dwyer recalls in his new book  From the Arena  based on journals he has kept over two decades in business.The colour pink was the theme of the launch  with pink cocktails served to guests  many decked out in pink shirts and dresses. Dwyer’s sister  Geraldine  recruited two on-street promoters from Dundalk  one called Brian  who arrived in pig suits. At one point Brian took off his pig’s head to get a breather  putting it down beside him on a wall. Whereupon a local rascal zoomed up on a bike and grabbed it.“Brian must have felt that the very success of Pigsback was in his hands when  in full pig regalia  he gave chase ” writes Dwyer. The thief was clearly surprised by the speed of the pursuing porcine  since he dropped the head  and Brian brought back the bacon. “Now that’s commitment ” marvels Dwyer.From the Arena  edited by the writer Gavin Daly  was launched at the Cafe du Journal in Monkstown last week. Master of ceremonies was Gareth Lambe  an early Pigsback employee who became head of Meta in Ireland. His successor Anne O’Leary was among the attendees – she  Lambe and Dwyer are neighbours in Monkstown.Also spotted were Cillian Barry  another ex-Pigsbacker  who sold his gaming company SportsCaller business to the American casino corporation Bally’s for €40 million; and Dwyer’s brother John  chairman of Renatus  a private equity firm.RTÉ's Player finally a playerThe RTÉ Player was once called “perhaps the most notorious software ever created in Ireland” and a “glitchy abomination” by a TV critic of this newspaper. Quietly  though  Montrose has sorted it out. Audience numbers are growing  and there are fewer criticisms about the online streaming service stalling  or about the ads looping instead of the programme playing.RTÉ has told me that streams this year are up 20 per cent  at 31.4 million  with time spent viewing up 50 per cent. That follows a successful 2022  with 80 million streams  up 18 per cent on the previous year.Sport accounted for 11.9 million streams last year  including the World Cup in Qatar  and the Republic of Ireland qualifying for the Fifa Women’s World Cup. This year’s rugby Grand Slam naturally proved popular  with 621 000 streams recorded.Box sets are the biggest draw  though  and accounted for 15 million streams last year. Normal People had 1.1 million of those  bringing the total since its release to 7.2 million. With Netflix in decline  might RTÉ’s streaming service finally be a player?Learning from incarcerated Harry CassidyEven though he is now serving a sentence of six years and 10 months for conspiracy to defraud investors  Harry Cassidy is still offering to teach English online. Courses by the former boss of Custom House Capital are being advertised on Udemy for as little as €9.99  including one called The Most Common Mistakes in English and How to Avoid Them. The price represents a steep discount on the original €79.99.Cassidy seems to be better at teaching than he was at investing. His instructor rating on Udemy is 4.5 out of five  based on 969 reviews from the 27 501 students who took his courses.It’s not clear how incarceration will affect Cassidy’s new career.

Presentations include data from the PRESTO 2 and HomeLAN surveys which demonstrated patient-reported benefits when administering Somatuline® Autogel®/Somatuline® Depot (lanreotide). These include fewer patients reporting experiencing injection-site pain and high levels of injection experience satisfaction when participating in patient support programs (PSP)  respectively.Data from PRESTO 2  an e-survey which evaluated injection site pain in people living with gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) or acromegaly (n=219 and n=85)  demonstrated that significantly fewer patients receiving Somatuline Autogel/Somatuline Depot pre-filled syringe had reported injection-site pain lasting more than two days after their last dose compared with the octreotide long acting release syringe (OCT) (6.0% vs 22.8% [primary endpoint]; odds ratio  adjusted for disease group and occurrence of injection-site reaction: 0.13 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.06  0.30]; p<0.0001).1 Furthermore  compared with OCT  fewer patients treated with Somatuline Autogel/Somatuline Depot  reported interference with daily life as a result of injection-site pain (41% vs 60%).1Professor Dermot O’Toole  Consultant Gastroenterologist (Dublin at St. Vincent’s and St James’s Hospitals & Trinity College) and Neuroendocrine Tumor Specialist in the ENETS accredited European Centre of Excellence in St Vincent’s Hospital Dublin said  “These new data from PRESTO 2 reinforce the importance of gathering feedback directly from patients to understand the impact of their treatment on their wellbeing. Injection-site pain can be a real concern for patients  especially for those who are on longterm treatment regimens  so it is interesting to see that significantly fewer patients receiving Somatuline Autogel/Somatuline Depot reported injection-site pain compared with the octreotide long-acting release syringe. These data will help healthcare professionals better understand the impact of injection-site pain  an important consideration to discuss with patients when making treatment decisions.”Ipsen is also presenting new data from its HomeLAN survey  evaluating the injection experience satisfaction of people living with GEP-NETs who participate in PSPs. Somatuline Autogel PSPs aim to assist patients receiving their treatment at home  reducing both travel burden and the current risk of COVID-19 exposure. Furthermore  after training  patients on stable dose can administer Somatuline Autogel independently (self or partner)  where approved. This study evaluated patients’ reported injection experience and the impact of administration in the home setting. Overall  95.5% (95% CI 89.89–98.06) of patients were satisfied with their most recent at-home injection experience by a HCP  with around 70% reporting that it made them feel ‘a great deal’ or ‘quite a bit’ in control of their lives. The majority of participants (85%) strongly agreed that the PSP met their medical needs.2Professor Steven Hildemann  Executive Vice President  Chief Medical Officer  Head of Global Medical Affairs and Patient Safety  Ipsen said  “Ipsen has a longstanding heritage in neuroendocrine tumors and our data presented at the ENETS Conference showcase our ongoing commitment to the patient community. We continue to listen and learn from patients  with the goal of finding new opportunities throughout their treatment journey. By gathering direct feedback  data and insights from patients and healthcare professionals  we can continually evaluate our delivery systems and patient support resources to drive the best possible patient outcomes.”Please see below for details of all Ipsen data at ENETS Conference 2022:Abstract Authors Presentation details PRESTO 2: an international patient survey to evaluate impact of injection and delivery system on local pain when administering somatostatin analogue (SSA) therapyO’Toole et al.

Poster Factors at Time of Diagnosis Associated with Progressive or Stable Disease in Patients with Small Intestinal Neuroendocrine Tumors (SI-NETs)Schalin-Jäntti et al PosterAbout neuroendocrine tumorsNeuroendocrine tumors  or NETs  are a group of uncommon tumors that develop in the cells of the neuroendocrine system  throughout the body.3 4 NETs occur in both men and women  in general aged 50 to 60 years old  although they can affect anyone of any age.6The three areas where NETs are mostly found in the body are the gastrointestinal tract  the pancreas and the lungs.4Gastrointestinal NETs (GI-NETs) are found in the gastrointestinal tract or digestive system and are the most common type of NETs. 4Pancreatic NETs (panNETs) are formed in the islet cells of the pancreas and include several uncommon types of NETs. 4Lung NETs account for about 20 – 30% of all NETs.8The symptoms of NETs are often not distinct and difficult to identify  and can sometimes take up to seven years to diagnose.5 The number of people being newly diagnosed with NETs overall is believed to be rising.6 This is mainly due to increased awareness of the condition and diagnostic testing.6About PRESTO 21PRESTO 2 is an international patient survey to evaluate impact of injection and delivery system on local pain when administrating somatostatin analogue (SSA) therapy. An e-survey of adults with NETs or acromegaly from Canada  the USA  UK and Ireland  who had received more than three months’ of treatment with LAN or OCT (n=304)  was used to investigate the proportion of patients with injection-site pain lasting more than two days after last injection (primary end point) as well as interference with daily life as a result of injection-site pain (among secondary end points).About HomeLAN2HomeLAN is a non-interventional  cross-sectional survey of adults with NETs  enrolled in PSPs in Belgium  Greece  Spain and The Netherlands for six or more months and receiving LAN at home. The target sample size was 120  based on the number of eligible patients and a 15% response rate. Endpoints included patient satisfaction with the most recent LAN injection (primary) and reasons for choosing their mode of administration (among secondary endpoints).About Somatuline® Autogel®/Somatuline® Depot (lanreotide)7Somatuline® Autogel®/Somatuline® Depot is made of the active substance lanreotide and is a long-acting somatostatin analogue that inhibits the secretion of growth hormone and certain hormones secreted by the digestive system. The licensed indications of Somatuline® Autogel® are7:The treatment of individuals with acromegaly when the circulating levels of Growth Hormone and/or Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 remain abnormal after surgery and/or radiotherapy  or in patients who otherwise require medical treatment.The treatment of grade 1 and a subset of grade 2 (Ki-67 index up to 10%) gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) of midgut  pancreatic or unknown origin where hindgut sites of origin have been excluded  in adult patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic disease.The treatment of symptoms associated with neuroendocrine (particularly carcinoid) tumors. The recommended starting dose is one injection of Somatuline Autogel 60 to 120 mg administered every 28 days.The decision regarding independent administration of Somatuline Autogel/Somatuline Depot is only applicable to countries where this option is approved in the Product Information/Summary of Product Characteristics and for patients on stable dose upon HCP decision and after appropriate training by HCP.The detailed recommendations for the use of Somatuline® Autogel® are described in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and US Prescribing Information (PI).About IpsenIpsen is a global  mid-sized biopharmaceutical company focused on transformative medicines in Oncology  Rare Disease and Neuroscience; it also has a well-established consumer healthcare business.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words “believes”  “anticipates” and “expects” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising product in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons and also taking into consideration assessment delays of certain clinical trials in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic products that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the Research and Development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a product in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the product concerned. There can be no guarantees a product will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the product will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and health care legislation; global trends toward health care cost containment; technological advances  new products and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new product development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative products; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its products which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forwardlooking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law.

The application is based on data from the pivotal XTEND-1 phase 3 study in adults and adolescents and the XTEND-Kids paediatric study in patients <12 years of age. Efanesoctocog alfa was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as ALTUVIIIO earlier this year.""Sobi aims to raise the standard of care for rare disease patients around the globe "" said Tony Hoos  MD  PhD  Head of Research & Development and Chief Medical Officer. ""Today's announcement may represent a crucial step towards improving the lives of people with haemophilia A through a potential new treatment option. We look forward to working closely with EMA during their review of our dossier to allow timely access for the haemophilia community in Europe.""Haemophilia A is a rare  genetic disorder in which the ability of a person's blood to clot is impaired due to a lack of factor VIII. Haemophilia A occurs in about one in 5 000 male births annually  and more rarely in females. People with haemophilia can experience bleeding episodes including life-threatening haemorrhages  acute and chronic pain  irreversible joint damage with disability and negative impacts on quality of life. Despite advancements in treatment made in recent years  a large unmet medical need still exists and requires further improvement in the standard of care.About XTEND-1XTEND-1 was an open-label  non-randomized interventional study with two parallel assignment arms. Participants in the prophylaxis arm received a weekly prophylactic dose of efanesoctocog alfa for 52 weeks. Participants in on-demand arm received efanesoctocog alfa on demand for 26 weeks followed by a switch to weekly prophylaxis for another 26 weeks. XTEND-1 evaluated efficacy  safety and pharmacokinetics in 159 previously treated patients ≥12 years of age with severe haemophilia A.About XTEND-KidsXTEND-Kids was an open-label  non-randomised interventional  single-arm study. Participants received a weekly prophylactic dose of efanesoctocog alfa for 52 weeks. XTEND-Kids evaluates efficacy  safety  and pharmacokinetics in 74 previously treated patients <12 years of age with severe haemophilia A.About efanesoctocog alfaEfanesoctocog alfa [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant)  Fc-VWF-XTEN Fusion Protein] (formerly BIVV001) is a novel and investigational recombinant factor VIII therapy with the potential to deliver near-normal factor activity levels for a significant parts of the week  improving bleed protection in a once-weekly dose for people with haemophilia A. Efanesoctocog alfa builds on the innovative Fc fusion technology by adding a region of von Willebrand factor and XTEN® polypeptides to extend its time in circulation. It is the only therapy that has been shown to break through the von Willebrand factor ceiling  which imposes a half-life limitation on current factor VIII therapies. It was approved as ALTUVIIIO [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant)  Fc-VWF-XTEN Fusion Protein-ehtl] by Sanofi in the US in February 2023. It is not approved in any country outside the US.About the Sanofi and Sobi collaborationSobi and Sanofi collaborate on the development and commercialization of Alprolix® and Elocta®/Eloctate®. The companies also collaborate on the development and commercialisation of efanesoctocog alfa or ALTUVIIIO in the US. Sobi has final development and commercialisation rights in the Sobi territory (essentially Europe  North Africa  Russia  and most Middle Eastern markets).
