(ISS)  and Qontigo  a leading global provider of innovative index  analytics and risk solutions  today announced the release of the ISS STOXX Biodiversity Index Suite to mark the U.,"Combination of high-quality index construction and data-driven insights offer customizable strategies for biodiversity investmentNEW YORK and ZUG  Switzerland  May 22  2023 /PRNewswire/ -- ISS ESG  the sustainable investment arm of Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. (ISS)  and Qontigo  a leading global provider of innovative index  analytics and risk solutions  today announced the release of the ISS STOXX Biodiversity Index Suite to mark the U.N.'s International Day for Biological Diversity.ISS ESGThe new cobranded index suite helps interested clients align portfolios with their biodiversity impact reduction goals. All indices in the suite exclude companies involved in activities assessed to be causing significant harm to biodiversity or reducing the biodiversity footprint. They also enhance alignment with biodiversity-oriented U.N. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)  such as life below water and life on land. At the same time  the index methodology targets an aggregate reduction in carbon intensity of at least 30 percent across the included constituents.In addition to the baseline family  the suite also includes a Biodiversity Leaders family which consists solely of companies deriving at least 20 percent of their revenues from activities that are deemed to make a positive net contribution to the SDGs. These activities include preservation of marine ecosystems and sustainable agriculture and forestry.""Biodiversity is one of the paramount themes of our age and calls for investors to understand and address its associated risks in their investment portfolios "" said Axel Lomholt  Chief Product Officer for Indices & Benchmarks at STOXX. ""This launch comes as global investors are urged by some to account for and price nature into their sustainable investment strategies  and we are confident that the unique combination of our high-quality STOXX index suite  together with ISS ESG's rigorous data sets  will prove valuable in enabling investors to align with their biodiversity objectives.""Story continuesEach new index family uses a granular index construction methodology  built on ISS ESG's extensive datasets and a three-part framework to select index constituents based upon an avoid  minimize and enable approach: avoid companies involved in activities causing harm to biodiversity; minimize exposure to companies with negative impacts on biodiversity; and capture companies enabling positive impact on biodiversity through scoring high on biodiversity solutions. Importantly  this framework goes beyond simple exclusion criteria  positively screening for companies with low negative impact on biodiversity and those companies actively enabling the planet's biodiversity – in line with COP15 goals.""Investor focus on managing biodiversity impact has the potential to become as significant and enduring as the current focus on climate change "" said Lorraine Kelly  Global Head of Investment Stewardship at ISS. ""The ISS STOXX Biodiversity Index Suite is the latest example of ISS ESG powering highly differentiated index offerings and we are delighted to partner with Qontigo on this series.""About ISS ESGISS ESG solutions enable investors to develop and integrate sustainable investing policies and practices  engage on sustainable investment issues  and monitor portfolio company practices through screening solutions.

XTB has been systematically expanding its offer with new products. This is driven by ...,XTB Starts Offering Stocks in the MENA RegionXTB  global fintech  is expanding its investment offer in the MENA region. Starting May 22nd  investors will have the opportunity to invest in stocks from the 15 largest stock exchanges in the world  including the NYSE  LSE and Deutsche Boerse.XTB has been systematically expanding its offer with new products. This is driven by the desire to offer the users of the proprietary investment platform the widest possible opportunities of capital allocation options. For several years  investments based on real stocks and ETFs have been increasingly popular. From May 22nd  investors from the MENA region will have access to these types of investments.New investment opportunitiesUntil now  XTB's offer in the MENA market was based on CFDs. The last two years of the global fintech in this market show that there is enormous investment potential in this region  thus the expansion of the product offering.Starting from May 22nd  XTB's offer in the MENA market will include real stocks (from the European and US stock markets) and ETFs (from the European markets). Users of the XTB platform will have the opportunity to purchase stocks and ETFs from up to 15 of the largest stock exchanges in the world  including The New York Stock Exchange  London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Boerse.- The development of our product offer in the MENA market is a natural step in our growth. Our goal is to provide our clients with a full investment spectrum so we are constantly working on the development from both the perspective of products but also technology - says Omar Arnaout  CEO of XTB. - I will also not hide the fact that our branch in Dubai is one of the fastest growing. This shows the enormous interest in financial markets in this region and I am pleased that local investors will gain new investment opportunities - Arnaout adds.Investors interested in stocks and ETFs at XTB will receive an extremely attractive offer in financial terms. The minimum transaction value starts at 10 EUR. However  what is important  the investment platform does not charge any commissions for such transactions until the monthly turnover exceeds 100 000 EUR. Above this limit  transactions in stocks and ETFs are charged a commission of 0.2% (min. 10 EUR).Increased interest in the capital marketThe addition of stocks and ETFs to XTB's offer is the expansion of possibilities for users with different investment strategies. CFD-based instruments are characterized by high volatility and are intended for active investors  where stocks  and especially ETFs  are products for people leaning towards more passive investing. In some markets  e.g. in Poland  Portugal  Romania and the Czech Republic  a significant part of XTB clients buy shares and ETF funds.- The recent years during the COVID-19 pandemic  the tense geopolitical situation and rampant global inflation have created many investment opportunities in the market. Both for proponents of active and passive investing. I am pleased that with the expansion of XTB's offer in the MENA region  local investors will gain new investment opportunities - says Achraf Drid  director of XTB MENA.In the first quarter of 2023  XTB generated over EUR 64.4 mm in consolidated net profit. This is a record quarterly result in the company's history. Furthermore  the total number of clients on the global investment platform exceeded 721 000  with an increase of over 104 000 in the first quarter of this year alone.,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.67,0.15,0.18,True,English,"['MENA Region', 'XTB', 'Stocks', 'The New York Stock Exchange', 'London Stock Exchange', '15 largest stock exchanges', 'New investment opportunities', 'widest possible opportunities', 'minimum transaction value', 'tense geopolitical situation', 'record quarterly result', 'full investment spectrum', 'different investment strategies', 'many investment opportunities', 'capital allocation options', 'rampant global inflation', 'US stock markets', 'last two years', 'proprietary investment platform', 'enormous investment potential', 'global investment platform', 'new products', 'global fintech', 'enormous interest', 'several years', 'recent years', 'investment offer', 'capital market', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'product offering', 'natural step', 'financial markets', 'financial terms', 'monthly turnover', 'Increased interest', 'CFD-based instruments', 'high volatility', 'passive investing', 'Czech Republic', 'significant part', 'ETF funds', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Achraf Drid', 'first quarter', 'net profit', 'total number', 'XTB platform', 'MENA Region', 'MENA market', 'European markets', 'Omar Arnaout', 'local investors', 'attractive offer', 'XTB MENA', 'real stocks', 'active investors', 'XTB clients', 'opportunity', 'world', 'NYSE', 'LSE', 'desire', 'users', 'investments', 'ETFs', 'May', 'access', 'types', 'CFDs', 'expansion', 'development', 'growth', 'goal', 'perspective', 'technology', 'CEO', 'fact', 'branch', 'Dubai', '10 EUR', 'commissions', 'transactions', 'limit', 'addition', 'possibilities', 'people', 'Poland', 'Portugal', 'Romania', 'shares', 'proponents', 'director', 'consolidated', 'company', 'history', '000']",2023-05-22,2023-05-22,financialit.net

Raising an initial $342 million (300 …,Mediawan has been shaking the foundations of the film and TV world in France and Europe since it was launched in 2015 by producer Pierre-Antoine Capton  billionaire entrepreneur Xavier Niel and financier Matthieu Pigasse.Raising an initial $342 million (300 million euros) by listing shares on the Euronext Paris stock exchange in 2016  the Paris-based group has since gathered some 70 film and TV production labels under its umbrella as well as secured the backing of U.S. investment firms KKR and Atwater Capitol.High-profile acquisitions have included the television division of Luc Besson’s EuropaCorp; Lagardère Studios and its 25 labels  including Spain’s Boomerang Group; French production houses Chapter 2  Chi-Fou-Mi  Radar Films and Call My Agent creator Mon Voisin Productions as well as Italian producer Palomar.In 2021  it took a majority stake in the U.K.’s Drama Republic  while on the eve of Cannes  it bought Submarine  the Amsterdam and Los Angeles multi-platform behind the Emmy-award-winning documentary Bellingcat: Truth in a Post-Truth World and Richard Linklater’s animated feature Apollo 10 1⁄2: A Space Age Childhood.“We’re a French company based in France but the idea is to create a European studio made up of the best talents in Europe  in cinema  animation  documentary  series and live studio shows  and to help them make their productions  distribute them and export them internationally ” says Mediawan Pictures CEO Elisabeth d’Arvieu in an interview at the group’s seven-floor Paris HQ  home to many of the French labels.“We don’t go after a company because it’s specialized in a particular type of genre. We rather connect with producers because of their talent. They’re often very anchored in their local market but produce content that travels. We’re also looking for people who share the same ambitions and DNA as us. It has to be the right fit.”The burgeoning content group made headlines beyond Europe last December when it announced it was acquiring a significant stake in Brad Pitt’s company Plan B Entertainment.Curiosity about the $300 million deal and how the production house behind The Departed  12 Years a Slave and Moonlight will fit into the Mediawan fold is rife on both sides of the Atlantic.“This partnership is an important step for us ” says d’Arvieu. “We’re a European studio  our DNA is European  but our vision is international. While our producers and talent are carrying projects that are local in nature  their international ambitions are growing.”She continues: “The American market is an important one for European works  and we understood we needed a partner in situ. Until now  we’ve been working on a case-by-case basis  but we wanted a partner who could be the image of Mediawan in the U.S.”Nicola Serra  managing director of Rome-based film and TV The Name Of The Rose production company Palomar which joined the Mediawan fold in 2019  thinks the partnership will be a game-changer.His company has already successfully made inroads into the U.S. market with the Dominic Cooper and Douglas Booth-starring spaghetti Western series The Dirty Black Bag  which sold AMC+ in 2021  but he believes the Plan B connection will expand opportunities.“It’s difficult for a European company to be accepted and gain trust as a credible player in the U.S. Every time you want to pitch a project or sign a top talent  you need to prove yourself. We’ve built a network and reputation  but it’s really hard work and takes time ” says Serra.“I think that now  for whoever within the group has good ideas for international projects with U.S. potential  this connection with Plan B will help and accelerate the process of getting them off the ground  if the projects are good  of course.”D’Arvieu emphasizes that at the heart of Mediawan’s approach is respect for the independence of its producers and says this is a factor that helped facilitate the tie-in with Plan B. “When a producer joins Mediawan  there is one thing we pledge to uphold  and that is their total independence in terms of creativity and production. We’re never going to dictate what they make.“They are protective of their creative independence  which fits perfectly with our DNA ” she says. “We came together in a fairly natural way. The idea is to build bridges between the United States and Europe  to bring European talents onto the international market.”The executive points to the trajectory of Florian Zeller  the Oscar-winning director The Father  whose Paris and LA-based production company Blue Morning Pictures is backed by Mediawan  as an example of a French talent who has made it on both sides of the Atlantic.Plan B co-presidents Dede Gardner and Jeremy Kleiner traveled to Paris in mid-April for meetings with some of its European producers. Similar trips are also planned to Spain and Italy.Quizzed on first projects  D’Arvieu says ideas are cooking. “We only finalized the deal in January. It’s early days  but the exchanges have started already  and the aim is really to create exchanges between all our talent like Florian  Plan B  Chapter 2  Palomar  Chi-Fou-Mi…”Chi-Fou-Mi founder and president Hugo Sélignac says the exchanges go both ways.“When you lunch with Jeremy Kleiner  he’s asking questions about the French market and I’m asking him questions about the U.S. market and we’re chatting about projects at the same time ” he says. “There’s a lot of scope for synergies  not just with Plan B  but also other companies in the group. I also talk a lot  for example  with Palomar.”Evoking the new Plan B connection  Radar Films founder Clément Miserez suggests that there is a gap in the U.S. market for the type of family film his company specializes in alongside genre fare.He points to the Netflix success of Radar’s 2021 film Vicky And Her Mystery  about a motherless girl who forms a bond with a wolf cub “When we embarked on international sales  U.S. buyers told us there was no longer an appetite for those White Fang  Free Willy style films. It was all Pixar  Marvel and Illumination  but then the film went up on Netflix and it was an enormous success  staying in the top 10 for weeks ” he says.Outside of Mediawan’s Transatlantic ambitions  the focus is on its European hub  where the group is steadily growing its cinema footprint  alongside its TV production activities  particularly in France.It successfully launched the first part of Martin Bourboulon’s ambitious $72 million two-part  French-language Alexandre Dumas adaptation The Three Musketeers: D’Artagnan in early April. Spearheaded by Dimitri Rassam at Chapter 2  in collaboration with Pathé  and starring François Civil  Vincent Cassel  Romain Duris  Pio Marmaï  Eva Green  Louis Garrel  Vicky Krieps  and Lyna Khoudri  the film has drawn more than three million spectators at home and achieved a total worldwide gross of $27 million to date.‘On the Wandering Path’ Radar FilmsTwo other films produced by Mediawan labels have also enjoyed success in recent weeks: Denis Imbert’s On The Wandering Path (Radar Films) and Jeanne Harry’s ensemble drama All Your Faces (Chi-Fou-Mi Productions).The 2023 release slate also includes Chapter 2’s Carmen by Benjamin Millepied and The Three Musketeers: Milady  as well as Chi-Fou-Mi titles Omar La Fraise (which world premieres as a Cannes Midnight screening) and Nathan Ambrosioni’s Camille Cottin-starrer Toni  En Famille. Also coming up are Autumn and the Black Jaguar  the latest production from Mia and the White Lion director Gilles de Maistre under his Mai-Juin Productions banner  and Jeremy Zag’s Miraculous  on which Mediawan label On Kids & Family is a producer.“We’re across all types of cinemas from tentpoles to family films  auteur and genre works ” d’Arvieu says. “We don’t favor any one type of film. What interests us is the project  the talent  and the possibility that the film can travel.”Chi-Fou-Mi’s Sélignac says the group’s openness to variety was just one of the reasons he decided it would be a good fit for him.“When I first started talking to Pierre-Antoine Capton in 2018  the range of what I was making was one of the things he appreciated ” says Sélignac  who signed with Mediawan on the evening of the Cannes premiere for his production The Stronghold in 2021.“I felt that with Pierre-Antoine and Elisabeth  I could be part of a group that liked what I did and had the same desire to live this adventure with me as I moved from films like The Stronghold to a film about depressed men in their swimming trunks (Sink or Swim)  to an Algerian film that goes to Cannes (Omar La Fraise)  to a film by Jeanne Herry (All Your Faces)  which basically involves people sitting around the table and still manages to bring a million spectators  to a film about a giant fly by Quentin Dupieux (Mandibles) ” he says.The producer recalls that film industry colleagues warned him that he risked losing his independence by entering Mediawan.“I can only talk about my experiences  but I’ve never felt more independent ” he says. “I signed one year into the Covid pandemic  during which time I’d seen the conditions for the producing profession get tougher and producers who had been at the height of their success get into difficulty. It’s reassuring to be part of a group and at the same time have the freedom to follow my own editorial line  which has only one criterion: quality.”Sélignac says that until now  the group has never intervened in any of his projects and there are no constraints on who he can partner with on his projects  with Mediawan happily working across all distribution platforms and sources of finance. He does reveal  however  that he has a three-monthly meeting with d’Arvieu  her team and Mediawan CFO Guillaume Izabel to discuss his slate.“People said that this would be the thing that would most de-stabilize me  but not all — it’s fantastic. If I manage to convince 10 people that my projects are cool  when I arrive on the market to drum up finance  it’s like I’ve gone through a rehearsal. It’s always a pleasure to talk to them about what we’re working on.”Miserez  whose company joined Mediawan in 2019 says being part of the group allows him to focus on his favorite part of the job.Read the digital edition of Deadline’s Disruptors/Cannes magazine here“Just because you achieved millions of entries with your last film  doesn’t make it easier to achieve the same with the next. Every film is a prototype  every time you embark on a production  it’s like you’re defending your title again ” he says.“Being part of a larger  well-oiled system enables me to concentrate on the bits of the job I love most  working with the talent  producing films and developing scripts.”After 15 years of producing films for theatrical release  Miserez says being part of Mediawan  which has an even bigger presence in TV  has also helped him to move into producing films for traditional broadcasters as well as the platforms.Radar’s first TV film Comme Mon Fils recently drew 4.2 million viewers for its first broadcast on TF1  while the company is currently working on its first Original with Netflix and is also developing its first-ever series.“It’s impossible to stay in this activity without producing for the broadcaster and platforms  and there is a savoir-faire within the Mediawan group that has enabled me to do this.”,neutral,0.0,0.99,0.0,mixed,0.44,0.13,0.42,True,English,"['Mediawan Pictures CEO Elisabeth D’Arvieu', 'Brad Pitt', 'Plan B', 'Deadline Disruptors', 'Company', 'Approach', 'LA-based production company Blue Morning Pictures', 'Mediawan Pictures CEO Elisabeth d’Arvieu', 'Douglas Booth-starring spaghetti Western series', 'billionaire entrepreneur Xavier Niel', 'A Space Age Childhood', 'The Dirty Black Bag', 'Euronext Paris stock exchange', 'U.S. investment firms', 'The Rose production company', 'Lagardère Studios', 'Los Angeles multi-platform', 'presidents Dede Gardner', 'The American market', 'U.S. potential', 'producer Pierre-Antoine Capton', 'live studio shows', 'seven-floor Paris HQ', 'Mon Voisin Productions', 'U.S. market', 'Plan B Entertainment', 'Italian producer Palomar', 'TV production labels', 'burgeoning content group', 'Plan B connection', 'French production', 'production house', 'The Departed', 'The Father', 'Plan B.', 'U.K.', 'local market', 'international market', 'French company', 'European company', 'European studio', 'TV world', 'Matthieu Pigasse', '300 million euros', 'Atwater Capitol', 'High-profile acquisitions', 'television division', 'Luc Besson', 'Radar Films', 'Agent creator', 'majority stake', 'Drama Republic', 'Post-Truth World', 'Richard Linklater', 'animated feature', 'best talents', 'French labels', 'particular type', 'same ambitions', 'right fit', 'significant stake', 'Brad Pitt', 'important step', 'international ambitions', 'important one', 'European works', 'managing director', 'Dominic Cooper', 'hard work', 'one thing', 'natural way', 'United States', 'European talents', 'Oscar-winning director', 'Jeremy Kleiner', 'Similar trips', 'early days', 'Mediawan fold', 'Paris-based group', 'Boomerang Group', 'total independence', 'creative independence', 'Emmy-award-winning documentary', '$300 million deal', 'case basis', 'Nicola Serra', 'good ideas', 'international projects', 'Florian Zeller', 'first projects', 'top talent', 'French talent', 'Rome-based film', 'European producers', 'Arvieu.', '25 labels', '70 film', 'foundations', 'France', 'financier', 'initial $342', 'listing', 'shares', 'umbrella', 'backing', 'KKR', 'EuropaCorp', 'Spain', 'Chapter', 'Chi-Fou-Mi', 'Call', 'Cannes', 'Submarine', 'Amsterdam', 'Bellingcat', 'Apollo 10', 'cinema', 'animation', 'interview', 'genre', 'people', 'DNA', 'headlines', 'Curiosity', '12 Years', 'Slave', 'Moonlight', 'sides', 'Atlantic', 'partnership', 'nature', 'situ', 'image', 'Name', 'game-changer', 'inroads', 'AMC+', 'opportunities', 'trust', 'player', 'network', 'reputation', 'time', 'process', 'ground', 'heart', 'approach', 'respect', 'factor', 'terms', 'creativity', 'bridges', 'executive', 'trajectory', 'example', 'mid-April', 'meetings', 'Italy', 'January', 'exchanges', 'aim', '1⁄2']",2023-05-21,2023-05-22,deadline.com

These results will also be presented in the “Breaking News: Clinical Trial Results in Pulmonary Medicine” session on May 22.Surya Bhatt  M.D.  MSPHAssociate Professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham Division of Pulmonary  Allergy  and Critical Care Medicine  and a co-principal investigator of the trial""I've seen patients with uncontrolled chronic obstructive pulmonary disease struggle for far too long with the debilitating symptoms of this progressive disease – with limited  incremental improvement on current treatment options. This trial showed that dupilumab has the potential to impact the vicious cycle of exacerbations and lung function decline in patients with uncontrolled COPD with type 2 inflammation  and significantly improve respiratory symptoms. Dupilumab also helped improve health-related quality of life measures  which  from my years of experience as a physician  are just as meaningful for patients as being able to breathe easier.”COPD is a life-threatening respiratory disease that damages the lungs and causes progressive lung function decline. Symptoms include persistent cough and breathlessness that may not only impair the ability to perform routine daily activities  but can also lead to anxiety  depression and sleep disturbances. COPD is also associated with a significant health and economic burden due to recurrent acute exacerbations that require systemic corticosteroid treatment and/or lead to hospitalization or even death. Smoking and exposure to noxious particles are key risk factors for COPD  but even individuals who quit smoking can still develop or continue having the disease. In the U.S. alone  approximately 300 000 people live with uncontrolled COPD with evidence of type 2 inflammation.The results presented at ATS and published in NEJM are from the BOREAS trial  which met the primary and all key secondary endpoints. As presented and published  patients receiving Dupixent (n=468) compared to placebo (n=471) added to maximal standard-of-care inhaled triple therapy experienced a:30% reduction in moderate or severe acute COPD exacerbations over 52 weeks (p<0.001)  the primary endpoint.160 mL improvement in lung function from baseline at 12 weeks versus 77 mL (p<0.001). Numerical improvements were observed as early as 2 weeks  with the benefit versus placebo sustained through 52 weeks (Dupixent: 153 mL  placebo: 70 mL; p<0.001).9.7-point improvement in health-related quality of life (QoL; patient-reported outcome on a scale from 0-100) from baseline at 52 weeks versus a 6.4-point improvement (p=0.002)  with numerical improvements observed as early as 4 weeks.2.7-point reduction in respiratory symptom severity (patient-reported outcome on a scale from 0-40) from baseline at 52 weeks versus a 1.6-point reduction (p=0.001).In a pre-specified analysis from a subgroup of patients (Dupixent n=195  placebo n=188) with elevated levels (≥20 ppb) of fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) – an airway biomarker of type 2 inflammation – Dupixent treatment also led to a significant 38% reduction in exacerbations compared to placebo at 52 weeks (p=0.005). In this subgroup  Dupixent also led to an improvement in lung function of 232 mL versus 108 mL for placebo at 12 weeks (p=0.002) that was sustained at 52 weeks with an improvement in lung function of 247 mL versus 120 mL for placebo (p=0.003).The safety results were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. Overall rates of adverse events (AEs) were 77% for Dupixent and 76% for placebo. AEs more commonly observed with Dupixent compared to placebo included headache (8.1% Dupixent  6.8% placebo)  diarrhea (5.3% Dupixent  3.6% placebo) and back pain (5.1% Dupixent  3.4% placebo). AEs more commonly observed with placebo compared to Dupixent included upper respiratory tract infection (9.8% placebo  7.9% Dupixent)  hypertension (6.0% placebo  3.6% Dupixent) and COVID-19 (5.7% placebo  4.1% Dupixent). AEs leading to deaths were balanced between the two arms (1.7% placebo  1.5% Dupixent).The second  replicate Phase 3 trial of Dupixent in COPD with evidence of type 2 inflammation (NOTUS) is ongoing  with data expected in 2024. The safety and efficacy of Dupixent in COPD are currently under clinical investigation and have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority. Sanofi and Regeneron look forward to discussing the BOREAS data with regulators.About the Dupixent COPD Phase 3 Trial ProgramBOREAS is one of two pivotal trials in the Dupixent COPD program. The randomized  Phase 3  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in 939 adults who were current or former smokers aged 40 to 80 years with moderate-to-severe COPD. All patients in the trial had evidence of type 2 inflammation  as measured by blood eosinophils ≥300 cells/µL. Patents with a diagnosis or history of asthma were excluded from the trial. During the 52-week treatment period  patients received Dupixent or placebo every two weeks added to a maximal standard-of-care inhaled triple therapy of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)  long-acting beta agonists  and long-acting muscarinic antagonists. Double maintenance therapy was allowed if ICS was contraindicated.The primary endpoint evaluated the annualized rate of acute moderate or severe COPD exacerbations. Moderate exacerbations were defined as those requiring systemic steroids and/or antibiotics. Severe exacerbations were defined as those: requiring hospitalization; requiring more than a day of observation in an emergency department or urgent care facility; or resulting in death.Key secondary and other hierarchy endpoints included:Change from baseline in lung function (assessed by pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume over one second [FEV1]) at 12 and 52 weeks in both the overall population and those with FeNO ≥ 20 ppb.Change from baseline at 52 weeks in St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score compared to placebo (scale from 0-100).Change from baseline at 52 weeks in the Evaluating Respiratory Symptoms in COPD (E-RS: COPD) scale score (scale from 0-40).The annualized rate of acute moderate or severe COPD exacerbations in patients with FeNO ≥ 20 ppb.About Sanofi and Regeneron’s COPD Clinical Research ProgramSanofi and Regeneron are motivated to transform the treatment paradigm of COPD by examining the role different types of inflammation play in the disease progression through the investigation of two potentially first-in-class biologics  Dupixent and itepekimab.Dupixent inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and the program focuses on a specific population of people with evidence of type 2 inflammation. Itepekimab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits interleukin-33 (IL-33)  an initiator and amplifier of broad inflammation in COPD. Across both programs  four Phase 3 trials are ongoing and designed to inform next-generation treatments for people with COPD who might not have other options.Itepekimab is currently under clinical investigation and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.About DupixentDupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent  such as atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) and prurigo nodularis.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP  EoE or prurigo nodularis in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in Europe  the U.S. and Japan. More than 600 000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including pediatric EoE  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritus of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About RegeneronRegeneron (NASDAQ: REGN) is a leading biotechnology company that invents  develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

Smoking and exposure to noxious particles are key risk factors for COPD  but even individuals who quit smoking can still develop or continue having the disease. In the U.S. alone  approximately 300 000 people live with uncontrolled COPD with evidence of type 2 inflammation.The results presented at ATS and published in NEJM are from the BOREAS trial  which met the primary and all key secondary endpoints. As presented and published  patients receiving Dupixent (n=468) compared to placebo (n=471) added to maximal standard-of-care inhaled triple therapy experienced a:30% reduction in moderate or severe acute COPD exacerbations over 52 weeks (p<0.001)  the primary endpoint.160 mL improvement in lung function from baseline at 12 weeks versus 77 mL (p<0.001). Numerical improvements were observed as early as 2 weeks  with the benefit versus placebo sustained through 52 weeks (Dupixent: 153 mL  placebo: 70 mL; p<0.001).9.7-point improvement in health-related quality of life (QoL; patient-reported outcome on a scale from 0-100) from baseline at 52 weeks versus a 6.4-point improvement (p=0.002)  with numerical improvements observed as early as 4 weeks.2.7-point reduction in respiratory symptom severity (patient-reported outcome on a scale from 0-40) from baseline at 52 weeks versus a 1.6-point reduction (p=0.001).In a pre-specified analysis from a subgroup of patients (Dupixent n=195  placebo n=188) with elevated levels (≥20 ppb) of fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) – an airway biomarker of type 2 inflammation – Dupixent treatment also led to a significant 38% reduction in exacerbations compared to placebo at 52 weeks (p=0.005). In this subgroup  Dupixent also led to an improvement in lung function of 232 mL versus 108 mL for placebo at 12 weeks (p=0.002) that was sustained at 52 weeks with an improvement in lung function of 247 mL versus 120 mL for placebo (p=0.003).The safety results were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. Overall rates of adverse events (AEs) were 77% for Dupixent and 76% for placebo. AEs more commonly observed with Dupixent compared to placebo included headache (8.1% Dupixent  6.8% placebo)  diarrhea (5.3% Dupixent  3.6% placebo) and back pain (5.1% Dupixent  3.4% placebo). AEs more commonly observed with placebo compared to Dupixent included upper respiratory tract infection (9.8% placebo  7.9% Dupixent)  hypertension (6.0% placebo  3.6% Dupixent) and COVID-19 (5.7% placebo  4.1% Dupixent). AEs leading to deaths were balanced between the two arms (1.7% placebo  1.5% Dupixent).The second  replicate Phase 3 trial of Dupixent in COPD with evidence of type 2 inflammation (NOTUS) is ongoing  with data expected in 2024. The safety and efficacy of Dupixent in COPD are currently under clinical investigation and have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority. Sanofi and Regeneron look forward to discussing the BOREAS data with regulators.About the Dupixent COPD Phase 3 Trial ProgramBOREAS is one of two pivotal trials in the Dupixent COPD program. The randomized  Phase 3  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in 939 adults who were current or former smokers aged 40 to 80 years with moderate-to-severe COPD. All patients in the trial had evidence of type 2 inflammation  as measured by blood eosinophils ≥300 cells/µL. Patents with a diagnosis or history of asthma were excluded from the trial. During the 52-week treatment period  patients received Dupixent or placebo every two weeks added to a maximal standard-of-care inhaled triple therapy of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)  long-acting beta agonists  and long-acting muscarinic antagonists. Double maintenance therapy was allowed if ICS was contraindicated.The primary endpoint evaluated the annualized rate of acute moderate or severe COPD exacerbations. Moderate exacerbations were defined as those requiring systemic steroids and/or antibiotics. Severe exacerbations were defined as those: requiring hospitalization; requiring more than a day of observation in an emergency department or urgent care facility; or resulting in death.Key secondary and other hierarchy endpoints included:Change from baseline in lung function (assessed by pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume over one second [FEV1]) at 12 and 52 weeks in both the overall population and those with FeNO ≥ 20 ppb.Change from baseline at 52 weeks in St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score compared to placebo (scale from 0-100).Change from baseline at 52 weeks in the Evaluating Respiratory Symptoms in COPD (E-RS: COPD) scale score (scale from 0-40).The annualized rate of acute moderate or severe COPD exacerbations in patients with FeNO ≥ 20 ppb.About Sanofi and Regeneron’s COPD Clinical Research ProgramSanofi and Regeneron are motivated to transform the treatment paradigm of COPD by examining the role different types of inflammation play in the disease progression through the investigation of two potentially first-in-class biologics  Dupixent and itepekimab.Dupixent inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and the program focuses on a specific population of people with evidence of type 2 inflammation. Itepekimab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits interleukin-33 (IL-33)  an initiator and amplifier of broad inflammation in COPD. Across both programs  four Phase 3 trials are ongoing and designed to inform next-generation treatments for people with COPD who might not have other options.Itepekimab is currently under clinical investigation and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.About DupixentDupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent  such as atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) and prurigo nodularis.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP  EoE or prurigo nodularis in different age populations.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today presented positive Phase 3 results evaluating the investigational use of Dupixent® (dupilumab) compared to placebo in adults currently on maximal standard-of-care inhaled therapy (triple therapy) with uncontrolled chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and evidence of type 2 inflammation. The Dupixent Phase 3 results were presented in the 2023 American Thoracic Society (ATS) International Conference session “New England Journal of Medicine and JAMA. Discussion on the Edge: Reports of Recently Published Pulmonary Research” and simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). These results will also be presented in the “Breaking News: Clinical Trial Results in Pulmonary Medicine” session on May 22.“I've seen patients with uncontrolled chronic obstructive pulmonary disease struggle for far too long with the debilitating symptoms of this progressive disease – with limited  incremental improvement on current treatment options ” said Surya Bhatt  M.D.  MSPH  Associate Professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham Division of Pulmonary  Allergy  and Critical Care Medicine  and a co-principal investigator of the trial. “This trial showed that dupilumab has the potential to impact the vicious cycle of exacerbations and lung function decline in patients with uncontrolled COPD with type 2 inflammation  and significantly improve respiratory symptoms. Dupilumab also helped improve health-related quality of life measures  which  from my years of experience as a physician  are just as meaningful for patients as being able to breathe easier.”COPD is a life-threatening respiratory disease that damages the lungs and causes progressive lung function decline. Symptoms include persistent cough and breathlessness that may not only impair the ability to perform routine daily activities  but can also lead to anxiety  depression and sleep disturbances. COPD is also associated with a significant health and economic burden due to recurrent acute exacerbations that require systemic corticosteroid treatment and/or lead to hospitalization or even death.

The randomized  Phase 3  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in 939 adults who were current or former smokers aged 40 to 80 years with moderate-to-severe COPD. All patients in the trial had evidence of type 2 inflammation  as measured by blood eosinophils ≥300 cells/µL. Patents with a diagnosis or history of asthma were excluded from the trial. During the 52-week treatment period  patients received Dupixent or placebo every two weeks added to a maximal standard-of-care inhaled triple therapy of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)  long-acting beta agonists (LABA)  and long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA). Double maintenance therapy  which included LABA and LAMA  was allowed if ICS was contraindicated.The primary endpoint evaluated the annualized rate of acute moderate or severe COPD exacerbations. Moderate exacerbations were defined as those requiring systemic steroids and/or antibiotics. Severe exacerbations were defined as those: requiring hospitalization; requiring more than a day of observation in an emergency department or urgent care facility; or resulting in death.Key secondary and other hierarchy endpoints included:Change from baseline in lung function (assessed by pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume over one second [FEV 1 ]) at 12 and 52 weeks in both the overall population and those with FeNO ≥ 20 ppb.]) at 12 and 52 weeks in both the overall population and those with FeNO ≥ 20 ppb.

Dupixent is currently approved for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in Europe  the U.S. and Japan. More than 600 000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create a substantial proportion of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Dupixent  Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent® (alirocumab)  Kevzara® (sarilumab)  Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb® (atoltivimab  maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including pediatric EoE  chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritus of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation and bullous pemphigoid.
