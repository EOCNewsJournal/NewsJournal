With this collaboration with Symphony  the offering will provide clients with the ability to resolve breaks faster under compressed settlement timeframes  which the pair said would be of “paramount importance” during the T+1 settlement migration.Empirically  the interoperability of the systems means that users share a live  automatically synchronised view  of the trade exception or settlement issues.Philip Slavin  chief executive of Taskize  said: “For too long  operations teams and their colleagues and counterparts on the trading desk have been restricted in their communication by outdated manual processes and an overreliance on phone and email”. He added that this development would allow both front and back-office teams more time and increase their capacity to focus on other value-add tasks.The integration – announced at Symphony Innovate London – allows users to remain working on their platforms without the need to copy and paste  and reduces the need for phone calls and emails  according to the businesses.Brad Levy  chief executive of Symphony commented that “it’s important to create integrations to automate common tasks and processes that ultimately free up time and reduce risk”.,neutral,0.15,0.85,0.0,mixed,0.19,0.23,0.58,True,English,"['software offerings', 'post-trade landscape', 'Symphony', 'Euroclear', 'Taskize', 'other value-add tasks', 'T+1 settlement migration', 'outdated manual processes', 'Symphony Innovate London', 'front office users', 'common tasks', 'settlement problems', 'settlement date', 'settlement timeframes', 'settlement issues', 'Markets’ infrastructure', 'technology platform', 'workflow platform', 'post-trade operations', 'operations teams', 'paramount importance', 'synchronised view', 'trade exception', 'Philip Slavin', 'chief executive', 'trading desk', 'back-office teams', 'Brad Levy', 'real-time collaboration', 'phone calls', 'Euroclear', 'Taskize', 'clients', 'matching', 'offering', 'ability', 'breaks', 'compressed', 'pair', 'systems', 'colleagues', 'counterparts', 'communication', 'overreliance', 'email', 'development', 'capacity', 'integration', 'platforms', 'need', 'businesses', 'risk']",2023-05-23,2023-05-23,thetradenews.com

Össur's mission is to improve the mobility of our end-users so they can live their Life Without Limitations®. The Company is headquartered in Iceland and owns and operates subsidiaries in multiple countries around the world. The Company sells its products worldwide  but its principal market are North America and Europe. The Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company as at and for the year ended 31 December 2022 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as ""the Company"" or ""Össur""). Össur's Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union and additional requirements in the Icelandic Financial Statement Act no. 3/2006. Operations in 2022 The total Net sales of the Company amounted to USD 718.6 million (2021: USD 718.7 million). Organic local currency sales increase was 4%. Net profit amounted to USD 43.2 million (2021: USD 65.7 million). Diluted earnings per share amounted to US cents 10.3 (2021: US cents 15.5). Earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) amounted to USD 114.2 million and 16% of sales (2021: USD 149.0 million  21%) and EBITDA before special items amounted to 128.2 million and 18% of sales (2021: USD 149.0 million  21%). The total assets of the Company amounted to USD 1 325.4 million at year end (2021: USD 1 246.9 million)  total liabilities were USD 689.9 million (2021: USD 620.3 million) and total equity was USD 635.5 million (2021: USD 626.6 million).

Information regarding salaries and salary related expenses can be found in note 6. Despite various challenges in 2022  Össur managed to grow the business across all markets and business segments. The USD strengthened considerably during the year against most currencies and affected reported sales negatively in 2022 by USD 47 Million or 7% compared to prior year. Sales growth in Americas and EMEA were particularly affected by the discontinuation of the outsourcing contract with the Department of Defense (DOD) in the US and the continuous suspension of sales to Russia due to the ongoing war. Sales to Russia amounted to around 1% of total sales in FY 2021. Össur continues to provide humanitarian aid in the form of donated products and clinical expertise to medical professionals in Ukraine. Supply chain challenges continue to have a short-term negative effect on productivity but sourcing of raw materials and components has improved during the year. Higher freight cost and inflation in raw material prices increased cost of goods sold by USD 13 million in 2022 from pre- pandemic levels in 2019 and USD 4 million from 2021. Management estimates that most of this increase in cost of goods sold is temporary in nature. In Q3 2022  Össur made organizational changes and initiated cost savings to support further growth and profitability and identified opportunities to increase efficiency by consolidating and simplifying operations to better leverage key strategic locations. Total annual cost savings amount to USD 15 million and are expected to materialize from the beginning of 2023. One-time restructuring cost in connection to organizational changes and cost savings initiatives were a large driver of higher OPEX in the year. 1 Consolidated Financial Statements Statement by the Board of Directors and President and CEO 0 Shareholders and share price Össur's shares are admitted to trading on the Nasdaq Copenhagen stock exchange.

All indices in the suite exclude companies involved in activities assessed to be causing significant harm to biodiversity or reducing the biodiversity footprint. They also enhance alignment with biodiversity-oriented U.N. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)  such as life below water and life on land. At the same time  the index methodology targets an aggregate reduction in carbon intensity of at least 30 percent across the included constituents.In addition to the baseline family  the suite also includes a Biodiversity Leaders family which consists solely of companies deriving at least 20 percent of their revenues from activities that are deemed to make a positive net contribution to the SDGs. These activities include preservation of marine ecosystems and sustainable agriculture and forestry.""Biodiversity is one of the paramount themes of our age and calls for investors to understand and address its associated risks in their investment portfolios "" said Axel Lomholt  Chief Product Officer for Indices & Benchmarks at STOXX. ""This launch comes as global investors are urged by some to account for and price nature into their sustainable investment strategies  and we are confident that the unique combination of our high-quality STOXX index suite  together with ISS ESG's rigorous data sets  will prove valuable in enabling investors to align with their biodiversity objectives.""Each new index family uses a granular index construction methodology  built on ISS ESG's extensive datasets and a three-part framework to select index constituents based upon an avoid  minimize and enable approach: avoid companies involved in activities causing harm to biodiversity; minimize exposure to companies with negative impacts on biodiversity; and capture companies enabling positive impact on biodiversity through scoring high on biodiversity solutions. Importantly  this framework goes beyond simple exclusion criteria  positively screening for companies with low negative impact on biodiversity and those companies actively enabling the planet's biodiversity – in line with COP15 goals.""Investor focus on managing biodiversity impact has the potential to become as significant and enduring as the current focus on climate change "" said Lorraine Kelly  Global Head of Investment Stewardship at ISS.

One of those initiatives with Micron envisages a plant to produce cutting-edge extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography technology in Hiroshima.Bipartisan support in the US legislature resulted in the CHIPS and Science Act in 2022  meant to boost American semiconductor R&D as well as production. The Act incentivizes leading American chip-design firms like Qualcomm to manufacture their chips in the US. It established a coordinated permitting mechanism balancing environmental  commercial and tax considerations supported by Federal subsidies and guarantees. Like the US moon project in the 1960s  the Act sets up grand challenges to build the first “zettascale"" supercomputer  which would operate 1 000 times faster than the fastest supercomputers available today. The CHIPS Act provides $53 billion  $39 billion of which is for manufacturing and $13 billion for R&D and workforce development.Alarmed by quick developments  the EU has announced a draft chips act which seeks to create a state-of-the-art European chip ecosystem for R&D  design  manufacturing  packaging and testing. Europe has one major advantage in that the world’s leading photo-lithographic company  ASML  which uses EUV technology to build the super complex machines that are fundamental to the mass production of chips  is based in Amsterdam and listed on Euronext (as well as on Nasdaq).India’s Semiconductor Mission (ISM) aims to build a vibrant semiconductor and display ecosystem to enable India’s emergence as a global hub for electronics manufacturing and design. India’s production linked incentive scheme (PLI) has catalysed fast movement in the assembly of some high-end mobile phones. Much progress remains to be made in the earlier parts of the R&D  design and manufacturing stages and the broadening of assembly lines to servers  telecom boards and laptops.The flurry of activity and the urgency of the efforts is  of course  arising because of extreme uncertainty around China’s actions over Taiwan  which is home to TSMC  the maker of a significant majority of the world’s most advanced computer chips. TSMC is already building a facility in Arizona  US  and has been under pressure to build in Europe  Singapore and on the Chinese mainland as well.Paradoxically  as TSMC builds outside its home base in Taiwan  it risks ceding the country’s ‘silicon shield’  increasing the probability of Chinese action. China has also sharpened its semiconductor strategy by focusing its $143 billion five-year plan on advanced manufacturing at a few companies like SMIC and Huawei.The G-7 meeting just concluded in Hiroshima  Japan  has euphemistically picked the word “de-risking"" over “decoupling"". The G-7 was joined by India  Indonesia  Vietnam  Brazil and the tiny island of Comoros. Exactly how countries on either side of the tech divide will strike a balance between geopolitical considerations and economic interests is unclear. While the US appears to be on a confrontational path with China  Japan  the EU and South Korea seek to walk a fine line between the two considerations. The cosy equilibrium in the semiconductor sector that the world had achieved over the last four decades is being subjected to rude change.In an epic book called Chip War: The Fight for the World’s Most Critical Technology  Chris Miller traces the history of the semiconductor industry and the deep links between its origins in the US and its evolution into a global supply chain that is now being threatened. Korea produces 44% of all memory chips and 8% of all processor chips  Japan produces 17% of all chips  China produces 15% of chips (though currently low end) and Taiwan produces 41% of all processor chips and 90% of the most advanced chips. This geographic concentration around the South China Sea  is far from ideal for a world that is on the verge of a ‘decoupling’.This is not a ‘war’ that India can swing both ways on. At the same time  given the degree of catch-up required and the huge amount of capital needed for fabrication  India faces a very challenging path ahead in this field. Vedanta and Foxconn have announced a partnership to build a chip manufacturing plant (or a ‘fab’). This fab aims to produce 40 nanometre (nm) and 28nm chips. While such chips are still in widespread use  the cutting edge of technology today at TSMC or Samsung is 2-3nm. TSMC first produced 28nm chips back in 2011. Notwithstanding the significant challenges in fabrication  India’s prospects in packaging  assembly and design are much better  since lead times are shorter and capital requirements lower. It is here that India must focus its incentives and workforce development.P.S: “In a world that combines twin threats of nuclear weapons and artificial intelligence  the US and China represent the greatest dangers to peace "" said 100-year-old American diplomat Henry Kissinger.Narayan Ramachandran is chairman  InKlude Labs.

FY22 also saw Pharnext strengthen its ties with Neovacs (following a strategic €20.7m debt funding agreement in September 2022 and a €24m debt commitment in January 2023)  culminating in a revised legal framework with Neovacs' CEO Hugo Brugière at the helm. The FY22 operating costs were higher than our estimates  particularly admin expenses (€7.4m versus our estimate of €5.2m)  resulting in an EBITDA loss of €27.2m. The end-FY22 gross cash balance was €0.6m  which should be supported by the €4m available for drawdown from the original Neovacs agreement in 2023. We estimate that Pharnext will need to raise another €22m in FY23 (potentially from the January Neovacs facility). Our revised valuation is €213.9m (from €217m). Our per-share valuation re-adjusts to €309.6/share based on the post 1:10 000 consolidation shares outstanding.”The market value of Pharnext (as of May 19  2023) is €0.4m[1] for a last share price of €0.652.The full research note explains the basis of the valuation  together with the assumptions and risks  and is available on Pharnext's and Edison's websites.About PharnextPharnext is an advanced clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapies for neurodegenerative diseases currently without satisfactory therapeutic solutions. Pharnext has a first-in-class drug candidate  PXT3003  in development for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A)  a rare  debilitating  inherited peripheral neuropathy. PXT3003 benefits from orphan drug status in Europe and the United States. In 2018  PXT3003 completed a Phase III clinical trial  the PLEO-CMT trial  with encouraging topline results. This trial was followed by an open-label extension study  the PLEO-CMT-FU trial  with 120 patients continuing treatment with PXT3003. Long-term data suggests a sustained benefit  safety  and efficacy  after 5 years of total trial time. An international pivotal Phase III study of PXT3003  the PREMIER trial  is currently ongoing with 387 CMT1A patients enrolled. PREMIER topline results are expected in Q4 2023.

The Company is pleased to report a strong performance in digital revenue across Belgium  Serbia  and the Nordic countries  despite the negative impact of the SEK-EUR exchange rate on revenue in Sweden. These regions have consistently delivered positive results. In terms of geographical distribution  the top five countries for digital processing revenue remain consistent. Belgium leads the way with 22%  followed by Sweden with 19%  The Netherlands with 13%  Serbia with 8%  and Lithuania with 7%. Importantly  there were no substantial deviations from the budget for the countries where we are active  indicating stable and aligned performance across operations.The revenue from postage & parcel optimisation  linked to the acquired business in the Scandinavian countries  showed a decline of 10 3% in revenue. This is largely attributed to the impact of the SEK-EURO exchange rate change.During the first three months of the year  the project-based business is typically limited  a pattern observed in the previous years and also in 2023. The absolute differences compared to the previous year remained minimal.Notably  97% of the Group’s revenue was recurring  highlighting the strong foundation of its business and the stability provided by the Group’s loyal customer base. Unifiedpost Group continues to navigate the business landscape with resilience and adaptability  focusing on sustained growth and the development of innovative solutions that meet the evolving needs of the customers.Unifiedpost Group achieved an average revenue per user (ARPU) of €23 5 in the first quarter  reflecting the ongoing growth and diversification of the digital processing business. The ARPU level is lower compared to the previous quarter (€27 3) primarily due to the absence of license revenue in the first quarter of this year  which was included in Q4 2022 with the closure of a large deal with ECMA (the French accountants federation). An increasing revenue contribution from Unifiedpost's SME business has also influenced the overall ARPU. This segment of the business typically exhibits a structurally lower ARPU  which results from its focus on serving a broader customer base and offering competitive pricing tailored to the needs of small and medium-sized enterprises.Customer growth and network expansion fuelling Europe's digital transformationUnifiedpost continues to witness remarkable growth in its customer base  reaching new heights in the first quarter of 2023. The number of customers surged to 1.133.706  reflecting a significant increase compared to the end of the previous year. Paying customers also showed a positive trajectory  with 473.679 businesses choosing Unifiedpost's services  highlighting the value and trust placed in the Unifiedpost solutions. Moreover  the company experienced a notable expansion in the number of customers paid by third parties  reaching 660.027  further solidifying Unifiedpost's position as a preferred partner for businesses across various industries.Unifiedpost's commitment to building a robust business network remains unwavering  as the total number of companies in the network surpassed 2 million. This extensive network represents a substantial portion of businesses in Europe  estimated to encompass approximately 8% of the market.Within the core SME product  Banqup  the growth trajectory continues. The number of Banqup customers grew strongly to 143.902  indicating a continued surge in adoption and showcasing the platform's appeal among SMEs. Notably  organic growth in new subscriptions contributed significantly to this achievement  with 19.569 new subscriptions added during the first quarter alone.Unifiedpost's presence in key markets is thriving  as evidenced by the increasing number of Banqup customers in Belgium (Billtobox) and France (JeFacture). In Belgium  the Banqup customer base reached an impressive 45.359  while in France  the number rose to11.973 at the end of the first quarter. These figures demonstrate the growing recognition and adoption of Unifiedpost's services  setting the stage for accelerated growth in the coming periods  particularly in the French market where e-invoicing will be mandatory as from 07/2024.Unifiedpost remains dedicated to empowering businesses throughout Europe to embrace digitalisation  compliance  and streamlined reporting.

This allows BioSenic to distinguish a group of patients  representing about one third of the total patients  who show a pain-relieving effect of JTA-004 not only superior to placebo but also to the active comparator. This new post-hoc analysis changes the therapeutic profile of the molecule and potentially allows for the possibility of stratifying patients for a new  optimized Phase III clinical study.In March 2023  BioSenic published new data providing additional details about the mechanism of action of its lead API arsenic trioxide (ATO) to prevent autoimmune diseases has now been published in a peer-reviewed paper (Frontiers in Immunology). This new data shows that combination of ATO with copper salts can allow BioSenic to work towards reducing the dosage of ATO in future trials overall and maintain efficacy. This new formulation data has been completed following pre-clinical activities and does not constitute data validated through clinical trial.In April 2023  BioSenic received a key European patent from EPO  for further therapeutic development in cancer  infectious and immune diseases. The patent covers the therapeutic use of a new composite formulation of anti-inflammatory compounds with unique advantages. This new formulation lowers the dosage of arsenic trioxide by combining it with copper salts to maintain therapeutic efficacy  with the potential of administration through multiple routes  including intravenous  oral and other novel routes of administration.In May 2023  BioSenic identified key biomarkers for cGvHD and submitted patent to EPO. The technology covered by the patent applies to a method and kit for diagnosing and monitoring cGvHD in an individual who has undergone an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The patent describes biomarkers to be used to determine if the condition of a patient worsens or improves following standard or new treatments for cGvHD. This international patent could allow the development of an industrial biomarker analysis kit which could generate a turnover of 30 to 40 million euros globally.In May 2023  BioSenic announced it reacquired global IP rights for JTA-004 and provided update on JTA-004 development. BioSenic is looking for an industry partner to submit its results to the regulatory bodies in order to find the best and fastest way to obtain a Marketing Authorization (MA). This partnership will jointly conduct a small-scale additional Phase III trial targeting the most severe form of knee OA  prior to the MA with global regulators. The Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) could be submitted as soon as three years after the start of the Phase III trial  and as a result JTA could reach the market in 2027.Financial highlightsNet cash at the end of March 2023 amounted to €1.45 million (1) .. Disciplined cost and cash management will remain a key priority. The operating cash burn for the full year 2023 is in the range of €8-10 million and a financing cash burn of approximately EUR 1.7 million. The situation will be actively and closely monitored. BioSenic anticipates having sufficient cash to carry out its business objectives until end of June 2023  assuming (amongst other) issuance of the eighth tranche of the Convertible Bonds and the renegotiation of the terms of the ongoing loans that will otherwise fall due in June 2023.Outlook for the remainder of 2023In the ongoing Phase IIb ALLOB clinical study in difficult tibial fractures  BioSenic expects to report topline results by July/August 2023. The company will provide updates subsequently.BioSenic has started preliminary discussions with Pregene  LinkHealth and other potential partners to reach an agreement for the development and commercialization of ALLOB.In March 2023  BioSenic has obtained new statistical analysis results from the JTA-004 Phase III clinical trial data. BioSenic  which does not intend to allocate R&D resources to support the clinical development of JTA-004  is seeking to collaborate with existing and potential partners to explore options for the future development of JTA-004 based on this new post-hoc analysis.The Medsenic Phase II clinical study with arsenic trioxide in the first-line treatment of cGvHD has been completed and provided positive results. A Phase III study with oral arsenic trioxide in the first-line treatment of cGvHD  for which Medsenic received positive pre-IND response from the FDA  is currently anticipated to start in 2023. A Phase IIa clinical trial for systemic lupus erythematosus (""SLE"") had previously established safety for the patient and efficacy on the course of the autoimmune disease. Positive preclinical work gives good grounds for a Phase II clinical trial on systemic sclerosis (""SSc""). Phase IIb clinical trials for SLE and SSc are in the planning stage with the protocols for both studies being ready.BioSenic Group  however  expects to use the existing cash and the proceeds of anticipated future fundraisings (via shares or (convertible) bonds) in priority for achieving the Phase IIb clinical trial for ALLOB and for progressing the Phase III clinical trial in cGvHD. As a result  it will only be possible to start the SLE and SSc Phase IIb clinical trials if the BioSenic Group succeeds in concluding a strong partnership with a biopharmaceutical company or if it manages to successfully out-license some of its technology. The start of SLE and SSc Phase II clinical trials is therefore not envisioned before 2024.(1) Unaudited numbersAbout BioSenicBioSenic is a leading biotech company specializing in the development of clinical assets issued from: (i)  the allogeneic cell therapy platform ALLOB and (ii) the Arsenic TriOxide (ATO) platform. Key target indications for the platforms include Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD)  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) and high-risk tibial fractures.Following the merger in October 2022  BioSenic combines the strategic positionings and strengths of Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics. The merger also enables Biosenic to add to its innovative cell therapy platform and strong IP for tissue repair protection with an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/OATO.BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About BioSenic technology platformsBioSenic’s technology is based on two main platforms:1) The allogeneic cell and gene therapy platform  developed by BioSenic with differentiated bone marrow sourced Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) that can be stored at the point of use in hospitals. Its current investigational medicinal product  ALLOB  represents a unique  proprietary approach to organ repair and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells on the site of injury after a single local injection. These cells are produced via a BioSenic's scalable manufacturing process. Following the CTA approval by regulatory authorities in Europe  BioSenic has initiated patient recruitment for the Phase IIb clinical trial with ALLOB in patients with difficult tibial fractures  using its optimized production process. ALLOB is currently being evaluated in a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase IIb study in patients with high-risk tibial fractures  using its optimized production process  after a successful first safety and efficacy study (Phase 1/2a) on fractured long bones  with late delayed union. The patient recruitment has been halted late February 2023 with 57 patients and the new rules permitted for statistical analysis should allow BioSenic to get the main results of this trial much earlier than anticipated in the original protocol  since they are expected by mid-2023.2) The Arsenic TriOxide (ATO) platform developed by Medsenic. The immunomodulatory properties of ATO have demonstrated a double basic effect on cells of the immune system. The first effect is the increase of the cell oxidative stress in activated B  T or other cells of the innate/adaptative immune system to the point they will enter a cell death program (apoptosis) and be eliminated. The second effect is potent immunomodulatory properties on several pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in inflammatory or autoimmune cell pathways. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. GvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). GvHD is primarily mediated by the transplanted immune system that can lead to severe multiorgan damage. Medsenic had been successful in a Phase II trial with its intravenous formulation  allowing arsenic trioxide to be granted an orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA and is heading towards an international Phase III confirmatory study  with a new  IP protected  oral (OATO) formulation. Moderate to Severe forms of Systemic Lupus erythematosus (SLE) is another selected target  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastro-intestinal tract) in a Phase IIa study.Systemic Sclerosis is  in addition  part of the clinical pipeline of BioSenic. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive. This gives good grounds to launch a Phase II clinical protocol for this serious disease that badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and with no actual current effective treatment.In addition  BioSenic is developing an off-the-shelf next-generation improved viscosupplement  JTA-004  consisting of a unique combination of plasma proteins  hyaluronic acid - a natural component of knee synovial fluid  and a fast-acting analgesic. JTA-004 intends to provide added lubrication and protection to the cartilage of the arthritic joint and to alleviate osteoarthritic pain (OA) and inflammation. In March 2023  after the identification of new OA subtypes  BioSenic delivered a new post-hoc analysis of its Phase III JTA-004 trial on knee OA with positive action on the most severely affected patient population. This new post-hoc analysis changes the therapeutic profile of the molecule and potentially allows for the possibility of stratifying patients for a new  optimized Phase III clinical study. BioSenic  which does not intend to allocate R&D resources to support the clinical development of JTA-004 and will continue to focus its R&D activities on the development of its autoimmune (ATO) and cell therapy (ALLOB) platforms  is now seeking to collaborate with existing and potential partners to explore options for the future development of JTA-004 based on this new post-hoc analysis.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAPr.

Key highlights Strengthening of Executive Committee and Board of Directors with the appointments of Dr Carole Nicco as Chief Scientific Officer  Dr Lieven Huysse as Chief Medical Officer and Yves Sagot as Independent Director.In February 2023  BioSenic announced it received EUR 1 million from Pregene in accordance with the terminated license agreement.In February 2023  BioSenic announced an optimization its ongoing Phase IIb clinical trial with its allogeneic bone cell therapy product  ALLOB and completion of patient recruitment.In March 2023  BioSenic announced that it has used the statistical analysis capabilities of Artialis to study the results of the Phase III JTA-004 trial in the subset of patients with the most painful and inflammatory form of knee osteoarthritis (OA). This allows BioSenic to distinguish a group of patients  representing about one third of the total patients  who show a pain-relieving effect of JTA-004 not only superior to placebo but also to the active comparator. This new post-hoc analysis changes the therapeutic profile of the molecule and potentially allows for the possibility of stratifying patients for a new  optimized Phase III clinical study.In March 2023  BioSenic published new data providing additional details about the mechanism of action of its lead API arsenic trioxide (ATO) to prevent autoimmune diseases has now been published in a peer-reviewed paper (Frontiers in Immunology). This new data shows that combination of ATO with copper salts can allow BioSenic to work towards reducing the dosage of ATO in future trials overall and maintain efficacy. This new formulation data has been completed following pre-clinical activities and does not constitute data validated through clinical trial.In April 2023  BioSenic received a key European patent from EPO  for further therapeutic development in cancer  infectious and immune diseases. The patent covers the therapeutic use of a new composite formulation of anti-inflammatory compounds with unique advantages. This new formulation lowers the dosage of arsenic trioxide by combining it with copper salts to maintain therapeutic efficacy  with the potential of administration through multiple routes  including intravenous  oral and other novel routes of administration.In May 2023  BioSenic identified key biomarkers for cGvHD and submitted patent to EPO. The technology covered by the patent applies to a method and kit for diagnosing and monitoring cGvHD in an individual who has undergone an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The patent describes biomarkers to be used to determine if the condition of a patient worsens or improves following standard or new treatments for cGvHD. This international patent could allow the development of an industrial biomarker analysis kit which could generate a turnover of 30 to 40 million euros globally.In May 2023  BioSenic announced it reacquired global IP rights for JTA-004 and provided update on JTA-004 development. BioSenic is looking for an industry partner to submit its results to the regulatory bodies in order to find the best and fastest way to obtain a Marketing Authorization (MA). This partnership will jointly conduct a small-scale additional Phase III trial targeting the most severe form of knee OA  prior to the MA with global regulators. The Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) could be submitted as soon as three years after the start of the Phase III trial  and as a result JTA could reach the market in 2027.Financial highlights Net cash at the end of March 2023 amounted to €1.45 million (1) .. Disciplined cost and cash management will remain a key priority. The operating cash burn for the full year 2023 is in the range of €8-10 million and a financing cash burn of approximately EUR 1.7 million. The situation will be actively and closely monitored. BioSenic anticipates having sufficient cash to carry out its business objectives until end of June 2023  assuming (amongst other) issuance of the eighth tranche of the Convertible Bonds and the renegotiation of the terms of the ongoing loans that will otherwise fall due in June 2023. Outlook for the remainder of 2023 In the ongoing Phase IIb ALLOB clinical study in difficult tibial fractures  BioSenic expects to report topline results by July/August 2023. The company will provide updates subsequently.BioSenic has started preliminary discussions with Pregene  LinkHealth and other potential partners to reach an agreement for the development and commercialization of ALLOB.In March 2023  BioSenic has obtained new statistical analysis results from the JTA-004 Phase III clinical trial data. BioSenic  which does not intend to allocate R&D resources to support the clinical development of JTA-004  is seeking to collaborate with existing and potential partners to explore options for the future development of JTA-004 based on this new post-hoc analysis.The Medsenic Phase II clinical study with arsenic trioxide in the first-line treatment of cGvHD has been completed and provided positive results. A Phase III study with oral arsenic trioxide in the first-line treatment of cGvHD  for which Medsenic received positive pre-IND response from the FDA  is currently anticipated to start in 2023. A Phase IIa clinical trial for systemic lupus erythematosus (""SLE"") had previously established safety for the patient and efficacy on the course of the autoimmune disease. Positive preclinical work gives good grounds for a Phase II clinical trial on systemic sclerosis (""SSc""). Phase IIb clinical trials for SLE and SSc are in the planning stage with the protocols for both studies being ready.BioSenic Group  however  expects to use the existing cash and the proceeds of anticipated future fundraisings (via shares or (convertible) bonds) in priority for achieving the Phase IIb clinical trial for ALLOB and for progressing the Phase III clinical trial in cGvHD. As a result  it will only be possible to start the SLE and SSc Phase IIb clinical trials if the BioSenic Group succeeds in concluding a strong partnership with a biopharmaceutical company or if it manages to successfully out-license some of its technology.

The permit area is home to the Barryroe undersea prospect  discovered in 2012  and tipped by the company to hold potentially billions of euro worth of oil and gas.Despite that promise Barryroe has struggled to turn the prospect into a reality and to secure financial backing to develop its plans.Barryroe Offshore had an 80pc stake in the prospect licence alongside partner Lansdowne Oil & Gas.Its statement on Friday Barryroe said it had been informed by letter that the partners had no rights over SEL1/11 after the minister found the applicant did not meet the criteria necessary to satisfy the terms of the legislation.Barryroe said the minister was not satisfied with the financial capability of the applicants. This assessment has concluded that from a technical perspective the Barryroe permit application was satisfactory  Barryroe said.The company said it is considering its response to the letter. That could include a legal challenge to the minister’s decision  including a potential judicial review.A judicial review can only challenge aspects of the decision-making process  not the decision itself.The department said in a statement to the Irish Independent that its decision followed extensive engagement over several years between the applicants and its Geoscience Regulation Office in relation to the application.“The assessment showed that the application did not meet the criteria necessary to satisfy the terms of the legislation and associated guidance. This includes the technical competence of the applicant and the financial resources available to it in order to undertake the work programme and any other commitments pursuant to the relevant petroleum authorisation ” it said.The department said the minister does not comment on individual regulatory decisions but it did say the decision in the Barryroe case was not linked to wider energy policies.“It should be noted that broader policy issues relating to  for example  the phasing out of fossil fuels or our security of energy supply  did not form part of the assessment process. As set out in the Programme for Government  holders of existing petroleum authorisations – such as the applicants in this case – were entitled to apply to progress to the next stage of the regulatory process ” the statement said.Shares in Barryroe Offshore are set to come under intense pressure today. The Euronext Dublin listed company is in a process of raising €20m from shareholders to bolster its financial standing after securing a €40m facility last year from shareholders led by billionaire Larry Goodman.The firm’s market capitalisation had fallen to €45m when the market closed before Friday’s update – around 10pc of its value back in 2012 after the Barryroe find.,negative,0.0,0.02,0.98,mixed,0.1,0.14,0.77,True,English,"['Barryroe offshore permit', 'Energy policy', 'Environment Department', 'reason', 'The Euronext Dublin listed company', 'Environment Minister Eamon Ryan', 'Wider policy issues', 'Geoscience Regulation Office', 'relevant petroleum authorisation', 'broader policy issues', 'existing petroleum authorisations', 'billionaire Larry Goodman', 'wider energy policies', 'individual regulatory decisions', 'stock market notice', 'potential judicial review', 'SEL1/11 licence area', 'Barryroe Offshore Energy', 'Barryroe undersea prospect', 'key exploration prospect', 'Barryroe permit application', 'energy supply', 'prospect licence', 'regulatory process', 'market capitalisation', 'exploration permit', 'Barryroe find', 'south-west coast', 'fossil fuels', 'Providence Resources', 'euro worth', 'financial backing', '80pc stake', 'financial capability', 'technical perspective', 'legal challenge', 'Irish Independent', 'extensive engagement', 'several years', 'associated guidance', 'technical competence', 'financial resources', 'other commitments', 'next stage', 'intense pressure', 'financial standing', '€40m facility', 'permit area', 'decision-making process', 'Barryroe case', 'Lansdowne Oil', 'work programme', 'assessment process', 'Friday', 'Ireland', 'moves', 'dependence', 'department', 'billions', 'gas', 'promise', 'reality', 'plans', 'partner', 'statement', 'letter', 'rights', 'applicant', 'criteria', 'terms', 'legislation', 'response', 'aspects', 'relation', 'order', 'example', 'phasing', 'security', 'Government', 'holders', 'progress', 'Shares', 'firm', 'update', '10pc', 'value']",2023-05-22,2023-05-23,independent.ie

It is a non-invasive diagnostic technology designed as an optimization of NIS4® technology  a blood-based panel currently used to detect at-risk NASH.In November 2021  NIS4® was recognized by the NIMBLE2 Initiative of the FNIH's3 Biomarkers Consortium as showing a unique performance in identifying patients with at-risk NASH.Data presented at the AASLD4 Liver Meeting® in October 2022 demonstrated the robust and improved clinical performance of NIS2+™ allowing an efficient identification of at-risk NASH  irrespective of patient characteristics such as age  sex and type 2 diabetes. It was also demonstrated that NIS2+™ is an effective screening tool for the enrollment of patients with at-risk NASH in clinical trials  reducing liver biopsy failure rates and associated costs without inflating the number of patients to screen.There is currently a high unmet medical need for an In Vitro Diagnostic (IVD) test to enable a non-invasive  accessible and rapid diagnostic that is an alternative to liver biopsy  improving overall clinical care and greatly reducing barriers to entry for innovative therapies. NIS2+™ is the only blood-based technology developed for the identification of at-risk NASH allowing it to be applied for large-scale use in clinical practice.Dr. Vlad Ratziu  Professor at Sorbonne University and Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital in Paris  France commented:""With NASH drugs potentially coming on the market in the very near future  there is an increasing and urgent need for patients and the healthcare system for a NASH diagnostic that is non-invasive  robust and cost-effective. By having both a diagnostic and therapeutic solution  physicians will be able to efficiently manage patients with progressive forms of NASH.""Stephen A. Harrison  Chairman and Founder for Pinnacle Clinical Research  Chairman and Co-Founder of Summit Clinical Research  USA and Visiting Professor of Hepatology at the Radcliffe Department of Medicine  University of Oxford  UK commented:""We are excited that the development and validation of NIS2+™ have been recognized by one of the leading medical journals. Thanks to such progression in patient management with the development of this next-generation technology  physicians can offer satisfactory solutions to patients suffering from at-risk NASH.""GENFIT continues to explore the possibility of obtaining regulatory approval and CE Certificates of Conformity  alone or with a development and commercial partner  to release an IVD test powered by NIS2+™ technology on the US and European markets.ABOUT GENFITGENFIT is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to improving the lives of patients with rare and severe liver diseases characterized by high unmet medical needs.

This system covers all operational aspects of Eurobio Scientific  in France  related to the processes and procedures that ensure the quality and performance of the PCR tests produced by the company  a mandatory prerequisite to comply with the new IVDR requirements.This ISO certification was obtained for ""in-vitro diagnostic devices: kits  reagents and control materials intended to be used to detect the presence of an infectious agent or exposure to such an agent  including sexually transmitted agents"". It therefore allows Eurobio Scientific to proceed sequentially with the new CE marking of its current infectious disease PCR tests  and to CE mark its future tests within the IVDR framework which now applies to all new in-vitro diagnostic medical devices.A critical know-howCE marking and ISO certification in France according to the new  more stringent European standards represent a fundamental step in the Group's development  as they complement the similar certification that its subsidiary  GenDx  was the first to obtain in the Netherlands. This step confirms the Group's strong regulatory expertise  which is becoming a major asset for successfully developing and marketing new diagnostic tests  regardless of their origin in Europe.With this now critical know-how  the Group demonstrates that it was able  in a very short time  to raise the quality requirements for its own products and successfully complete much more complex regulatory processes. Eurobio Scientific has thus built up a real high-value asset to ensure its future development.« Getting of our new IVDR certification as well as the IVDR CE marking of the first 3 tests in our EurobioPlex line  constitute the culmination of a process of strengthening our quality and regulatory system which had already been underway for several years. I would like to thank here our employees without whom this major step for Eurobio Scientific would not have been possible  especially since this qualification is also a strong signal that we send to our partners and customers regarding the quality of our teams and our products. » says Cathie Marsais  Vice President of Operations at Eurobio Scientific.Next financial meetingsAnnual Shareholders’ meeting: June 13  2023About Eurobio ScientificEurobio Scientific is a key player in the field of specialty in vitro diagnostics.
