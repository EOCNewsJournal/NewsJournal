All forms must be signed and should be returned together in the same envelope. The Form of Proxy must arrive at Neville Registrars Limited during usual business hours accompanied by any power of attorney or other written authority under which it is executed (if applicable)  or a certiﬁed copy of such power of authority  no later than 1:00 p.m. on 21 June 2023. In the case of joint holders  the signature of the holder whose name stands ﬁrst in the relevant Register of Members will suﬃce as the vote of such holders and shall be accepted to the exclusion of the votes of the other joint holders. The names of all joint holders should  however  be shown. CREST members should use the CREST electronic proxy appointment service and refer to notes 7-10 in relation to the submission of a proxy appointment via CREST. A corporation must execute the Form of Proxy under either its common seal or the hand of a duly authorised oﬃcer or attorney. The 'Vote withheld' option is to enable you to abstain on any particular resolution. Such a vote is not a vote in law and will not be counted in the votes 'For' and 'Against' a resolution. Shares held in uncertiﬁed form (i.e. in CREST) may be voted through the CREST Proxy Voting Service in accordance with the procedures set out in the CREST Manual. CREST personal members or other CREST sponsored embers  and those CREST members who have appointed a voting service provider(s)  should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s)  who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf. In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST service to be valid  the appropriate CREST message (a 'CREST Proxy Instruction') must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK & International Limited's speciﬁcations and must contain the information required for such instructions  as described in the CREST Manual. The message  regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or an amendment to the instruction given to a previously appointed proxy must  in order to be valid  be transmitted so as to be received by the Company's agent (ID: 7RA11) by the latest time(s) for receipt of proxy appointments speciﬁed in the Notice of AGM. For this purpose  the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Applications Host) from which the Company's agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. After this time any change of instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should be communicated to the appointee through other means. CREST members and  where applicable  their CREST sponsors or voting service providers should note that Euroclear UK & International Limited does not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or  if the CREST member is a CREST personal member or sponsored member or has appointed a voting service provider(s)  to procure that his ⧸ her CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection  CREST members and  where applicable  their CREST sponsors or voting service providers are referred  in particular  to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings. The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertiﬁcated Securities Regulations 2001.

25226,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/22/anthemis-targets-200m-for-new-fund-after-layoffs-and-terminating-spac/,Anthemis targets $200M for new fund after layoffs and canceled SPAC,Anthemis Group is trying to raise $200 million for a third fund  according to an SEC filing  as first reported by Axios. It has been in the market since last year and has so far secured commitments of just $36.4 million. The firm separately had to scrap plans…,Anthemis Group is trying to raise $200 million for a third fund  according to an SEC filing  as first reported by Axios. It has been in the market since last year and has so far secured commitments of just $36.4 million. The firm separately had to scrap plans to raise a SPAC late last month.Founded in 2010  London-based Anthemis is focused on financial technology (better known as fintech) — a sector which has been hard hit by the economic downturn and venture capital slowdown. The firm in late 2021 announced that it had raised $700 million in new funds in what a spokesperson described as “a collection of capital” it closed “across strategies” from its venture studio through to its venture growth fund. That collection of capital was dubbed Anthemis Venture Fund II.The firm previously raised $106 million in its first venture fund in March of 2018; Anthemis had said it has $1.5 billion in assets under management altogether.TechCrunch has reached out to Anthemis about its attempts to raise capital for its third fund  and its dissolved SPAC  but had not yet heard back at the time of writing.The new fundraising filing comes just months after Anthemis laid off 16 people  or 28% of its staff  as reported by TechCrunch in April. At that time  a spokesperson for London-based Anthemis told TechCrunch that the move was an effort “to better reflect current market conditions and to set up the business for future growth” against its “strategic priorities.”While we have seen some big funds raised in recent months  the market has tightened dramatically for other firms. Either way  Anthemis is not the only outfit to have had to retreat from SPAC plans. Many others  including Acorns  for example  opted to raise capital instead in 2022. For a while during the bull run  SPACs  also known as special purpose acquisition vehicles  were viewed as a good way for operators  as well as certain VC firms  to extend the amount of capital they could put to work. But they have plunged in popularity since 2022  after the SEC introduced proposed guidelines for SPACs  specifically around disclosures  marketing practices and third-party oversight.As TechCrunch’s Connie Loizos has previously reported  Senator Elizabeth Warren announced last year that she was planning a bill that targeted the SPAC industry. Called the “SPAC Accountability Act of 2022 ” the bill would expand the legal liability of parties involved in SPAC transactions  close loopholes that SPACs have “long exploited to make overblown projections” and lock in longer the investors sponsoring a deal.So far this year  Anthemis has publicly announced a few new investments. including: Flyby  Elevate (lead investor)  Greenspark and Agreena. It also announced a follow-on investment in Flock. The firm has also seen a couple of exits  including Power being acquired by Marqeta and Goji getting picked up by Euroclear. Other companies in its portfolio include social investment app eToro  investing and savings app Betterment and insurtech Vouch.Like a growing number of firms  Anthemis has also seen a couple of portfolio companies stumble over the last year. In November  controversy surrounding the sudden stepping down of three of Pipe’s co-founders  including its CEO  raised eyebrows. And more recently  LGBTQ+-focused digital bank Daylight was slammed with a lawsuit by three former employees “alleging age and wage discrimination  whistleblower retaliation  and fraud.”,negative,0.01,0.41,0.58,negative,0.0,0.08,0.92,True,English,"['new fund', 'Anthemis', 'layoffs', 'SPAC', 'special purpose acquisition vehicles', 'LGBTQ+-focused digital bank Daylight', 'Senator Elizabeth Warren', 'three former employees', 'first venture fund', 'new fundraising filing', 'current market conditions', 'social investment app', 'venture growth fund', 'venture capital slowdown', 'third fund', 'future growth', 'savings app', 'venture studio', 'new funds', 'new investments', 'SEC filing', 'last year', 'financial technology', 'economic downturn', 'strategic priorities', 'big funds', 'recent months', 'Many others', 'bull run', 'good way', 'marketing practices', 'third-party oversight', 'Connie Loizos', 'legal liability', 'close loopholes', 'overblown projections', 'lead investor', 'Other companies', 'insurtech Vouch', 'growing number', 'sudden stepping', 'wage discrimination', 'whistleblower retaliation', 'other firms', 'VC firms', 'SPAC industry', 'SPAC transactions', 'portfolio companies', 'Anthemis Group', 'London-based Anthemis', 'SPAC plans', 'Axios', 'commitments', 'fintech', 'sector', 'late', 'spokesperson', 'collection', 'strategies', 'March', 'assets', 'management', 'TechCrunch', 'attempts', 'time', 'writing', '16 people', 'staff', 'April', 'move', 'effort', 'business', 'outfit', 'Acorns', 'example', 'SPACs', 'operators', 'amount', 'popularity', 'guidelines', 'disclosures', 'bill', 'parties', 'investors', 'deal', 'Flyby', 'Elevate', 'Greenspark', 'Agreena', 'Flock', 'couple', 'exits', 'Power', 'Marqeta', 'Goji', 'Euroclear', 'investing', 'Betterment', 'November', 'controversy', 'Pipe', 'founders', 'CEO', 'eyebrows', 'lawsuit', 'fraud']",2023-05-22,2023-05-24,techcrunch.com

(CSE: AUOZ) (""Emperor"" or the ""Company"") is pleased to report the secondary listing of its common shares on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (""FSE"") under the trading symbol ""9NH"".CEO John Florek commented:""Trading on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange provides Emperor Metals with direct access to the European capital markets  presenting an excellent opportunity for the Company to enhance trading liquidity and facilitate investment by expanding our shareholder base. We are excited to offer European investors the chance to participate in our success and contribute to our growth.""The Frankfurt Stock Exchange (FSE) is one of the world's largest international trading centers for securities. Operated by the Deutsche Boerse AG  FSE is the largest of Germany's seven stock exchanges  and is responsible for approximately 90 percent of all securities traded in Germany. The FSE facilitates advanced electronic trading  settlement and information systems and enables cross-border trading for international investors.To help in this oversea market Emperor has teamed with CM-Equity AG which is a licensed and regulated investment and capital markets partner in Europe.About the Duquesne West Gold ProjectThe Duquesne West Gold Property is located 32 km northwest of the city of Rouyn-Noranda and 10 km east of the town of Duparquet. The property lies within the historic Duparquet gold mining camp in the southern portion of the Abitibi Greenstone Belt in the Superior Province.Under an Option Agreement  Emperor agreed to acquire a one hundred percent (100%) interest in a mineral claim package comprising 38 claims covering approximately 1 389 ha  located in the Duparquet Township of Quebec (the ""Duquesne West Property"") from Duparquet Assets Ltd.  a 50% owned subsidiary of Globex Mining Enterprises Inc. (GMX-TSX). For further information on the Duquesne West Property and Option Agreement  see Emperor's press release dated October 12  2022  available on SEDAR.The Property hosts a historical inferred mineral resource estimate of 727 000 ounces of gold at a grade of 5.42 g/t Au.1 2 The mineral resource estimate predates modern CIM guidelines and a Qualified Person on behalf of Emperor has not reviewed or verified the mineral resource estimate  therefore it is considered historical in nature and is reported solely to provide an indication of the magnitude of mineralization that could be present on the property. The gold system remains open for resource identification and expansion.Reinterpretation of the existing geological model was created using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. This model shows the opportunity for additional discovery of ounces by revealing gold trends unknown to previous workers and the potential to expand the resource along significant gold-endowed structural zones.1 Watts  Griffis  and McOuat Consulting Geologists and Engineers  Oct 20  2011  Technical Report and Mineral Resource Estimate Update for the Duquesne-Ottoman Property  Quebec  Canada for XMet Inc.2 Power-Fardy and Breede  2011. The Mineral Resource Estimate (MRE) constructed in 2011 is considered historical in nature as it was constructed prior to the most recent Canadian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy (CIM) standards (2014) and guidelines (2019) for mineral resources. In addition  the economic factors used to demonstrate reasonable prospects of eventual economic extraction for the MRE have changed since 2011. A qualified person has not done sufficient work to consider the MRE as a current MRE. Emperor is not treating the historical MRE as a current mineral resource. The reader is cautioned not to treat it  or any part of it  as a current mineral resource.QP DisclosureThe technical content for the Duquesne West Project in this news release has been reviewed and approved by John Florek  M.Sc.

Canton Network aims to overcome the limitations of public blockchains by providing a decentralized infrastructure that allows previously isolated systems in financial markets to interoperate while maintaining the necessary governance  privacy  permissioning and controls required for highly regulated industries.The participating organizations – which also include BNP Paribas BNPQY  Deutsche Börse Group and others – seek to unlock the potential of synchronized financial markets through the Canton Network. The network is designed to address the challenges faced by public blockchains  such as privacy and data control issues  scalability limitations and lack of interoperability. By connecting independent applications built with Digital Asset's smart-contract language called Daml  the Canton Network enables financial institutions to leverage the benefits of a global blockchain network while adhering to local regulatory requirements  as well.Yuval Rooz  co-founder and CEO at Digital Asset  emphasizes that the Canton Network represents a significant advancement for the blockchain space. It offers financial institutions the opportunity to leverage a global blockchain network while operating within the necessary regulatory frameworks  ensuring a safe and fair financial system. By enabling a safer and reconciliation-free environment  the network allows assets  data and cash to synchronize seamlessly across applications  creating opportunities for innovation and improving efficiency and risk management for financial institutions.One of the primary advantages of blockchain technology in regulated markets is the ability to ensure secure and transparent transactions while maintaining privacy and control over sensitive data. Blockchain's distributed ledger system allows for a tamper-proof record of transactions  enhancing trust and reducing the risk of fraud. Additionally  the use of smart contracts automates and streamlines processes  reducing operational costs and improving efficiency. The inclusion of Cboe  a leading global exchange operator  in the Canton Network highlights the potential impact of blockchain technology in transforming traditional financial markets.The Canton Network provides several use cases that demonstrate its capabilities. For instance  it enables the composition of a digital bond and a digital payment across separate applications into a single atomic transaction  guaranteeing simultaneous exchange without operational risk. It also facilitates the use of digital assets in collateralized financial transactions  such as repo or leveraged loan applications. These examples showcase the potential for the Canton Network to drive innovation and enable new product offerings while enhancing risk management and efficiency for financial institutions.The collaboration in creating the Canton Network involves several prominent industry players  including ASX  Broadridge BR  Capgemini  DRW  EquiLend  Microsoft MSFT  Moody's MCO  Paxos  and SBI Digital Asset Holdings. This diverse group of participants highlights the broad interest in the tech and the recognition of the need for a privacy-enabled interoperable blockchain network in the institutional asset space.Through their joint efforts  these organizations aim to unleash the full potential of blockchain technology  transforming the way financial markets operate and ensuring a more secure  efficient and transparent ecosystem for all participants.Featured photo by Shubham Dhage on Unsplash.This post contains sponsored advertising content.

(Euronext Amsterdam: ASM) will take its...,Almere  the Netherlands – Seoul  South KoreaMay 23  2023ASM International N.V. (Euronext Amsterdam: ASM) will take its symbolic first step in bringing its US$100 million multi-year investment in Hwaseong (Dongtan)  South Korea  to fruition  with the groundbreaking ceremony tomorrow on its expanded innovation and manufacturing center. The development follows the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding between ASM and the Ministry of Trade  Industry and Energy of the Republic of Korea (‘MOTIE’) earlier this year  around ASM’s intention to carry out this investment by 2025.The groundbreaking ceremony marks a strategic expansion for ASM and an important step in meeting the foreseen growing demand for semiconductors for the years to come. The investment will boost ASM’s research and product-development infrastructure  as well as adding more manufacturing capacity.With the investment  ASM is also committed to creating new job opportunities  especially in engineering  R&D and manufacturing that will contribute to training and workforce development in Korea.The milestone groundbreaking event will be attended by ASM’s CEO  Benjamin Loh and Pauline Van der Meer Mohr  Chair of the Supervisory Board. Guests include political dignitaries such as Kim Dong-Yeon  Governor of Gyeonggi Province  Wan Ki Kim  Deputy Minister for Trade & Investment  Jeong Myeong-Guen  Mayor of Hwaesong city  and Joanne Doornewaard  Ambassador of the Netherlands  alongside customers and business partners  and other ASM colleagues.Speaking ahead of the launch event  Benjamin Loh said this commitment to Hwaseong’s expansion was a bold step forward in ASM’s growth journey. “We couldn’t be happier that it’s taking place in Korea. Ever since we began our operations here back in 1989  we have been impressed by the potential  drive  and dedication of the Korean people. Right from the start  we sensed ASM would be able to do great things here.”Loh added that the investment in Hwaseong is about so much more than just expanding space. “It confirms our commitment to Korea  as well as our ambition to continue growing our business here. Going forward  we aim to enable the continued development of advanced technologies  which will also increase Korea’s ability to facilitate domestic world-class semiconductor innovation.”Hwaseong has been instrumental in ASM’s growth  with the facility delivering advanced R&D and technology for Korean and global customers. Korea is also the global center for ASM’s PEALD business. Technologies developed by ASM’s local R&D team have been at the heart of breakthrough innovations in the semiconductor industry  such as the ALD quad chamber module (QCM) architecture  the TENZA™ ALD for ultra-high aspect ratio (>100:1) gap-fill  and high-quality PEALD silicon and metal oxides and nitrides for spacers  liners  and other patterning applications.ASM currently has more than 450 people working at its Hwaseong facility  and the number is expected to rise as the facility expands. The current building measures just over 20 000 m2  and the new extension will add another 31 000 m2  spread across eight floors. The expansion will more than double the Hwaseong facility’s R&D area while manufacturing area will almost triple.YK Kim  Chairman of ASM Korea  said the expansion of ASM’s Hwaseong facility will create more space for the company’s fast-growing number of employees in Korea and reflects the country’s increasing importance to help the company meet growing global customer demand for advanced semiconductors in the years to come.“It’s an investment in people and in the semiconductor ecosystem in Korea. We wish to cooperate closely with the Korean government  customers  and suppliers to foster and accelerate Korea’s semiconductor industry growth ” Kim said. He expressed his gratitude for support shown to ASM by the government and industry partners in Korea  saying it has been “invaluable in bringing us to this moment”.About ASM InternationalASM International N.V.  headquartered in Almere  the Netherlands  and its subsidiaries design and manufacture equipment and process solutions to produce semiconductor devices for wafer processing  and have facilities in the United States  Europe  and Asia.

It is a non-invasive diagnostic technology designed as an optimization of NIS4® technology  a blood-based panel currently used to detect at-risk NASH.In November 2021  NIS4® was recognized by the NIMBLE2 Initiative of the FNIH’s3 Biomarkers Consortium as showing a unique performance in identifying patients with at-risk NASH.Data presented at the AASLD4 Liver Meeting® in October 2022 demonstrated the robust and improved clinical performance of NIS2+™ allowing an efficient identification of at-risk NASH  irrespective of patient characteristics such as age  sex and type 2 diabetes. It was also demonstrated that NIS2+™ is an effective screening tool for the enrollment of patients with at-risk NASH in clinical trials  reducing liver biopsy failure rates and associated costs without inflating the number of patients to screen.There is currently a high unmet medical need for an In Vitro Diagnostic (IVD) test to enable a non-invasive  accessible and rapid diagnostic that is an alternative to liver biopsy  improving overall clinical care and greatly reducing barriers to entry for innovative therapies. NIS2+™ is the only blood-based technology developed for the identification of at-risk NASH allowing it to be applied for large-scale use in clinical practice.Dr. Vlad Ratziu  Professor at Sorbonne University and Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital in Paris  France commented:“With NASH drugs potentially coming on the market in the very near future  there is an increasing and urgent need for patients and the healthcare system for a NASH diagnostic that is non-invasive  robust and cost-effective. By having both a diagnostic and therapeutic solution  physicians will be able to efficiently manage patients with progressive forms of NASH.”Stephen A. Harrison  Chairman and Founder for Pinnacle Clinical Research  Chairman and Co-Founder of Summit Clinical Research  USA and Visiting Professor of Hepatology at the Radcliffe Department of Medicine  University of Oxford  UK commented:“We are excited that the development and validation of NIS2+™ have been recognized by one of the leading medical journals. Thanks to such progression in patient management with the development of this next-generation technology  physicians can offer satisfactory solutions to patients suffering from at-risk NASH.”GENFIT continues to explore the possibility of obtaining regulatory approval and CE Certificates of Conformity  alone or with a development and commercial partner  to release an IVD test powered by NIS2+™ technology on the US and European markets.ABOUT GENFITGENFIT is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to improving the lives of patients with rare and severe liver diseases characterized by high unmet medical needs.

(Euronext Amsterdam: ASM) will take its symbolic first step in bringing its US$100 million multi-year investment in Hwaseong (Dongtan)  South Korea  to fruition  with the groundbreaking ceremony tomorrow on its expanded innovation and manufacturing center. The development follows the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding between ASM and the Ministry of Trade  Industry and Energy of the Republic of Korea (‘MOTIE’) earlier this year  around ASM’s intention to carry out this investment by 2025.The groundbreaking ceremony marks a strategic expansion for ASM and an important step in meeting the foreseen growing demand for semiconductors for the years to come. The investment will boost ASM’s research and product-development infrastructure  as well as adding more manufacturing capacity.With the investment  ASM is also committed to creating new job opportunities  especially in engineering  R&D and manufacturing that will contribute to training and workforce development in Korea.The milestone groundbreaking event will be attended by ASM’s CEO  Benjamin Loh and Pauline Van der Meer Mohr  Chair of the Supervisory Board. Guests include political dignitaries such as Kim Dong-Yeon  Governor of Gyeonggi Province  Wan Ki Kim  Deputy Minister for Trade & Investment  Jeong Myeong-Guen  Mayor of Hwaesong city  and Joanne Doornewaard  Ambassador of the Netherlands  alongside customers and business partners  and other ASM colleagues.Speaking ahead of the launch event  Benjamin Loh said this commitment to Hwaseong’s expansion was a bold step forward in ASM’s growth journey. “We couldn’t be happier that it’s taking place in Korea. Ever since we began our operations here back in 1989  we have been impressed by the potential  drive  and dedication of the Korean people. Right from the start  we sensed ASM would be able to do great things here.”Loh added that the investment in Hwaseong is about so much more than just expanding space. “It confirms our commitment to Korea  as well as our ambition to continue growing our business here. Going forward  we aim to enable the continued development of advanced technologies  which will also increase Korea’s ability to facilitate domestic world-class semiconductor innovation.”Hwaseong has been instrumental in ASM’s growth  with the facility delivering advanced R&D and technology for Korean and global customers. Korea is also the global center for ASM’s PEALD business. Technologies developed by ASM’s local R&D team have been at the heart of breakthrough innovations in the semiconductor industry  such as the ALD quad chamber module (QCM) architecture  the TENZA™ ALD for ultra-high aspect ratio (>100:1) gap-fill  and high-quality PEALD silicon and metal oxides and nitrides for spacers  liners  and other patterning applications.ASM currently has more than 450 people working at its Hwaseong facility  and the number is expected to rise as the facility expands. The current building measures just over 20 000 m2  and the new extension will add another 31 000 m2  spread across eight floors. The expansion will more than double the Hwaseong facility’s R&D area while manufacturing area will almost triple.YK Kim  Chairman of ASM Korea  said the expansion of ASM’s Hwaseong facility will create more space for the company’s fast-growing number of employees in Korea and reflects the country’s increasing importance to help the company meet growing global customer demand for advanced semiconductors in the years to come.“It’s an investment in people and in the semiconductor ecosystem in Korea. We wish to cooperate closely with the Korean government  customers  and suppliers to foster and accelerate Korea’s semiconductor industry growth ” Kim said. He expressed his gratitude for support shown to ASM by the government and industry partners in Korea  saying it has been “invaluable in bringing us to this moment”.About ASM InternationalASM International N.V.  headquartered in Almere  the Netherlands  and its subsidiaries design and manufacture equipment and process solutions to produce semiconductor devices for wafer processing  and have facilities in the United States  Europe  and Asia.

It is a non-invasive diagnostic technology designed as an optimization of NIS4® technology  a blood-based panel currently used to detect at-risk NASH.In November 2021  NIS4® was recognized by the NIMBLE2 Initiative of the FNIH’s3 Biomarkers Consortium as showing a unique performance in identifying patients with at-risk NASH.Data presented at the AASLD4 Liver Meeting® in October 2022 demonstrated the robust and improved clinical performance of NIS2+™ allowing an efficient identification of at-risk NASH  irrespective of patient characteristics such as age  sex and type 2 diabetes. It was also demonstrated that NIS2+™ is an effective screening tool for the enrollment of patients with at-risk NASH in clinical trials  reducing liver biopsy failure rates and associated costs without inflating the number of patients to screen.There is currently a high unmet medical need for an In Vitro Diagnostic (IVD) test to enable a non-invasive  accessible and rapid diagnostic that is an alternative to liver biopsy  improving overall clinical care and greatly reducing barriers to entry for innovative therapies. NIS2+™ is the only blood-based technology developed for the identification of at-risk NASH allowing it to be applied for large-scale use in clinical practice.Dr. Vlad Ratziu  Professor at Sorbonne University and Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital in Paris  France commented:“With NASH drugs potentially coming on the market in the very near future  there is an increasing and urgent need for patients and the healthcare system for a NASH diagnostic that is non-invasive  robust and cost-effective. By having both a diagnostic and therapeutic solution  physicians will be able to efficiently manage patients with progressive forms of NASH.”Stephen A. Harrison  Chairman and Founder for Pinnacle Clinical Research  Chairman and Co-Founder of Summit Clinical Research  USA and Visiting Professor of Hepatology at the Radcliffe Department of Medicine  University of Oxford  UK commented:“We are excited that the development and validation of NIS2+™ have been recognized by one of the leading medical journals. Thanks to such progression in patient management with the development of this next-generation technology  physicians can offer satisfactory solutions to patients suffering from at-risk NASH.”GENFIT continues to explore the possibility of obtaining regulatory approval and CE Certificates of Conformity  alone or with a development and commercial partner  to release an IVD test powered by NIS2+™ technology on the US and European markets.ABOUT GENFITGENFIT is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to improving the lives of patients with rare and severe liver diseases characterized by high unmet medical needs.

USA  May 23  2023 - More than 1.8 million Chrysler  Dodge  Ram and Jeep ® brand vehicles on the road in the United States and Canada give drivers in-vehicle notification of an active fire truck  ambulance or other nearby roadway hazards with the Emergency Vehicle Alert System (EVAS) feature of the Uconnect connected vehicle platform.A standard feature of Uconnect that keeps drivers of 2018 model year and newer vehicles safely aware of the environment around them  EVAS is an innovation that emerged from the Stellantis Star*Up program that nurtures and rewards employee innovation.“The widespread deployment of EVAS in North America demonstrates how Stellantis is harnessing the power of V2X connectivity and in-vehicle technology to make mobility safer for our customers ” said Yves Bonnefont  Stellantis Chief Software Officer. “Care for our customers that is second to none – in every market where we sell – is the foundation of our transformation to a mobility tech company. We’re proud to be the first global automaker to make V2X digital alerting a standard safety feature for our connected customers and are continuously looking to expand its capabilities.”EVAS alerts come from HAAS Alert’s Safety Cloud platform  a vehicle-to-everything (V2X) and digital alerting solution used by thousands of public and private roadway fleets in North America. In addition to emergency vehicles  Safety Cloud receives and delivers notifications from tow trucks  disabled vehicles  work zones and arrow boards  highway gates and other connected assets and equipment on the road.Building on the EVAS foundation  Stellantis is now evaluating a next step in V2X active driver safety notifications with Hazard Enhanced Location Protocol (H.E.L.P. ®)  working with Emergency Safety Solutions Inc.H.E.L.P. delivers warnings to drivers approaching a disabled vehicle. Disabled vehicles stopped on the shoulder or roadway pose a significant danger to other drivers  particularly at night or when weather conditions reduce visibility – a situation that in the United States contributes to a crash an average of every seven minutes and kills or injures over 40 people per day  according to research published in Accident Analysis and Prevention   a peer-reviewed public health journal.How H.E.L.P. WorksWhen activated in a disabled vehicle  H.E.L.P. sends a notice of the vehicle and its exact location to HAAS Alert’s Safety Cloud  which transmits a notification to approaching vehicles with Uconnect (or drivers using other mobile and in-dash systems connected to Safety Cloud.) This gives drivers 15-20 seconds of advance warning  which is roughly a quarter mile/0.5 kilometers at highway speeds.With H.E.L.P. disabled vehicles will be able to share critical safety messages with all vehicles that connect to the Safety Cloud platform  unlocking a critical new capability in vehicle-to-vehicle technology and helping to improve road safety for all drivers.H.E.L.P. can be activated manually by the driver when the vehicle is stationary  or automatically in safety-critical situations such as collisions or tire blowouts.A potential enhancement for H.E.L.P.-equipped vehicles with LED lighting is the addition of H.E.L.P. Lighting Alerts  which flashes the hazard warning lights and other exterior lamps at a scientifically tuned rate and pattern to better grab the visual attention of oncoming drivers.Foundation For Future FeaturesEVAS alerts  SOS calls and vehicle health reports via the Uconnect app form the foundation employing data from the vehicle to help Stellantis customers. Owners get enhanced value with activated SiriusXM Guardian subscription features that include stolen vehicle tracking  virtual driver assistance and cellular-based remote start.“Technology we offer today helps set the stage for future vehicle innovations ” said Mamatha Chamarthi  Stellantis Head of Global Software Business Management. “It begins with the foundation that safety should come standard. It grows from there to offer owners convenience features on demand when they connect  enroll and subscribe. These software capabilities result in an enhanced and highly valued customer experience with our iconic brands.”Developing advanced technology that enhances vehicle safety and keeps drivers informed  including using V2X solutions and connected vehicle systems  is a key element of Stellantis’ commitment in the Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan to offer cutting-edge mobility in an aim to become number one in customer satisfaction for products and services in every market with Stellantis operations.Stellantis is developing STLA Brain  STLA SmartCockpit  and STLA AutoDrive  three all-new technology platforms that will be deployed at scale across the four BEV-centric STLA vehicle platforms starting in 2024. The Stellantis software strategy targets generating about €20 billion in incremental annual revenues by the end of the decade  backed by a more than €30 billion planned investment in electrification and software through 2025.# # #About StellantisStellantis N.V.

With this DLC[1] also comes a new edition  the Modstand Bundle  which includes both the main game  Gerda: A Flame in Winter  and the DLC  Liva's Story. Both the main game and the bundle are available on Nintendo Switch and Steam.The Modstand Bundle was created to showcase two very different women's experiences of World War II and to tell two kinds of stories  those of Gerda and Liva. Gerda has lived a quiet life as a nurse and is pushed into involvement with the Resistance by the Gestapo's arrest of her husband  Anders. She is compassionate and tries to avoid conflict where possible. Liva on the other hand has been a member of the Resistance for some time. After a failed mission  her team regroups in Tinglev where she will have to stand up and lead them to their next fight.Liva's Story offers players an alternate look at war through the eyes of a different kind of woman  a resistance leader. Desperate and discouraged after a failed mission  Liva's team has to regroup  patch up  and hit the enemy again using sabotage  infiltration  spying  and even assassination. Opposite to Gerda's empathic approach  Liva is not afraid of using violence and often walks the thin line between justice and revenge. Players will have to carefully balance her fury towards the enemy  duty towards her mission and country  and care for her teammates.The events of Liva's Story take place in the weeks leading up to Anders's arrest and the beginning of Gerda's journey to save him. Each story is a standalone narrative  and each of them sheds light on the other  so players can choose to play them in whichever order they wish.To celebrate the launch of Liva's Story and the Modstand Bundle  a free demo of Gerda: A Flame in Winter (not including the DLC) is available today on Steam.For more information about Gerda: A Flame in Winter and Liva's Story  follow DON'T NOD on Facebook  Twitter  and Instagram.To keep up with Bird Island  visit their Twitter.About DON'T NODDON'T NOD is an independent French publisher and developer  based in Paris and Montreal  creating original narrative games in the adventure (LIFE is STRANGETM  TELL ME WHYTM  TWIN MIRRORTM)  RPG (VAMPYRTM)  and action (REMEMBER METM) genres.

PXT3003 is the most advanced drug candidate of the company in pivotal Phase III clinical study (PREMIER trial) for CMT1A  a rare debilitating peripheral neuropathy.In January 2023  thanks to the increased support from Néovacs that reinforced financial visibility to cover cash requirements through the topline results of the pivotal Phase III clinical study of the drug candidate PXT3003  Pharnext formed an ad hoc strategic committee composed of members of the company's supervisory board and management[2] to identify and sign licensing agreement with pharmaceutical players to complete the development and commercialize PXT3003 in the CMT1A indication in various geographical areas of the world excluding China[3] (U.S.A  European Union  Central and Eastern Europe  Japan  Latin America  etc.). To date this strategic committee has contacted a total of more than 120 pharmaceutical companies mostly involved in rare diseases and / or neurology. Active partnering discussions are ongoing with around 30 companies to license out PXT3003 commercial rights in various geographies. Half of these companies have even engaged in thorough due diligence under confidentiality agreement and are currently reviewing Pharnext's ad hoc dataroom. Today  Pharnext reports that the first non-binding offer has already been received and Pharnext is currently discussing the economic parameters (upfront payment  royalties  exclusivity  …) with of this proposal.A partnership with a pharmaceutical player would provide Pharnext with potentially substantial additional financial resources that would limit  or stop  the use of the financing lines granted by Neovacs and Global Tech Opportunities 13.In order to accelerate this business development process  some members of Pharnext management team will attend the BIO Convention in Boston on June 5-8  2023. Companies interested in meeting with Pharnext business development team can send an email to the following address: contact@pharnext.com.Pharnext will communicate regularly on the advancement of its business development process for PXT3003 in CMT1A.About PharnextPharnext is an advanced clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapies for neurodegenerative diseases currently without satisfactory therapeutic solutions. Pharnext has a first-in-class drug candidate  PXT3003  in development for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A)  a rare  debilitating  inherited peripheral neuropathy. PXT3003 benefits from orphan drug status in Europe and the United States. In 2018  PXT3003 completed a Phase III clinical trial  the PLEO-CMT trial  with encouraging topline results. This trial was followed by an open-label extension study  the PLEO-CMT-FU trial  with 120 patients continuing treatment with PXT3003. Long-term data suggests a sustained benefit  safety  and efficacy  after 5 years of total trial time. An international pivotal Phase III study of PXT3003  the PREMIER trial  is currently ongoing with 387 CMT1A patients enrolled. PREMIER topline results are expected in Q4 2023. PXT3003 originated from the Pleotherapy™ R&D approach. Pharnext draws the attention of investors to the financial and other risk factors detailed in its financial reports.

A daily oral administration of GLPG3667 150mg or placebo will be investigated in approximately 62 adult patients with DM over 24 weeks. The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients with at least minimal improvement in the signs and symptoms of DM at Week 24 according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) criteria.1“We remain committed to delivering transformational medicines to patients living with severe immunological disorders and are pleased to further advance our novel  orally administered TYK2 inhibitor  GLPG3667  into Phase 2 development in dermatomyositis ” said Daniele D’Ambrosio  MD  PhD  Therapeutic Area Head  Immunology  at Galapagos. “Dermatomyositis is a debilitating inflammatory disease marked by muscle weakness and a distinctive skin rash that can severely impact patients’ daily lives. There is a significant unmet need for effective and convenient treatment options for patients living with this rare disease  and we hope that our novel drug-candidate can help address this need and improve patient outcomes.”GLPG3667 is an investigational drug and is not approved by any regulatory authority. Its efficacy and safety have not been established or fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About dermatomyositisIdiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM) are a heterogenous group of rare autoimmune disorders primarily affecting the proximal muscles. They are characterized by severe muscle weakness  muscle enzyme elevations  inflammation on muscle biopsy  and extra-muscular manifestations. DM is the most common form of IIM and is characterized by inflammatory and degenerative changes of the muscles and skin. Early symptoms of DM include distinct skin manifestations accompanying or preceding muscle weakness. The quality of life (QoL) of patients with DM is impaired due to muscle weakness  pain and skin disease activity.2 The overall mortality ratio in DM patients also remains three times higher when compared to the general population; with cancer  lung  and cardiac complications and infections being the most common causes of death.3 DM-specific prevalence has been estimated at one to six per 100 000 adults in the United States  and a recent analysis of 3 067 patients in the Euromyositis registry identified DM in 31% of the sampled patients.4 DM is a rare disease and with only one currently approved treatment  there is a high unmet need for alternative safe and effective treatment options.About GalapagosGalapagos is a fully integrated biotechnology company united around a single purpose: to transform patient outcomes through life-changing science and innovation for more years of life and quality of life.

May 23  2023 /PRNewswire/ --Stellantis' Emergency Vehicle Alert System (EVAS) uses Uconnect connected-vehicle platform system to alert drivers when emergency vehicles and other roadway hazards are nearbyBreakthrough technology that enhances vehicle safety globally is a key element of the Stellantis Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan with the aim to become No. 1 in customer satisfaction for products and serviceEVAS is a standard feature of Uconnect and already active on 1.8 million Chrysler  Dodge  Ram and Jeep® brand vehicles from the 2018 model year and newer in the United States and CanadaEVAS works via an integration with Safety Cloud  the nation's largest vehicle-to-everything (V2X) platform for digital alerting from HAAS AlertPotential next step: Hazard Enhanced Location Protocol (HELP) alerts drivers to disabled passenger and commercial vehicles nearbyMore than 1.8 million Chrysler  Dodge  Ram and Jeep® brand vehicles on the road in the United States and Canada give drivers an in-vehicle notification of an active fire truck  ambulance or other nearby roadway hazards with the Emergency Vehicle Alert System (EVAS) feature of the Uconnect connected-vehicle platform.A standard feature of Uconnect that keeps drivers of 2018 model-year and newer vehicles safely aware of the environment around them  EVAS is an innovation that emerged from the Stellantis Star*Up program that nurtures and rewards employee innovation.""The widespread deployment of EVAS in North America demonstrates how Stellantis is harnessing the power of V2X connectivity and in-vehicle technology to make mobility safer for our customers "" said Yves Bonnefont  Stellantis chief software officer. ""Care for our customers that is second to none in every market where we sell is the foundation of our transformation to a mobility tech company. We're proud to be the first global automaker to make V2X digital alerting a standard safety feature for our connected customers  and we are continuously looking to expand its capabilities.""EVAS alerts come from HAAS Alert's Safety Cloud platform  a vehicle-to-everything (V2X) and digital alerting solution used by thousands of public and private roadway fleets in North America. In addition to emergency vehicles  Safety Cloud receives and delivers notifications from tow trucks  disabled vehicles  work zones and arrow boards  highway gates and other connected assets and equipment on the road.Building on the EVAS foundation  Stellantis is now evaluating a next step in V2X active driver safety notifications with Hazard Enhanced Location Protocol (HELP)  working with Emergency Safety Solutions Inc.HELP delivers warnings to drivers approaching a disabled vehicle. Disabled vehicles stopped on the shoulder or roadway pose a significant danger to other drivers  particularly at night or when weather conditions reduce visibility – a situation that in the United States contributes to a crash an average of every seven minutes and kills or injures more than 40 people per day  according to research published in Accident Analysis and Prevention  a peer-reviewed public health journal.How HELP WorksWhen activated in a disabled vehicle  HELP sends a notice of the vehicle and its exact location to HAAS Alert's Safety Cloud  which transmits a notification to approaching vehicles with Uconnect (or drivers using other mobile and in-dash systems connected to Safety Cloud.) This gives drivers 15-20 seconds of advance warning  which is roughly a quarter mile/0.5 kilometers at highway speeds.With HELP  disabled vehicles will be able to share critical safety messages with all vehicles that connect to the Safety Cloud platform  unlocking a critical new capability in vehicle-to-vehicle technology and helping to improve road safety for all drivers.HELP can be activated manually by the driver when the vehicle is stationary or automatically in safety-critical situations  such as collisions or tire blowouts.A potential enhancement for HELP-equipped vehicles with LED lighting is the addition of HELP Lighting Alerts  which flash the hazard warning lights and other exterior lamps at a scientifically tuned rate and pattern to better grab the visual attention of oncoming drivers.Foundation For Future FeaturesEVAS alerts  SOS calls and vehicle health reports via the Uconnect app form the foundation employing data from the vehicle to help Stellantis customers. Owners get enhanced value with activated SiriusXM Guardian subscription features that include stolen vehicle tracking  virtual driver assistance and cellular-based remote start.""Technology we offer today helps set the stage for future vehicle innovations "" said Mamatha Chamarthi  Stellantis head of global software business management. ""It begins with the foundation that safety should come standard. It grows from there to offer owners convenience features on demand when they connect  enroll and subscribe. These software capabilities result in an enhanced and highly valued customer experience with our iconic brands.""Developing advanced technology that enhances vehicle safety and keeps drivers informed  including using V2X solutions and connected vehicle systems  is a key element of Stellantis' commitment in the Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan to offer cutting-edge mobility in an aim to become No. 1 in customer satisfaction for products and services in every market with Stellantis operations.Stellantis is developing STLA Brain  STLA SmartCockpit and STLA AutoDrive  three all-new technology platforms that will be deployed at scale across the four BEV-centric STLA vehicle platforms starting in 2024.

(""CoolCo"" or the ""Company"").Q1 Highlights and Subsequent EventsGenerated total operating revenues of $98.6 million in Q1  compared to $90.3 million for the fourth quarter 2022 (""Q4"" or ""Q4 2022"")Net income of $70.1 million in Q1  compared to $33.1 million for Q4 and earnings per share of $1.28 for Q1;Achieved average Time Charter Equivalent Earnings (""TCE"") 1 of $83 700 per day for Q1  compared to $83 600  per day for Q4;of $83 700 per day for Q1  compared to $83 600  per day for Q4; Adjusted EBITDA 1 of $67.8 million for Q1  compared to $58.6 million for Q4;of $67.8 million for Q1  compared to $58.6 million for Q4; Commenced previously announced three-year charter on February 11  2023 at a rate that is front-end loaded and averages $120 000 per day over the charter period (average rate applies to quarterly revenues and TCE);Concluded the sale of Golar Seal on March 22  2023 for $184.3 million  releasing approximately $94.4 million  after repayment of its associated debt  that is available to fund the acquisition of the two Hyundai Samho LNG carriers (the ""Newbuild Vessels"") should the Company decide to exercise the newbuild option expiring at the end of June 2023;On March 17  2023  CoolCo's shares commenced trading on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the ticker “CLCO”;On May 17  2023  the Company announced a new multi-year time charter agreement for a TFDE vessel starting early 2024 with an energy major; andDeclared a dividend for Q1 of $0.41 per share  to be paid on or around June 9  2023 to all shareholders of record on June 1  2023.Richard Tyrrell  CEO  commented:“Over the quarters ahead  CoolCo has a clear path to further earnings and dividend growth  punctuated by a series of identifiable milestones: fixing the vessel that becomes available in September 2023  as well as the two vessels available in 2024 that are currently trading at rates well below market levels  and if we exercise the option to acquire two newbuild vessels adding further earnings backlog by securing charters for those vessels and funding the acquisition of those newbuilds with an optimal mix of debt and cash on hand.The term market for modern LNG carriers has demonstrated both strength and stability  reflecting the long-term nature of the LNG business and the sector’s supportive fundamentals. For the few owners with available tonnage  including CoolCo  charterers have remained eager to secure multi-year charters at attractive rates for owners. This stands in sharp contrast to the seasonal lows and high volatility of the spot market  which is currently made up almost entirely of sublets  rather than owners with available tonnage. CoolCo is in an excellent position to successfully execute our term chartering strategy  realize the latent earnings and dividend growth potential in our newbuild purchase option and vessels on below-market charters  and benefiting from the expanded investor base made possible by our recent NYSE listing.Additionally  I would like to highlight the publication of our ESG report for 2022. Last year  the annual efficiency ratio that measures emissions  dropped by 4.5% bringing the total fall since 2019 to 18%  which compares to the IMO target of 6.5%. Our new performance plan includes LNGe upgrades to our TFDE vessels that are expected to reduce our annual efficiency ratio to 6.4 by 2030  a 35% reduction from 2019 levels”.Financial HighlightsThe table below sets forth certain key financial information for Q1 2023  Q4 2022 and Q1 2022  split between Successor and Predecessor periods (as defined below).Q1 2023 Q4 2022 Three months ended March 31 2022 (in thousands of $  except TCE) Successor Successor Successor Predecessor Total Time and voyage charter revenues 91 168 79 032 4 285 36 542 40 827 Total operating revenues 98 649 90 255 4 285 39 776 44 061 Operating income 52 022 48 881 966 21 661 22 627 Net income 70 132 33 069 (966) 16 024 15 058 Adjusted EBITDA1 67 814 58 621 1 958 27 400 29 358 Average daily TCE1(to the closest $100) 83 700 83 600 50 100 57 200 56 300Note: The commencement of operations and funding of CoolCo and the acquisition of its initial tri-fuel diesel electric (""TFDE"") LNG carriers  The Cool Pool Limited and the shipping and FSRU management organization from Golar LNG Limited (""Golar"") were completed in a phased process. It commenced with the funding of CoolCo on January 27  2022 and concluded with the acquisition of the LNG carrier and FSRU management organization on June 30  2022  with vessel acquisitions taking place on different dates over that period. Results for the three months that commenced January 1  2022 and ended March 31  2022 have therefore been split between the period prior to the funding of CoolCo and various phased acquisitions of vessel and management entities (the ""Predecessor"" period) and the period subsequent to the various phased acquisitions (the ""Successor"" period). The combined results are not in accordance with U.S. GAAP and consist of the aggregate of selected financial data of the Successor and Predecessor periods. No other adjustments have been made to the combined presentation.LNG Market ReviewThe Quarter commenced with the Japan/Korea Marker gas price (""JKM"") at $29/MMBtu  the Dutch Title Transfer Facility gas price (""TTF"") at $27/MMBtu and quoted TFDE headline spot rates of $163 000 per day. Unwinding of floating storage  a warmer than normal winter  falling LNG prices and no arbitrage to pull cargoes east saw available vessels increase throughout January to early February and spot rates began their seasonal decline. Sentiment and momentum turned positive in mid-February following confirmation of Freeport LNG’s restart  although this was short-lived as a long list of available sublet tonnage in the Atlantic maintained pressure on rates. Term-rates  however  have remained strong with charterers needing to charter vessels for 12 months or longer to secure winter coverage. The Quarter concluded with JKM at $13/MMBtu  TTF at $15/MMBtu and quoted TFDE headline spot rates of $54 000 per day.Masked by a spot market dominated by sublets  there are fewer owner-controlled vessels available to charter for the forthcoming winter than there were this time last year. Those few owners with available tonnage  including CoolCo  remain reluctant to fix their vessels for short periods that only cover the highly profitable winter market  preferring longer term work instead. Floating storage is once again higher than normal and interest in longer-term charters that cover the upcoming winter season is increasing. We expect that  already strong term rates will likely firm further over the coming months when CoolCo expects to fix its September 2023 vessel opening.Operational ReviewCoolCo's fleet continued to perform well with no technical off-hire during the Quarter. The Golar Seal completed its charter and was immediately delivered to her new owner on March 22  2023  ensuring no idle-time and a Q1 fleet utilization of 100%. There are no drydocks planned for 2023  with the next drydock expected during the second quarter of 2024.Business DevelopmentCoolCo is in discussions with multiple potential charterers seeking work for the 2-stroke LNG carrier newbuilds with anticipated delivery in late 2024 which the Company has an option to acquire. With the recent sale of the Golar Seal  the Company has sufficient funds available to fund the initial milestones of the newbuild option (if exercised) on or prior to June 30  2023. The total price of $234 million for each carrier is approximately 10% lower than currently quoted prices for comparable newbuild vessels that will not deliver until 2027/2028.Financing and LiquidityInclusive of $94.4 million of cash released upon sale of Golar Seal  CoolCo had cash and cash equivalents of $240.6 million at March 31  2023. Total short and long-term debt  net of deferred finance charges and after repayment of $88.0 million of debt associated with the Golar Seal  as of March 31  2023 amounted to $1 032.4 million. Total Contractual Debt1 stood at $1 145.3 million  which comprised of $442.5 million in respect of the five vessel bank financing facility maturing in March 2027 (the ""$570 million bank facility"")  $500.6 million in respect of the four vessel bank financing facility maturing in May 2029 (the “$520 million term loan facility”)  and $202.2 million in respect of the two sale and leaseback facilities maturing in January 2025 (Ice and Kelvin).During Q1  we entered into further floating interest rate (SOFR) swap agreements for a notional amount of $132.2 million in respect of the ING bank facility. Subsequent to Quarter end  we entered into further SOFR swap agreements for a notional amount of $40.0 million in respect of the same facility. Overall  the Company’s interest rate on its debt is fixed or hedged for approximately 89%  adjusting for existing cash on hand  but excluding cash that is required to exercise the newbuild option.Corporate and Other MattersAs of March 31  2023  CoolCo had 53 688 462 shares issued and outstanding. Of these  31 254 390 shares (58.2%) were owned by EPS Ventures Ltd (""EPS"") and 22 434 072 (41.8%) were publicly owned.On March 14  2023  in relation to the proposed listing of the Company’s ordinary shares on the NYSE  the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission declared the Company’s registration statement on Form 20-F effective. After a scheduled two-day trading suspension on the Euronext Growth Oslo  shares in CoolCo commenced trading on both exchanges on March 17  2023 under the ticker “CLCO”. No CoolCo securities were issued in connection with the NYSE share listing.In line with the Company’s variable dividend policy  the Board has declared a Q1 dividend of $0.41 per ordinary share. The record date is June 1  2023 and the dividend will be distributed to DTC-registered shareholders on or around June 9  2023  while  due to the implementation of CSDR in Norway  the dividend will be distributed to Euronext VPS-registered shareholders on or about June 14  2023.OutlookWith a significant volume of US cargoes currently being diverted to Europe and thereby reducing aggregate fleet tonne-miles  it is important to place the current 50% orderbook-to-fleet ratio into both an appropriate larger context and the relevant competitive context for CoolCo. Set against a backdrop of lower tonne-miles as a result of more US cargoes being diverted to Europe  an orderbook representing 50% of the on-the-water fleet looks high. CoolCo remains of the view that underlying market fundamentals are supportive of the orders. Ninety percent of vessels on order are committed to specific projects  and an increased charterer emphasis on energy security rather than utilization maximization  longer discharge times at European FSRUs and seasonal storage plays mean that rising tonne-time should mitigate the impact of lower tonne-miles for cargoes diverted to Europe. Additionally  IMO carbon intensity indicator rules that came into effect on January 1 2023  shipping being subject to European carbon pricing from 2024  charterer commitments to reduce their carbon footprints and high LNG prices are all factors that increase the appeal and competitive advantage of modern and efficient vessels such as those in CoolCo fleet. Much of this demand will be at the expense of older  less efficient steam turbine vessels that represent approximately 22% of the combined current and ordered fleet capacity. Lastly  the limited number of modern vessels that do become available over the next 18 months are in the hands of even fewer owners than was previously the case  adding to their bargaining power. As evidenced by a healthy market for 3+ year charters  owners appear reluctant to fix vessels for short durations covering only the most profitable winter months when a willingness to pay for floating storage peaks  preferring instead to secure coverage until the next wave of LNG volumes come into the market in 2026-2027. With a 4-year lead-time  a vessel ordered today is unlikely to frustrate this position  and at $260 million per newbuild vessel for delivery 2026/27  it will set an increased benchmark charter rate against which the fleet becomes priced. Collectively  these fundamentals are expected to support the continuity of a healthy charter rate environment independent of a seasonally volatile spot market dominated by sublets.FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTSThis press release and any other written or oral statements made by us in connection with this press release include forward-looking statements.

Q1 Highlights and Subsequent Events Generated total operating revenues of $98.6 million in Q1  compared to $90.3 million for the fourth quarter 2022 (""Q4"" or ""Q4 2022"")Net income of $70.1 million in Q1  compared to $33.1 million for Q4 and earnings per share of $1.28 for Q1;Achieved average Time Charter Equivalent Earnings (""TCE"") 1 of $83 700 per day for Q1  compared to $83 600  per day for Q4;of $83 700 per day for Q1  compared to $83 600  per day for Q4; Adjusted EBITDA 1 of $67.8 million for Q1  compared to $58.6 million for Q4;of $67.8 million for Q1  compared to $58.6 million for Q4; Commenced previously announced three-year charter on February 11  2023 at a rate that is front-end loaded and averages $120 000 per day over the charter period (average rate applies to quarterly revenues and TCE);Concluded the sale of Golar Seal on March 22  2023 for $184.3 million  releasing approximately $94.4 million  after repayment of its associated debt  that is available to fund the acquisition of the two Hyundai Samho LNG carriers (the ""Newbuild Vessels"") should the Company decide to exercise the newbuild option expiring at the end of June 2023;On March 17  2023  CoolCo's shares commenced trading on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the ticker “CLCO”;On May 17  2023  the Company announced a new multi-year time charter agreement for a TFDE vessel starting early 2024 with an energy major; andDeclared a dividend for Q1 of $0.41 per share  to be paid on or around June 9  2023 to all shareholders of record on June 1  2023. Richard Tyrrell  CEO  commented: “Over the quarters ahead  CoolCo has a clear path to further earnings and dividend growth  punctuated by a series of identifiable milestones: fixing the vessel that becomes available in September 2023  as well as the two vessels available in 2024 that are currently trading at rates well below market levels  and if we exercise the option to acquire two newbuild vessels adding further earnings backlog by securing charters for those vessels and funding the acquisition of those newbuilds with an optimal mix of debt and cash on hand. The term market for modern LNG carriers has demonstrated both strength and stability  reflecting the long-term nature of the LNG business and the sector’s supportive fundamentals. For the few owners with available tonnage  including CoolCo  charterers have remained eager to secure multi-year charters at attractive rates for owners. This stands in sharp contrast to the seasonal lows and high volatility of the spot market  which is currently made up almost entirely of sublets  rather than owners with available tonnage. CoolCo is in an excellent position to successfully execute our term chartering strategy  realize the latent earnings and dividend growth potential in our newbuild purchase option and vessels on below-market charters  and benefiting from the expanded investor base made possible by our recent NYSE listing. Additionally  I would like to highlight the publication of our ESG report for 2022. Last year  the annual efficiency ratio that measures emissions  dropped by 4.5% bringing the total fall since 2019 to 18%  which compares to the IMO target of 6.5%. Our new performance plan includes LNGe upgrades to our TFDE vessels that are expected to reduce our annual efficiency ratio to 6.4 by 2030  a 35% reduction from 2019 levels”.

No other adjustments have been made to the combined presentation. LNG Market Review The Quarter commenced with the Japan/Korea Marker gas price (""JKM"") at $29/MMBtu  the Dutch Title Transfer Facility gas price (""TTF"") at $27/MMBtu and quoted TFDE headline spot rates of $163 000 per day. Unwinding of floating storage  a warmer than normal winter  falling LNG prices and no arbitrage to pull cargoes east saw available vessels increase throughout January to early February and spot rates began their seasonal decline. Sentiment and momentum turned positive in mid-February following confirmation of Freeport LNG’s restart  although this was short-lived as a long list of available sublet tonnage in the Atlantic maintained pressure on rates. Term-rates  however  have remained strong with charterers needing to charter vessels for 12 months or longer to secure winter coverage. The Quarter concluded with JKM at $13/MMBtu  TTF at $15/MMBtu and quoted TFDE headline spot rates of $54 000 per day. Masked by a spot market dominated by sublets  there are fewer owner-controlled vessels available to charter for the forthcoming winter than there were this time last year. Those few owners with available tonnage  including CoolCo  remain reluctant to fix their vessels for short periods that only cover the highly profitable winter market  preferring longer term work instead. Floating storage is once again higher than normal and interest in longer-term charters that cover the upcoming winter season is increasing. We expect that  already strong term rates will likely firm further over the coming months when CoolCo expects to fix its September 2023 vessel opening. Operational Review CoolCo's fleet continued to perform well with no technical off-hire during the Quarter. The Golar Seal completed its charter and was immediately delivered to her new owner on March 22  2023  ensuring no idle-time and a Q1 fleet utilization of 100%. There are no drydocks planned for 2023  with the next drydock expected during the second quarter of 2024. Business Development CoolCo is in discussions with multiple potential charterers seeking work for the 2-stroke LNG carrier newbuilds with anticipated delivery in late 2024 which the Company has an option to acquire. With the recent sale of the Golar Seal  the Company has sufficient funds available to fund the initial milestones of the newbuild option (if exercised) on or prior to June 30  2023. The total price of $234 million for each carrier is approximately 10% lower than currently quoted prices for comparable newbuild vessels that will not deliver until 2027/2028. Financing and Liquidity Inclusive of $94.4 million of cash released upon sale of Golar Seal  CoolCo had cash and cash equivalents of $240.6 million at March 31  2023. Total short and long-term debt  net of deferred finance charges and after repayment of $88.0 million of debt associated with the Golar Seal  as of March 31  2023 amounted to $1 032.4 million. Total Contractual Debt1 stood at $1 145.3 million  which comprised of $442.5 million in respect of the five vessel bank financing facility maturing in March 2027 (the ""$570 million bank facility"")  $500.6 million in respect of the four vessel bank financing facility maturing in May 2029 (the “$520 million term loan facility”)  and $202.2 million in respect of the two sale and leaseback facilities maturing in January 2025 (Ice and Kelvin). During Q1  we entered into further floating interest rate (SOFR) swap agreements for a notional amount of $132.2 million in respect of the ING bank facility. Subsequent to Quarter end  we entered into further SOFR swap agreements for a notional amount of $40.0 million in respect of the same facility. Overall  the Company’s interest rate on its debt is fixed or hedged for approximately 89%  adjusting for existing cash on hand  but excluding cash that is required to exercise the newbuild option. Corporate and Other Matters As of March 31  2023  CoolCo had 53 688 462 shares issued and outstanding.

""Care for our customers that is second to none in every market where we sell is the foundation of our transformation to a mobility tech company. We're proud to be the first global automaker to make V2X digital alerting a standard safety feature for our connected customers  and we are continuously looking to expand its capabilities.""EVAS alerts come from HAAS Alert's Safety Cloud platform  a vehicle-to-everything (V2X) and digital alerting solution used by thousands of public and private roadway fleets in North America. In addition to emergency vehicles  Safety Cloud receives and delivers notifications from tow trucks  disabled vehicles  work zones and arrow boards  highway gates and other connected assets and equipment on the road.Building on the EVAS foundation  Stellantis is now evaluating a next step in V2X active driver safety notifications with Hazard Enhanced Location Protocol (HELP)  working with Emergency Safety Solutions Inc.HELP delivers warnings to drivers approaching a disabled vehicle. Disabled vehicles stopped on the shoulder or roadway pose a significant danger to other drivers  particularly at night or when weather conditions reduce visibility – a situation that in the United States contributes to a crash an average of every seven minutes and kills or injures more than 40 people per day  according to research published in Accident Analysis and Prevention  a peer-reviewed public health journal.How HELP WorksWhen activated in a disabled vehicle  HELP sends a notice of the vehicle and its exact location to HAAS Alert's Safety Cloud  which transmits a notification to approaching vehicles with Uconnect (or drivers using other mobile and in-dash systems connected to Safety Cloud.) This gives drivers 15-20 seconds of advance warning  which is roughly a quarter mile/0.5 kilometers at highway speeds.With HELP  disabled vehicles will be able to share critical safety messages with all vehicles that connect to the Safety Cloud platform  unlocking a critical new capability in vehicle-to-vehicle technology and helping to improve road safety for all drivers.HELP can be activated manually by the driver when the vehicle is stationary or automatically in safety-critical situations  such as collisions or tire blowouts.A potential enhancement for HELP-equipped vehicles with LED lighting is the addition of HELP Lighting Alerts  which flash the hazard warning lights and other exterior lamps at a scientifically tuned rate and pattern to better grab the visual attention of oncoming drivers.Foundation For Future FeaturesEVAS alerts  SOS calls and vehicle health reports via the Uconnect app form the foundation employing data from the vehicle to help Stellantis customers. Owners get enhanced value with activated SiriusXM Guardian subscription features that include stolen vehicle tracking  virtual driver assistance and cellular-based remote start.""Technology we offer today helps set the stage for future vehicle innovations "" said Mamatha Chamarthi  Stellantis head of global software business management. ""It begins with the foundation that safety should come standard. It grows from there to offer owners convenience features on demand when they connect  enroll and subscribe. These software capabilities result in an enhanced and highly valued customer experience with our iconic brands.""Developing advanced technology that enhances vehicle safety and keeps drivers informed  including using V2X solutions and connected vehicle systems  is a key element of Stellantis' commitment in the Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan to offer cutting-edge mobility in an aim to become No. 1 in customer satisfaction for products and services in every market with Stellantis operations.Stellantis is developing STLA Brain  STLA SmartCockpit and STLA AutoDrive  three all-new technology platforms that will be deployed at scale across the four BEV-centric STLA vehicle platforms starting in 2024.

Hypersensitivity Reactions: With GBCAs  serious hypersensitivity reactions have occurred. In most cases  initial symptoms occurred within minutes of GBCA administration and resolved with prompt emergency treatment. Before ELUCIREM administration  assess all patients for any history of a reaction to contrast media  bronchial asthma and/or allergic disorders. These patients may have an increased risk for a hypersensitivity reaction to ELUCIREM.With GBCAs  serious hypersensitivity reactions have occurred. In most cases  initial symptoms occurred within minutes of GBCA administration and resolved with prompt emergency treatment. Before ELUCIREM administration  assess all patients for any history of a reaction to contrast media  bronchial asthma and/or allergic disorders. These patients may have an increased risk for a hypersensitivity reaction to ELUCIREM. Gadolinium Retention: Gadolinium is retained for months or years in several organs. Linear GBCAs cause more retention than macrocyclic GBCAs. Consequences of gadolinium retention in the brain have not been established. Pathologic and clinical consequences of GBCA administration and retention in skin and other organs have been established in patients with impaired renal function. While clinical consequences of gadolinium retention have not been established in patients with normal renal function  certain patients might be at higher risk. These include patients requiring multiple lifetime doses  pregnant and pediatric patients  and patients with inflammatory conditions. Consider the retention characteristics of the agent when choosing a GBCA for these patients.

(Euronext: ONWD)  the medical technology company creating innovative spinal cord stimulation therapies to restore movement  function  and independence in people with spinal cord injury (SCI)  today announces a publication in Nature showing that a wireless brain-computer interface (BCI) can use thought to modulate ARC Therapy. Researchers reported that when paired with ARC Therapy  an implanted BCI allowed an individual to gain augmented control over when and how he moved his paralyzed legs.“This publication shows the remarkable potential of ARC Therapy to be enhanced with the introduction of a BCI  facilitating more natural movement based on the thoughts of a person living with paralysis ” said Dave Marver  CEO of ONWARD. “We have positioned ONWARD as a leader in the BCI field with our unique understanding of spinal cord stimulation for people with SCI.”“The BCI establishes a continuous link between movement intentions and spinal cord stimulation  allowing for more natural restoration of mobility ” said neuroscientist Grégoire Courtine  professor at EPFL  and co-author of the Nature paper. “I look forward to working with the ONWARD team to advance this important new technology.”The data published today are part of an ongoing clinical feasibility study investigating the safety and preliminary effectiveness of brain-controlled spinal cord stimulation after SCI. The study is being coordinated by .NeuroRestore co-Directors – Grégoire Courtine and Jocelyne Bloch  a neurosurgeon at Lausanne University Hospital ( CHUV ) – as well as Guillaume Charvet  Head of the Medical Device Development Lab at CEA-Leti / Clinatec.All ONWARD devices and therapies  including but not limited to ARC-IM  ARC-EX  and ARC Therapy  are investigational and not available for commercial use.About ONWARD MedicalONWARD is a medical technology company creating therapies to restore movement  function  and independence in people with spinal cord injury (SCI) and movement disabilities.
