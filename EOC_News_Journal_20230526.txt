Both groups monitor and certify the safety of products and their production processes for health and environmental impact.The two groups have formalized a five-year-old agreement to enhance sustainable chemical management and cleaner chemistry principles but still meet the needs of chemical formulators and manufacturers  suppliers  brands and retailers. This new iteration of the agreement augments the benefits of both organizations to brands and their suppliers through a cohesive approach to sustainable chemical and product management across global supply chains.Frank Michel  executive director of the ZDHC Foundation  noted how the new collaboration is a significant step towards a sustainable future for the industry.“This partnership brings together our expertise to drive sustainability in the textile industry ” he said. “Together  we aim to accelerate sustainable chemical management  responsible production  and safer materials.”The new version of the agreement provides a framework for the work of the two groups. It includes an Oeko-Tex eco passport that certifies conformity against the ZDHC MRSL V3.1.The passport can be obtained from any Oeko-Tex eco-passport labs but to display the certificate  chemical formulators must register the products with the ZDHC gateway.It also smooths out alignment with the upcoming ZDHC Chemicals to Zero Program  and maximizes knowledge sharing between technical groups from both organizations.Further  both groups agree that Oeko-Tex will promote ZDHC products and platforms such as Gateway  ClearStream and InCheck to minimize duplication of efforts and promote harmony in the industry.Through the new agreement  customers using Oeko-Tex STeP  a health and safety certification program  gain access to the ZDHC Gateway and the ZDHC Supplier to Zero Program  which will further prepare them for Oeko-Tex STeP certification. Beginning in late summer 2023  customer requirements will be simplified by wastewater testing for Oeko-Tex Step which directly translates to a ZDHC ClearStream.The two organizations will share data  which will improve data quality and make evaluation of impact more credible. The roll-out schedule is yet to be determined.STeP customers already benefit from the partnership between Oeko-Tex x The BHive which enables customers to digitize their chemical inventories. Through The BHive customers can conduct ZDHC Performance InCheck and conformity checks against the ZDHC Gateway  the largest database of chemical products certified against the ZDHC MRSL.According to Georg Dieners  general secretary of Oeko-Tex  both organizations will be served by joining forces this way.“The benefits of collaboration will drive transformational change and meet the true requirements of the industry ” he said.,neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,positive,0.82,0.18,0.0,True,English,"['ZDHC Renew Accord', 'Production\xa0Safety', 'Oeko-Tex', 'cleaner chemistry principles', 'global supply chains', 'Oeko-Tex eco-passport labs', 'ZDHC MRSL V', 'upcoming ZDHC Chemicals', 'sustainable chemical management', 'safety certification program', 'ZDHC Performance InCheck', 'Oeko-Tex STeP certification', 'Oeko-Tex eco passport', 'product management', 'Hazardous Chemicals', 'sustainable future', 'Zero Program', 'chemical formulators', 'chemical inventories', 'significant step', 'ZDHC Foundation', 'ZDHC Supplier', 'new union', 'Zero Discharge', 'International Association', 'Leather Ecology', 'production processes', 'new iteration', 'cohesive approach', 'Frank Michel', 'executive director', 'responsible production', 'safer materials', 'new version', 'late summer', 'customer requirements', 'roll-out schedule', 'largest database', 'Georg Dieners', 'general secretary', 'transformational change', 'true requirements', 'ZDHC gateway', 'chemical products', 'environmental impact', 'ZDHC products', 'ZDHC ClearStream', 'two groups', 'technical groups', 'five-year-old agreement', 'new collaboration', 'new agreement', 'wastewater testing', 'data quality', 'conformity checks', 'STeP customers', 'industry guidelines', 'two organizations', 'The BHive', 'textile industry', 'goal', 'Research', 'Field', 'health', 'needs', 'manufacturers', 'suppliers', 'brands', 'retailers', 'benefits', 'partnership', 'expertise', 'sustainability', 'framework', 'certificate', 'alignment', 'knowledge', 'platforms', 'duplication', 'efforts', 'harmony', 'access', 'evaluation', 'forces']",2023-05-25,2023-05-26,sourcingjournal.com
25354,Clearstream,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/business/576868-eu-russia-profits-ukraine/,EU wants to send profits from frozen Russian assets to Ukraine – FT,European Union officials are considering whether to send Ukraine profits generated from Russian assets frozen in the bloc  FT reported Read Full Article at RT.com,The bloc is exploring “uncharted territory ” sources have told the outletEuropean Union officials are considering whether to send to Ukraine profits generated from Russian assets frozen within the bloc  the Financial Times has reported  citing people familiar with the discussions.EU member states and European Commission officials convened on Wednesday to examine how they might move funds held at Euroclear  the world’s largest settlement house  over to Ukraine  as Russian-owned assets there have accrued interest since they were first frozen.Targeted under an unprecedented Western sanctions campaign  the Russian assets stuck at Euroclear amount to €196.6 billion ($211.1 billion)  the vast majority of which is owned by the country’s central bank. As the assets have generated hundreds of millions in interest over the last year  the clearing house has reinvested those funds  and officials now hope to transfer the resulting profits to Kiev.“It’s not entirely clear who this interest belongs to ” one person familiar with the plans told FT  adding that while passing the profits to Ukraine would be “uncharted territory ” the EU believes “it could be done.”Some European officials have called to extend a similar concept to a wider range of frozen Russian assets – including those trapped at Clearstream  a settlement agency based in Luxembourg – with another source telling the outlet that financial institutions simply “don’t know what to do with this money.”However  settlement houses attempting to implement profit-siphoning schemes are likely to face legal challenges  as Euroclear has already been sued by Russian asset-holders. In March  the firm declared that it would not touch “any profits related to the Russian sanctions until the situation becomes clearer ” suggesting it could be hesitant to go forward with the plans.Russia's National Settlement Depository (NSD) has attempted to obtain permits to release the Russian-owned funds from European clearing systems since last year. However  such permits do not ensure that investors will ever see their money  given uncertainties about withdrawing procedures in the EU  as well as the bloc’s designs on the cash.Moscow has called the Western attempts to transfer the seized assets to Ukraine “barbarism ” and “theft” that violates international law  while the Kremlin has warned that Russia will respond in kind if necessary.EU officials will discuss the matter further during a meeting in late June  with the Commission recently saying that it is “exploring ways” to use frozen assets to “ensure that Russia pays for the damages caused in Ukraine.”,neutral,0.02,0.96,0.02,negative,0.0,0.04,0.96,True,English,"['frozen Russian assets', 'EU', 'profits', 'Ukraine', 'FT', 'unprecedented Western sanctions campaign', 'National Settlement Depository', 'European clearing systems', 'largest settlement house', 'European Union officials', 'EU member states', 'European Commission officials', 'clearing house', 'Russian sanctions', 'Western attempts', 'European officials', 'settlement agency', 'settlement houses', 'uncharted territory', 'Financial Times', 'vast majority', 'central bank', 'last year', 'one person', 'similar concept', 'wider range', 'financial institutions', 'profit-siphoning schemes', 'legal challenges', 'Russian asset-holders', 'international law', 'late June', 'EU officials', 'Russian assets', 'Russian-owned assets', 'frozen assets', 'Euroclear amount', 'Russian-owned funds', 'resulting profits', 'bloc', 'sources', 'outlet', 'Ukraine', 'people', 'discussions', 'Wednesday', 'world', 'interest', 'country', 'hundreds', 'millions', 'Kiev', 'plans', 'FT', 'Clearstream', 'Luxembourg', 'money', 'March', 'firm', 'situation', 'NSD', 'permits', 'investors', 'uncertainties', 'procedures', 'designs', 'cash', 'Moscow', 'Kremlin', 'kind', 'matter', 'meeting', 'ways', 'damages']",2023-05-25,2023-05-26,rt.com

This priority period is neither transferable nor negotiable.Convertible Bonds not subscribed for  on an irreducible or reducible basis  within the priority subscription period by shareholders will be offered to the public in the context of a public offering in France  it being specified that the Offering is subject to a subscription commitment by Irata LLC (“Irata”) for the entire amount of the convertible bond offering during the subscription period (the “Subscription Commitment”). Any orders received within the public offering are therefore likely not to be served.The subscription price of the Convertible Bonds under the priority subscription period will be equal to the subscription price of the Convertible Bonds in the public offering and is set at 0.15 euro per share. The subscription price per Convertible Bond shall be equal to the nominal value of each Convertible Bond  to be fully paid up in cash and/or by way of set-off of claims at the time of subscription. On the basis of the closing price of the Company's shares on May 23  2023  i.e. 0.1304 euro  the subscription price of one Convertible Bond of 0.15 euro represents a premium of 15%.Subscription commitmentIrata  a 27.73% shareholder of the Company and held by Wade Rosen  chairman and CEO of Atari  has irrevocably undertaken in the Subscription Commitment to subscribe to the Offering during the priority subscription period of the Offering  on an irreducible basis  up to the amount of its stake in the Company's share capital (i.e. a total number of 55 460 000 Convertible Bonds) and on a reducible basis  up to the balance of the total amount of the Offering not subscribed by it on an irreducible basis  i.e. up to a maximum total amount (including conversion premium) of 21 681 000 euros (i.e.  up to 144 540 000 Convertible Bonds). Moreover  in the event that at the end of the subscription period of the Offering  the subscriptions do not represent 100% of the amount of the Offering  Irata has irrevocably and unconditionally undertaken to subscribe for the Convertible Bonds which will have not been fully paid by the subscribers  allowing for full subscription of this threshold of 100% of the principal amount of this convertible bonds offering  i.e. up to a maximum of 200 000 000 Convertible Bonds for an amount of 30 million euros.The amount of the Subscription Commitment will be paid  in priority  by way of set-off against due claims that Irata holds on the Company in respect of shareholders' loans previously granted  for an aggregate amount of €16 333 740.68 and the balance in cash.In addition  Irata has agreed not to convert the Convertible Bonds prior to June 30  2025 (date on which the triggering threshold for a mandatory tender offering on the Company's shares is raised from 30% to 50% of the shares and/or the voting rights)  provided that in the event of a tender offer on Atari's securities filed by a third party prior to June 30  2025  Irata will have the option to convert its Convertible Bonds prior to such date. As from January 1  2024  Irata also retains the right to convert its Convertible Bonds upon clearance by AMF (décision de conformité) of a tender offer on the Company's securities filed by Irata (or an affiliate).Use of proceedsOn the basis of 100% of the Offering  the gross proceeds from the Offering will amount to approximately 30 million euros and the net proceeds will amount to 29 million euros  it being specified that Irata's subscription to the Offering will be made by way of debt set-off in respect of the repayment of shareholder loans up to its current amount of €16 333 740.68  thus reinforcing the balance sheet of the Company.The balance of the proceeds from the Offering will enable the Company to increase its financial flexibility and general corporate purposes in the context of the development of its transformation strategy:Continued investment in growth initiatives  notably with the on-going development of more than 12 new games that are expected to be launched in the next 18 months; andSeize additional acquisition of opportunities that may arise  including intellectual property rights and direct minority investment in companies offering value-added solutions for the Group.Prior to the Offering  the Company does not have sufficient consolidated net working capital to meet its current obligations for the next (12) months  including the expected contribution of Night Dive Studios. Based on current and planned development projects  notably given the expenses incurred for the ongoing development of new games  the Company will be able to fund its operations until the end of the month of June 2023  without taking into account the proceeds from the Offer. The net amount of additional cash required by the Company to meet its needs over the next 12 months amounts to around 4.5 million euros.Although the Company currently benefits from the continued financial support of its principal shareholder Irata through September 2023  the Offering is the preferred solution for the Company to finance its activity  it being specified that this transaction is subject to the firm and irrevocable Subscription Commitment by Irata covering 100% of the Offering amount. In the event of completion of the Offering  the Company will have sufficient consolidated net working capital to meet its cash requirements over the next twelve (12) months.Date of issue and interestThe Convertible Bonds shall be issued at par and will bear interest from June 5  2023 (the ""Issue Date"") at a rate of 6.50% per annum  payable semi-annually in arrears on July 31 and January

the seventh business day (included) preceding the Maturity Date  or the relevant early redemption date  as the case may be.The conversion ratio is set at one share per Convertible Bond  subject to

However  no assurance can be given that an active market for the Convertible Bonds will develop or that Bondholders will be able to sell their Convertible Bonds on such market at satisfactory price and liquidity  in particular given the fact that the main shareholder has undertaken to subscribe to 100% of the of the Convertible Bonds. In addition  if such a market were to develop  it cannot be excluded that the market price of the Convertible Bonds would be subject to significant volatility. If an active market does not develop  the liquidity and price of the Convertible Bonds will be affected. Finally  there is no obligation to make a market in the Convertible Bonds and the Company has not mandated any intermediary to ensure the liquidity of the Convertible Bonds. The Company may not be able to pay the interest or redeem the Convertible Bonds : The Company may not have sufficient financial capacity to pay the interest or redeem the Convertible Bonds. The Company's ability to pay interest and to redeem the Convertible Bonds will depend  among other things  on its financial situation at the time of payment of interest or redemption and may be limited by applicable law  by the terms of its indebtedness and  if applicable  by the terms of any new financing in place at that time that may replace  increase or modify the Company's existing or future debt. The market price of the Company’s shares may fluctuate and fall below the conversion price of the Convertible Bonds : The Company's shares may be traded at a price below the market price prevailing on the date of determination of the conversion price of the Convertible Bonds. The Company cannot provide any assurance that the Company's share market price will not fall below the such price. The Company's cannot provide any assurance that  subsequent to the conversion of the Convertible Bonds  investors will be able to sell their shares at a price at least equal to or greater than such price. The conversion of the Convertible Bonds or the sale of the shares resulting from the conversion of the Convertible Bonds on the market by bondholders is likely to have an adverse impact on the market price of the shares : The conversion of the Convertible Bonds or the sale of the shares resulting from the conversion of the Convertible Bonds by Bondholders is likely to have an adverse impact on the market price of the Company's shares. The Company cannot foresee the possible effects of these events on the market price of the shares. Bondholders have limited anti-dilution protection : The Conversion Ratio applicable in the event of conversion into new shares of the Convertible Bonds will only be adjusted in limited circumstances. Therefore  the Conversion Ratio will not be adjusted in all cases where an event relating to the Company or any other event would be likely to affect the value of the Company's shares or  more generally  to have a dilutive impact. The early redemption of the Convertible Bonds is subject to the approval of the Bondholders' meeting : In the event notably (i) of a breach by the Company of its obligations under the Convertible Bonds  (ii) cross default  (iii) preventive or collective insolvency proceeding or (iv) delisting of the Company's shares  the early redemption of the Convertible Bonds may only be triggered if a majority of the Bondholders have approved the request. Given Irata's subscription commitment and the significant holding of Convertible Bonds that could result  there is no guarantee that a vote in favor of early redemption will be obtained. Risk related to meetings and vote of Noteholders  modification and waivers: Certain provisions permit in certain cases defined majorities to bind all Bondholders including Bondholders who did not attend (or were not represented) and vote at the relevant general meeting  Bondholders who voted in a manner contrary to the majority and Bondholders who did not respond to  or rejected  the relevant resolution. If a decision is adopted by a majority of Bondholders and such modifications were to impair or limit the rights of the Bondholders  this may have a negative impact on the market value of the Convertible Bonds and hence Bondholders may lose part of their investment.Section 4 – Key information on the admission to tradingPoint 4.1 – Under which conditions and timetable can I invest in these securities?Structure of the Offering: the offer of the Convertible Bonds is carried out by way of a public offering  without preferential subscription rights for shareholders with a priority subscription period of four business days  which will enable them to subscribe in priority to the Convertible Bonds (i) on an irreducible basis up to the amount of their share in the share capital of the Company and (ii) on a reducible basis to a number of Convertible Bonds higher than the number to which they can subscribe on an irreducible basis  allocated in proportion to their irreducible applications and  in any event  up to the limit of their demand.Convertible Bonds not subscribed for  on an irreducible or a reducible basis  within the priority subscription period by shareholders will be offered to the public in a public offering in France (the “Public Offering”)  it being specified that Irata commits to subscribe the Offering for the entire Offering during the priority subscription period.

Legal framework of the Offering The Offering is being carried out by way of a public offering in France  except offerings as defined in paragraph 1 of article L.411-2 of the French Monetary and Financial Code  without preferential subscription rights for shareholders with a priority subscription period  in accordance with the 13th and 23rd resolutions adopted by the combined general meeting of shareholders of the Company held on September 27  2022. A priority subscription period of four business days  from May 25  2023 to May 30  2023 (included)  is granted to the shareholders whose shares are registered in their account on May 24  2023  which will enable them to subscribe in priority to the Convertible Bonds (i) on an irreducible basis up to the amount of their share in the share capital of the Company and (ii) on a reducible basis to a number of Convertible Bonds higher than the number to which they can subscribe on an irreducible basis  allocated in proportion to their irreducible applications and  in any event  up to the limit of their demand. This priority period is neither transferable nor negotiable. Convertible Bonds not subscribed for  on an irreducible or reducible basis  within the priority subscription period by shareholders will be offered to the public in the context of a public offering in France  it being specified that the Offering is subject to a subscription commitment by Irata LLC (“Irata”) for the entire amount of the convertible bond offering during the subscription period (the “Subscription Commitment”). Any orders received within the public offering are therefore likely not to be served. The subscription price of the Convertible Bonds under the priority subscription period will be equal to the subscription price of the Convertible Bonds in the public offering and is set at 0.15 euro per share. The subscription price per Convertible Bond shall be equal to the nominal value of each Convertible Bond  to be fully paid up in cash and/or by way of set-off of claims at the time of subscription. On the basis of the closing price of the Company's shares on May 23  2023  i.e. 0.1304 euro  the subscription price of one Convertible Bond of 0.15 euro represents a premium of 15%. Subscription commitment Irata  a 27.73% shareholder of the Company and held by Wade Rosen  chairman and CEO of Atari  has irrevocably undertaken in the Subscription Commitment to subscribe to the Offering during the priority subscription period of the Offering  on an irreducible basis  up to the amount of its stake in the Company's share capital (i.e. a total number of 55 460 000 Convertible Bonds) and on a reducible basis  up to the balance of the total amount of the Offering not subscribed by it on an irreducible basis  i.e. up to a maximum total amount (including conversion premium) of 21 681 000 euros (i.e.  up to 144 540 000 Convertible Bonds). Moreover  in the event that at the end of the subscription period of the Offering  the subscriptions do not represent 100% of the amount of the Offering  Irata has irrevocably and unconditionally undertaken to subscribe for the Convertible Bonds which will have not been fully paid by the subscribers  allowing for full subscription of this threshold of 100% of the principal amount of this convertible bonds offering  i.e. up to a maximum of 200 000 000 Convertible Bonds for an amount of 30 million euros. The amount of the Subscription Commitment will be paid  in priority  by way of set-off against due claims that Irata holds on the Company in respect of shareholders' loans previously granted  for an aggregate amount of €16 333 740.68 and the balance in cash. In addition  Irata has agreed not to convert the Convertible Bonds prior to June 30  2025 (date on which the triggering threshold for a mandatory tender offering on the Company's shares is raised from 30% to 50% of the shares and/or the voting rights)  provided that in the event of a tender offer on Atari's securities filed by a third party prior to June 30  2025  Irata will have the option to convert its Convertible Bonds prior to such date. As from January 1  2024  Irata also retains the right to convert its Convertible Bonds upon clearance by AMF (décision de conformité) of a tender offer on the Company's securities filed by Irata (or an affiliate). Use of proceeds On the basis of 100% of the Offering  the gross proceeds from the Offering will amount to approximately 30 million euros and the net proceeds will amount to 29 million euros  it being specified that Irata's subscription to the Offering will be made by way of debt set-off in respect of the repayment of shareholder loans up to its current amount of €16 333 740.68  thus reinforcing the balance sheet of the Company. The balance of the proceeds from the Offering will enable the Company to increase its financial flexibility and general corporate purposes in the context of the development of its transformation strategy: Continued investment in growth initiatives  notably with the on-going development of more than 12 new games that are expected to be launched in the next 18 months; andSeize additional acquisition of opportunities that may arise  including intellectual property rights and direct minority investment in companies offering value-added solutions for the Group. Prior to the Offering  the Company does not have sufficient consolidated net working capital to meet its current obligations for the next (12) months  including the expected contribution of Night Dive Studios. Based on current and planned development projects  notably given the expenses incurred for the ongoing development of new games  the Company will be able to fund its operations until the end of the month of June 2023  without taking into account the proceeds from the Offer. The net amount of additional cash required by the Company to meet its needs over the next 12 months amounts to around 4.5 million euros. Although the Company currently benefits from the continued financial support of its principal shareholder Irata through September 2023  the Offering is the preferred solution for the Company to finance its activity  it being specified that this transaction is subject to the firm and irrevocable Subscription Commitment by Irata covering 100% of the Offering amount. In the event of completion of the Offering  the Company will have sufficient consolidated net working capital to meet its cash requirements over the next twelve (12) months.

The pro forma consolidated financial position of Atari as of September 30  2022 has been prepared to illustrate the impact of the Acquisition and the related financing with retroactive effect to September 30  2022. The pro forma consolidated income statement of the Atari Group for the six-month period ended September 30  2022 has been prepared assuming that the Acquisition and its financing were completed on April 1  2022. The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information is based on a number of assumptions that Atari believes are reasonable as of the date of this document and in the context of the Acquisition. A detailed post-acquisition analysis may reveal differences in accounting principles that have not been taken into account in the preparation of the pro forma financial information. The pro forma financial information has not been audited by Atari’s statutory auditor and is based  in addition to the corresponding audited consolidated financial statements of Atari  on information prepared by Night Dive for the period ended on September 30  2022. In addition  the financial information of Night Dive used for the preparation of the pro forma financial information has not been audited and are not being audited in the United-States. As a result  undue reliance should not be placed on the unaudited pro forma financial information set forth in this Prospectus  which  beyond their illustrative nature  may not accurately reflect the current or future performance of the combined entity.

Point 3.2 – Where will the securities be traded? The Convertible Bonds will be admitted to trading on Euronext Growth within thirty (30) days following settlement and delivery. Point 3.3 - Is there a guarantee attached to the securities Not applicable Point 3.4 – What are the key risks that are specific to the securities? Main risk factors related to the securitiesBondholders are advised to consider the main key securities risks listed hereinafter: It is not certain that a market will develop for the Convertible Bonds : The Convertible Bonds will be admitted to trading on Euronext Growth within thirty (30) days following settlement and delivery. However  no assurance can be given that an active market for the Convertible Bonds will develop or that Bondholders will be able to sell their Convertible Bonds on such market at satisfactory price and liquidity  in particular given the fact that the main shareholder has undertaken to subscribe to 100% of the of the Convertible Bonds. In addition  if such a market were to develop  it cannot be excluded that the market price of the Convertible Bonds would be subject to significant volatility. If an active market does not develop  the liquidity and price of the Convertible Bonds will be affected. Finally  there is no obligation to make a market in the Convertible Bonds and the Company has not mandated any intermediary to ensure the liquidity of the Convertible Bonds. The Company may not be able to pay the interest or redeem the Convertible Bonds : The Company may not have sufficient financial capacity to pay the interest or redeem the Convertible Bonds. The Company's ability to pay interest and to redeem the Convertible Bonds will depend  among other things  on its financial situation at the time of payment of interest or redemption and may be limited by applicable law  by the terms of its indebtedness and  if applicable  by the terms of any new financing in place at that time that may replace  increase or modify the Company's existing or future debt. The market price of the Company’s shares may fluctuate and fall below the conversion price of the Convertible Bonds : The Company's shares may be traded at a price below the market price prevailing on the date of determination of the conversion price of the Convertible Bonds. The Company cannot provide any assurance that the Company's share market price will not fall below the such price. The Company's cannot provide any assurance that  subsequent to the conversion of the Convertible Bonds  investors will be able to sell their shares at a price at least equal to or greater than such price. The conversion of the Convertible Bonds or the sale of the shares resulting from the conversion of the Convertible Bonds on the market by bondholders is likely to have an adverse impact on the market price of the shares : The conversion of the Convertible Bonds or the sale of the shares resulting from the conversion of the Convertible Bonds by Bondholders is likely to have an adverse impact on the market price of the Company's shares. The Company cannot foresee the possible effects of these events on the market price of the shares. Bondholders have limited anti-dilution protection : The Conversion Ratio applicable in the event of conversion into new shares of the Convertible Bonds will only be adjusted in limited circumstances. Therefore  the Conversion Ratio will not be adjusted in all cases where an event relating to the Company or any other event would be likely to affect the value of the Company's shares or  more generally  to have a dilutive impact. The early redemption of the Convertible Bonds is subject to the approval of the Bondholders' meeting : In the event notably (i) of a breach by the Company of its obligations under the Convertible Bonds  (ii) cross default  (iii) preventive or collective insolvency proceeding or (iv) delisting of the Company's shares  the early redemption of the Convertible Bonds may only be triggered if a majority of the Bondholders have approved the request. Given Irata's subscription commitment and the significant holding of Convertible Bonds that could result  there is no guarantee that a vote in favor of early redemption will be obtained. Risk related to meetings and vote of Noteholders  modification and waivers: Certain provisions permit in certain cases defined majorities to bind all Bondholders including Bondholders who did not attend (or were not represented) and vote at the relevant general meeting  Bondholders who voted in a manner contrary to the majority and Bondholders who did not respond to  or rejected  the relevant resolution. If a decision is adopted by a majority of Bondholders and such modifications were to impair or limit the rights of the Bondholders  this may have a negative impact on the market value of the Convertible Bonds and hence Bondholders may lose part of their investment. Section 4 – Key information on the admission to tradingPoint 4.1 – Under which conditions and timetable can I invest in these securities?

CHAIRMAN’S COMMENTARY Dear Shareholder  During the past year  the world has seen rapidly increasing interest rates and rising inflation followed by significant issues in the banking sector in both the United States and Europe. Combined with recessionary fears in some of the larger economies  and generally less capital available for investments  these events have resulted in creating further uncertainty in global financial markets  the extent and impact of which remains uncertain. Overview During the year  Reinet completed its fifth share buyback programme with 2 325 979 ordinary shares being repurchased for some € 45 million during April and May 2022. Since November 2018  a total of 14 151 395 ordinary shares have been repurchased under five share buyback programmes. The cost of the ordinary shares repurchased amounts to € 222 million  plus transaction costs; an average cost of € 15.69 per share. With a net asset value of € 31.46 per share  the share buyback programmes have immediately created value for shareholders. At the annual general meeting in August 2022  shareholders renewed their approval for Reinet to buy back its own shares; future programmes will be considered taking into account cash resources  other commitments and market conditions. Reinet was pleased to commit $ 300 million to a new investment in tactical solutions funds managed by Coatue Management  a global investment firm focused on technology-related investment opportunities led by founder and portfolio manager Mr Philippe Laffont. Mr Laffont and Coatue have an outstanding reputation as investors in the technology space with Coatue managing some $ 42 billion in assets. I look forward to working with the team at Coatue in the years to come. Capital invested during the year amounted to some € 171 million  which was mostly in respect of funds managed by Trilantic Capital Partners  TruArc Partners and Coatue. Capital allocated to private equity partners over the last few years has resulted in the fair value of these funds  as a whole  now comprising some 20 per cent of Reinet’s net asset value. Reinet has cash resources of some € 288 million and access to the equivalent of £ 200 million in various currencies by way of additional borrowing facilities  to meet investment obligations and opportunities as they arise. Since its inception in 2008  Reinet has invested some € 3.5 billion in new investments and generated an annual return of 7.7 per cent for its investors based on the Reinet share price  with the underlying net asset value reflecting an 8.8 per cent compounded increase since March 2009. Results At 31 March 2023  Reinet’s net asset value amounted to € 5.7 billion  a decrease of € 170 million or 2.9 per cent from 31 March 2022. This primarily reflects the decrease in value of certain underlying investments; in particular the decrease in the share price of British American Tobacco over the year and the weakening of sterling against the euro; this was offset by dividend income from British American Tobacco  together with increases in the value of the fund investments in Trilantic Capital Partners and TruArc Partners. Business developments During the year  Reinet committed to invest an additional € 332 million  with € 324 million being in respect of new funds launched by Coatue  Asia Partners and Prescient  € 6 million in Pension Corporation and € 2 million in other smaller investments. Pension Corporation’s adjusted own funds remained stable at £ 5.9 billion  premiums were lower than the previous year reflecting in part the impact of higher interest rates  however profits increased and the balance sheet and solvency position remained strong. In February 2023  Pension Corporation announced that it had concluded a buy-in with the Trustees of two schemes sponsored by RSA Group  insuring in total some £ 6.5 billion of liabilities and covering the pensions of 40 000 members. This is the largest ever UK bulk annuity transaction and paves the way for other large transactions. The Board of Pension Corporation proposed an inaugural dividend of 7.5 pence per ordinary share which was paid to shareholders in May 2023. Reinet’s share of this dividend amounts to some £ 49.5 million. The investment in British American Tobacco decreased in value in the year due to its share price decreasing from £ 31.94 at 31 March 2022 to £ 28.41 at 31 March 2023. At the British American Tobacco annual general meeting in April 2023  shareholders approved a dividend increase of 6 per cent to £ 2.31 per share  up from £ 2.18 per share in 2022. British American Tobacco delivered strong results in 2022 and continues to follow its strategic path to ‘A Better Tomorrow’. With the appointment of Mr Tadeu Marroco as the new CEO in May 2023  British American Tobacco continues to build on its commitment to deliver long-term sustainable value for its shareholders. The value of investments in Reinet’s private equity partners increased by some 26 per cent in the year to € 1 138 million; capital invested amounted to some € 167 million  distributions to some € 56 million  realised gains to some € 25 million and fair value increases to some € 96 million. The underlying investments are mainly in the United States and Asia where financial markets have not performed well  however our partners have been successful at adding value in these challenging times. Dividend The Board of Directors of Reinet Investments Manager S.A. proposes a dividend of € 0.30 per share  payable in September 2023. This represents a 7 per cent increase from last year. Board of Overseers Mr Ian Whitecourt passed away in November 2022; Ian was a former Senior Partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers in Luxembourg and served on Reinet’s Board of Overseers from September 2009 to December 2014. Ian brought his considerable experience of the financial world to Reinet  in particular in the Luxembourg banking and investment fund areas. Outlook With continued high interest rates  elevated inflation  the ongoing Ukraine crisis  and instability in the global financial system the world economic growth forecast is on the decline with greater volatility expected. The additional financial sector stresses are already causing a noticeable slowdown in growth with inflation not expected to reach central bank target levels for some time to come. The global banking sector has faced considerable disruption in recent months; while neither Reinet nor its underlying investments have been significantly impacted  ongoing vigilance and reviews of banking relationships are essential. Similarly  Reinet continues to monitor the situation in Russia and Ukraine; and whilst there is no direct exposure  it considers any potential impacts on investment values. Overall  Reinet holds resilient investments and is well positioned to deal with these challenges. Environmental  Social and Corporate Governance and Corporate Social Responsibility will play an ever increasing part in our lives in the future  with enhanced ESG reporting on our door step  it continues to be an integral factor when considering new investments. Reinet considers it imperative for businesses to work responsibly  recognising that the world’s resources are finite and that everyone has a role to play in their conservation. As always  I am grateful to Reinet’s Directors  Overseers  management and employees for their continued commitment to Reinet over the past year and going forward.

Calculated using actual foreign exchange rates at transaction date. Total of realised proceeds and current fair value. The invested amount for Trilantic Capital Partners includes an initial payment of $ 10 million. PERFORMANCENET ASSET VALUE The NAV comprises total assets less total liabilities  and equates to total equity under International Financial Reporting Standards. The decrease in the NAV of € 170 million during the year reflects decreases in the fair value of British American Tobacco p.l.c. (‘BAT’)  Pension Insurance Corporation Group Limited  and other listed investments  offset by dividends received from BAT together with realised gains and increases in the estimated fair value of certain investments including  Trilantic Capital Partners and TruArc Partners. The Company funded the purchase of 2.3 million of its own ordinary shares through an approved buyback programme  the amount of which was already accrued at 31 March 2022. Details of the Company’s NAV and details of movements in key investments can be found on pages 4 and 5 of this report. Reinet records its assets and liabilities in euro; the weakening of sterling against the euro  offset by the strengthening of the US dollar against the euro has resulted in an overall decrease in the value of certain assets and liabilities in euro terms. Applying current year-end exchange rates to the March 2022 assets and liabilities would have resulted in a decrease in the March 2022 NAV of some € 174 million. SHARE BUYBACK PROGRAMME The fifth share buyback programme commenced in March 2022 and concluded on 23 May 2022  with 2 500 000 ordinary shares repurchased for € 49 million  plus transaction costs. During the year under review  2 325 979 ordinary shares were repurchased for some € 45 million  plus transaction costs. As at 31 March 2023  there was no share buyback programme in progress. The Company repurchased 14 151 395 ordinary shares between November 2018 and May 2022 under five share buyback programmes. The cost of the ordinary shares repurchased amounted to € 222 million  plus transaction costs. Details of each completed share buyback programme to date can be found in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. All ordinary shares repurchased are held as treasury shares. NET ASSET VALUE PER SHARE The NAV per share and the adjusted NAV per share of the Company are calculated by dividing the NAV and adjusted NAV by the number of shares outstanding (excluding treasury shares) of 181 790 891 (31 March 2022: 184 116 870). The adjusted NAV as at 31 March 2022 was calculated by reversing the liability in respect of future repurchases of shares of € 46 million. The adjusted NAV is considered relevant as it eliminates the timing difference between the additional liability recorded for future share repurchases and the actual number of shares repurchased as at 31 March 2022. No adjustment was made as at 31 March 2023 as there was no share buyback programme in progress at that date. 31 March 2023 31 March 2022 Shares in issue 195 942 286 195 942 286 Treasury shares (14 151 395) (11 825 416) Net shares 181 790 891 184 116 870 € m € m NAV (see page 4) 5 720 5 890 Reversal of future share buyback liability - 46 Adjusted NAV 5 720 5 936 € per share € per share NAV per share 31.46 31.99 Adjusted NAV per share 31.46 32.24 SHARE PRICE The Company’s indicative share price as quoted on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange decreased by 6.0 per cent in the year from € 20.00 at 31 March 2022 to € 18.80 at 31 March 2023  with the highest trade being at € 19.80 during the year. The total shareholder return since inception (taking into account the initial price of € 7.1945 and including dividends paid) is 7.7 per cent per annum. The growth in NAV  including dividends paid  reflects an 8.8 per cent compounded increase since March 2009. The Company’s ordinary shares are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange  Euronext Amsterdam and the Johannesburg Stock Exchange; the listing on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange is a secondary listing. Share prices as at 31 March 2023 and 31 March 2022 were as follows: 31 March 2023 31 March 2022 ZAR EUR ZAR EUR Luxembourg - 18.80 - 20.00 Amsterdam - 19.00 - 20.00 Johannesburg 365.06 - 327.76 - GLOBAL MARKETS BACKDROP During the year  global markets continued to be impacted by the effects of the ongoing Ukraine crisis  increasing interest rates and rising inflation. Whilst the world has made significant progress in its recovery from the impacts of COVID-19  general economic and geopolitical concerns remain elevated. The first quarter of 2023 saw increased market volatility as the collapse of US lender Silicon Valley Bank triggered concerns over the strength of the global financial sector; this was followed by UBS stepping in to take over Credit Suisse to prevent its collapse and JPMorgan Chase acquiring a substantial majority of assets and assuming the deposits and certain liabilities of First Republic Bank. These events resulted in creating further uncertainty in global financial markets. Rising inflation has resulted in significant pressure on households and consumers as many central banks continue to increase interest rates to mitigate the inflation concerns. The extent and impact of these factors remain uncertain. Reinet has no direct exposure to Russia or Ukraine through its underlying investments or banking relationships and has not experienced any significant direct impacts in respect of interest rate increases or rising inflation. Reinet has various banking relationships with highly rated institutions  and a well-diversified approach to cash and liquidity management. Reinet continues to value its investments in line with the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation (‘IPEV’) guidelines and its approved valuation procedures and methodologies. All investment valuations have been prepared using latest available data  including exchange rates and listed share prices as at 31 March 2023. Discussions have taken place with fund managers and investee companies to determine any significant changes in value and any impacts related to the Ukraine crisis  volatility in stock and currency markets  interest rates  inflation and exposure to certain financial institutions. Future valuations will take into account any new impacts of the above  which could affect the valuation of underlying investments. INVESTMENTS Reinet seeks  through a range of investment structures  to build partnerships with other investors  specialised fund managers and entrepreneurs to find and develop opportunities for long-term value creation for its shareholders. Since its formation in 2008  Reinet has invested some € 3.5 billion and at 31 March 2023 committed to provide further funding of € 627 million to its current investments. Details of the funding commitments outstanding are given in the table on page 16 of this report. New commitments during the year under review amounted to € 332 million  and a total of € 171 million was funded during the year. LISTED INVESTMENTS BRITISH AMERICAN TOBACCO P.L.C. The investment in BAT remains one of Reinet’s largest investments and is kept under constant review  considering the company’s performance  the industry outlook  cash flows from dividends  stock market performance  volatility and liquidity. Luc Jobin  Chairman  and Jack Bowles  Chief Executive  writing in the BAT annual report for 2022 commented: Luc Jobin: ‘2022 marks a year of great progress against the strategy at BAT  given the backdrop of an increasingly complex external environment. I am proud of the delivery of the business in 2022. Navigating a new economic cycle characterised by rising inflation  higher interest rates and a tight labour market  has required the business to be more adaptable than ever. Such complexities have been exacerbated by international conflict  political instability and supply chain constraints. In response  BAT has increased its focus on driving both a step change in New Categories and value from the combustibles business. Sustainability and ESG have long been an intrinsic part of BAT’s DNA. As part of our commitment to the UN-backed Race to Zero campaign  BAT published its Low-Carbon Transition Plan in 2022. This is the latest milestone in BAT’s journey to tackle climate change and to build ‘A Better Tomorrow’. Jack Bowles: ‘During 2022  the business demonstrated once again that it can transform while also delivering strong results. Revenue was up 7.7 per cent on 2021. New Categories have become a significant contributor to this  delivering £ 2 894 million in 2022 (up 40.9 per cent). We remain on track to meet our New Category revenue target of £ 5 billion by 2025  and now expect profitability by 2024  one year ahead of plan. At the centre of our strategy is our corporate purpose to build ‘A Better Tomorrow’. This means offering a greater choice of enjoyable and less risky products for our customers. 2022 shows that our strategy is working. We have strong  global New Category brands  targeted geographic expansion plans and an unwavering commitment to innovation that means we are delivering for the consumer. We have also made great progress on our existing ESG commitments this year and I was delighted with the appointment of our first Chief Sustainability Officer in August 2022 further embedding our decades-long commitment to sustainability.’ During the year under review  dividend income recorded from BAT amounted to € 122 million (£ 107 million)  being BAT’s second  third and fourth 2022 quarterly dividends  together with the first 2023 quarterly dividend of some € 31 million (£ 28 million) with a record date of 24 March 2023. The first 2023 quarterly dividend was paid on 3 May 2023 and has been included as a receivable in the NAV as at 31 March 2023  due to the record date falling within the financial year. Reinet holds 48.3 million shares in BAT (31 March 2022: 48.3 million)  representing some 2.16 per cent of BAT’s issued share capital. The value of Reinet’s investment in BAT amounted to € 1 561 million at 31 March 2023 (31 March 2022: € 1 832 million)  being some 27.3 per cent of Reinet’s NAV. The decrease in value reflects the decrease in the BAT share price on the London Stock Exchange from £ 31.94 at 31 March 2022 to £ 28.41 at 31 March 2023 together with the weakening of sterling against the euro during the year.

In determining fair value  Reinet Fund Manager S.A. (the ‘Fund Manager’) relies on audited and unaudited financial statements of investee companies  management reports and valuations provided by third-party experts. Valuation methodologies applied include the NAV of investment funds  discounted cash flow models and comparable valuation multiples  as appropriate. The third-party valuation reports and key assumptions used within these reports are reviewed by the external auditors. PENSION INSURANCE CORPORATION GROUP LIMITED Pension Insurance Corporation Group Limited’s (‘Pension Corporation’) wholly-owned subsidiary  Pension Insurance Corporation plc (‘Pension Insurance Corporation’)  is a leading provider in the UK pension risk transfer market. During 2022  Pension Insurance Corporation concluded new business with premiums of £ 4.1 billion (2021: £ 4.7 billion) including for long-term clients IMI and British American Tobacco. The reduction in premium levels reflecting in part the impact of higher interest rates. At 31 December 2022  Pension Insurance Corporation reported it held £ 41.0 billion in assets (31 December 2021: £ 51.1 billion). The decrease in value is due to rising yields which lead to lower asset values and also to lower liability values. As at 31 December 2022  insurance liabilities declined to £ 33.0 billion (FY2021: £47.0 billion). To date  Pension Insurance Corporation has insured 302 200 pension fund members (31 December 2021: 282 900). Clients include FTSE 100 companies  multinationals and the public sector. Pension Insurance Corporation has a total of £ 1.6 billion Tier 2 subordinated notes and £ 450 million Tier 1 restricted notes outstanding. In March 2023  Fitch affirmed its Insurer Financial Strength rating at A+ (Strong) and Long-Term Issuer Default rating at A. The reported Solvency II capital ratio as at 31 December 2022 was 225 per cent (31 December 2021: 168 per cent). The Board of Pension Corporation proposed an inaugural dividend for 2022 of 7.50 pence per ordinary share (2021: nil). The dividend was paid on 10 May 2023. Reinet has not recorded a receivable as at 31 March 2023  as the approval date falls outside this financial year. Reinet’s shareholding in Pension Corporation increased from 49.4 per cent at 31 March 2022 to 49.5 per cent at 31 March 2023 as a result of a secondary share purchase transaction in the amount of some £ 4.8 million. Tracy Blackwell  Chief Executive Officer and Dom Veney  Chief Financial Officer of Pension Insurance Corporation  commented: Tracy Blackwell: ‘We ended the year with a robust balance sheet  very high customer satisfaction levels  and a huge market opportunity before us. Our purpose  which is to pay the pensions of our current and future policyholders  ensures that we always protect our balance sheet and prioritise risk management  as well as helping us evolve our investment strategy as we seek cash flows to match future pension payments  which stretch decades into the future. As a business with a very long-term outlook  we seek to develop ongoing relationships with our clients and investment partners  a theme which is noticeable in this year’s results. The scale of our investments mean that we are increasingly being recognised for our growing impact across the country  and the social value these investments generate. In February 2023 we announced the largest bulk annuity transaction to date. The deal was driven by the rise in gilt yields during 2022. During the first half of the year this meant that defined benefit pension schemes were becoming better funded and closer to being able to buy out even before the Liability Driven Investment crisis. However  the rapid increase in yields following the ‘mini-budget’  even where they fell back somewhat in the following weeks  had the overall effect of significantly reducing scheme deficits  bringing forward by several years trustees’ de-risking plans. This has resulted in an exciting pipeline of new business for 2023 and beyond.’ Dom Veney: ‘IFRS profit before tax of £ 1 240 million (2021: £ 393 million) benefitted from favourable investment variances. Our hedging strategy is primarily calibrated to stabilise our solvency position rather than the IFRS balance sheet. This better reflects how we manage the business but can cause short-term volatility within the IFRS results. Operating profit remained strong at £ 388 million (2021: £ 533 million). Underlying profit grew by 44 per cent to £ 654 million (2021: £ 455 million) from higher returns on surplus assets and new business profits  but this was more than offset by £ 315 million of favourable assumption changes which increased AOPBT in 2021 but which were not repeated in 2022. Looking ahead  while the volatile market conditions and evolving regulatory environment are expected to persist in the short-term  our disciplined approach to underwriting  prudent investment strategy and robust financial position mean that we are well positioned for the upcoming market opportunities. We have made a strong start to 2023  having recently completed the UK’s single largest pension risk transfer deal to date for estimated premiums of £ 6.5 billion. Following full implementation of the transaction  PIC’s long-term solvency ratio would remain above 200 per cent  based on economic conditions at 31 December 2022.’ Reinet’s investment in Pension Corporation is carried at an estimated fair value of € 2 787 million at 31 March 2023 (31 March 2022: € 2 796 million). This value takes into account Pension Corporation’s audited adjusted equity own funds value at 31 December 2022 of £ 5.9 billion (31 December 2021: £ 5.9 billion)  corresponding valuation multiples drawn from industry data for a selected UK insurance peer group as at 31 March 2023  and a discount of 10 per cent which takes into account the illiquid nature of Reinet’s investment. The decrease in Reinet’s estimated fair value of Pension Corporation over the year is mainly due to the of weakening of sterling against the euro in the year  most of which was offset by an increase in comparable company multiples derived from public information of listed peer group companies in the UK insurance sector. The investment in Pension Corporation represents some 48.7 per cent of Reinet’s NAV at 31 March 2023  compared to 47.5 per cent at 31 March 2022. On 27 February 2023  Pension Corporation announced that it had concluded a buy-in with the Trustees of two schemes sponsored by RSA Group  insuring in total some £ 6.5 billion of liabilities and covering the pensions of 40 000 members. RSA Group is a wholly owned subsidiary of Intact Financial Corporation. This is the largest ever UK bulk annuity transaction and paves the way for other large transactions as part of the anticipated increase in volumes of new business coming to market.

PRIVATE EQUITY AND RELATED PARTNERSHIPS Where Reinet invests in funds managed by third parties its philosophy is to partner with the managers of such funds and to share in fees generated by funds under management. This is the case with funds managed by Trilantic Capital Partners  TruArc Partners  Milestone Capital and Prescient Investment Management China. Under the terms of the investment advisory agreement (the ‘Investment Advisory Agreement’)  entered into by the Fund Manager and Reinet Investment Advisors Limited (the ‘Investment Advisor’)  Reinet pays no management fee to the Investment Advisor on such investments except in the case where no fee or a reduced fee below 1 per cent is paid to the third-party manager. In such cases  the aggregate fee payable to the Investment Advisor and the third-party manager is capped at 1 per cent. TRILANTIC CAPITAL PARTNERS TRILANTIC CAPITAL PARTNERS Trilantic Capital Partners (‘Trilantic’) is composed of Trilantic North America and Trilantic Europe  two separate and independent private equity investment advisors focused on making controlling and significant minority interest investments in companies in their respective geographies. Trilantic North America currently targets investments in the business services and consumer sectors  and currently manages five fund families. Trilantic Europe primarily targets investments in the industrials  consumer and leisure  telecommunication  media and technology  business services and healthcare sectors  and currently manages three fund families. Reinet and its minority partner invest in certain of the Trilantic general partnerships and management companies (together ‘Trilantic Management’). Reinet and its minority partner  through Reinet TCP Holdings Limited  invest in two of the current funds under Trilantic’s management. Reinet also directly invests in four additional funds under Trilantic’s management. The terms of investment applicable to Reinet’s investment in the Trilantic funds provide that Reinet will not pay any management fees or carried interest. In addition  Reinet receives a share of the carried interest payable on the realisation of investments held in the funds  once a hurdle rate has been achieved. Reinet TCP Holdings Limited invests in Trilantic Capital Partners IV L.P. (‘Fund IV’) and Trilantic Capital Partners IV (Europe) L.P.; these funds are in the process of realising the remaining underlying investments. In 2012  Reinet invested in Trilantic Capital Partners V (North America) L.P. (‘Fund V’) and in 2014  in Trilantic Energy Partners (North America) L.P. (‘TEP I’). These US-based funds are focused on North American opportunities with TEP I being especially focused on the energy industry sector. Both funds are in the process of realising the remaining underlying investments. In 2017  Reinet invested in Trilantic Capital Partners VI Parallel (North America) L.P. (collectively with its parallel vehicles  ‘Fund VI’) and Trilantic Energy Partners II Parallel (North America) L.P. (collectively with its parallel vehicles ‘TEP II’). These US-based funds are focused on North American opportunities with TEP II being especially focused on the energy industry sector. Charlie Ayres  Chairman of Trilantic North America and the Executive Committee of Trilantic Capital Partners  commented: ‘2022 was a difficult year for financial assets  with ‘worst performance since 2008’ pervasive in describing performance. Many (former) technology darlings lost significant value. The Nasdaq fell 33 per cent on the year  outpacing losses in the S&P 500 Index and Dow Jones Industrial Average  down 19 per cent and 9 per cent  respectively. Risk appetite has not completely dried up in the face of uncertainty and volatility. Trends in earnings and future guidance  as well as messaging from the Fed  will likely shape public market performance over the coming months. Despite significant losses in public markets in 2022  many private equity valuations have not yet experienced significant markdowns. Our active companies remain under-levered with healthy balance sheets and we continue to focus on finding asymmetric risk / reward opportunities to deploy capital. Key highlights from the past year include: Completed 5 significant realisations with total proceeds of $ 762 million Fund VI North America deployed $ 212 million into 2 new platform investments Experienced aggregate portfolio accretion of $ 878 million during 2022 Continued to source attractive add-on investments for our platform companies.We are on track to publish our 3rd Annual ESG Report in May 2023; this report will provide an update on our progress both within the Firm and within our portfolio  where we have focused on key KPIs  influenced by ILPA’s ESG Convergence project; we are proud to be signatories to both the U.N. Principals for Responsible Investing and ILPA’s diversity in action initiative. Key 2023 objectives: We aim to monetize 1 to 3 of our current investments during 2023  subject to market conditions. We remain focused on finding 2 to 5 new investment opportunities per year at a typical equity check size of $ 100 million to $ 300 million.’ Trilantic North America launched Trilantic Capital Partners VII Parallel (North America) L.P. (collectively with its parallel vehicles  ‘Fund VII’) as a successor fund to Fund IV  Fund V and Fund VI  and Reinet committed to invest up to 9.9 per cent of total commitments in Fund VII  with an expected final commitment of some $ 297 million. In April 2022  Fund VII held its first closing; however  it has not called capital to date. Trilantic North America recently announced that Fund VII is now expected to be a smaller bridge fund to Fund VIII. In light of this  Reinet and Trilantic North America agreed that Reinet would not commit capital to Fund VII  however  Reinet would retain its rights to invest on preferential terms in future funds. Vittorio Pignatti-Morano  Chairman of Trilantic Europe  commented: ‘2022 was the 15th year of Trilantic Europe as an independent company and it was a year of change. A dramatic and unexpected full-scale European conflict  the Russian invasion of Ukraine  created a worldwide escalation of gas and oil prices. The resulting inflationary pressure on energy was additive to the embedded ‘COVID-19 exit’ inflationary pressure arising from the prior two years of extensive government subsidies to individuals and companies. It’s not clear for how long this period of higher interest rates and higher inflation will last but it will be years not months. For the USA and Europe  2022 crystallised the end of two decades of growing global trade which were a great deflator for the western economies which  by outsourcing production to lower-cost emerging economies  were importing cheaper goods and services. Although already seeing reduced inflation  all this represents a paradigm change for the world of investments in general and for private equity in particular. At Trilantic Europe we are dealing with these changes. We have analysed in depth our existing portfolio  the skills that our portfolio managers need  the new investments we should consider and those we should de-emphasise. Our ESG focus that has been at the forefront of our investing for over a decade  is now better channelled into our portfolio companies  making the impact much greater.’ Reinet’s investment in Trilantic Management and the above funds is carried at the estimated fair value of € 472 million at 31 March 2023 (31 March 2022: € 385 million) of which € 2 million (31 March 2022: € 2 million) is attributable to the minority partner. The estimated fair value is based on audited valuation data provided by Trilantic Management at 31 December 2022 adjusted for changes in the value of listed investments included in the portfolios and cash movements up to 31 March 2023. The increase in the estimated fair value reflects capital contributions of € 22 million and increases in estimated fair values of underlying investments together with the strengthening of the US dollar against the euro in the year  offset by distributions of € 44 million. During the year under review  gains of € 21 million (31 March 2022: € 6 million) and carried interest of € 6 million (31 March 2022: € 8 million) were realised.

We completed the acquisition of two new platform companies in Fund IV  bringing the total to five platform companies in that fund. Each company fits well within TruArc’s transformational growth approach  and multiple growth initiatives are well underway. A key component of our investment approach is to execute a ‘buy and build’ value creation strategy  and during 2022 we completed 20 strategically important and financially accretive add-on acquisitions across the TruArc-managed portfolio companies. TruArc’s active  operational approach has allowed us to strengthen our portfolio company positions in their respective markets despite the dynamic operating environment driven by supply chain issues  labour challenges  inflation  and rising interest rates. Despite the continued market turbulence and challenging operating environment  we are encouraged by how well our management teams are effectively leading our portfolio companies as they navigate these evolving markets and execute their growth initiatives. We are working closely with our management teams to build value through transformational growth across the TruArc portfolio.’ Reinet’s investment is carried at an estimated fair value of € 301 million at 31 March 2023 (31 March 2022: € 202 million)  based on the audited valuation data provided by TruArc at 31 December 2022 adjusted for cash movements up to 31 March 2023.

In October 2022  Reinet committed a total of € 278 million ($ 300 million) to two funds managed by Coatue Management L.L.C.  € 139 million ($ 150 million) to Coatue Structured Offshore Feeder Fund LP and € 139 million ($ 150 million) to Coatue Tactical Solutions CT Offshore Fund B LP (together the ‘Coatue Structured Funds’). Both funds follow the same investment strategy. The Coatue Structured Funds will seek to invest in structured investments in both publicly listed and privately held technology companies that offer downside protection  while retaining upside potential. The Coatue Structured Funds will focus on privately negotiated transactions leveraging Coatue’s sector experience and platform resources to source proprietary transactions. Coatue will seek to employ a strategy that will opportunistically fund both offensive and defensive transactions such as M&A  and establishing paths toward accelerating organic growth  among other paths. Coatue believes there is a substantial universe of potential investment opportunities and that the market could produce significant structured capital opportunities. Coatue will typically seek to lead transactions and assert control over deal structure  terms  and price. The majority of transactions will aim to be proprietary – not through a marketed offering – and are expected to aim to avoid mark-to-market volatility. Coatue generally intends to focus on companies that are: 1) powered by a strong underlying trend; 2) established winners or breakout leaders within a category or trend; 3) pursuing a large total addressable market; 4) operating business models with strong unit economics; and 5) led by visionary founders and top-notch management teams. In the approximately nine months since launch  the Coatue Structured Funds have deployed more than $ 600 million across eight transactions. Reinet’s investment is carried at an estimated fair value of € 50 million at 31 March 2023 (31 March 2022: € nil)  based on the audited valuation data provided by Coatue at 31 December 2022 adjusted for cash movements up to 31 March 2023.

Current areas of investment include: domestic consumer brands  biopharmaceutical manufacturers  medical device manufacturers  big data services and e-commerce. Yunli Lou  Managing Partner of Milestone Capital  commented: ‘During 2022  Milestone Capital continued working closely with our portfolio companies to achieve exits. We continued selling down our shares in a listed cosmetics e-commerce platform  and also started the sales process of our stake in a medical consumable company. In 2022  China’s economy and social activities were negatively impacted by COVID-19. Full year GDP was $ 17.5 trillion  up by only 3.0 per cent year-on-year  while total retail sales of consumer goods posted a 0.2 per cent year-on-year decline. Capital markets performance was weak as well  impacted by the weakened economy and sentiment. Starting in November 2022 after China’s top leadership reshuffle  China relaxed its zero-COVID policy and started reopening. The number of COVID-19 infections quickly peaked in late December 2022  and since early 2023  daily life and social activities have returned to normal. The government has set a 5.0 per cent GDP growth rate target for 2023  while making economic growth the top priority in setting policies  particularly in consumption  manufacturing  and energy transition sectors.’ The investment in Milestone is held at the estimated fair value of € 44 million (31 March 2022: € 50 million) based on audited financial information provided by Milestone Capital at 31 December 2022 adjusted for movements in listed investments and cash movements up to 31 March 2023.

Prescient China funds and management company Reinet invests in the Prescient China Equity Fund  the Prescient China Balanced Fund  the Prescient China Growth Enhanced Absolute Return Fund and the management company. The Prescient China Equity Fund uses a systematic  quantitative approach to seek long-term capital growth by investing primarily in China ‘A’ shares listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges by virtue of Prescient’s Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor status granted by the China Securities Regulatory Commission. Prescient China Balanced Fund invests in equities following a similar strategy to the Prescient China Equity Fund and also in bonds  cash and derivatives with the objective of generating inflation-beating returns at acceptable risk levels. In May 2022  Reinet committed to invest in the newly launched Prescient China Growth Enhanced Absolute Return Fund. The fund aims to achieve long-term capital growth at significantly lower return volatility than conventional multi-asset China investment strategies. The fund will predominantly invest in mainland Chinese equities  bonds  cash  money market instruments and derivatives. Reinet invested € 11 million ($ 12 million) during the year. All funds are managed by a subsidiary of Prescient Limited (‘Prescient’)  a South African fund manager  with the team based in Shanghai. Liang Du  Portfolio Manager of Prescient  commented: ‘Over the past year China faced its most challenging year yet since the Chinese financial crisis of 2015. Omicron's fast transmissibility resulted in COVID being out of control in China for the first time  COVID zero policy in major cities combined with extremely cumbersome COVID controls dramatically dampened economic activity as well as household sentiment throughout the country. The combination of COVID zero  negative sentiment would further impact the already slowing property sector  resulting in the large property developer defaults. Geopolitical concerns also remain at the forefront. All of this would result in Chinese stocks hitting the lows of 2008 levels  with low single digit PE multiples in October 2023. President Xi secured his 3rd term and  policy movement post event as well as cabinet appointments surprised many. By and large the majority of new cabinet members were technocrats and historically business friendly. As Omicron became widespread for the second time in December 2022  COVID zero policies was also abandoned extremely quickly resulting in the complete dismantling of COVID-19 policies in a few weeks. Low inflation  low interest rates as well as end of COVID zero saw a strong economic recovery in China in the first quarter of 2023.Over the past year the Prescient Funds navigated some of the most difficult financial markets well  both funds were exceedingly competitive against their respective peer group and performed very well under extremely difficult conditions  with our flagship China Balanced Fund reaching it's 10-year anniversary in March 2023. The fund is comfortably in the top decile in its category and delivered returns of 8.5 per cent annualised over the past decade. In spite of China's capital markets having a pretty tough time  the fund still delivered extremely strong real returns and almost double the return of just a passive equivalent. Our Equity Fund will see it's 5-year anniversary in October 2023  it has also beaten more than 80 per cent of its peer group since inception. We continue to follow our philosophy and process to invest in China and hope that we will deliver for clients over the next decade what we have done over the last.’ Reinet’s total investment is carried at an estimated fair value of € 143 million based on unaudited financial information provided by Prescient at 31 March 2023 (31 March 2022: € 143 million). The estimated fair value reflects capital contributions of € 11 million together with the strengthening of the US dollar against the euro in the year  offset by decreases in the value of underlying investments.

Asia Partners I LP is the inaugural fund of Asia Partners Fund Management Pte. Ltd (‘Asia Partners’)  a Singapore-based growth equity investment firm. Asia Partners II LP was launched in April 2022. Asia Partners bases its investment strategy on the long-term growth potential of Southeast Asia  the rapid growth of innovative technology and technology-enabled businesses in the region  and target investments in the $ 20 million to $ 80 million range  often described as the ‘Series C/D Gap’ between early-stage venture capital and the public capital markets. Oliver Rippel  Co-Founder and Partner of Asia Partners  commented: ‘We continue to be excited about the Southeast Asia region. Five out of the six key countries in the region outperformed US equities by at least 800 basis points in 2022. Three out of the six had higher real GDP growth than inflation in 2022. Demographics favour Southeast Asia  as well: the total population of 15 to 35-year-olds in Southeast Asia peaks after both China and India.With this macro backdrop  we have seen a significant number of next generation tech companies across the region not only scale their business  but most importantly generate strong gross profits and near-term profitability. Our objective is to support these businesses through our investment and value-add and ultimately help them transition to become sizeable public companies.’ In April 2022  Reinet committed € 30 million ($ 31 million) to Asia Partners II LP as part of the first close. This amount increased to € 35 million ($ 37 million) through December 2022 and is expected to increase further at subsequent fund closings. An initial investment of some € 7 million ($ 8 million) was made in July 2022. The investment in Asia Partners funds is held at the estimated fair value of € 32 million (31 March 2022: € 20 million) based on audited financial information provided by the fund manager at 31 December 2022 adjusted for cash movements up to 31 March 2023. The increase in the estimated fair value reflects capital contributions of € 10 million  increases in the value of underlying investments together with the strengthening of the US dollar against the euro in the year.

UNITED STATES LAND DEVELOPMENT AND MORTGAGES Reinet has invested in certain real estate development projects and related businesses located in the United States (including Florida  North Carolina and South Carolina). Reinet has also purchased mortgage debt associated with such developments from financial institutions  usually at significant discounts to face value. The core land development process encompasses land planning  attaining entitlements from governmental bodies and installation of community infrastructure. Other investments in mitigation banks facilitate the preservation of land to offset the loss of wetlands necessitated by public improvements  such as highway construction  and other privately-sponsored developments. Bill Lanius  Chief Executive Officer of United States land development and mortgages  commented: ‘In the past year  our industry has witnessed a moderation in housing demand caused by significant mortgage rate increases and general economic uncertainty  primarily stemming from the inflationary surge. Furthermore  lingering supply chain issues and heightened governmental regulation resulted in extended production cycles. Despite these challenges  the demographics that support long-term housing demand remain favourable  particularly in Florida and other sunbelt locations in which our portfolio of properties is concentrated. During our most recent fiscal year  the United States land development and mortgages business finalized key transactions and solidified important business relationships that will facilitate future operations. The results are consistent with our strategy of monetizing designated assets and distributing surplus capital to Reinet. Based on our progress to date  we cautiously enter the new fiscal year as a streamlined operation with greater ability to respond to changing economic circumstances.’ The investment is carried at the estimated fair value of € 26 million as at 31 March 2023 (31 March 2022: € 32 million). The current valuation is based on audited and unaudited financial statements as at 31 December 2022 adjusted for cash movements up to 31 March 2023. The decrease in the estimated fair value reflects repayments received during the year of € 11 million  offset by increases in the valuation of underlying assets together with the strengthening of the US dollar against the euro during the year. OTHER INVESTMENTS Other investments are carried at their estimated fair value of € 58 million at 31 March 2023 (31 March 2022: € 81 million). The decrease in the estimated fair value relates to decreases in the valuation of underlying investments and the weakening of sterling against the euro in the year  offset by amounts invested together with the strengthening of the US dollar against the euro in the year. COMMITTED DURING THE YEAR Commitments made in the year amounted to € 332 million  including € 278 million ($ 300 million) to Coatue funds  € 11 million ($ 12 million) to Prescient China Growth Enhanced Absolute Return Fund and € 35 million ($ 37 million) to Asia Partners II LP.

Reinet’s liquidity is measured by its ability to meet potential cash requirements  including unfunded commitments on investments and the repayment of borrowings  and at 31 March 2023 can be summarised as follows: Cash and liquid funds € 288 m Undrawn borrowing facilities € 227 m Cash required for unfunded commitments (refer to table on previous page) (€ 627 m) Cash required to meet GBP borrowing obligations (€ 227 m) The undrawn borrowing facilities comprise a revolving facility with Bank of America  N.A. and with Citibank N.A. (see below). Reinet may sell further BAT shares or use such shares to secure additional financing facilities from time to time. BANK BORROWINGS BORROWINGS BORROWINGS Reinet has a fixed-rate £ 100 million margin loan due to Citibank N.A.  which is repayable in August 2024. At 31 March 2023  the estimated fair value of the loan amounted to € 108 million (31 March 2022: € 114 million). In addition  Reinet has a fixed-rate £ 100 million margin loan due to Bank of America  N.A.  which is repayable in March 2025. At 31 March 2023  the estimated fair value of the loan amounted to € 109 million (31 March 2022: € 119 million). The decrease in the estimated fair value of both loans reflects the increase in the discount rates used (due to increases in market interest rates) together with the weakening of sterling in the period. Some 13.8 million BAT shares have been pledged to collateralise these two loans. In addition  Reinet has a facility agreement in place with Citibank N.A. up to August 2024 and with Bank of America  N.A. up to March 2025. These facilities allow Reinet to drawdown the equivalent of up to € 227 million (£ 200 million) in a combination of currencies to fund further investment commitments. As at 31 March 2023 no funds have been drawn under these facilities.

Borrowings are carried at estimated fair value reflecting the discounted cash flow value of future principal and interest payments taking into account prevailing interest rates.

25361,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://www.finews.com/news/english-news/57496-jan-brzezek-crypro-finance-deutsche-boerse-blockchain-finance,Jan Brzezek: «Blockchain is Set to Transform Traditional Finance»,Traditional finance must collaborate with DeFi  recognizing the benefits of adopting blockchain technology. Deutsche Börse’s 2021 acquisition of Crypto Finance is a sign of things to come. The Group monitors different areas with a view to buying well ...,I am convinced that the future of finance lies in the broader adoption of public blockchains  Jan Brzezek writes in an article for finews.first.This article has been published on finews.first  a forum for authors specializing in economic and financial topics.I expect every bank in Switzerland will be offering cryptocurrencies in the next two years and every bank in Europe in the next five years. They will then progress to tokenize assets like art and real estate within 10 to 15 years. And  lastly  I think decentralized finance (DeFi) based on blockchain technology has the potential to transform banking’s entire value chain over the next 30 years  bringing the benefits of lower fees and increased transparency to all aspects of finance.While cryptocurrencies are known for their volatility  in fact  blockchain technology may help to make the financial system more robust. 2023’s wave of bank failures has revealed how e-banking apps and real-time withdrawals have left banks more vulnerable. But using smart contracts instead of traditional methods of settlement would reduce counterparty risk by making settlement immediate rather it is taking two days. What’s more  it would increase transparency at a time when finance is becoming increasingly complex.«What will it take for traditional finance and crypto finance to converge?»The potential of decentralized finance (DeFi) is immense across lending  borrowing  and investment. The most tangible use case is digital assets like Bitcoin  which can be transferred around the world 24 hours a day  seven days a week. But beyond that are tokenized assets. They allow you to issue a token in less bankable assets like art  cars  or houses. With the expansion of ebanking you could have a wealth portal including all of an individual’s assets. Clients would start to interact with their banks completely differently  in a much more passionate way.Turning to intellectual property  tokenization would enable a pharmaceutical company to directly fund costly research and development. Right now  if you want to invest in the development of a COVID-19 vaccine  for instance  you need to invest in Pfizer. But Pfizer could issue tokens against specific drug development programs  which investors could then buy.What will it take for traditional finance and crypto finance to converge? Regulation of digital assets is the most important first step. Just a few weeks ago  the European Union introduced its well-designed Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) Regulation: a game changer that will lead to a wave of product innovation. Both the UK and Hong Kong are also preparing regulations  while unfortunately  the US has so far not agreed on a specific way forward.«For DeFi to achieve its full potential  there must be interoperability between blockchains»Europe’s financial institutions have largely been waiting for regulatory certainty before offering cryptocurrencies to their clients  which is the first step towards convergence. Now many of them will do so  catching up with the many Swiss financial intermediaries that started to offer such services after Switzerland introduced crypto regulations in 2021.Regulation will lead to consolidation as smaller  offshore crypto firms close or merge with more established firms that can comply with the new requirements. At the same time  some big established financial companies are getting into the market. They can afford to charge less or scale up better than start-ups.Collaboration is also required for convergence. Traditional finance must collaborate with DeFi  recognizing the benefits of adopting blockchain technology. Deutsche Börse’s 2021 acquisition of Crypto Finance is a sign of things to come. The Group monitors different areas with a view to buying well-run companies that can extend their existing value chain. A lot of its trade and post-trade operations could be run on the blockchain in years to come  boosting efficiency  lowering cost  and increasing transparency.But for DeFi to achieve its full potential  there must be interoperability between blockchains with different use cases. For instance  secure bridges must join up central bank digital currencies  stablecoins  and smart contract platforms.«It’s going to be a complex process»I would be surprised if any bank or asset management company's board did not explore the potential of crypto assets  tokenization  or blockchain technology generally. It’s clear to me that the adoption rate is rising. People have realized that digital assets and it’s underlying technology is not going away. So they are looking for ways to adopt it into their business models.There is an opportunity to embrace the best of traditional and crypto finance. Over time  blockchain technology will transform traditional finance  helping to reduce the risk in the system. But it’s going to be a complex process  which requires time  risk risk-taking  and the willingness of all stakeholders to innovate.Jan Brzezek is the CEO and founder of Swiss-based Crypto Finance and a board member of Crypto Finance (Asset Management).

25362,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/dboey-ndaq-better-value-stock-154007232.html,DBOEY or NDAQ: Which Is the Better Value Stock Right Now?,There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks  but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns.,DBOEY or NDAQ: Which Is the Better Value Stock Right Now?Investors interested in Securities and Exchanges stocks are likely familiar with Deutsche Boerse AG (DBOEY) and Nasdaq (NDAQ). But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks  but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends  and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Right now  Deutsche Boerse AG is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy)  while Nasdaq has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This means that DBOEY's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive  so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. However  value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional  tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio  P/S ratio  earnings yield  cash flow per share  and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.DBOEY currently has a forward P/E ratio of 16.48  while NDAQ has a forward P/E of 19.64. We also note that DBOEY has a PEG ratio of 1.23. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio  but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. NDAQ currently has a PEG ratio of 4.42.Another notable valuation metric for DBOEY is its P/B ratio of 3.48. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value  which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison  NDAQ has a P/B of 4.22.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to DBOEY's Value grade of B and NDAQ's Value grade of D.DBOEY sticks out from NDAQ in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models  so value investors will likely feel that DBOEY is the better option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This partnership should increase the performance of GAUSSIN vehicles and accelerate their market launch. For PLASTIC OMNIUM  the agreement increases the scope of its technology and puts its know-howat the service of pioneers in zero-emissionmobility. A strategic partnership for port applications The contract signed by GAUSSIN and PLASTIC OMNIUM provides for cooperation between the two players with a view to integrating PLASTIC OMNIUM's complete hydrogen systems into GAUSSIN's APM® vehicles. Innovation is at the heart of this partnership and opens up promising prospects  with a hydrogen solution for carbon-free mobility applications in ports. PLASTIC OMNIUM's complete hydrogen systemsGAUSSIN's APM® for port operations Promising synergies Convinced since 2015 that hydrogen will play a decisive role in tomorrow's clean mobility  Plastic Omnium has invested more than €300 million since 2015 to expand its expertise and industrial footprint across the hydrogen value chain. As the leader in this technology  Plastic Omnium plans to invest an average of €100 million each year to reach €3 billion in revenue by 2030. These innovations  in the service of zero-emission mobility  position Plastic Omnium as a partner of choice for GAUSSIN for APM® in the port sector. This agreement follows a similar strategic agreement in hydrogen with Plug Power in the logistics sector with the ATM® vehicle. Hydrogen  an energy source adapted to off-road applications Closed sites  and in particular ports  are perfectly suited to hydrogen eco-systems. Indeed  they are home to large vehicle fleets which  on their own  are sufficient to install a hydrogen production and distribution unit. GAUSSIN's AMP H2 port tractor is an immediate response to this clean mobility opportunity for the port sector. ""This partnership with PLASTIC OMNIUM is another important step in the development of GAUSSIN's range of hydrogen vehicles. While GAUSSIN was rewarded at the Monaco Hydrogen Forum in 2022 for its hydrogen offer for port actors  the cooperation agreement with PLASTIC OMNIUM further strengthens our positioning  by enabling us to rely on the cutting-edge technology of this key partner in the automotive industry. This partnership should enable us to accelerate the market launch of our APM® hydrogen range and maintain our technological lead in this key sector for tomorrow's clean mobility "" said Christophe Gaussin  CEO of GAUSSIN.

Moreover  in the event that at the end of the subscription period of the Offering  the subscriptions do not represent 100% of the amount of the Offering  Irata has irrevocably and unconditionally undertaken to subscribe for the Convertible Bonds which will have not been fully paid by the subscribers  allowing for full subscription of this threshold of 100% of the principal amount of this convertible bonds offering  i.e. up to a maximum of 200 000 000 Convertible Bonds for an amount of 30 million euros.The amount of the Subscription Commitment will be paid  in priority  by way of set-off against due claims that Irata holds on the Company in respect of shareholders' loans previously granted  for an aggregate amount of €16 333 740.68 and the balance in cash.In addition  Irata has agreed not to convert the Convertible Bonds prior to June 30  2025 (date on which the triggering threshold for a mandatory tender offering on the Company's shares is raised from 30% to 50% of the shares and/or the voting rights)  provided that in the event of a tender offer on Atari's securities filed by a third party prior to June 30  2025  Irata will have the option to convert its Convertible Bonds prior to such date. As from January 1  2024  Irata also retains the right to convert its Convertible Bonds upon clearance by AMF (décision de conformité) of a tender offer on the Company's securities filed by Irata (or an affiliate).Use of proceedsOn the basis of 100% of the Offering  the gross proceeds from the Offering will amount to approximately 30 million euros and the net proceeds will amount to 29 million euros  it being specified that Irata's subscription to the Offering will be made by way of debt set-off in respect of the repayment of shareholder loans up to its current amount of €16 333 740.68  thus reinforcing the balance sheet of the Company.The balance of the proceeds from the Offering will enable the Company to increase its financial flexibility and general corporate purposes in the context of the development of its transformation strategy:Continued investment in growth initiatives  notably with the on-going development of more than 12 new games that are expected to be launched in the next 18 months; andSeize additional acquisition of opportunities that may arise  including intellectual property rights and direct minority investment in companies offering value-added solutions for the Group.Prior to the Offering  the Company does not have sufficient consolidated net working capital to meet its current obligations for the next (12) months  including the expected contribution of Night Dive Studios. Based on current and planned development projects  notably given the expenses incurred for the ongoing development of new games  the Company will be able to fund its operations until the end of the month of June 2023  without taking into account the proceeds from the Offer. The net amount of additional cash required by the Company to meet its needs over the next 12 months amounts to around 4.5 million euros.Although the Company currently benefits from the continued financial support of its principal shareholder Irata through September 2023  the Offering is the preferred solution for the Company to finance its activity  it being specified that this transaction is subject to the firm and irrevocable Subscription Commitment by Irata covering 100% of the Offering amount. In the event of completion of the Offering  the Company will have sufficient consolidated net working capital to meet its cash requirements over the next twelve (12) months.Date of issue and interestThe Convertible Bonds shall be issued at par and will bear interest from June 5  2023 (the ""Issue Date"") at a rate of 6.50% per annum  payable semi-annually in arrears on July 31 and January 31 of each year (or if such date is not a business day the following business day)  and for the first time on January 31  2024  being 0.00975 euro per Convertible Bond per year.Conversion RightHolders

the seventh business day (included) preceding the Maturity Date  or the relevant early redemption date  as the case may be.The conversion ratio is set at one share per Convertible Bond  subject to

the Company  and shall bear  in any case  current dividend from the date of their delivery and shall be admitted to trading on the Euronext Growth market in Paris (""Euronext Growth"") (ISIN: FR0010478248).Redemption of Convertible BondsUnless previously converted  redeemed or repurchased and cancelled  the Convertible Bonds will be redeemed at par on July 31  2026 (or the following business day if such date is not a business day) (the ""Maturity Date"").The Convertible Bonds may be redeemed prior to the Maturity Date  at the Company's option  and at the holders' option  under certain conditions.In particular  the Convertible Bonds may be redeemed early in full at par plus accrued and unpaid interest at the option of the Company at any time on or after August 21  2025 and until the Maturity Date  subject to at least 30 (but nor more than 60) calendar days' prior notice  if the arithmetic average calculated over a period of 20 consecutive trading days selected by the

their Convertible Bonds prior to the Maturity Date at par plus accrued and unpaid interest.Admission to tradingApplication will be made for the Convertible Bonds to be listed on Euronext Growth before

In this context  the Company has prepared unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information taking into account the Acquisition  a summary of which is presented below on a voluntary basis. The pro forma consolidated financial position of Atari as of September 30  2022 has been prepared to illustrate the impact of the Acquisition and the related financing with retroactive effect to September 30  2022. The pro forma consolidated income statement of the Atari Group for the six-month period ended September 30  2022 has been prepared assuming that the Acquisition and its financing were completed on April 1  2022. The unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information is based on a number of assumptions that Atari believes are reasonable as of the date of this document and in the context of the Acquisition. A detailed post-acquisition analysis may reveal differences in accounting principles that have not been taken into account in the preparation of the pro forma financial information. The pro forma financial information has not been audited by Atari’s statutory auditor and is based  in addition to the corresponding audited consolidated financial statements of Atari  on information prepared by Night Dive for the period ended on September 30  2022.

However  no assurance can be given that an active market for the Convertible Bonds will develop or that Bondholders will be able to sell their Convertible Bonds on such market at satisfactory price and liquidity  in particular given the fact that the main shareholder has undertaken to subscribe to 100% of the of the Convertible Bonds. In addition  if such a market were to develop  it cannot be excluded that the market price of the Convertible Bonds would be subject to significant volatility. If an active market does not develop  the liquidity and price of the Convertible Bonds will be affected. Finally  there is no obligation to make a market in the Convertible Bonds and the Company has not mandated any intermediary to ensure the liquidity of the Convertible Bonds. The Company may not be able to pay the interest or redeem the Convertible Bonds : The Company may not have sufficient financial capacity to pay the interest or redeem the Convertible Bonds. The Company's ability to pay interest and to redeem the Convertible Bonds will depend  among other things  on its financial situation at the time of payment of interest or redemption and may be limited by applicable law  by the terms of its indebtedness and  if applicable  by the terms of any new financing in place at that time that may replace  increase or modify the Company's existing or future debt. The market price of the Company’s shares may fluctuate and fall below the conversion price of the Convertible Bonds : The Company's shares may be traded at a price below the market price prevailing on the date of determination of the conversion price of the Convertible Bonds. The Company cannot provide any assurance that the Company's share market price will not fall below the such price. The Company's cannot provide any assurance that  subsequent to the conversion of the Convertible Bonds  investors will be able to sell their shares at a price at least equal to or greater than such price. The conversion of the Convertible Bonds or the sale of the shares resulting from the conversion of the Convertible Bonds on the market by bondholders is likely to have an adverse impact on the market price of the shares : The conversion of the Convertible Bonds or the sale of the shares resulting from the conversion of the Convertible Bonds by Bondholders is likely to have an adverse impact on the market price of the Company's shares. The Company cannot foresee the possible effects of these events on the market price of the shares. Bondholders have limited anti-dilution protection : The Conversion Ratio applicable in the event of conversion into new shares of the Convertible Bonds will only be adjusted in limited circumstances. Therefore  the Conversion Ratio will not be adjusted in all cases where an event relating to the Company or any other event would be likely to affect the value of the Company's shares or  more generally  to have a dilutive impact. The early redemption of the Convertible Bonds is subject to the approval of the Bondholders' meeting : In the event notably (i) of a breach by the Company of its obligations under the Convertible Bonds  (ii) cross default  (iii) preventive or collective insolvency proceeding or (iv) delisting of the Company's shares  the early redemption of the Convertible Bonds may only be triggered if a majority of the Bondholders have approved the request. Given Irata's subscription commitment and the significant holding of Convertible Bonds that could result  there is no guarantee that a vote in favor of early redemption will be obtained. Risk related to meetings and vote of Noteholders  modification and waivers: Certain provisions permit in certain cases defined majorities to bind all Bondholders including Bondholders who did not attend (or were not represented) and vote at the relevant general meeting  Bondholders who voted in a manner contrary to the majority and Bondholders who did not respond to  or rejected  the relevant resolution. If a decision is adopted by a majority of Bondholders and such modifications were to impair or limit the rights of the Bondholders  this may have a negative impact on the market value of the Convertible Bonds and hence Bondholders may lose part of their investment.Section 4 – Key information on the admission to tradingPoint 4.1 – Under which conditions and timetable can I invest in these securities?Structure of the Offering: the offer of the Convertible Bonds is carried out by way of a public offering  without preferential subscription rights for shareholders with a priority subscription period of four business days  which will enable them to subscribe in priority to the Convertible Bonds (i) on an irreducible basis up to the amount of their share in the share capital of the Company and (ii) on a reducible basis to a number of Convertible Bonds higher than the number to which they can subscribe on an irreducible basis  allocated in proportion to their irreducible applications and  in any event  up to the limit of their demand.Convertible Bonds not subscribed for  on an irreducible or a reducible basis  within the priority subscription period by shareholders will be offered to the public in a public offering in France (the “Public Offering”)  it being specified that Irata commits to subscribe the Offering for the entire Offering during the priority subscription period. The orders received within the Public Offering are therefore likely not to be served. The Offering is made under the 13th and 23rd resolutions adopted by the combined general meeting of the Company's shareholders held on 27 September 2022 (the “Offering”).Priority subscription period: a priority subscription period of four consecutive trading days  from 25 May 2023 to 30 May 2023 (included)  is granted to the shareholders whose shares are registered in their account on 24 May 2023.

On the basis of the closing price of the Company's shares on 23 may 2023  i.e. 0.1304 euros  the subscription price of one Convertible Bond of 0.15 euros represents a premium of 15%.Amount of the offer: the total amount of the offer amounts to 30 million euros  by issue of 200 000 000 Convertible Bonds.Revocation of subscription orders: subscription orders are irrevocable.Notifications to the subscribers of the Convertible Bonds: the subscribers having placed subscription orders on an irreducible basis are assured  subject to the effective completion of the Offering  to receive the number of Convertible Bonds they will have subscribed for within the applicable deadlines. Subscribers who have placed orders to subscribe for the Convertible Bonds on a reducible basis and within the Public Offering will be informed of their allocation by their financial intermediary.Subscription intent of the Company's main shareholders or members of its administrative or management bodies or of any other person intending to subscribe for more than 5%: Irata LLC (the “Irata”)  a 27.73% shareholder of the Company and held by Mr. Wade Rosen  has irrevocably undertaken to subscribe to the Offering (the “Subscription Commitment”) during the priority subscription period of the offering of the Convertible Bonds  on an irreducible basis  up to the amount of its stake in the Company's share capital (i.e. a total number of 55 460 000 Convertible Bonds) and on a reducible basis  up to the balance of the total amount of the Offering not subscribed by it on an irreducible basis  i.e. up to a maximum total amount (including issue premium) of 21 681 000 euros (i.e.  up to 144 450 000 Convertible Bonds). Moreover  in the event that at the end of the subscription period of the Offering  the subscriptions do not represent 100% of the amount of the Offering  Irata has irrevocably and unconditionally undertaken to subscribe for the Convertible Bonds  which will have not been fully paid by the subscribers  allowing for full subscription of this threshold of 100% of the principal amount of this convertible bonds offering  i.e. up to a maximum of 200 000 000 Convertible Bonds for an amount of 30 million euros.The amount of the Subscription Commitment will be paid  in priority  by way of set-off against certain  determined in quantum and due debts that Irata holds on the Company in respect of shareholders' loans previously granted  for an aggregate amount of EUR 16 333 740.68 and the balance in cash. All the debts arising from the Irata loans granted to the Company will be cleared either by this subscription by way of debt set-off  depending on the amount subscribed to Irata  or by the proceeds of the Offering.In addition  Irata has agreed not to convert the Convertible Bonds prior to 30 June 2025 (date on which the triggering threshold for a mandatory public offering on the Company's shares is raised from 30% to 50% of the shares and/or the voting rights)1  provided that in the event of a tender offer on Atari's securities filed by a third party prior to 30 June 2025  Irata will have the option to convert its Convertible Bonds prior to such date. As from 1 January 2024  Irata also retains the right to convert its Convertible Bonds upon clearance by AMF (décision de conformité) of a tender offer on the Company's securities filed by Irata (or an affiliate).Countries in which the offer will be open to the public: the Offering will be open to the public only in France.Restrictions applicable to the offering: the distribution of the Prospectus and the subscription for the Convertible Bonds may  in certain countries  in particular in the United States of America  the United Kingdom  Canada  Australia  Japan or South Africa  be subject to specific regulations.Methods of payment of funds and financial intermediaries:Holders of administered registered shares or bearer shares: subscriptions for the Convertible Bonds and payments of funds by subscribers whose existing shares are held in administered registered form or bearer form will be received by their financial intermediaries holding the accounts until 30 May 2023 inclusive in accordance with the indicative timetable.Pure registered shareholders: subscriptions for the Convertible Bonds and payments of funds by subscribers whose existing shares are held in pure registered form will be received by Uptevia up to and including 30 May 2023 in accordance with the indicative timetable.Payment of the subscription price: each subscription must be accompanied by the payment of the subscription price.

Legal framework of the Offering The Offering is being carried out by way of a public offering in France  except offerings as defined in paragraph 1 of article L.411-2 of the French Monetary and Financial Code  without preferential subscription rights for shareholders with a priority subscription period  in accordance with the 13th and 23rd resolutions adopted by the combined general meeting of shareholders of the Company held on September 27  2022. A priority subscription period of four business days  from May 25  2023 to May 30  2023 (included)  is granted to the shareholders whose shares are registered in their account on May 24  2023  which will enable them to subscribe in priority to the Convertible Bonds (i) on an irreducible basis up to the amount of their share in the share capital of the Company and (ii) on a reducible basis to a number of Convertible Bonds higher than the number to which they can subscribe on an irreducible basis  allocated in proportion to their irreducible applications and  in any event  up to the limit of their demand. This priority period is neither transferable nor negotiable. Convertible Bonds not subscribed for  on an irreducible or reducible basis  within the priority subscription period by shareholders will be offered to the public in the context of a public offering in France  it being specified that the Offering is subject to a subscription commitment by Irata LLC (“Irata”) for the entire amount of the convertible bond offering during the subscription period (the “Subscription Commitment”). Any orders received within the public offering are therefore likely not to be served. The subscription price of the Convertible Bonds under the priority subscription period will be equal to the subscription price of the Convertible Bonds in the public offering and is set at 0.15 euro per share. The subscription price per Convertible Bond shall be equal to the nominal value of each Convertible Bond  to be fully paid up in cash and/or by way of set-off of claims at the time of subscription. On the basis of the closing price of the Company's shares on May 23  2023  i.e. 0.1304 euro  the subscription price of one Convertible Bond of 0.15 euro represents a premium of 15%. Subscription commitment Irata  a 27.73% shareholder of the Company and held by Wade Rosen  chairman and CEO of Atari  has irrevocably undertaken in the Subscription Commitment to subscribe to the Offering during the priority subscription period of the Offering  on an irreducible basis  up to the amount of its stake in the Company's share capital (i.e. a total number of 55 460 000 Convertible Bonds) and on a reducible basis  up to the balance of the total amount of the Offering not subscribed by it on an irreducible basis  i.e. up to a maximum total amount (including conversion premium) of 21 681 000 euros (i.e.  up to 144 540 000 Convertible Bonds). Moreover  in the event that at the end of the subscription period of the Offering  the subscriptions do not represent 100% of the amount of the Offering  Irata has irrevocably and unconditionally undertaken to subscribe for the Convertible Bonds which will have not been fully paid by the subscribers  allowing for full subscription of this threshold of 100% of the principal amount of this convertible bonds offering  i.e. up to a maximum of 200 000 000 Convertible Bonds for an amount of 30 million euros. The amount of the Subscription Commitment will be paid  in priority  by way of set-off against due claims that Irata holds on the Company in respect of shareholders' loans previously granted  for an aggregate amount of €16 333 740.68 and the balance in cash. In addition  Irata has agreed not to convert the Convertible Bonds prior to June 30  2025 (date on which the triggering threshold for a mandatory tender offering on the Company's shares is raised from 30% to 50% of the shares and/or the voting rights)  provided that in the event of a tender offer on Atari's securities filed by a third party prior to June 30  2025  Irata will have the option to convert its Convertible Bonds prior to such date. As from January 1  2024  Irata also retains the right to convert its Convertible Bonds upon clearance by AMF (décision de conformité) of a tender offer on the Company's securities filed by Irata (or an affiliate). Use of proceeds On the basis of 100% of the Offering  the gross proceeds from the Offering will amount to approximately 30 million euros and the net proceeds will amount to 29 million euros  it being specified that Irata's subscription to the Offering will be made by way of debt set-off in respect of the repayment of shareholder loans up to its current amount of €16 333 740.68  thus reinforcing the balance sheet of the Company. The balance of the proceeds from the Offering will enable the Company to increase its financial flexibility and general corporate purposes in the context of the development of its transformation strategy: Continued investment in growth initiatives  notably with the on-going development of more than 12 new games that are expected to be launched in the next 18 months; andSeize additional acquisition of opportunities that may arise  including intellectual property rights and direct minority investment in companies offering value-added solutions for the Group. Prior to the Offering  the Company does not have sufficient consolidated net working capital to meet its current obligations for the next (12) months  including the expected contribution of Night Dive Studios. Based on current and planned development projects  notably given the expenses incurred for the ongoing development of new games  the Company will be able to fund its operations until the end of the month of June 2023  without taking into account the proceeds from the Offer. The net amount of additional cash required by the Company to meet its needs over the next 12 months amounts to around 4.5 million euros. Although the Company currently benefits from the continued financial support of its principal shareholder Irata through September 2023  the Offering is the preferred solution for the Company to finance its activity  it being specified that this transaction is subject to the firm and irrevocable Subscription Commitment by Irata covering 100% of the Offering amount. In the event of completion of the Offering  the Company will have sufficient consolidated net working capital to meet its cash requirements over the next twelve (12) months.

However  no assurance can be given that an active market for the Convertible Bonds will develop or that Bondholders will be able to sell their Convertible Bonds on such market at satisfactory price and liquidity  in particular given the fact that the main shareholder has undertaken to subscribe to 100% of the of the Convertible Bonds. In addition  if such a market were to develop  it cannot be excluded that the market price of the Convertible Bonds would be subject to significant volatility. If an active market does not develop  the liquidity and price of the Convertible Bonds will be affected. Finally  there is no obligation to make a market in the Convertible Bonds and the Company has not mandated any intermediary to ensure the liquidity of the Convertible Bonds. The Company may not be able to pay the interest or redeem the Convertible Bonds : The Company may not have sufficient financial capacity to pay the interest or redeem the Convertible Bonds. The Company's ability to pay interest and to redeem the Convertible Bonds will depend  among other things  on its financial situation at the time of payment of interest or redemption and may be limited by applicable law  by the terms of its indebtedness and  if applicable  by the terms of any new financing in place at that time that may replace  increase or modify the Company's existing or future debt. The market price of the Company’s shares may fluctuate and fall below the conversion price of the Convertible Bonds : The Company's shares may be traded at a price below the market price prevailing on the date of determination of the conversion price of the Convertible Bonds. The Company cannot provide any assurance that the Company's share market price will not fall below the such price. The Company's cannot provide any assurance that  subsequent to the conversion of the Convertible Bonds  investors will be able to sell their shares at a price at least equal to or greater than such price. The conversion of the Convertible Bonds or the sale of the shares resulting from the conversion of the Convertible Bonds on the market by bondholders is likely to have an adverse impact on the market price of the shares : The conversion of the Convertible Bonds or the sale of the shares resulting from the conversion of the Convertible Bonds by Bondholders is likely to have an adverse impact on the market price of the Company's shares. The Company cannot foresee the possible effects of these events on the market price of the shares. Bondholders have limited anti-dilution protection : The Conversion Ratio applicable in the event of conversion into new shares of the Convertible Bonds will only be adjusted in limited circumstances. Therefore  the Conversion Ratio will not be adjusted in all cases where an event relating to the Company or any other event would be likely to affect the value of the Company's shares or  more generally  to have a dilutive impact. The early redemption of the Convertible Bonds is subject to the approval of the Bondholders' meeting : In the event notably (i) of a breach by the Company of its obligations under the Convertible Bonds  (ii) cross default  (iii) preventive or collective insolvency proceeding or (iv) delisting of the Company's shares  the early redemption of the Convertible Bonds may only be triggered if a majority of the Bondholders have approved the request. Given Irata's subscription commitment and the significant holding of Convertible Bonds that could result  there is no guarantee that a vote in favor of early redemption will be obtained. Risk related to meetings and vote of Noteholders  modification and waivers: Certain provisions permit in certain cases defined majorities to bind all Bondholders including Bondholders who did not attend (or were not represented) and vote at the relevant general meeting  Bondholders who voted in a manner contrary to the majority and Bondholders who did not respond to  or rejected  the relevant resolution. If a decision is adopted by a majority of Bondholders and such modifications were to impair or limit the rights of the Bondholders  this may have a negative impact on the market value of the Convertible Bonds and hence Bondholders may lose part of their investment. Section 4 – Key information on the admission to tradingPoint 4.1 – Under which conditions and timetable can I invest in these securities? Structure of the Offering: the offer of the Convertible Bonds is carried out by way of a public offering  without preferential subscription rights for shareholders with a priority subscription period of four business days  which will enable them to subscribe in priority to the Convertible Bonds (i) on an irreducible basis up to the amount of their share in the share capital of the Company and (ii) on a reducible basis to a number of Convertible Bonds higher than the number to which they can subscribe on an irreducible basis  allocated in proportion to their irreducible applications and  in any event  up to the limit of their demand.Convertible Bonds not subscribed for  on an irreducible or a reducible basis  within the priority subscription period by shareholders will be offered to the public in a public offering in France (the “Public Offering”)  it being specified that Irata commits to subscribe the Offering for the entire Offering during the priority subscription period. The orders received within the Public Offering are therefore likely not to be served. The Offering is made under the 13th and 23rd resolutions adopted by the combined general meeting of the Company's shareholders held on 27 September 2022 (the “Offering”).Priority subscription period: a priority subscription period of four consecutive trading days  from 25 May 2023 to 30 May 2023 (included)  is granted to the shareholders whose shares are registered in their account on 24 May 2023. This priority subscription period is neither transferable nor negotiable.Subscription price of the Convertible Bonds: 0.15 euro per Convertible Bond  equal to the nominal value of each Convertible Bond  to be fully paid up by payment in cash (in cash and / or by debt setoff) at the time of subscription. On the basis of the closing price of the Company's shares on 23 may 2023  i.e. 0.1304 euros  the subscription price of one Convertible Bond of 0.15 euros represents a premium of 15%.Amount of the offer: the total amount of the offer amounts to 30 million euros  by issue of 200 000 000 Convertible Bonds.Revocation of subscription orders: subscription orders are irrevocable.Notifications to the subscribers of the Convertible Bonds: the subscribers having placed subscription orders on an irreducible basis are assured  subject to the effective completion of the Offering  to receive the number of Convertible Bonds they will have subscribed for within the applicable deadlines. Subscribers who have placed orders to subscribe for the Convertible Bonds on a reducible basis and within the Public Offering will be informed of their allocation by their financial intermediary.Subscription intent of the Company's main shareholders or members of its administrative or management bodies or of any other person intending to subscribe for more than 5%: Irata LLC (the “Irata”)  a 27.73% shareholder of the Company and held by Mr. Wade Rosen  has irrevocably undertaken to subscribe to the Offering (the “Subscription Commitment”) during the priority subscription period of the offering of the Convertible Bonds  on an irreducible basis  up to the amount of its stake in the Company's share capital (i.e. a total number of 55 460 000 Convertible Bonds) and on a reducible basis  up to the balance of the total amount of the Offering not subscribed by it on an irreducible basis  i.e. up to a maximum total amount (including issue premium) of 21 681 000 euros (i.e.  up to 144 450 000 Convertible Bonds). Moreover  in the event that at the end of the subscription period of the Offering  the subscriptions do not represent 100% of the amount of the Offering  Irata has irrevocably and unconditionally undertaken to subscribe for the Convertible Bonds  which will have not been fully paid by the subscribers  allowing for full subscription of this threshold of 100% of the principal amount of this convertible bonds offering  i.e. up to a maximum of 200 000 000 Convertible Bonds for an amount of 30 million euros.The amount of the Subscription Commitment will be paid  in priority  by way of set-off against certain  determined in quantum and due debts that Irata holds on the Company in respect of shareholders' loans previously granted  for an aggregate amount of EUR 16 333 740.68 and the balance in cash. All the debts arising from the Irata loans granted to the Company will be cleared either by this subscription by way of debt set-off  depending on the amount subscribed to Irata  or by the proceeds of the Offering.In addition  Irata has agreed not to convert the Convertible Bonds prior to 30 June 2025 (date on which the triggering threshold for a mandatory public offering on the Company's shares is raised from 30% to 50% of the shares and/or the voting rights)1  provided that in the event of a tender offer on Atari's securities filed by a third party prior to 30 June 2025  Irata will have the option to convert its Convertible Bonds prior to such date.

Given the high level of interest from both investigators and patients  additional patients are still likely to be included in the trial  which would mean the trial will be over-enrolled.As it has now reached its enrollment target  Oxurion confirms its previous guidance that it anticipates reporting top-line data from the KALAHARI trial in the fourth quarter of 2023.“We are thrilled to reach our enrollment target in the KALAHARI trial  and the fact that we are likely to over-enroll is further testament to both the need for this therapy as well as the continued support of our investigators worldwide ” said Andy De Deene  MD  MBA  Chief Development Officer of Oxurion. “The outcome of this trial  which is evaluating THR-149 for the treatment of DME against the current standard of care  aflibercept  could  if positive  provide an important alternative for the up to 50% of patients with DME who respond suboptimally to current anti-VEGF therapies.”Added Tom Graney  CFA  CEO of Oxurion  said  “Attaining this milestone is an important catalyst for Oxurion as we move towards completion of the KALAHARI trial. With the enrollment target reached  the study is well-positioned to report top-line results by the end of the year. If positive  these results could provide a meaningfully better alternative for the millions of patients worldwide suffering from DME for whom current treatments are not effective. I would like to thank the investigators  their teams  our amazing team  and most of all the patients  for progressing this important trial on behalf of the broader retinal community.”The KALAHARI trial is evaluating Oxurion’s novel plasma kallikrein (PKal) inhibitor THR-149 as a potential treatment for DME patients who respond suboptimally to anti-VEGF therapy  the current standard of care. This milestone follows the recommendation from an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) in December 2022 that the KALAHARI trial should continue based on the outcome of a pre-specified futility analysis that included an evaluation of interim efficacy and safety data from 31 patients at the three-month time point.Diabetic Macular Edema (DME)Approximately 22 million people worldwide have DME currently  with prevalence increasing due to the growing global diabetic epidemic. DME is the leading cause of vision loss in working-age people  and the market for treatments is currently estimated at +$5 billion.People who suffer from DME have leaking vessels in the back of the eye  leading to a thickening of the retina that causes vision problems such as blurriness in the center of vision  the appearance of dark spots or patches in the field of vision  and colors to look dull. These symptoms may affect the ability to read  write  drive  and recognize faces – presenting a significant patient and caregiver burden.About THR-149THR-149 is a bicyclic peptide that selectively inhibits human plasma kallikrein (PKal) with an inhibition constant of 0.22 nM. Through the inhibition of the kallikrein-kinin system (KKS)  THR-149 prevents the induction of retinal vascular permeability  neurodegeneration  and inflammation. THR-149 is currently being evaluated in the KALAHARI Phase 2  Part B clinical trial as a potential treatment for patients who respond suboptimally to anti-VEGF the standard of care for treatment of DME.KALAHARI Phase 2  Part BThe Phase 2 KALAHARI trial is a two-part  randomized  prospective  multi-center trial assessing multiple (3) injections of THR-149 in DME patients. Part B is double-masked and actively controlled  with the high dose of THR-149 having been selected from Part A of the trial. Part B of the trial is enrolling approximately 108 patients who have previously shown a suboptimal response to anti-VEGF therapy  and where THR-149 is being evaluated against aflibercept  the current standard of care  as the active comparator.KALAHARI Phase 2  Part APart A of the KALAHARI trial demonstrated that all dose levels of THR-149 had a favorable safety profile. All adverse events in the study eye were mild to moderate in intensity and no severe ocular adverse events were reported and no inflammation was observed. High-level data from Part A of the KALAHARI trial was first presented in October 2021  which demonstrated that the eight patients who received the highest dose of THR-149 achieved a mean BCVA gain of 6.1 letters at Month 3  the primary endpoint.A post-hoc analysis was performed by the masked central reading center in February 2022 based on an OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography) biomarker assessment. The analysis identified two subjects with abnormalities at baseline  which could impact responsiveness to any medical treatment. Excluding these two subjects resulted in an improvement in mean BCVA of 9.3 letters at Month 3  which was sustained until Month 6  the end of the trial  and four months after the last THR-149 injection. The Month 6 data also demonstrated THR-149’s attractive safety profile and its ability to stabilize the Central Subfield Thickness (CST). The learnings from the Part A data were incorporated into Part B through an amended trial design excluding patients that would not respond to any treatment.

Al…,"Resolution 24  being the ordinary resolution to approve the waiver by the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers under Rule 9 of the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers (the ""Rule 9 waiver"") in connection with the Company's buyback programme was duly passed by 78.07% of the votes cast by the independent shareholders of the Company (being shareholders other than Olive and its presumed concert parties) with 21.93% of votes against. Resolution 24 is a standing agenda item at each Annual General Meeting to enable CCEP to exercise the authorities under Resolution 28 to purchase its own shares on market and Resolution 29 to purchase its own shares off market  which were passed with majorities of 99.78% and 98.42% respectively. This will enable CCEP to make use of the option to return value to shareholders through a possible future buyback programme. Had Resolution 24 not been passed  the Company would not have been able to effect such buyback programmes  as explained in the Notice of AGM and also in the Letter to Shareholders issued via RNS on 15 May 2023. CCEP intends to continue to engage with ISS on their standing policy to recommend a vote against a Rule 9 waiver which we believe may be influencing investor decisions in this regard. In addition  CCEP will continue to engage  in normal course and as appropriate  with shareholders who did not support Resolution 24 to understand the reasons for their vote against the proposal and to continue a transparent and constructive dialogue on this topic.Olive is currently interested in 166 128 987 shares in the Company and the Waiver does not entitle Olive to be interested in a greater number of shares. The Waiver would allow Olive's interest in shares as a percentage of the Company's total shares to increase as a result of the exercise of the Company's authorities to purchase its own shares  but only to the extent that the resulting interest of Olive  together with any concert parties  in the shares of the Company did not then exceed 40.2797%.In accordance with Listing Rule 14.3.6R  copies of the resolutions that do not constitute ordinary business at an annual general meeting will be submitted to the National Storage Mechanism and will shortly be available for inspection at https://data.fca.org.uk/#/nsm/nationalstoragemechanism.CONTACTS Company Secretariat Investor Relations Media Relations Clare Wardle Sarah Willett Shanna Wendt T +44 (0)20 7355 8406 T +44 (0)7970 145 218 T +44 (0)7976 595 168ABOUT CCEPCoca-Cola Europacific Partners is one of the world's leading consumer goods companies.

I was made fully aware of the Company’s recent challenges and the many justified concerns of our shareholders. I accepted the role because my analysis revealed strong fundamentals and tremendous potential to create significant value for Mithra shareholders. Because of our current situation  I want to be transparent with regards to our strategy in this critical period and address the most important questions of our shareholders. I will lay out in this letter our most important priorities for the coming year as we work to build solid new foundations for Mithra’s future growth.Three key positive points stood out in my assessment of Mithra: first  our research and development organization’s accomplishments show that it is one of the best in the industry; second  Estelle® and Donesta® are not yet fairly valued as highly differentiated innovative therapeutics for women’s health; and  third  our underexploited contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO)  holds value that can be unlocked. Given the disappointments the Company has had  and the outsized impact these events have had on our valuation  I am working intensively with Mithra leadership to effect change expeditiously so that the Company can once again be recognized for its achievements and fundamental value.In order to do this we have three short-term corporate priorities: first  we must provide the financial resources that the Company needs; second  we are in advanced discussions to close a licensing deal for U.S. marketing rights for Donesta®; third  we are actively exploring potential options that would allow us to maximize the value of our CDMO facility and regain sharper focus on the core business.While our generics business also holds value and could serve to diversify our portfolio of products in the long-run  it is a low margin business that can act as a brake on growth while also taking our focus from our core strength - development of best-in-class innovative novel therapeutics. We will look to re-focus on the areas where we can compete most effectively  and this may mean that we could sell or explore other strategic options for our generic products business.I am eager to leverage my 30 years of experience in strategic  operational  and innovation-focused leadership to catalyse the exceptional team at Mithra as we work in lockstep to generate shareholder value. In addition  we aim at adding experienced executives with complementary competencies to our senior management and our board of directors over the course of the coming year. My track record has been built on successful product development delivery and high value strategic partnerships  best exemplified by the achievements of Zealand Pharma and Silence Therapeutics. In each of these cases  we have established U.S. operations to pursue our interests in the most important commercial market  and I intend to do the same for Mithra.As a top priority  I have been working closely with our CFO to secure Mithra’s finances in order to empower the Company to pursue our new strategy. I am pleased that after only one month in my role  we are announcing today that we have taken a critical first step by obtaining commitments for EUR 2.5 million in new equity and access to EUR 12.5 million in new funds from drawing under Tranche C while simultaneously improving some of the financial terms of our convertible loan facility from funds managed by Highbridge Capital Management LLC (""Highbridge"") and funds managed by Whitebox Advisors LLC (""Whitebox"")  who have indicated to me their strong support for Mithra and our new strategy.While it is an important positive step that enables us to pursue other pressing corporate activities with greater confidence  further step-wise improvements to our financial health are key. We are therefore working to affect a full refinancing of our debt obligations during the second half of this year. In addition to acquiring the requisite financial resources  we want to align shareholder interests such that future increases in our product revenues will benefit all shareholders and motivate new ones to join us  so as to deliver on value creation for patients as well as shareholders.Collectively  the Mithra leadership understands that our ability to create value for our shareholders is a primary directive that goes hand in hand with developing medicines for women. While most of our attention is focused on immediate priorities  such as the company’s finances  negotiating favorable terms for Donesta with a U.S. marketing partner  and exploring strategic options for our CDMO  I am also looking forward and planning for Mithra’s growth.In the medium term  we will look to maximize sales of Estelle® and Donesta® by continuing to develop them in new indications and also conducting studies to produce data (in support of our partners’ marketing efforts) demonstrating their unique points of differentiation compared to other products on the market. Longer term  we will look to continue to source and develop new products for women’s health  potentially through in-licensing or acquisitions.Our ambition is to become a global leader in women’s health. Therefore  Mithra will work to replenish its pipeline through organic growth as well as partnering. We will work with international investors and stakeholders to introduce our ambition and rebuild our business and are establishing a US representation office.Financial UpdateToday we announced that we have successfully reached an agreement to update the terms of our loan facility agreement with Highbridge and Whitebox  a first step to put Mithra back on secure financial footing.Following successful negotiation with key debt providers  Highbridge and Whitebox  Mithra will receive access to EUR 12.5 million of Tranche C. Furthermore  existing convertible loans that had a floating conversion price have been successfully renegotiated to new fix conversion price of EUR 2.75 (a premium of 25% over the price for the new equity round to be subscribed for by Highbridge and Whitebox  subject to customary anti-dilution and takeover protections). The loan interest coupon will be adjusted in line with current market conditions from 7.5% to 8.0% for Tranche A and B  and 9% for newly drawn Tranche C. Access to EUR 12.5 million of Tranche C and the other amendments to the convertible loan facility with Highbridge and Whitebox are subject to conditions and subject to finalizing additional contractual agreements. In an effort to further minimize equity dilution going forward  the Company intends no longer to make drawings under the GSI facility. As an evidence of strong support for Mithra’s long-term growth  Highbridge and Whitebox have elected to subscribe for EUR 2.5 million of new shares to be issued by the Company at an issue price of EUR 2.20  a 14% discount to the arithmetic mean of the five trailing daily VWAPs  a favourable market rate. The capital increase is expected to be completed later today.At the end of April  Mithra’s unaudited cash position was about EUR 26 million on a proforma basis. At the same time  our projected 2023 research and development spend is approximately EUR 60 million. It goes without saying that the cash level must be taken into account during negotiations; now  thanks to this new capital  as well as access to additional cash via the amended loan facility  I believe we can leverage our improved financial strength with confidence to negotiate U.S. marketing rights to Donesta®as well consider options for our CDMO facility. Furthermore  we can also work in good faith to achieve another mutually acceptable amendment: one that will align the Uteron Sellers with Mithra’s long-term growth and success.Considering our current financial status  the amendment demonstrates Highbridge and Whitebox are strongly supportive of our strategy and committed to support Mithra’s long-term growth.Estelle®Our first marketed product Estelle® composed of 15 mg Estetrol (E4) and 3 mg Drospirenone (DRSP)  is the first and only contraceptive pill containing Estetrol  a native estrogen. Estetrol shows a specific mode of action compared to other estrogens. Estetrol has also a beneficial impact on the cardiovascular system  brain  bone and endometrium; unlike other estrogens  it has a limited impact on the liver and breast tissue. This unique mode of action results in an improved benefit/risk profile compared to other estrogens.Because of its unique mode of action and safety profile  we believe Estetrol represents a major breakthrough in women’s health starting with contraception and potentially for menopause. While it is only just beginning to generate significant value for shareholders  we believe that our marketing partners in U.S. and Europe (Mayne Pharma and Gedeon Richter  respectively)  will be able to further optimize commercial exploitation of these assets.Estelle®was recently commercialized in the US  Canada and Europe. It is the first new estrogen introduced in the US in more than 50 years.Donesta®A US licensing deal for Donesta® (estetrol-based hormone therapy)  should provide a significant short-term upfront cash payment and long-term revenues from milestones and royalties on sales for Mithra. I believe this is the most important short and medium-term source of revenue for the Company and am working  together with our team  to establish a deal that properly reflects the potential value generated by Mithra’s exceptional research and development team.The symptoms of menopause represent a significant unmet need that is increasingly recognized as requiring treatment by the medical profession and incidence of menopause is growing with our aging population. While symptoms such as hot flashes  night sweats  mood changes  sleep disturbances  joint aches and cognitive difficulties damage the quality of life for millions of women  the adverse effect on women has recently had an estimated societal cost assigned to it  further justifying therapeutic intervention. A newly published Mayo Clinic study estimated $1.8 billion in lost work time per year and $26.6 billion annually when medical expenses are added  in the US alone. Furthermore  data suggest that proper management during pre-menopause and menopause can reduce incidence of dementia and other long-term causes of mortality. Donesta® can play an important role in improving not only women’s quality and quantity of life but also reduce medical costs and improve productivity.We have a pre-NDA meeting with the FDA in the near term to support the filing of our new drug application (NDA) for Donesta®  which has been slightly delayed; we now plan to file it in H2 2023 instead of H1 2023 due to regulatory enquiries  as previously communicated. The expected timing of the marketing authorization for the US remains unchanged at the moment. In Europe  where Donesta® was recently licensed (in key territories) to Gedeon  we are reiterating our guidance on filing and working closely with our partner to support the marketing authorization (MAA) filing  planned for 2024.CDMOExecuting on a strategy to unlock the value of our world-class CDMO facility in Flémalle  is critical to returning the Company to financial health. This state-of-art building holds tremendous capacity and untold potential. In light of the new Company strategies  an in-house manufacturing and development facility is not a strategic asset for the Company  and therefore is currently underutilized  offering untapped potential. Considering strategic options is helping us to realize the full value of the CDMO and leveraging the team’s expertise and versatile capabilities.Europe  and much of the rest of the developed world  is struggling to maintain secure  sustainable drug supplies  with ongoing and varied challenges in supply chains. As such  we are exploring potential strategic solutions for the CDMO that may ultimately benefit multiple parties  including the Flémalle region  Mithra employees and shareholders.Revenue projectionOur product sales are still ramping up but I can share that we are currently projecting total product revenues for Estelle® of about EUR 12 million in 2023 to more than double in 2024 and again in 2025 as they grow to up to approximately EUR 130 million by 2029.Mithra could be cash flow positive in 2026 or  counting possible milestone revenues  potentially even 2025. We currently expect Mithra’s combined revenues from global sales of Estelle®  Donesta® and MyRing® to grow to approximately EUR 300 million by 2029.ConclusionIn conclusion  I believe my priorities as CEO are clear: secure the Company’s finances; secure a U.S. marketing partner for Donesta®; find the best solution for our CDMO; maximize product revenues and  finally  empower our accomplished R&D organization to identify and bring to market new and exciting products for women’s health.To achieve these goals  we must restore Mithra’s financial health  execute on impactful partnerships and focus our internal team’s efforts on delivering the best value from our existing and future pipeline of innovative products  especially Donesta®. Simply put  Mithra can and will navigate through the current situation and ultimately deliver on its promise of becoming a global leader in women’s health.I wish to thank you  our shareholders  for your support during this difficult transition period in the Company’s history  especially in light of the troubling geopolitical and volatile market conditions. I believe communication is an essential part of any successful relationship  especially during difficult periods. I look forward to continuing with increased transparency and regular communications to providing updates on our progress to you  our shareholders.With best regards David Horn SolomonChief Executive OfficerFor more information  please contact:Mithra Pharmaceuticals SADavid Horn SolomonChief Executive Officerinvestorrelations@mithra.com Investor & media relationsChris MaggosCohesion Bureauchris.maggos@cohesionbureau.com+41 79 367 6254For analysts  please contact: Alexandra Deschner (investorrelations@mithra.com) or (adeschner@mithra.com)About MithraMithra (Euronext: MITRA) is a Belgian biotech company dedicated to transforming Women’s Health by offering new choices through innovation  with a particular focus on contraception and menopause.

Lyten  a pioneer of three- dimensional (3D) Graphene  will leverage the unique tunability of the material to enable enhanced vehicle performance and customer experience while decarbonizing the transportation sector.Lyten’s tunable materials platform has demonstrated significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and will advance the transition to sustainable mobility.Unlike traditional lithium-ion batteries  Lyten’s Lithium-Sulfur batteries do not use nickel  cobalt  or manganese  resulting in an estimated 60% lower carbon footprint than today’s best-in-class batteries and a pathway to achieve the lowest emissions EV battery on the global market. Raw materials for Lithium-Sulfur batteries have the potential to be sourced and produced locally  in North America or Europe  enhancing regional supply sovereignty. This technology will meet the needs of industries seeking lightweight and energy-dense batteries that are free from supply chain disruptions.Stellantis launched Stellantis Ventures in 2022 as a venture capital fund committed to investing in early and later-stage startup companies developing innovative and sustainable technologies within the automotive and mobility sectors. Stellantis Ventures  powered by an initial €300 million in funding  is a key component of the Company’s Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan  which sets out core targets for Stellantis  including deep emission cuts to slash CO 2 in half by 2030  benchmarking the 2021 metrics  and achieving carbon net zero by 2038 with single-digit percentage compensation of the remaining emissions.“We are delighted that Stellantis Ventures  as the venture investment arm of a global automotive innovator  has demonstrated a strong belief in our company and our Lyten 3D Graphene™ decarbonizing supermaterials ” said Dan Cook  president and CEO of Lyten. “Among the automotive product innovations being transformed by Lyten 3D Graphene™ are Lithium-Sulfur batteries with the potential to deliver more than twice the energy density of lithium-ion  payload-improving lightweighted vehicle composites  and new modes of sensing that do not require chips  batteries or wires. We are committed to advancing each of these applications to Stellantis and the automotive market.”Cook continued: “Unlike two-dimensional forms of graphene  the production of our tunable Lyten 3D Graphene™ has been independently verified to be carbon neutral at scale. We are converting greenhouse gases into a new class of high-performance  high-value carbon materials and are incorporating these tuned materials into applications that will decarbonize the hardest to abate sectors on the planet.”“Having recently visited Lyten together with our CTO Ned Curic and our head of Stellantis Ventures  Adam Bazih  we walked away impressed by the potential of this technology to help drive clean  safe and affordable mobility ” said Carlos Tavares  Stellantis CEO. “Lyten’s materials platform is a key investment for Stellantis Ventures  in line with our Dare Forward 2030 goal to accelerate deployment of innovative  customer-centric technologies. Specifically  Lyten’s Lithium-Sulfur battery has the potential to be a key ingredient in enabling mass-market EV adoption globally  and their material technology is equally well positioned to help reduce vehicle weight  which is all necessary for our industry to achieve carbon net zero goals.”With traditional lithium-ion battery materials in critically short supply for EV manufacturing  Lyten’s Lithium-Sulfur battery will offer an alternative  non-nickel-manganese-cobalt cathode solution that supports the global transition to electric vehicles at mass market scale. Lyten’s goal is to provide a secure supply of performance-based and environmentally sustainable products to its customers  while also enabling auto manufacturers to take advantage of growing U.S. and European policy incentives  such as those referenced in the Inflation Reduction Act.Lyten’s Lithium-Sulfur battery  composites  and sensor technologies are initially being produced on its 145 000 square foot campus in Silicon Valley. Apart from producing EV batteries  Lyten is working with previous customers to start delivering Lithium-Sulfur batteries and 3D Graphene-infused composites for specialty markets in 2023. Lyten is collaborating with its strategic investors from across multiple industries to apply Lyten 3D Graphene materials to decarbonize additional  carbon intensive sectors beyond transportation  with more announcements planned for later this year.# # #About Lyten 3D Graphene™Lyten 3D Graphene™ is a proprietary  tunable decarbonization supermaterial engineered from natural gas. Lyten’s 3D Graphene is similar to two-dimensional graphene in many of its valuable properties  however  3D Graphene can be orders of magnitude more chemically and electrically reactive while also being highly tunable due to its three-dimensional morphology. The processes and equipment to engineer three-dimensional graphene materials are proprietary technological inventions patented by Lyten. Lyten will scale its initial output from its San Jose  California facility and will soon explore locations for a second phase of output capacity.About LytCell EV™ Lithium-Sulfur batteryLytCell™ is Lyten’s proprietary Lithium-Sulfur battery that uses Lyten 3D Graphene™ to address the polysulfide shuttle challenges associated with sulfur  leading to a higher-performance battery that will have more than twice the energy density  and enables extended driving range compared to conventional EV batteries. Unlike lithium-ion and solid-state batteries  LytCell™ does not use expensive and scarce nickel or cobalt  will have an estimated 60+ percent lower carbon footprint than best-in-class lithium-ion  and an estimated 40 percent lower carbon footprint than solid state. The LytCell will be domestically and sustainably sourced  liberating manufacturers and consumers from supply chain risks and environmentally unsound mining issues associated with nickel-manganese-cobalt oxide (NMC) materials.About LytR™LytR™ is Lyten’s unique thermoplastic formulation – infused with Lyten 3D Graphene™ – that reduces up to half the weight and materials required while maintaining or improving strength and performance. When Lyten 3D Graphene™ is tuned for dispersion into polyethylene  as with the LytR™ material  it significantly strengthens the thermoplastics’ chemical and physical properties  thereby requiring less polyethylene material and reducing the carbon footprint by up to 55%.About LytenLyten is a materials innovation and applications company and the pioneer of the Lyten 3D Graphene™ materials platform.

I was made fully aware of the Company’s recent challenges and the many justified concerns of our shareholders. I accepted the role because my analysis revealed strong fundamentals and tremendous potential to create significant value for Mithra shareholders. Because of our current situation  I want to be transparent with regards to our strategy in this critical period and address the most important questions of our shareholders. I will lay out in this letter our most important priorities for the coming year as we work to build solid new foundations for Mithra’s future growth.Three key positive points stood out in my assessment of Mithra: first  our research and development organization’s accomplishments show that it is one of the best in the industry; second  Estelle® and Donesta® are not yet fairly valued as highly differentiated innovative therapeutics for women’s health; and  third  our underexploited contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO)  holds value that can be unlocked. Given the disappointments the Company has had  and the outsized impact these events have had on our valuation  I am working intensively with Mithra leadership to effect change expeditiously so that the Company can once again be recognized for its achievements and fundamental value.In order to do this we have three short-term corporate priorities: first  we must provide the financial resources that the Company needs; second  we are in advanced discussions to close a licensing deal for U.S. marketing rights for Donesta®; third  we are actively exploring potential options that would allow us to maximize the value of our CDMO facility and regain sharper focus on the core business.While our generics business also holds value and could serve to diversify our portfolio of products in the long-run  it is a low margin business that can act as a brake on growth while also taking our focus from our core strength - development of best-in-class innovative novel therapeutics. We will look to re-focus on the areas where we can compete most effectively  and this may mean that we could sell or explore other strategic options for our generic products business.I am eager to leverage my 30 years of experience in strategic  operational  and innovation-focused leadership to catalyse the exceptional team at Mithra as we work in lockstep to generate shareholder value. In addition  we aim at adding experienced executives with complementary competencies to our senior management and our board of directors over the course of the coming year. My track record has been built on successful product development delivery and high value strategic partnerships  best exemplified by the achievements of Zealand Pharma and Silence Therapeutics. In each of these cases  we have established U.S. operations to pursue our interests in the most important commercial market  and I intend to do the same for Mithra.As a top priority  I have been working closely with our CFO to secure Mithra’s finances in order to empower the Company to pursue our new strategy. I am pleased that after only one month in my role  we are announcing today that we have taken a critical first step by obtaining commitments for EUR 2.5 million in new equity and access to EUR 12.5 million in new funds from drawing under Tranche C while simultaneously improving some of the financial terms of our convertible loan facility from funds managed by Highbridge Capital Management LLC (""Highbridge"") and funds managed by Whitebox Advisors LLC (""Whitebox"")  who have indicated to me their strong support for Mithra and our new strategy.While it is an important positive step that enables us to pursue other pressing corporate activities with greater confidence  further step-wise improvements to our financial health are key. We are therefore working to affect a full refinancing of our debt obligations during the second half of this year. In addition to acquiring the requisite financial resources  we want to align shareholder interests such that future increases in our product revenues will benefit all shareholders and motivate new ones to join us  so as to deliver on value creation for patients as well as shareholders.Collectively  the Mithra leadership understands that our ability to create value for our shareholders is a primary directive that goes hand in hand with developing medicines for women. While most of our attention is focused on immediate priorities  such as the company’s finances  negotiating favorable terms for Donesta with a U.S. marketing partner  and exploring strategic options for our CDMO  I am also looking forward and planning for Mithra’s growth.In the medium term  we will look to maximize sales of Estelle® and Donesta® by continuing to develop them in new indications and also conducting studies to produce data (in support of our partners’ marketing efforts) demonstrating their unique points of differentiation compared to other products on the market. Longer term  we will look to continue to source and develop new products for women’s health  potentially through in-licensing or acquisitions.Our ambition is to become a global leader in women’s health. Therefore  Mithra will work to replenish its pipeline through organic growth as well as partnering. We will work with international investors and stakeholders to introduce our ambition and rebuild our business and are establishing a US representation office.Financial UpdateToday we announced that we have successfully reached an agreement to update the terms of our loan facility agreement with Highbridge and Whitebox  a first step to put Mithra back on secure financial footing.Following successful negotiation with key debt providers  Highbridge and Whitebox  Mithra will receive access to EUR 12.5 million of Tranche C. Furthermore  existing convertible loans that had a floating conversion price have been successfully renegotiated to new fix conversion price of EUR 2.75 (a premium of 25% over the price for the new equity round to be subscribed for by Highbridge and Whitebox  subject to customary anti-dilution and takeover protections). The loan interest coupon will be adjusted in line with current market conditions from 7.5% to 8.0% for Tranche A and B  and 9% for newly drawn Tranche C. Access to EUR 12.5 million of Tranche C and the other amendments to the convertible loan facility with Highbridge and Whitebox are subject to conditions and subject to finalizing additional contractual agreements. In an effort to further minimize equity dilution going forward  the Company intends no longer to make drawings under the GSI facility. As an evidence of strong support for Mithra’s long-term growth  Highbridge and Whitebox have elected to subscribe for EUR 2.5 million of new shares to be issued by the Company at an issue price of EUR 2.20  a 14% discount to the arithmetic mean of the five trailing daily VWAPs  a favourable market rate. The capital increase is expected to be completed later today.At the end of April  Mithra’s unaudited cash position was about EUR 26 million on a proforma basis. At the same time  our projected 2023 research and development spend is approximately EUR 60 million. It goes without saying that the cash level must be taken into account during negotiations; now  thanks to this new capital  as well as access to additional cash via the amended loan facility  I believe we can leverage our improved financial strength with confidence to negotiate U.S. marketing rights to Donesta®as well consider options for our CDMO facility. Furthermore  we can also work in good faith to achieve another mutually acceptable amendment: one that will align the Uteron Sellers with Mithra’s long-term growth and success.Considering our current financial status  the amendment demonstrates Highbridge and Whitebox are strongly supportive of our strategy and committed to support Mithra’s long-term growth.Estelle®Our first marketed product Estelle® composed of 15 mg Estetrol (E4) and 3 mg Drospirenone (DRSP)  is the first and only contraceptive pill containing Estetrol  a native estrogen. Estetrol shows a specific mode of action compared to other estrogens. Estetrol has also a beneficial impact on the cardiovascular system  brain  bone and endometrium; unlike other estrogens  it has a limited impact on the liver and breast tissue. This unique mode of action results in an improved benefit/risk profile compared to other estrogens.Because of its unique mode of action and safety profile  we believe Estetrol represents a major breakthrough in women’s health starting with contraception and potentially for menopause. While it is only just beginning to generate significant value for shareholders  we believe that our marketing partners in U.S. and Europe (Mayne Pharma and Gedeon Richter  respectively)  will be able to further optimize commercial exploitation of these assets.Estelle®was recently commercialized in the US  Canada and Europe. It is the first new estrogen introduced in the US in more than 50 years.Donesta®A US licensing deal for Donesta® (estetrol-based hormone therapy)  should provide a significant short-term upfront cash payment and long-term revenues from milestones and royalties on sales for Mithra. I believe this is the most important short and medium-term source of revenue for the Company and am working  together with our team  to establish a deal that properly reflects the potential value generated by Mithra’s exceptional research and development team.The symptoms of menopause represent a significant unmet need that is increasingly recognized as requiring treatment by the medical profession and incidence of menopause is growing with our aging population. While symptoms such as hot flashes  night sweats  mood changes  sleep disturbances  joint aches and cognitive difficulties damage the quality of life for millions of women  the adverse effect on women has recently had an estimated societal cost assigned to it  further justifying therapeutic intervention. A newly published Mayo Clinic study estimated $1.8 billion in lost work time per year and $26.6 billion annually when medical expenses are added  in the US alone. Furthermore  data suggest that proper management during pre-menopause and menopause can reduce incidence of dementia and other long-term causes of mortality. Donesta® can play an important role in improving not only women’s quality and quantity of life but also reduce medical costs and improve productivity.We have a pre-NDA meeting with the FDA in the near term to support the filing of our new drug application (NDA) for Donesta®  which has been slightly delayed; we now plan to file it in H2 2023 instead of H1 2023 due to regulatory enquiries  as previously communicated. The expected timing of the marketing authorization for the US remains unchanged at the moment. In Europe  where Donesta® was recently licensed (in key territories) to Gedeon  we are reiterating our guidance on filing and working closely with our partner to support the marketing authorization (MAA) filing  planned for 2024.CDMOExecuting on a strategy to unlock the value of our world-class CDMO facility in Flémalle  is critical to returning the Company to financial health. This state-of-art building holds tremendous capacity and untold potential. In light of the new Company strategies  an in-house manufacturing and development facility is not a strategic asset for the Company  and therefore is currently underutilized  offering untapped potential. Considering strategic options is helping us to realize the full value of the CDMO and leveraging the team’s expertise and versatile capabilities.Europe  and much of the rest of the developed world  is struggling to maintain secure  sustainable drug supplies  with ongoing and varied challenges in supply chains. As such  we are exploring potential strategic solutions for the CDMO that may ultimately benefit multiple parties  including the Flémalle region  Mithra employees and shareholders.Revenue projectionOur product sales are still ramping up but I can share that we are currently projecting total product revenues for Estelle® of about EUR 12 million in 2023 to more than double in 2024 and again in 2025 as they grow to up to approximately EUR 130 million by 2029.Mithra could be cash flow positive in 2026 or  counting possible milestone revenues  potentially even 2025. We currently expect Mithra’s combined revenues from global sales of Estelle®  Donesta® and MyRing® to grow to approximately EUR 300 million by 2029.ConclusionIn conclusion  I believe my priorities as CEO are clear: secure the Company’s finances; secure a U.S. marketing partner for Donesta®; find the best solution for our CDMO; maximize product revenues and  finally  empower our accomplished R&D organization to identify and bring to market new and exciting products for women’s health.To achieve these goals  we must restore Mithra’s financial health  execute on impactful partnerships and focus our internal team’s efforts on delivering the best value from our existing and future pipeline of innovative products  especially Donesta®. Simply put  Mithra can and will navigate through the current situation and ultimately deliver on its promise of becoming a global leader in women’s health.I wish to thank you  our shareholders  for your support during this difficult transition period in the Company’s history  especially in light of the troubling geopolitical and volatile market conditions. I believe communication is an essential part of any successful relationship  especially during difficult periods. I look forward to continuing with increased transparency and regular communications to providing updates on our progress to you  our shareholders.With best regards David Horn SolomonChief Executive OfficerFor more information  please contact:Mithra Pharmaceuticals SADavid Horn SolomonChief Executive Officerinvestorrelations@mithra.com Investor & media relationsChris MaggosCohesion Bureauchris.maggos@cohesionbureau.com+41 79 367 6254For analysts  please contact: Alexandra Deschner (investorrelations@mithra.com) or (adeschner@mithra.com)About MithraMithra (Euronext: MITRA) is a Belgian biotech company dedicated to transforming Women’s Health by offering new choices through innovation  with a particular focus on contraception and menopause.

Lyten  a pioneer of 3D Graphene  will leverage the unique tunability of the material to enable enhanced vehicle performance and customer experience while decarbonizing the transportation sector.Lyten's tunable materials platform has demonstrated significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and will advance the transition to sustainable mobility.Unlike traditional lithium-ion batteries  Lyten's lithium-sulfur batteries do not use nickel  cobalt or manganese  resulting in an estimated 60% lower carbon footprint than today's best-in-class batteries and a pathway to achieve the lowest emissions EV battery on the global market. Raw materials for lithium-sulfur batteries have the potential to be sourced and produced locally in North America or Europe  enhancing regional supply sovereignty. This technology will meet the needs of industries seeking lightweight and energy-dense batteries that are free from supply chain disruptions.Stellantis launched Stellantis Ventures in 2022 as a venture capital fund committed to investing in early and later-stage startup companies developing innovative and sustainable technologies within the automotive and mobility sectors. Stellantis Ventures  powered by an initial €300 million in funding  is a key component of the company's Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan  which sets out core targets for Stellantis  including deep emission cuts to slash CO2 in half by 2030  benchmarking the 2021 metrics  and achieving carbon net zero by 2038 with single-digit percentage compensation of the remaining emissions.""We are delighted that Stellantis Ventures  as the venture investment arm of a global automotive innovator  has demonstrated a strong belief in our company and our Lyten 3D Graphene decarbonizing supermaterials "" said Dan Cook  president and CEO of Lyten. ""Among the automotive product innovations being transformed by Lyten 3D Graphene are lithium-sulfur batteries with the potential to deliver more than twice the energy density of lithium-ion  payload-improving lightweighted vehicle composites  and new modes of sensing that do not require chips  batteries or wires. We are committed to advancing each of these applications to Stellantis and the automotive market.""Cook continued: ""Unlike two-dimensional forms of graphene  the production of our tunable Lyten 3D Graphene has been independently verified to be carbon neutral at scale. We are converting greenhouse gases into a new class of high-performance  high-value carbon materials and are incorporating these tuned materials into applications that will decarbonize the hardest to abate sectors on the planet.""""Having recently visited Lyten together with our CTO Ned Curic and our head of Stellantis Ventures Adam Bazih  we walked away impressed by the potential of this technology to help drive clean  safe and affordable mobility "" said Carlos Tavares  Stellantis CEO. ""Lyten's materials platform is a key investment for Stellantis Ventures  in line with our Dare Forward 2030 goal to accelerate deployment of innovative  customer-centric technologies. Specifically  Lyten's lithium-sulfur battery has the potential to be a key ingredient in enabling mass-market EV adoption globally  and their material technology is equally well positioned to help reduce vehicle weight  which is all necessary for our industry to achieve carbon net zero goals.""With traditional lithium-ion battery materials in critically short supply for EV manufacturing  Lyten's lithium-sulfur battery will offer an alternative  non-nickel-manganese-cobalt cathode solution that supports the global transition to electric vehicles at mass market scale. Lyten's goal is to provide a secure supply of performance-based and environmentally sustainable products to its customers  while also enabling auto manufacturers to take advantage of growing U.S. and European policy incentives  such as those referenced in the Inflation Reduction Act.Lyten's lithium-sulfur battery  composites and sensor technologies are initially being produced on its 145 000-square-foot campus in Silicon Valley. Apart from producing EV batteries  Lyten is working with previous customers to start delivering lithium-sulfur batteries and 3D Graphene-infused composites for specialty markets in 2023. Lyten is collaborating with its strategic investors from across multiple industries to apply Lyten 3D Graphene materials to decarbonize additional  carbon intensive sectors beyond transportation  with more announcements planned for later this year.Lyten 3D GrapheneLyten 3D Graphene is a proprietary  tunable decarbonization supermaterial engineered from natural gas. Lyten's 3D Graphene is similar to two-dimensional graphene in many of its valuable properties; however  3D Graphene can be orders of magnitude more chemically and electrically reactive while also being highly tunable due to its three-dimensional morphology. The processes and equipment to engineer three-dimensional graphene materials are proprietary technological inventions patented by Lyten. Lyten will scale its initial output from its San Jose  California  facility and will soon explore locations for a second phase of output capacity.LytCell EV Lithium-sulfur BatteryLytCell is Lyten's proprietary lithium-sulfur battery that uses Lyten 3D Graphene to address the polysulfide shuttle challenges associated with sulfur  leading to a higher-performance battery that will have more than twice the energy density  and enables extended driving range compared to conventional EV batteries. Unlike lithium-ion and solid-state batteries  LytCell does not use expensive and scarce nickel or cobalt  will have an estimated 60%-plus lower carbon footprint than best-in-class lithium-ion  and an estimated 40% lower carbon footprint than solid state. The LytCell will be domestically and sustainably sourced  liberating manufacturers and consumers from supply chain risks and environmentally unsound mining issues associated with nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) oxide materials.LytRLytR is Lyten's unique thermoplastic formulation – infused with Lyten 3D Graphene – that reduces up to half the weight and materials required while maintaining or improving strength and performance. When Lyten 3D Graphene is tuned for dispersion into polyethylene  as with the LytR material  it significantly strengthens the thermoplastics' chemical and physical properties  thereby requiring less polyethylene material and reducing the carbon footprint by up to 55%.LytenLyten is a materials innovation and applications company and the pioneer of the Lyten 3D Graphene materials platform. Lyten's decarbonization supermaterials are being tuned for a wide range of applications  including the next-generation lithium-sulfur batteries for use in the automotive  aerospace  defense  and other markets; a next-generation LytR polymer composite that can reduce the amount of plastic used by up to half while maintaining structural and impact strength; and next-generation sensor arrays that significantly increase detection sensitivity and selectivity for use in automotive  industrial  health  and safety applications.Lyten is led by a group of experienced executives from across Automotive  Energy  Batteries  Semiconductors  Manufacturing and Defense  lists more than 300 patent matters  and is currently manufacturing Lyten 3D Graphene material  as well as its LytCell EV batteries  in San Jose  California. Lyten was founded in 2015.

Lyten  a pioneer of three- dimensional (3D) Graphene  will leverage the unique tunability of the material to enable enhanced vehicle performance and customer experience while decarbonizing the transportation sector.Lyten’s tunable materials platform has demonstrated significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and will advance the transition to sustainable mobility.Unlike traditional lithium-ion batteries  Lyten’s Lithium-Sulfur batteries do not use nickel  cobalt  or manganese  resulting in an estimated 60% lower carbon footprint than today’s best-in-class batteries and a pathway to achieve the lowest emissions EV battery on the global market. Raw materials for Lithium-Sulfur batteries have the potential to be sourced and produced locally  in North America or Europe  enhancing regional supply sovereignty. This technology will meet the needs of industries seeking lightweight and energy-dense batteries that are free from supply chain disruptions.Stellantis launched Stellantis Ventures in 2022 as a venture capital fund committed to investing in early and later-stage startup companies developing innovative and sustainable technologies within the automotive and mobility sectors. Stellantis Ventures  powered by an initial €300 million in funding  is a key component of the Company’s Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan  which sets out core targets for Stellantis  including deep emission cuts to slash CO 2 in half by 2030  benchmarking the 2021 metrics  and achieving carbon net zero by 2038 with single-digit percentage compensation of the remaining emissions.“We are delighted that Stellantis Ventures  as the venture investment arm of a global automotive innovator  has demonstrated a strong belief in our company and our Lyten 3D Graphene™ decarbonizing supermaterials ” said Dan Cook  president and CEO of Lyten. “Among the automotive product innovations being transformed by Lyten 3D Graphene™ are Lithium-Sulfur batteries with the potential to deliver more than twice the energy density of lithium-ion  payload-improving lightweighted vehicle composites  and new modes of sensing that do not require chips  batteries or wires. We are committed to advancing each of these applications to Stellantis and the automotive market.”Cook continued: “Unlike two-dimensional forms of graphene  the production of our tunable Lyten 3D Graphene™ has been independently verified to be carbon neutral at scale. We are converting greenhouse gases into a new class of high-performance  high-value carbon materials and are incorporating these tuned materials into applications that will decarbonize the hardest to abate sectors on the planet.”“Having recently visited Lyten together with our CTO Ned Curic and our head of Stellantis Ventures  Adam Bazih  we walked away impressed by the potential of this technology to help drive clean  safe and affordable mobility ” said Carlos Tavares  Stellantis CEO. “Lyten’s materials platform is a key investment for Stellantis Ventures  in line with our Dare Forward 2030 goal to accelerate deployment of innovative  customer-centric technologies. Specifically  Lyten’s Lithium-Sulfur battery has the potential to be a key ingredient in enabling mass-market EV adoption globally  and their material technology is equally well positioned to help reduce vehicle weight  which is all necessary for our industry to achieve carbon net zero goals.”With traditional lithium-ion battery materials in critically short supply for EV manufacturing  Lyten’s Lithium-Sulfur battery will offer an alternative  non-nickel-manganese-cobalt cathode solution that supports the global transition to electric vehicles at mass market scale. Lyten’s goal is to provide a secure supply of performance-based and environmentally sustainable products to its customers  while also enabling auto manufacturers to take advantage of growing U.S. and European policy incentives  such as those referenced in the Inflation Reduction Act.Lyten’s Lithium-Sulfur battery  composites  and sensor technologies are initially being produced on its 145 000 square foot campus in Silicon Valley. Apart from producing EV batteries  Lyten is working with previous customers to start delivering Lithium-Sulfur batteries and 3D Graphene-infused composites for specialty markets in 2023. Lyten is collaborating with its strategic investors from across multiple industries to apply Lyten 3D Graphene materials to decarbonize additional  carbon intensive sectors beyond transportation  with more announcements planned for later this year.# # #About Lyten 3D Graphene™Lyten 3D Graphene™ is a proprietary  tunable decarbonization supermaterial engineered from natural gas. Lyten’s 3D Graphene is similar to two-dimensional graphene in many of its valuable properties  however  3D Graphene can be orders of magnitude more chemically and electrically reactive while also being highly tunable due to its three-dimensional morphology. The processes and equipment to engineer three-dimensional graphene materials are proprietary technological inventions patented by Lyten. Lyten will scale its initial output from its San Jose  California facility and will soon explore locations for a second phase of output capacity.About LytCell EV™ Lithium-Sulfur batteryLytCell™ is Lyten’s proprietary Lithium-Sulfur battery that uses Lyten 3D Graphene™ to address the polysulfide shuttle challenges associated with sulfur  leading to a higher-performance battery that will have more than twice the energy density  and enables extended driving range compared to conventional EV batteries. Unlike lithium-ion and solid-state batteries  LytCell™ does not use expensive and scarce nickel or cobalt  will have an estimated 60+ percent lower carbon footprint than best-in-class lithium-ion  and an estimated 40 percent lower carbon footprint than solid state. The LytCell will be domestically and sustainably sourced  liberating manufacturers and consumers from supply chain risks and environmentally unsound mining issues associated with nickel-manganese-cobalt oxide (NMC) materials.About LytR™LytR™ is Lyten’s unique thermoplastic formulation – infused with Lyten 3D Graphene™ – that reduces up to half the weight and materials required while maintaining or improving strength and performance. When Lyten 3D Graphene™ is tuned for dispersion into polyethylene  as with the LytR™ material  it significantly strengthens the thermoplastics’ chemical and physical properties  thereby requiring less polyethylene material and reducing the carbon footprint by up to 55%.About LytenLyten is a materials innovation and applications company and the pioneer of the Lyten 3D Graphene™ materials platform.

I was made fully aware of the Company’s recent challenges and the many justified concerns of our shareholders. I accepted the role because my analysis revealed strong fundamentals and tremendous potential to create significant value for Mithra shareholders. Because of our current situation  I want to be transparent with regards to our strategy in this critical period and address the most important questions of our shareholders. I will lay out in this letter our most important priorities for the coming year as we work to build solid new foundations for Mithra’s future growth.Three key positive points stood out in my assessment of Mithra: first  our research and development organization’s accomplishments show that it is one of the best in the industry; second  Estelle® and Donesta® are not yet fairly valued as highly differentiated innovative therapeutics for women’s health; and  third  our underexploited contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO)  holds value that can be unlocked. Given the disappointments the Company has had  and the outsized impact these events have had on our valuation  I am working intensively with Mithra leadership to effect change expeditiously so that the Company can once again be recognized for its achievements and fundamental value.In order to do this we have three short-term corporate priorities: first  we must provide the financial resources that the Company needs; second  we are in advanced discussions to close a licensing deal for U.S. marketing rights for Donesta®; third  we are actively exploring potential options that would allow us to maximize the value of our CDMO facility and regain sharper focus on the core business.While our generics business also holds value and could serve to diversify our portfolio of products in the long-run  it is a low margin business that can act as a brake on growth while also taking our focus from our core strength - development of best-in-class innovative novel therapeutics. We will look to re-focus on the areas where we can compete most effectively  and this may mean that we could sell or explore other strategic options for our generic products business.I am eager to leverage my 30 years of experience in strategic  operational  and innovation-focused leadership to catalyse the exceptional team at Mithra as we work in lockstep to generate shareholder value. In addition  we aim at adding experienced executives with complementary competencies to our senior management and our board of directors over the course of the coming year. My track record has been built on successful product development delivery and high value strategic partnerships  best exemplified by the achievements of Zealand Pharma and Silence Therapeutics. In each of these cases  we have established U.S. operations to pursue our interests in the most important commercial market  and I intend to do the same for Mithra.As a top priority  I have been working closely with our CFO to secure Mithra’s finances in order to empower the Company to pursue our new strategy. I am pleased that after only one month in my role  we are announcing today that we have taken a critical first step by obtaining commitments for EUR 2.5 million in new equity and access to EUR 12.5 million in new funds from drawing under Tranche C while simultaneously improving some of the financial terms of our convertible loan facility from funds managed by Highbridge Capital Management LLC (""Highbridge"") and funds managed by Whitebox Advisors LLC (""Whitebox"")  who have indicated to me their strong support for Mithra and our new strategy.While it is an important positive step that enables us to pursue other pressing corporate activities with greater confidence  further step-wise improvements to our financial health are key. We are therefore working to affect a full refinancing of our debt obligations during the second half of this year. In addition to acquiring the requisite financial resources  we want to align shareholder interests such that future increases in our product revenues will benefit all shareholders and motivate new ones to join us  so as to deliver on value creation for patients as well as shareholders.Collectively  the Mithra leadership understands that our ability to create value for our shareholders is a primary directive that goes hand in hand with developing medicines for women. While most of our attention is focused on immediate priorities  such as the company’s finances  negotiating favorable terms for Donesta with a U.S. marketing partner  and exploring strategic options for our CDMO  I am also looking forward and planning for Mithra’s growth.In the medium term  we will look to maximize sales of Estelle® and Donesta® by continuing to develop them in new indications and also conducting studies to produce data (in support of our partners’ marketing efforts) demonstrating their unique points of differentiation compared to other products on the market. Longer term  we will look to continue to source and develop new products for women’s health  potentially through in-licensing or acquisitions.Our ambition is to become a global leader in women’s health. Therefore  Mithra will work to replenish its pipeline through organic growth as well as partnering. We will work with international investors and stakeholders to introduce our ambition and rebuild our business and are establishing a US representation office.Financial UpdateToday we announced that we have successfully reached an agreement to update the terms of our loan facility agreement with Highbridge and Whitebox  a first step to put Mithra back on secure financial footing.Following successful negotiation with key debt providers  Highbridge and Whitebox  Mithra will receive access to EUR 12.5 million of Tranche C. Furthermore  existing convertible loans that had a floating conversion price have been successfully renegotiated to new fix conversion price of EUR 2.75 (a premium of 25% over the price for the new equity round to be subscribed for by Highbridge and Whitebox  subject to customary anti-dilution and takeover protections). The loan interest coupon will be adjusted in line with current market conditions from 7.5% to 8.0% for Tranche A and B  and 9% for newly drawn Tranche C. Access to EUR 12.5 million of Tranche C and the other amendments to the convertible loan facility with Highbridge and Whitebox are subject to conditions and subject to finalizing additional contractual agreements. In an effort to further minimize equity dilution going forward  the Company intends no longer to make drawings under the GSI facility. As an evidence of strong support for Mithra’s long-term growth  Highbridge and Whitebox have elected to subscribe for EUR 2.5 million of new shares to be issued by the Company at an issue price of EUR 2.20  a 14% discount to the arithmetic mean of the five trailing daily VWAPs  a favourable market rate. The capital increase is expected to be completed later today.At the end of April  Mithra’s unaudited cash position was about EUR 26 million on a proforma basis. At the same time  our projected 2023 research and development spend is approximately EUR 60 million. It goes without saying that the cash level must be taken into account during negotiations; now  thanks to this new capital  as well as access to additional cash via the amended loan facility  I believe we can leverage our improved financial strength with confidence to negotiate U.S. marketing rights to Donesta®as well consider options for our CDMO facility. Furthermore  we can also work in good faith to achieve another mutually acceptable amendment: one that will align the Uteron Sellers with Mithra’s long-term growth and success.Considering our current financial status  the amendment demonstrates Highbridge and Whitebox are strongly supportive of our strategy and committed to support Mithra’s long-term growth.Estelle®Our first marketed product Estelle® composed of 15 mg Estetrol (E4) and 3 mg Drospirenone (DRSP)  is the first and only contraceptive pill containing Estetrol  a native estrogen. Estetrol shows a specific mode of action compared to other estrogens. Estetrol has also a beneficial impact on the cardiovascular system  brain  bone and endometrium; unlike other estrogens  it has a limited impact on the liver and breast tissue. This unique mode of action results in an improved benefit/risk profile compared to other estrogens.Because of its unique mode of action and safety profile  we believe Estetrol represents a major breakthrough in women’s health starting with contraception and potentially for menopause. While it is only just beginning to generate significant value for shareholders  we believe that our marketing partners in U.S. and Europe (Mayne Pharma and Gedeon Richter  respectively)  will be able to further optimize commercial exploitation of these assets.Estelle®was recently commercialized in the US  Canada and Europe. It is the first new estrogen introduced in the US in more than 50 years.Donesta®A US licensing deal for Donesta® (estetrol-based hormone therapy)  should provide a significant short-term upfront cash payment and long-term revenues from milestones and royalties on sales for Mithra. I believe this is the most important short and medium-term source of revenue for the Company and am working  together with our team  to establish a deal that properly reflects the potential value generated by Mithra’s exceptional research and development team.The symptoms of menopause represent a significant unmet need that is increasingly recognized as requiring treatment by the medical profession and incidence of menopause is growing with our aging population. While symptoms such as hot flashes  night sweats  mood changes  sleep disturbances  joint aches and cognitive difficulties damage the quality of life for millions of women  the adverse effect on women has recently had an estimated societal cost assigned to it  further justifying therapeutic intervention. A newly published Mayo Clinic study estimated $1.8 billion in lost work time per year and $26.6 billion annually when medical expenses are added  in the US alone. Furthermore  data suggest that proper management during pre-menopause and menopause can reduce incidence of dementia and other long-term causes of mortality. Donesta® can play an important role in improving not only women’s quality and quantity of life but also reduce medical costs and improve productivity.We have a pre-NDA meeting with the FDA in the near term to support the filing of our new drug application (NDA) for Donesta®  which has been slightly delayed; we now plan to file it in H2 2023 instead of H1 2023 due to regulatory enquiries  as previously communicated. The expected timing of the marketing authorization for the US remains unchanged at the moment. In Europe  where Donesta® was recently licensed (in key territories) to Gedeon  we are reiterating our guidance on filing and working closely with our partner to support the marketing authorization (MAA) filing  planned for 2024.CDMOExecuting on a strategy to unlock the value of our world-class CDMO facility in Flémalle  is critical to returning the Company to financial health. This state-of-art building holds tremendous capacity and untold potential. In light of the new Company strategies  an in-house manufacturing and development facility is not a strategic asset for the Company  and therefore is currently underutilized  offering untapped potential. Considering strategic options is helping us to realize the full value of the CDMO and leveraging the team’s expertise and versatile capabilities.Europe  and much of the rest of the developed world  is struggling to maintain secure  sustainable drug supplies  with ongoing and varied challenges in supply chains. As such  we are exploring potential strategic solutions for the CDMO that may ultimately benefit multiple parties  including the Flémalle region  Mithra employees and shareholders.Revenue projectionOur product sales are still ramping up but I can share that we are currently projecting total product revenues for Estelle® of about EUR 12 million in 2023 to more than double in 2024 and again in 2025 as they grow to up to approximately EUR 130 million by 2029.Mithra could be cash flow positive in 2026 or  counting possible milestone revenues  potentially even 2025. We currently expect Mithra’s combined revenues from global sales of Estelle®  Donesta® and MyRing® to grow to approximately EUR 300 million by 2029.ConclusionIn conclusion  I believe my priorities as CEO are clear: secure the Company’s finances; secure a U.S. marketing partner for Donesta®; find the best solution for our CDMO; maximize product revenues and  finally  empower our accomplished R&D organization to identify and bring to market new and exciting products for women’s health.To achieve these goals  we must restore Mithra’s financial health  execute on impactful partnerships and focus our internal team’s efforts on delivering the best value from our existing and future pipeline of innovative products  especially Donesta®. Simply put  Mithra can and will navigate through the current situation and ultimately deliver on its promise of becoming a global leader in women’s health.I wish to thank you  our shareholders  for your support during this difficult transition period in the Company’s history  especially in light of the troubling geopolitical and volatile market conditions. I believe communication is an essential part of any successful relationship  especially during difficult periods. I look forward to continuing with increased transparency and regular communications to providing updates on our progress to you  our shareholders.With best regards David Horn SolomonChief Executive OfficerFor more information  please contact:Mithra Pharmaceuticals SADavid Horn SolomonChief Executive Officerinvestorrelations@mithra.com Investor & media relationsChris MaggosCohesion Bureauchris.maggos@cohesionbureau.com+41 79 367 6254For analysts  please contact: Alexandra Deschner (investorrelations@mithra.com) or (adeschner@mithra.com)About MithraMithra (Euronext: MITRA) is a Belgian biotech company dedicated to transforming Women’s Health by offering new choices through innovation  with a particular focus on contraception and menopause.

Simultaneously  the Company is optimising its portfolio to focus on its most advanced and promising pipeline assets.The new strategic plan:Maximises the impact of BenevolentAI’s innovative technology platform for commercial deployment through new revenue-generating products  collaborations and partnerships.Prioritises the Company’s most advanced and high-potential clinical and pre-clinical assets  progressing them to their value inflection points.Reduces spending and frees up £45 million of net cash to increase the Company’s financial flexibility  extending the cash runway to at least July 2025 (without accounting for any new revenue).Aligns organisational structure to the new strategic direction.As part of the strategic plan  the Company will streamline and reorganise operations across two distinct business units – the Tech Business Unit and the Bio Business Unit – supported by Shared Business Operations. This will improve capital efficiency and enhance operational effectiveness.Chief Executive Officer  Joanna Shields said  “Embarking on this process requires difficult decisions  particularly concerning our valued colleagues. Our new strategic direction ensures we maximise our portfolio and leverage the knowledge and expertise we have built up in recent years to meet this moment of opportunity for AI in biopharma.”Tech Business Unit– well positioned to lead in AI for biopharma R&DBenevolentAI is deploying a new suite of AI products  including a natural language biomedical querying system  enabling biopharma partners to accelerate new discoveries  harness the power of AI to unlock the value of their data  and gain a competitive edge. The Company will expand its commercialisation of this technology through collaborations and partnerships.The adoption of generative AI and large language models offers unparalleled potential to accelerate scientific discovery. BenevolentAI is uniquely positioned to bring this transformative impact to biopharma R&D with its in-depth experience in drug discovery and knowledge of how to build  train and fine-tune these highly domain-specific models. The platform’s generative AI and query capabilities are further enhanced by BenevolentAI’s technology for drug discovery  including its leading target identification and assessment platform and proven expertise in multi-modal biomedical data integration.Bio Business Unit – focusing resources on high-value assetsBenevolentAI will streamline its portfolio  focusing on taking its most advanced and high-potential assets to their key value inflection points. These prioritised drug programmes are as follows:BEN-8744  a potentially best-in-class PDE10 inhibitor for the treatment of Ulcerative Colitis  represents a novel target for this indication  which will enter Phase 1 in Q3 2023.BEN-28010  a potentially best-in-class CNS-penetrant CHK1 inhibitor for the treatment of Glioblastoma Multiforme  is expected to be IND-ready by Q4 2023.Earlier-stage assets in neurodegenerative and immunological diseases (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis  Parkinson’s Disease  and Fibrosis).As a result of this streamlining  the Company will reduce its lab footprint and expenditures and pause selected programmes while retaining key drug discovery and target identification capabilities and adopting a strategic outsourcing model. The Company will not invest further in BEN-2293 following its Phase 2a trial results.Organisational changesAs part of the strategic review  the Company has considered its cost base and organisational structure and will commence a collective consultation process around proposed headcount reductions expected to result in net cost savings of £45 million  which extends its cash runway to at least July 2025  without accounting for any new revenues.These net savings are expected to be realised through £13 million in facilities and other operating expenses and £32 million in reduced drug programme and staff costs  representing a reduction of up to approximately 180 employees. The Company will adhere to the UK Collective Consultation for Redundancy Rules and Procedures.Alongside this news  Nicholas Keher has provided notice of his resignation as Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of the Company to pursue other business interests. The Company thanks him for his service and wishes him well in his future endeavours. Tom Holgate  SVP and Group Finance Director  will act as interim CFO and provide transitional support while a search is conducted for Nicholas’ replacement.In summary  this strategic review and reorganisation positions BenevolentAI to maximise value creation for stakeholders.About BenevolentAIBenevolentAI (AMS: BAI) is a leading developer of advanced artificial intelligence technologies that unlock the value of multimodal data  surface novel insights  and accelerate biomedical discovery.

This significant cash inflow is a first step to cover ongoing developments.However  to support the growth strategy and meet the increased regulatory and clinical expenses related to the new Medical Device Regulation (MDR)  the group is seeking to secure its cash position through additional funding.Conclusion of a financing agreement in the form of bonds convertible into shares in the amount of €10 990 000Spineway has accordingly implemented financing through bonds convertible into shares (the “OCA”) in the amount of €10 990 000. Aware that this type of financing is detrimental to the stock market valuation  the Group has sought to limit dilution as much as possible. As such  no warrants shall be attached to the bonds issued. This financing will allow Spineway to secure its development during this period  with the aim of significantly increasing its profitability within three years on a stronger business scope.Details of the financing are appended to this press release and will also be available on the Company’s website.At the end of this period  Spineway should be in a sound and predictable financial position  allowing it to access classic financing.Disclaimer:Spineway arranged this financing in the form of bonds convertible into shares (the “OCA”) with Negma Group Investment Ltd (“Negma”)  which  after receiving the shares resulting from the conversion or exercise of these instruments  will not remain a shareholder of the Company.The shares resulting from the conversion or exercise of the aforementioned securities could be sold on the market within very short timeframes  which could create strong downward pressure on the share price.Shareholders could suffer a loss of their invested capital due to a significant fall in the value of the Company’s shares  as well as significant dilution due to the large number of securities issued to Negma.Investors are advised to exercise particular caution before deciding to invest in Spineway securities.The Company notes that this is not the first time it has implemented dilutive financing.In particular  investors should be aware of the risks associated with this type of transaction  as mentioned in this press release.Next event : July 11  2023 – H1 2023 revenueSPINEWAY IS ELIGIBLE FOR PEA-SME (EQUITY SAVINGS PLANS FOR SMES)Find out all about Spineway at www.spineway.comThis press release has been prepared in both English and French.

The Company’s Board of Directors has decided to set up a financing line with Negma Group Investment Ltd  an investment company specializing in the provision of flexible debt or equity-linked financing to SMEs (the “Investor”).At its meeting of May 24  2023  the Board of Directors  acting in accordance with the aforementioned delegation  authorized the implementation of equity line financing and:(i) authorized the Chief Executive Officer to finalize and sign the documentation and to draw down the first tranche; and(ii) delegated to the Chief Executive Officer the power to draw down each subsequent tranche during the term of the Issuance Agreement without the need to seek prior approval from the Board of Directors.Concurrently with the signing of the Issuance Agreement  the Chairman of the Board of Directors issued the first financing tranche of five hundred thousand euros (€500 000)  consisting of 200 OCAs  subscribed for in full by the Investor.Each OCA will have a nominal value of two thousand five hundred euros (€2 500).Each subsequent tranche of OCAs will represent a total nominal amount of two hundred fifty thousand euros (€250 000)  which may exceptionally be increased to five hundred fifty thousand euros (€550 000) if certain conditions set out in the Issuance Agreement are met and depending on the volume of shares traded.The Investor’s objective is to allow the Company to raise funds on a step-by-step basis. It does not intend to keep the shares and remain a shareholder of the Company on a long-term basis  but rather to sell them gradually on the market.It is stipulated that this Transaction will not give rise to the preparation of a prospectus subject to the approval of the Autorité des Marchés Financiers.The Company will post an up-to-date table summarizing the OCAs and the number of shares outstanding on its website.MAIN CHARACTERISTICS OF THE OCAS:Holders of OCAs have the right to convert  on the trading day of their choice  all or part of their OCAs by submitting a conversion notice to the Company.Tranches Each tranche of OCAs will represent a total nominal amount of bonds ranging from two hundred fifty thousand euros (€250 000)  which may exceptionally be increased to five hundred fifty thousand euros (€550 000) if certain conditions set out in the Issuance Agreement are met and depending on the volume of shares traded  in a maximum total amount of ten million nine hundred ninety thousand euros (€10 990 000)  for which the Investor will subscribe at the request of the Company at the end of a sixty-six (66) trading day interim period between each drawdown  subject to certain conditions set out in the Issuance Agreement (in particular the absence of an event of default  material adverse change or change of control of the Company  listing of Company shares  etc.). Consequently  the total number of Tranches is unknown as of the date of signature of this Issuance Agreement.It is stipulated that the first tranche of five hundred thousand euros (€500 000) was issued on the date of signature of the Issuance Agreement  i.e. May 24  2023.Minimum Commitment Period During each period of four (4) months from the date of signature of the Issuance Agreement  the Investor undertakes to subscribe  each time after acceptance by the Issuer  for one or more tranches in a maximum total amount of two million euros (€2 000 000).It is stipulated that the first period runs from the date of signature of the Issuance Agreement and will end on September 24  2023.As long as the minimum commitment of two million one hundred ninety-seven thousand five hundred euros (€2 197 500) has not been reached  the Investor may  at any time during the relevant minimum commitment period  submit a request to subscribe for a new Tranche to the Issuer  which will be free to refuse or accept in writing  in accordance with the terms set out in the Issuance Agreement.Form of the OCAsRegistered form Nominal value of the OCAs€2 500 Subscription price of the OCAsThe subscription price of the OCAs will be 91% of their nominal value  i.e. two thousand two hundred seventy-five euros (€2 275) for each OCA.MaturityTwelve months from the date of issue Interest rate0% Listing of the OCAsThe OCAs will not be listed TransferThe OCAs may not be assigned or transferred without the prior consent of the Company  except to affiliates of the Investor.Redemption at maturity If the OCAs have not been converted into shares or redeemed by their maturity date  the OCA holder will be required to request their conversion into shares.Event of default The events of default provided for in the Issuance Agreement are the usual events of default for transactions of this type  including failure by the Company to comply with its undertakings under the Issuance Agreement  delisting or withdrawal of the Company’s shares  refusal of the statutory auditors to certify the Company’s financial statements  default in respect of another significant debt of the Company  material adverse change or change of control  etc.Conversion of the OCAs The OCAs may be converted into new ordinary shares at the request of the holder at any time after their issue and until their maturity date  in accordance with the conversion ratio determined by dividing the nominal amount of the converted OCAs by the conversion price.The conversion ratio and the number of shares to be issued may be calculated by applying the following formula:N = Vn / PWhere“N” is the number of shares issued or delivered by the Issuer to the relevant OCA holder upon conversion of one or more OCAs;“Vn” is the total nominal value of the OCAs to be converted;“P” is 95% of the lowest daily volume-weighted average price of the Company’s shares for a period of fifteen (15) trading days immediately preceding the conversion date of the OCAs (the “Conversion Price”).It is stipulated that the Conversion Price may not be less than (i) the nominal value of the share  or (ii) the minimum issue price per share provided for in the first resolution of the Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders held on April 4  2023  i.e. 80% of the volume-weighted average of the Company’s share price over the thirty (30) trading days preceding the conversion date of the OCAs. In the event that P is less than the nominal value of the share  the Company has undertaken contractually to compensate the Investor for the loss resulting from the conversion of the OCAs of the said tranche at the nominal value of the share  whereas their theoretical conversion price calculated on the basis of the stock market price would be less than the nominal value of the share (the “Compensation”).Payment of the Compensation will be made:(i) in cash or in kind  at the Company’s discretionby issuing new OCAs subscribed for by the Investorby way of set-off against a claim that is certain  liquid and due; and(ii) at the earlier of the two dates between:every twenty-fifth (25th) of the month following the date of the notification of conversion of the relevant OCA; andthe issue of the next tranche of OCAs.OTHER CHARACTERISTICS:New shares The new shares of the Company issued upon conversion of one or more OCAs will be subject to all provisions of the Bylaws  as well as to the decisions of the General Meetings of Shareholders of the Company. New shares will be admitted to trading on Euronext Growth Paris from the date of their issue  will immediately carry dividend rights and will be fully assimilated and fungible with the existing shares of the Company.Duration/Termination The Issuance Agreement is concluded for a period of twenty-four (24) months.The Issuance Agreement may be terminated in the event of an Event of Default.Commitment

additional potential dilutive instruments are the warrants issued under the previous OCABSA financing agreements  representing 82 398 additional potential sharesThe main risks associated with the Transaction are as follows:(i) The Transaction could have a more or less significant dilutive effect depending on the extent to which the financing is drawn down  as the Investor converts the OCAs. The potential impact of the Transaction on shareholders’ investments and their share of equity is described above.(ii) The Transaction could have an impact on the degree of volatility and liquidity of the Company’s shares  which could vary significantly.(iii) The Transaction could have an impact on the share price when shares resulting from the conversion of OCAs by the Investor are sold on the market.(iv) In the event that all tranches are not issued  the Company may need to seek additional financing. The total amount of the OCA issue is not guaranteed and will depend notably on market conditions and the authorization given by the General Meeting  if any.Attachment,positive,0.92,0.07,0.0,mixed,0.35,0.15,0.5,True,English,"['cash position', 'new financing', 'Rhône Alpes INPI Patent Innovation award', '8-year €1.5 million Participative Stimulus Loan', 'Stéphane Le Roux', 'Prêt Participatif Relance', 'less invasive spine surgery', 'new Medical Device Regulation', 'INPI Talent award', 'OSEO Excellence award', 'Deloitte Fast 50 award', 'Negma Group Investment Ltd', 'two operating techniques', 'stronger business scope', 'strong downward pressure', 'EQUITY SAVINGS PLANS', 'predictable financial position', 'R&D investments', 'stock market valuation', 'French unit trusts', 'new growth trajectory', 'significant cash inflow', 'Spine Innovations', 'product innovation', 'innovation strategy', 'cash position', 'New financing', 'significant fall', 'Press release', 'genuine transformation', 'product offering', 'premium products', 'sustained investment', 'medium term', 'innovative implants', 'severe disorders', 'spinal column', 'geographical footprint', 'first quarter', 'innovative companies', 'first step', 'clinical expenses', 'additional funding', 'three years', 'short timeframes', 'share price', 'large number', 'particular caution', 'first time', 'Next event', 'French version', 'international network', '50 independent distributors', 'Shareholder-services line', 'Eligible PEA', 'Investor relations', 'significant dilution', 'Euronext Growth', 'The Group', 'future developments', 'ongoing developments', 'English French', 'surgical instruments', 'ALSPW Contacts', 'growth strategy', 'financing agreement', 'classic financing', 'dilutive financing', 'innovative company', 'The Company', 'H1 2023 revenue', 'Spineway CEO', 'Spineway designs', 'sales development', 'a year', 'Spineway Group', 'Spineway securities', '8 a', 'Ecully', 'Strengthening', 'support', 'values', 'purpose', 'organization', 'aim', 'benchmark', 'range', 'policy', 'France', 'return', 'profitability', 'specialist', 'treatment', 'acquisitions', 'Distimp', 'June', 'July', 'fusion', 'start', '79% increase', 'Receipt', 'PPR', 'status', 'regulatory', 'MDR', 'Conclusion', 'bonds', 'shares', 'amount', 'OCA', 'type', 'warrants', 'period', 'Details', 'website', 'sound', 'conversion', 'exercise', 'Shareholders', 'loss', 'capital', 'Investors', 'risks', 'transaction', 'PEA-SME', 'SMES', 'case', 'discrepancies', 'exports', 'FCPIs', 'ISIN', 'Tuesday', 'Thursday', 'Aelium', 'Finance', 'Communication', '2022']",2023-05-25,2023-05-26,globenewswire.com

The new results announced today are derived from a data extraction performed on April 25th  2023  which are still consistent with a long-term treatment effect for CMT1A patients treated with PXT3003 High Dose (‘HD') in the PLEO-CMT-FU Period 2 trial with a data readout at6 years/72 months of total trial time (15 months of PLEO-CMT trial + 9 months of PLEO-CMT-FU trial period 1 + 48 months of PLEO-CMT-FU trial period 2).Please refer to an illustration of the first PXT3003 Phase III program design in the “About the PLEO-CMT-FU Trial” section below for more details (pdf version only  available on Pharnext website).Key features of the new data analysis are as follows:PXT3003 continues to show a good tolerability and safety profile over the course of the first Phase III program (double-blind + ongoing open-label).PXT3003 continues to show encouraging efficacy results as measured on the Overall Neuropathy Limitations Scale (‘ONLS') which evaluates the patient's functional motor disability. The best efficacy signal is still observed in the cohort of patients treated with PXT3003 HD during 6 years of total trial time (double blind + ongoing open-label). Patients treated with placebo declined on ONLS during the double-blind phase and then switching on PXT3003 HD stopped on average the natural decline of the disease.Please refer to the illustration of the ONLS data below for more details (pdf version only  available on Pharnext website).Shahram Attarian  MD  PhD  Head of the Neuromuscular Diseases and ALS department at the University Hospital La Timone in Marseille (France)  Coordinator of the FILNEMUS Rare Diseases Network and Neuromuscular Diseases Reference Centers in France  and Lead Investigator of the PLEO-CMT  PLEO-CMT-FU and PREMIER trials in Europe  said: “The data announced today  while generated from an open-label extension study  are consistent with a long-term treatment benefit  safety and efficacy  of PXT3003 High Dose in CMT1A. Showing stabilization  or even improvement versus baseline after 6 years of total trial time is extremely encouraging as these patients would have  on average  declined following the natural course of CMT1A with the current standard of care.As an investigator involved since the beginning in the clinical development of PXT3003 in CMT1A  I am really looking forward to seeing the topline results of the ongoing pivotal Phase III clinical study  the PREMIER trial  expected at the end of this year. The entire CMT community is hopeful that the results of the PREMIER trial are positive and could lead to a specifically approved therapy for this debilitating disease.”Results of First Double-Blind Phase III (PLEO-CMT) & Open-Label Extension (PLEO-CMT-FU)Studies of PXT3003 with an ONLS Data Readout at 72 Months of Total Trial Time**Results based on database extraction done on April 25th  2023.a Cohort of CMT1A patients treated with PXT3003 High Dose during PLEO-CMT and ongoing PLEO-CMT-FU trialsb Cohort of CMT1A patients treated with PXT3003 Low Dose during PLEO-CMT + PLEO-CMT-FU Period 1  and then switched to PXT3003 High Dose during PLEO-CMT-FU period 2c Cohort of CMT1A patients treated with placebo during PLEO-CMT  PXT3003 Low Dose or High Dose during PLEO-CMT-FU Period 1 and PXT3003 High Dose during PLEO-CMT-FU Period 2Please refer to a graphic illustration of the first double-blind Phase III (PLEO-CMT) and open-label extension (PLEO-CMT-FU) studies design in the “About the PLEO-CMT-FU Trial” section below.About the PLEO-CMT TrialThe PLEO-CMT trial was an international  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled  Phase III study evaluating the efficacy and safety of PXT3003 in patients with CMT1A  over a 15-month period. Two dose levels  named low dose (‘LD') and high dose (‘HD')  of PXT3003 in comparison to placebo were tested in patients diagnosed with mild-to-moderate CMT1A (HD equals double LD). A total of 323 patients were enrolled in 29 centers across Europe  the U.S. and Canada by December 2016 and last-patient-last-visit occurred in March 2018. Due to an unexpected issue in the HD formulation  the HD arm was prematurely stopped in September 2017. A revised statistical analysis plan was developed to take into account the premature HD arm discontinuation. Analysis of the primary endpoint  Overall Neuropathy Limitations Scale (‘ONLS') from all investigated populations in the HD arm suggested preliminary efficacy in humans. The study further demonstrated the safety and tolerability of PXT3003. Further information on the PLEO-CMT trial  including study results  can be found on the ClinicalTrials.gov website (study identification number: NCT03023540) here or in the following publication: https://ojrd.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13023-021-02040-8.pdf.About the PLEO-CMT-FU TrialAll randomized CMT1A patients who completed the PLEO-CMT trial (treated with PXT3003 or placebo) were eligible to pursue treatment with PXT3003 in the PLEO-CMT-FU trial. This trial enrolled a total of 187 patients and was designed to primarily assess the long-term safety and tolerability of PXT3003. It was initially planned to be a double-blind  nine-month  Phase III follow-up extension study where patients treated with PXT3003 in the PLEO-CMT trial were eligible to continue their treatment at the same dose (High dose ‘HD' or Low Dose ‘LD'). Patients treated with placebo in the PLEO-CMT trial were randomized in PLEO-CMT-FU to receive LD or HD of PXT3003. Due to the PXT3003 HD formulation issue which occurred during the PLEO-CMT trial  the HD arm was discontinued in September 2017. Consequently  the PLEO-CMT-FU trial became an open-label study divided into two periods:Period 1 (9-month treatment period) from March 2017 to April 2019. Patients randomized to PXT3003 LD in PLEO-CMT continued on the same dose. Patients randomized to PXT3003 HD in PLEO-CMT continued on the same dose  but it was given as twice the volume of PXT3003 LD formulation after the PXT3003 HD formulation issue. Patients randomized to placebo in PLEO-CMT continued only on PXT3003 LD after the HD formulation issue.Period 2 from July 2018 (still on-going). The 153 patients who entered in PLEO-CMT-FU Period 2 were all switched to PXT3003 HD given as twice the volume of PXT3003 LD formulation.In PLEO-CMT-FU  on top of safety and tolerability of PXT3003 which is evaluated every 3 months  long-term efficacy is evaluated with the Overall Neuropathy Limitations Scale (‘ONLS') measured every 6 months.Further information on the PLEO-CMT-FU trial can be found on the ClinicalTrials.gov website (study identification number: NCT03023540) here.Design of First Double-Blind Phase III (PLEO-CMT) andOpen-Label Extension (PLEO-CMT-FU) Studies of PXT3003About the PREMIER TrialThe PREMIER trial is an international  randomized  double-blind  two-arm placebo-controlled  pivotal Phase III study  evaluating the efficacy and safety of PXT3003 versus placebo in mild-to-moderate CMT1A patients  over a 15-month period. The dose of PXT3003 tested in the PREMIER trial corresponds to the high dose (‘HD') tested in the prior Phase III trial (‘PLEO-CMT'). As agreed with regulatory agencies  the primary efficacy endpoint will be the Overall Neuropathy Limitations Scale (‘ONLS') which measures functional motor disability. The secondary endpoints include the following outcome measures: 1) 10-Meter Walk Test (‘10mWT')  2) Quantified Muscular Testing (bilateral foot dorsiflexion dynamometry)  3) Patient Global Impression of Severity (‘PGI-S')  4) Patient Global Impression of Change (‘PGI-C')  5) Charcot-Marie-Tooth Neuropathy Score  version 2 (‘CMTNS-v2')  and 6) Quantified Muscular Testing (hand grip). Safety and tolerability will be monitored throughout the study. Further information on the PREMIER trial can be found on the ClinicalTrials.gov website (study identification number: NCT04762758) here.About Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease Type 1A (‘CMT1A')Charcot-Marie-Tooth (‘CMT') disease encompasses a heterogeneous group of inherited  severe  debilitating  progressive and chronic peripheral neuropathies. CMT1A  the most common type of CMT  is an orphan disease with a prevalence of 1/5000 people affecting about 150 000 people in Europe and the U.S. and about 1 500 000 people worldwide. The genetic mutation responsible for CMT1A is a duplication of the PMP22 gene coding for a peripheral myelin protein. The duplication of this gene results in overexpression of the PMP22 protein and failure of Schwann cells to produce normal myelin (neuronal sheath). The lack of a normal myelin structure and function leads to abnormal peripheral nerve conduction and axonal loss. As a result of peripheral nerve degradation  patients suffer from progressive muscle atrophy in both the legs and arms causing problems with walking  running and balance as well as abnormal hand functioning. They might also suffer from mild to moderate sensory disorders. First symptoms usually appear during adolescence and will progressively evolve throughout life. Patients with the most severe form of CMT1A end up in wheelchairs  representing at least 5% of cases. To date  no curative or symptomatic medications have been approved and treatment consists of supportive care such as orthotics  leg braces  physical and occupational therapy or surgery. More information can be found at here.About PXT3003PXT3003 is a novel fixed-dose synergistic combination of baclofen  naltrexone and sorbitol formulated as an oral solution given twice a day. The three individual components of PXT3003 were selected to downregulate the overexpression of PMP22 protein  leading to improvement of neuronal signaling in dysfunctional peripheral nerves that are an essential part of the pathophysiology of this disease. PXT3003 could also have a positive effect on other cellular types of the motor unit such as the axon (direct protection)  neuromuscular junctions or muscle cells. PXT3003 has shown promising and consistent results across preclinical and clinical studies in Phase II and Phase III (PLEO-CMT and PLEO-CMT-FU). More information can be found here.About PharnextPharnext is an advanced clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapies for neurodegenerative diseases currently without satisfactory therapeutic solutions. Pharnext has a first-in-class drug candidate  PXT3003  in development for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A)  a rare  debilitating  inherited peripheral neuropathy. PXT3003 benefits from orphan drug status in Europe and the United States. In 2018  PXT3003 completed a Phase III clinical trial  the PLEO-CMT trial  with encouraging topline results. This trial was followed by an open-label extension study  the PLEO-CMT-FU trial  with 120 patients continuing treatment with PXT3003. Long-term data suggests a sustained benefit  safety  and efficacy  after 5 years of total trial time. An international pivotal Phase III study of PXT3003  the PREMIER trial  is currently ongoing with 387 CMT1A patients enrolled. PREMIER topline results are expected in Q4 2023. PXT3003 originated from the Pleotherapy™ R&D approach. Pharnext draws the attention of investors to the financial and other risk factors detailed in its financial reports.

Other activities  including service revenues (information sales  debt collection and fee and commission income) continued to grow double digits  once again proving the solidity of Coface's business model.While helping moderate inflation  ongoing monetary tightening by the main central banks also revealed weaknesses in a financial system that had become accustomed to very low rates. Fears arising from the bankruptcies of US regional banks will likely lead to a general reduction in the corporate credit supply.The first quarter of 2023 is also the first to which the IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 accounting standards were applied. These standards did not cause any major changes to the assessment of Coface's financial performance  which remains strong. Under this new accounting framework  Coface posted a 17% increase in net income to €61.2m and a net combined ratio of 66.3% for an annualised return on tangible equity of 13.6%  above mid-cycle targets.Lastly  following the general meeting of 16 May  a dividend of €1.52 per share (which corresponds to 80% of our 2022 earnings) was paid on 24 May 2023.”Key figures at 31 March 2023The Board of Directors of COFACE SA examined the summary consolidated financial statements for the first three months (non-audited) during its meeting on 25 may 2023.

TurnoverCoface recorded a consolidated turnover of €475.1m  up 11.4% at constant perimeter and FX compared to Q1- 22. As reported (at current FX and perimeter)  turnover rose +11.0%.Turnover from the insurance business (including surety bonds and single risk) increased +10.9% at constant perimeter and FX. Growth benefited from a sharp increase in customer activity as well as a record retention level of 95.7%  up +0.9% compared to Q1-22. New business totalled €32m  down €3m compared to Q1-22 in an increasingly competitive market and approaching pre-COVID levels.The growth in Coface’s client activity had a positive impact of +2.0% during Q1-23. This increase continues to reflect the scale of the recent economic recovery and inflation  but the pace of growth is now slowing (-2.4 ppts compared to Q1-22). The price effect remained negative at -1.5% in Q1-23 but improved compared to Q1-22 (- 2.7%). This decrease is largely explained by a very low past claims experience and moderated by the continued normalisation of the risk environment.Turnover from non-insurance activities was up +15.3% compared to Q1-22. All the business lines are experiencing positive trends but at different scales. Turnover from factoring rose +13.1%  mainly due to the increase in volumes refinanced in Germany. Information services turnover rose +15.0%  maintaining its growth trend. Fee and commission income (debt collection commissions) increased +44.1% due to the increase in claims to be collected.

Turnover from factoring and services increased +15.5% and +44.6% respectively.In Western Europe  turnover was up +21.8% at constant FX (+21.1% at current FX) due to a high retention rate and client activity.In Central and Eastern Europe  turnover decreased by -4.6% and -4.1% at current FX due to reduced exposure to Russia and the decline in metal prices. Excluding Russia  growth would be 1%. Factoring turnover increased by +2.0%.In the Mediterranean and Africa region  which is driven by Italy and Spain  turnover rose +17.2% and +14.9% at current FX due to a high retention rate and client activity.

The slip in turnover was mainly a result of the decline in activity due to exposure to the information technology sector.2. ResultCombined ratioThe combined ratio net of reinsurance stood at 66.2% for Q1-23 (an improvement of 1.8 ppt year on year and 7.2 ppts compared to the previous quarter). This ratio was up 10.3 ppts compared to Q1-22  excluding the effect of the government schemes.(i) Loss ratioThe gross loss ratio stood at 40.7%  up 9.2 ppts year on year. This reflects an increased claims frequency since H1-21  with the number of claims close to pre-COVID levels  and the return of relatively large claims  which nevertheless remain below average. Reserve releases remain high.The Group’s reserving policy remains unchanged. The amount of provisions relating to the underwriting year  although discounted  remains in line with the historical average. The rigorous management of past claims enabled the Group to record 35.6 ppts of recoveries on previous years. Releases from previous years no longer benefited as much from COVID-related reserves.The net loss ratio rose to 40.6%  an increase of 0.3 ppt compared to T1-22 (and up 10.7 ppts compared to Q1-22  excluding the impact of government schemes).(ii) Cost ratioCoface follows a strict cost management policy. In Q1-23  costs rose by +10.9% at constant perimeter and FX  and +10.7% at current FX. Credit insurance costs were up 7.9%  which was less than the increase in turnover  demonstrating good operating leverage. The cost ratio before reinsurance stood at 29.4%  down 1.2 ppt year on year due to an improvement in the product mix (commissions).The cost ratio net of reinsurance was 25.7% in Q1-23  an improvement of 2.1 ppts year on year.Financial resultNet financial income for the first quarter was -€2.6m. This amount includes market value adjustments particularly on real estate funds for -€12m  positive hedging results and a currency effect of -€6.3m  which is mainly due to the application of IAS 29 (hyperinflation) in Argentina and Turkey.The portfolio’s current yield (i.e. excluding capital gains  impairment and currency effects) was €14.6m  i.e. a two-fold increase year on year. The accounting yield4  excluding capital gains and fair value effect  was 0.5% in Q1-23. The return on new investments remained above 2%.Operating income and net incomeOperating income for Q1-23 was €90.0m  up 11.4% year on year  mainly due to increased turnover and a loss experience that remained low.The effective tax rate was 25%  compared to 31% for Q1-22.In total  net income (group share) stood at €61.2m  up 17.0% compared to Q1-22.3. Shareholders’ equityAt 31 March 2023  Group shareholders’ equity stood at €2 100.4m  up €81.8m  i.e. +4.1% (compared to €2 018.6m at 31 December 2022).This change is mainly due to positive net income of €61.2m  and positive adjustments to the fair value of investments (€24.2m).The annualised return on average tangible equity (RoATE) was 13.6% in Q1-23.4. OutlookAs expected  inflation continued to decline due to the fall in commodity prices (particularly energy prices) and the proactive measures taken by central banks. The many monetary tightening measures in the main economic hubs have started making their impact. However  the excellent state of the labour market limited the negative consequences of this new policy. The transmission of monetary policies to the economy is not immediate and its full effect has yet to be observed.One of the most visible consequences of this tightening was the bankruptcy of a number of US banks due to a lack of supervision and regulation. At this stage  the takeover of these banks by stronger players has limited contagion. However  the other regional banks are encouraged to reduce their commitments  which could lead to a contraction in the credit supply available to households and businesses.Against this backdrop  the number of corporate bankruptcies continued to rise  albeit at a more moderate pace than expected.Lower inflation has led to slowed growth in trade credit insurance turnover. On the other hand  other activities and in particular service revenues (information  debt collection and fee and commission income) continued to grow in double digits  improving Coface's product mix.Conference call for financial analystsCoface’s results for 3M-2023 will be discussed with financial analysts during the conference call on Thursday 25 May at 18.00 (Paris time).

Other activities  including service revenues (information sales  debt collection and fee and commission income) continued to grow double digits  once again proving the solidity of Coface's business model.While helping moderate inflation  ongoing monetary tightening by the main central banks also revealed weaknesses in a financial system that had become accustomed to very low rates. Fears arising from the bankruptcies of US regional banks will likely lead to a general reduction in the corporate credit supply.The first quarter of 2023 is also the first to which the IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 accounting standards were applied. These standards did not cause any major changes to the assessment of Coface's financial performance  which remains strong. Under this new accounting framework  Coface posted a 17% increase in net income to €61.2m and a net combined ratio of 66.3% for an annualised return on tangible equity of 13.6%  above mid-cycle targets.Lastly  following the general meeting of 16 May  a dividend of €1.52 per share (which corresponds to 80% of our 2022 earnings) was paid on 24 May 2023.”Key figures at 31 March 2023The Board of Directors of COFACE SA examined the summary consolidated financial statements for the first three months (non-audited) during its meeting on 25 may 2023.

TurnoverCoface recorded a consolidated turnover of €475.1m  up 11.4% at constant perimeter and FX compared to Q1- 22. As reported (at current FX and perimeter)  turnover rose +11.0%.Turnover from the insurance business (including surety bonds and single risk) increased +10.9% at constant perimeter and FX. Growth benefited from a sharp increase in customer activity as well as a record retention level of 95.7%  up +0.9% compared to Q1-22. New business totalled €32m  down €3m compared to Q1-22 in an increasingly competitive market and approaching pre-COVID levels.The growth in Coface’s client activity had a positive impact of +2.0% during Q1-23. This increase continues to reflect the scale of the recent economic recovery and inflation  but the pace of growth is now slowing (-2.4 ppts compared to Q1-22). The price effect remained negative at -1.5% in Q1-23 but improved compared to Q1-22 (- 2.7%). This decrease is largely explained by a very low past claims experience and moderated by the continued normalisation of the risk environment.Turnover from non-insurance activities was up +15.3% compared to Q1-22. All the business lines are experiencing positive trends but at different scales. Turnover from factoring rose +13.1%  mainly due to the increase in volumes refinanced in Germany. Information services turnover rose +15.0%  maintaining its growth trend. Fee and commission income (debt collection commissions) increased +44.1% due to the increase in claims to be collected. Commissions were up +12.8%.Total revenue - in €m(by country of invoicing) Q1-22 Q1-23 Variation % ex.

Credit insurance benefited from client activity  despite the decrease in metal prices  and from a high retention rate. Turnover from factoring and services increased +15.5% and +44.6% respectively.In Western Europe  turnover was up +21.8% at constant FX (+21.1% at current FX) due to a high retention rate and client activity.In Central and Eastern Europe  turnover decreased by -4.6% and -4.1% at current FX due to reduced exposure to Russia and the decline in metal prices. Excluding Russia  growth would be 1%. Factoring turnover increased by +2.0%.In the Mediterranean and Africa region  which is driven by Italy and Spain  turnover rose +17.2% and +14.9% at current FX due to a high retention rate and client activity. Commissions climbed by +20.8%.In North America  turnover increased +11.9% at constant FX and +15.8% as reported  driven mainly by improved retention.In Latin America  turnover was up +20.3% at constant FX and +15.5% at current FX  driven by high retention and the increase in client activityIn Asia-Pacific  turnover fell -6.6% at constant FX and -5.5% at current FX. The slip in turnover was mainly a result of the decline in activity due to exposure to the information technology sector.2. ResultCombined ratioThe combined ratio net of reinsurance stood at 66.2% for Q1-23 (an improvement of 1.8 ppt year on year and 7.2 ppts compared to the previous quarter). This ratio was up 10.3 ppts compared to Q1-22  excluding the effect of the government schemes.(i) Loss ratioThe gross loss ratio stood at 40.7%  up 9.2 ppts year on year. This reflects an increased claims frequency since H1-21  with the number of claims close to pre-COVID levels  and the return of relatively large claims  which nevertheless remain below average. Reserve releases remain high.The Group’s reserving policy remains unchanged. The amount of provisions relating to the underwriting year  although discounted  remains in line with the historical average. The rigorous management of past claims enabled the Group to record 35.6 ppts of recoveries on previous years. Releases from previous years no longer benefited as much from COVID-related reserves.The net loss ratio rose to 40.6%  an increase of 0.3 ppt compared to T1-22 (and up 10.7 ppts compared to Q1-22  excluding the impact of government schemes).(ii) Cost ratioCoface follows a strict cost management policy. In Q1-23  costs rose by +10.9% at constant perimeter and FX  and +10.7% at current FX. Credit insurance costs were up 7.9%  which was less than the increase in turnover  demonstrating good operating leverage. The cost ratio before reinsurance stood at 29.4%  down 1.2 ppt year on year due to an improvement in the product mix (commissions).The cost ratio net of reinsurance was 25.7% in Q1-23  an improvement of 2.1 ppts year on year.Financial resultNet financial income for the first quarter was -€2.6m. This amount includes market value adjustments particularly on real estate funds for -€12m  positive hedging results and a currency effect of -€6.3m  which is mainly due to the application of IAS 29 (hyperinflation) in Argentina and Turkey.The portfolio’s current yield (i.e. excluding capital gains  impairment and currency effects) was €14.6m  i.e. a two-fold increase year on year. The accounting yield4  excluding capital gains and fair value effect  was 0.5% in Q1-23. The return on new investments remained above 2%.Operating income and net incomeOperating income for Q1-23 was €90.0m  up 11.4% year on year  mainly due to increased turnover and a loss experience that remained low.The effective tax rate was 25%  compared to 31% for Q1-22.In total  net income (group share) stood at €61.2m  up 17.0% compared to Q1-22.3. Shareholders’ equityAt 31 March 2023  Group shareholders’ equity stood at €2 100.4m  up €81.8m  i.e. +4.1% (compared to €2 018.6m at 31 December 2022).This change is mainly due to positive net income of €61.2m  and positive adjustments to the fair value of investments (€24.2m).The annualised return on average tangible equity (RoATE) was 13.6% in Q1-23.4. OutlookAs expected  inflation continued to decline due to the fall in commodity prices (particularly energy prices) and the proactive measures taken by central banks. The many monetary tightening measures in the main economic hubs have started making their impact. However  the excellent state of the labour market limited the negative consequences of this new policy. The transmission of monetary policies to the economy is not immediate and its full effect has yet to be observed.One of the most visible consequences of this tightening was the bankruptcy of a number of US banks due to a lack of supervision and regulation. At this stage  the takeover of these banks by stronger players has limited contagion. However  the other regional banks are encouraged to reduce their commitments  which could lead to a contraction in the credit supply available to households and businesses.Against this backdrop  the number of corporate bankruptcies continued to rise  albeit at a more moderate pace than expected.Lower inflation has led to slowed growth in trade credit insurance turnover. On the other hand  other activities and in particular service revenues (information  debt collection and fee and commission income) continued to grow in double digits  improving Coface's product mix.Conference call for financial analystsCoface’s results for 3M-2023 will be discussed with financial analysts during the conference call on Thursday 25 May at 18.00 (Paris time).

CHAIRMAN’S COMMENTARY Dear Shareholder  During the past year  the world has seen rapidly increasing interest rates and rising inflation followed by significant issues in the banking sector in both the United States and Europe. Combined with recessionary fears in some of the larger economies  and generally less capital available for investments  these events have resulted in creating further uncertainty in global financial markets  the extent and impact of which remains uncertain. Overview During the year  Reinet completed its fifth share buyback programme with 2 325 979 ordinary shares being repurchased for some € 45 million during April and May 2022. Since November 2018  a total of 14 151 395 ordinary shares have been repurchased under five share buyback programmes. The cost of the ordinary shares repurchased amounts to € 222 million  plus transaction costs; an average cost of € 15.69 per share. With a net asset value of € 31.46 per share  the share buyback programmes have immediately created value for shareholders. At the annual general meeting in August 2022  shareholders renewed their approval for Reinet to buy back its own shares; future programmes will be considered taking into account cash resources  other commitments and market conditions. Reinet was pleased to commit $ 300 million to a new investment in tactical solutions funds managed by Coatue Management  a global investment firm focused on technology-related investment opportunities led by founder and portfolio manager Mr Philippe Laffont. Mr Laffont and Coatue have an outstanding reputation as investors in the technology space with Coatue managing some $ 42 billion in assets. I look forward to working with the team at Coatue in the years to come. Capital invested during the year amounted to some € 171 million  which was mostly in respect of funds managed by Trilantic Capital Partners  TruArc Partners and Coatue. Capital allocated to private equity partners over the last few years has resulted in the fair value of these funds  as a whole  now comprising some 20 per cent of Reinet’s net asset value. Reinet has cash resources of some € 288 million and access to the equivalent of £ 200 million in various currencies by way of additional borrowing facilities  to meet investment obligations and opportunities as they arise. Since its inception in 2008  Reinet has invested some € 3.5 billion in new investments and generated an annual return of 7.7 per cent for its investors based on the Reinet share price  with the underlying net asset value reflecting an 8.8 per cent compounded increase since March 2009. Results At 31 March 2023  Reinet’s net asset value amounted to € 5.7 billion  a decrease of € 170 million or 2.9 per cent from 31 March 2022. This primarily reflects the decrease in value of certain underlying investments; in particular the decrease in the share price of British American Tobacco over the year and the weakening of sterling against the euro; this was offset by dividend income from British American Tobacco  together with increases in the value of the fund investments in Trilantic Capital Partners and TruArc Partners. Business developments During the year  Reinet committed to invest an additional € 332 million  with € 324 million being in respect of new funds launched by Coatue  Asia Partners and Prescient  € 6 million in Pension Corporation and € 2 million in other smaller investments. Pension Corporation’s adjusted own funds remained stable at £ 5.9 billion  premiums were lower than the previous year reflecting in part the impact of higher interest rates  however profits increased and the balance sheet and solvency position remained strong. In February 2023  Pension Corporation announced that it had concluded a buy-in with the Trustees of two schemes sponsored by RSA Group  insuring in total some £ 6.5 billion of liabilities and covering the pensions of 40 000 members. This is the largest ever UK bulk annuity transaction and paves the way for other large transactions. The Board of Pension Corporation proposed an inaugural dividend of 7.5 pence per ordinary share which was paid to shareholders in May 2023. Reinet’s share of this dividend amounts to some £ 49.5 million. The investment in British American Tobacco decreased in value in the year due to its share price decreasing from £ 31.94 at 31 March 2022 to £ 28.41 at 31 March 2023. At the British American Tobacco annual general meeting in April 2023  shareholders approved a dividend increase of 6 per cent to £ 2.31 per share  up from £ 2.18 per share in 2022. British American Tobacco delivered strong results in 2022 and continues to follow its strategic path to ‘A Better Tomorrow’. With the appointment of Mr Tadeu Marroco as the new CEO in May 2023  British American Tobacco continues to build on its commitment to deliver long-term sustainable value for its shareholders. The value of investments in Reinet’s private equity partners increased by some 26 per cent in the year to € 1 138 million; capital invested amounted to some € 167 million  distributions to some € 56 million  realised gains to some € 25 million and fair value increases to some € 96 million. The underlying investments are mainly in the United States and Asia where financial markets have not performed well  however our partners have been successful at adding value in these challenging times. Dividend The Board of Directors of Reinet Investments Manager S.A. proposes a dividend of € 0.30 per share  payable in September 2023. This represents a 7 per cent increase from last year. Board of Overseers Mr Ian Whitecourt passed away in November 2022; Ian was a former Senior Partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers in Luxembourg and served on Reinet’s Board of Overseers from September 2009 to December 2014. Ian brought his considerable experience of the financial world to Reinet  in particular in the Luxembourg banking and investment fund areas. Outlook With continued high interest rates  elevated inflation  the ongoing Ukraine crisis  and instability in the global financial system the world economic growth forecast is on the decline with greater volatility expected. The additional financial sector stresses are already causing a noticeable slowdown in growth with inflation not expected to reach central bank target levels for some time to come. The global banking sector has faced considerable disruption in recent months; while neither Reinet nor its underlying investments have been significantly impacted  ongoing vigilance and reviews of banking relationships are essential. Similarly  Reinet continues to monitor the situation in Russia and Ukraine; and whilst there is no direct exposure  it considers any potential impacts on investment values. Overall  Reinet holds resilient investments and is well positioned to deal with these challenges. Environmental  Social and Corporate Governance and Corporate Social Responsibility will play an ever increasing part in our lives in the future  with enhanced ESG reporting on our door step  it continues to be an integral factor when considering new investments. Reinet considers it imperative for businesses to work responsibly  recognising that the world’s resources are finite and that everyone has a role to play in their conservation. As always  I am grateful to Reinet’s Directors  Overseers  management and employees for their continued commitment to Reinet over the past year and going forward.

Calculated using actual foreign exchange rates at transaction date. Total of realised proceeds and current fair value. The invested amount for Trilantic Capital Partners includes an initial payment of $ 10 million. PERFORMANCENET ASSET VALUE The NAV comprises total assets less total liabilities  and equates to total equity under International Financial Reporting Standards. The decrease in the NAV of € 170 million during the year reflects decreases in the fair value of British American Tobacco p.l.c. (‘BAT’)  Pension Insurance Corporation Group Limited  and other listed investments  offset by dividends received from BAT together with realised gains and increases in the estimated fair value of certain investments including  Trilantic Capital Partners and TruArc Partners. The Company funded the purchase of 2.3 million of its own ordinary shares through an approved buyback programme  the amount of which was already accrued at 31 March 2022. Details of the Company’s NAV and details of movements in key investments can be found on pages 4 and 5 of this report. Reinet records its assets and liabilities in euro; the weakening of sterling against the euro  offset by the strengthening of the US dollar against the euro has resulted in an overall decrease in the value of certain assets and liabilities in euro terms. Applying current year-end exchange rates to the March 2022 assets and liabilities would have resulted in a decrease in the March 2022 NAV of some € 174 million. SHARE BUYBACK PROGRAMME The fifth share buyback programme commenced in March 2022 and concluded on 23 May 2022  with 2 500 000 ordinary shares repurchased for € 49 million  plus transaction costs. During the year under review  2 325 979 ordinary shares were repurchased for some € 45 million  plus transaction costs. As at 31 March 2023  there was no share buyback programme in progress. The Company repurchased 14 151 395 ordinary shares between November 2018 and May 2022 under five share buyback programmes. The cost of the ordinary shares repurchased amounted to € 222 million  plus transaction costs. Details of each completed share buyback programme to date can be found in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. All ordinary shares repurchased are held as treasury shares. NET ASSET VALUE PER SHARE The NAV per share and the adjusted NAV per share of the Company are calculated by dividing the NAV and adjusted NAV by the number of shares outstanding (excluding treasury shares) of 181 790 891 (31 March 2022: 184 116 870). The adjusted NAV as at 31 March 2022 was calculated by reversing the liability in respect of future repurchases of shares of € 46 million. The adjusted NAV is considered relevant as it eliminates the timing difference between the additional liability recorded for future share repurchases and the actual number of shares repurchased as at 31 March 2022. No adjustment was made as at 31 March 2023 as there was no share buyback programme in progress at that date. 31 March 2023 31 March 2022 Shares in issue 195 942 286 195 942 286 Treasury shares (14 151 395) (11 825 416) Net shares 181 790 891 184 116 870 € m € m NAV (see page 4) 5 720 5 890 Reversal of future share buyback liability - 46 Adjusted NAV 5 720 5 936 € per share € per share NAV per share 31.46 31.99 Adjusted NAV per share 31.46 32.24 SHARE PRICE The Company’s indicative share price as quoted on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange decreased by 6.0 per cent in the year from € 20.00 at 31 March 2022 to € 18.80 at 31 March 2023  with the highest trade being at € 19.80 during the year. The total shareholder return since inception (taking into account the initial price of € 7.1945 and including dividends paid) is 7.7 per cent per annum. The growth in NAV  including dividends paid  reflects an 8.8 per cent compounded increase since March 2009. The Company’s ordinary shares are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange  Euronext Amsterdam and the Johannesburg Stock Exchange; the listing on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange is a secondary listing. Share prices as at 31 March 2023 and 31 March 2022 were as follows: 31 March 2023 31 March 2022 ZAR EUR ZAR EUR Luxembourg - 18.80 - 20.00 Amsterdam - 19.00 - 20.00 Johannesburg 365.06 - 327.76 - GLOBAL MARKETS BACKDROP During the year  global markets continued to be impacted by the effects of the ongoing Ukraine crisis  increasing interest rates and rising inflation. Whilst the world has made significant progress in its recovery from the impacts of COVID-19  general economic and geopolitical concerns remain elevated. The first quarter of 2023 saw increased market volatility as the collapse of US lender Silicon Valley Bank triggered concerns over the strength of the global financial sector; this was followed by UBS stepping in to take over Credit Suisse to prevent its collapse and JPMorgan Chase acquiring a substantial majority of assets and assuming the deposits and certain liabilities of First Republic Bank. These events resulted in creating further uncertainty in global financial markets. Rising inflation has resulted in significant pressure on households and consumers as many central banks continue to increase interest rates to mitigate the inflation concerns. The extent and impact of these factors remain uncertain. Reinet has no direct exposure to Russia or Ukraine through its underlying investments or banking relationships and has not experienced any significant direct impacts in respect of interest rate increases or rising inflation. Reinet has various banking relationships with highly rated institutions  and a well-diversified approach to cash and liquidity management. Reinet continues to value its investments in line with the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation (‘IPEV’) guidelines and its approved valuation procedures and methodologies. All investment valuations have been prepared using latest available data  including exchange rates and listed share prices as at 31 March 2023. Discussions have taken place with fund managers and investee companies to determine any significant changes in value and any impacts related to the Ukraine crisis  volatility in stock and currency markets  interest rates  inflation and exposure to certain financial institutions. Future valuations will take into account any new impacts of the above  which could affect the valuation of underlying investments. INVESTMENTS Reinet seeks  through a range of investment structures  to build partnerships with other investors  specialised fund managers and entrepreneurs to find and develop opportunities for long-term value creation for its shareholders. Since its formation in 2008  Reinet has invested some € 3.5 billion and at 31 March 2023 committed to provide further funding of € 627 million to its current investments. Details of the funding commitments outstanding are given in the table on page 16 of this report. New commitments during the year under review amounted to € 332 million  and a total of € 171 million was funded during the year. LISTED INVESTMENTS BRITISH AMERICAN TOBACCO P.L.C. The investment in BAT remains one of Reinet’s largest investments and is kept under constant review  considering the company’s performance  the industry outlook  cash flows from dividends  stock market performance  volatility and liquidity. Luc Jobin  Chairman  and Jack Bowles  Chief Executive  writing in the BAT annual report for 2022 commented: Luc Jobin: ‘2022 marks a year of great progress against the strategy at BAT  given the backdrop of an increasingly complex external environment. I am proud of the delivery of the business in 2022. Navigating a new economic cycle characterised by rising inflation  higher interest rates and a tight labour market  has required the business to be more adaptable than ever. Such complexities have been exacerbated by international conflict  political instability and supply chain constraints. In response  BAT has increased its focus on driving both a step change in New Categories and value from the combustibles business. Sustainability and ESG have long been an intrinsic part of BAT’s DNA. As part of our commitment to the UN-backed Race to Zero campaign  BAT published its Low-Carbon Transition Plan in 2022. This is the latest milestone in BAT’s journey to tackle climate change and to build ‘A Better Tomorrow’. Jack Bowles: ‘During 2022  the business demonstrated once again that it can transform while also delivering strong results. Revenue was up 7.7 per cent on 2021. New Categories have become a significant contributor to this  delivering £ 2 894 million in 2022 (up 40.9 per cent). We remain on track to meet our New Category revenue target of £ 5 billion by 2025  and now expect profitability by 2024  one year ahead of plan. At the centre of our strategy is our corporate purpose to build ‘A Better Tomorrow’. This means offering a greater choice of enjoyable and less risky products for our customers. 2022 shows that our strategy is working. We have strong  global New Category brands  targeted geographic expansion plans and an unwavering commitment to innovation that means we are delivering for the consumer. We have also made great progress on our existing ESG commitments this year and I was delighted with the appointment of our first Chief Sustainability Officer in August 2022 further embedding our decades-long commitment to sustainability.’ During the year under review  dividend income recorded from BAT amounted to € 122 million (£ 107 million)  being BAT’s second  third and fourth 2022 quarterly dividends  together with the first 2023 quarterly dividend of some € 31 million (£ 28 million) with a record date of 24 March 2023. The first 2023 quarterly dividend was paid on 3 May 2023 and has been included as a receivable in the NAV as at 31 March 2023  due to the record date falling within the financial year. Reinet holds 48.3 million shares in BAT (31 March 2022: 48.3 million)  representing some 2.16 per cent of BAT’s issued share capital. The value of Reinet’s investment in BAT amounted to € 1 561 million at 31 March 2023 (31 March 2022: € 1 832 million)  being some 27.3 per cent of Reinet’s NAV. The decrease in value reflects the decrease in the BAT share price on the London Stock Exchange from £ 31.94 at 31 March 2022 to £ 28.41 at 31 March 2023 together with the weakening of sterling against the euro during the year.

PENSION INSURANCE CORPORATION GROUP LIMITED Pension Insurance Corporation Group Limited’s (‘Pension Corporation’) wholly-owned subsidiary  Pension Insurance Corporation plc (‘Pension Insurance Corporation’)  is a leading provider in the UK pension risk transfer market. During 2022  Pension Insurance Corporation concluded new business with premiums of £ 4.1 billion (2021: £ 4.7 billion) including for long-term clients IMI and British American Tobacco. The reduction in premium levels reflecting in part the impact of higher interest rates. At 31 December 2022  Pension Insurance Corporation reported it held £ 41.0 billion in assets (31 December 2021: £ 51.1 billion). The decrease in value is due to rising yields which lead to lower asset values and also to lower liability values. As at 31 December 2022  insurance liabilities declined to £ 33.0 billion (FY2021: £47.0 billion). To date  Pension Insurance Corporation has insured 302 200 pension fund members (31 December 2021: 282 900). Clients include FTSE 100 companies  multinationals and the public sector. Pension Insurance Corporation has a total of £ 1.6 billion Tier 2 subordinated notes and £ 450 million Tier 1 restricted notes outstanding. In March 2023  Fitch affirmed its Insurer Financial Strength rating at A+ (Strong) and Long-Term Issuer Default rating at A. The reported Solvency II capital ratio as at 31 December 2022 was 225 per cent (31 December 2021: 168 per cent). The Board of Pension Corporation proposed an inaugural dividend for 2022 of 7.50 pence per ordinary share (2021: nil). The dividend was paid on 10 May 2023. Reinet has not recorded a receivable as at 31 March 2023  as the approval date falls outside this financial year. Reinet’s shareholding in Pension Corporation increased from 49.4 per cent at 31 March 2022 to 49.5 per cent at 31 March 2023 as a result of a secondary share purchase transaction in the amount of some £ 4.8 million. Tracy Blackwell  Chief Executive Officer and Dom Veney  Chief Financial Officer of Pension Insurance Corporation  commented: Tracy Blackwell: ‘We ended the year with a robust balance sheet  very high customer satisfaction levels  and a huge market opportunity before us. Our purpose  which is to pay the pensions of our current and future policyholders  ensures that we always protect our balance sheet and prioritise risk management  as well as helping us evolve our investment strategy as we seek cash flows to match future pension payments  which stretch decades into the future. As a business with a very long-term outlook  we seek to develop ongoing relationships with our clients and investment partners  a theme which is noticeable in this year’s results. The scale of our investments mean that we are increasingly being recognised for our growing impact across the country  and the social value these investments generate. In February 2023 we announced the largest bulk annuity transaction to date. The deal was driven by the rise in gilt yields during 2022. During the first half of the year this meant that defined benefit pension schemes were becoming better funded and closer to being able to buy out even before the Liability Driven Investment crisis. However  the rapid increase in yields following the ‘mini-budget’  even where they fell back somewhat in the following weeks  had the overall effect of significantly reducing scheme deficits  bringing forward by several years trustees’ de-risking plans. This has resulted in an exciting pipeline of new business for 2023 and beyond.’ Dom Veney: ‘IFRS profit before tax of £ 1 240 million (2021: £ 393 million) benefitted from favourable investment variances. Our hedging strategy is primarily calibrated to stabilise our solvency position rather than the IFRS balance sheet. This better reflects how we manage the business but can cause short-term volatility within the IFRS results. Operating profit remained strong at £ 388 million (2021: £ 533 million). Underlying profit grew by 44 per cent to £ 654 million (2021: £ 455 million) from higher returns on surplus assets and new business profits  but this was more than offset by £ 315 million of favourable assumption changes which increased AOPBT in 2021 but which were not repeated in 2022. Looking ahead  while the volatile market conditions and evolving regulatory environment are expected to persist in the short-term  our disciplined approach to underwriting  prudent investment strategy and robust financial position mean that we are well positioned for the upcoming market opportunities. We have made a strong start to 2023  having recently completed the UK’s single largest pension risk transfer deal to date for estimated premiums of £ 6.5 billion. Following full implementation of the transaction  PIC’s long-term solvency ratio would remain above 200 per cent  based on economic conditions at 31 December 2022.’ Reinet’s investment in Pension Corporation is carried at an estimated fair value of € 2 787 million at 31 March 2023 (31 March 2022: € 2 796 million). This value takes into account Pension Corporation’s audited adjusted equity own funds value at 31 December 2022 of £ 5.9 billion (31 December 2021: £ 5.9 billion)  corresponding valuation multiples drawn from industry data for a selected UK insurance peer group as at 31 March 2023  and a discount of 10 per cent which takes into account the illiquid nature of Reinet’s investment. The decrease in Reinet’s estimated fair value of Pension Corporation over the year is mainly due to the of weakening of sterling against the euro in the year  most of which was offset by an increase in comparable company multiples derived from public information of listed peer group companies in the UK insurance sector. The investment in Pension Corporation represents some 48.7 per cent of Reinet’s NAV at 31 March 2023  compared to 47.5 per cent at 31 March 2022. On 27 February 2023  Pension Corporation announced that it had concluded a buy-in with the Trustees of two schemes sponsored by RSA Group  insuring in total some £ 6.5 billion of liabilities and covering the pensions of 40 000 members. RSA Group is a wholly owned subsidiary of Intact Financial Corporation. This is the largest ever UK bulk annuity transaction and paves the way for other large transactions as part of the anticipated increase in volumes of new business coming to market. Further information on Pension Corporation is available at www.pensioncorporation.com. PRIVATE EQUITY AND RELATED PARTNERSHIPS Where Reinet invests in funds managed by third parties its philosophy is to partner with the managers of such funds and to share in fees generated by funds under management. This is the case with funds managed by Trilantic Capital Partners  TruArc Partners  Milestone Capital and Prescient Investment Management China. Under the terms of the investment advisory agreement (the ‘Investment Advisory Agreement’)  entered into by the Fund Manager and Reinet Investment Advisors Limited (the ‘Investment Advisor’)  Reinet pays no management fee to the Investment Advisor on such investments except in the case where no fee or a reduced fee below 1 per cent is paid to the third-party manager. In such cases  the aggregate fee payable to the Investment Advisor and the third-party manager is capped at 1 per cent. TRILANTIC CAPITAL PARTNERS TRILANTIC CAPITAL PARTNERS Trilantic Capital Partners (‘Trilantic’) is composed of Trilantic North America and Trilantic Europe  two separate and independent private equity investment advisors focused on making controlling and significant minority interest investments in companies in their respective geographies. Trilantic North America currently targets investments in the business services and consumer sectors  and currently manages five fund families. Trilantic Europe primarily targets investments in the industrials  consumer and leisure  telecommunication  media and technology  business services and healthcare sectors  and currently manages three fund families. Reinet and its minority partner invest in certain of the Trilantic general partnerships and management companies (together ‘Trilantic Management’). Reinet and its minority partner  through Reinet TCP Holdings Limited  invest in two of the current funds under Trilantic’s management. Reinet also directly invests in four additional funds under Trilantic’s management. The terms of investment applicable to Reinet’s investment in the Trilantic funds provide that Reinet will not pay any management fees or carried interest. In addition  Reinet receives a share of the carried interest payable on the realisation of investments held in the funds  once a hurdle rate has been achieved. Reinet TCP Holdings Limited invests in Trilantic Capital Partners IV L.P. (‘Fund IV’) and Trilantic Capital Partners IV (Europe) L.P.; these funds are in the process of realising the remaining underlying investments. In 2012  Reinet invested in Trilantic Capital Partners V (North America) L.P. (‘Fund V’) and in 2014  in Trilantic Energy Partners (North America) L.P. (‘TEP I’). These US-based funds are focused on North American opportunities with TEP I being especially focused on the energy industry sector. Both funds are in the process of realising the remaining underlying investments. In 2017  Reinet invested in Trilantic Capital Partners VI Parallel (North America) L.P. (collectively with its parallel vehicles  ‘Fund VI’) and Trilantic Energy Partners II Parallel (North America) L.P. (collectively with its parallel vehicles ‘TEP II’). These US-based funds are focused on North American opportunities with TEP II being especially focused on the energy industry sector. Charlie Ayres  Chairman of Trilantic North America and the Executive Committee of Trilantic Capital Partners  commented: ‘2022 was a difficult year for financial assets  with ‘worst performance since 2008’ pervasive in describing performance. Many (former) technology darlings lost significant value. The Nasdaq fell 33 per cent on the year  outpacing losses in the S&P 500 Index and Dow Jones Industrial Average  down 19 per cent and 9 per cent  respectively. Risk appetite has not completely dried up in the face of uncertainty and volatility. Trends in earnings and future guidance  as well as messaging from the Fed  will likely shape public market performance over the coming months. Despite significant losses in public markets in 2022  many private equity valuations have not yet experienced significant markdowns. Our active companies remain under-levered with healthy balance sheets and we continue to focus on finding asymmetric risk / reward opportunities to deploy capital. Key highlights from the past year include: Completed 5 significant realisations with total proceeds of $ 762 million Fund VI North America deployed $ 212 million into 2 new platform investments Experienced aggregate portfolio accretion of $ 878 million during 2022 Continued to source attractive add-on investments for our platform companies.We are on track to publish our 3rd Annual ESG Report in May 2023; this report will provide an update on our progress both within the Firm and within our portfolio  where we have focused on key KPIs  influenced by ILPA’s ESG Convergence project; we are proud to be signatories to both the U.N. Principals for Responsible Investing and ILPA’s diversity in action initiative. Key 2023 objectives: We aim to monetize 1 to 3 of our current investments during 2023  subject to market conditions. We remain focused on finding 2 to 5 new investment opportunities per year at a typical equity check size of $ 100 million to $ 300 million.’ Trilantic North America launched Trilantic Capital Partners VII Parallel (North America) L.P. (collectively with its parallel vehicles  ‘Fund VII’) as a successor fund to Fund IV  Fund V and Fund VI  and Reinet committed to invest up to 9.9 per cent of total commitments in Fund VII  with an expected final commitment of some $ 297 million. In April 2022  Fund VII held its first closing; however  it has not called capital to date. Trilantic North America recently announced that Fund VII is now expected to be a smaller bridge fund to Fund VIII. In light of this  Reinet and Trilantic North America agreed that Reinet would not commit capital to Fund VII  however  Reinet would retain its rights to invest on preferential terms in future funds. Vittorio Pignatti-Morano  Chairman of Trilantic Europe  commented: ‘2022 was the 15th year of Trilantic Europe as an independent company and it was a year of change. A dramatic and unexpected full-scale European conflict  the Russian invasion of Ukraine  created a worldwide escalation of gas and oil prices. The resulting inflationary pressure on energy was additive to the embedded ‘COVID-19 exit’ inflationary pressure arising from the prior two years of extensive government subsidies to individuals and companies. It’s not clear for how long this period of higher interest rates and higher inflation will last but it will be years not months. For the USA and Europe  2022 crystallised the end of two decades of growing global trade which were a great deflator for the western economies which  by outsourcing production to lower-cost emerging economies  were importing cheaper goods and services. Although already seeing reduced inflation  all this represents a paradigm change for the world of investments in general and for private equity in particular. At Trilantic Europe we are dealing with these changes. We have analysed in depth our existing portfolio  the skills that our portfolio managers need  the new investments we should consider and those we should de-emphasise. Our ESG focus that has been at the forefront of our investing for over a decade  is now better channelled into our portfolio companies  making the impact much greater.’ Reinet’s investment in Trilantic Management and the above funds is carried at the estimated fair value of € 472 million at 31 March 2023 (31 March 2022: € 385 million) of which € 2 million (31 March 2022: € 2 million) is attributable to the minority partner. The estimated fair value is based on audited valuation data provided by Trilantic Management at 31 December 2022 adjusted for changes in the value of listed investments included in the portfolios and cash movements up to 31 March 2023. The increase in the estimated fair value reflects capital contributions of € 22 million and increases in estimated fair values of underlying investments together with the strengthening of the US dollar against the euro in the year  offset by distributions of € 44 million. During the year under review  gains of € 21 million (31 March 2022: € 6 million) and carried interest of € 6 million (31 March 2022: € 8 million) were realised.

Reinet is invested in Snow Phipps II  Snow Phipps III  TruArc Fund IV  in two co-investment opportunities alongside Snow Phipps III  and in the management company. Ogden Phipps  Co-Managing Partner of TruArc Partners  commented: ‘2022 was a year of continued positive momentum for TruArc. We completed the acquisition of two new platform companies in Fund IV  bringing the total to five platform companies in that fund. Each company fits well within TruArc’s transformational growth approach  and multiple growth initiatives are well underway. A key component of our investment approach is to execute a ‘buy and build’ value creation strategy  and during 2022 we completed 20 strategically important and financially accretive add-on acquisitions across the TruArc-managed portfolio companies. TruArc’s active  operational approach has allowed us to strengthen our portfolio company positions in their respective markets despite the dynamic operating environment driven by supply chain issues  labour challenges  inflation  and rising interest rates. Despite the continued market turbulence and challenging operating environment  we are encouraged by how well our management teams are effectively leading our portfolio companies as they navigate these evolving markets and execute their growth initiatives. We are working closely with our management teams to build value through transformational growth across the TruArc portfolio.’ Reinet’s investment is carried at an estimated fair value of € 301 million at 31 March 2023 (31 March 2022: € 202 million)  based on the audited valuation data provided by TruArc at 31 December 2022 adjusted for cash movements up to 31 March 2023. The increase in the estimated fair value reflects capital contributions of € 66 million  increases in estimated fair values of underlying investments together with the strengthening of the US dollar against the euro in the year  offset by distributions of € 3 million. During the year under review  gains of € 1 million (31 March 2022: € 123 million) were realised. Further information on TruArc Partners is available at www.truarcpartners.com. COATUE FUNDS Coatue Management L.L.C. (‘Coatue’) is a global investment firm focused on technology-related investment opportunities led by founder  Mr Philippe Laffont. Coatue invests in public and private markets with a focus on technology  media  telecommunications  the consumer and healthcare sectors. Coatue manages some $ 42 billion in assets on behalf of individuals  endowments  foundations  pension plans  sovereign wealth funds  insurance companies and other institutional investors and has offices in New York  San Francisco  London  Shanghai and Hong Kong. In October 2022  Reinet committed a total of € 278 million ($ 300 million) to two funds managed by Coatue Management L.L.C.  € 139 million ($ 150 million) to Coatue Structured Offshore Feeder Fund LP and € 139 million ($ 150 million) to Coatue Tactical Solutions CT Offshore Fund B LP (together the ‘Coatue Structured Funds’). Both funds follow the same investment strategy. The Coatue Structured Funds will seek to invest in structured investments in both publicly listed and privately held technology companies that offer downside protection  while retaining upside potential. The Coatue Structured Funds will focus on privately negotiated transactions leveraging Coatue’s sector experience and platform resources to source proprietary transactions. Coatue will seek to employ a strategy that will opportunistically fund both offensive and defensive transactions such as M&A  and establishing paths toward accelerating organic growth  among other paths. Coatue believes there is a substantial universe of potential investment opportunities and that the market could produce significant structured capital opportunities. Coatue will typically seek to lead transactions and assert control over deal structure  terms  and price. The majority of transactions will aim to be proprietary – not through a marketed offering – and are expected to aim to avoid mark-to-market volatility. Coatue generally intends to focus on companies that are: 1) powered by a strong underlying trend; 2) established winners or breakout leaders within a category or trend; 3) pursuing a large total addressable market; 4) operating business models with strong unit economics; and 5) led by visionary founders and top-notch management teams. In the approximately nine months since launch  the Coatue Structured Funds have deployed more than $ 600 million across eight transactions. Reinet’s investment is carried at an estimated fair value of € 50 million at 31 March 2023 (31 March 2022: € nil)  based on the audited valuation data provided by Coatue at 31 December 2022 adjusted for cash movements up to 31 March 2023.

Milestone Capital has a strong track record in helping portfolio companies scale their operations and become listed on either domestic or foreign stock exchanges. Funds under management invest primarily in domestic Chinese high-growth companies seeking expansion or acquisition capital. Milestone funds seek to maximise medium to long-term capital appreciation by making direct investments to acquire minority or majority equity stakes in those companies identified by Milestone’s investment team. Current areas of investment include: domestic consumer brands  biopharmaceutical manufacturers  medical device manufacturers  big data services and e-commerce. Yunli Lou  Managing Partner of Milestone Capital  commented: ‘During 2022  Milestone Capital continued working closely with our portfolio companies to achieve exits. We continued selling down our shares in a listed cosmetics e-commerce platform  and also started the sales process of our stake in a medical consumable company. In 2022  China’s economy and social activities were negatively impacted by COVID-19. Full year GDP was $ 17.5 trillion  up by only 3.0 per cent year-on-year  while total retail sales of consumer goods posted a 0.2 per cent year-on-year decline. Capital markets performance was weak as well  impacted by the weakened economy and sentiment. Starting in November 2022 after China’s top leadership reshuffle  China relaxed its zero-COVID policy and started reopening. The number of COVID-19 infections quickly peaked in late December 2022  and since early 2023  daily life and social activities have returned to normal. The government has set a 5.0 per cent GDP growth rate target for 2023  while making economic growth the top priority in setting policies  particularly in consumption  manufacturing  and energy transition sectors.’ The investment in Milestone is held at the estimated fair value of € 44 million (31 March 2022: € 50 million) based on audited financial information provided by Milestone Capital at 31 December 2022 adjusted for movements in listed investments and cash movements up to 31 March 2023. The decrease in the estimated fair value reflects distributions of € 9 million and decreases in estimated fair values of underlying investments  offset by capital contributions of € 1 million together with the strengthening of the US dollar against the euro in the year.

Prescient China funds and management company Reinet invests in the Prescient China Equity Fund  the Prescient China Balanced Fund  the Prescient China Growth Enhanced Absolute Return Fund and the management company. The Prescient China Equity Fund uses a systematic  quantitative approach to seek long-term capital growth by investing primarily in China ‘A’ shares listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges by virtue of Prescient’s Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor status granted by the China Securities Regulatory Commission. Prescient China Balanced Fund invests in equities following a similar strategy to the Prescient China Equity Fund and also in bonds  cash and derivatives with the objective of generating inflation-beating returns at acceptable risk levels. In May 2022  Reinet committed to invest in the newly launched Prescient China Growth Enhanced Absolute Return Fund. The fund aims to achieve long-term capital growth at significantly lower return volatility than conventional multi-asset China investment strategies. The fund will predominantly invest in mainland Chinese equities  bonds  cash  money market instruments and derivatives. Reinet invested € 11 million ($ 12 million) during the year. All funds are managed by a subsidiary of Prescient Limited (‘Prescient’)  a South African fund manager  with the team based in Shanghai. Liang Du  Portfolio Manager of Prescient  commented: ‘Over the past year China faced its most challenging year yet since the Chinese financial crisis of 2015. Omicron's fast transmissibility resulted in COVID being out of control in China for the first time  COVID zero policy in major cities combined with extremely cumbersome COVID controls dramatically dampened economic activity as well as household sentiment throughout the country. The combination of COVID zero  negative sentiment would further impact the already slowing property sector  resulting in the large property developer defaults. Geopolitical concerns also remain at the forefront. All of this would result in Chinese stocks hitting the lows of 2008 levels  with low single digit PE multiples in October 2023. President Xi secured his 3rd term and  policy movement post event as well as cabinet appointments surprised many. By and large the majority of new cabinet members were technocrats and historically business friendly. As Omicron became widespread for the second time in December 2022  COVID zero policies was also abandoned extremely quickly resulting in the complete dismantling of COVID-19 policies in a few weeks. Low inflation  low interest rates as well as end of COVID zero saw a strong economic recovery in China in the first quarter of 2023.Over the past year the Prescient Funds navigated some of the most difficult financial markets well  both funds were exceedingly competitive against their respective peer group and performed very well under extremely difficult conditions  with our flagship China Balanced Fund reaching it's 10-year anniversary in March 2023. The fund is comfortably in the top decile in its category and delivered returns of 8.5 per cent annualised over the past decade. In spite of China's capital markets having a pretty tough time  the fund still delivered extremely strong real returns and almost double the return of just a passive equivalent. Our Equity Fund will see it's 5-year anniversary in October 2023  it has also beaten more than 80 per cent of its peer group since inception. We continue to follow our philosophy and process to invest in China and hope that we will deliver for clients over the next decade what we have done over the last.’ Reinet’s total investment is carried at an estimated fair value of € 143 million based on unaudited financial information provided by Prescient at 31 March 2023 (31 March 2022: € 143 million). The estimated fair value reflects capital contributions of € 11 million together with the strengthening of the US dollar against the euro in the year  offset by decreases in the value of underlying investments. Further information on Prescient is available at www.prescient.co.za. Asia Partners funds Reinet is invested in Asia Partners I LP and Asia Partners II LP. Asia Partners I LP is the inaugural fund of Asia Partners Fund Management Pte. Ltd (‘Asia Partners’)  a Singapore-based growth equity investment firm. Asia Partners II LP was launched in April 2022. Asia Partners bases its investment strategy on the long-term growth potential of Southeast Asia  the rapid growth of innovative technology and technology-enabled businesses in the region  and target investments in the $ 20 million to $ 80 million range  often described as the ‘Series C/D Gap’ between early-stage venture capital and the public capital markets. Oliver Rippel  Co-Founder and Partner of Asia Partners  commented: ‘We continue to be excited about the Southeast Asia region. Five out of the six key countries in the region outperformed US equities by at least 800 basis points in 2022. Three out of the six had higher real GDP growth than inflation in 2022. Demographics favour Southeast Asia  as well: the total population of 15 to 35-year-olds in Southeast Asia peaks after both China and India.With this macro backdrop  we have seen a significant number of next generation tech companies across the region not only scale their business  but most importantly generate strong gross profits and near-term profitability. Our objective is to support these businesses through our investment and value-add and ultimately help them transition to become sizeable public companies.’ In April 2022  Reinet committed € 30 million ($ 31 million) to Asia Partners II LP as part of the first close. This amount increased to € 35 million ($ 37 million) through December 2022 and is expected to increase further at subsequent fund closings. An initial investment of some € 7 million ($ 8 million) was made in July 2022. The investment in Asia Partners funds is held at the estimated fair value of € 32 million (31 March 2022: € 20 million) based on audited financial information provided by the fund manager at 31 December 2022 adjusted for cash movements up to 31 March 2023. The increase in the estimated fair value reflects capital contributions of € 10 million  increases in the value of underlying investments together with the strengthening of the US dollar against the euro in the year.

They invest predominantly across the United States and Europe with additional investments in Canada  Denmark and the United Kingdom. Their teams are situated in Silicon Valley  Switzerland and the Cayman Islands. Aymeric Sallin  Founder of NanoDimension  commented: ‘Whilst we presently face tough capital markets our approach to investing is long term  which requires time  effort  patience  and resilience. In some instances  following a decade of investment and support  we are excited to see certain of our portfolio companies become best in class.As the organization continues to grow  we are pleased with the sophisticated investors who have world class expertise that have invested their own capital alongside us  and who work with us regularly.As with every company  the transition from technology to market  production  and operational excellence  requires new skills. Hence  we feel very privileged to have recently attracted incredible leadership talent for several of our portfolio companies.’ Reinet is a limited partner in NanoDimension L.P.  NanoDimension II L.P.  NanoDimension III L.P.  NanoDimension IV L.P. and ND Capital Opportunity Fund I L.P.  and is invested in one co-investment opportunity alongside NanoDimension II L.P. At 31 March 2023  the estimated fair value of Reinet’s investment amounted to € 94 million (31 March 2022: € 98 million) based on audited valuation data provided by NanoDimension as at 31 December 2022 adjusted for movements in listed investments and cash movements up to 31 March 2023. The decrease in the estimated fair value reflects distributions of € 6 million together with decreases in the value of underlying investments  offset by capital contributions of € 7 million together with the strengthening of the US dollar against the euro in the year. Further information on NanoDimension is available at www.ndcapital.com. Other fund investments Other fund investments This includes small  specialist funds investing in private equity businesses and start-up ventures. Other fund investments are valued in total at their estimated fair value of € 2 million at 31 March 2023 (31 March 2022: € 8 million) based on the latest available valuation statements received from the fund managers. The decrease in the estimated fair value principally reflects decreases in the value of underlying investments. UNITED STATES LAND DEVELOPMENT AND MORTGAGES Reinet has invested in certain real estate development projects and related businesses located in the United States (including Florida  North Carolina and South Carolina). Reinet has also purchased mortgage debt associated with such developments from financial institutions  usually at significant discounts to face value. The core land development process encompasses land planning  attaining entitlements from governmental bodies and installation of community infrastructure. Other investments in mitigation banks facilitate the preservation of land to offset the loss of wetlands necessitated by public improvements  such as highway construction  and other privately-sponsored developments. Bill Lanius  Chief Executive Officer of United States land development and mortgages  commented: ‘In the past year  our industry has witnessed a moderation in housing demand caused by significant mortgage rate increases and general economic uncertainty  primarily stemming from the inflationary surge. Furthermore  lingering supply chain issues and heightened governmental regulation resulted in extended production cycles. Despite these challenges  the demographics that support long-term housing demand remain favourable  particularly in Florida and other sunbelt locations in which our portfolio of properties is concentrated. During our most recent fiscal year  the United States land development and mortgages business finalized key transactions and solidified important business relationships that will facilitate future operations. The results are consistent with our strategy of monetizing designated assets and distributing surplus capital to Reinet. Based on our progress to date  we cautiously enter the new fiscal year as a streamlined operation with greater ability to respond to changing economic circumstances.’ The investment is carried at the estimated fair value of € 26 million as at 31 March 2023 (31 March 2022: € 32 million). The current valuation is based on audited and unaudited financial statements as at 31 December 2022 adjusted for cash movements up to 31 March 2023. The decrease in the estimated fair value reflects repayments received during the year of € 11 million  offset by increases in the valuation of underlying assets together with the strengthening of the US dollar against the euro during the year. OTHER INVESTMENTS Other investments are carried at their estimated fair value of € 58 million at 31 March 2023 (31 March 2022: € 81 million). The decrease in the estimated fair value relates to decreases in the valuation of underlying investments and the weakening of sterling against the euro in the year  offset by amounts invested together with the strengthening of the US dollar against the euro in the year. COMMITTED DURING THE YEAR Commitments made in the year amounted to € 332 million  including € 278 million ($ 300 million) to Coatue funds  € 11 million ($ 12 million) to Prescient China Growth Enhanced Absolute Return Fund and € 35 million ($ 37 million) to Asia Partners II LP.

Reinet’s liquidity is measured by its ability to meet potential cash requirements  including unfunded commitments on investments and the repayment of borrowings  and at 31 March 2023 can be summarised as follows: Cash and liquid funds € 288 m Undrawn borrowing facilities € 227 m Cash required for unfunded commitments (refer to table on previous page) (€ 627 m) Cash required to meet GBP borrowing obligations (€ 227 m) The undrawn borrowing facilities comprise a revolving facility with Bank of America  N.A. and with Citibank N.A. (see below). Reinet may sell further BAT shares or use such shares to secure additional financing facilities from time to time. BANK BORROWINGS BORROWINGS BORROWINGS Reinet has a fixed-rate £ 100 million margin loan due to Citibank N.A.  which is repayable in August 2024.

In addition  Reinet has a fixed-rate £ 100 million margin loan due to Bank of America  N.A.  which is repayable in March 2025. At 31 March 2023  the estimated fair value of the loan amounted to € 109 million (31 March 2022: € 119 million). The decrease in the estimated fair value of both loans reflects the increase in the discount rates used (due to increases in market interest rates) together with the weakening of sterling in the period. Some 13.8 million BAT shares have been pledged to collateralise these two loans. In addition  Reinet has a facility agreement in place with Citibank N.A. up to August 2024 and with Bank of America  N.A. up to March 2025. These facilities allow Reinet to drawdown the equivalent of up to € 227 million (£ 200 million) in a combination of currencies to fund further investment commitments. As at 31 March 2023 no funds have been drawn under these facilities.

Stellantis Ventures  powered by an initial €300 million in funding  is a key component of the company's Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan  which sets out core targets for Stellantis  including deep emission cuts to slash CO2 in half by 2030  benchmarking the 2021 metrics  and achieving carbon net zero by 2038 with single-digit percentage compensation of the remaining emissions.""We are delighted that Stellantis Ventures  as the venture investment arm of a global automotive innovator  has demonstrated a strong belief in our company and our Lyten 3D Graphene decarbonizing supermaterials "" said Dan Cook  president and CEO of Lyten. ""Among the automotive product innovations being transformed by Lyten 3D Graphene are lithium-sulfur batteries with the potential to deliver more than twice the energy density of lithium-ion  payload-improving lightweighted vehicle composites  and new modes of sensing that do not require chips  batteries or wires. We are committed to advancing each of these applications to Stellantis and the automotive market.""Cook continued: ""Unlike two-dimensional forms of graphene  the production of our tunable Lyten 3D Graphene has been independently verified to be carbon neutral at scale. We are converting greenhouse gases into a new class of high-performance  high-value carbon materials and are incorporating these tuned materials into applications that will decarbonize the hardest to abate sectors on the planet.""""Having recently visited Lyten together with our CTO Ned Curic and our head of Stellantis Ventures Adam Bazih  we walked away impressed by the potential of this technology to help drive clean  safe and affordable mobility "" said Carlos Tavares  Stellantis CEO. ""Lyten's materials platform is a key investment for Stellantis Ventures  in line with our Dare Forward 2030 goal to accelerate deployment of innovative  customer-centric technologies. Specifically  Lyten's lithium-sulfur battery has the potential to be a key ingredient in enabling mass-market EV adoption globally  and their material technology is equally well positioned to help reduce vehicle weight  which is all necessary for our industry to achieve carbon net zero goals.""With traditional lithium-ion battery materials in critically short supply for EV manufacturing  Lyten's lithium-sulfur battery will offer an alternative  non-nickel-manganese-cobalt cathode solution that supports the global transition to electric vehicles at mass market scale. Lyten's goal is to provide a secure supply of performance-based and environmentally sustainable products to its customers  while also enabling auto manufacturers to take advantage of growing U.S. and European policy incentives  such as those referenced in the Inflation Reduction Act.Lyten's lithium-sulfur battery  composites and sensor technologies are initially being produced on its 145 000-square-foot campus in Silicon Valley. Apart from producing EV batteries  Lyten is working with previous customers to start delivering lithium-sulfur batteries and 3D Graphene-infused composites for specialty markets in 2023. Lyten is collaborating with its strategic investors from across multiple industries to apply Lyten 3D Graphene materials to decarbonize additional  carbon intensive sectors beyond transportation  with more announcements planned for later this year.Lyten 3D GrapheneLyten 3D Graphene is a proprietary  tunable decarbonization supermaterial engineered from natural gas. Lyten's 3D Graphene is similar to two-dimensional graphene in many of its valuable properties; however  3D Graphene can be orders of magnitude more chemically and electrically reactive while also being highly tunable due to its three-dimensional morphology. The processes and equipment to engineer three-dimensional graphene materials are proprietary technological inventions patented by Lyten. Lyten will scale its initial output from its San Jose  California  facility and will soon explore locations for a second phase of output capacity.LytCell EV Lithium-sulfur BatteryLytCell is Lyten's proprietary lithium-sulfur battery that uses Lyten 3D Graphene to address the polysulfide shuttle challenges associated with sulfur  leading to a higher-performance battery that will have more than twice the energy density  and enables extended driving range compared to conventional EV batteries. Unlike lithium-ion and solid-state batteries  LytCell does not use expensive and scarce nickel or cobalt  will have an estimated 60%-plus lower carbon footprint than best-in-class lithium-ion  and an estimated 40% lower carbon footprint than solid state. The LytCell will be domestically and sustainably sourced  liberating manufacturers and consumers from supply chain risks and environmentally unsound mining issues associated with nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) oxide materials.LytRLytR is Lyten's unique thermoplastic formulation – infused with Lyten 3D Graphene – that reduces up to half the weight and materials required while maintaining or improving strength and performance. When Lyten 3D Graphene is tuned for dispersion into polyethylene  as with the LytR material  it significantly strengthens the thermoplastics' chemical and physical properties  thereby requiring less polyethylene material and reducing the carbon footprint by up to 55%.LytenLyten is a materials innovation and applications company and the pioneer of the Lyten 3D Graphene materials platform. Lyten's decarbonization supermaterials are being tuned for a wide range of applications  including the next-generation lithium-sulfur batteries for use in the automotive  aerospace  defense  and other markets; a next-generation LytR polymer composite that can reduce the amount of plastic used by up to half while maintaining structural and impact strength; and next-generation sensor arrays that significantly increase detection sensitivity and selectivity for use in automotive  industrial  health  and safety applications.Lyten is led by a group of experienced executives from across Automotive  Energy  Batteries  Semiconductors  Manufacturing and Defense  lists more than 300 patent matters  and is currently manufacturing Lyten 3D Graphene material  as well as its LytCell EV batteries  in San Jose  California. Lyten was founded in 2015.
