The exhibition will be accessible from June 02 until September 17 2023 ,"A new exhibition is being shown by the Deutsche Börse Photography Foundation that focuses on storytelling by photographer Ernest Cole  documenting the racial struggles of non-white South Africans. The exhibition will be accessible from June 02 until September 17 2023  hosted at The Cube in Eschborn  Germany.The South African photographer was a prominent figure in broadcasting the racial segregation  known as Apartheid (1948-1994)  which occurred as a result of the all-white government at the time dictating a separation between whites and people of color that were living in the country.• These are the 50 best photographers ever!Ernest Cole (1940-1990) was South Africa's first-ever Black freelance photographer  and is noted for his incredible and heart-wrenching book and photo collection titled House of Bondage (1967).This evidences the horrors of Apartheid and the racial discrimination faced by Africans living in the 'White South Africa'  as seen from Cole's perspective as a young black photographer at the time.Pass raid outside Johannesburg station. Every African must show his pass before being allowed to go about his business. From the chapter - ""Police & Passes“ (Image credit: Ernest Cole / Magnum Photos)The new exhibition  Ernest Cole. House of Bondage  will be Cole's first major exhibit in Germany  and feature around 130 photographs covering all 15 of the thematic chapters from his 1967 photo book  accompanied by his own texts and recounts of harrowing events.Cole was actually a self-taught photographer  and it was no accident that he concentrated on powerful photojournalism of Apartheid politics. He wanted to draw global attention to the issues in his home country  so he started working as a photographer at the age of 18.He captured countless forms of violence and repression throughout his career  which he was also subject to as a Black photographer.Included with the exhibition program are some early original prints  plus personal documents of the artist  as well as original editions of images that had been published in magazines  and a filmed interview with Cole from 1969.These boys were caught trespassing in a white area. From the chapter ""Police & Passes"" (Image credit: Ernest Cole / Magnum Photos)Visitors to the exhibition will also find previously unseen works from Cole's House of Bondage chapter titled “Black Ingenuity ” which wasn't published in the original edition of the photo book. (Even without them  the volume is now considered to be one of the most important photo books of the 20th Century.)Images in the exhibition depict some unsettling situations  as Cole photographed subjects and surroundings that include the precarious living conditions of mine laborers  domestic workers serving in white households  and children and young people living in poverty  having been denied any education.Exhibitions like this are important reminders of our history  and in honoring the risk that Cole had to take in bringing light to these awful circumstances by sneaking his negatives out of the country before departing himself. At the time he knew he would never be allowed to return to South Africa after publication.The House of Bondage exhibition has been curated by Anne-Marie Beckmann  of the Deutsche Börse Photography Foundation  and Andréa Holzherr  of Magnum Photos.Students kneel on floor to write.

All statements  other than statements of historical facts  included in this press release are forward-looking statements. These statements include  but are not limited to  forecasts and estimates with respect to Inventiva’s pre-clinical programs and clinical trials  including design  duration  timing  recruitment costs  screening and enrollment for those trials  including the ongoing NATiV3 Phase III clinical trial with lanifibranor in NASH  the LEGEND Phase IIa combination trial with lanifibranor and empagliflozin in patients with NASH and type 2 diabetes and the study with lanifibranor in patients with NAFLD and T2D  potential development of and regulatory pathway for odiparcil  clinical trial data releases and publications  the information  insights and impacts that may be gathered from clinical trials  the potential therapeutic benefits of Inventiva’s product candidates  including lanifibranor  potential regulatory submissions and approvals  and Inventiva’s pipeline and preclinical and clinical development plans  future activities  expectations  plans  growth and prospects of Inventiva  the potential receipt of the second tranche under the EIB loan and any potential transaction or receipt of additional funds  future access to the two-year short-term deposit  and the sufficiency of Inventiva’s cash resources and estimated cash runway. Certain of these statements  forecasts and estimates can be recognized by the use of words such as  without limitation  “believes”  “anticipates”  “expects”  “intends”  “plans”  “seeks”  “estimates”  “may”  “will”  “would”  “could”  “might”  “should”  “designed”  “hopefully”  “target”  “aim”  and “continue” and similar expressions. Such statements are not historical facts but rather are statements of future expectations and other forward-looking statements that are based on management's beliefs. These statements reflect such views and assumptions prevailing as of the date of the statements and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause future results  performance or future events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in such statements. Actual events are difficult to predict and may depend upon factors that are beyond Inventiva's control. There can be no guarantees with respect to pipeline product candidates that the clinical trial results will be available on their anticipated timeline  that future clinical trials will be initiated as anticipated  that product candidates will receive the necessary regulatory approvals  or that any of the anticipated milestones by Inventiva or its partners will be reached on their expected timeline  or at all. Future results may turn out to be materially different from the anticipated future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such statements  forecasts and estimates  due to a number of factors  including that Inventiva is a clinical-stage company with no approved products and no historical product revenues  Inventiva has incurred significant losses since inception  Inventiva has a limited operating history and has never generated any revenue from product sales  Inventiva will require additional capital to finance its operations  in the absence of which  Inventiva may be required to significantly curtail  delay or discontinue one or more of its research or development programs or be unable to expand its operations or otherwise capitalize on its business opportunities and may be unable to continue as a going concern  Inventiva's future success is dependent on the successful clinical development  regulatory approval and subsequent commercialization of current and any future product candidates  preclinical studies or earlier clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results and the results of Inventiva's clinical trials may not support Inventiva's product candidate claims  Inventiva’s expectations with respect to the changes to the clinical development plan for lanifibranor for the treatment of NASH may not be realized and may not support the approval of a New Drug Application  Inventiva may encounter substantial delays in its clinical trials or Inventiva may fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities  the ability of Inventiva to recruit and retain patients in clinical studies  enrollment and retention of patients in clinical trials is an expensive and time-consuming process and could be made more difficult or rendered impossible by multiple factors outside Inventiva's control  Inventiva's product candidates may cause adverse drug reactions or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval  or limit their commercial potential  Inventiva faces substantial competition and Inventiva’s business  and preclinical studies and clinical development programs and timelines  its financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by the current geopolitical events  such as the conflict between Russia and Ukraine  related sanctions and related impacts and potential impacts on the initiation  enrollment and completion of Inventiva’s clinical trials on anticipated timelines  health epidemics  and macroeconomic conditions  including global inflation  rising interest rates  uncertain financial markets and disruptions in banking systems.

Palovarotene is the first medicine to be submitted for regulatory approval for FOP. The only treatments currently available in the E.U. are for managing the symptoms caused by FOP  such as inflammation and chronic pain and not the underlying disease.“While everyone at Ipsen who has worked alongside the FOP community for so many years is extremely disappointed by this decision  we maintain our steadfast commitment to bring a new treatment option to the FOP community and our full attention must now turn to the regulatory processes ongoing in other countries ” said Howard Mayer  Executive Vice President and Head of Research and Development for Ipsen. “FOP often starts in young children and over time  as new bone is formed and accumulates in joints and other areas of the body  most people lose the ability to eat and drink on their own  many will need a wheelchair to get around and life expectancy is shortened. We continue to believe that our Phase III MOVE trial  the first and largest study to be conducted in patients with FOP  has shown that palovarotene has the potential to reduce the new extra-skeletal bone formation caused by the disease and to slow its progression.”The CHMP opinion reviewed data from the palovarotene clinical trial program  including the MOVE study  a Phase III  multi-center  open-label efficacy and safety trial conducted in FOP. The primary objectives of MOVE were to evaluate the efficacy of palovarotene in reducing the volume of new abnormal bone formation  known as heterotopic ossification (HO)  in pediatric and adult patients with FOP  and to study its safety profile.4“Today’s news is a step back for patients with FOP in the E.U. and for the clinicians managing this chronic and progressive disease ” said Dr. Genevieve Baujat  Clinical Geneticist Consultant at Necker-Enfants Malades Hospital  Paris  France. “Many of my colleagues and I have been waiting for a long time for a treatment that can help us manage the devastating disease that is FOP. We got so close  but it seems that in Europe the wait will continue  while we build on our scientific and clinical understanding of the disease  which has been informed through studies like MOVE.”ENDSAbout palovarotenePalovarotene is an investigational oral medicine that selectively targets the retinoic-acid receptor gamma (RARγ)  which is an important regulator of skeletal development and ectopic bone in the retinoid signaling pathway. Palovarotene is designed to mediate the interactions between the receptors  growth factors and proteins within the retinoid signaling pathway to reduce new abnormal bone formation (HO). Palovarotene received Orphan Drug and Breakthrough Therapy Designations from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the potential treatment of FOP and was granted Priority Review. Palovarotene was also granted orphan medicine designation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Palovarotene is in review processes with a number of regulatory authorities including the FDA and the EMA. Palovarotene is currently authorized for use in appropriate patients only in Canada and provisionally in the U.A.E. where it is marketed as SohonosTM (palovarotene capsules).6About the MOVE trialMOVE (NCT03312634) is a Phase III  multicenter  single-arm  open-label trial to assess the efficacy and safety of palovarotene. 107 study participants with FOP received oral palovarotene as a chronic (5mg once daily) and episodic (20mg once daily for 4 weeks  followed by 10mg for ≥8 weeks for flare-ups and trauma) regimen. The primary endpoint was annualized change in new HO volume measured by low-dose whole-body computed tomography.4 Efficacy data from participants enrolled in MOVE were compared with data from FOP Natural History Study (NHS) participants untreated beyond standard of care; individuals ≤65 years of age with clinically diagnosed FOP and a verified ACVR1R206H pathogenic variant were eligible for inclusion in the NHS.5About IpsenIpsen is a global  mid-sized biopharmaceutical company focused on transformative medicines in Oncology  Rare Disease and Neuroscience.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law. Ipsen’s business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers. The risks and uncertainties set out are not exhaustive and the reader is advised to refer to Ipsen’s latest Universal Registration Document  available on ipsen.com .ReferencesBaujat et. Al.

The group said its funding profile “remains strong” with €8.9 million received in the period. The group capitalised project costs of €6.7 million.Davy analyst Colin Grant described it as a year of “strong commercial performance” for the company. “Political support for energy storage continues to grow  and current market pricing remains above our forecast levels ” he said.“As Corre’s projects are not yet operational  the main focus in the results is its financial position. We believe that the monthly cash cost from running the business is around €750 000-€800 000 — implying the company is in a very strong financial position.”He added that Corre also has a large pipeline of projects that have material value  which Davy does not believe is reflected in its current valuation.Crisp entrepreneur Tom Keogh on tasting success in a crowded market Listen | 56:54Corre Energy chief executive Keith McGrane  a University College Dublin-educated geophysicist by background  said 2022 “was about putting in place the building blocks for our growth whilst maintaining prudent capital deployment”.“Our standout priority was to progress our key sites to meet customer demand for long-term storage solutions from a rapidly growing renewables sector seeking to secure and balance future electricity supplies ” he said.“Our projects in the Netherlands and Denmark both made strong progress in 2022  underpinning our focus on the successful commercial close targets for both sites during 2023.“Off the back of our strong commercial performance  we successfully raised €10.9 million in May 2022 and €8.9 million in February 2023. This has allowed the company to advance its near-term projects whilst positioning the business for further planned pipeline growth.“Corre Energy continues to make significant commercial progress on existing and prospective projects in 2023  and we look forward to providing a further market update in the near term.”Grant incomeCorre Energy is chaired by Frank Allen  current chairman of Irish Rail and former chief executive of the Railway Procurement Agency. The company’s headquarters are in the northern Dutch city of Groningen.The group ended the year with €3.4 million in cash. The share price performed well in the period  rising from €1.20 at the start of 2022 to €2.90 by the end of the year  and continued to outperform the market through the early part of 2023.The group’s loss for the year includes a €1.9 million reversal of grant income from the European Climate  Infrastructure and Environment Executive Agency.The company said expenditure remains focused on project development  raising funds and strengthening back-office functions to oversee and support key activities.,negative,0.0,0.11,0.89,mixed,0.11,0.25,0.64,True,English,"['Corre Energy', 'administration costs', 'employee', 'Crisp entrepreneur Tom Keogh', 'University College Dublin-educated geophysicist', 'grid-scale underground storage facilities', 'successful commercial close targets', 'Davy analyst Colin Grant', 'Dublin-listed energy storage company', 'Corre Energy chief executive', 'former chief executive', 'Environment Executive Agency', 'long-term storage solutions', 'initial public offering', 'strong commercial performance', 'prudent capital deployment', 'growing renewables sector', 'Railway Procurement Agency', 'northern Dutch city', 'European Climate, Infrastructure', 'significant commercial progress', 'future electricity supplies', 'monthly cash cost', 'strong financial position', 'current market pricing', 'renewable energy company', 'strong progress', 'Grant income', 'future operation', 'current valuation', 'current chairman', 'Euronext Dublin', 'market value', 'administrative costs', 'green hydrogen', 'Share options', 'cash revaluation', 'employee-related costs', 'administration costs', 'funding profile', 'project costs', 'Political support', 'forecast levels', 'large pipeline', 'material value', 'crowded market', 'Keith McGrane', 'building blocks', 'standout priority', 'customer demand', 'market update', 'near term', 'Frank Allen', 'Irish Rail', 'share price', 'early part', '€1.9 million reversal', 'back-office functions', 'key activities', '€30.2 million loss', 'main focus', 'key sites', 'pipeline growth', 'project development', 'near-term projects', 'prospective projects', 'tax loss', 'construction', 'production', 'sale', 'results', 'year', 'effect', 'READ', 'group', 'period', 'business', 'background', 'place', 'Netherlands', 'Denmark', 'May', 'February', 'existing', 'headquarters', 'Groningen', 'start', 'end', 'funds', '2023']",2023-05-26,2023-05-27,irishtimes.com

The very strong growth recorded in the first half of the year (+12.4%) required the implementation of a volume allocation policy in order to maintain the quality of the wines and secure the future  reducing sales in the second half of the year. Despite this  turnover (champagne sales) for the year rose by +3.1% to €301.8 million at current exchange rates. This performance was based in particular on the Group's value policy implemented in recent years with a positive price/mix effect of +9.5% compared to the previous financial year.Change in profit :During the period from 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023  the Group continued to invest for the long term  particularly in support of its brands and in business development. This investment in sales enhancement contributes to the strength of the brands and the price/mix effect. All of this  supported by the requirement to control costs despite global inflation  contributed to the increase in the Group's operating margin  which reached a record 28.1% at current exchange rates. The Group share of net profit also rose sharply. It stands at €58.5 million at current exchange rates and thus represents 19.4% of the Group's consolidated turnover.Changes in opera tional cash flow and financial structure:Operating cash flow was a strong +€57.8 million for the year. This performance is linked to the growth of the business and to the control of working capital requirements.The elements of the consolidated balance sheet for the year ended 31 March 2023 once again demonstrate the strength of the Group's financial structure. Shareholders' equity  Group share  amounted to €544.7 million and net debt (*) stood at a historically low level of €179.9 million including active cash of €105.8 million. Gearing thus improved further to 0.33 from 0.45 at 31 March 2022.(*) Net debt: financial liabilities and other non-current debts + current financial debts - active cashOutlookDespite an uncertain geopolitical and economic context  the Laurent-Perrier Group is confidently and attentively pursuing its 2021-2025 business plan and maintaining its value strategy based on the following 4 pillars:Exclusive focus on producing and selling high-end champagnesQuality supply based on a partnership policyA portfolio of strong  complimentary brandsWell-controlled worldwide distributionLaurent-Perrier is one of the rare family groups of champagne houses which is listed on the stock market  and which is exclusively dedicated to champagne  and focused on the high-end market.

Palovarotene is the first medicine to be submitted for regulatory approval for FOP. The only treatments currently available in the E.U. are for managing the symptoms caused by FOP  such as inflammation and chronic pain and not the underlying disease.“While everyone at Ipsen who has worked alongside the FOP community for so many years is extremely disappointed by this decision  we maintain our steadfast commitment to bring a new treatment option to the FOP community and our full attention must now turn to the regulatory processes ongoing in other countries ” said Howard Mayer  Executive Vice President and Head of Research and Development for Ipsen. “FOP often starts in young children and over time  as new bone is formed and accumulates in joints and other areas of the body  most people lose the ability to eat and drink on their own  many will need a wheelchair to get around and life expectancy is shortened. We continue to believe that our Phase III MOVE trial  the first and largest study to be conducted in patients with FOP  has shown that palovarotene has the potential to reduce the new extra-skeletal bone formation caused by the disease and to slow its progression.”The CHMP opinion reviewed data from the palovarotene clinical trial program  including the MOVE study  a Phase III  multi-center  open-label efficacy and safety trial conducted in FOP. The primary objectives of MOVE were to evaluate the efficacy of palovarotene in reducing the volume of new abnormal bone formation  known as heterotopic ossification (HO)  in pediatric and adult patients with FOP  and to study its safety profile.4“Today’s news is a step back for patients with FOP in the E.U. and for the clinicians managing this chronic and progressive disease ” said Dr. Genevieve Baujat  Clinical Geneticist Consultant at Necker-Enfants Malades Hospital  Paris  France. “Many of my colleagues and I have been waiting for a long time for a treatment that can help us manage the devastating disease that is FOP. We got so close  but it seems that in Europe the wait will continue  while we build on our scientific and clinical understanding of the disease  which has been informed through studies like MOVE.”ENDSAbout palovarotenePalovarotene is an investigational oral medicine that selectively targets the retinoic-acid receptor gamma (RARγ)  which is an important regulator of skeletal development and ectopic bone in the retinoid signaling pathway. Palovarotene is designed to mediate the interactions between the receptors  growth factors and proteins within the retinoid signaling pathway to reduce new abnormal bone formation (HO). Palovarotene received Orphan Drug and Breakthrough Therapy Designations from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the potential treatment of FOP and was granted Priority Review. Palovarotene was also granted orphan medicine designation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Palovarotene is in review processes with a number of regulatory authorities including the FDA and the EMA. Palovarotene is currently authorized for use in appropriate patients only in Canada and provisionally in the U.A.E. where it is marketed as SohonosTM (palovarotene capsules).6About the MOVE trialMOVE (NCT03312634) is a Phase III  multicenter  single-arm  open-label trial to assess the efficacy and safety of palovarotene. 107 study participants with FOP received oral palovarotene as a chronic (5mg once daily) and episodic (20mg once daily for 4 weeks  followed by 10mg for ≥8 weeks for flare-ups and trauma) regimen. The primary endpoint was annualized change in new HO volume measured by low-dose whole-body computed tomography.4 Efficacy data from participants enrolled in MOVE were compared with data from FOP Natural History Study (NHS) participants untreated beyond standard of care; individuals ≤65 years of age with clinically diagnosed FOP and a verified ACVR1R206H pathogenic variant were eligible for inclusion in the NHS.5About IpsenIpsen is a global  mid-sized biopharmaceutical company focused on transformative medicines in Oncology  Rare Disease and Neuroscience.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law. Ipsen’s business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers.

The audit procedures have been conducted  and the audit report regarding the certification of the accounts is available on the Company's website. The annual financial report for the year ended December 31  2022  is available on the Company's website.Financial Results of Quantum Genomics for the year 2022The results for the year reflect the discontinuation of the development of firibastat in the field of arterial hypertension and heart failure  as a result of the lack of significant efficacy of firibastat compared to placebo in the Phase III FRESH study.Jean-Philippe Milon  CEO of Quantum Genomics  comments:""These clinical results are certainly disappointing for our teams  shareholders  and partners  but we have chosen to be resilient and are making every effort to bounce back quickly  leveraging the agility enabled by our structure. Today  we are determined to reinvent ourselves to create shareholder value in the short term. As soon as we became aware of the results  our teams mobilized to swiftly close our research activities  restructure the company  and reduce fixed costs. These actions were aimed at preserving our cash position to start afresh under the best conditions.We then initiated discussions with various types of companies to explore all opportunities and modalities for potential partnerships  with the aim of building a new business project.We have focused our efforts on companies already in the commercialization phase  operating in high-volume and technologically advanced markets in the healthcare sector. We are currently in advanced discussions with a company  and our goal is to reach an agreement in the very near term to relaunch an ambitious business project. In this endeavor  we benefit from the valuable support of our shareholders  particularly Otium Capital. Their experience allows us to approach this development phase with confidence and serenity.The year 2023 will mark the beginning of a new chapter for Quantum Genomics. I am confident that our company will emerge stronger from this challenge. I would like to thank the shareholders who have stood by our side for their trust and support. I also express my gratitude to our teams  both those who tirelessly dedicated themselves to our research programs in the past and those who are now shaping the future we are building.""As of December 2022  operating revenues amount to €3.0 million compared to €3.2 million a year earlier. These operating revenues consist mainly of payments due under partnership agreements that had been entered into with the aim of commercializing firibastat. These payments remain secured by the company.The operating loss amounts to -€30.4 million  compared to -€19.2 million at the end of December 2021. Personnel expenses have remained under control  while the progress of clinical studies has led to a substantial increase in operating expenses.Reflecting this situation  the amount of trade payables increased from €6.8 million on December 31  2021  to €16.0 million on December 31  2022. Following the cessation of Quantum Genomics' research activities  the company has reached agreements with its suppliers and service providers and will paid a sum of €5.8 million in June 2023 to settle all outstanding amounts and clear its trade payables. This amount has been provisioned in the accounts for the 2022 fiscal year. In total  the amount of abandoned receivables amounts to €9.1 million  recorded as exceptional income.The advances due to the providers responsible for the production of firibastat validation batches remain retained by these providers and are recognized as exceptional expenses  along with the raw materials  assets  finished or semi-finished products held by the company. The amount of exceptional charges related to the discontinuation of research activities amounts to €5.8 million.As a result  the exceptional result amounts to €3 million.After accounting for the research tax credit of €2.5 million  the net result as of December 31  2022  is -€24.9 million. Free cash flow (net cash outflows from operations) amounts to -€24.5 million for the period.At the end of this fiscal year  the company's equity amounts to €3.6 million  compared to €11.4 million at the end of December 2021  including the completion of a capital increase of €17.5 million in April 2022. Available cash reaches €10.4 million  compared to €13.5 million on December 31  2021  while financial liabilities amount to €3.0 million.
