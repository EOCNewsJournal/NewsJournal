25453,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/business/576956-uk-eu-russian-frozen-assets/,UK to retain Russian assets until Kiev is compensated – Guardian,The EU has set up a digital register of damages for Ukraine in an effort to establish an “international compensation mechanism” Read Full Article at RT.com,Moscow has described the seizures as theft and a violation of international lawBritish officials have confirmed that Russian state assets will not be returned even after the conflict in Ukraine is over  but only when Moscow pays reparations to Kiev  The Guardian reported on Friday.According to Russian estimates  more than $300 billion of the country’s foreign currency reserves have been frozen due to Western sanctions. Additionally  billions more worth of assets belonging to Russian citizens and businesses have been seized.Assets and reserves belonging to the Russian state  valued at £26 billion ($32.1 billion)  are currently being held in the UK  according to the Bank of Russia.British MPs and Ukrainian officials have been pressing for the frozen funds to be handed over to Kiev for reconstruction efforts. UK Foreign Secretary James Cleverly insisted last week that Russia’s sovereign assets should remain immobilized until the nation agreed to pay compensation to Ukraine  according to the outlet.The EU and its allies have been looking into methods of confiscating Russian assets  with the Council of Europe last week establishing a digital register of damage for Ukraine – a move that has been described as the first step towards creating an “international compensation mechanism.”The register will be based in The Hague and will serve as “evidence and claims information on damage  loss or injury caused to individuals  and the Ukrainian state.”Earlier  the Financial Times reported that EU officials were examining how they might send Kiev profits generated from some €196.6 billion ($211.1 billion) in Russian assets held at Euroclear. The Russian funds at the world’s largest settlement house have generated hundreds of millions of euros in interest over the past year.However  Western officials are still facing legal challenges over the feasibility of seizing Russian money. According to professor of public international law at the University of Oxford  Antonios Tzanakopoulos  Russian assets are protected by sovereign immunity as an embodiment of the state. Therefore  confiscating these funds would be in breach of international law.Moscow has called Western attempts to transfer the seized assets to Ukraine “barbarism” and “theft ” warning that Russia will respond in kind if necessary.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section,neutral,0.06,0.92,0.02,negative,0.0,0.16,0.84,True,English,"['Russian assets', 'UK', 'Kiev', 'Guardian', 'UK Foreign Secretary James Cleverly', 'foreign currency reserves', 'largest settlement house', 'public international law', 'international compensation mechanism', 'Russian state assets', 'Russian estimates', 'Russian citizens', 'Russian money', 'British officials', 'The Guardian', 'Western sanctions', 'British MPs', 'Ukrainian officials', 'reconstruction efforts', 'The EU', 'first step', 'The Hague', 'claims information', 'Ukrainian state', 'Financial Times', 'EU officials', 'past year', 'Western officials', 'legal challenges', 'Antonios Tzanakopoulos', 'sovereign immunity', 'Western attempts', 'business section', 'Russian assets', 'sovereign assets', 'digital register', 'Russian funds', 'Kiev profits', 'Moscow', 'seizures', 'theft', 'violation', 'conflict', 'Ukraine', 'reparations', 'Friday', 'country', 'billions', 'worth', 'businesses', 'Bank', 'outlet', 'allies', 'methods', 'Council', 'Europe', 'damage', 'move', 'evidence', 'loss', 'injury', 'individuals', 'Euroclear', 'world', 'hundreds', 'millions', 'euros', 'interest', 'feasibility', 'professor', 'University', 'Oxford', 'embodiment', 'breach', 'kind', 'stories', 'economy', 'finance']",2023-05-27,2023-05-28,rt.com

25455,EuroNext,Bing API,https://www.irishtimes.com/your-money/2023/05/28/tracking-down-the-price-at-which-i-bought-shares-many-years-ago/,Tracking down the price at which I bought shares many years ago,Q&A: Share purchases predating the internet age can be particularly tricky so keeping records is strongly advised,Tracing down the price paid for shares many years ago can be tricky  so it makes sense to keep records of your investments.I was gifted CRH shares at different times in the 1970s by my late father  for which I hold the paper certificates. As far as I understand  they were purchased directly from CRH.I am having great difficulty trying to discover the book cost of these shares. I have contacted CRH and their registrars  Link Registrars Limited  in pursuit of this information. The latter advised me to visit the Euronext website to obtain a valuation. I did so  but without success. My stockbroker was also unable to help.Does CRH have a legal obligation to make such information readily accessible? Could you suggest some other avenues I might pursue in my quest?Ms M.S.READ MOREYour father clearly was an early believer in what has since become the largest stock on the Dublin market. CRH was only formed in 1970 when two existing public companies – Cement Limited (which dates back to 1936) and Roadstone Limited (established in 1949) – merged.Back then  the group had annual sales of €70 million in today’s currency  of which 95 per cent was based in Ireland. It didn’t expand into continental Europe until 1973 as Ireland joined the European Economic Community (now the European Union) and took its first step into the US market in 1978.More than 50 years on  it now has a physical presence in 28 countries across the world  employing over 77 000 people with sales of €30.5 billion and profits last year of €3.6 billion.There’s been a lot of change regarding the shares in those years as well. Back in 2011  the company moved its primary listing to London and announced earlier this year that it will depart the Dublin Stock Exchange altogether as it moves its main listing to New York  with chief executive Albert Manifold telling shareholders at the group’s recent annual general meeting that the US now accounts for around three-quarters of group profits (on the basis of Ebitda – earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortisation)  a figure that has grown dramatically over the past decade.He told shareholders the company is now “de facto” a US business even as it keeps its corporate HQ in Dublin  which makes sense on tax grounds.My guess is that  with the arrival of digitisation and the internet  much of the relevant historic paperwork no longer exists or  if it does  no one currently working in the area has any idea where they might find itThe argument from the company is that listing in New York better places it to compete for major US contracts. It helps that US-listed companies tend to trade at a premium to those on European stock markets.That news saw the shares spike earlier this year. They have since calmed down but are still trading just over 20 per cent up so far this year  having lost about the same amount last year amid economic jitters.Finding share pricesBut from your point of view  it is as good a time as any to take stock of where you stand in tax liability terms on these shares. But  as you have found  getting the information to do so is something of a challenge. These are shares bought for you by your father on four separate dates starting in 1970 and running up to 1979.You’ve clearly been round the houses and I have subsequently been in touch with Euronext  which now runs the Irish exchange  one of Ireland’s leading stockbroking firms and the company itself. My guess is that  with the arrival of digitisation and the internet  much of the relevant historic paperwork no longer exists or  if it does  no one currently working in the area has any idea where they might find it.To be fair  the company has been helpful in as far as it can be. It reminded me  importantly  that in relation to the shares acquired in 1970  it is their value on April 6th  1974  that is relevant. The Revenue Commissioners tax and duty manual confirm this  saying: “For CGT purposes  all assets which are held on April 6th  1974  are deemed to have been sold and immediately reacquired at their market value at that date.”CRH could not give me the daily prices for your share purchases on the other three dates  so I turned to the archive of The Irish Times  or more specifically the stock market reports that we have traditionally carriedThe one small mercy of that is that it means I do not have to work out how to convert the share price – which in 1970 was in the old pre-decimal currency days – to the pre-euro decimal price.Back on April 6th  1974  the value of shares in CRH – then known as Cement Roadstone Holdings – was 36 pence and that is the relevant original purchase price for your purposes.CRH could not give me the daily prices for your share purchases on the other three dates  so I turned to the archive of The Irish Times  or more specifically the stock market reports that we have traditionally carried on our business pages.This informed me that the closing price on the other three dates that shares were acquired for on two occasions in the 1978/79 tax year were  starting with the earlier transaction  129p and 80p. The closing price on the day the shares were bought in the following tax year was 104p. On all three occasions the shares moved up or down only by one penny  so I think you could be comfortable taking those prices and not worrying about any swings in price during the trading day.These figures were subsequently confirmed independently by Euronext  the company that now runs the Irish Stock Exchange. Although the data you were looking for related to a time long before it ran the exchange  its team was able to recover the share price for the relevant days pretty quickly when I asked them.At that time  you were allowed to index the price at which assets were acquired to reflect the impact of inflation on their value. Indexation ran out in 2003 but it still applies to assets bought before then up to that point. Revenue has a table which gives the indexation factors.In your case  the multiple for the shares bought in 1970 but calculated on the basis of their 1974 price is 7.528. Taking your 1974 price of 36 pence  this gives you a new “purchase price” for capital gains purposes of 271 pence. We then have to convert that into euro  which you do by dividing that figure by 0.787564  giving you an updated euro base price of €3.44. Don’t get too attached to this figure.. We’ll be returning to it below.For the shares bought in the 1978/79 tax year – remember  tax years back then went from April 6th in one year to April 5th the following year – the indexation factor is 4.148. That updates your 129p price to 535 pence which  in euro  is €6.79. And the other shares acquired that year at 80 pence will now have a purchase price of 332p or €4.21.Finally the purchase price of the shares bought in the 1979/80 tax year at 104p are 389 pence after applying the relevant multiplier  3.742  which then translates into euro at €4.94.Bonus sharesThe picture is further complicated by a couple of bonus issues of shares at no charge made by the company in its early years. This generally happened in lieu of dividend payments.CRH helpfully gave me a list of capital issues in the company down the years. I am assuming you did not take part in any rights issues or placings as you are silent on those.However  in May 1974  there was a bonus issue where existing shareholders got one additional share for every two shares they held at the time. And in April 1978  a further bonus issue gave shareholders two shares for every three ordinary shares held at the time.In your case  the first tranche of shares bought for you are affected. As the second acquisition on your behalf was made on the same day as the second bonus issue  I am assuming the base price of those shares is not affected.With bonus issues  the price paid for the original shares is now apportioned over the larger holding  meaning the unit cost of each share falls. The first 1-for-2 bonus issue in 1974 means that the original shares you bought now have an original base price of 24p  not 36p. The second 2-for-3 bonus issue would lower that base cost further  to 14.4p or  in euro terms after indexation  €1.38 rounded up to the nearest cent.Bear in mind that share sales from holdings that were acquired at different times are generally treated on a first in  first out basisUltimately  for every two shares your father bought in that original 1970 purchase  you had three shares in 1974 and five after the second bonus offer.As the shares are now trading at €44.74 at the time of writing  the ones acquired in 1970 each has a gain of €43.36; those bought in 1978/79 have a gain of €37.95 for the ones bought earlier that year and €40.53 for the other ones. Finally  those bought in 1979/80 have a gain of €39.80.If you do sell  you’ll obviously need to work out those gains on the basis of the actual price you achieve for your shares. Bear in mind that share sales from holdings that were acquired at different times are generally treated on a first in  first out basis  so if you sell only part of your holding  the Revenue will assume the first shares sold are the 1970 ones (including the bonus shares).You can offset any stockbroker and other expenses incurred in selling the shares. After that  you are entitled to a tax-free capital gain in any one year of €1 270. Above this figure  you will be taxed at 33 per cent and it is up to you to file a return and pay the tax due: it is not something Revenue will contact you about – or  at least  if they do  it will because they have become aware you didn’t pay the tax owing  which would not be good for you.Of course  capital gains tax only becomes an issue if you sell the shares. If you hold on to them and they pass on to other people after your death  any capital gains due will die with you and the beneficiary will receive them at whatever their market value is on your death.Getting back to the other element of your question – whether CRH has any legal obligation to make the information you seek readily available – the simple answer is that it does not. It is really the responsibility of the person acquiring shares or any other assets to keep a record of the purchase price. precisely because  with the passage  of time we tend to forget these things.Finally  the stockbrokers – Davy – tell me they do have a probate unit that specialises in precisely this kind of information. I don’t know for certain but I suspect other brokers might have similar arrangements. That might be useful to others who find themselves in a similar position – often while tidying up the affairs of a family member who has died. No doubt there might be a charge for such services  especially for people who would not have been regular customers over the years.Please send your queries to Dominic Coyle  Q&A  The Irish Times  24-28 Tara Street  Dublin 2  or by email to dominic.coyle@irishtimes.com.
