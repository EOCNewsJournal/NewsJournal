For example  those stored in the UK in the amount of 26 billion pounds.IN FACT  this shows  first of all  that Russia  feeling defeated in Ukraine  has already entered the stage of post-war bargaining over reparations. And it is well aware that it needs to start bargaining now. After all  English law (which the same Russian oligarchs like to use to sue each other) will set a precedent.Currently  London's condition is very simple: the assets will not be unfrozen until Moscow agrees to pay Kyiv compensation for the damage caused. The problem for Russia is compounded by the fact that London is already working with the EU on a legal process to use Russian assets to rebuild Ukraine. So far  it is only about paying compensation from the interest of frozen Russian assets. But the longer Russia bargains  the more the counter will turn.As for the figures  the European Union is currently discussing the issue of redirecting to Ukraine the profits from frozen Russian assets worth almost 200 billion euros  which are stored in the Belgian settlement center Euroclear. This step will not lead to the expropriation of the assets themselves  but it is a very powerful escalation of the West's financial pressure on Russia.So far  from the point of view of European jurisprudence  everything looks polite: Euroclear is reinvesting these assets  which generates additional profit. Due to high interest rates and the accumulation of significant funds due to sanctions  the clearinghouse is making a record profit  which will be sent to Ukraine.In the first quarter of this year  Euroclear reported €734 million in interest income. A similar approach could be applied to a wider range of frozen Russian assets  including those stuck in the settlement center of Luxembourg-based Clearstream.For clarification: Euroclear and Clearstream are foreign custodians [organizations that store and account for financial assets] with whom the National Settlement Depository (NSD) has opened accounts. Any cross-border transactions  settlements  or even changes in the place of storage of Russian securities went exclusively through NSD. All the largest Russian brokers have accounts there. The money continues to work - the interest will go to Ukraine.Moscow knows this  so they are nervous. They realize that ordinary Russians will continue to eat cones but keep quiet. But missile production requires money  not cones. That is why Russia has been desperately attacking Ukrainian cities in recent days. Because it's running out of steam.Moscow is shooting itself in the foot with ""new territories""On May 26  Russia finally passed in the second and final reading a law on fines of up to 1 million rubles or arrest for up to 15 days for distributing maps that ""deny the territorial integrity of Russia.""And on May 27  Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Galuzin once again named ""recognition of the new territorial realities that have emerged as a result of the exercise of the right of peoples to self-determination"" among the conditions for ""a comprehensive  just and lasting peace in Ukraine.""IN FACT  from a domestic political point of view  this is a meaningless act. The question of the ""integrity of Russia"" is not a subject of not only heated  but any debate in Russia at all. (Although  of course  another repressive law could lead to new persecutions).In reality  this is a story of Russia shooting itself in the foot. Crimea and the ""new territories"" are not recognized as Russian anywhere in the world. In this sense  Russia has legally become a state that has no internationally recognized borders.With all the ensuing consequences. Up to and including the creation of demilitarized zones  which are increasingly being discussed in the context of postwar Russia.There is every reason to do so. After all  since 2014  Russia's international treaties on borders have been called into question by Moscow's own policy  which actually denies its own obligations. For example  the inviolability of the 1991 borders with Ukraine has been repeatedly confirmed by Russia's international obligations  both in the Yeltsin era (the ""Great Treaty""  whose 26th anniversary is on May 31) and in the Putin era (the treaty on the state border).So the longer Russia painfully insists on recognizing its card-carrying ""new territorial realities "" the more real world sanctions will work. The world's meter is running smoothly. At the end of the road  you will still have to pay.The Kremlin is losing ""its"" countries before our eyesEven countries that Moscow still considers its satellites do not recognize Russia's new territorial realities. The reaction of Prime Minister of Armenia  Pashinyan  who clearly showed Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zakharova her place  was quite revealing in this regard.Commenting on Pashinyan's words about a possible withdrawal from the CSTO  she said literally the following: ""It seems to me that we still need to understand the danger of manipulating words.""To which Pashinyan (who did not even realize who she was talking about at first) said that the Russian Foreign Ministry could not comment on what he was saying.IN FACT  the spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry has long been impersonating a foreign policy figure. Everyone was silent on this for a long time. But Pashinyan was the first to point out Zakharova's true position. In any case  another diplomatic scandal between Moscow and Yerevan has broken out.In this regard  the results of a recent study conducted by the American Gallup Institute for Public Opinion Research are interesting. It proved that the invasion of Ukraine has critically worsened Russia's position and attitude towards it in all post-Soviet countries. In most of the former Soviet republics  a space that the Kremlin considers to be a zone of its interests and special influence  approval of the Russian leadership's actions has dropped by more than 10%.In Azerbaijan  the rating of the Russian Federation has dropped by 2.6 times. Only 23% of respondents there now approve of Moscow's actions. In other countries that have historically sympathized with the Kremlin (Armenia  Kazakhstan  and Moldova)  the share of those who disapprove of Russia's actions has exceeded the share of those who approve for the first time.In Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan  the majority of people still sympathize with Russia  but there  too  approval of Putin's actions has declined significantly.26 years of Russia's floating aggression against UkraineAll these countries are understandable. After all  right now  literally on live TV  they are convinced that they cannot trust Russia. May 28 is another confirmation of this. It was on this day in 1997 that Ukraine signed a series of agreements with Russia concerning the Black Sea Fleet.At that time  an agreement was signed between Ukraine and Russia on the parameters of the division of the Black Sea Fleet  which  among other things  stipulated that the main base of the fleet was located in the Ukrainian city of Sevastopol  and the Black Sea Fleet itself used certain points of deployment and locations.The agreement stipulated that ""military formations carry out their activities in the places of deployment in accordance with the legislation of the Russian Federation  respect the sovereignty of Ukraine  comply with its legislation and do not allow interference in the internal affairs of Ukraine.""IN FACT  all this turned into first a floating and then a full-scale Russian aggression against Ukraine. The agreements were concluded for 25 years with automatic renewal for subsequent five-year periods  unless either party notified the other in a letter of termination no later than one year before the expiration date.On April 21  2010  in Kharkiv  the then presidents of Ukraine and Russia  Yanukovych and Medvedev  signed the Kharkiv Agreements.Everyone knows what happened next. In 2014  the Russian Black Sea Fleet  in cooperation with other Russian units  carried out the military occupation of Ukrainian Crimea.It was the State Duma of Russia  not the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine  that unilaterally denounced four interstate agreements on the basing of the Black Sea Fleet in Crimea on March 31  2014.Deputy Foreign Minister of Russia Grigory Karasin explained at the time: ""Today  there are no grounds for continuing legal relations regarding the deployment of the Russian Black Sea Fleet's facilities and personnel in Ukraine  including the Russian side's obligations to provide the Ukrainian side with payment or other compensation or reimbursement.""This is how Russia made its civilizational choice. In the end  all this led to a full-scale war  which will result in the Russian Black Sea Fleet finally leaving Ukrainian Crimea  and Russia will pay for everything. And at a much higher cost than it had agreed with Ukraine back then  26 years ago.

The Nigerian photographer and contemporary artist is renowned for his extensive self-portraits depicting himself in the style of leading historical figures  and his dedicated near 50-year career has a definitive focus on performative photography.The prize was awarded to Fosso in recognition of his retrospective self-titled exhibition  which was displayed for four months at the Maison Europeìenne de la Photographie in Paris  and cultivated his iconic as well as lesser-known series plus previously unseen works and archival content.• These are the best lenses for portrait photographyOne of the most distinguished awards that a photographer could receive in their lifetimes  the Deutsche Börse Photography Foundation Prize was awarded to Fosso last night at a ceremony hosted at The Photographers' Gallery  London  in addition to receiving the grand prize of £30 000 ($37 000 / AU$56 000 approximately).Born in Kumba  Cameroon  in 1962 but raised in Nigeria  photographer Samuel Fosso opened up Studio Photo Nationale in 1975 at the age of just 13 - after having fled the Biafran War a few years prior.Specializing in commercial work as well as portraiture for most of his career  Fosso was given the title of 'a man with 1000 faces' as he creatively reshapes himself into another for each image.Leading historical figures that have been portrayed by Fosso in his self-portraits include Martin Luther King  Angela Davis  Muhammad Ali  Tommie Smith  Patrice Lumumba  Malcolm X  and Haile Selassie  many of which form his series African Spirits (2008)  while his earlier works from the 1970s are reflective of performance and social archetypes. In 2017  he created a self-portrait as the ""Black Pope"".On winning the Deutsche Börse Prize  Fosso has shared that: “Winning this prestigious prize  recognised as one of the most important in the field of photography  means that my work is recognised by the artistic community. This recognition is very important to me. I feel a lot of joy and pride.”Deana Lawson  last year's winner of the Deutsche Börse Prize  was praised for reframing the black experience through photography with her solo exhibition  Entropy which was displayed at the Kunsthalle Basel art gallery in Switzerland.The Deutsche Börse Photography Foundation Prize itself was founded in 1996 by The Photographers’ Gallery  and now in its twenty-seventh year  aims to reward artists and their projects which have stood out as having made the most significant contributions to the fields of international contemporary photography.The other shortlisted Deutsche Börse photographers for 2023 included Bieke Depoorter  Arthur Jafa  and Frida Orupabo – who all received £5 000 (and $6 000 / AU$9 000 approximately). The exhibition showcasing all four artists will be on display at The Photographers’ Gallery until June 11 2023.• You might also be interested in the best camera for portraits  or more specifically - the best Canon portrait lenses  plus the best Nikon portrait lenses  and not forgetting the best lenses for creating bokeh.• Take a look at the best books on portrait photography to brush up your skills  and see these Three prime lenses every portrait photographer needs to consider  plus our 14 tips for getting your best-ever portrait shots",neutral,0.02,0.98,0.0,positive,0.93,0.07,0.0,True,English,"['£30,000 Deutsche Börse prize', 'Photographer Samuel Fosso', 'prestigious Deutsche Börse Photography Foundation Prize', 'The Deutsche Börse Photography Foundation Prize', 'Deutsche Börse Prize', 'Deutsche Börse photographers', 'Kunsthalle Basel art gallery', 'best Canon portrait lenses', 'best Nikon portrait lenses', 'The Photographers’ Gallery', ""The Photographers' Gallery"", 'international contemporary photography', 'leading historical figures', 'Maison Europeìenne', 'Martin Luther King', 'Three prime lenses', 'The Nigerian photographer', 'prestigious prize', 'near 50-year career', 'retrospective self-titled exhibition', 'portrait photography', 'grand prize', 'photographer Samuel Fosso', 'performative photography', 'best lenses', 'portrait photographer', 'portrait shots', 'contemporary artist', 'best camera', 'best books', 'extensive self-portraits', 'definitive focus', 'four months', 'la Photographie', 'unseen works', 'distinguished awards', 'Photo Nationale', 'Biafran War', 'Angela Davis', 'Muhammad Ali', 'Tommie Smith', 'Patrice Lumumba', 'Malcolm X', 'Haile Selassie', 'African Spirits', 'earlier works', 'social archetypes', 'Black Pope', 'artistic community', 'Deana Lawson', 'black experience', 'solo exhibition', 'twenty-seventh year', 'significant contributions', 'other shortlisted', 'Bieke Depoorter', 'Arthur Jafa', 'Frida Orupabo', 'Margaret London', 'lesser-known series', 'commercial work', 'four artists', 'recipient', 'style', 'dedicated', 'recognition', 'Paris', 'iconic', 'content', 'lifetimes', 'ceremony', 'addition', 'Kumba', 'Cameroon', 'Studio', 'age', 'portraiture', 'man', '1000 faces', '1970s', 'field', 'lot', 'joy', 'pride', 'winner', 'Entropy', 'Switzerland', 'projects', 'display', 'June', 'bokeh', 'look', 'skills', '14 tips']",2023-05-29,2023-05-29,msn.com

As far as I understand  they were purchased directly from CRH.I am having great difficulty trying to discover the book cost of these shares. I have contacted CRH and their registrars  Link Registrars Limited  in pursuit of this information. The latter advised me to visit the Euronext website to obtain a valuation. I did so  but without success. My stockbroker was also unable to help.Does CRH have a legal obligation to make such information readily accessible? Could you suggest some other avenues I might pursue in my quest?Ms M.S.READ MOREYour father clearly was an early believer in what has since become the largest stock on the Dublin market. CRH was only formed in 1970 when two existing public companies – Cement Limited (which dates back to 1936) and Roadstone Limited (established in 1949) – merged.Back then  the group had annual sales of €70 million in today’s currency  of which 95 per cent was based in Ireland. It didn’t expand into continental Europe until 1973 as Ireland joined the European Economic Community (now the European Union) and took its first step into the US market in 1978.More than 50 years on  it now has a physical presence in 28 countries across the world  employing over 77 000 people with sales of €30.5 billion and profits last year of €3.6 billion.There’s been a lot of change regarding the shares in those years as well. Back in 2011  the company moved its primary listing to London and announced earlier this year that it will depart the Dublin Stock Exchange altogether as it moves its main listing to New York  with chief executive Albert Manifold telling shareholders at the group’s recent annual general meeting that the US now accounts for around three-quarters of group profits (on the basis of Ebitda – earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortisation)  a figure that has grown dramatically over the past decade.He told shareholders the company is now “de facto” a US business even as it keeps its corporate HQ in Dublin  which makes sense on tax grounds.My guess is that  with the arrival of digitisation and the internet  much of the relevant historic paperwork no longer exists or  if it does  no one currently working in the area has any idea where they might find itThe argument from the company is that listing in New York better places it to compete for major US contracts. It helps that US-listed companies tend to trade at a premium to those on European stock markets.That news saw the shares spike earlier this year. They have since calmed down but are still trading just over 20 per cent up so far this year  having lost about the same amount last year amid economic jitters.Finding share pricesBut from your point of view  it is as good a time as any to take stock of where you stand in tax liability terms on these shares. But  as you have found  getting the information to do so is something of a challenge. These are shares bought for you by your father on four separate dates starting in 1970 and running up to 1979.You’ve clearly been round the houses and I have subsequently been in touch with Euronext  which now runs the Irish exchange  one of Ireland’s leading stockbroking firms and the company itself. My guess is that  with the arrival of digitisation and the internet  much of the relevant historic paperwork no longer exists or  if it does  no one currently working in the area has any idea where they might find it.To be fair  the company has been helpful in as far as it can be. It reminded me  importantly  that in relation to the shares acquired in 1970  it is their value on April 6th  1974  that is relevant. The Revenue Commissioners tax and duty manual confirm this  saying: “For CGT purposes  all assets which are held on April 6th  1974  are deemed to have been sold and immediately reacquired at their market value at that date.”CRH could not give me the daily prices for your share purchases on the other three dates  so I turned to the archive of The Irish Times  or more specifically the stock market reports that we have traditionally carriedThe one small mercy of that is that it means I do not have to work out how to convert the share price – which in 1970 was in the old pre-decimal currency days – to the pre-euro decimal price.Back on April 6th  1974  the value of shares in CRH – then known as Cement Roadstone Holdings – was 36 pence and that is the relevant original purchase price for your purposes.CRH could not give me the daily prices for your share purchases on the other three dates  so I turned to the archive of The Irish Times  or more specifically the stock market reports that we have traditionally carried on our business pages.This informed me that the closing price on the other three dates that shares were acquired for on two occasions in the 1978/79 tax year were  starting with the earlier transaction  129p and 80p. The closing price on the day the shares were bought in the following tax year was 104p. On all three occasions the shares moved up or down only by one penny  so I think you could be comfortable taking those prices and not worrying about any swings in price during the trading day.These figures were subsequently confirmed independently by Euronext  the company that now runs the Irish Stock Exchange. Although the data you were looking for related to a time long before it ran the exchange  its team was able to recover the share price for the relevant days pretty quickly when I asked them.At that time  you were allowed to index the price at which assets were acquired to reflect the impact of inflation on their value. Indexation ran out in 2003 but it still applies to assets bought before then up to that point. Revenue has a table which gives the indexation factors.In your case  the multiple for the shares bought in 1970 but calculated on the basis of their 1974 price is 7.528. Taking your 1974 price of 36 pence  this gives you a new “purchase price” for capital gains purposes of 271 pence. We then have to convert that into euro  which you do by dividing that figure by 0.787564  giving you an updated euro base price of €3.44. Don’t get too attached to this figure.. We’ll be returning to it below.For the shares bought in the 1978/79 tax year – remember  tax years back then went from April 6th in one year to April 5th the following year – the indexation factor is 4.148. That updates your 129p price to 535 pence which  in euro  is €6.79. And the other shares acquired that year at 80 pence will now have a purchase price of 332p or €4.21.Finally the purchase price of the shares bought in the 1979/80 tax year at 104p are 389 pence after applying the relevant multiplier  3.742  which then translates into euro at €4.94.Bonus sharesThe picture is further complicated by a couple of bonus issues of shares at no charge made by the company in its early years. This generally happened in lieu of dividend payments.CRH helpfully gave me a list of capital issues in the company down the years. I am assuming you did not take part in any rights issues or placings as you are silent on those.However  in May 1974  there was a bonus issue where existing shareholders got one additional share for every two shares they held at the time. And in April 1978  a further bonus issue gave shareholders two shares for every three ordinary shares held at the time.In your case  the first tranche of shares bought for you are affected. As the second acquisition on your behalf was made on the same day as the second bonus issue  I am assuming the base price of those shares is not affected.With bonus issues  the price paid for the original shares is now apportioned over the larger holding  meaning the unit cost of each share falls. The first 1-for-2 bonus issue in 1974 means that the original shares you bought now have an original base price of 24p  not 36p. The second 2-for-3 bonus issue would lower that base cost further  to 14.4p or  in euro terms after indexation  €1.38 rounded up to the nearest cent.Bear in mind that share sales from holdings that were acquired at different times are generally treated on a first in  first out basisUltimately  for every two shares your father bought in that original 1970 purchase  you had three shares in 1974 and five after the second bonus offer.As the shares are now trading at €44.74 at the time of writing  the ones acquired in 1970 each has a gain of €43.36; those bought in 1978/79 have a gain of €37.95 for the ones bought earlier that year and €40.53 for the other ones. Finally  those bought in 1979/80 have a gain of €39.80.If you do sell  you’ll obviously need to work out those gains on the basis of the actual price you achieve for your shares. Bear in mind that share sales from holdings that were acquired at different times are generally treated on a first in  first out basis  so if you sell only part of your holding  the Revenue will assume the first shares sold are the 1970 ones (including the bonus shares).You can offset any stockbroker and other expenses incurred in selling the shares. After that  you are entitled to a tax-free capital gain in any one year of €1 270. Above this figure  you will be taxed at 33 per cent and it is up to you to file a return and pay the tax due: it is not something Revenue will contact you about – or  at least  if they do  it will because they have become aware you didn’t pay the tax owing  which would not be good for you.Of course  capital gains tax only becomes an issue if you sell the shares. If you hold on to them and they pass on to other people after your death  any capital gains due will die with you and the beneficiary will receive them at whatever their market value is on your death.Getting back to the other element of your question – whether CRH has any legal obligation to make the information you seek readily available – the simple answer is that it does not. It is really the responsibility of the person acquiring shares or any other assets to keep a record of the purchase price. precisely because  with the passage  of time we tend to forget these things.Finally  the stockbrokers – Davy – tell me they do have a probate unit that specialises in precisely this kind of information. I don’t know for certain but I suspect other brokers might have similar arrangements. That might be useful to others who find themselves in a similar position – often while tidying up the affairs of a family member who has died. No doubt there might be a charge for such services  especially for people who would not have been regular customers over the years.Please send your queries to Dominic Coyle  Q&A  The Irish Times  24-28 Tara Street  Dublin 2  or by email to dominic.coyle@irishtimes.com.

This resulted in net inflows of €1.3 billion at Private Clients  and an increase in assets under management (AuM). In addition to this organic growth  we completed the acquisition of the remaining stake in Belgian wealth manager Mercier Vanderlinden in the quarter. We also took a major step with Evi van Lanschot with our intended acquisition of Robeco's online investment platform (AuM: €4.7 billion). This acquisition is expected to complete this summer.Van Lanschot Kempen shares have been included in both the Euronext AMX Index and the AEX ESG Index since March 2023  underlining our growth both as an organisation and in terms of sustainability in the past few years. For us this is a great motivation to continue on our track and help our clients navigate through the key transitions of our time.""In the first quarter client assets increased to €128.3 billion (2022: €124.2 billion) and AuM to €112.8 billion (2022: €107.8 billion). Savings came down in the quarter to €11.6 billion (2022: €12.7 billion)  mostly as clients converted savings into investments. The loan portfolio remained stable at €9.4 billion and the addition to loan loss provisions was minor.Thanks in part to increased interest income  first-quarter results at Private Clients were strong  whereas less favourable conditions for mergers and acquisitions caused a decrease at Investment Banking Clients. The result from financial transactions also was lower than in the first quarter of 2022. Wholesale & Institutional Clients continues to focus on achieving profitable growth for investment strategies in Western Europe and for fiduciary management in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.Our CET 1 ratio remains strong at 20.4% (2022: 20.6%) and Van Lanschot Kempen plans to return €2.00 per share to its shareholders in the second half of 2023 (about €85 million in total)  subject to regulatory approval.In April 2023 Van Lanschot Kempen completed its accelerated acquisition of the remaining 30% stake in Mercier Vanderlinden  for which it paid 53% in cash and 47% in shares  with a lock-up period until 2030. As a result  Mercier Vanderlinden's managing partners obtained a 3.9% stake in Van Lanschot Kempen. Together with the Van Lanschot Belgium team they are currently preparing for the start of Mercier Van Lanschot to realise our growth ambitions within private banking in Belgium.At the end of March  four of the 10-strong small-cap team at Van Lanschot Kempen Investment Management announced their intention to leave. The quality of the team's investment process is safeguarded by the Head of the Small-Cap Strategy and the team consisting of five small-cap managers  complemented by experienced sector specialists from Van Lanschot Kempen Investment Management's other investment teams. Two new people have since been hired to help return the team back to full strength.Private Banking boosted its presence in the Groningen region with the addition of four new Private Banking colleagues  enabling Van Lanschot Kempen to respond even better to growth opportunities in this area.FINANCIAL CALENDAR25 May 2023 Annual General Meeting29 May 2023 Ex-dividend date6 June 2023 2022 dividend payment date24 August 2023 Publication of 2023 half-year results2 November 2023 Publication of 2023 third-quarter trading updateMedia Relations: + 31 20 354 45 85; mediarelations@vanlanschotkempen.comInvestor Relations: +31 20 354 45 90; investorrelations@vanlanschotkempen.comAbout Van Lanschot KempenVan Lanschot Kempen is an independent  specialist wealth manager active in private banking  investment management and investment banking  with the aim of preserving and creating wealth  in a sustainable way  for both its clients and the society of which it is part.
