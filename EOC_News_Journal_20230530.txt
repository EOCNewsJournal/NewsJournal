Due to the sharp rise in borrowing costs in the last three quarters  the Company is feeling the effects of dynamically increasing interest costs for refinancing and new loans. On the other hand  the ECB's interest rate hikes in particular are leading to increasingly declining asking prices on the real estate market  which is reflected in a currently increasingly filling acquisition pipeline with interesting local supply properties that fit exactly into DKR's purchase profile. The Company expects this trend to intensify further  especially towards the end of 2023  and derives strong growth opportunities through a significant purchase volume from this.After careful consideration  the Management Board has come to the conclusion that in the current situation it is necessary to maintain the highest possible level of liquidity. On the one hand  this allows debt instruments that are expiring in the following year already to be gradually repaid  and on the other hand  growth opportunities that arise can be quickly seized through further acquisitions.Furthermore  the Company would like to strengthen its independence and push ahead with the separation from the founding shareholder and main shareholder Obotritia Capital KGaA.The Company has derived the following measures to achieve its goals:Amendment of the dividend proposal and reduction of the dividend distribution for the financial year 2021/2022 to EUR 0.12 per shareAs already announced in advance in an insider information  the Management Board amends its proposal for the appropriation of profits dated 15 December 2022 for the past financial year 2021/2022 by retroactively allocating a reinvestment reserve in the amount of EUR 12 689 275. This is possible according to § 13 (3) REIT Act in the amount of half of the realised capital gains from the property sales of the financial year 2021/2022. The remaining distributable amount shall be distributed as dividend in the amount of EUR 4 218 713 or EUR 0.12 per share (instead of EUR 0.48 per share) and the calculated remaining amount shall be transferred to the profit carried forward. The reinvestment reserve is then to be used to partially finance the latest acquisitions.In order to take into account possible opportunities and risks  the reduction of the dividend distribution is intended to ensure the highest possible flexibility in the further operational management of the Company.The Annual General Meeting must vote on the new resolution on the appropriation of profits.Termination of short-term investments of surplus cash and cash equivalentsIn view of the re-availability of interest on credit balances and in order to increase the directly available liquidity  the short-term investments were terminated. Since the beginning of the financial year  no new short-term investments have been made and instead around EUR 40 million has already flowed back directly to DKR. Full repayment of all cash and cash equivalents is expected by September 2023.Capital recycling for further growth financingThe Company currently has several purchase offers at attractive purchase price factors for individual locations  which are currently being reviewed and negotiated. DKR is considering using attractive sales options  especially in the current situation  in order to invest them in new  higher-yielding local supply properties in the sense of capital recycling.The Company currently has an attractive acquisition pipeline with local retail properties valued at approx. EUR 84 million at an average acquisition factor of 11 times the annual rent (9% yield)  the realisation of which would lead to strong growth in the rental income of the property portfolio.Changes in the Supervisory Board and Management Board Rolf Elgeti moves from the Management Board to the Supervisory BoardThe Chairman of the Supervisory Board Hans-Ulrich Sutter has informed the Company that he will resign from his mandate as well as from his position as Deputy Chairman of the Audit Committee at the end of the next Annual General Meeting for personal reasons.At the same time  the Chairman of the Management Board Rolf Elgeti (CEO) has decided to resign his mandate with effect from the end of the next Annual General Meeting. In the future  the operational business activities will be carried out by the Management Board members Alexander Kroth (CIO) and Christian Hellmuth (CFO). Rolf Elgeti intends to stand for the chairmanship of the Supervisory Board at the upcoming Annual General Meeting.Annual General Meeting 2023 on 13th July 2023The Company will shortly convene the 2023 Annual General Meeting  which will take place in Berlin on 13 July 2023.Rolf Elgeti  CEO of Deutsche Konsum REIT-AG:We sincerely thank our Supervisory Board Chairman Mr Sutter for his valuable work since the IPO of DKR and wish him all the best personally. We also want to take this as an opportunity to take the Company into a new and exciting phase and to reallocate the tasks ahead. For this reason  I would like to step down from my role as Chairman of the Management Board in the future and continue to be available to the Company as Chairman of the Supervisory Board.Alexander Kroth  CIO:The acquisition pipeline has filled up strongly again in the past two months with attractive properties that fit our portfolio very well and that were not offered to us at these price levels two years ago. We think that this trend will continue until the end of the year  which will create great growth opportunities for us.Christian Hellmuth  CFO:The change in the resolution on the appropriation of profits and the resulting lower dividend distribution was not easy for us  but from the Company's point of view it makes a lot of sense in the current environment  because it increases the financial flexibility for upcoming refinancing and establishes additional value creation opportunities through investments in the portfolio and through acquisitions of further retail properties  which is why we are asking the shareholders for their approval at the Annual General Meeting.About the CompanyDeutsche Konsum REIT-AG  Broderstorf  is a listed real estate company focusing on German retail properties for everyday goods in established micro-locations.

The Company considers the current situation on the real estate market to be exciting and full of opportunities and derives positive growth prospects for itself from this. Due to the sharp rise in borrowing costs in the last three quarters  the Company is feeling the effects of dynamically increasing interest costs for refinancing and new loans. On the other hand  the ECB's interest rate hikes in particular are leading to increasingly declining asking prices on the real estate market  which is reflected in a currently increasingly filling acquisition pipeline with interesting local supply properties that fit exactly into DKR's purchase profile. The Company expects this trend to intensify further  especially towards the end of 2023  and derives strong growth opportunities through a significant purchase volume from this. After careful consideration  the Management Board has come to the conclusion that in the current situation it is necessary to maintain the highest possible level of liquidity. On the one hand  this allows debt instruments that are expiring in the following year already to be gradually repaid  and on the other hand  growth opportunities that arise can be quickly seized through further acquisitions. Furthermore  the Company would like to strengthen its independence and push ahead with the separation from the founding shareholder and main shareholder Obotritia Capital KGaA. The Company has derived the following measures to achieve its goals: Amendment of the dividend proposal and reduction of the dividend distribution for the financial year 2021/2022 to EUR 0.12 per shareAs already announced in advance in an insider information  the Management Board amends its proposal for the appropriation of profits dated 15 December 2022 for the past financial year 2021/2022 by retroactively allocating a reinvestment reserve in the amount of EUR 12 689 275. This is possible according to § 13 (3) REIT Act in the amount of half of the realised capital gains from the property sales of the financial year 2021/2022. The remaining distributable amount shall be distributed as dividend in the amount of EUR 4 218 713 or EUR 0.12 per share (instead of EUR 0.48 per share) and the calculated remaining amount shall be transferred to the profit carried forward. The reinvestment reserve is then to be used to partially finance the latest acquisitions. In order to take into account possible opportunities and risks  the reduction of the dividend distribution is intended to ensure the highest possible flexibility in the further operational management of the Company. The Annual General Meeting must vote on the new resolution on the appropriation of profits. Termination of short-term investments of surplus cash and cash equivalentsIn view of the re-availability of interest on credit balances and in order to increase the directly available liquidity  the short-term investments were terminated. Since the beginning of the financial year  no new short-term investments have been made and instead around EUR 40 million has already flowed back directly to DKR. Full repayment of all cash and cash equivalents is expected by September 2023. Capital recycling for further growth financingThe Company currently has several purchase offers at attractive purchase price factors for individual locations  which are currently being reviewed and negotiated. DKR is considering using attractive sales options  especially in the current situation  in order to invest them in new  higher-yielding local supply properties in the sense of capital recycling. The Company currently has an attractive acquisition pipeline with local retail properties valued at approx. EUR 84 million at an average acquisition factor of 11 times the annual rent (9% yield)  the realisation of which would lead to strong growth in the rental income of the property portfolio. Changes in the Supervisory Board and Management Board – Rolf Elgeti moves from the Management Board to the Supervisory BoardThe Chairman of the Supervisory Board Hans-Ulrich Sutter has informed the Company that he will resign from his mandate as well as from his position as Deputy Chairman of the Audit Committee at the end of the next Annual General Meeting for personal reasons. At the same time  the Chairman of the Management Board Rolf Elgeti (CEO) has decided to resign his mandate with effect from the end of the next Annual General Meeting. In the future  the operational business activities will be carried out by the Management Board members Alexander Kroth (CIO) and Christian Hellmuth (CFO). Rolf Elgeti intends to stand for the chairmanship of the Supervisory Board at the upcoming Annual General Meeting. Annual General Meeting 2023 on 13th July 2023The Company will shortly convene the 2023 Annual General Meeting  which will take place in Berlin on 13 July 2023. Rolf Elgeti  CEO of Deutsche Konsum REIT-AG:“We sincerely thank our Supervisory Board Chairman Mr Sutter for his valuable work since the IPO of DKR and wish him all the best personally. We also want to take this as an opportunity to take the Company into a new and exciting phase and to reallocate the tasks ahead. For this reason  I would like to step down from my role as Chairman of the Management Board in the future and continue to be available to the Company as Chairman of the Supervisory Board.“ Alexander Kroth  CIO:“The acquisition pipeline has filled up strongly again in the past two months with attractive properties that fit our portfolio very well and that were not offered to us at these price levels two years ago. We think that this trend will continue until the end of the year  which will create great growth opportunities for us.“ Christian Hellmuth  CFO:“The change in the resolution on the appropriation of profits and the resulting lower dividend distribution was not easy for us  but from the Company's point of view it makes a lot of sense in the current environment  because it increases the financial flexibility for upcoming refinancing and establishes additional value creation opportunities through investments in the portfolio and through acquisitions of further retail properties  which is why we are asking the shareholders for their approval at the Annual General Meeting.“About the CompanyDeutsche Konsum REIT-AG  Broderstorf  is a listed real estate company focusing on German retail properties for everyday goods in established micro-locations.

Sustainable farming methods work to improve the long-term health and production of the land while reducing the detrimental effects of farming on the ecosystem. This can involve utilising renewable energy sources  decreasing the usage of pesticides and fertilisers  and saving water and energy.Commercial greenhouses are a crucial tool for encouraging sustainable farming methods since they enable more effective use of resources like water and energy and can lessen the need for artificial pesticides and fertilisers. For instance  improved monitoring systems can assist growers in maximising resource use and minimising waste  while hydroponic growth techniques used in commercial greenhouses can use up to 90% less water than conventional field farming.Download Exclusive Sample of Reporthttps://www.visiongain.com/report/commercial-greenhouse-market-2023/#download_sampe_divHow has COVID-19 had a significant negative impact on the Commercial Greenhouse Market?The COVID-19 epidemic has affected the commercial greenhouse business in both positive and negative ways. Here is a thorough evaluation of how COVID-19 has affected the market for commercial greenhouses: Due to the pandemic's impact on global supply networks  consumers are becoming more interested in locally grown  fresh vegetables. Commercial greenhouse owners now have options to offer year-round local produce as a result.The demand for some products  such lettuce and tomatoes  has decreased as a result of the closure of restaurants and the food service sector. Commercial greenhouse operators have been compelled to switch their production to crops with higher demand  such herbs and microgreens  as a result of this.Because workers are unable or unwilling to work due to health concerns  the pandemic has resulted in a labour shortage. Commercial greenhouse operators who depend on seasonal workers to produce  tend  and harvest crops now face difficulties as a result.How will this Report Benefit you?Visiongain’s 333-page report provides 124 tables and 170 charts/graphs.

Consumer preferences for fresher and healthier goods  worries about the environmental effects of long-distance transportation  and a desire to support local farmers and the local economy are some of the elements driving this trend.Growing Demand for Specialty Crops like Herbs and MicrogreensOne of the important factors driving the commercial greenhouse industry is the rising demand for specialty crops like herbs and microgreens. Specialty crops are usually expensive plants that are used sparingly but are in high demand among consumers and chefs. Herbs  microgreens  edible flowers  and other unusual plants can be grown as part of these crops.Specialty crops can be grown in commercial greenhouses because they offer a controlled environment that can be tailored to meet the needs of each crop. For instance  some herbs and microgreens need extremely precise temperature and light conditions to flourish  which can be challenging in outdoor growing areas. In addition  commercial greenhouses can provide a year-round supply of specialty crops  which can be difficult to source locally during the off-season. This allows growers to capture premium prices for their crops and can help support the development of local food systems and regional cuisines.Download Exclusive Sample of Reporthttps://www.visiongain.com/report/commercial-greenhouse-market-2023/#download_sampe_divWhere are the Market Opportunities?Expansion into New MarketsCompanies are aiming to expand their operations to new places in order to tap into new markets and meet the growing need for fresh and sustainable food as a result of this demand.

If such study would not start before 31 May 2023  Phebra could terminate the license agreement unless the parties agree to postpone such date. The license agreement grant is now subject to Medsenic’s ability to commence a clinical study using OATO before 31 May 2024.In addition  BioSenic Group and Phebra are currently analyzing the possibility to extend the Medsenic Territories and the commercial terms thereof.“We are particularly satisfied of the excellent degree of coordination between Phebra and Medsenic  aimed at delivering the clinical batches for entering into the realization of the expected Phase 3 trial of the oral medication  related to the previously agreed on exclusive license between Phebra and Medsenic ” said Prof. François Rieger  PhD  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of BioSenic. “Both recent technical advances for the oral ATO clinical supply and the newly agreed amendment to the original license will help render possible a quick FDA approval  through a necessary IND submission  followed by the expected activation of centers and patients recruitment.”About PhebraPhebra  an Australian owned manufacturer  is committed to providing skills development and employment opportunities in the fields of research and development and production of commercial products for both local and export markets. Phebra is an equal opportunity employer of more than 120 people and supports the health of Australians by supplying over 65 medicines in critical therapeutic areas. Together with manufacturing medicines  Phebra collaborates with hospitals in developing sought after therapeutic solutions. It partners with companies to bring critical medicines into Australia. Phebra also supplies and out-licences products globally across the Pacific region  Asia  Europe  Canada  South Americas and the Middle East.About BioSenicBioSenic is a leading biotech company specializing in the development of clinical assets issued from: (i)  the allogeneic cell therapy platform ALLOB and (ii) the Arsenic TriOxide (ATO) platform. Key target indications for the platforms include Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD)  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) and high-risk tibial fractures.Following the merger in October 2022  BioSenic combines the strategic positionings and strengths of Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics. The merger also enables Biosenic to add to its innovative cell therapy platform and strong IP for tissue repair protection with an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/OATO.BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About BioSenic technology platformsBioSenic’s technology is based on two main platforms:1) The allogeneic cell and gene therapy platform  developed by BioSenic with differentiated bone marrow sourced Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) that can be stored at the point of use in hospitals. Its current investigational medicinal product  ALLOB  represents a unique  proprietary approach to organ repair and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells on the site of injury after a single local injection. These cells are produced via a BioSenic's scalable manufacturing process. Following the CTA approval by regulatory authorities in Europe  BioSenic has initiated patient recruitment for the Phase IIb clinical trial with ALLOB in patients with difficult tibial fractures  using its optimized production process. ALLOB is currently being evaluated in a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase IIb study in patients with high-risk tibial fractures  using its optimized production process  after a successful first safety and efficacy study (Phase 1/2a) on fractured long bones  with late delayed union. The patient recruitment has been halted late February 2023 with 57 patients and the new rules permitted for statistical analysis should allow BioSenic to get the main results of this trial much earlier than anticipated in the original protocol  since they are expected by mid-2023.2) The Arsenic TriOxide (ATO) platform developed by Medsenic. The immunomodulatory properties of ATO have demonstrated a double basic effect on cells of the immune system. The first effect is the increase of the cell oxidative stress in activated B  T or other cells of the innate/adaptative immune system to the point they will enter a cell death program (apoptosis) and be eliminated. The second effect is potent immunomodulatory properties on several pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in inflammatory or autoimmune cell pathways. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. GvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). GvHD is primarily mediated by the transplanted immune system that can lead to severe multiorgan damage. Medsenic had been successful in a Phase II trial with its intravenous formulation  allowing arsenic trioxide to be granted an orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA and is heading towards an international Phase III confirmatory study  with a new  IP protected  oral (OATO) formulation. Moderate to Severe forms of Systemic Lupus erythematosus (SLE) is another selected target  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastro-intestinal tract) in a Phase IIa study.Systemic Sclerosis is  in addition  part of the clinical pipeline of BioSenic. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive. This gives good grounds to launch a Phase II clinical protocol for this serious disease that badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and with no actual current effective treatment.In addition  BioSenic is developing an off-the-shelf next-generation improved viscosupplement  JTA-004  consisting of a unique combination of plasma proteins  hyaluronic acid - a natural component of knee synovial fluid  and a fast-acting analgesic. JTA-004 intends to provide added lubrication and protection to the cartilage of the arthritic joint and to alleviate osteoarthritic pain (OA) and inflammation. In March 2023  after the identification of new OA subtypes  BioSenic delivered a new post-hoc analysis of its Phase III JTA-004 trial on knee OA with positive action on the most severely affected patient population. This new post-hoc analysis changes the therapeutic profile of the molecule and potentially allows for the possibility of stratifying patients for a new  optimized Phase III clinical study. BioSenic  which does not intend to allocate R&D resources to support the clinical development of JTA-004 and will continue to focus its R&D activities on the development of its autoimmune (ATO) and cell therapy (ALLOB) platforms  is now seeking to collaborate with existing and potential partners to explore options for the future development of JTA-004 based on this new post-hoc analysis.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAPr.

If such study would not start before 31 May 2023  Phebra could terminate the license agreement unless the parties agree to postpone such date. The license agreement grant is now subject to Medsenic’s ability to commence a clinical study using OATO before 31 May 2024.In addition  BioSenic Group and Phebra are currently analyzing the possibility to extend the Medsenic Territories and the commercial terms thereof.“We are particularly satisfied of the excellent degree of coordination between Phebra and Medsenic  aimed at delivering the clinical batches for entering into the realization of the expected Phase 3 trial of the oral medication  related to the previously agreed on exclusive license between Phebra and Medsenic ” said Prof. François Rieger  PhD  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of BioSenic. “Both recent technical advances for the oral ATO clinical supply and the newly agreed amendment to the original license will help render possible a quick FDA approval  through a necessary IND submission  followed by the expected activation of centers and patients recruitment.”About PhebraPhebra  an Australian owned manufacturer  is committed to providing skills development and employment opportunities in the fields of research and development and production of commercial products for both local and export markets. Phebra is an equal opportunity employer of more than 120 people and supports the health of Australians by supplying over 65 medicines in critical therapeutic areas. Together with manufacturing medicines  Phebra collaborates with hospitals in developing sought after therapeutic solutions. It partners with companies to bring critical medicines into Australia. Phebra also supplies and out-licences products globally across the Pacific region  Asia  Europe  Canada  South Americas and the Middle East.About BioSenicBioSenic is a leading biotech company specializing in the development of clinical assets issued from: (i)  the allogeneic cell therapy platform ALLOB and (ii) the Arsenic TriOxide (ATO) platform. Key target indications for the platforms include Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD)  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) and high-risk tibial fractures.Following the merger in October 2022  BioSenic combines the strategic positionings and strengths of Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics. The merger also enables Biosenic to add to its innovative cell therapy platform and strong IP for tissue repair protection with an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/OATO.BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About BioSenic technology platformsBioSenic’s technology is based on two main platforms:1) The allogeneic cell and gene therapy platform  developed by BioSenic with differentiated bone marrow sourced Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) that can be stored at the point of use in hospitals. Its current investigational medicinal product  ALLOB  represents a unique  proprietary approach to organ repair and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells on the site of injury after a single local injection. These cells are produced via a BioSenic's scalable manufacturing process. Following the CTA approval by regulatory authorities in Europe  BioSenic has initiated patient recruitment for the Phase IIb clinical trial with ALLOB in patients with difficult tibial fractures  using its optimized production process. ALLOB is currently being evaluated in a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase IIb study in patients with high-risk tibial fractures  using its optimized production process  after a successful first safety and efficacy study (Phase 1/2a) on fractured long bones  with late delayed union. The patient recruitment has been halted late February 2023 with 57 patients and the new rules permitted for statistical analysis should allow BioSenic to get the main results of this trial much earlier than anticipated in the original protocol  since they are expected by mid-2023.2) The Arsenic TriOxide (ATO) platform developed by Medsenic. The immunomodulatory properties of ATO have demonstrated a double basic effect on cells of the immune system. The first effect is the increase of the cell oxidative stress in activated B  T or other cells of the innate/adaptative immune system to the point they will enter a cell death program (apoptosis) and be eliminated. The second effect is potent immunomodulatory properties on several pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in inflammatory or autoimmune cell pathways. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. GvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). GvHD is primarily mediated by the transplanted immune system that can lead to severe multiorgan damage. Medsenic had been successful in a Phase II trial with its intravenous formulation  allowing arsenic trioxide to be granted an orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA and is heading towards an international Phase III confirmatory study  with a new  IP protected  oral (OATO) formulation. Moderate to Severe forms of Systemic Lupus erythematosus (SLE) is another selected target  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastro-intestinal tract) in a Phase IIa study.Systemic Sclerosis is  in addition  part of the clinical pipeline of BioSenic. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive. This gives good grounds to launch a Phase II clinical protocol for this serious disease that badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and with no actual current effective treatment.In addition  BioSenic is developing an off-the-shelf next-generation improved viscosupplement  JTA-004  consisting of a unique combination of plasma proteins  hyaluronic acid - a natural component of knee synovial fluid  and a fast-acting analgesic. JTA-004 intends to provide added lubrication and protection to the cartilage of the arthritic joint and to alleviate osteoarthritic pain (OA) and inflammation. In March 2023  after the identification of new OA subtypes  BioSenic delivered a new post-hoc analysis of its Phase III JTA-004 trial on knee OA with positive action on the most severely affected patient population. This new post-hoc analysis changes the therapeutic profile of the molecule and potentially allows for the possibility of stratifying patients for a new  optimized Phase III clinical study. BioSenic  which does not intend to allocate R&D resources to support the clinical development of JTA-004 and will continue to focus its R&D activities on the development of its autoimmune (ATO) and cell therapy (ALLOB) platforms  is now seeking to collaborate with existing and potential partners to explore options for the future development of JTA-004 based on this new post-hoc analysis.",neutral,0.0,0.99,0.0,mixed,0.6,0.16,0.24,True,English,"['current license agreement', 'BioSenic', 'update', 'Phebra', 'randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase IIb study', 'Prof. François Rieger', 'current investigational medicinal product', 'Phase IIb clinical trial', 'allogeneic cell therapy platform', 'innovative cell therapy platform', 'Graft Versus Host Disease', 'oral ATO clinical supply', 'gene therapy platform', 'leading Australian developer', 'Chief Executive Officer', 'recent technical advances', 'necessary IND submission', 'equal opportunity employer', 'leading biotech company', 'high-risk tibial fractures', 'Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park', 'unique, proprietary approach', 'difficult tibial fractures', 'successful first safety', 'late delayed union', 'clinical stage company', 'other licensing terms', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'quick FDA approval', 'Key target indications', 'scalable manufacturing process', 'tissue repair protection', 'two main platforms', 'differentiated bone marrow', 'optimized production process', 'Mesenchymal Stromal Cells', 'undifferentiated stromal cells', 'Australian owned manufacturer', 'critical therapeutic areas', 'single local injection', 'OATO Phase III', 'CNS inflammatory diseases', 'Phebra Pty Ltd', 'license agreement grant', 'ATO) platform', 'Phase 3 trial', 'BioSenic technology platforms', 'cell repair', 'clinical study', 'supply agreement', 'innovative pharmaceuticals', 'clinical batches', 'clinical assets', 'oral formulation', 'oral medication', 'efficacy study', 'following indications', 'Systemic Sclerosis', 'commercial terms', 'therapeutic solutions', 'CTA approval', 'infectious diseases', 'Bone Therapeutics', 'organ repair', 'bone regeneration', 'bone-forming cells', 'manufacturing medicines', 'critical medicines', 'potential renegotiation', 'Euronext Brussels', 'serious autoimmune', 'high quality', 'arsenic trioxide', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'excellent degree', 'exclusive license', 'original license', 'expected activation', 'employment opportunities', 'commercial products', 'export markets', 'Pacific region', 'South Americas', 'Middle East', 'strategic positionings', 'strong IP', 'new arsenal', 'various anti-inflammatory', 'anti-autoimmune formulations', 'immunomodulatory properties', 'Further information', 'healthy donors', 'regulatory authorities', 'patient recruitment', 'long bones', 'patients recruitment', 'skills development', 'Medsenic SAS', 'Medsenic Territories', 'BioSenic Group', 'Phebra OATO', '65 medicines', 'Maintenance', 'launch', 'May', 'Parties', 'Mont-Saint-Guibert', 'Belgium', '7.00am', 'Paris', 'amendment', 'affiliate', 'supplier', 'marketing', 'GvHD', 'SLE', 'COVID-19', 'date', 'ability', 'addition', 'possibility', 'coordination', 'realization', 'PhD', 'Chairman', 'centers', 'fields', 'research', '120 people', 'Australians', 'hospitals', 'companies', 'Asia', 'Europe', 'Canada', 'ALLOB', 'SSc', 'merger', 'October', 'strengths', 'ATO/OATO', 'MSCs', 'point', 'use', 'site', 'injury', 'bee']",2023-05-30,2023-05-30,pharmiweb.com
