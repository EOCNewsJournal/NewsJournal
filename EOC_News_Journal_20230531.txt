The company's oncology-focusedpipeline is designed to act on the tumor microenvironment (TME) and the cancer immunity cycle by breaking tumor protection barriers against the immune system and blocking tumor repair. By neutralizing chemokines in the TME  TME Pharma's approach works in combination with other forms of treatment to weaken tumor defenses and enable greater therapeutic impact. In the GLORIA clinical trial  TME Pharma is studying its lead drug candidate NOX-A12in newly diagnosed brain cancer patients who will not benefit clinically from standard chemotherapy. TME Pharma has delivered top-linedata from the NOX-A12three dose-escalationcohorts combined with radiotherapy of the GLORIA clinical trial  observing consistent tumor reductions and objective tumor responses. Additionally  GLORIA expansion arms evaluate safety and efficacy of NOX-A12in other combinations where the interim results from the triple combination of NOX-A12 radiotherapy and bevacizumab suggest even deeper and more durable responses. NOX-A12 in combination with radiotherapy has received orphan drug designation for glioblastoma in the United States and glioma in Europe. TME Pharma has delivered final top-linedata with encouraging overall survival and safety profile from its NOX-A12combination trial with Keytruda® in metastatic colorectal and pancreatic cancer patients  which was published in the Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer in October 2021. The company has entered in its second collaboration with MSD/Merck for its Phase 2 study  OPTIMUS  to further evaluate safety and efficacy of NOX-A12in combination with Merck's Keytruda® and two different chemotherapy regimens as second-linetherapy in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. The design of the trial has been approved in France and Spain and is in discussion with regulatory authorities in the United States. The company's second clinical-stagedrug candidate  NOX-E36 is designed to target the innate immune system. TME Pharma is considering several solid tumors for further clinical development.

The two clearing institutions are interconnected to provide registration ,"Illustration: Chen Xia/Global TimesThe first yuan-denominated ""Yulan Bond "" issued by the Bank of China through its Macao branch  has been successfully registered with the Shanghai Clearing House on Tuesday  according to the clearing institution's website.In December 2020  the Shanghai Clearing House and Brussels-based Euroclear Bank announced the Yulan Bond  named after Shanghai's city flower  the magnolia. The two clearing institutions are interconnected to provide registration  custody  and settlement services  making the bonds a bridge connecting Chinese issuers with overseas investors.Over the past few years  bond denominations have mainly been in US dollars and euros. This is the first time the bond has been issued with the Chinese yuan. Economic observers believe that the issuance of yuan-denominated Yulan Bond offers an opportunity to push forward the internationalization of China's yuan.On one hand  the yuan-denominated Yulan Bond provides a new option for Chinese domestic enterprises to issue bonds in the international market  which will further expand the financing channels for Chinese companies.On the other hand  with the interconnection of financial services between China and Europe  the Yulan Bond provides global investors with high-quality yuan-denominated assets  which will help promote the circulation of yuan in global securities investment.According to media reports  the Yulan Bond is registered with Shanghai Clearing House  which serves the Chinese interbank bond market. However  global investors settle the securities within Euroclear's network and thus do not need to understand the Chinese settlement system.Currently  as the strong dollar has become a hazard for the global economy  economies across the world have realized the urgency of de-dollarization. Admittedly  although the US dollar will continue to be the main currency in which countries hold their foreign exchange reserves and carry out international trade  a global trend toward de-dollarization has already begun.However  the current global financial supply chains are a complex network  in which factors such as a US dollar-centered global payment system and the immature investment pool for non-dollar-denominated securities are big obstacles to de-dollarization. We need to overcome these obstacles step by step.Against the backdrop of countries around the world cutting their usage of the US dollar  the Chinese yuan is increasingly being used in global trade. The yuan's primary feature is to serve the real economy  and its internationalization began during China's economic globalization. Market players have generated a demand for stable cross-border use.However  as the Chinese yuan's internationalization advances  and the yuan circulating in the international economic system continues to increase  more attention should be paid to establishing a more mature investment market for the yuan. This can be achieved by providing more yuan-denominated financial products to expand investment channels for the yuan circulating in the global economic system and to further promote the yuan's internationalization.Shanghai Clearing House has stated on its website that the issuance of yuan-denominated Yulan Bond is another practice of promoting the internationalization of the yuan. Bank of China issued 2 billion yuan ($282 million) worth of Yulan Bond with a tenor of two years  which were 2.92 times oversubscribed. The bond has attracted investors from countries including Japan  Malaysia  Singapore  the UK  Switzerland  and France  emphasizing the attractiveness of yuan-denominated assets in the global securities market.As primary and secondary bond markets in China have been opened to international investors in recent years  the offshore market has also become a main venue for overseas investors to trade or invest in bonds issued by Chinese institutions. We believe that the Chinese-issued yuan bond market will thrive  and the vision will become increasingly clear  serving as a big step for the internationalization of the Chinese currency.The author is a reporter with the Global Times. bizopinion@globaltimes.com.cn",neutral,0.36,0.64,0.0,negative,0.0,0.15,0.85,True,English,"['Yulan Bond', 'high-quality assets', 'yuan', 'internationalization', 'current global financial supply chains', 'US dollar-centered global payment system', 'Chinese interbank bond market', 'Chinese-issued yuan bond market', 'foreign exchange reserves', 'stable cross-border use', 'yuan-denominated financial products', 'immature investment pool', 'global economic system', 'mature investment market', 'Shanghai Clearing House', 'secondary bond markets', 'Chinese domestic enterprises', 'Chinese settlement system', 'international economic system', 'high-quality yuan-denominated assets', 'global securities market', 'two clearing institutions', 'denominated Yulan Bond', 'global securities investment', 'Brussels-based Euroclear Bank', 'financial services', 'international market', 'Chinese institutions', 'Market players', 'offshore market', 'Global Times', 'US dollars', 'global economy', 'global trend', 'global trade', 'investment channels', 'first yuan-denominated', 'global investors', 'settlement services', 'Economic observers', 'economic globalization', 'bond denominations', 'Chinese issuers', 'Chinese companies', 'Chinese currency', 'international trade', 'dollar-denominated securities', 'two years', 'international investors', 'Chen Xia', 'Macao branch', 'city flower', 'first time', 'one hand', 'new option', 'financing channels', 'other hand', 'media reports', 'strong dollar', 'main currency', 'real economy', 'main venue', 'Chinese yuan', 'overseas investors', 'recent years', 'complex network', 'big obstacles', 'primary feature', '2 billion yuan', 'big step', 'Illustration', 'China', 'Tuesday', 'website', 'December', 'magnolia', 'registration', 'custody', 'bonds', 'past', 'euros', 'issuance', 'opportunity', 'internationalization', 'interconnection', 'Europe', 'circulation', 'hazard', 'economies', 'world', 'urgency', 'dollarization', 'countries', 'factors', 'backdrop', 'usage', 'demand', 'attention', 'practice', 'tenor', 'Japan', 'Malaysia', 'Singapore', 'UK', 'Switzerland', 'France', 'attractiveness', 'vision', 'author', 'reporter']",2023-05-31,2023-05-31,globaltimes.cn

This order follows the earlier major order from the Indian Defence Force for the delivery of 450 portable methanol fuel cell systems with a volume of more than EUR 16 million  announced on March 6  2023.The stationary fuel cell solutions produce clean electricity and can be used by infantry and special forces units for parallel charging of multiple batteries and for powering sensors  monitoring and communication systems and basic field electrification. Their use is often in remote areas  at high altitudes and under extreme climatic conditions. SFC Energy's variable power solutions are highly reliable  easy to transport  and feature economical consumption of the fuel methanol.The Indian government is increasingly looking to replace fossil fuel-based polluting energy systems such as diesel generators with sustainable energy solutions in order to significantly reduce CO 2 emissions. The order for the stationary fuel cell generators is part of the Indian government's ""Make in India"" initiative.Dr. Peter Podesser  CEO of SFC Energy AG: ""The second major order from the Indian defense forces within a short time along with the establishment of our Indian subsidiary underlines our confidence in the enormous business potential in this market. In addition  the order is a strong signal from the Indian government to reduce CO 2 emissions and a contribution to the announced political measures to promote clean energy solutions  including fuel cells. The production of efficient and low-emission fuel cell solutions will be part of the 'Make in India' initiative. Therefore SFC Energy brings its decades of expertise in fuel cell technology as well as the experience of more than 60 000 worldwide sold fuel cells to support the Indian government in its ambitious climate protection goals  including the 'National Green Hydrogen Mission'. Together with our strategic partner FCT we are working towards the vision of a climate-neutral society and this order also pays off for an ecological  sustainable energy transition.”""The fuel cell generators jointly developed by FC TecNrgy Pvt and SFC Energy are extremely robust and ideally suited for the operations of the Indian Defense Forces. Even under the most difficult environmental and climatic conditions  they provide self-sufficient and reliable power. We are very excited about the second major order from the Indian Army producing the state-of-the-art fuel cells together with SFC Energy in India under the 'Make in India' initiative for self-reliance "" says Colonel (Retd.)

If accepted  Health Canada will provide additional information on the potential approval timeline.This is the second regulatory application for VLA1553 filed by Valneva  and the Company intends to make additional regulatory submissions in 2023. A Biologic License Application (BLA) is currently under priority review1 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) review goal date at the end of August 2023.VLA1553 is currently the only chikungunya vaccine candidate worldwide for which regulatory review processes are underway and  if approved  it could become the first licensed chikungunya vaccine available to address this unmet medical need. It would also represent the third vaccine Valneva has brought from early R&D to approval.Juan Carlos Jaramillo  MD  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  commented  “Chikungunya represents a major threat for people traveling to or living in areas where chikungunya virus and the mosquitos that transmit it are present  including popular destinations for U.S. and Canadian travelers. This threat continues to grow as shown by the recent epidemiological alert of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO)2. No vaccine or specific treatments are currently available for this debilitating disease  and we will continue to work diligently to bring VLA1553 to different territories as soon as possible.”The regulatory submissions with Health Canada and the FDA follow final pivotal Phase 3 data in March 20223  final lot-to-lot consistency results in May 20224 and positive twelve-month persistence data in December 20225. A clinical study of VLA1553 in adolescents is ongoing in Brazil6  for which Valneva reported enrollment and vaccination completion in February 20237. This trial  conducted by Valneva’s partner Instituto Butantan and funded by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI)  may support future regulatory submissions in this age group  if VLA1553 is initially approved in adults  as well as licensure of the vaccine in Europe and Brazil  which would be the first potential approval for use in an endemic population. First results are expected mid-2023.VLA1553 received FDA Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy designations in 2018 and 2021  respectively. The program was also granted PRIority MEdicine (PRIME) designation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2020  and Valneva plans to make regulatory submissions for VLA1553 in Europe in the second half of 2023.About ChikungunyaChikungunya is a mosquito-borne viral disease caused by the chikungunya virus (CHIKV)  a Togaviridae virus  transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Infection leads to symptomatic disease in 72-92% of humans after four to seven days following the mosquito bite. While mortality with CHIKV is low  morbidity is high  and the global market for vaccines against chikungunya is estimated to exceed $500 million annually by 20328. Clinical symptoms include acute onset of fever  debilitating joint and muscle pain  headache  nausea  rash and chronic arthralgia. Chikungunya virus often causes sudden large outbreaks with high attack rates  affecting one-third to three-quarters of the population in areas where the virus is circulating. The high-risk areas of infection for travelers are places where chikungunya virus-carrying mosquitos are endemic  including the Americas  parts of Africa  and Southeast Asia  and the virus has spread to more than 110 countries9. As of July 2022  more than three million cases have been reported in the Americas10 and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow as the CHIKV primary mosquito vectors continue to spread geographically. There are no preventive vaccines or effective treatments available and  as such  chikungunya is considered to be a major public health threat.About VLA1553VLA1553 is a live-attenuated  single dose investigational vaccine candidate targeting the chikungunya virus  which has spread to over 110 countries11.

The Cboe Small Companies was up 0.4% at 13 616.25.On Sunday  US President Joe Biden and the Republican leader of the House of Representatives  Kevin McCarthy  reached a tentative agreement  after weeks of negotiations.The basic framework of the deal lifts the federal debt ceiling  which is currently USD31.4 trillion  for two years  enough to get past the next presidential election in 2024.The bill faces opposition from the progressive and hard-right wings of the Democratic and Republican parties  respectively. It will be voted on on Wednesday this week.""A deal may have been done between President Biden and Republican Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy  but there was still a sense of unease around the US debt ceiling as markets await sign-off from Congress "" said AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould.""Disquiet from various wings of the Democratic and Republican parties was enough to suggest that the agreement cannot be declared a slam dunk just yet  even if an eventual sign-off is by far the likeliest outcome.""Stocks in New York were called higher  as they reopened from the Memorial Day holiday weekend. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was called up 0.2%  the S&P 500 index up 0.6%  and the Nasdaq Composite up 1.2%.In Europe  economic sentiment in the eurozone took a hit in May  according to Eurostat survey data released on Tuesday. The economic sentiment indicator fell to 96.5 points in May from 99.0 in April.Industry confidence continued to weaken  with a deterioration of managers' production expectations and assessments of current order books.""The eurozone likely saw negative growth over the winter. Economic sentiment in May unfortunately does not suggest that a vibrant recovery is underway. Weak growth and a falling inflation outlook both add to expectations that the peak in ECB rates is getting near "" ING commented.On Thursday  the European Central Bank's meeting minutes will be released.At the start of May  the ECB had slowed the pace of its interest rate increases. The 25-basis-point hike took the interest rate on the main refinancing operations  the interest rate on the marginal lending facility  and the deposit facility to 3.75%  4.00% and 3.25%.In European equities on Tuesday  the CAC 40 index in Paris was down 0.3%  while the DAX 40 in Frankfurt was up 0.6%.The dollar was weaker.The pound was quoted at USD1.2422 at midday on Tuesday in London  up compared to USD1.2325 at the London equities close on Friday.

The company’s unique offer in the biomanufacturing process spans all stages of clinical development  marketing and product lifecycle The proposed transaction would value Skyepharma at an enterprise value of circa. €50 million and an equity value of circa. €52 million. eureKING would acquire  for cash  circa. 58.1% of the share capital (on a fully-diluted basis) of Oleron Pharma which holds 100% of the share capital of Skyepharma. The remaining circa. 41.9% would be contributed by the main shareholders of Oleron Pharma to eureKING  who would be subject to a lock-up undertaking post closing. eureKING intends to finance the €30.2 million purchase price for the shares acquired in cash through commitments of certain existing shareholders of eureKING not to redeem their Market Shares1 ahead of the completion of the transaction  and/or additional equity funding raised from existing shareholders and/or new investors through a private placement conducted ahead of the closing of the transaction. The proposed transaction would represent the first cornerstone of eureKING’s project to pursue bolt-on acquisitions to add innovative companies from the fast-growing biotherapies CDMO segment to its platform to create a bio-CDMO leader and which could result in additional transactions. These transactions may be announced before the completion of the proposed transaction.Paris and Saint-Quentin-Fallavier  France  May 30  2023 – eureKING (ISIN: FR0014009ON9  Euronext Paris)  the first European special purpose acquisition company (“SPAC”) in healthcare dedicated to bioproduction  today announced that it has signed  on May 25  2023  a put option agreement for 100% of the share capital of Oleron Pharma  the 100% holding company of Skyepharma. Skyepharma is an innovative and fully integrated French CDMO player with 20 years of innovation and development experience in drug development and delivery of oral technologies. This follows eureKING’s announcement on May 16  2023  that it had submitted a firm offer on the basis of which it has been granted an exclusivity period with a view to acquiring Skyepharma.The proposed transaction would represent the first cornerstone of eureKING’s project to pursue bolt-on acquisitions to add innovative companies from the fast-growing biotherapies CDMO segment to its platform to create a bio-CDMO leader. eureKING has a clear and identified roadmap to bolster Skyepharma’s technology platform to consolidate the highly fragmented European market in biomanufacturing capacity  such as state-of-the-art facilities to manufacture cell and gene therapies in Europe. This could result in additional transactions being pursued by eureKING. These transactions may be announced even before the completion of the proposed transaction.The proposed transaction would constitute the “Initial Business Combination” (or “IBC”)  described in the IPO Prospectus of eureKING. It would be completed (i) through the acquisition for cash by eureKING of (x) 55% of the shares of Oleron Pharma held by Mr. David Lescuyer  Mr. Benoit Mougeot  Mr. Xavier Mathiot  Mr. Frédéric Checot  Mr. Laurent Rigaudeau  Mrs. Isabelle Cachard (the “Rollover Shareholders”  who are managers and employees  or former employees of Skyepharma)  and (y) all the bonds with warrants (obligations à bons de souscription d’actions) issued by Oleron Pharma and held by Bpifrance through the Fonds de Renforcement des PME (“Bpifrance”) (the “Acquisition”) 2 and (ii) through the contribution to eureKING by the Rollover Shareholders of their remaining 45% shares of Oleron Pharma (the “Contribution”). After completion of both the Acquisition and the Contribution  Oleron Pharma  and thus Skyepharma  will be fully owned by eureKING.In order to fund the €30.2 million purchase price for the Acquisition  eureKING intends to seek from its existing shareholders’ commitments not to redeem their Market Shares upon completion of the Initial Business Combination  and/or  as needed  to raise additional equity financing from its existing shareholders and/or from new investors  through a private placement of its ordinary shares (a “PIPE” financing).The new ordinary shares to be issued by eureKING as consideration for the Contribution (the “Contribution Shares”) and the new ordinary shares to be issued in the context of the PIPE (the “PIPE Shares”)  will be listed and traded on the Professional Segment (Compartiment Professionnel) of the regulated market of Euronext Paris on the settlement and delivery date of the Initial Business Combination. Two prospectuses will be prepared and submitted to the approval of the AMF for that purpose  one in relation to the Contribution (the “Contribution Prospectus”)  which will be made public at least two weeks ahead of the extraordinary shareholders’ meeting of eureKING called to approve de Contribution  and one in relation to the PIPE (the “PIPE Prospectus”).Upon completion of the IBC  eureKING’s shares will remain listed on the Professional Segment (Compartiment Professionnel) of Euronext Paris. A transfer of listing from the Professional Segment to the General Segment of Euronext Paris is not considered concomitantly with the completion of the Initial Business Combination.This press release does not constitute the “IBC Notice” triggering the redemption period for eureKING’s Market Shares. The “IBC Notice” will be published by eureKING at a later stage (see paragraph 3 “Steps of the Completion of the Initial Business Combination” below).Investors are reminded of the risks relating to eureKING and an investment in eureKING’s securities  as described in the « Risk Factors » section of the IPO Prospectus.1 Presentation of SkyepharmaSkyepharma is a leading French fully integrated CDMO player  capable of offering complete and tailor-made services to clients  from early-stage development projects  scale-up  and technological transfer to industrial manufacturing  including packaging  serialization and aggregation.Skyepharma was created in 1996 and it acquired its current industrial site  in Saint-Quentin-Fallavier  near Lyon in 1997. In 2016  it merged with Vectura  a larger CDMO  until it was spun-off in a management buy-out by the current management  supported by Bpifrance  in 2021.Skyepharma offers a complete and bespoke solution  over the entire value-chain:Early stage: drug formulation conception  small batch production (including batches already compliant with the “good manufacturing practices” regulatory requirements and clinical trial support.Program scale-up: implementation of different quality control processes  increase in the size of the batches being produced  and validation or the batches being produced.Technology transfer: from the lab to the production floor or from another CDMO.Flexible production: capacity to vary the size of the batches and to produce drugs in all available forms (tablets  liquid  powder  etc.)Full packaging options: bottles  vials  capsules  blisters  etc.Supply chain: storage  temperature control  inventory management.Quality control: quality insurance  quality testing  regulatory support.In particular  Skyepharma’s Skyehub Model  launched in 2022  is an innovative solution that can host dedicated and customized biomanufacturing facilities within Skyepharma’s premises  allowing customers to leverage the company’s unique quality system as well as its services and  at the same time  preserve intellectual property. The Skyehub model has had an initial focus on live biotherapeutic products and has recently signed a partnership  in February 2022  with MaâT Pharma  a French  Euronext Paris listed  biotech company  becoming the first company resident of SkyeHub Bioproduction.Skyepharma’s c.22 000 square meter production site and headquarters in Saint-Quentin-Fallavier are set on c.65 000 square meters of land  with therefore ample capacity for extension.Skyepharma is a fast-growing business with an attractive future profitability trajectory. Skyepharma has had revenue growth of more than 140% in the past six years (from €11 million in 2018 to €22 million in 2022)  representing a CAGR from 2019 to 2022 of over 16%. Its operating income (résultat d’exploitation) for the 2022 fiscal year represented a loss of €1.4 million. The total of its balance sheet as of December 31  2022  amounted to €38.6 million and its bank debt (gross) to €1.1 million. The reader’s attention is drawn to the fact that these figures are extracted from Skyepharma’s unaudited  stand alone  French GAAP financial statements. Skyepharma is currently in the process of producing IFRS financial statements for the years 2021 and 2022  which will be included in the Contribution Prospectus and the PIPE Prospectus and  to the extent available at the time  in the IBC Notice. There can be significant differences between French GAAP and IFRS financial statements and therefore caution should be applied when relying on the above French GAAP numbers.The management team  under Mr. David Lescuyer (CEO) and Mr. Benoit Mougeot (CFO)  who led the management buy-out in 2021  was able to turn the loss-making industrial Vectura branch into a successful company.2 Structure of the Initial Business CombinationThe Acquisition would be completed pursuant to a sale and purchase agreement (the “Sale and Purchase Agreement”) to be entered into between eureKING  on the one hand  and the Rollover Shareholders and Bpifrance. As a consideration for the Acquisition  eureKING will pay a €30.2 million purchase price in cash. As consideration for the Contribution  eureKING will issue to the Rollover Shareholders ordinary shares representing a circa. €21.8 million contribution value  bringing the overall consideration for the Initial Business Contribution to circa. €52 million. The Contribution would be completed pursuant to the Sale and Purchase Agreement as well as a contribution agreement to be entered into between eureKING and the Rollover Shareholders (the “Contribution Agreement”).The Sale and Purchase Agreement (appended to the Put Option Agreement signed on 25 May 2023) would provide  inter alia  the following:the proposed transaction would be subject to (i) the prior authorization of the competent authorities with respect to foreign direct investment regulations  and (ii) the approval of the shareholders of eureKING;representations and warranties would be granted by the shareholders of Skyepharma  pursuant to customary terms and conditions for this type of transaction.eureKING has also agreed to cover  up to €300 000 euros  certain costs of the Rollover Shareholders in the event the Initial Business Combination would not be approved by eureKING’s shareholders.As consideration for the Contribution  eureKING will issue circa. 2.18 million Contribution Shares. The value of one Contribution Share for the purpose of determining the exchange ratio would amount to €10.00  representing a circa. €21.8 million contribution value. In due course  Skyepharma and eureKING would file a joint request with the président of the commercial court of Paris to appoint one contribution appraiser (commissaire aux apports)  who would be asked to assess the value of the ordinary shares of Skyepharma to be contributed to eureKING in the context of the Contribution  to confirm that it is not over-valued and that it corresponds at least to the share capital increase of eureKING  increased by the contribution premium and to confirm  in accordance with the AMF recommendation DOC-2020-06  that the exchange rate is fair.The fair market value of Skyepharma resulting from the consideration presented above will not reach at least 75% of the funds raised in the initial public offering of eureKING  i.e. at least €115.4 million  and eureKING will therefore ask its shareholders to waive this requirement  as detailed in paragraph 10 “Proposed changes to the eureKING Articles of Association and terms and conditions of the Market Warrants and Founders’ Warrants”. eureKING believes that  despite not reaching the thresholds  the acquisition of Skyepharma would nevertheless meet all of the other conditions set forth in the IPO prospectus and would be in the best interest of eureKING and its shareholders.The Rollover Shareholders  who hold as of today 100% of the capital of Oleron Pharma  would sell 55% of their 515 300 Oleron Pharma shares (for an overall €26.6 million cash consideration)  and contribute the remaining 45% to eureKING. Bpifrance would sell 100% of its €500 000 Oleron Pharma bonds with warrants attached (obligations à bons de souscription d’actions) for a €3.6 million cash consideration.The shares sold and contributed by the Rollover Shareholders and the bonds with warrants attached sold by Bpifrance will represent 100% of the share capital of Oleron Pharma on a fully diluted basis. Oleron Pharma itself holds 100% of the share capital of Skyepharma. The bonds with warrants (OBSA) are the only other equity/equity-linked securities issued by Oleron Pharma and Skyepharma.The implementation of the Initial Business Combination will require convening a shareholders’ meeting of eureKING to approve  in particular  the Contribution.3 Steps to the Completion of the Initial Business CombinationFollowing the execution of the Put Option Agreement on May 25  2023  Skyepharma will initiate the required information consultation procedure with its workers’ council. This can take up to four weeks  or eight if the workers’ council requires the appointment of an expert to assist the council in its appreciation of the Initial Business Combination. In parallel  the parties will initiate the foreign investment control procedure with the French ministry of finance.Upon completion of the workers’ council information-consultation procedure and subject to the exercise of the Put Option  which is conditional upon the approval by the shareholders of eureKING of certain amendments to the by-laws of eureKING required to complete the proposed transaction (see paragraph 10: “Proposed changes to the eureKING Articles of Association and terms and conditions of the Market Warrants and Founders’ Warrants” below)  the Initial Business Combination will be formally submitted to eureKING’s Board of Directors. As described in the IPO Prospectus  this will require the approval of two-thirds of its independent members. The Board of Directors has already reviewed the proposed transaction on April 20  2023  and has unanimously approved the execution of the Put Option Agreement on May 25  2023.The Sale and Purchase Agreement and the Contribution Agreement will then be executed and eureKING will publish the “IBC Notice” as this term is defined in the IPO Prospectus3. The publication of the IBC notice will trigger the start of the 30 days redemption period during which the holders of Market Shares of eureKING will be able to request the redemption of their shares. The results of the redemption procedure will be published as soon as available.The Contribution Prospectus will then be submitted to the approval of the Autorité des Marchés Financiers. It will be published at least two weeks before the extraordinary shareholders’ meeting of eureKING that will have to be convened to approve the Contribution.The closing of the Initial Business Combination will take place as soon as possible after this extraordinary shareholders’ meeting. The PIPE Prospectus will be submitted to the approval of the Autorité des Marchés Financiers and published on or before the closing.Within 30 calendar days after the closing  the holders of the Market Shares who will have requested the redemption of their shares will receive €10.30 per market share.A detailed calendar of the steps to the completion of the Initial Business Combination will be included in the IBC Notice  but it is currently expected that the closing of the Initial Business Combination would occur on or about August 31  2023 (subject to the extension of the current deadline by which the Initial Business Combination has to be completed – see paragraph 10: “Proposed changes to the eureKING Articles of Association and terms and conditions of the Market Warrants and Founders’ Warrants”).4 Financial informationThe financial information regarding Skyepharma presented above is extracted from its unaudited French GAAP financial statements. Skyepharma is currently in the process of producing IFRS financial statements for the years 2021 and 2022. These financial statements  together with pro forma financial statements on eureKING reflecting the situation following the completion of the Initial Business Combination  will be included in the Contribution Prospectus and the PIPE Prospectus and  to the extent available at the time  in the IBC Notice. Risk Factors relating to eureKING following the Initial Business Combination and the Initial Business Combination itself will be outlined in the IBC Notice and spelled out in the Contribution Prospectus and the PIPE Prospectus.5 Conflicts of interestThe Initial Business Combination with Skyepharma does not give rise to the type of conflict of interest between eureKING  the Founders4 and their affiliates that would require the implementation of the conflicts of interest management procedures described in “Provision relating to conflict of interests” on pages 117-118 of the IPO Prospectus. In particular  in this context  no fairness opinion on the Initial Business Combination will be sought by the Board of Directors.6 Share capital of eureKING structure after completion of the Initial Business CombinationAs of the date of this press release  the share capital of eureKING is composed of the following securities:15 000 000 Market Shares Convertible into ordinary shares of eureKING upon completion of the Initial Business Combination 5 million Founders’ Shares (Class A1  A2 and A3) Progressively convertible into ordinary shares of eureKING upon completion of the Initial Business Combination as further detailed below. 15 million Market Warrants Exercisable for ordinary shares of eureKING (two warrants for one share) at an €11.50 strike price upon completion of the Initial Business Combination and for a period of five years.Redeemable by eureKING at €0.01 if the eureKING share price attains €18.00  unless previously exercised by their holders after the publication of eureKING’s decision to redeem. eureKING can also exercise its redemption right at €0.01 when the eureKING share price is between €11.50 and 18.00  but the warrants are then exercisable for a higher number of eureKING ordinary shares  reflecting the value of the option embedded into the warrants. 897 000 Founders’ Warrants Identical to the Market Warrants  but for the redemption features.Upon completion of the Initial Business Combination  all the Class A1 preferred shares issued by eureKING (representing 50% of all Founders’ Shares) and all the Market Shares (other than  in respect of the Market Shares  those for which eureKING will have received a request for redemption from their holders) will be automatically converted into ordinary shares of eureKING in accordance with the articles of association of eureKING (the “eureKING Articles of Association”) and the IPO Prospectus. Such ordinary shares of eureKING will be admitted to trading on the Professional Segment (Compartiment Professionnel) of the regulated market of Euronext Paris.It is specified that the outstanding Class A2 shares and Class A3 shares issued by eureKING (each class representing 25% of all Founders’ Shares) will not be converted into ordinary shares upon completion of the Initial Business Combination  but shall be converted into ordinary shares of eureKING in accordance with and under the terms and conditions provided for in the eureKING Articles of Association:each Class A2 share is convertible into one ordinary share of eureKING if  as from the date of completion of the Initial Business Combination  the volume weighted average price of the ordinary shares for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading day period exceeds €12.00 each Class A3 share is convertible into one ordinary share of eureKING if  as from the date of completion of the Initial Business Combination  the volume weighted average price of the ordinary shares for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading day period exceeds €14.00.Until their conversion into ordinary shares  the Class A2 and Class A3 shares will not be listed.The terms and conditions of the Class A2 and Class A3 shares do not provide for any conversion mechanism should the price of the ordinary shares not attain the €12.00 or €14.00 thresholds after a certain time. Therefore  should the share price of the ordinary shares of eureKING permanently remain below these thresholds  these two classes of preferred shares will remain outstanding until the shareholders of eureKING and the holders of the Class A2 and Class A3 shares decide to modify their terms and conditions to that effect. This is not currently contemplated. Further  these Class A2 and Class A3 are subject to a lock-up until their potential conversion into ordinary shares (see also paragraph 8: “Lock-ups undertakings“).7 Shareholding of eureKING before and after the completion of the Initial Business CombinationThe current shareholding of eureKING is as follows:Shareholders Founders’ Shares % Market Shares % Total % Michael Kloss 270 266 5 41% 69 000 0 46% 339 266 1 70% Gérard Le Fur 270 266 5 41% 69 000 0 46% 339 266 1 70% Alexandre Mouradian 270 266 5 41% 0 0 270 266 1 35% Christophe Jean 27 026 0 54% 0 0 27 026 0 14% Hubert Olivier 27 026 0 54% 6 900 0 05% 33 926 0 17% Rodolphe Besserve 27 026 0 54% 6 900 0 05% 33 926 0 17% eureKARE 2 012 349 40 25% 428 026 2 85% 2 440 375 12 20% Total Initial Founders 2 904 225 58 08% 579 826 3 87% 3 484 051 17 42% VTT Fund Ltd 919 228 18 38% 592 639 3 95% 1 511 867 7 56% Aroma Health AG 656 592 13 13% 423 313 2 82% 1 079 905 5 40% Lagfin S.C.A.

The shareholders committing not to redeem their Market Shares could be among the Cornerstone Investors listed above  or could be other holders of Market Shares. The same applies to the existing shareholders providing additional equity financing  if any. Finally  the amount of financing coming from new investors is unknown. Further  eureKING will need to raise financing to finance its operations after completion of the Initial Business Combination  including in the context of the bolt-on acquisitions referred to above and which could result in additional announcements even before the completion of the Initial Business Combination.As indicated in the IPO Prospectus  in the case of an Initial Business Combination:(i) The Initial Founders have committed not to redeem their 579 826 Market Shares. Therefore it’s an amount of €5 798 260 (579 826 Market Shares at €10.00) which will remain in the Secured Deposit Accounts into which the proceeds of the issuance of the Market Shares were deposited.5(ii) The Cornerstone Investors  on their end  retain the possibility to redeem their 2 351 174 Market Shares  but have agreed to forego the €0 30 redemption premium that other holders of Market Shares would be entitled to upon redemption. Therefore  an amount of €705 352.20 (2 351 174 Market Shares at €0.30) will remain in the Secured Deposit Accounts into which the proceeds of the issuance of the Market Shares were deposited if the Cornerstone Investors were to redeem their Market Shares.However  assuming that commitments not to redeem (from the Cornerstone Investors and/or other holders of Market Shares – as the Initial Founders have committed no to redeem their Market Shares as described above) would be sufficient to finance the €30.2 million Acquisition purchase price  the redemption of all the Market Shares for which non-redemption commitments would not have been obtained  and that no further equity financing would be needed  the Rollover Shareholders would end-up holding 31.1% of the share capital of eureKING following the completion of the Initial Business Combination.8 Lock-up undertakingsThe Founders have accepted  in the context of the initial public offering of eureKING  to be bound by the following lock-up undertakings:1) Before completion of the Initial Business Combination  the Founders will not be able to transfer their Founders’ Shares  Founders’ Warrants  Market Shares and Market Warrants  except that the Cornerstone Investors retain the possibility to redeem their Market Shares (but at €10 00 each  i.e. without the €0.30 redemption premium applicable to the other Market Shares).2) After completion of the Initial Business Combination:a) the Ordinary Shares to be issued upon conversion of the Founders’ Shares or exercise of the Founders’ Warrants will not be transferable until the earlier of: (a) the first anniversary of the completion of the Initial Business Combination; and (b) the 181st day after the completion of the Initial Business Combination  if and when the volume weighted average price of an ordinary share exceeds €12 for any 20 trading days in any 30 consecutive trading days period (whereby such 20 trading days do not have to be consecutive) during the period commencing on (and including) the completion of the Initial Business Combination and ending on (but excluding) the first anniversary of the completion of the Initial Business Combination;b) the Founders’ Shares not yet converted into Ordinary Shares (Class A2 and Class A3 preference shares)  the Founders’ Warrants not yet exercised and the Market Warrants held by the Founders and not yet exercised  will remain subject to a lock-up undertaking until they are converted or exercised;6 butc) the Ordinary Shares to be issued upon conversion of the Market Shares held by the Founders or upon exercise of the Market Warrants held by the Founders will no longer be subject to any lock-up undertaking.The Rollover Shareholders will enter into lock-up undertakings pursuant to which they have agreed to be bound by a lock-up undertaking identical to that of the Founders described in 2)a) above with respect to the ordinary shares of eureKING they will receive in the context of the Contribution.9 GovernanceFollowing the completion of the IBC  Mr. David Lescuyer  CEO of Skyepharma  will join the Board of Directors of eureKING.The future composition of the Board of Directors after the completion of the Initial Business Combination is not determined yet. Although it is expected that some members of the existing Board of Directors will remain Board members  some may be replaced. Any new appointments  including that of Mr. David Lescuyer  will be decided by the extraordinary shareholders’ meeting that will be called to decide upon the Contribution. The information about the composition of the Board of Directors at that time  including about any new members  will be provided at the latest when this shareholders’ meeting is convened. At any rate  the composition of the Board of Directors will continue to comply with the applicable independence and gender requirements.As indicated in the IPO Prospectus  Mr. Michael Kloss  CEO of eureKING  Mr. Stefan Berchtold  CFO of eureKING  and Mr. Peter Eckenberg  CTO of eureKING  will receive a deferred bonus of  respectively  €800 000  €100 000 and €100 000 in connection with the completion of the Initial Business Combination. The exceptional remuneration of Mr. Michael Kloss described above will only be paid to him after a favourable vote of the shareholders of eureKING convened in an ordinary general meeting in accordance with the provisions of Article L. 22-10-34  II of the French Code de commerce (ex post vote).10 Proposed changes to the eureKING Articles of Association and terms and conditions of the Market Warrants and Founders’ WarrantsAs indicated in the May 16  2023  press release regarding Skyepharma  eureKING intended to propose to its shareholders  to approve the following modifications to the eureKING Articles of Association and to the terms and conditions of the Market Warrants and the Founders’ Warrants:Streamlining the procedures to redeem the Market Shares  namely doing away with the requirement that Market Shares to be redeemed be held in registered form;Extending the deadline to complete the Initial Business Combination from August 13  2023  currently  to October 31 st   2023  so as to ensure that there is enough time to complete the Initial Business Combination; and  2023  so as to ensure that there is enough time to complete the Initial Business Combination; and Waiving the requirement that the fair market value of the target of the Initial Business Combination be at least 75% of the funds raised in the initial public offering of eureKING  i.e. at least €115 4 million  as the fair market value of Skyepharma is below this threshold.eureKING has decided that only the proposal to streamline the procedures to redeem the Market Shares will be put to the vote of the shareholders at the annual shareholders’ meeting to be held on June 30  2023 (and at the special meeting of the holders of Market Shares convened for the same day). The notices of these two meetings have been published in the Bulletin des Annonce Légales Obligatoires on May 26  2023.The proposal to:Extend the deadline to complete the Initial Business Combination from August 13  2023  currently to a later date  so as to ensure that there is enough time to complete the Initial Business Combination; andWaive the requirement that the fair market value of the target of the Initial Business Combination be at least 75% of the funds raised in the initial public offering of eureKING will be put to the vote of the shareholders and of the holders of the Market Shares  Market Warrants  Founders’ Shares and Founders’ Warrants during meetings to be convened at a later date (but in any case before August 13  2023). Further information on the timing of this ad hoc shareholders’ meeting will be published ahead of the annual  June 30  2023 shareholders’ meeting.AdvisorsBNP Paribas and Société Générale are acting as financial advisors to eureKING and Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP and Linklaters LLP are acting as legal advisors to eureKING.Claris Avocats is acting as legal advisor to Skyepharma.About eureKINGFounded in March 2022  eureKING is a French SPAC (Special Purpose Acquisition Company) formed with the aim of acquiring European companies in the field of cutting-edge biomanufacturing  with the ambition of creating a leading bio-CDMO in Europe capable of meeting the growing outsourcing needs of this industry. eureKING has chosen to focus on three highly specialized and strategic segments of the biopharmaceutical industry: the production of biologics  in particular new generations of monoclonal antibodies or complex proteins  the production of cell and gene therapies and the production of live biotherapeutics (with applications in the microbiome).With a €150 million capital raising in May 2022  eureKING is led by an international management team of experienced healthcare industry talent  100% dedicated to the SPAC project and its development strategy. eureKING is supported by a Board of Directors with complementary pharmaceutical and financial expertise to achieve its goal of developing and promoting the promising biomanufacturing sector in Europe on an international scale.eureKING is listed on the professional compartment of Euronext Paris since May 12  2022.www.eureking.comAbout SkyepharmaSKYEPHARMA is an independent French pharmaceutical CDMO  100% owned by its management team and Bpifrance.

The total of the shares and other securities of Oleron Pharma thus sold in the context of the Acquisition would represent 58.1% of the share capital of Oleron Pharma (on a fully diluted basis). In practice  eureKING will purchase the bonds directly and renounce to the exercise of the warrants as eureKING would already hold 100% of the share capital of Oleron Pharma post-closing of the proposed transaction.3 For a description of the future contents of the IBC Notice  see “Information to the public and the Shareholders relating to the Initial Business Combination” in the IPO Prospectus.4 As described in the IPO Prospectus  and namely (i) eureKARE  Mr. Michael Kloss (CEO of eureKING)  Mr. Gérard Le Fur (chairman of the Board of Directors of eureKING)  Mr. Alexandre Mouradian (Chairman and CEO of eureKARE and observer to the Board of Directors of eureKING)  Mr. Christophe Jean  Mr. Hubert Olivier  Mr. Rodolphe Besserve (observer to the Board of Directors of eureKING)(the “Initial Founders”)  and (ii) VTT Fund Ltd  Aroma Health AG  Lagfin S.C.A.

With this acquisition  Rexel will double in size in the Netherlands  making it the Group’s fourth-biggest country.Over more than 50 years  Wasco has built a strong presence on the Dutch HVAC market  which is in the forefront of Europe’s energy transition  driven by national regulations. The conversion from gas boilers to electrical heat pumps has allowed Wasco to post double-digit growth over the past few years and will further support sustainable demand. This acceleration in the energy transition also leads to increasing proximity between the HVAC and electricity markets in the Netherlands  both at installer and distributor level  enabling more cross-selling opportunities.The Wasco acquisition will allow Rexel to benefit from energy-transition related opportunities. Those markets (HVAC in the case of Wasco but also photovoltaic solutions  industrial automation or EV charging solutions)  whose growth is substantially above Rexel’s in other markets  should also bring resiliency as they are driven by corporate agendas to reduce their emissions  as well as government incentive plans. Rexel has already developed a successful HVAC business  concentrated in countries where heating is traditionally electric  such as France.With an enterprise value of €485m  the implied multiple stands at 9.2 times Wasco’s EBITDA or less than 7 times after full realization of the expected synergies  notably including cross-selling opportunities and logistics optimization. The transaction is expected to be accretive in year one to Rexel’s adjusted EBITA margin and EPS as well as value creating in year two  fully in line with the Group’s criteria. The transaction will leave Rexel’s indebtedness ratio significantly below 2 times EBITDAaL on a proforma basis. It is in line with the capital allocation strategy outlined at the 2022 Capital Markets Day and fully compatible with the ongoing share buyback program.The acquisition remains subject to customary conditions including completion of the consultation process of Wasco’s works council and approval by the competition authority  i.e. the European Commission. It is expected to close in the second half of 2023.Guillaume Texier  CEO of Rexel  stated: “With the acquisition of Wasco  we are totally in line with our strategy aiming at seizing electrification and energy transition opportunities. It’s also fully consistent with our purpose  ‘Electrifying solutions that make a sustainable future possible’. The Netherlands is one of the most exciting European markets from an electrification perspective  benefitting from a fast-paced transition from gas  driven by incentives and regulations  notably the ban on gas boilers both in new build and renovation. Wasco is ideally positioned to be an active player in this transition; it is also best-in-class in terms of digitalization. We are excited to start working with the Wasco teams to unleash the great opportunities that the association of both companies in the Netherlands will create. This transaction demonstrates that Rexel continues to carefully select the best development opportunities  accelerating its growth related to electrification in Europe and reinforcing its positioning in the US  through both organic initiatives and small-to mid-size value-creating acquisitions.”ABOUT REXEL GROUPRexel  worldwide expert in the multichannel professional distribution of products and services for the energy world  addresses three main markets: residential  commercial  and industrial.

Initially  the deal involves the delivery of 36 battery packs for the WEVA Antonie 1  the first-ever new-build hydrogen-powered inland vessel. In total  the agreement includes over 10 megawatts of battery capacity.For the delivery of maritime batteries  Ebusco builds on years of experience in large-scale battery and battery management systems (BMS). The first delivery of 36 battery packs and 6 BMS systems accounts for a total capacity of 1 089 kWh  enabling the full substitution of a large diesel generator.The Ebusco Maritime Batteries have obtained maritime certification and are tested for strict requirements  including water tightness and fire safety. Thanks to the usage of LFP technology  the maritime batteries are not only an extremely safe choice but also boast high power density and stability.Proven battery technology for the first-ever new-build hydrogen shipOechies Elektrotechniek will use the first delivery of Ebusco Maritime Batteries to power the first-ever new-build hydrogen-powered barge. Dutch shipbuilder Concordia Damen will build the WEVA Antonie 1 on assignment from Lenten shipping  the vessel will have a length of 135 metres. With a carrying capacity of 3 700 tons  the barge will eventually be used to transport salt between Delfzijl and the port of Rotterdam. The WEVA 1 Antonie will sail for Nobian Industrial Chemicals B.V.Johan van der Sluis  director at Oechies Elektrotechniek  responds: ""The completion of the first-ever new-build hydrogen-powered barge is an important step to make the sector more sustainable. We are excited to partner with other pioneers in the energy transition for the realization of this project. Thanks to Ebusco's longstanding experience in the transition to zero emission buses  we can rely on an experienced and smart partner in the field of battery technology.""Towards clean inland shippingThe order is in line with the recent agreement by the Council and the European Parliament to use renewable and low-carbon fuels to reduce the carbon footprint of the maritime industry. Offering maritime battery systems is thus a logical step in Ebusco's mission to contribute to a better environment by enabling transport ecosystems.Peter Bijvelds  CEO at Ebusco  adds: ""Over the past decade  we have gained extensive experience in the application of batteries amongst heavy energy users. By extending our expertise in battery technology to other industries  we can make an even greater impact on our journey towards zero emission transport.

The company's oncology-focusedpipeline is designed to act on the tumor microenvironment (TME) and the cancer immunity cycle by breaking tumor protection barriers against the immune system and blocking tumor repair. By neutralizing chemokines in the TME  TME Pharma's approach works in combination with other forms of treatment to weaken tumor defenses and enable greater therapeutic impact. In the GLORIA clinical trial  TME Pharma is studying its lead drug candidate NOX-A12in newly diagnosed brain cancer patients who will not benefit clinically from standard chemotherapy. TME Pharma has delivered top-linedata from the NOX-A12three dose-escalationcohorts combined with radiotherapy of the GLORIA clinical trial  observing consistent tumor reductions and objective tumor responses. Additionally  GLORIA expansion arms evaluate safety and efficacy of NOX-A12in other combinations where the interim results from the triple combination of NOX-A12 radiotherapy and bevacizumab suggest even deeper and more durable responses. NOX-A12 in combination with radiotherapy has received orphan drug designation for glioblastoma in the United States and glioma in Europe. TME Pharma has delivered final top-linedata with encouraging overall survival and safety profile from its NOX-A12combination trial with Keytruda® in metastatic colorectal and pancreatic cancer patients  which was published in the Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer in October 2021. The company has entered in its second collaboration with MSD/Merck for its Phase 2 study  OPTIMUS  to further evaluate safety and efficacy of NOX-A12in combination with Merck's Keytruda® and two different chemotherapy regimens as second-linetherapy in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. The design of the trial has been approved in France and Spain and is in discussion with regulatory authorities in the United States. The company's second clinical-stagedrug candidate  NOX-E36 is designed to target the innate immune system. TME Pharma is considering several solid tumors for further clinical development.

Toyota and Sony are the two most influential stocks in the index  which includes over 2 000 companies in all.Nikkei 225: This index is often used as the benchmark for the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Unlike the TOPIX  it is a price-weighted index  like the Dow Jones. As its name suggests  it comprises 225 stocks.Scale and sizeThe Japanese market is the world's fifth-largest in terms of capitalization. It comes after the NYSE  the Nasdaq  the Shanghai Stock Exchange and Euronext.Stock markets by market capitalization as of Q1 2023 (source: Statista)Many large capsAs of May 2023  the Japanese market includes just over 110 stocks with a market capitalization in excess of $10 billion. Twenty of these exceed $50 billion  and four behemoths are above the symbolic $100 billion mark: Keyence  the industrial robot specialist; telecommunications and network services giant Nippon Telegraph and Telephone; and the two international flagships Toyota and Sony.A market dominated by three sectorsThe three most represented sectors among companies with market capitalizations in excess of $10 billion are Technology (22.2%)  Industrials (21.8%) and Consumer Cyclicals (18.4%  but led by Toyota). In the MSCI World  industrial stocks account for just 10.5% of the index. Financial services (11.3%)  healthcare (10.8%) and consumer discretionary (10.3%) round out the most represented sectors. Conversely  energies are almost entirely absent (just two companies)  compared with a weighting of 5.1% in MSCI World. Finally  real estate and basic materials are not major Japanese specialties either.Investing in Japan: Live stocksBuying Japanese equities isn't that simple. The Japanese market  like the Hong Kong market  operates on a quota basis. In this case  a quota of 100 for the Nikkei 225  which means you need to buy at least 100 shares of a given stock to invest.To make matters worse  many stocks have high share prices  which complicates investment. As explained above  the Nikkei 225 is a price-weighted index  so Japanese companies have no interest in driving their share prices down through splits  or risk losing leverage.Based on these explanations  here are two illustrations:SMC Corporation is the company with the most expensive share on the Nikkei 225: JPY 73 590 on May 24  2023. With a minimum shareholding of 100  you'll need to invest a minimum of JPY 7 359 000 to take up a position. Or USD 52 655 at current exchange rates. The entry ticket is high!Z Holdings is one of the most accessible stocks in the index. At JPY 353 apiece  you'll need to pay JPY 35 300 to take a position in Yahoo Japan's parent company. A much more affordable USD 252.This ratio rule may therefore prevent you from investing in certain shares because they are too expensive for an individual investor. This is something to bear in mind. Other potential pitfalls should also be borne in mind:You need a broker who accepts the Japanese market . And  if possible  one with the ability to schedule orders.. And  if possible  one with the ability to schedule orders. You need to be aware of currency risk. We're talking here about the possibility of incurring financial losses due to fluctuations in exchange rates between two currencies when investing in foreign companies. If a American investor decides to invest in Japanese companies  the exchange rate risk may materialize as follows:If an investor buys JPY 10 000 worth of shares at an exchange rate of USD 1 = JPY 140  the invoice will amount to USD 71. If he sells at the same price  but the exchange rate rises to USD 1 = JPY 150 (i.e. the dollar has appreciated)  he will only recoup USD 66. That's currency risk (which also works in the other direction).Investing in Japan: ETFsETFs are a classic alternative for avoiding exposure to a limited number of stocks and broker limits. There are generalist ETFs that simply allow you to gain exposure to this market and track the performance of the main indices in the land of the Samurai.You could opt for :The iShares MSCI Japan UCITS ETF (+10.86%) is a heavyweight in the sector. On the other hand  its fees are slightly higher than those of other ETFs targeting the market.(+10.86%) is a heavyweight in the sector. On the other hand  its fees are slightly higher than those of other ETFs targeting the market. The iShares Nikkei 225 UCITS ETF (+18.34%)  which aims to replicate the NIKKEI 225 index  is denominated in yen.Choosing a currency-hedged ETF could also be an interesting option. In recent years  both the dollar and the euro have risen sharply against the Japanese yen as a result of monetary policies  with the Bank of Japan (BoJ) looking to stimulate the economy.The acceleration in Japanese market performance from March onwards is clearly visible. A trend reinforced by Warren Buffett's statements in an interview with Nikkei on April 11  in which he expressed his wish to increase his investment made in 2020 in the five leading Japanese trading companies  namely Mitsui  Sumitomo  Itochu  Mitsubishi and Marubeni.In addition to the Buffett effect  there are a number of other factors behind the Japanese stock market's renewed popularity. Geopolitics  with the USA and China currently facing economic challenges  is making Japan more attractive to investors. The Bank of Japan's monetary policy remains accommodating for traders  despite higher inflation and the recent change of central bank president.

If accepted  Health Canada will provide additional information on the potential approval timeline.This is the second regulatory application for VLA1553 filed by Valneva  and the Company intends to make additional regulatory submissions in 2023. A Biologic License Application (BLA) is currently under priority review1 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) review goal date at the end of August 2023.VLA1553 is currently the only chikungunya vaccine candidate worldwide for which regulatory review processes are underway and  if approved  it could become the first licensed chikungunya vaccine available to address this unmet medical need. It would also represent the third vaccine Valneva has brought from early R&D to approval.Juan Carlos Jaramillo  MD  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  commented  “Chikungunya represents a major threat for people traveling to or living in areas where chikungunya virus and the mosquitos that transmit it are present  including popular destinations for U.S. and Canadian travelers. This threat continues to grow as shown by the recent epidemiological alert of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO)2. No vaccine or specific treatments are currently available for this debilitating disease  and we will continue to work diligently to bring VLA1553 to different territories as soon as possible.”The regulatory submissions with Health Canada and the FDA follow final pivotal Phase 3 data in March 20223  final lot-to-lot consistency results in May 20224 and positive twelve-month persistence data in December 20225. A clinical study of VLA1553 in adolescents is ongoing in Brazil6  for which Valneva reported enrollment and vaccination completion in February 20237. This trial  conducted by Valneva’s partner Instituto Butantan and funded by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI)  may support future regulatory submissions in this age group  if VLA1553 is initially approved in adults  as well as licensure of the vaccine in Europe and Brazil  which would be the first potential approval for use in an endemic population. First results are expected mid-2023.VLA1553 received FDA Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy designations in 2018 and 2021  respectively. The program was also granted PRIority MEdicine (PRIME) designation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2020  and Valneva plans to make regulatory submissions for VLA1553 in Europe in the second half of 2023.About ChikungunyaChikungunya is a mosquito-borne viral disease caused by the chikungunya virus (CHIKV)  a Togaviridae virus  transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Infection leads to symptomatic disease in 72-92% of humans after four to seven days following the mosquito bite. While mortality with CHIKV is low  morbidity is high  and the global market for vaccines against chikungunya is estimated to exceed $500 million annually by 20328. Clinical symptoms include acute onset of fever  debilitating joint and muscle pain  headache  nausea  rash and chronic arthralgia. Chikungunya virus often causes sudden large outbreaks with high attack rates  affecting one-third to three-quarters of the population in areas where the virus is circulating. The high-risk areas of infection for travelers are places where chikungunya virus-carrying mosquitos are endemic  including the Americas  parts of Africa  and Southeast Asia  and the virus has spread to more than 110 countries9. As of July 2022  more than three million cases have been reported in the Americas10 and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow as the CHIKV primary mosquito vectors continue to spread geographically. There are no preventive vaccines or effective treatments available and  as such  chikungunya is considered to be a major public health threat.About VLA1553VLA1553 is a live-attenuated  single dose investigational vaccine candidate targeting the chikungunya virus  which has spread to over 110 countries11. It has been designed by deleting a part of the chikungunya virus genome.Valneva reported final data from the pivotal Phase 3 trial of VLA1553 in March 202212  final lot-to-lot consistency results in May 202213 and positive twelve-month persistence data in December 202214.If approved  VLA1553 would expand Valneva’s existing commercial vaccines portfolio and as such  Valneva intends to commercialize this vaccine  leveraging its existing manufacturing and commercial operations.To make VLA1553 more accessible to Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMIC)  Valneva and Instituto Butantan in Brazil signed an agreement in January 2021 for the development  manufacturing and marketing of VLA155315. The collaboration falls within the framework of the agreement signed between CEPI and Valneva in July 201916  which provides funding of up to $24.6 million with support from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 program.VLA1553 received FDA Fast Track  Breakthrough Therapy designations and Priority Review in 2018  2021 and 2023  respectively. VLA1553 was also granted PRIority MEdicine (PRIME) designation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2020.About Valneva SEWe are a specialty vaccine company focused on the development  manufacturing and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases.

This is reflected in the results  which represent a 34% growth over the previous year (31% like-for-like) and signal a complete recovery from the downturn provoked by the pandemic. The consolidation of decorating specialist Wicklein  acquired in 2021  contributed €6 million or 6% to the year's top-line growth.The year saw a return to profitability  despite macro-economic pressures from inflation and material scarcity. EBITDA increased 65% to €12.6 million  which led to a net profit of €1 million. This is a significant turnaround from the €2.3 million net loss the previous year  attributable to the company's sharp focus on operational efficiency and inflation management.Financial indebtedness was reduced to €45.9 million  as a result of improved operating cash flow  which amounted to €13 million  against €2.9 million the previous year.Financial highlights(In € 'millions) 2022 2021 Revenue 142.6 106.4 % growth 34% 5% EBITDA 12.6 7.7 EBITDA/Revenue % 8.8% 7.2% Operating result 2.7 (1.0) Net result 1.0 (2.3) Shares 4.4 4.4 Net result per share (in € ) 0.23 (0.54) Net result per share  diluted (in € ) 0.23 (0.54) Cash flow from operating activities 13.0 2.9 Cash flow from investing activities (5.3) (9.0) Cash flow from financing activities (10.4) (3.2)Equity  Group share 35.4 35.0 Borrowings and other financial liabilities 56.8 61.7 Available cash & cash equivalents 10.9 13.6 Net debt 45.9 48.1 Leverage ratio (Net debt/ EBITDA) 3.6x 6.3xEMEA  Quadpack's biggest region  representing 84% of its revenue  reported most of the fiscal year's growth  up 41% compared to the previous year  with strong momentum thanks to sustained business from all key customers across the territory. The APAC region continued to grow steadily at 18% thanks to local partnerships  while the AMEX region maintained the same level as the previous year  in preparation for growth through local manufacturing.New governanceDuring this fiscal period  a new CEO was appointed for the first time since Quadpack was founded  separating the roles of Chairman and CEO according to best practice in governance. Alexandra Chauvigné took the helm in September  to lead the return to profitable growth  leveraging her extensive market knowledge and executive management experience. Her focus has been on financial discipline  improving profitability and cash generation. Tim Eaves remains as Chairman of the Board  while embracing a new role as Chief Impact Officer  to guide the company's sustainable development.Investing in manufacturing close to customersIn preparation for a post-Covid surge in demand  CAPEX focused on Quadpack's production facilities in its core market of Europe. The greater part of the €5.8 million investment concentrated on increased capacity of sustainable plastic and wooden solutions  and the creation of a new decoration centre at its European facilities  as well as the continuation of its digitalisation project  for greater agility and efficiency – all of which will serve the company's long-term growth.Industry 4.0 is being implemented across all facilities  starting at the wood factory in Spain. The new ERP (enterprise resource planning) solution SAP S4/HANA Cloud connects this and other business-critical systems securely in the cloud. The first phase of the SAP S4/HANA went live in December 2021 and 2022 saw the completion of product configuration and the successful roll-out across 3 of the Group's subsidiaries.Complementing the strategic CAPEX allocations  Quadpack's global supply partner network was strengthened in 2022  in line with its aim to provide solutions in the region  for the region. Through its own facilities or those of its partners  Quadpack is preparing to manufacture  decorate and assemble its solutions locally  for a faster time to market and a lower carbon footprint.Accelerating the path to a positive impactQuadpack progressed on its journey towards making a positive impact in 2022  achieving the Ecovadis Gold Medal for the second consecutive year. Driven by its purpose of ‘taking care and giving back for future generations'  Quadpack considers its ESG impact in all areas of its business  not least the products it produces. Aware of the packaging industry's role in generating waste pollution  it bases its product development on hard data. The full catalogue of products was subjected to life-cycle assessments last year  measuring indicators such as water consumption  CO2 footprint  resource depletion and litter potential. The data sets a baseline from which to improve each product's circularity  according to a development roadmap which covers renewable and alternative materials  refill formats and monomaterial designs for recyclability.Higher production volumes and the integration of Wicklein meant that Quadpack's carbon footprint increased 12%  from 52k to 59k tCO2eq in 2022. However  the GHG (greenhouse gas emissions)-to-turnover ratio reduced by 18%  from 0.5 in 2021  to 0.4 in 2022. Half of all products sold were manufactured in Europe  where the vast majority of Quadpack's clients are based  which contributed to the CO2 ratio improvement. Plans for further GHG reductions cover both Quadpack's own emissions and other emissions in its area of influence  specifically for Scope 3.In terms of social impact  Quadpack Foundation supported a record number of projects  through donations and volunteering hours. With Tim Eaves  as Chief Impact Officer  taking a more active role  the foundation is set to grow significantly.The company's collective social and environmental efforts were recognised with the certification as a Benefit Corporation in a single year. As a B Corp  Quadpack joins a global community of companies with a common goal of using business as a force for good.Serving brands with sustainable innovationsQuadpack's mission is helping beauty brands perform and it does this largely through its packaging solutions. Major launches in 2022 comprised innovations in certified wood and new  sustainable versions of its most popular products. A host of popular sticks  jars and bottles were made available with post-consumer recycled (PCR) content  while new refill solutions were brought to market  such as the Light Me Up airless refillable flowpen.The Woodacity® range of monomaterial wooden solutions expanded with several new formats  including the Iconic Woodacity® lipstick  which was developed in collaboration with Aptar Beauty  a leader in stick mechanisms. The first Woodacity® caps developed for Shiseido's Eaux de Matières by Issey Miyake were awarded the prestigious Formes de Luxe Award for stoppers and closures.2023 outlookThe outlook for 2023 is positive. A new five-year strategy is being devised to respond to the needs and challenges of a changed  post-pandemic world. CEO Alexandra Chauvigné said: “Quadpack is back on track. Over the last months  we have considerably strengthened our position and we are now ready to enter an era of profitable and sustainable growth.

Despite the release of several games being delayed  the Gaming business increased sales by 66.3% to €90.5 million. The Accessories business saw sales fall 36.6% to €61.2 million  affected by the shortage of consoles that caused a sharp contraction in the global accessories market. Overall  NACON’s sales totalled €156.0 million  stable compared with the previous year.Gross margin rose sharply (+18.4%) year-on-year. It amounted to €92.1 million  equal to 59.1% of sales (49.9% in the previous year). The improvement was due to the product mix  with Accessories making up a smaller proportion of sales (39% versus 62% in the previous year).Operating expenses rose because of the large amount of development work underway  but also due to the full-year effect of acquisitions made in 2021/22 and that of Daedalic Entertainment in April 2022.Ebitda after IFRS 2 expense and non-recurring items was €48.9 million  up 25.5% year-on-year (€39.0 million in 2021/22)  and equalled 31.4% of sales (25% in 2021/22).Operating income rose by 29.8% to €17.3 million  equal to 11.1% of sales.Net income was €12.8 million or 8.2% of sales  as opposed to €10.0 million (6.4% of sales) in the previous year.BIGBEN – AUDIOVIDEO/TELCO posted sales of €127.5 million  up 6.4%. Sales of mobile accessories rose by 6.2% to €96.8 million. The Audio/Video business saw sales rise by 6.7% to €30.6 million  due in particular to the integration of Metronic.Supported by a product mix geared towards premium brands  gross margin equalled 27.6% of sales  an improvement of over 10% relative to the previous year.Ebitda after IFRS 2 expense and non-recurring items was €6.5 million  up 75.7% year-on-year.Operating income was €2.5 million higher than in the previous year.Solid financial position reflecting major investments in the Gaming businessAt 31 March 2023  Bigben had equity of €301.0 million and €65.2 million of cash and cash equivalents. Net debt ended the year at €136.6 million  an increase of €82.9 million. The Group had to finance the acquisition of Daedalic Entertainment in April 2022 and took out €46.5 million of new medium-term bank loans to support its strategy.There were positive developments as regards the working capital requirement  which fell by €3.0 million. Operating cash flow for the period was positive at €53.9 million. Investments – mainly the acquisition of Daedalic Entertainment and game development costs – totalled €117.8 million.Strong  profitable growth expected in 2023/24  driven by rapid progress in the Gaming businessFor NACON  2023/24 will feature a heavy release schedule  with around 20 games due to be released during the period as opposed to 13 in the previous year.The start of the current financial year has already brought the release of The Lord of the Rings GollumTM  TT Isle of Man: Ride on the Edge 3 and AFL®  while Cricket24 and Rugby24  the official game of the Rugby World Cup  will come out in July and September respectively.The back catalogue will continue to grow with the addition of games released in 2022/23.The Accessories business should benefit from several factors:a more favourable base for comparison the end of pressures seen in 2022/23  with growth in the installed base of new consoles an offering that will grow in the next few months with the release of several high-potential products.The BIGBEN – AUDIOVIDEO/TELCO segment should continue to benefit from the fact that most new smartphones are now sold without chargers or earphones. At the same time  it is continuing to diversify its sales channels  increasing sales of accessories through the refurbished smartphone channel.Finally  large DIY chains are stocking Metronic’s Audio and Charge products  and this is gradually opening up new commercial opportunities.Since NACON Gaming is likely to see strong growth while Bigben – AudioVideo/Telco should show good resilience  the Group remains confident and is expecting rapid sales growth over the financial year as a whole.DividendsIn its 30 May 2023 meeting  Bigben Interactive’s Board of Directors decided to put the following to the vote in its Annual General Meeting to be held on 21 July 2023:A distribution of one (1) NACON share for every five (5) Bigben Interactive shares held  currently representing approximately 4.25% of NACON’s share capital.Subject to shareholder approval of this distribution in the Annual General Meeting  the ex-date and payment date for the distribution of NACON shares are expected to occur within two weeks of the date of the Annual General Meeting.When it convenes the AGM  Bigben Interactive will issue a detailed press release specifying the technical details of the distribution in kind of NACON shares.GlossaryGross margin: Sales - Purchases used.Ebitda: Operating income before depreciation  amortisation and impairment of property  plant and equipment and intangible assetsNext key events:Annual General Meeting: 21 July 2023First-quarter 2023/24 sales announcement: 24 July 2023 after the market closeABOUT BIGBEN INTERACTIVE2022/23 sales€283.5 millionWORKFORCEOver 1 300 employeesINTERNATIONAL31 subsidiaries and a distribution network in more than 100 countrieswww.bigben-group.comBigben Interactive operates across Europe as a developer and publisher of video games  and as a designer and distributor of smartphone and gaming accessories and audio/video products.

The additional amounts and the extended maturities are also hedged against floating interest rate risks. In total  Banijay has refinanced and raised an amount close to €1 100m. In parallel  Banijay extended the maturity of its €170m RCF by 3 years to September 2027 at EURIBOR + 3.75%4.

The non-IFRS financial measures presented are measures used by management to monitor the underlying performance of the business and operations and  have therefore not been audited or reviewed. Furthermore  they may not be indicative of the historical operating results  nor are they meant to be predictive of future results. These non-IFRS measures are presented because they are considered important supplementary measurements of FL Entertainment N.V.'s (the ""Company"") performance  and we believe that these and similar measures are widely used in the industry in which the Company operates as a way to evaluate a company’s operating performance and liquidity. Not all companies calculate non-IFRS financial measures in the same manner or on a consistent basis. As a result  these measures and ratios may not be comparable to measures used by other companies under the same or similar names.Regulated information related to this press release is available on the website:https://www.flentertainment.com/results-center/https://www.flentertainment.com/APPENDIXGlossaryTransaction: business combination with Pegasus Entrepreneurial Acquisition Company Europe B.V.  a special purpose acquisition company to become a listed company on Euronext Amsterdam as well as the Group’s reorganizationAdjusted EBITDA: for a period is defined as the operating profit for that period excluding restructuring costs and other non-core items  costs associated with the long-term incentive plan within the Group (the ""LTIP"") and employment related earn-out and option expenses  and depreciation and amortization (excluding D&A fiction).

https://congress.eular.org/scientific_programme.cfmNotes to editors:About bimekizumabBimekizumab is a humanized monoclonal IgG1 antibody that is designed to selectively inhibit both interleukin 17A (IL-17A) and interleukin 17F (IL-17F)  two key cytokines driving inflammatory processes.1 2 In August 2021  bimekizumab was first approved in the European Union (EU)/European Economic Area (EEA) and in Great Britain  for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy.2 3 The label information may differ in other countries where approved. Please check local prescribing information.BIMZELX®▼(bimekizumab) EU/EEA Important Safety Information in PsoriasisThe most frequently reported adverse reactions with bimekizumab were upper respiratory tract infections (14.5%) (most frequently nasopharyngitis) and oral candidiasis (7.3%). Common adverse reactions (≥1/100 to <1/10) were oral candidiasis  tinea infections  ear infections  herpes simplex infections  oropharyngeal candidiasis  gastroenteritis  folliculitis  headache  dermatitis and eczema  acne  injection site reactions  fatigue. Elderly may be more likely to experience certain adverse reactions such as oral candidiasis  dermatitis and eczema when using bimekizumab.Bimekizumab is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the excipients and in patients with clinically important active infections (e.g. active tuberculosis).Bimekizumab may increase the risk of infections. Treatment with bimekizumab must not be administered in patients with any clinically important active infection. Patients treated with bimekizumab should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms suggestive of an infection occur. Prior to initiating treatment with bimekizumab  patients should be evaluated for tuberculosis (TB) infection. Bimekizumab should not be given in patients with active TB and patients receiving bimekizumab should be monitored for signs and symptoms of active TB.Cases of new or exacerbations of inflammatory bowel disease have been reported with bimekizumab. Bimekizumab is not recommended in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. If a patient develops signs and symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease or experiences an exacerbation of pre-existing inflammatory bowel disease  bimekizumab should be discontinued and appropriate medical management should be initiated. Serious hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions have been observed with IL-17 inhibitors. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs  administration of bimekizumab should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated.Live vaccines should not be given in patients treated with bimekizumab.Please consult the summary of product characteristics in relation to other side effects  full safety and prescribing information. https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/product-information/bimzelx-epar-product-information_en.pdfEU summary of product characteristics date of revision May 2022.Last accessed: May 2023.▼This medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions.About Cimzia® (certolizumab pegol) in the EU/EEA4In the EU  certolizumab pegol in combination with methotrexate (MTX) is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe active RA in adult patients when the response to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs)  including MTX  has been inadequate. Certolizumab pegol can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to MTX or when continued treatment with MTX is inappropriate. Certolizumab pegol in combination with MTX is also indicated for the treatment of severe  active and progressive RA in adults not previously treated with MTX or other DMARDs. Certolizumab pegol has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of joint damage as measured by X-ray and to improve physical function  when given in combination with MTX.Certolizumab pegol  in combination with MTX  is also indicated for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis in adults when the response to previous DMARD therapy has been inadequate. CIMZIA can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to MTX or when continued treatment with MTX is inappropriate.Certolizumab pegol is also indicated for the treatment of adult patients with severe active axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA)  comprising:Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) - adults with severe active AS who have had an inadequate response to  or are intolerant to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).Axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) without radiographic evidence of AS - adults with severe active axSpA without radiographic evidence of AS but with objective signs of inflammation by elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and/or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) who have had an inadequate response to  or are intolerant to NSAIDs.Certolizumab pegol is also indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy.Cimzia® (certolizumab pegol) EU/EEA Important Safety Information4Cimzia® was studied in 4 049 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in controlled and open label trials for up to 92 months. The commonly reported adverse reactions (1-10%) in clinical trials with certolizumab pegol and post-marketing were viral infections (includes herpes zoster  papillomavirus  influenza)  bacterial infections (including abscess)  rash  headache (including migraine)  asthenia  leukopenia (including lymphopenia  neutropenia)  eosinophilic disorder  pain (any sites)  pyrexia  sensory abnormalities  hypertension  pruritus (any sites)  hepatitis (including hepatic enzyme increase)  injection site reactions  and nausea. Serious adverse reactions include sepsis  opportunistic infections  tuberculosis (including miliary  disseminated and extrapulmonary)  herpes zoster  lymphoma  leukaemia  solid organ tumours  angioneurotic oedema  cardiomyopathies (includes heart failure)  ischemic coronary artery disorders  pancytopenia  hypercoagulation (including thrombophlebitis  pulmonary embolism)  cerebrovascular accident  vasculitis  hepatitis/hepatopathy (includes cirrhosis)  and renal impairment/nephropathy (includes nephritis). In RA controlled clinical trials  4.4% of patients discontinued taking certolizumab pegol due to adverse events vs. 2.7% for placebo.Certolizumab pegol was initially studied in 325 patients with active axial spondyloarthritis (including ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis) in the AS001 clinical study for up to 4 years  which includes a 24-week placebo-controlled phase followed by a 24-week dose-blind period and a 156-week open-label treatment period. Certolizumab pegol was subsequently studied in 317 patients with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis in a placebo-controlled study for 52 weeks (AS0006). Certolizumab pegol was also studied in patients with axial spondyloarthritis (including ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis) in a clinical study for up to 96 weeks  which included a 48-week open-label run-in phase (N=736) followed by a 48-week placebo-controlled phase (N=313) for patients in sustained remission (C-OPTIMISE). Certolizumab pegol was also studied in a 96-week open-label study in 89 axSpA patients with a history of documented anterior uveitis flares. In all 4 studies  the safety profile for these patients was consistent with the safety profile in rheumatoid arthritis and previous experience with certolizumab pegol.Certolizumab pegol was studied in 409 patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in a clinical study for up to 4 years which included a 24-week placebo-controlled phase followed by a 24-week dose-blind period and a 168-week open-label treatment period.The safety profile for axSpA and PsA patients treated with certolizumab pegol was consistent with the safety profile in RA and previous experience with certolizumab pegol.Certolizumab pegol was studied in 1112 patients with psoriasis in controlled and open-label studies for up to 3 years. In the Phase III program  the initial and maintenance periods were followed by a 96-week open-label treatment period. The long-term safety profile of certolizumab pegol 400 mg every 2 weeks and certolizumab pegol 200 mg every 2 weeks was generally similar and consistent with previous experience with certolizumab pegol.Certolizumab pegol is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the excipients  active tuberculosis or other severe infections such as sepsis or opportunistic infections  and moderate to severe heart failure.Serious infections including sepsis  tuberculosis and opportunistic infections (e.g. histoplasmosis  nocardia  candidiasis) have been reported in patients receiving certolizumab pegol. Some of these events have been fatal. Before initiation of therapy with certolizumab pegol  all patients must be evaluated for both active and inactive (latent) tuberculosis infection. If active tuberculosis is diagnosed prior to or during treatment  certolizumab pegol therapy must not be initiated and must be discontinued. If latent tuberculosis is diagnosed  appropriate anti- tuberculosis therapy must be started before initiating treatment with certolizumab pegol.Reactivation of hepatitis B has occurred in patients receiving a TNF-antagonist including certolizumab pegol who are chronic carriers of the virus (i.e. surface antigen positive). Some cases have had a fatal outcome. Patients should be tested for HBV infection before initiating treatment with certolizumab pegol. Carriers of HBV who require treatment with certolizumab pegol should be closely monitored and in the case of HBV reactivation Certolizumab pegol should be stopped and effective anti-viral therapy with appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated.TNF antagonists including certolizumab pegol may increase the risk of new onset or exacerbation of clinical symptoms and/or radiographic evidence of demyelinating disease including multiple sclerosis; of formation of autoantibodies and uncommonly of the development of a lupus-like syndrome; of severe hypersensitivity reactions. If a patient develops any of these adverse reactions  certolizumab pegol should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted.With the current knowledge  a possible risk for the development of lymphomas  leukaemia or other malignancies in patients treated with a TNF antagonist cannot be excluded. Rare cases of neurological disorders  including seizure disorder  neuritis and peripheral neuropathy  have been reported in patients treated with certolizumab pegol.Adverse reactions of the haematologic system  including medically significant cytopenia  have been reported with certolizumab pegol. Advise all patients to seek immediate medical attention if they develop signs and symptoms suggestive of blood dyscrasias or infection (e.g.  persistent fever  bruising  bleeding  pallor) while on certolizumab pegol. Consider discontinuation of certolizumab pegol therapy in patients with confirmed significant haematological abnormalities.The use of certolizumab pegol in combination with anakinra or abatacept is not recommended due to a potential increased risk of serious infections. As no data are available  certolizumab pegol should not be administered concurrently with live vaccines. The 14-day half-life of certolizumab pegol should be taken into consideration if a surgical procedure is planned. A patient who requires surgery while on certolizumab pegol should be closely monitored for infections.Please consult the full prescribing information in relation to other side effects  full safety and prescribing information.European SmPC date of revision June 2022. https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/product-information/cimzia-epar-product-information_en.pdf Last Accessed: March 2023About dapirolizumab pegolDapirolizumab pegol is an investigational humanized polyethylene glycol (PEG)-conjugated antigen-binding (Fab') fragment lacking a functional Fc domain.

By their nature  such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and assumptions which might cause the actual results  financial condition  performance or achievements of UCB  or industry results  to differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Important factors that could result in such differences include: changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  will progress to product approval or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products  which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB's efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover  sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment  including pricing pressure  political and public scrutiny  customer and prescriber patterns or practices  and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes. Finally  a breakdown  cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality  integrity and availability of UCB's data and systems.Given these uncertainties  you should not place undue reliance on any of such forward-looking statements. There can be no guarantee that the investigational or approved products described in this press release will be submitted or approved for sale or for any additional indications or labelling in any market  or at any particular time  nor can there be any guarantee that such products will be or will continue to be commercially successful in the future.UCB is providing this information  including forward-looking statements  only as of the date of this press release.

Beyond this collaboration and the sales momentum observed in Q1 2023  it is important to ensure continued strong financial discipline and secure the Company's financial visibility. This equity line  deliberately limited to a maximum of 11.4% of the capital  can be suspended at any time by the Company depending on its actual needs. In doing so  we are renewing a transaction that we have already carried out successfully in the past with Vester Finance  which reflects the confidence we have in the quality and adaptability of its execution"".Under the terms of the agreement signed on May 31  2023  Vester Finance agreed to subscribe for a maximum of 5 500 000 shares in the Company  representing up to 11.4% of the share capital  at its own initiative  over a maximum period of 24 months  subject to certain customary contractual conditions.The shares will be issued based on the average stock market price preceding each issuance3  less a maximum discount of 6.0%  in compliance with the pricing policy and the cap set by the Annual General Meeting4  as well as a variable fee of up to 2.5%.The Company has agreed to a minimum use of 750 000 euros from the equity line  corresponding to a dilution of around 2.5% at the current share price  beyond which the Company retains the right to suspend or terminate this agreement at any time and at no cost.This transaction was decided by the Company's Board of Directors in accordance with the 25th resolution of the Annual General Meeting of June 2  20225.Assuming full use of this equity line  a shareholder holding 1.00% of Mauna Kea Technologies' capital before the transaction would see a reduction in his stake to 0.90% of the capital on a non-diluted basis6 and 0.76% of the capital on a diluted basis7.The present transaction is not subject to a prospectus submitted for approval to the Autorité des marchés financiers  based on article 1er of the Prospectus Regulation granting an exemption when a transaction involves a dilution of less than 20% of the Company's share capital.The number of shares issued under this transaction and admitted to trading will be announced on the Company's website.This equity line financing was structured and underwritten by Vester Finance  a European company which regularly invests in small-cap growth companies  particularly in the healthcare and biotech sectors. Vester Finance  acting here as an investor with no intention of remaining a shareholder  will sell the shares over time. Such a sale is likely to have an impact on the volatility and liquidity of the stock  as well as on the Company's share price. Over the last 25 similar equity line transactions carried out by Vester Finance  the companies’ share prices have risen by an average of +19% and market capitalizations by +53%8.Risk factorsRisk factors impacting the Company are presented in section 3.2 of the 2022 annual financial report as published by the Company on May 2  2023  available on the Company's website (https://www.maunakeatech.com/uploads/media/media_pdf/0001/04/2022-12%20RFA%20-%202023-04%2028%20DEF.pdf).About Mauna Kea TechnologiesMauna Kea Technologies is a global medical device company that manufactures and markets Cellvizio®  the real-time in vivo cell imaging platform.
