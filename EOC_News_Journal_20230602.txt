25625,Euroclear,Bing API,https://www.irmagazine.com/case-studies/improving-efficiency-dividend-payments,Improving efficiency of dividend payments,The Covid-19 lockdowns highlighted inefficiencies with the payment of dividends through conventional means like checks or bank,Corporates and shareholders have an opportunity to improve efficiency and certainty in how they handle dividend paymentsThe Covid-19 lockdowns highlighted inefficiencies with the payment of dividends through conventional means like checks or bank mandates. These experiences have given renewed impetus to distribute dividends via CREST  the UK’s central security depository  instead. As a result  Euroclear UK & International  the owner and operator of CREST  has launched a campaign aimed at both corporates and intermediaries to encourage the use of CREST for this purpose.There are benefits for both a corporate and its shareholders to jumping on this bandwagon. Before doing so  however  it is key to understand how the CREST distribution mechanism works. There are different approaches a corporate can take and a few approaches introduce significant exposures for that corporate. For instance  some set-ups elevate the corporate’s counterparty risk upon its registrar. In other set-ups  the corporate could even risk funding somebody else’s dividend and consequently not fully paying its own.This article explains all of this from the perspective of Shell  one of the FTSE 100’s largest dividend payers. These perspectives may help fellow FTSE constituents to follow suit. Equally it may serve others that are already distributing their dividends via CREST to recalibrate their set-up after considering the pros and cons of different approaches.Benefits of distributing dividends via the CREST systemIt takes two to tango: a member can receive its dividend via CREST only if both the corporate and the member have opted in. Across the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250  roughly half of corporates  representing around 75 percent of total FTSE dividend value  already employ CREST for their dividend distributions. Currently  around 95 percent (by value) of the FTSE’s equity is held by intermediaries that are already set up to automatically receive their dividends via CREST. But around 60 percent of all members and about 40 percent of accounts in CREST (both by number) cannot yet be paid via this route.While distribution of dividends via CREST can make profound sense for both the corporate and its investors  there are still various aspects to carefully consider. As with any other payment channel  it all centers on parceling out a dividend robustly and swiftly in a cost-efficient manner while minimizing risks.1. Pounds sterling  euros and dollars backed by central bank money: CREST provides a central bank-backed cash distribution capability across pounds sterling  euros and dollars. This currency range meets the needs of most FTSE corporates and in any case covers the lion’s share of their dividends. While Euroclear UK & International may consider adding other currencies to its capability  in the interim a corporate can continue distributing its dividend in other currencies through its existing means (for example  bank transfers).2. Ability to always pay holders in CREST their whole dividend: A key benefit compared with checks and bank mandates is that via CREST a shareholder arranges its ability to be paid upfront. Therefore  a shareholder can always be paid a dividend by any corporate in which it may hold shares at a certain moment in time in any of its CREST member accounts. This eradicates the endless – typically still paper-based – updates of bank mandates and all associated risks and nuisances for both the corporate and its shareholders. Equally  it removes the mutually cumbersome and time-consuming follow-ups on missed payments.3. Fully integrated electronic messaging operated by registrar: Dividend distributions via CREST automatically provide a dividend confirmation  representing a valid tax voucher  to each holder in electronic form. This removes the need for the corporate to send any additional (paper) dividend notifications to its dematerialized holders. Regardless of the specific set-up chosen  in practice  a corporate’s share registrar will operate the distributions via CREST. All three main UK share registrars have such a capability and are actively distributing dividends via CREST for various of their corporate issuer clients.4. Swift and instant electronic settlement  removing the need for any prefunding: Payments through CREST help to remove the need for a corporate to prefund its registrar  while its holders can still be confident of receiving their dividends first thing in the morning. This avoids any yield losses and credit risks for the corporate. In turn  holders in CREST can immediately apply the funds received to settle subsequent transactions  improving settlement and cash efficiency. Distributions via CREST tend to start at 6.00 am UK time in all three currencies and dividend distributions are usually completed within 30 minutes. This is quicker  earlier and more predictable than one would be able to achieve via bank transfers.Distributions via CREST represent a form of electronic cash distribution. While it is worthwhile to validate one’s articles of association  typically the articles allow a corporate to employ any form of electronic cash distribution for its dividends and thus accommodate distributions via CREST.5. Reasonable cost for the dividend paying corporate: Euroclear UK & International currently charges around 6.56p (about 7 cents) per CREST member account paid (covering making the payment  sending the input message and receiving the response message). FTSE corporates face a similar direct holder base in CREST. Shell has around 550 CREST members holding their shares in around 3 500 CREST member accounts. This results in a total charge for Shell of around £230 ($284) for each of its quarterly dividends (including all dividend confirmations/tax vouchers).The aspects discussed so far hardly depend upon the specific implementation set-up chosen. But this is not the case when it comes to the exposure of intermediaries during transfers. Here  different set-ups come with radically different risks. To appreciate this  one must first understand how cash distributions via CREST work.Basic understanding of CREST’s payment mechanismDistributing dividends via CREST involves a receiving agent and a CREST settlement bank. A receiving agent is a specific type of CREST participant that any legal person can request Euroclear UK & International to set up in its own name. The legal person acting as receiving agent is the debit party in the same way as the holder of a bank account is  used alternatively for dividend distributions.A CREST settlement bank is a commercial bank the receiving agent selects as the party supplying the liquidity in the relevant currency and thus enabling the payments. Most banks providing cash management services to UK corporates also act as CREST settlement banks. It is possible to select different banks for one or more of the currencies.For each currency  the receiving agent sets up a cash memorandum account (CMA) with a CREST settlement bank. It is this CMA that is used to record any payment in a certain currency made by the receiving agent. The CREST system credits and debits  instantaneously and irrevocably  the CMAs of the CREST member and the receiving agent  respectively. This makes a CMA like a bank account that otherwise would have been used to distribute dividends.To control the maximum amount an individual receiving agent can distribute  its CREST settlement bank will impose a CMA cap. This represents the maximum cumulative net debit position the receiving agent can run on a dividend payment day. The CREST settlement bank tends to raise the CMA cap before 6.00 am UK time when CREST opens for payments. As soon as dividends start to settle  this CMA cap will automatically be lowered accordingly. Once all dividends in a certain currency have settled  the CMA cap will be back to zero.It is key to note that this CMA cap cannot distinguish dividend payments made on the same day for different corporates. Therefore  if a receiving agent queues up dividend payments for multiple corporate clients that are all due for the same payment day  raising the CMA cap will automatically cause dividend payments of all these corporates to start settling.If corporates opt to employ the same receiving agent  they create an interdependency between themselves and an elevated exposure for the registrar operating the receiving agent. As such  a company runs the risk of accidentally funding another company’s dividend and therefore not fully paying out its own. Alternatively  its own dividend distribution may be held up  while awaiting all other companies to provide their funding.Three different implementation set-ups applied in practiceAs mentioned  about half of the companies across the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 already distribute dividends via CREST. Among this group  three different implementation set-ups are applied in practice  which differ in the choice made for the parties that serve as receiving agent and CREST settlement bank.1. Registrar’s omnibus receiving agent and registrar’s generic CREST settlement bank: In this set-up  the corporate allows its registrar to use the same receiving agent its registrar employs for various other corporate clients to distribute dividends and potentially distributions related to other types of corporate events. In this set-up  the registrar is the receiving agent and therefore also selects the CREST settlement bank it uses for these distributions. One could compare this set-up with corporates collectively using the same bank account from which to distribute their dividend. The registrar  as account holder  selects the associated bank.2. Registrar’s personal receiving agent and registrar’s specific CREST settlement bank: Like the previous set-up  the corporate allows its registrar to employ one of the registrar’s receiving agents  but in this variant the corporate and its registrar agree that this receiving agent can be used only to distribute dividend payments of this corporate. As a consequence  this variant also allows the corporate to specify which CREST settlement bank(s) this receiving agent must employ. This set-up compares with each corporate distributing its dividend from a personal bank account held by the registrar. The personal nature allows the corporate to specify at which bank the registrar must hold this account.3. Issuer’s receiving agent and its own CREST settlement bank: Finally  in the third variant  the corporate sets up a receiving agent in its own name and as a consequence also contracts its CREST settlement bank(s) itself. It must be stressed that also in this set-up the registrar continues to operate the dividend distributions via CREST. Here  the set-up compares with dividend distributions being made from a bank account held by the corporate  but still operated by the registrar. It is the corporate that contracts the bank.(Re)considering the set-up to pay dividends via CRESTEach set-up comes with its own characteristics. The following aspects are relevant for any corporate that considers paying its dividend via CREST or is already doing so.Convenience to implement: Employing the registrar’s omnibus receiving agent and its generic CREST settlement bank tends to be the easiest to employ. In practice  it merely requires the corporate to consent to its registrar employing such a practice. Requiring a specific receiving agent and employing a specific CREST settlement bank may require some more engagement with one’s registrar and will be more onerous upfront. Doing so will require filing some paperwork with Euroclear UK & International and opening the CMAs at the CREST settlement bank the corporate prefers.Once any of these three set-ups have been put in place  the corporate’s registrar can operate them in an identical fashion  representing no real difference for the corporate. Furthermore  Euroclear UK & International currently charges each receiving agent a small amount (currently £20 per month)  making the associated cost arguably not the most relevant factor of consideration. Furthermore  in all three set-ups  the registrar can connect the receiving agent to CREST via the registrar’s user (being the party providing the gateway connection).Execution risk on the dividend payment day: As explained above  employing an omnibus receiving agent creates an interdependency between corporate issuers and an elevated exposure for the registrar operating this receiving agent. With more corporates paying their dividends via CREST  this exposure will increase. Being served through a personal receiving agent or setting up a receiving agent in one’s own name removes this downside risk for a corporate.Alternatively  a corporate could consider accepting this downside risk if: a) it trusts its registrar to always manage this inherent exposure effectively; b) it believes it is sufficiently covered under the terms and conditions it has agreed with its registrar; and c) it finds its registrar sufficiently liquid to compensate swiftly and fully for any damages suffered. In addition  the corporate should consider its tolerance of its dividend distribution being held up by other corporates. The corporate may also want to reflect what it anticipates gaining from accepting these downside risks.Counterparty risk for registrar: Employing a receiving agent held by the registrar  omnibus or personal  will inevitably place upon the corporate a counterparty risk versus its registrar. For this very reason  various corporates have traditionally opted to set up bank accounts in their own name  segregated from their group cash pool  that their registrar could still operate on behalf of the corporate to distribute its dividends.Extending such an approach toward distributions via CREST can be achieved only by setting up a receiving agent in the corporate’s own name. This is the only way via which the corporate can hold the CMAs at a CREST settlement bank in the corporate’s own name. It should also be noted that an alternative acknowledgement of trust cannot be arranged effectively around the CMAs of an omnibus receiving agent.Employing corporate’s own principal cash management bank(s): Contracting the CREST settlement bank(s) in the name of the corporate allows selecting the principal cash management bank(s) for this purpose. As explained in an earlier article  doing so represents three main benefits:First  it allows the corporate to employ the very same payment technologies  proven global product capability  execution track-record and balance sheet strength that underpinned the corporate’s choice for its principal cash management bank(s)Second  it allows for contracting these services under existing framework agreements  capturing economies of scope and scale for the corporate’s benefitThird  extending the involvement of a corporate’s principal cash management bank up to its shareholders’ doorstep makes all associated transfers intra-bank and intra-issuer. This allows for overnight processing and thus facilitates earlier settlement on payment day  while avoiding any credit concerns for both the bank and the corporate.Finding the optimal set-upIt is an individual corporate’s full and exclusive prerogative to select and refine the set-up that suits best. Obviously  both the size and the frequency of a corporate’s dividend is highly relevant. Therefore  it will not be a surprise to hear that Shell  currently paying a dividend worth around $2 bn per quarter in pounds sterling  euros and dollars  has opted for setting up a receiving agent in its own name  operated by its share registrar Equiniti  and employing its principal cash management bank Citi as its CREST settlement bank. In (re)considering the optimal set-up  it is advisable that the IR and treasury departments and company secretariat team up and jointly discuss options with both their principal cash management bank(s) and their registrar.In addition  Euroclear UK & International has launched a helpful web page with ample reference materials  including the CREST reference manual and tariff brochure  which can be found here (click on ‘access as a guest’). Finally  it never hurts to consult one or more peers working for similar corporates to hear their perspectives and experiences.About the authorsAnthony Clarke  Shell’s deputy company secretary and Paul Vos  Shell’s senior manager of treasury and corporate finance are available to provide further details.

In addition to patent protection  masitinib is also eligible for regulatory data protection in Canada  preventing generic competition for a period of 8 years following initial approval.As a reminder  Health Canada had granted authorization to file a new drug submission for masitinib in the treatment of ALS under the notice of compliance with conditions (NOC/c) policy. Market authorization under the NOC/c policy allows Health Canada to provide earlier market access to potentially life-saving drugs. NOC/c status is given to eligible drugs that have demonstrated promising clinical effectiveness in clinical trials. On May 9  2023  AB Science announced that Health Canada had resumed its review of the application of masitinib in the treatment of ALS. Under the NOC/c policy  Health Canada has a target of 200 calendar days maximum to review the application.Masitinib has also received orphan drug designation for ALS from both the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This orphan drug designation provides 10 and 7 years of market exclusivity in Europe and the United States respectively  subsequent to product approval.An estimated 3 000 Canadians are currently living with ALS. Each year approximately 1 000 Canadians die from ALS. A similar number of Canadians are diagnosed with ALS each year.About amyotrophic lateral sclerosisAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal motor neuron disorder that is characterized by progressive loss of the upper and lower motor neurons at the spinal or bulbar level. The disease belongs to a group of disorders known as motor neuron diseases  which are characterized by the gradual degeneration and death of motor neurons. In ALS  both the upper motor neurons and the lower motor neurons degenerate or die  and stop sending messages to muscles.The prevalence of ALS in western countries is fairly uniform at 6 per 100 000 persons  corresponding to around 30 000 cases in Europe and 20 000 in the USA.About AB ScienceFounded in 2001  AB Science is a pharmaceutical company specializing in the research  development and commercialization of protein kinase inhibitors (PKIs)  a class of targeted proteins whose action are key in signaling pathways within cells. Our programs target only diseases with high unmet medical needs  often lethal with short term survival or rare or refractory to previous line of treatment.AB Science has developed a proprietary portfolio of molecules and the Company’s lead compound  masitinib  has already been registered for veterinary medicine and is developed in human medicine in oncology  neurological diseases  inflammatory diseases and viral diseases.

The data collected has enabled us to improve the performance of our device and the associated application  so that we can carry out increasingly precise tests and bring us closer to a future market launch.

The Company de-listed from the AIM market as of 26 April 2023.STRATEGYSince the Strategic Review  and throughout 2022  we pursued a strategy of broadening our R&D pipeline by initiating internal programmes  collaborating with third party pharmaceutical companies on their proprietary active pharmaceutical ingredients  or APIs  and adding new indications to MTX110. New internal programmes were selected and prioritised based on the expected time to deliver proof-of-concept data for potential partnering.Other than adding a second R&D collaboration with Janssen Pharmaceutica NV  for reasons not always within our control  we were not successful in finding partners for our internal Q-Sphera pipeline. As our cash runway ran down  and the market for biotech financing worsened in 2022  we considered the opportunities for refinancing the Company as a drug delivery company were limited. Accordingly  we concluded that repositioning the Company as a therapeutics company  focused on rare and orphan products in a merger with Bioasis Technologies  Inc. (Bioasis) with an attendant $10.0 million financing was the optimal solution for the Company. Although the merger and financing did not proceed  we were successful in raising $6.0 million  repositioning the Company as a clinical-stage therapeutics company supported by enabling technologies. In line with that repositioning  we undertook a restructuring in March 2023 including a cost reduction programme and termination of our internal Q-Sphera programmes. These initiatives are described more fully in the Chief Executive's Review.Following the repositioning of the Company  our priorities for 2023 reflect our modified strategy as follows:Strategic ImperativesProgress in 2022Priorities for 2023Advance our clinical -stage assets through to proof-of-concept dataWe announced the recruitment of our first patient in the first cohort of a Phase I study of MTX110 in recurrent GBM (rGBM) in two clinical centres in the US.In respect of our Phase I study in rGBM  deliver interim safety and efficacy data (in the form of Progression Free Survival data) in respect of Cohort A patients and recruit Cohort B patients.Finalise recruitment of our second Phase I study in DIPG and report safety data.Accelerate recruitment of our Phase I study in medulloblastoma.Develop and broaden applications for our three primary drug delivery technologiesHaving discovered we could encapsulate and retain the functional integrity of a monoclonal antibody  we explored additional potential applications for our Q-Sphera technology including antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) and BiTes.We completed our assignment under our first R&D collaboration with Janssen  including optimising drug loading of Janssen's proprietary large molecule using our Q-Sphera technology.Generate in vivo data to demonstrate intratumoral delivery of drugs using our proprietary technology.Explore opportunities for MTX110 in combination therapy for brain and metastatic CNS cancer.Expand further our patent portfolio to cover new inventions and divisionals to strengthen existing patent families.Enter into R&D collaborations at the feasibility stage and/or licenses at proof-of-concept stage with third partiesIn January 2022 and again in March 2022  we announced two R&D collaborations with Janssen. We have been tasked with maximising drug loading and optimising in vitro duration of release for two of Janssen's experimental large molecules using our Q-Sphera technology.Enter into R&D collaborations with third parties to formulate their proprietary molecules using our technology platforms.Seek a partner to develop  or co-develop  MTX110 once preliminary data from our Phase I study in recurrent GBM become available.Seek opportunities to diversify our pre-clinical and clinical-stage pipelineWe explored additional indications for MTX110 during the year although the decision to reposition the Company as a therapeutics (as opposed to drug delivery) company was actioned in early 2023.We added a new research programme coded MTD217 focused on developing new therapeutics options for metastatic cancers including leptomeningeal disease.Identify and acquire at least one development asset to in-license  ideally in oncology and for a rare/orphan indication.Initiate additional preclinical studies to assess the potential for MTD217 inhibitors in leptomeningeal disease.Strategic ReportGovernanceFinancial Statements01Biodexa Pharmaceuticals PLC?Annual Report and Accounts 2022Strategic ImperativesProgress in 2022Priorities for 2023Provide a healthy and stimulating environment in which our staff members can continue to thrive and innovateWe have been compliant with ISO 9001 since 2014.During the year  we introduced a new COSHH assessment procedure to better quantify the safety of chemicals and third parties' APIs being deployed in our laboratories.Continue to monitor third party advice and regulation to maintain a safe environment for our staff members.Develop individualised learning programmes for staff members through participation in conferences  webinars and/or training programmes.BUSINESS MODELFollowing our Strategic Review in March 2020  we reverted to a traditional biotech business model. We aimed to deploy our proprietary technologies to develop proof-of-concept formulations and then enter into licensing agreements with third party pharmaceutical companies.In order to make the Company more investable and secure additional financing  the Board decided to reposition the Company as a therapeutics (as opposed to drug delivery) company in early 2023. As a result  the delivery of proof-of-concept clinical data is the primary focus of our business model going forward. DevelopmentOur intention is to build a balanced portfolio of clinical-stage development assets  ideally focused on oncology and on rare/orphan indications. Our only current clinical-stage asset  MTX110 is in Phase I development for three rare/orphan brain cancers.Our R&D programmes may  like MTX110  be based on one or more of our enabling technologies.Our aim is to enter into R&D collaborations with third parties to develop proof-of-concept formulations of their proprietary compounds using our proprietary drug delivery technologies. We will not be expanding our internal pipeline of drug delivery based programmes.ManufacturingTo establish proof-of-concept in pre-clinical studies for potential licensees  we are able to manufacture non-GMP Q-Sphera products at pilot scale at our Cardiff facility. Upon securing a license partner who wishes to start clinical studies  our intention would be to technology transfer GMP manufacture of clinical trial supplies and ultimately full GMP commercial manufacture to a third party CMO. We would expect a licensee to assume the cost of manufacturing GMP product and commercial scale-up pursuant to a technology transfer agreement. MTX110 is currently being manufactured to GMP standards at a CMO.CommercialisationOnce proof-of-concept has been established  we intend to seek to license our products to a partner who would complete the clinical development and subsequently market and sell them in the licensed territory. In addition to reimbursement of development costs  the partner would be expected to make milestone payments based on sales targets and royalty payments.

Panobinostat is currently marketed under the brand Farydak® which is used orally in combination therapy for the treatment of multiple myeloma. We are currently researching the utility of MTX110 to proof-of-concept stage in three indications:INTRODUCTION continued02Biodexa Pharmaceuticals PLC?Annual Report and Accounts 2022Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM):GBM is the most common and aggressive form of brain cancer in adults  usually occurring in the white matter of the cerebrum. Treatments include radiation  surgical resection and chemotherapy  although in almost all cases tumours recur. There are approximately 2?3/100 000(1) population diagnoses of GBM per annum. Survival with standard of care treatment ranges from approximately 13 months in unmethylated MGMT patients to approximately 30 months in highly methylated MGMT patients(2).Following IND approval in December 2021  we are in the process of recruiting patients in a Phase I study to assess the utility of MTX110 in recurrent GBM. The Phase I study is an open-label  dose escalation study designed to assess the feasibility and safety of intermittent infusions of MTX110 administered by convection enhanced delivery (CED) via implanted refillable pump and catheter. The study aims to recruit two cohorts  each with a minimum of four patients; the first cohort will receive MTX110 only and the second cohort will receive MTX110 in combination with lomustine.Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG):DIPG tumours are located in the pons (middle) of the brain stem and are diffusely infiltrating. Occurring mostly in children  approximately 1 000 patients(3) worldwide are diagnosed with DIPG per annum and median survival is approximately 10 months(4). There is no effective treatment since surgical resection is not possible. The standard of care is radiotherapy  which transiently improves symptoms and survival. Chemotherapy does not improve survival and one likely reason is that many anti-cancer drugs cannot cross the blood?brain barrier to access the tumour.In October 2020  we reported the first-in-human study by the University of California  San Francisco (""UCSF"") of MTX110 in DIPG using a convection enhanced delivery (""CED"") system. The Phase I study established a recommended dose range for Phase II  a good safety and tolerability profile but also encouraging survival data in the seven patients treated. Medulloblastoma:Medulloblastomas are malignant embryonal tumours that start in the cerebellum. They are invasive and  unlike most brain tumours  spread through the cerebrospinal fluid (""CSF"") and frequently metastasise to different locations in the brain and spinal cord. Treatments include resection  radiation and chemotherapy. Approximately 350 patients(5) are diagnosed with medulloblastoma per annum and 3 800 people are living with the disease in the US. The cumulative survival rate is approximately 60%  52%  and 47% at 5 years  10 years  and 20 years  respectively(6); however  recurrence is nearly always fatal with no established standard of care.The University of Texas is undertaking a Phase I exploratory study in recurrent medulloblastoma patients using direct administration of MTX110 into the fourth ventricle  enabling it to circulate throughout the CSF.(1) American Association of Neurosurgeons(2) Radke et al (2019).

Cancer. 118 (5): 1313?22TECHNOLOGIESQ-SpheraOur Q-Sphera technology employs 3-D printing techniques to encapsulate medicines in polymer-based bioresorbable microspheres. The microspheres may be injected to form depots in the body which release drug over predictable  sustained periods from one week up to several months. The features and benefits of Q-Sphera technology offer numerous potential advantages to patients and payors compared with immediate release products and other polymer-based technologies.MidaSolveOur MidaSolve technology increases the aqueous solubility of certain classes of anti-cancer drugs using complexes that solubilise these agents in water  thereby enabling them to be injected in liquid form directly into tumours.The MidaSolve complexation agents (cyclodextrins) comprise a hydrophobic inner surface and a hydrophilic outer surface  and as a result are capable of forming host?guest complexes with normally water-insoluble molecules. The hydrophobic  poorly water-soluble drug associates with the inner  more hydrophobic surface of the MidaSolve host  while the hydrophilic outer surface allows the complex to dissolve at biological pH.MidaCoreOur MidaCore technology platform is based on ultra-small gold nanoparticle (GNP) drug conjugates  which at 2?4nm are among the smallest particles in biomedical use. They are composed of a core of gold salts decorated with an array of therapeutic and/or targeting ligands. The small size and multi-functional arrangement around the gold core underpin the ability to improve biodistribution and target tumour and/or immune sites.MidaCore design and synthesis GNP technology enables the production of nano-medications  which we believe are five-to-tenfold smaller than any other delivery vehicle in medical use.Strategic ReportGovernanceFinancial Statements03Biodexa Pharmaceuticals PLC?Annual Report and Accounts 2022IntroductionWith probably the most challenging market backdrop since the financial crisis in 2008/10 for financing biotech companies  2022 was dominated by efforts to refinance the Company before its cash runway was due to expire in the first quarter of 2023. These efforts included our proposed acquisition of Bioasis and financing which was voted down by a group of shareholders followed by a successful  smaller financing and shift in strategic focus in early 2023.Commercial updateWe made some incremental steps with our commercial strategy in 2022. In January we announced that Janssen had extended our R&D collaboration to optimise the drug loading and in vitro dissolution of a proprietary Janssen protein using our Q-Sphera technology. In March we announced that Janssen had further extended the collaboration to include the optimisation of drug loading and in vitro dissolution of a second protein. We have met our objectives with the first assignment and continue to work on the second.R&D updateMTX110Employing our MidaSolve technology  MTX110 solubilises panobinostat  a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor currently used in the treatment of multiple myeloma. In a liquid formulation as MTX110  panobinostat can be delivered directly to a patient's tumour under constant pressure via a catheter system (Convection Enhanced Delivery  or ""CED"")  thereby bypassing the blood?brain barrier and allowing for high drug concentrations and broader drug distribution in and around the tumour while simultaneously minimising systemic toxicity and other side effects.During 2021  following receipt of promising pre-clinical data from tumour models and in vitro patient-derived cell lines  we reprioritised our development of MTX110 in favour of GBM  potentially a very significant opportunity with annual diagnoses of 2?3/100 000 population and global market potential of US$3?5 billion. In December 2021 we received an IND to proceed with an open label  dose escalation study designed to assess the feasibility and safety of intermittent infusions of MTX110 administered by CED via implanted refillable pump and catheter. The study aims to recruit two cohorts  each with a minimum of four patients; the first cohort will receive MTX110 only and the second cohort will receive MTX110 in combination with lomustine. We announced our first patient enrolled in the trial in November 2022 and the Data Safety Monitoring Board recommended the dose be escalated to 90µM  the expected optimal dose for patients. We are aiming for preliminary safety and efficacy data (in the form of Progression Free Survival data) for the first cohort in the third quarter of 2023.We initially began developing MTX110 for DIPG  the ultra-rare  highly aggressive and inoperable form of childhood brain cancer. We have an ongoing Phase I study in the US with one more patient required for completion. We are also evaluating the utility of MTX110 in medulloblastoma in a pilot study at the University of Texas.Q-SpheraDevelopment programmes in our internal Q-Sphera pipeline are designed to address large markets but also offer significant clinical benefits compared with current therapies and  importantly for reimbursement  savings to the healthcare system. MTD211 (Q-brexpiprazole)We have developed a long-acting formulation of brexpiprazole. In in vivo studies  MTD211 demonstrated that a single dose is expected to deliver therapeutic blood levels of brexpiprazole over a period of approximately three months. Marketed under the brand name Rexulti®  brexpiprazole is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia and adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD)  and is currently only available as an immediate release oral tablet. The market for anti-psychotic drugs has shifted towards long-acting formulations for reasons of improved patient compliance and lowering of payor costs associated with patient hospitalisation events. MTD211 is available for licensing.MTX223 Q-Protein  partnered with JanssenWe are continuing to collaborate with Janssen on a second large molecule to optimise drug loading and in vitro dissolution profiles.MidaSolveMTD217 (MTX110 plus an oxphosphorylation inhibitor)Our recently initiated MTD217 programme explores simultaneous inhibition of aerobic glycolysis and oxphosphorylation  key metabolic pathways for cancer cells. Our programme is centred around a number of new water-soluble drug formulations that can be easily infused or injected simultaneously  or sequentially  directly into the cancer microenvironment  disrupting metabolic functions in a highly localised manner and limiting off-target toxicity. We have already demonstrated up to a six-fold synergistic effect of administering MTX110  with an oxphosphorylation inhibitor in vitro in three patient-derived cell lines. On the back of those data  we have established new patent positions to protect these combination formulations.Our initial target is treatment of leptomeningeal disease  a lethal complication in which metastatic cancer cells invade the cerebrospinal fluid and central nervous system. In collaboration with several large academic centres  we are now accelerating preclinical studies to generate proof of concept data that can support a future clinical trial application.MidaCoreWe are using our GNP technology to engineer a formulation of methotrexate for the topical treatment of psoriasis. Pre-clinical data have shown that MTX114 normalises skin thickness in mouse psoriatic skin models. There are estimated to be over 100 million(2) people who suffer from psoriasis worldwide. MTX114 is available for licensing.(1) Jansen et al  2015. Neuro-Oncology 17(1):160-166(2) Psoriasis.orgCHIEF EXECUTIVE'S REVIEW04Biodexa Pharmaceuticals PLC?Annual Report and Accounts 2022Strategic repositioning in 2023Since our £9.0 million (net) fundraise in July 2021 we had consistently forecast that our cash resources would fund operations into the first quarter of 2023. As our cash runway ran down  and the market for biotech financing worsened in 2022  we found the opportunities for refinancing as a drug delivery company were  for practical purposes  non-existent.BioasisIn response to the lack of appetite to refinance a drug delivery platform company  the Board looked for opportunities to merge or acquire other companies to create a more investable therapeutics company. Accordingly  the Board proposed an acquisition of Bioasis  a multi-asset company listed on the TSX-V exchange with two platform technologies that had been validated by partnerships and licenses with pharmaceutical companies with potential milestone payments totalling in excess of US$200 million. The enlarged  merged company would have been repositioned as a therapeutics company with an internal pipeline focused on rare and orphan products. Importantly  we had secured a $10.0 million financing conditional upon the acquisition. One shareholder corralled sufficient votes to ensure the requisite Special Resolutions to approve the acquisition and financing were not approved and  accordingly  the acquisition and financing did not proceed.FinancingAfter the General Meeting on 23 January 2023 at which the Bioasis acquisition and financing were voted down  we had only a short time to secure funding  failing which the Directors would have no option other than to place the Group in Administration. At this time  the Company engaged Quantuma Advisory Limited  a specialist business advisory firm  to advise the Board on its obligations to creditors  in particular. Ultimately  we were successful in raising $6.0 million using a cashbox structure which did not require shareholder approval but on terms materially more dilutive than those of the conditional financing originally proposal alongside the Bioasis acquisition. At the time  in early February  the Board had considered it had no actionable alternatives to Administration other than the $6.0 million financing. The financing is expected to allow the Group to fund operations into the fourth quarter of 2023 and progress its clinical-stage asset MTX110  in particular.Repositioning the Company as a therapeutics companyIn the course of raising additional finance for the Company in late 2022 and early 2023  it became clear that a therapeutics company was more investable than a drug delivery platform company. Accordingly  the Board determined that the Company should be repositioned as a therapeutics company supported by three enabling technologies. Going forward  our priority will be moving our development programmes into the clinic and generating clinical data to demonstrate proof-of-concept. We intend to continue our existing  and seek new  R&D collaborations for our drug delivery technologies but we will not be expanding our internal drug delivery platform.De-listing from AIMThe Board decided to cancel the Company's AIM listing for a number of reasons including: an increasingly smaller proportion of trading in the Ordinary Shares is conducted on AIM compared to NASDAQ; improved liquidity through concentration of trading in the Company's securities on a single market; and the cost  management time commitment and the burden of complying with the AIM Rules and maintaining a quotation on AIM is duplicative of that for complying with the NASDAQ rules. In addition  the Company intends to seek opportunities to expand its pipeline through the acquisition and/or in-licensing of additional development programmes. Given the Company's market capitalisation  transactions are likely to be deemed reverse takeovers under AIM rules  requiring suspension and relisting via a new Admission Document which is both time-consuming and costly.Change of nameOur intention is that repositioning as a therapeutics company should represent a ?fresh start' for the Company. To reflect this change the Company's name was changed to Biodexa Pharmaceuticals PLC following a General Meeting on 24 March 2023.Restructuring in 2023In March 2023  in order to better align our resources with our repositioning as a therapeutics company  we undertook a cost-reduction programme which included making redundant seven staff members at a one-time cost of £88 000.OutlookThe financing environment for biotech companies in general  and small and micro-cap companies in particular  is extremely challenging. While we have secured financing into the fourth quarter of 2023  the Company remains open to opportunities to acquire assets and/or merge with other companies to both broaden the R&D portfolio and make Biodexa more investable.Strategic ReportGovernanceFinancial Statements05Biodexa Pharmaceuticals PLC?Annual Report and Accounts 2022IntroductionBiodexa Pharmaceuticals PLC (the ""Company"") was incorporated as a company on 12 September 2014 and is domiciled in England and Wales.Financial analysisKey performance indicators20222021ChangeTotal gross revenue(1)£0.70m£0.58m21%R&D expenditure£5.11m£4.65m10%R&D as % of operating costs53%61%n/aNet cash (outflow)/inflow for the year(£7.22m)£2.52mn/m(1) Total gross revenue represents collaboration income.RevenueIn the year ended 31 December 2022  Biodexa generated consolidated total gross revenue of £0.70m (2021: £0.58m)  an increase of 21% on the prior year. This arose from customer revenue as in 2021. Customer revenue was derived entirely from the Group's R&D collaboration agreements with Janssen in both years. The R&D collaboration agreement with Janssen has been expanded to include two proteins in 2022.Research and development expenditureResearch and development costs increased by £0.46m  or 10% to £5.11m (2021: £4.65m) in the year primarily due to £0.6m increased staff costs as the Group invested in in-house capabilities and £0.4m increase in clinical costs on MTX110. These increases are offset by reductions of £0.2m in pre-clinical costs and £0.2m in patent related costs as the Group rationalised its portfolio.Administrative costsAdministrative costs in the year increased by £1.60m  or 54% to £4.54m (2021: £2.95m). The increase is predominately due to £1.36m fees relating to the proposed acquisition of Bioasis and a provision of £0.4m against a payment made and future loan commitments to Bioasis under the Promissory Note agreed as part of the proposed transaction. There were also compensating immaterial changes in the cost of insurance and staff costs in the year.Impairment of intangible assetsThere was no impairment charge against intangible assets in 2022 and 2021.Staff costsDuring the year  the average number of staff increased to 27 (2021: 20)  reflecting the investment in the in-house research and development team. Total staff cost increased 51% to £2.52m (2021: £1.67m).Capital expenditureThe total cash expenditure on property plant and equipment in 2022 was £0.06m (2021: £0.32m)  largely in respect of investment in laboratory equipment and IT equipment as headcount increased.Cash flowNet cash outflow from operating activities in 2022 was £7.05m (2021: outflow £6.01m) driven by a net loss of £7.66m (2021: loss £5.46m) and after positive movements in working capital of £0.521m (2021: negative £0.62m)  taxes received of £0.68m (2021: £1.16m)  and other net negative adjustments for non-cash items totalling £0.59m (2021: negative £1.09m).Investing activities outflow in 2022 of £0.22m (2021: outflow of £0.28m) included purchases of property  plant and equipment of £0.06m (2021: £0.32m) and a loan to Bioasis relating to the proposed acquisition announced in December 2022 of £0.2m offset by proceeds from the disposal of assets of £0.02m (2021: £0.04m) and interest income from bank deposits of £0.03m (2021: £nil).Financing activities inflow in 2022 of £0.05m (2021: inflow of £8.81m) was driven by receipts from share issues  including exercise of warrants  of £0.24m (2021: £9.04m). The other principal outflows related to the repayment of Spanish government loans of £nil (2021: £0.10m)  interest paid of £0.02m (2021: £0.02m) and payments on lease liabilities of £0.18m (2021: £0.11m).As a result of the foregoing  net cash outflow for the year was £7.22m (2021: inflow of £2.52m).Share consolidation and ADS ratioAt a General Meeting on 24 March 2023  shareholders approved a consolidation of the Company's Ordinary Shares on a one for 20 basis. As a result the par value of the Ordinary Shares was changed from £0.001 per share to £0.02 per share. At the same time  the ratio of the Company's Ordinary Shares to ADSs was changed from each ADS representing 25 Ordinary Shares to each ADS representing five Ordinary Shares.FINANCIAL REVIEW06Biodexa Pharmaceuticals PLC?Annual Report and Accounts 2022Going concernThe Group and Company has experienced net losses and significant cash outflows from cash used in operating activities over the past years as it develops its portfolio. For the year ended 31 December 2022  the Group incurred a consolidated loss from operating activities of £7.66m and negative cash flows from operations of £7.05m. As of 31 December  2022  the Group had an accumulated deficit of £135.3m.The Group's future viability is dependent on its ability to raise cash from financing activities to finance its development plans until commercialisation  generate cash from operating activities and to successfully obtain regulatory approval to allow marketing of its development products. The Group's failure to raise capital as and when needed could have a negative impact on its financial condition and ability to pursue its business strategies.The Group's consolidated financial statements have been presented on a going concern basis  which contemplates the realisation of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.As at 31 December 2022  the Group had cash and cash equivalents of £2.84m. The Directors forecast that the Group currently has enough cash to fund its planned operations into the fourth quarter of 2023. On 9 February 2023 the Company completed a Private Placement in which it raised US$5.2 million (approximately £4.3 million)  after deducting the placement agent's fees and other estimated expenses. The Directors forecast that the Group currently has enough cash to fund its planned operations into the fourth quarter of 2023. If the Company does not secure additional funding before the fourth quarter of 2023  it will no longer be a going concern and would most probably be placed in Administration.The Directors have prepared cash flow forecasts and considered the cash flow requirement for the Group for the next three years including the period twelve months from the date of approval of the consolidated financial statements. These forecasts show that further financing will be required before the fourth quarter of 2023 assuming  inter alia  that certain development programs and other operating activities continue as currently planned.In the Director's opinion  the environment for financing of small and micro-cap biotech companies is as challenging as it has been since the financial crisis of 2008-10. While this may present acquisition and/or merger opportunities with other companies with limited or no access to financing  any attendant financings by Biodexa are likely to be dilutive. The Directors continue to evaluate financing options  including those connected to acquisitions and/or mergers  potentially available to the Group  including fundraising and the partnering of assets and technologies of the Company. The alternatives being considered are all at an early stage and are contingent upon the agreement of counterparties and accordingly  there can be no assurance that any of the alternative courses of action to finance the Company will be successful. This requirement for additional financing in the short term represents a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt upon the Group and parent company's ability to continue as a going concern. Should it become evident in the future that there are no realistic financing options available to the Company which are actionable before its cash resources run out then the Company will no longer be a going concern. In such circumstances  we would no longer be able to prepare financial statements under paragraph 25 of IAS 1. Instead  the financial statements would be prepared on a liquidation basis and assets would stated at net realizable value and all liabilities would be accelerated to current liabilities.The Directors believe there are adequate options and time available to secure additional financing for the Company and after considering the uncertainties  the Directors consider it is appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing these financial statements.Macroeconomic environmentThe United Kingdom completed its exit from the European Union (""EU"") on 31 January 2020 and the transition period concluded on 31 December 2020. A new trade agreement with the EU  the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement  was negotiated and became effective on 1 January 2021. The impact of the new trade agreement on the general and economic conditions in the United Kingdom remains uncertain. There may  for example be additional costs in materials and equipment sourced from the EU and we have experienced some delays in delivery timelines due to additional administration.The invasion by Russian Federation military in Ukraine in early 2022 had a destabilising impact on the global economy  including energy prices. Although there has been no immediate impact on the Group  it is not possible to assess the medium and long term impact of the conflict on the Group and the global economy generally.Environmental matters  community  human rights issues and employeesAs at 31 December 2022 the Group had 26 employees  of whom 18 were routinely based at its offices in Cardiff. Accordingly the Company believes it has a relatively modest environmental impact. All materials imported into the Company's laboratories are assessed for safety purposes and appropriate handling and storage safeguards imposed as necessary. Any small quantities of hazardous materials are removed by licensed waste management contractors. A number of policies and procedures governing expectations of ethical standards and the treatment of employees and other stakeholders are set out in the Company's Employee Handbook. The Company has also established an anti-slavery policy pursuant to the Modern Slavery Act 2015.The Company strives to be an equal opportunity employer  irrespective of race or gender. At 31 December 2022  the number of male/female employees was 50%/50%  the number of male/female senior managers was 86%/14% and the number of male/female Directors was 100%/0%.Strategic ReportGovernanceFinancial Statements07Biodexa Pharmaceuticals PLC?Annual Report and Accounts 2022Annual greenhouse gas emissionsWe measure our environmental performance by reporting our carbon footprint in terms of tonne CO2 equivalent. We report separately on our indirect emissions from consumption of electricity (Scope 2) and emissions consisting of employee travel in cars on Group business estimated on the basis of miles travelled (Scope 3). The Group have elected to monitor and report its energy efficiency using tonnes of CO2 per employee as an intensity ratio.MethodologyIn calculating the reported energy usage and equivalent greenhouse gas emissions the Group have referred to the HM Government Environment Reporting Guidelines and the GHG Reporting Protocol.

The Group has no immediate plans to improve energy efficiency.FINANCIAL REVIEW continued08Biodexa Pharmaceuticals PLC?Annual Report and Accounts 2022STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENTIn accordance with the QCA Code  as well as what is most likely to promote the success of the Group in the long term  the Board considers the interests of the Group's employees and other stakeholders in its decision-making and understands the importance of taking into account their views and considers the impact of the Group's activities on the community  environment and its reputation.Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 statementOur stakeholdersMaterial topicsEach Director of the Company is required to act in a way he/she considers  in good faith  would most likely promote the success of the Company for the benefit of its members as a whole. In this way  Section 172 requires a Director to have regard  amongst other matters  to the: ?likely consequences of any decision in the long term; ?interests of the Company's employees; ?need to foster the Company's business relationships with suppliers  customers and others; ?impact of the Company's operations on the community and the environment; ?desirability of the Company maintaining a reputation for high standards of business conduct; and ?need to act fairly as between members of the Company. In discharging its Section 172 responsibilities the Board has considered the factors set out above and the views of key stakeholders. The Board acknowledges that some decisions will not necessarily result in a positive outcome for all stakeholders. However  by considering the Company's purpose  mission  values and commitment to responsible business together with its strategic priorities and having a process in place for decision-making  the Board aims to ensure that its decisions are in the best interests of the business  taken as a whole.Collaboration partners We are engaged in R&D collaborations with our commercial partners to develop proof-of-concept formulations using our Q-Sphera technology. ?Project management ?Effective communication ?Setting and management of expectations ?Financial stabilityEmployees We are privileged to have a committed team of skilled employees based at our facilities in Cardiff.

We are careful to align our deliverables with the expectations of collaboration partners through discreet work packages with well-defined deliverables. We schedule regular meetings with our partners to appraise them of progress and resolve issues.Following our announcement of breakthrough data on the encapsulation of a protein using Q-Sphera technology while retaining its functional integrity  our R&D collaboration with Janssen was extended in January 2022 to include maximising drug loading and optimising in vitro duration of release for an undisclosed Janssen experimental large molecule.Our R&D collaboration with Janssen was further extended in March 2022 to include a second large molecule with the same R&D objectives. Janssen has expressed general satisfaction with progress.The Company attends relevant scientific conferences and partnering conferences to promote its science and technologies to prospective partners and/or licensees.EmployeesAlongside intellectual property  our employees are the Group's key asset. We engage with our employees through regular project team meetings. We also hold plenary ?all hands' meetings for employees on an ad hoc basis. We have a formal annual appraisal process which facilitates two-way feedback for our employees and their line managers.We hold regular meetings with sub-groups of employees to encourage innovation  sharing of ideas and knowledge. These meetings are usually at a technical level.In addition  from time-to-time we hold ?all-hands' or ?Town Hall' meetings which include corporate updates  sharing of success stories and dissemination of corporate goals for the upcoming period. Staff members are encouraged to surface issues and raise questions of management at these meetings and generally appreciate the engagement.ShareholdersWe strive to keep our shareholders informed through regulated contact. We offer conference calls and one-on-one meetings twice yearly to coincide with interim and year end results. We report important events through press releases  RNS and 6-Ks  some of which are supplemented with webinars. One-on-one meetings provide opportunities for shareholders to share their views.The Board considered the views of shareholders in the context of the proposed acquisition of Bioasis  proposed equity raise and change of name announced in December 2022. The Board considered the dilution that would be experienced by existing shareholders but concluded the proposed transactions could offer opportunities to create shareholder value in the medium term and was therefore in the best interests of the Company. A certain minority of shareholders voted against the Bioasis acquisition and financing which placed the Company close to Administration. In order to avoid this outcome the Board organised a ""cash box"" placing in February 2023 albeit on materially worse terms than the original financing. The Board re-positioned the Company as a therapeutics (vs drug delivery platform) company and restructured according]y in 2023 as discussed in the Chief Executive's Review.RegulatorsWe maintain a Quality Management System including a comprehensive suite of Standard Operating Procedures designed to ensure compliance with Good Laboratory Practice and Good Clinical Practice. We seek the advice of UK/European and US regulators in the design of clinical trials before their initiation. We supplement in-house expertise with consultants  Key Opinion Leaders and Contract Research Organisations  as appropriate.The Company has been ISO-9001 compliant since 2014.STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT continued10Biodexa Pharmaceuticals PLC?Annual Report and Accounts 2022RISK MANAGEMENTIdentification  assessment and mitigation of risk is a key function of the BoardThe Group has formal procedures to monitor and manage risk.Principal risks and uncertaintiesThe Directors consider the principal risks facing the business to be as follows:RegulationBiodexa operates in a highly regulated sector.Government authorities in the United Kingdom  United States and in other countries and jurisdictions  including the European Union  extensively regulate  among other things  the research  development  testing  manufacture  quality control  approval  distribution  sale  marketing  post-approval monitoring and reporting of pharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals  along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.The Company's strategy is to advance its clinical-stage assets through the clinic  generating proof-of-concept clinical data. The Company also deploys its drug delivery technologies to develop new formulations of partners' proprietary compounds to proof-of-concept stage before seeking to enter into a license with the partner company. Accordingly  the successful development  manufacture and commercialisation of its products will be dependent upon the expertise and compliance of its licensee partners with regulations. These include current Good Clinical Practice (""GCP"") and current Good Manufacturing Practice (""GMP"").Waste solutions and products are suitably disposed of under contract with a licensed provider for this purpose. Prior to disposal  hazardous waste materials are stored under appropriate conditions. Solvents and other inflammable reagents are stored in appropriate fire containment storage cabinets.Competition and technological advancesWith regard to MTX110  the Group's clinical-stage asset  there are a number of companies researching potential solutions for rare and orphan brain cancers including GBM and DIPG. Some of the competitor's programmes are more clinically advanced than Biodexa's.Biodexa's Q-Sphera sustained release technology relies on a novel manufacturing process that  the Directors believe  is unique in the pharmaceutical industry. Although competing sustained release technologies are well established in the market  the Q-Sphera platform has the potential for improved drug delivery kinetics and manufacturing efficiency.The Group's MidaSolve technology increases the aqueous solubility of small molecule cancer therapeutics to enable parenteral administration. This platform relies on internal know-how that uniquely applies prevailing chemistry techniques to enhance the solubility of poorly soluble or insoluble agents  enabling their targeted delivery and minimising systemic toxicity.The Group's MidaCore GNP platform is among the later generation of nanomedicine technologies. Liposomes followed by various polymeric nanoparticles were the first nanotechnologies and now inorganic nanoparticles like Biodexa GNPs are an emerging technology within the nanomedicine market.Commercial success of Biodexa's portfolio of development product candidates depends in part on the market's acceptance of these products and technologies. There can be no guarantee that this acceptance will be forthcoming or that Biodexa's technologies will succeed as an alternative to competing products. Furthermore  demand for Biodexa's products may decrease if competitor products are introduced with perceived advantages over Biodexa's product candidates.The speed and nature of technological change means that medicinal science is always evolving and new competition and alternatives are always a possibility. As a result of the combination of its platform technologies  intellectual property and proprietary know-how  the Group has a protected position in the sustained release  solubility enhancement and nanoparticle spaces which offer the potential for highly differentiated drugs serving high unmet needs  such as orphan oncology  to be rapidly and independently manufactured and scaled.Clinical development and regulatory riskThere can be no guarantee that any of the Group's products will obtain or maintain the necessary regulatory approvals in any or all of the territories in respect of which applications for such approvals are made. Where regulatory approvals are obtained  there can be no guarantee that the conditions attached to such approvals will not be considered too onerous by the Group or its distribution partners in order to be able to market its products effectively. The Group seeks to reduce this risk by developing products using safe  well-characterised active compounds  by seeking advice from regulatory advisers  consulting with regulatory approval bodies and by working with experienced distribution partners.Strategic ReportGovernanceFinancial Statements11Biodexa Pharmaceuticals PLC?Annual Report and Accounts 2022Financial risk management objectives and policiesThe Group is exposed to a variety of financial risks which result from both its operating and investing activities. The Board is responsible for coordinating the Group's risk management and focuses on actively securing the Group's short to medium term cash flows.Finance riskThe Group enters into very few transactions involving significant complexity  potential material financial exposure or atypical risk. The Group does not actively engage in the trading of financial assets and has no financial derivatives other than equity-settled derivative financial liabilities  as set out in note 19. The Group currently has only one customer  Janssen  a major subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson  and therefore considers there to be minimal if any credit risk. The Group no longer owns assets denominated in foreign currencies and  where assets and/or consumables are purchased in foreign currencies  such currency is purchased immediately upon invoice. The Group considers the major finance risk to be funding risk  as described below. Funding riskThe Group continues to incur substantial operating expenses. The IPO in December 2014 and subsequent fundraises in October 2016  October 2017  February 2019  October 2019  May 2020  July 2020  July 2021  December 2022 and most recently in February 2023  allowed the Group to advance the development pipeline products towards future value inflection points. However  until the Group generates positive net cash inflows from the out-licence or commercialisation of its development products it is expected to have to seek additional funding  whether through the injection of further equity capital from share issues  grants or debt finance. The Group may not be able to generate positive net cash inflows in the future or be able to attract such additional funding as may be required  either at all  or on suitable terms. In such circumstances the development programmes may be delayed or cancelled and business operations cut back.The Group seeks to reduce this risk by keeping a tight control on expenditure  avoiding long-term supplier contracts (other than for clinical trials)  prioritising development spend on products closest to potential revenue generation  obtaining government grants (where possible)  maintaining a focused portfolio of products under development and by keeping shareholders informed of progress.Political landscape and external riskIn the referendum in June 2016  voters approved the UK's exit from the European Union (""EU"") (commonly referred to as ""Brexit""). On 31 January 2020  the UK formally completed its exit from the EU and the transition period extended through 31 December 2020. A new trade agreement with the EU was negotiated and became effective on 1 January 2021. The impact of the new trade agreement on the general and economic conditions in the United Kingdom remains uncertain. There may  for example be additional costs in materials and equipment sourced from the EU and/or delays to delivery timelines due to additional administration.From a regulatory perspective  a basic requirement of EU law relating to the grant of a marketing authorisation for a medicinal product in the EU is that the applicant is established in the EU. The scope of a marketing authorisation for a medicinal product granted by the European Commission pursuant to the centralised procedure might not  in the future  include the UK. In these circumstances  an authorisation granted by competent UK authorities would be required to place medicinal products on the UK market.As noted above  the invasion by Russian Federation military in early 2022 in Ukraine has had a destabilising impact on the global economy  including energy prices. Although there has been no immediate impact on the Group  it is not possible to assess the medium and long term impact of the conflict on the Group and the global economy generally.Risk mitigationThe Group has formal procedures to monitor and mitigate risk. Some of the principal risks facing the Group include:Risk DescriptionMitigationChange from prior yearAvailability of fundingUntil the Group generates positive net cash inflows from the commercialisation of its development products it is expected to seek additional funding  whether through the injection of further equity capital from share issues  grant or debt finance. The Group may not be able to generate positive net cash inflows in the future or be able to attract such additional funding as may be required  either at all  or on suitable terms. In such circumstances the development programmes may be delayed or cancelled and business operations cut back. The risk of availability of funding is exacerbated by recent macroeconomic developments including Brexit  COVID-19 and the invasion of Ukraine. ?Securing fee-for-service contracts to formulate third parties' APIs together with development of an attractive in-house pipeline for licensing should provide additional cash flow to support operations. ?eScuring license and technology transfer agreements with third parties should result in the payment of upfront and success-based milestones to the Company. ?NASDAQ listing may provide access to additional funding sources.IncreasedRISK MANAGEMENT continued12Biodexa Pharmaceuticals PLC?Annual Report and Accounts 2022Risk DescriptionMitigationChange from prior yearCompetition/technological progressAlthough R&D is directed towards large market opportunities  existing and prospective competitors may have superior capabilities  and/or alternative products may become available. There is a risk of our products losing commercial viability in the fast-moving biotechnology sector. ?Keep a watching brief on drug delivery industry developments and academic outputs to identify generic competition and disruptive technology and products early. ?Protect our own technologies and products as broadly as possible with patents and trademarks. ?Review commercial relevance of the Group's technology platforms regularly. ?Direct innovation effort towards identified strengths and USPs. ?Examine opportunities to diversify the pipeline by adding additional sustained release projects.No changeObtaining/maintaining regulatory approvalThere can be no certainty that our products will receive regulatory approvals in the countries where we intend to operate  either within the timescale envisaged or at all. Regulations may also change after approval has been granted and subsequent regulatory difficulties with products may result in impositions against us. ?Develop products using safe  well-characterised active compounds. ?Seek early scientific and regulatory advice. ?Track the changing regulatory environment to ensure that we remain in compliance with all regulations and expectations.No changeCommercial viability of productsThere can be no assurance that our products will be commercially viable; the amounts and costs of production may not be acceptable for commercial use  or superior products may be developed. The ability to sell products at an acceptable cost would also be affected by healthcare reform and by access to appropriate sales channels and infrastructure in individual countries where we plan to operate. ?Maintain a detailed understanding of in-house platform technologies to maximise successful application thereof in Biodexa therapeutic areas  whether in relation to chemistry  manufacturing  development or commercialisation. ?Have clear go/no-go decision criteria allowing early identification of projects unlikely to succeed. ?Portfolio management to balance higher risk projects with lower risk projects. ?Hold Scientific and Therapeutic Advisory Board meetings to review the viability of the pipeline and allocate resources accordingly.No changeReimbursement by healthcare system payorsIn recent years  payors have increasingly required pharmaceutical companies to demonstrate the health economic benefits as well as clinical benefits of new drugs. A payor would not necessarily regard patient convenience as a health economic benefit and a prescription for an extended release or long-acting formulation of a drug could be substituted for a cheaper generic version of the drug if one is available. ?Monitor competitive environment  including life cycle of potential generic competitors. ?Include health economic benefits in designing Target Product Profiles for new development programmes.No changeStrategic ReportGovernanceFinancial Statements13Biodexa Pharmaceuticals PLC?Annual Report and Accounts 2022Risk DescriptionMitigationChange from prior yearDependence on third party manufacturing capabilityWe no longer operate our own in-house manufacturing facility and will therefore be reliant on third party contract manufacturers.

In the knowledge the Company's cash runway would run out in the first quarter of 2023 and in the absence of any near-term licensing milestones  we began looking for financing options in late Summer 2022. Despite a series of positive announcements during 2022  the Company's market capitalisation was at historically low levels and opportunities for financing were limited.Having considered the options available to the Company  including the impact of dilution on existing investors  the Board concluded that an acquisition of Bioasis  a company with a promising development pipeline  along with the Private Placement offered the opportunity for the enlarged Group to be repositioned as an emerging biotech company focused on the development of therapeutics for rare diseases supported by enabling drug delivery platforms. Alongside  and conditional upon  the acquisition of Bioasis  the Company secured a $10.0 million financing in the form of a Private Placement at a fixed price of $1.00 per ADS (approximately £0.033 per Ordinary Share). Special resolutions required to effect the acquisition of Bioasis and Private Placement were not passed at a General Meeting on 23 January 2023 and  accordingly  the acquisition and financing did not proceed.Faced with the real possibility of Administration  the Company engaged Quantuma Advisory Limited to advise the Board on appropriate actions to protect the interests of creditors and optimise outcomes for shareholders. After considerable effort  the Company was able to raise $6.0 million  albeit on materially worse terms than the $10.0 million Private Placement  using a non-pre-emptive cashbox structure.One of the more difficult decisions taken by the Board was to de-list the Company's Ordinary Shares from the AIM market. The Board concluded that AIM's rules which  in the case of reverse takeovers  require a company to effectively relist and publish an Admission document were likely to prove too restrictive for future potential transactions.The weeks leading up to the proposed acquisition of Bioasis followed by the adverse vote at the General Meeting on 23 January 2023 and the subsequent General Meeting on 24 March 2023 were periods of intense activity for the Board as every possible course of action was examined and decisions discussed with  and vetted by  advisers. In the 13 weeks from announcement of the proposed acquisition of Bioasis until posting of the Notice of General Meeting on 6 March 2023 there were 12 Board meetings.As the Board of a NASDAQ listed company we are committed to ensuring the Biodexa Group is managed in accordance with best practice and  through its Committees  the Board plays a key role in providing the necessary framework  challenge and support to the business and the executives by ensuring that a culture of good governance exists throughout the Biodexa Group.As Chairman  my role is to ensure that the Board operates in an open and transparent environment  allowing the Non-Executive Directors an opportunity to critically assess  challenge and support the CEO and senior management team.QCA CodeWith effect from 28 September 2018  all AIM listed companies were required to formally apply a recognised corporate governance code. Biodexa chose to adopt the principles of the QCA Code which identifies 10 principles to be followed in order for companies to deliver growth in long-term shareholder value  encompassing an efficient  effective and dynamic management framework  accompanied by good communication  to promote confidence and trust. I am pleased to say that  for the year ended 31 December 2022 we are able to report full compliance with each of the 10 principles of the QCA Code. Although we expect to continue to abide by the principles of the QCA Code  the Company is no longer AIM listed and will not be reporting its level of compliance going forward.Board of DirectorsThe Board's role is to establish the vision and strategy for the Biodexa Group and is responsible for the long-term success of the Company. The Board is responsible to the Company's shareholders with its main objective being to increase the sustainable value of assets and long-term viability of the Company. The Board reviews business opportunities and determines the risks and control framework. It also makes decisions on budgets  strategy and major capital expenditure. The day-to-day management of the business is delegated to the CEO and senior management team. The Board of Directors have decided that the roles of CEO and CFO can continue to be successfully combined.As at 31 December 2022 the Board comprised four Directors  three of whom were Non-Executive Directors  and the CEO  the only Executive Director.The Group regards all the Non-Executive Directors as independent.No remuneration is paid to any Non-Executive Directors in the form of shares. Sijmen de Vries holds share options granted by Midatech Limited  prior to the incorporation of Midatech Pharma PLC in 2014 (renamed Biodexa Pharmaceuticals PLC). The number of share options granted is trivial and do not impact his independence.Strategic ReportGovernanceFinancial Statements18Biodexa Pharmaceuticals PLC?Annual Report and Accounts 2022CHAIRMAN'S INTRODUCTION TO CORPORATE GOVERNANCE continuedRelationship with NASDAQThe Company's shares are listed on the NASDAQ market in the form of American Depositary Shares (ADSs). The Company's status as a Foreign Private Issuer means that we are permitted to follow English corporate law and the Companies Act 2006 with regard to certain aspects of corporate governance; such practices differ in significant respects from the corporate governance requirements applicable to US companies on NASDAQ.Following receipt of notification from NASDAQ on 31 January 2023 that the Company was not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement set forth in NASDAQ's rules for continued listing on The NASDAQ Capital Market  the Company effected an Ordinary Share consolidation on a one for 20 basis along with a change in ADS ratio from one ADS representing 25 Ordinary Shares to the new ratio of one ADS representing five Ordinary Shares  this was effective from 27 March 2023. NASDAQ Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) requires listed securities to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share  and Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) provides that a failure to meet the minimum bid price requirement exists if the deficiency continues for a period of 30 consecutive business days.Board and Committee meetingsThe Board and its Committees meet regularly to consider strategy  performance and the framework of internal controls. To enable the Board and/or its Committees to discharge its duties  all Directors receive appropriate and timely information. Briefing papers are distributed to all Directors in advance of Board meetings. The Company has established Audit  Remuneration  and Nomination Committees of the Board with formally delegated duties and responsibilities.The Audit CommitteeThe Audit Committee assists the Board in discharging its responsibilities with regard to financial reporting  the external audit and internal controls. This includes reviewing and monitoring the integrity of the Group's annual and interim financial statements  advising on the appointment of external auditors  reviewing and monitoring the extent of any non-audit work undertaken by external auditors  overseeing the Group's relationship with its external auditors  reviewing the effectiveness of the external audit process and reviewing the effectiveness of the Group's internal control review function. The ultimate responsibility for reviewing and approving the Annual Report and Accounts and the half-yearly reports remains with the Board.The Audit Committee is chaired by Simon Turton who is considered to have relevant financial experience  and its other members are Sijmen de Vries and Stephen Parker. Prior to Mr Stahel retiring in June 2022  he was also a member. During 2022  the Audit Committee met twice. The principal items considered by the Audit Committee included going concern and the completeness and accuracy of the Company's financial disclosures in its 2021 Annual Report  2021 20-F and 2022 interim report.The report of the Audit Committee for the year ended 31 December 2022 can be found on pages 20 to 21.The Remuneration CommitteeThe Remuneration Committee assists the Board in carrying out its responsibilities in relation to remuneration  including making recommendations to the Board on the Group's policy on executive remuneration  setting the over-arching principles  parameters and governance framework of the Group's remuneration policy and determining the individual remuneration and benefits package of each of the senior executives  including any payment of a discretionary bonus and the award of all share options. The Remuneration Committee ensures compliance with the QCA Code in relation to remuneration wherever possible.The Remuneration Committee is chaired by Sijmen de Vries  and its other members are Simon Turton and Stephen Parker. Prior to Mr Stahel retiring in June 2022  he was also a member. During 2022  the Remuneration Committee met once.

It is responsible for periodically reviewing the Board's structure and identifying potential candidates to be appointed as Directors or Committee members as the need may arise. The Nomination Committee is responsible for evaluating the balance of skills  knowledge and experience and the size  structure and composition of the Board and Committees of the Board  retirements and appointments of additional and replacement Directors and Committee members and will make appropriate recommendations to the Board on such matters.The Nomination Committee is chaired by Stephen Parker and its other members are all members of the Board. Prior to Mr Stahel retiring in June 2022  he was Chairman. The Nominations Committee met once in 2022 and considered the appointment of the new Non-Executive Chairman.19Biodexa Pharmaceuticals PLC?Annual Report and Accounts 2022Going concernAs disclosed in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 14 the Group financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis. The Directors have prepared cash flow forecasts and considered the cash flow requirement for the next three years  including the period 12 months from the date of the approval of the financial statements. These forecasts show that further financing will be required during the course of the next 12 months  assuming  inter alia  that certain development programs and other operating activities continue as currently planned. This requirement for additional financing represents a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt over about our ability to continue as a going concern. The Directors have a reasonable expectation based on previous fundraisings that the Group can access adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and therefore the Directors  after considering the uncertainties  consider it is appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.Relationship with shareholdersThe Directors seek to build and maintain a mutual understanding of objectives between the Company and its shareholders. The Company reports formally to shareholders in its Annual Report and Interim Statements setting out details of the Group's activities. In addition  the Company has kept shareholders informed of events and progress through the issue of regulatory news in accordance with the AIM Rules for Companies (""AIM Rules"") of the London Stock Exchange and the Foreign Private Issuer reporting requirements as set out in Rules 13a-16 or 15d-16 of the United States Securities Exchange Act of 1934. There is regular dialogue with financial stakeholders with the intention of providing transparent communication. The Chief Executive/Chief Financial Officer meets with institutional shareholders following interim and final results  has quarterly roadshows and hosts webinars for retail investors. The Chairman also makes himself available to liaise with shareholders as necessary. The Company also maintains investor relations pages and other information regarding the business  the Group's products and activities on its website at www.biodexapharma.com.SuppliersWe aim to work collaboratively with our suppliers to build long-term  mutually beneficial relationships. The Group is committed to eliminating unlawful discrimination and to promoting equality and diversity in its professional dealings with suppliers and other third parties. The Group endeavours to enter into clear and fair contracts with its suppliers.EmployeesOur people are the foundation of our business and imperative to its success. The Group promotes a positive working environment for all employees with rigorous policies and procedures that protect  develop and satisfy our existing and future employees.CommunityThe Group seeks to support as many interactions with the research and development community as possible through regular meetings and continuous collaborations.Health  safety and environmentThe Directors are committed to ensuring the highest standards of health and safety  both for their employees and for the communities within which the Group operates. The Directors are committed to minimising the impact of the Group's operations on the environment. During 2022 the Group set up a Green Initiative with the aim of improving sustainability at the headquarters and laboratory in Cardiff. The Annual Report is made available to shareholders at least 21 days before the Annual General Meeting (""AGM"") along with notice of the AGM. Directors are required to attend the AGM  unless unable to do so for personal reasons or due to pressing commercial commitments  and shareholders are given the opportunity to vote on each separate resolution proposed at the AGM. The Company counts all proxy votes and will indicate the level of proxies lodged for each resolution after it has first been dealt with by a show of hands.I would like to recognise the significant contribution made by Mr Rolf Stahel to the Group over many years as Non-Executive Chairman until his retirement in June 2022.Lastly  I would like to add my thanks to all stakeholders including you our shareholders  fellow Directors  employees and partners for their support during 2022.Stephen ParkerChairman28 April 2023Strategic ReportGovernanceFinancial Statements20Biodexa Pharmaceuticals PLC?Annual Report and Accounts 2022On behalf of the Board  I am pleased to present the report of the Audit Committee for the year ended 31 December 2022. The Committee monitors and reviews all aspects of the Group's financial reporting  risk management procedures and internal controls on behalf of the Board.The following report provides an overview of the work undertaken by the Committee during the year. The most significant topics considered by the Committee during the year included going concern. The Committee also reviewed the principal risk and mitigation disclosures  which are set out on pages 11 to 14.The Audit CommitteeThe Committee  which reports to the Board  is responsible for overseeing the Group's financial reporting process as well as monitoring the effectiveness of internal control  risk management and conduct of the external audit. It also monitors the independence of the external auditors and the provision of non-audit services  if any. The Audit Committee is chaired by Simon Turton who is considered to have significant  recent and relevant financial experience  and its other members are Sijmen de Vries and Stephen Parker. Prior to Mr Stahel retiring in June 2022  he was also a member.The Committee's meetings are also attended (by invitation) by the Chief Financial Officer  Group Financial Controller and senior representatives of the external auditor.External auditorThe Committee oversees the relationship with the external auditor and is responsible for developing and monitoring the Group's policy on external audit and for monitoring the external auditor's independence. The external auditor has direct access to the Committee Chairman should they wish to raise any matters outside of formal Committee meetings.The Committee monitors the external auditor's effectiveness on an ongoing basis  taking into account the views of management. The Committee is satisfied that Mazars remains independent and objective and that the Group is receiving a robust audit.Non-audit servicesDuring the year  fees in respect of non-audit services provided by Mazars were £70 000 (2021: £nil) in connection with the auditor responsibilities in respect of regulatory filings.The total fees charged by Mazars in the year are shown in note 4.Internal auditThe annual review of internal control and financial reporting procedures did not highlight any issues warranting the introduction of an internal audit function. It was concluded  given the current size and transparency of the operations of the Group and the robustness of the Group's accounting and business management systems  that an internal audit function was not required  however this remains a matter for ongoing review.Risk management and internal controlsThe Board has collective responsibility for risk management and is assisted by the Audit Committee in monitoring the principal risks and uncertainties faced by the Group  including those specific to the pharmaceutical sector  as well as other micro- and macroeconomic factors. The Board also considers risks specific to the Group  such as those relating to progress of the R&D programmes.The Board is responsible for reviewing and maintaining the Group's system of internal control and for monitoring its effectiveness. The system of internal control is designed to manage  rather than eliminate  the risk of failure of the achievement of business objectives and can only provide reasonable but not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.The Audit Committee continues to monitor and review the effectiveness of the system of internal control and report to the Board when appropriate with recommendations. As of the date of this report  the Audit Committee has not identified any weaknesses in the risk management and internal control systems of the Company.AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT21Biodexa Pharmaceuticals PLC?Annual Report and Accounts 2022The main features of the internal control system are outlined below: ?The Group uses SAP Business One accounting and business management software that supports a comprehensive and auditable purchasing control and approvals process.

Prior to Mr Stahel retiring in June 2022  he was also a member.Policy on Executive Directors' remunerationExecutive remuneration packages are designed to attract and retain executives of the necessary skill and calibre to run the Group  with reference to benchmarking comparable groups. The Remuneration Committee recommends remuneration packages to the Board by reference to individual performance. It also uses the knowledge and experience of the Committee members  published surveys relating to publicly traded companies and the pharmaceutical industry  as well as advice and external benchmarking from a UK remuneration specialist company and market changes generally. The Remuneration Committee has responsibility for recommending any long-term incentive schemes.The Board determines whether Executive Directors are permitted to serve in roles with other companies. Such permission is only granted where a role is on a strictly limited basis  where there are no conflicts of interest or competing activities and providing there is no adverse impact on the commitments required to the Group. Earnings from such roles are not disclosed to the Group.There are five main components of the remuneration package for the Executive Director:ComponentPurpose/ link to strategyOperationMaximumPerformance frameworkBase salaryTo provide a competitive component of fixed remuneration to attract and retain executives of the required calibre and experience.Base salaries are set by the Committee taking into account relevant factors such as the scope and responsibilities of the role. Salaries are normally reviewed annually and any adjustments become effective 1 April following the appraisal process.There is no prescribed maximum salary. Salary increases are viewed in the context of lower and median quartile salaries of executives in the biotech sector as reported by The UK Bioindustry Survey.While there are no performance targets attached to base salary  performance is a factor considered in the annual salary review process.BenefitsTo provide a competitive benefits packageBenefits are currently limited to healthcare and death in service life cover.Healthcare benefits are Group-wide BUPA plan and life cover is three times salary.N/APensionTo provide retirement benefits in line with Group policy.Provided through defined contribution schemes.Pension contributions range from 6% of salary to 10% of salary for the Executive Director.N/AAnnual bonusTo incentivise and reward annual performance and create further alignment with shareholders.Provides an opportunity for additional cash reward (up to a specified percentage of salary) based on annual performance targets set and assessed by the Committee. The bonus year runs from 1 January to 31 December and is time-apportioned for employees joining mid-year.The maximum may vary year to year. In 2022 the maximum was 150% of bonus entitlement (2021: 195%).Performance metrics are selected annually based on current business objectives. Typically  objectives include a mix of financial/liquidity objectives  R&D milestone objectives and business development objectives.23Biodexa Pharmaceuticals PLC?Annual Report and Accounts 2022ComponentPurpose/ link to strategyOperationMaximumPerformance frameworkShare optionsTo motivate and provide medium/long term incentives and rewards and align executive's interests with shareholders.Awards are normally made annually  after publication of the Company's Annual Report. Awards may also be made upon a new executive joining the Group. The exercise price of all granted options is the mid-market closing price the business day before the day of grant.The normal limit is set by HMRC at £250 000  measured as market price at time of grant.Awards may or may not have performance conditions attached to them. Historically  performance conditions have included share price appreciation and fundraising targets. More generally  share options vest 25% after one year and then equally over the following 12 quarters.The pay and employment conditions of non-Director employees were not taken into account in setting the components of the Executive Director's remuneration. Accordingly  non-Director employees were not consulted.Shareholder views on remunerationA resolution was passed at the 2022 AGM by shareholders approving the Company's remuneration policy with voting as follows: For: 12 433 235; Against: 8 559 137; Abstain: 270 589. This will next be brought before the shareholders at the 2025 AGM in line with the requirements of The Companies (Directors' Remuneration Policy and Directors' Remuneration Report) Regulations 2019. Other than by way of voting at the AGM  no views on Director's remuneration have been expressed by shareholders.Approach to recruitment remunerationSince IPO in December 2014  the Company has promoted one executive to the Board (Dr Cook) and recruited one Executive Director (Mr Stamp) to the Board. In determining appropriate remuneration packages  including salary  bonus and initial share option grant for prospective Executive Directors  the Remuneration Committee takes into consideration the experience and skills of the candidate  the remuneration packages of peers in the small cap biotech sector  the recommendations of the recruitment consultant (if any) and the internal salary structure of the Company. Should it become necessary  the Remuneration Committee would consider the payment of a bonus on joining the Company to offset benefits foregone such as a loyalty bonus from a Director's previous employer.Remuneration of the Executive DirectorMinimum and maximum remuneration of the Executive DirectorThe minimum and maximum remuneration of Mr Stamp  the sole Executive Director  is illustrated in the following chart:CEO RemunerationThe only variable component of Mr Stamp's remuneration is annual bonus which for 2022 was a minimum of zero and a maximum of 33% of salary with a 150% multiple applied if all objectives were met  being £113 850.No share options were granted to Mr Stamp during 2022.Base salaryBonus050 000100 000150 000200 000250 000400 000300 000350 000MinimumMaximumBase salary236 447236 447113 850Strategic ReportGovernanceFinancial Statements24Biodexa Pharmaceuticals PLC?Annual Report and Accounts 2022DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION REPORT continuedChief Executive remuneration since IPO in December 2014The following table illustrates the remuneration of the CEO since IPO in December 2014:20152016201720182019202020212022Stephen Stamp(1)?Total Remuneration (£)149 302233 867237 897?Bonus ? % of maximum0%60%0%?Options ? % of maximum24%56%?Craig Cook(2)?Total Remuneration (£)158 772357 521137 480?Bonus ? % of maximum0%75%0%?Options ? % of maximum?53%96%Jim Phillips(3)?Total Remuneration (£)377 289476 000309 157213 282?Bonus ? % of maximum85%60%0%0%?Options ? % of maximum?505%71%?(1) Mr Stamp was appointed CEO on 1 April 2020.(2) Dr Cook was appointed CEO on 1 June 2018 and resigned on 31 March 2020.(3) Dr Phillips was appointed CEO on 2 December 2014 and resigned on 31 May 2018.Base salary of the Executive DirectorThe annual salary of the Executive Director as of 1 January 2023 compared with 1 January 2022 was as follows:Effective 1 January 2023Effective 1 January 2022Percentage increaseStephen Stamp  CEO  CFO253 000198 00027.8%By mutual agreement  from August 2021  the Company ceased making contributions into Mr Stamp's personal pension plan.

Euronext is approaching the end of a ...,Euronext is approaching the end of a two-year hiring spree for its new clearing business as it continues to invest in the division as a core pillar of its future strategy.The exchange group set out plans at the end of 2021 to grow the Euronext Clearing’s headcount by 65% at the end of 2023  amounting to roughly 50 new hires across its risk  technology  sales and product development functions.As part of the growth  Euronext is also increasing its footprint in London  due to some of its largest clearing clients being based there  and in Paris  due to an existing large physically delivered derivatives contract.The exchange intends to keep its teams close to its key stakeholders. The core risk and technology functions will be in Rome and leveraged in Porto  and its sales functions in all of its locations where it has clients  but in particular in London and Paris.“What is important is to keep these critical functions inside the EU  close to the CCP’s authorities. We don’t want them offshore or in the UK. We want to regain strategic autonomy on post-trade and clearing specifically ” Euronext’s global head of primary markets and post-trade  Anthony Attia  told The TRADE.“We retain flexibility. The headcount depends also on future development. We have large clients in the UK and that’s not going to change. We will therefore have sales and development resources close to the relevant stakeholders. That’s a long-term investment.”Open accessEuronext obtained CC&G – now Euronext Clearing – in April 2021 as part of its acquisition of Borsa Italiana from the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) to alleviate competition concerns around its $27 billion Refinitiv deal.Since the completion of the deal  Euronext has been vocal around its intention to internalise its operations including clearing in Europe. For cash equities  Euronext Clearing will be the preferred clearing house for Euronext’s markets  however for other trading services for derivatives  commodities futures and repo clearing the preferred clearing model does not currently exist and so Euronext Clearing will clear all of the flow.However  Attia confirmed that further open access measures for other non-Euronext trading venues were not out of the question.“Preferred CCP model is a part of open access ” Attia said. “There is strong demand for us to offer clearing services across the different trading venues and asset classes . We’ll definitely look at expanding as soon as possible to be able to clear non-Euronext trading venues as that’s what our clients want.”Read more – Euronext continues European internalisation with Borsa Italiana migration to proprietary trading platformIn January  the exchange operator confirmed it was set to pay €36 million to LSEG’s clearing house LCH SA in exchange for the early termination of its derivatives clearing agreement. The ongoing clearing migration is expected to contribute significantly to €115 million in synergies by the end of 2024.In April  Euronext completed the migration of Borsa Italiana’s equities and ETF businesses to its proprietary trading platform  Optiq  removing the need to pay LSEG for the use of its technology in the future.The exchange expects listed derivatives and commodities markets across Amsterdam  Brussels  Lisbon  Oslo Børs and Paris to move to Euronext Clearing by the third quarter of 2024. Euronext Milan’s listed derivatives business is already cleared by Euronext Clearing.Last week  Euronext appointed Roberto Pecora as chief executive officer and general manager of Euronext Clearing  effective from 3 July.
