After a recent lull in importer demand  Saudi Arabia’s General Food Security Authority (GFSA) on Thursday issued an international tender to buy 480 000 tonnes of wheat for delivery in September and October. “This is the first major Middle East/North African tender since Algeria in early May so hopefully other importers could follow ” one German trader said.“But Russian exporters have already told me today they will be offering briskly in the Saudi tender.” Traders again noted large and cheap sale offers for 50 000 tonnes of Russian 12.5% protein milling wheat of the same type sought by Saudi Arabia for July shipment at $230 a tonne FOB.“I think $230 a tonne FOB for Russian wheat is also achievable for the September/October shipment periods sought by Saudi.
