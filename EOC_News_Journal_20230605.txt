The Offering consists of a maximum of 5 871 448 new shares (the ""Offer Shares"").SummaryApproximately maximum of EUR 2.9 million before transaction costs may be raised in the Offering if fully subscribed.The Offering is secured to approximately 27.3 per cent by subscription undertakings from the existing shareholders.BBS will give all its shareholders registered in BBS's shareholder register maintained by Euroclear Finland Ltd (""Euroclear Finland"") or Euroclear Sweden AB (""Euroclear Sweden"") one (1) book-entry subscription right (the ""Subscription Right"") for each share held on the Offering record date.

The estimated processing time by the authority was 8 to 12 months from filing. However  according to a survey published by Medtech Europe*  processing times have lengthened since then  so that approvals for new products are now taking more than a year to be issued  one year being the target time. The delays are typically caused by the authorities being overburdened  since because of the new Medical Device Regulation old products need to be re-certified.As a result of a delay in the processing of the CE marking application  the Company is obliged to raise bridge funding in order to secure continued operations up until the CE marking is granted. Nevertheless  the approval process for the BBS ARTEBONE® Paste has progressed well. The first audit was conducted in November 2022 and the following one in March 2023. The vitally important product classification decision was received by the Company in May 2023. The Company expects the CE marking application to be approved by the end of the year 2023.The Company anticipates that the net proceeds raised through the Offering will be used for executing the Company's business plan  strengthening working capital and investments  and managing and repaying loans  including but not limited to the following items:1. The principal purpose of the proceeds to be raised is the successful completion of the application process for a CE marking for the BBS bone implant ARTEBONE® Paste  including certification of the Company's quality system. The funds will also be used for product development  patent portfolio maintenance and production development  and also for the FDA approval application process for gaining marketing authorisation for ARTEBONE® Paste on the US market.2. For initiating the commercialisation of ARTEBONE® Paste  including sales and marketing asset recruitment and training  preparation of marketing materials as well as assessing and contacting initial potential customers.3. For payment of principal instalments and interest of EUR 0.7 million in TEKES loans that are due in the next 12 months.The estimate of how the proceeds are intended to be used is based on the assumption that the Offering will be subscribed in full.The estimated portions of the use of proceeds may differ depending on the amount of funds raised and the development of business operations. If the Offering is not subscribed in full  it may not be possible to carry out the planned actions in full  and cost-cutting measures will need to be introduced  which in turn may delay the start of production  marketing and sales.* MedTech Europe Survey report. https://www.medtecheurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/medtech-europe-survey-report-analysing-the-availability-of-medical-devices-in-2022-in-connection-to-the-medical-device-regulatio -implementation.pdfTerms of the OfferingThe Company will offer maximum of 5 871 448 Offer Shares for subscription in accordance with the shareholders' preferential subscription right.

The number of Option Rights TO2 was 335 481  entitling their holders to subscribe a maximum of 335 481 new Company shares. The subscription period for exercising Option Rights TO2 to subscribe shares was 22 May to 2 June 2023. The subscription price for these shares was determined by the average Company share price  weighted by trading volume  on First North Finland between 8 and 18 May 2023  minus 25% and it was EUR 0.65 or SEK 7.38 per share.Since the subscription price of the shares with Option Rights TO2 was higher than the subscription price used in the Offering and because the investors who subscribed shares with Option Rights TO2 are unable to participate in the Offering with the new shares subscribed with Option Rights TO2 due to the time schedule of the Offering  the Company's Board of Directors has decided to transfer shares held by the Company without consideration to investors who have subscribed for shares based on Option Rights TO2  so that one (1) share will be given for each five (5) shares subscribed for with the Option Rights TO2. The Board of Directors considers that  in this case  the equal treatment of shareholders constitutes a particularly weighty financial reason for the directed transfer of shares without consideration from the point of view of the Company and taking into account the interests of all its shareholders.AdvisersAalto Capital Partners Oy is acting as financial advisor to the Company in the Offering.
