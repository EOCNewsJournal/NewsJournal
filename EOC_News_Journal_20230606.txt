The Offering consists of a maximum of 5 871 448 new shares (the ""Offer Shares"").SummaryApproximately maximum of EUR 2.9 million before transaction costs may be raised in the Offering if fully subscribed.The Offering is secured to approximately 27.3 per cent by subscription undertakings from the existing shareholders.BBS will give all its shareholders registered in BBS's shareholder register maintained by Euroclear Finland Ltd (""Euroclear Finland"") or Euroclear Sweden AB (""Euroclear Sweden"") one (1) book-entry subscription right (the ""Subscription Right"") for each share held on the Offering record date.

The estimated processing time by the authority was 8 to 12 months from filing. However  according to a survey published by Medtech Europe*  processing times have lengthened since then  so that approvals for new products are now taking more than a year to be issued  one year being the target time. The delays are typically caused by the authorities being overburdened  since because of the new Medical Device Regulation old products need to be re-certified.As a result of a delay in the processing of the CE marking application  the Company is obliged to raise bridge funding in order to secure continued operations up until the CE marking is granted. Nevertheless  the approval process for the BBS ARTEBONE® Paste has progressed well. The first audit was conducted in November 2022 and the following one in March 2023. The vitally important product classification decision was received by the Company in May 2023. The Company expects the CE marking application to be approved by the end of the year 2023.The Company anticipates that the net proceeds raised through the Offering will be used for executing the Company’s business plan  strengthening working capital and investments  and managing and repaying loans  including but not limited to the following items:1. The principal purpose of the proceeds to be raised is the successful completion of the application process for a CE marking for the BBS bone implant ARTEBONE® Paste  including certification of the Company’s quality system. The funds will also be used for product development  patent portfolio maintenance and production development  and also for the FDA approval application process for gaining marketing authorisation for ARTEBONE® Paste on the US market.2. For initiating the commercialisation of ARTEBONE® Paste  including sales and marketing asset recruitment and training  preparation of marketing materials as well as assessing and contacting initial potential customers.3. For payment of principal instalments and interest of EUR 0.7 million in TEKES loans that are due in the next 12 months.The estimate of how the proceeds are intended to be used is based on the assumption that the Offering will be subscribed in full.The estimated portions of the use of proceeds may differ depending on the amount of funds raised and the development of business operations. If the Offering is not subscribed in full  it may not be possible to carry out the planned actions in full  and cost-cutting measures will need to be introduced  which in turn may delay the start of production  marketing and sales.* MedTech Europe Survey report. https://www.medtecheurope.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/medtech-europe-survey-report-analysing-the-availability-of-medical-devices-in-2022-in-connection-to-the-medical-device-regulatio -implementation.pdfTerms of the OfferingThe Company will offer maximum of 5 871 448 Offer Shares for subscription in accordance with the shareholders' preferential subscription right.

The number of Option Rights TO2 was 335 481  entitling their holders to subscribe a maximum of 335 481 new Company shares. The subscription period for exercising Option Rights TO2 to subscribe shares was 22 May to 2 June 2023.

The Board of Directors considers that  in this case  the equal treatment of shareholders constitutes a particularly weighty financial reason for the directed transfer of shares without consideration from the point of view of the Company and taking into account the interests of all its shareholders.AdvisersAalto Capital Partners Oy is acting as financial advisor to the Company in the Offering.

Pont  Christian Jacques  Julio Delgado AbstractPoster presentation on9 June 2023  18:00 - 19:00 CETAt the safety and efficacy analysis cut-off date of 9 January 2023  7 patients diagnosed with rrCLL (including 4 patients with RT) were enrolled in the EUPLAGIA-1 study (n=4 at dose level 1 (DL1); n=3 at dose level 2 (DL2)). All patients received GLPG5201 as a fresh infusion with a median vein-to-vein time of 7 days. The dose levels that are evaluated in the Phase 1 part of the study are 35x106 (DL1)  100x106 (DL2) and 300x106 (dose level 3 (DL3)) CAR+ viable T cells.The initial results from these 7 patients that were eligible for efficacy analysis (cut-off date: 9 January 2023) indicated that a 7-day vein-to-vein time is feasible and demonstrated strong and consistent in vivo CAR-T expansion levels. Moreover  the initial efficacy results are encouraging with an objective response rate (ORR) of 100% observed. 6 out of 7 patients (86%) reached a complete response (CR) and all Richter’s patients achieved a CR. A duration of response of up to 7.9 months has been reported and follow-up is ongoing. Only 1 patient (DL1) progressed (progressive disease  (PD) after partial response (PR)) and had a CD19-negative relapse with confirmed RT.In the safety analysis of these 7 patients  adverse events were consistent with the known toxicities of CD19 CAR-T treatment. None of the patients experienced a CRS higher than grade 2 at both dose levels and no ICANS was reported. No dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) were reported and the majority of grade ≥3 adverse events were hematological. Only one serious adverse event was reported at DL2 with a patient experiencing a CRS grade 2  but the event was resolved after 7 days. Patient recruitment of the study is ongoing.About point-of-care manufacturingCellPoint (a Galapagos company) has developed  in a strategic collaboration with Lonza  a novel point-of-care supply model  which is designed to enable clinicians to administer fresh CAR-T cells within 7 days of leukapheresis  without complex logistics or cryopreservation  thereby aiming to address important limitations of current CAR-T treatments. The proprietary platform consists of CellPoint’s end-to-end xCellit workflow management and monitoring software  and Lonza’s Cocoon® Platform  a functionally closed  automated manufacturing platform for cell therapies. This novel point-of-care model is compliant with the EMA and FDA guidance for clinical trials.About the EUPLAGIA-1 study (EudraCT 2021-003815-25)EUPLAGIA-1 is an ongoing Phase 1/2 open-label  multi-center study evaluating the feasibility  safety  and efficacy of point-of-care manufactured GLPG5201 in patients with rrCLL and small cell lymphocytic lymphoma (rrSLL)  with or without RT. GLPG5201 is a second generation anti-CD19/4-1BB CAR-T product candidate  administered as intravenous infusion of a fresh product candidate in a single fixed dose. Patients with CD19+ rrCLL or rrSLL with ≥2 lines of prior therapy are eligible to participate  and patients with RT are eligible regardless of prior therapy. The primary objective of the Phase 1 part of the study is to evaluate safety and determine the recommended dose for the Phase 2 part of the study. The primary objective of the Phase 2 part of the study is to assess the ORR and the secondary objectives include the analysis of the complete response rate (CRR)  duration of response  progression free survival  overall survival  safety pharmacokinetic profile  and feasibility of point-of-care manufacturing.The dose levels that are evaluated in the Phase 1 part of the study are 35x106 (DL1)  100x106 (DL2) and 300x106 (DL3) CAR+ viable T cells. The study uses a Bayesian Optimal Interval (BOIN) design (n=15 patients) for Phase 1. Following screening and enrolment  patients will receive ibrutinib daily until leukapheresis of mononuclear cells. During GLPG5201 manufacturing  patients receive cyclophosphamide (300 mg/m2/day)/fludarabine (30 mg/m2/day) for 3 days. After a resting period of at least 2 days  GLPG5201 is administered via intravenous infusion. All patients remain hospitalized for at least 7 days and the end-of-study visit is at Week 14 post CAR-T infusion. Phase 1 patient recruitment is ongoing to establish a recommended dose for Phase 2.About chronic lymphocytic leukemia and small cell lymphocytic lymphomaChronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is one of the chronic lymphoproliferative disorders (lymphoid neoplasms). It is characterized by a progressive accumulation of functionally incompetent lymphocytes  which are usually monoclonal in origin. CLL and small cell lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) are essentially the same type of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL)  with the only difference the location where the primary cancer occurs. CLL affects B-cells in the blood and bone marrow and SLL cancer cells are located in lymph nodes and/or the spleen3. RT is an uncommon clinicopathological condition observed in patients with CLL. It is characterized by the sudden transformation of the CLL into a significantly more aggressive form of large cell lymphoma and occurs in approximately 2-10% of all CLL patients. CLL/SLL usually follows an indolent course and is an incurable disease. Patients who develop relapsed and refractory disease and become resistant to new agents have a dismal prognosis and a high unmet medical need for new therapeutic options such as CAR-T cells. With estimated incidence of 4.7 new cases per 100 000 individuals  CLL/SLL are the most prevalent lymphoid malignancies and are the most common adult leukemias in the US and in Europe 4.About GalapagosGalapagos is a fully integrated biotechnology company united around a single purpose: to transform patient outcomes through life-changing science and innovation for more years of life and quality of life.

During the General Assembly that was held on 28 April 2023  the shareholders were informed of the concrete procedures relating to the optional dividend  including in particular the issue price  reference period and the option period. However  following a drop in the share price during the option period  the discount offered to shareholders on the reference price (used to determine the issue price) has been considerably reduced. In accordance with the provisions of the initial information document (article 3.8)  the Board of Directors has decided to cancel this optional dividend  including the acceptances received. After a new reference period  the Board of Directors decided on 5 June 2023 to launch a new optional dividend.The capital increase through the contribution of dividend entitlements will take place on 27 June and will be realized within the scope of the authorised capital.This method of paying the dividend will allow to strengthen the group's equity  improve the balance sheet ratios and retain liquidities in order to continue the development of all the projects in portfolio.We are happy to announce that the group's major shareholders have expressed their intention to massively opt for the conversion of their dividend entitlements in capital.""Stéphan Sonneville SA  Managing DirectorThe General Assembly of the Shareholders held on 28 April 2023 decided to distribute a gross dividend of € 2.87 per share relating to FY 2022.The dividend net of withholding tax will amount to € 1.869 per ordinary share (30% withholding tax). The security entitling the holder to a dividend is coupon number 18.Within the framework of this optional dividend  the shareholders will have the choice between:the contribution of their net dividend entitlements  in exchange for new shares;the payment of the dividend in cash; ora combination of the two aforementioned options.In the event of the contribution of the net dividend entitlement to the capital  the issue price per new share is set at20.559 .It was based on the average closing stock market price of the share during the reference period (from 22 May 2023 till 2 June 2023 included) on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels  being € 26.58.This average price was then calculated with a discount on the issue price to the multiple of the net dividend of € 1.869  i.e. 11 shares.This multiple constitutes the exchange ratio (number of coupons necessary to subscribe a new share). The application of this multiple leads to the determination of the issue price  which provides a discount on the average price (ex-coupon) during the reference period ending on 2 June 2023 amounting to 22.7%.The option period during which the shareholders can subscribe to the capital increase will take place from Wednesday  7 June 2023 at 9.00am (Belgian time) till Tuesday  20 June 2023 at 16.00pm (Belgian time) included.Shareholders who do not express a choice during this option period and in the way stipulated for this purpose will receive the dividend in cash.",neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.23,0.31,0.46,True,English,"['Press release', 'Optional dividend', 'ATENOR', 'average closing stock market price', 'Stéphan Sonneville SA', 'initial information document', 'balance sheet ratios', 'two aforementioned options', 'The General Assembly', 'net dividend entitlement', 'new optional dividend', 'new reference period', 'regulated market', 'average price', 'reference price', 'issue price', 'Gross dividend', 'option period', 'Press release', 'La Hulpe', 'Managing Director', 'withholding tax', 'Euronext Brussels', 'Belgian time', 'new shares', 'share price', 'capital increase', 'authorised capital', 'concrete procedures', 'ordinary share', 'exchange ratio', 'major shareholders', 'coupon number', 'entitlements', '11 shares', 'distribution', '5 June', 'Board', 'Directors', 'Atenor', 'possibility', '28 April', 'drop', 'discount', 'accordance', 'provisions', 'article', 'acceptances', 'contribution', 'place', '27 June', 'scope', 'method', 'group', 'equity', 'liquidities', 'order', 'development', 'projects', 'portfolio', 'intention', 'conversion', 'FY', 'security', 'framework', 'choice', 'payment', 'cash', 'combination', 'event', '22 May', '2 June', 'coupons', 'application', 'multiple', 'determination', 'Wednesday', '9.00am', 'Tuesday', '16.00pm', 'way', 'purpose', '22.']",2023-06-05,2023-06-06,marketscreener.com

We are proud of the pre-clinical results presented and remain deeply focused on the development of our product candidates to deliver breakthrough treatments that could benefit thousands of patients worldwide ” said André Choulika  Ph.D.  Chief Executive Officer at Cellectis.Oral PresentationUCART20x22: allogeneic dual CAR T-cells for the treatment of B-cell malignanciesAutologous CAR T-cell therapies have shown outstanding responses in the treatment of selected blood cancers  predominantly B-cell malignancies. Nevertheless  long term studies revealed that some patients treated with CD19 or CD22 CAR T-cells can relapse due to low target antigen expression in tumor cells or to antigen loss. The therapeutic options after CAR T-cell relapses are limited  emphasizing the need to develop novel therapies to improve current survival rates. There is also need for allogeneic “off-the-shelf” therapies that could be readily available at the time of treatment decision and overcome limitations of current autologous approaches.UCART20x22 is Cellectis’ first dual-targeting  allogeneic cell therapy product candidate targeting CD20 and CD22  to address the current challenges in the treatment of B-cell malignancies.UCART20x22 features TALEN®-mediated disruptions of the TRAC gene (to minimize the risk of graft-versus-host disease) and of the CD52 gene (to permit use of a CD52-directed monoclonal antibody in patients’ lymphodepletion regimen) to enhance CAR T engraftment  expansion  and persistence.Cellectis demonstrates that UCART20x22 displays robust activity in vitro and in vivo  against targets expressing heterogeneous levels of CD22 and CD20. We have used in vitro cytotoxicity assays against different tumor cell lines  showing strong activity whether these cells express a single antigen (CD20 or CD22) or both antigens simultaneously  as well as IFNg release in response to antigen specific stimulation.The oral presentation highlighted the following preclinical data:Robust in vitro and in vivo cytolytic activity against tumors expressing different antigen combinations.Efficient in vitro targeting of primary B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (B-NHL) samples harboring different CD20 and CD22 expression levels  suggesting that UCART20x22 has the potential to reach a large patient population.Dose dependent tumor control in vivo  using batches manufactured internally  harboring a tumor cell line as well as in a Patient Derived Xenograft (PDX) model of B-NHL.Overall  Cellectis provided pre-clinical proof-of-concept data for a first allogeneic dual CAR T-cell to overcome current mechanisms of resistance to CAR T-cell therapies in B-NHL  while providing a potential therapeutic alternative to CD19 targeting and allowing to reduce the time from treatment decision to infusion.UCART20x22 is currently evaluated in the NATHALI-01 Phase 1/2a clinical study in patients with relapsed/refractory B-NHL (NCT05607420).The oral presentation is available on Cellectis’ website: https://www.cellectis.com/en/investors/scientific-presentations/Poster Presentations:Non-viral DNA delivery associated to TALEN® gene editing leads to highly efficient correction of sickle cell mutation in long-term repopulating hematopoietic stem cellsSickle cell disease stems from a single point mutation in the HBB gene which results in sickle hemoglobin. For patients who are not eligible for an allogeneic stem cell transplantation  nuclease-based gene therapy approaches provide a relevant therapeutic alternative to restore functional hemoglobin production.Cellectis leveraged TALEN® technology to develop a gene editing process leading to highly efficient HBB gene correction via homology directed repair  while mitigating potential risks associated to HBB gene knock-out. Furthermore  we compared viral (TALEN-V) and non-viral (TALEN-NV) DNA template delivery strategies in mobilized healthy donor (HD) or non-mobilized homozygous sickle patient (HbSS) hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs).Both strategies led to high and comparable efficiencies of HBB gene correction in vitro in HD and HbSS  without affecting viability  purity or clonogenic potential of corrected HSPCs.The poster presentation highlighted the following data:TALEN®-mediated engineering efficiently corrects the mutated HBB gene in clinically relevant HSPCs and promote phenotype correction in fully mature RBCs.Cellectis optimized TALEN® gene editing process mitigates potential safety challenges by reducing the frequency of HBB gene inactivation (<10% β-thal cells).Non-viral DNA template-mediated HBB repair mitigates p53 DNA damage response activation  preserves edited LT-HSCs fitness and enables their efficient engraftment in vivo using an immunodeficient murin model.These results show that non-viral DNA delivery associated to TALEN® gene editing reduces the toxicity usually observed with viral DNA delivery and allows high levels of HBB gene correction in long-term repopulating hematopoietic stem cells.The poster presentation is available on Cellectis’ website: https://www.cellectis.com/en/investors/scientific-presentations/Comprehensive Analysis of the Editing Window of TALE Base EditorsOne of the most recent advances in the genome editing field has been the addition of the so-called “C-to-T TALE base editors” (TALE-BE)  an innovative platform for cell therapy that relies on the deamination of cytidines within double strand DNA  through the formation of an uracil (U) intermediate. These molecular tools are fusions of a transcription activator-like effector (TALE) domain for the binding of a specific DNA sequence  split-DddA deaminase halves that will catalyze the conversion of a cytosine (C) to a thymine (T) upon reconstitution  and an uracil glycosylase inhibitor (UGI).Cellectis aimed to systematically investigate the influence of the sequence context surrounding the targeted Cytosine on TALE-BE C to T conversion efficiency.Recently we developed a strategy that allowed us to comprehensively characterize editing efficiencies in function of the TC position within the TALE-BE editing windows. This method is specifically taking advantage of the highly precise and efficient TALEN mediated ssODN knock-in in primary T cells  allowing to focus on how target composition and spacer variations can affect TALE-BE activity/efficiency.The poster presentation highlighted the following data:Determined optimal spacer length (13/15 bp) for highly efficient TALE-BE for both C40/C40 and C11/C11 scaffolds.Determined optimal common sequence context for high editing rates.Determined that editing efficiency of the C11/C11 scaffold is highly dependent on Cytosine position requirements  resulting in more stringent activity in a context of 15 bp spacer size and decreasing the effects of bystander editing.Overall  we believe that the knowledge obtained will allow to better design efficient TALE-BE while improving the specificity profiles of this innovative editing platform.The poster presentation is available on Cellectis’ website: https://www.cellectis.com/en/investors/scientific-presentations/About CellectisCellectis is a clinical-stage biotechnology company using its pioneering gene-editing platform to develop life-saving cell and gene therapies.

In preclinical studies conducted by the Company  BEN-34712 was neuroprotective in a patient-derived  disease-relevant in vitro motor neuron/iAstrocyte co-culture model  demonstrating significant efficacy in both sporadic and familial subtypes of ALS. In addition  BEN-34712 has demonstrated both central nervous system (CNS) target engagement and functional protective effects in the SOD1G93A mouse model of ALS after 50-day repeat dosing.BenevolentAI collaborated with the Sheffield Institute for Translational Neuroscience (SITraN) at the University of Sheffield on this programme  utilising their patient-derived motor neuron/iAstrocyte co-culture systems and in vivo model expertise.Anne Phelan  Chief Scientific Officer  BenevolentAI  said: “There remains a significant and urgent need for new and alternative therapies for patients with ALS. We are pleased by the promising advancement of our drug candidate  BEN-34712  towards clinical development  backed by the compelling preclinical data generated by our collaborators at SITraN.”Richard Mead  Senior Lecturer in Translational Neuroscience at SITraN  commented: ""ALS patients suffering from this devastating neurodegenerative disease are in dire need of effective therapy  with the current standard of care options focusing on symptom management or offering limited clinical benefit. We believe BEN-34712 represents an exciting development in our research for a potential new treatment  particularly as it shows effectiveness in both the SOD1G93A mouse model system as well as familial and C9orf72 related ALS patient-derived cell models.""About ALSALS is a progressive neurologic disorder characterised by the loss of cortical and spinal motor neurons  leading to the denervation of nerve endplates  axonal retraction and subsequent muscle atrophy. The average survival time following the initial diagnosis is around two-three years  and while there are drugs approved by the US FDA for ALS  they provide only modest benefits to patients  underwriting the urgent need for new and alternative therapies.About BenevolentAIBenevolentAI (AMS: BAI) is a leading developer of advanced artificial intelligence technologies that unlock the value of multimodal data  surface novel insights  and accelerate biomedical discovery. Through the combined capabilities of its AI platform  its scientific expertise  and wet-lab facilities  the Company is developing an in-house drug pipeline of high-value assets. The Company is headquartered in London  with a research facility in Cambridge (UK) and a further office in New York.​​About SITraN at the University of SheffieldThe Sheffield Institute for Translational Neuroscience (SITraN) is an essential development in the fight against motor neurone disease and other common neurodegenerative disorders  including Parkinson's and dementia  as well as stroke and multiple sclerosis.

Pont  Christian Jacques  Julio Delgado AbstractPoster presentation on9 June 2023  18:00 - 19:00 CETAt the safety and efficacy analysis cut-off date of 9 January 2023  7 patients diagnosed with rrCLL (including 4 patients with RT) were enrolled in the EUPLAGIA-1 study (n=4 at dose level 1 (DL1); n=3 at dose level 2 (DL2)). All patients received GLPG5201 as a fresh infusion with a median vein-to-vein time of 7 days. The dose levels that are evaluated in the Phase 1 part of the study are 35x106 (DL1)  100x106 (DL2) and 300x106 (dose level 3 (DL3)) CAR+ viable T cells.The initial results from these 7 patients that were eligible for efficacy analysis (cut-off date: 9 January 2023) indicated that a 7-day vein-to-vein time is feasible and demonstrated strong and consistent in vivo CAR-T expansion levels. Moreover  the initial efficacy results are encouraging with an objective response rate (ORR) of 100% observed. 6 out of 7 patients (86%) reached a complete response (CR) and all Richter’s patients achieved a CR. A duration of response of up to 7.9 months has been reported and follow-up is ongoing. Only 1 patient (DL1) progressed (progressive disease  (PD) after partial response (PR)) and had a CD19-negative relapse with confirmed RT.In the safety analysis of these 7 patients  adverse events were consistent with the known toxicities of CD19 CAR-T treatment. None of the patients experienced a CRS higher than grade 2 at both dose levels and no ICANS was reported. No dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) were reported and the majority of grade ≥3 adverse events were hematological. Only one serious adverse event was reported at DL2 with a patient experiencing a CRS grade 2  but the event was resolved after 7 days. Patient recruitment of the study is ongoing.About point-of-care manufacturingCellPoint (a Galapagos company) has developed  in a strategic collaboration with Lonza  a novel point-of-care supply model  which is designed to enable clinicians to administer fresh CAR-T cells within 7 days of leukapheresis  without complex logistics or cryopreservation  thereby aiming to address important limitations of current CAR-T treatments. The proprietary platform consists of CellPoint’s end-to-end xCellit workflow management and monitoring software  and Lonza’s Cocoon® Platform  a functionally closed  automated manufacturing platform for cell therapies. This novel point-of-care model is compliant with the EMA and FDA guidance for clinical trials.About the EUPLAGIA-1 study (EudraCT 2021-003815-25)EUPLAGIA-1 is an ongoing Phase 1/2 open-label  multi-center study evaluating the feasibility  safety  and efficacy of point-of-care manufactured GLPG5201 in patients with rrCLL and small cell lymphocytic lymphoma (rrSLL)  with or without RT. GLPG5201 is a second generation anti-CD19/4-1BB CAR-T product candidate  administered as intravenous infusion of a fresh product candidate in a single fixed dose. Patients with CD19+ rrCLL or rrSLL with ≥2 lines of prior therapy are eligible to participate  and patients with RT are eligible regardless of prior therapy. The primary objective of the Phase 1 part of the study is to evaluate safety and determine the recommended dose for the Phase 2 part of the study. The primary objective of the Phase 2 part of the study is to assess the ORR and the secondary objectives include the analysis of the complete response rate (CRR)  duration of response  progression free survival  overall survival  safety pharmacokinetic profile  and feasibility of point-of-care manufacturing.The dose levels that are evaluated in the Phase 1 part of the study are 35x106 (DL1)  100x106 (DL2) and 300x106 (DL3) CAR+ viable T cells. The study uses a Bayesian Optimal Interval (BOIN) design (n=15 patients) for Phase 1. Following screening and enrolment  patients will receive ibrutinib daily until leukapheresis of mononuclear cells. During GLPG5201 manufacturing  patients receive cyclophosphamide (300 mg/m2/day)/fludarabine (30 mg/m2/day) for 3 days. After a resting period of at least 2 days  GLPG5201 is administered via intravenous infusion. All patients remain hospitalized for at least 7 days and the end-of-study visit is at Week 14 post CAR-T infusion. Phase 1 patient recruitment is ongoing to establish a recommended dose for Phase 2.About chronic lymphocytic leukemia and small cell lymphocytic lymphomaChronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is one of the chronic lymphoproliferative disorders (lymphoid neoplasms). It is characterized by a progressive accumulation of functionally incompetent lymphocytes  which are usually monoclonal in origin. CLL and small cell lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) are essentially the same type of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL)  with the only difference the location where the primary cancer occurs. CLL affects B-cells in the blood and bone marrow and SLL cancer cells are located in lymph nodes and/or the spleen3. RT is an uncommon clinicopathological condition observed in patients with CLL. It is characterized by the sudden transformation of the CLL into a significantly more aggressive form of large cell lymphoma and occurs in approximately 2-10% of all CLL patients. CLL/SLL usually follows an indolent course and is an incurable disease. Patients who develop relapsed and refractory disease and become resistant to new agents have a dismal prognosis and a high unmet medical need for new therapeutic options such as CAR-T cells. With estimated incidence of 4.7 new cases per 100 000 individuals  CLL/SLL are the most prevalent lymphoid malignancies and are the most common adult leukemias in the US and in Europe 4.About GalapagosGalapagos is a fully integrated biotechnology company united around a single purpose: to transform patient outcomes through life-changing science and innovation for more years of life and quality of life.
