(Autopay)Cuvva LimitedRouteOne LLCBy MilesAutoFi  Inc.A subset of financial technology called 'automotive fintech' caters to the need for digital financial services in the auto sector. Digital insurance  car payments  digital leasing  and other services are all part of the automotive fintech industry. Automotive fintech companies streamline and automate financial processes to simplify buying and running automobiles for customers and businesses. These technologies include machine learning  data analytics  and blockchain.Automotive fintech includes equipment for managing and owning vehicles and purchasing and financing them. For instance  smartphone applications let users check their vehicle's health and get alerts when repairs are due. Other systems enable customers to hire automobiles for brief periods without going to a rental car office. These systems provide on-demand automobile sharing and rental services.Most dealerships and car loan financing organizations know that change is necessary and that they must start implementing cutting-edge end-to-end pricing technologies  such as digital loans and purchases. Fortunately  recent developments in cloud and digital technology have made innovations and trends in vehicle finance possible.Auto dealers can now ultimately oversee every element of their lending program due to the sophisticated end-to-end lending software  which integrates cutting-edge technologies like machine learning  advanced data analytics  and artificial intelligence. The usage of such technologies would accelerate market growth.Market Growth FactorsCooperation between cab companies and fintech firmsThe on-demand provision of transportation services to customers through automobiles  taxis  or ride-hailing services is the business of the cab rental industry. With the development of technology and smartphone applications  the industry has seen remarkable growth  making it more straightforward for customers to schedule a trip and track their cars in real-time.Cab companies offer many services  including hourly rentals  point-to-point trips  and airport shuttle services. The collaboration between cab firms and fintech companies for mutual benefits is expected to drive market growth.Automotive industry's digitalizationThe digitization of supply chains is fueled by the continuously growing desire for industries to be more responsible and sustainable globally. Technologies like blockchain and smart contracts will be used to accomplish this objective of traceability and transparency further.The increasing digitalization of the automotive sector provides different growth opportunities for automotive fintech firms to provide better financial services to the consumers and thereby surge market growth.Market Restraining FactorsConcerns regarding security and privacy of the fintech firmsOne-time passwords and other forms of authentication are used by fintech businesses to protect the payment system  but hackers can still access these systems  stealing financial and personal data. While cyberattacks get more sophisticated every day and establishing total security in the digital realm is quite a challenge  financial organizations have always been in danger of data leaks.Yet hackers often use these third-party programs as a point of entry. They allow hackers to pretend to be authorized users to get access without authorization  compromising data security. Data security risk with the fintech firms is anticipated to restrict the market growth.Scope of the StudyBy ChannelOn DemandSubscriptionBy Vehicle TypePassenger CarCommercial VehicleBy Propulsion TypeICEElectricBy End-userDigital Loans & PurchaseOnline LeasingOnline InsuranceIn-Vehicle PaymentsFor more information about this report visit https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/hyiot1About ResearchAndMarkets.comResearchAndMarkets.com is the world's leading source for international market research reports and market data.

The transfer of tokenized assets from Ethereum to another public blockchain will be tested in a third use case.Swift and Ethereum Sepolia networks will be connected using Chainlink as an enterprise abstraction layer  while Chainlink's Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) will enable complete interoperability between the source and destination blockchains.,neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,negative,0.0,0.24,0.76,True,English,"['12 Big Banks', 'Blockchain Testing', 'Chainlink', 'Swift', 'a dozen major financial institutions', 'The Global Financial Messaging Giant', 'Global Financial Messaging Giant Swift', 'New Zealand Banking Group Limited', 'several global blockchain networks', 'same open blockchain network', 'Lloyds Banking Group', 'The Depository Trust', 'SIX Digital Exchange', 'Web3 services platform', 'Three use cases', 'enterprise abstraction layer', 'third use case', 'Ethereum Sepolia networks', 'private blockchain networks', 'existing Swift infrastructure', 'Ethereum Sepolia testnet', 'Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol', 'new set', 'permissioned blockchain', 'blockchain interoperability', 'first case', 'private blockchains', 'public blockchain', 'informational purposes', 'U.Today', 'significant step', 'potential solution', 'significant overhead', 'BNP Paribas', 'BNY Mellon', 'Clearing Corporation', 'tokenized value', 'two wallets', 'destination blockchains', 'complete interoperability', 'tokenized assets', 'investment advice', 'Disclaimer', 'opinion', 'trading', 'risk', 'research', 'decisions', 'money', 'Chainlink', 'experiments', 'connectivity', 'collaboration', 'community', 'connection', 'TphsIU6A3O', 'June', 'quest', 'challenge', 'friction', 'Australia', 'ANZ', 'Citi', 'Clearstream', 'Euroclear', 'SDX', 'DTCC', 'firms', 'transfer', 'range', 'Details', 'CCIP', 'source']",2023-06-06,2023-06-07,u.today

In such a highly fragmented ecosystem  it would simply not be feasible for financial institutions to connect to each and every platform individually. That’s why the community is working with Swift to develop an interoperability model that would enable access to different platforms globally.”Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get crypto email alerts delivered directly to your inboxFollow us on Twitter Facebook and TelegramCheck Latest News HeadlinesDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Election of chairman of the meetingThe board of directors proposes that lawyer Jenny Lindén from Advokatfirman Delphi is elected as chairman of the meeting.Item 7. Resolution regarding a directed issue of shares (issue in kind)BackgroundOn 7 June 2023  the Company entered into an agreement with the shareholders and warrant holders (the ""Sellers"") of BrightBid AB  reg. no. 559250-7957 (""BrightBid"") whereby the Company shall acquire all shares and outstanding warrants in BrightBid.The agreed purchase price for the shares in BrightBid shall be paid by the Sellers subscribing for and being allocated 17 621 411 shares in the Company. The agreement is  among other things  conditional upon the general meeting approving the issue in kind in accordance with the board of directors' proposal. Further information and background to the acquisition of BrightBid can be found in the Company's press release on 7 June 2023.ResolutionIn light of the above  the board of directors proposes that the general meeting resolves on a new share issue against payment in kind on the following terms (the ""Issue in kind""):Share capital and sharesThe Company's share capital may be increased by a maximum of SEK 88 107 061.683108 through a new issue of a maximum of 17 621 411 shares.Right to subscribe for sharesThe right to subscribe for the new shares shall accrue to the Sellers. The new shares will be allocated to the Sellers in proportion to their pro rata share in BrightBid.Contribution in kindPayment for subscribed shares shall be made by contribution in kind consisting of assets in accordance with the board of directors' report on the contribution in kind. Based on the closing price for the Company's share as of 5 June 2023  which amounted to SEK 14.72  the board of directors has calculated the consideration for the contribution in kind to a total of SEK 259 387 169.92. Based on an estimated consideration for the contribution in kind of SEK 259 387 169.92  the subscription price consequently amounts to SEK 14.72. However  the final value at which the contribution in kind will be recognised in the Company's balance sheet will - in accordance with applicable accounting rules - be finally determined based on the share price of the Company's shares at the so-called transaction date and may therefore deviate from the calculated value.Subscription and paymentSubscription of the newly issued shares shall be made on a separate subscription list no later than 3 July 2023. Payment by contribution in kind for the subscribed shares shall be made  in connection with the allocation of the shares  although no later than 3 July 2023.

In such a highly fragmented ecosystem  it would simply not be feasible for financial institutions to connect to each and every platform individually.

25793,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/07/style/samuel-fosso-deutsche-borse-photography-prize-africa-spc/index.html,‘Man of a thousand faces’: Samuel Fosso  known for his iconic self-portraits of famous figures  wins prestigious photography prize,The self-portraits of renowned African photographer Samuel Fosso have earned him this year’s Deutsche Börse Photography Foundation Prize.,"CNN —At first glance  you may think you recognize some of these iconic photographs. The poses  clothing  and framing seem familiar  but look again. These faces aren’t from history books – they are self-portraits of renowned photographer Samuel Fosso  and they have earned him this year’s Deutsche Börse Photography Foundation Prize.Founded by The Photographers’ Gallery in London  the highly coveted prize began in 1996. Every year  a group of more than 100 international photography experts nominate artists for a recent exhibition or published book in Europe from the 12 months preceding. A jury then awards one artist a £30 000 ($37 000) prize for their significant contributions to contemporary photography.For Fosso  60  it was his exhibition at Paris’ Maison Européenne de la Photographie in 2022 that placed him in the running. “It was the first time there was a retrospective (exhibition) of all my work. All my artistic work was shown. All my self-portraits were present ” he said.Known as “the man with a thousand faces ” Fosso has been artistically borrowing identities for over 40 years. From challenging social archetypes with an imagined Black pope to embodying historical figures such as Martin Luther King  Jr.  it is this performative self-portraiture that caught the jury’s attention.“Even though his technique is quite simple  and straightforward  and traditional in many senses  it’s really powerful and impactful ” said Shoair Mavlian  director of The Photographers’ Gallery and voting chair for this year’s prize. “His work goes beyond photography and really talks about history and global politics. He’s been interrogating these things for a really long time.”In his series titled ""70s Lifestyle "" Samuel Fosso mimics the style of popular Cameroonian Nigerian musician Prince Nico Mbarga in this self-portrait. Samuel Fosso/Courtesy JM Patras  ParisFrom humble beginnings to international recognitionFosso’s self-portraits can be traced back to when he was a teenager. Born in Cameroon  he moved to Nigeria but fled the country as a young boy after the Nigerian-Biafra civil war in 1972  ending up with an uncle in the Central African Republic.Three years later  at age 13  he began taking photographs for a variety of commercial work  from weddings to graduations  and even portraits of newborn babies.At the end of the day  with some of his leftover film in the camera  Fosso would dress up and take photos of himself.“I wanted my (future) children to know how I was when I was a young man ” he said. “And I also sent these photos of myself to my grandmother who was in Nigeria. I was really close to her and wanted to show her how I was evolving.”Over the years  this practice became explorative. From highlighting African American fashion in his first collection of photographs called “70’s Lifestyle ” to examining oppression and colonization in the 1997 series “Tati ” much of Fosso’s work explores identity politics – garnering worldwide attention.Embodying “African Spirits”Though he says he likes all his series  Fosso confessed a special love for “African Spirits.”In 2008  he dressed up as 14 prominent Black historical figures – from Ghana’s first president Kwame Nkrumah and Malcolm X  to Muhammad Ali and Angela Davis. He studied their photos to mimic their demeanor  their fashion choices  and their poses before impersonating them in front of the camera in his studio.Samuel Fosso strikes the iconic pose of Olympian Tommie Smith in this photograph from the 2008 series ""African Spirits."" Samuel Fosso/Courtesy JM Patras  Paris“It’s never evident  what Black people suffered for independence or during slavery ” said Fosso. “The new generation must know how these people were for us  and what they did for us and even that they were murdered for Black freedom. That is the aim.”Having exhibited at the Guggenheim in New York  the Fondation Louis Vuitton in Paris  the Tate Modern in London and more  Fosso is no stranger to the limelight.

In a world where AI generated music is quickly taking off  Deezer expands its commitment to help artists monetize their music better  fight fraud  and create a better user experience for fans.""With over 100 000 new tracks uploaded per day to our platform  it's becoming increasingly important to prioritize quality over quantity and defend real artists that create truly valuable content "" said Jeronimo  CEO of Deezer. ""As a leading streaming platform  Deezer has a responsibility to create a fair and transparent environment for music consumption. Our goal is to weed out illegal and fraudulent content  increase transparency  and develop a new remuneration system where professional artists are rewarded for creating valuable content. This is why we have embraced the discussion around a new artist centric model  and we are now also developing tools to detect AI-generated content.""By detecting AI generated content on its platform  Deezer aims to develop a system for tagging music that has been created by generative AI  starting with songs using synthetic voices of existing artists. The tags will be used to keep artists  labels  and users informed of what's ""real"" or AI-generated on the platform  reduce fraudulent activity  and ultimately develop a remuneration model that distinguishes between different types of music creation.Jeronimo continues: ""AI can be used to create new incredible content and I believe there are massive benefits of using generative AI  but we need to ensure it's done in a responsible way. There's an opportunity now to get things right from the start of the AI revolution  and not make the same mistakes as the social media giants did when fake news started to flood their platforms. We owe it to the artists and the fans.""Deezer's toolset will leverage years of research on Audio AI and content identification  starting with the company's proprietary ""Radar"" technology.

So argues Kevin Wilzbach  Director  Technology Product Management  at Wolters Kluwer Compliance Solutions. These insights on trends in the lending landscape and what lenders should be focusing on regarding digital lending appear in a recently published MBA Newslinks feature  “Rethinking digital lending in a down market: Focus on what you need and then start where you can.”“What we’re seeing in the marketplace is that early adopters of digital lending are for the most part staying committed to eClosings and eNote creation ” writes Wilzbach. “In fact  in a recent survey of mortgage banks  nearly a third of the respondents said that the sharp decline in overall originations increased [their] organization’s progress in implementing digital initiatives.”“Multiple industry surveys  including one commissioned by Wolters Kluwer that was conducted among independent mortgage banks in March 2023  found that lenders of all sizes recognize the benefits of being more digital ” says Wilzbach. “Participants in the survey cited improved operational efficiency  more modern customer experience  and a reduction in loan defects in closing documents due to signing and notarization issues as the top reasons that digital lending is the future.”Wilzbach adds that it doesn’t have to be all or nothing. Digitization can be a “journey.” There are discrete phases of digital lending that are far less expensive than big-ticket investments (like a loan origination system) and that can be implemented relatively quickly.“A lender’s entire digital lending strategy doesn’t have to be fully in place to get started. A launch can occur with the completion of an incremental deliverable. Success can come in large part from ‘chunking’ various parts of the process into smaller  more digestible parts. Hybrid  for example  versus full digital or IPEN (in-person electronic notarizations) versus RON (Remote Online Notarization) ” he concludes.Wolters Kluwer Compliance Solutions is a market leader and trusted provider of risk management and regulatory compliance solutions and services to U.S. banks  credit unions  insurers and securities firms.

Based on Kalray's patented MPPA® (Massively Parallel Processor Array) architecture  the Coolidge™2 processor has been designed to deliver ever-higher performance in the processing of artificial intelligence (AI) and data in general. Thanks to Coolidge™2  Kalray intends to accelerate its growth  particularly in edge computing and data- intensive storage workloads.COOLIDGE™2  AN ULTRA-HIGH PERFORMANCE DPU PROCESSOR FOR AIAt a time when AI development is progressing rapidly  mastering this technology is a major challenge  both in terms of managing algorithms and in processing the massive quantities of data generated and stored by AI workloads. Processors are at the forefront of the solution.“We are very excited to announce the tape-out of Coolidge™2  in line with our roadmap. This is an essential milestone  marking the start of the manufacturing process and the culmination of a technological challenge. Coolidge™2 will enable us to offer enterprises an extremely competitive alternative for data processing and AI in particular  with one of the best ratios for performance/energy consumption/price in the inference and edge computing markets “  says Eric Baissus  CEO of Kalray.In this race to performance  Kalray's Coolidge™2 DPU processor stands out for its MPPA® architecture  which offers unique capabilities and enables fine control over neural network processing  from memory transfers to utilization of the processor's computing capabilities. Kalray has optimized every element to enhance the processor's overall performance  demonstrating the effectiveness of the Coolidge™2 processor architecture.As a result  Coolidge™2 will offer up to 10 times the performance as compared to the previous version of the processor. This improvement will be relevant for applications such as deep learning algorithms used in neural networks applied to image processing.At the end of 2022  Kalray announced the signing of a ""jumbo contract[2]"" with a major player  who intends to integrate Coolidge™2 into its forthcoming solutions.SOLUTIONS FOR DATA-INTENSIVE STORAGEWith the rise of AI and the need to process and analyze data ever more efficiently  fast storage plays an essential role. Large language model solutions such as ChatGPT could not function without a fast  efficient storage system that enables predictive models to be trained as quickly as possible.Thanks to its DPU processor  Kalray enjoys a unique position in the data-intensive storage market. Coolidge™2 is specifically optimized to complement Kalray's current range of NVMe storage solutions and to deliver the performance required to meet market demands for years to come.“Data-intensive storage is a fast-growing market  particularly due to the adoption of increasingly large predictive AI models that are very greedy for storage resources during the learning phases. Coolidge™2 offers our customers a unique solution to accelerate the learning phase of models  which is a major challenge for the industry ” concludes Eric Baissus.Finally  Coolidge™2 will provide all the technical assets of its predecessor: computing power combined with low energy consumption  ease of programming  high-speed interfaces  the ability to run multiple applications in parallel and deterministically  and on-the-fly  real-time data processing.

All three Group divisions showed a healthy growth for the second year running: Sports 22.0%  Sportainment & Climbing 8.4%  Changing Rooms 12.4%.Operating performance maintained despite a highly inflationary environmentDriven by the recovery in business and tight control of operating expenses  2022/23 recurring EBITDA amounted to €27.5m[2]  up 4.1%. The recurring EBITDA margin amounted to 11.5% of revenue  down 1.3 percentage point versus 2021/22 amid an inflationary environment and a challenging recruitment market.This change includes:a limited 0.7 percentage point decline in the gross margin to 60.4% achieved through the policy of passing raw material price increases on to selling tight control of operating expenses[3] (up 15%)  down 0.6 percentage point in proportion of revenue (51.7% versus 52.3% in FY 2021/22).Compared to the 2019/20 pre-crisis financial year  the Group recurring EBITDA margin improved by 2.1 percentage points  thereby confirming the continuous effects of the performance plan.The Sports division declared a recurring EBITDA of €17.1m equivalent to 13.8% of division total revenues  showing 1.6 percentage point of margin erosion versus prior year  mainly due to inflation during the first half of 2022/23  which tailed off in the second half (recurring EBITDA margin of 15% of revenue).The Sportainment & Climbing division reported a recurring EBITDA of €1.6m with a margin level at 3.3%  down 0.5 percentage point versus prior year. The tight control of fixed costs enabled the division to confirm a good operational resilience despite a more competitive environment in the second half and market conditions still below pre-covid levels.The Changing Rooms division delivered a recurring EBITDA of €8.8m showing an EBITDA margin rate at 13.3%  down 2.1 percentage points versus prior year mainly impacted by inflation  while maintaining an optimised cost structure.After depreciation of fixed assets (€12.2m  including €5.6m related to IFRS 16)  the recurring operating income amounted to €15.2m  up 0.5% and representing 6.4% of revenue.Finally  operating income amounted to €14.6m in 2022/23  up 3.0% compared to prior year. Net income Group share showed a slight decrease from €7.2m last year to €6.7m this year  mainly impacted by unfavourable foreign exchange trend (€1.1m loss versus a gain of €0.6m in 2021/22).Sound financial structure2022/23 cash flow from operations before change effect in working capital and tax amounted to a €27.2m.

This performance was driven by a strong dynamic of activity in all sectors. Aerospace-Space-Defence posted further growth of almost 20% over the year as a whole  and now accounts for 21.1% of the SII Group's total sales. The Banking sector grew by 17.1%. All the other sectors  with the exception of telecoms  are also posting double-digit growth rates.In France  the revenue reached € 434.1m in rise of 13.2%.

The group has continued and extended its Great Place To Work labelling programme.Further improved profitabilityAt the end of March 2023  the group’s profitability improved in France and internationally.Operating profit from ordinary activities exceeded €100m for the first time  at €102.8m. This performance is explained by the continuing positive effects of the SII Group's reorganisation  a further improvement in the AREH1 which reached its optimum at 89.9% across all activities  and the efforts of each subsidiary to contribute to this improvement. Overall  the operating margin reached an all-time high of 9.8%. In France  the operating margin improved slightly to 7.17% (7.03% in the previous fiscal year). The international operating margin was 11.82%  compared to 11.69% at the end of March 2022.After taking into account the financial result and taxes  the net result amounts to €80.5m  which represents a net margin of 7.87%.At March 31  2023  the balance sheet showed a net cash position (excluding IFRS16) of €163.9m  compared with €128.6m at the end of March 2022.

On 25 May  the SII Group finalised the acquisition of RESA-IT  which employs just over 50 people. Thanks to this acquisition  the SII Group’s Dutch subsidiary has extended its expertise to the fields of IT and is expanding its offerings in a growing market. The combined entity is expected to generate sales exceeding €10 million in the 2023-2024 fiscal year. The activities of RESA-IT will be consolidated in the books of Group SII as of June 1  2023.Proposed dividend of €0.50 per shareIn keeping with its dividend distribution policy  the SII Group will propose  at the General Meeting of Shareholders to be held on September 21  2023  the payment of a dividend of €0.50 per share.Outlook 2023-2024The SII Group is growing in the digital sector  which still seems promising. The SII Group can also count on its solid advantages  especially its organisation  its sectoral and geographical diversity and its quality HR policy.However  in addition to the initial uncertainties associated with labour shortages  inflationary pressures and geopolitical questions  there are now issues related to monetary policies and their macroeconomic impacts  whose effects on the future level of activity are difficult to predict.In this unpredictable context  the SII Group anticipates organic sales growth of between 8% and 12% for the first half of its 2023-2024 fiscal year. The SII Group also aims to maintain its operating margin between 9% and 10% during this first half-year. The SII Group will specify its objectives for the financial year at the time its half-yearly results are published  depending on economic developments.***Next financial announcement:Fiscal 2023-2024 first quarter revenue  Wednesday  August 10  2023 after closing market-Contacts:SII - Eric Matteucci: +33(0) 142 848 222Press: Séverine BATY - +33(0) 664 157 024-Receive all of our communication by subscribing on our website: www.sii-group.comEuronext Paris Compartment BLEI: 96950044FWV7YEJCKR65About SIIFounded in 1979 by qualified engineer Bernard Huvé  the SII Group’s activity is balanced between engineering and technology consulting (ETC) and digital services (DSC).The SII Group provides employment for more than 16 000 people  structured in a way that offers all the responsiveness and flexibility of a local service.
