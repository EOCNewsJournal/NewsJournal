The data presented support the preliminary safety and efficacy of UCART22 in a heavily pretreated relapsed/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (r/r B-ALL) population.“These clinical data are very positive for patients with r/r B-ALL who have failed multiple lines of treatment options including chemotherapy  CD19 directed CAR T-cell therapy and allogeneic stem cell transplant and encourage further enrollment into the BALLI-01 clinical study” said Nicolas Boissel  M.D.  Ph.D.  Head of Hematology Adolescent and Young Adult Unit at Hôpital Saint-Louis  Paris  France.The poster presentation at EHA highlights the following data:BALLI-01 is a Phase 1/2a open-label study  evaluating the safety and clinical activity of UCART22 in patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (r/r B-ALL).The poster presentation reviewed clinical and translational data from patients who received UCART22 after lymphodepletion (LD) with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (FC) (F : 30 mg/m2 × 3d  C : 1.0 g/m2 × 3d) or fludarabine  cyclophosphamide and alemtuzumab (FCA) (F: 30 mg/m2 × 3d  C : 0.5g/m2 × 3d  A : 20 mg/d × 3d) in patients with r/r B-ALL.Compared to the clinical update on BALLI-01 at ASH 2021  the poster presents data from six additional patients who received UCART22 at dose level 3 (DL3)  5 x 106 cells/kg  as of the December 31  2022 data cutoff.Preliminary safety dataUCART22 administered after FC or FCA LD regimen was well tolerated. No dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) nor immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) were observed; 61% of patients reported cytokine release syndrome (CRS) (Grade 1 [N=9] or Grade 2 [N=2]). One serious adverse event of special interest (AESI) of Grade 2 graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) (skin) was reported in the setting of reactivation of prior allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) donor stem cells. Serious adverse events (SAEs) (G≥3) reported in 72% of patients included infections (39%) and febrile neutropenia (28%)  and all were not related to UCART22.Preliminary efficacy dataResponses were assessed beginning on Day 28.Up to FC/FCA-Intermediate Dose Level 2 (DL2i): 3 complete remissions with incomplete count recovery (CRi) and 1 morphologic leukemia-free state (MLFS) were observed and previously reported at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) 2021 conference.For FCA-Dose Level 3 (DL3)  50% of the six patients responded:1 patient who failed 4 prior lines  including multiagent chemotherapy  blinatumomab  inotuzumab  autologous CAR19  and allogeneic HSCT  achieved a minimal residual disease (MRD) negative complete response (CR) lasting over 90 days after UCART22 infusion as of the December 31  2022 data cutoff.1 patient who failed 4 prior lines  including multiagent chemotherapy  venetoclax  autologous CAR19  and allogeneic HSCT  achieved an MRD negative complete response with incomplete count recovery (CRi) consolidated with donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) after Day 90 and remains in an MRD negative CRi past 7 months as of the December 31  2022 data cutoff.1 patient who failed 3 prior lines  including multiagent chemotherapy  venetoclax  autologous CAR19  and allogeneic HSCT  achieved an MRD negative MLFS up to Day 114.Host lymphocytes remained suppressed (mean ALC <0.1 x103 cells/mL) through Day 28 for all patients who received FCA LD. Peak ferritin levels correlated with UCART22 cell expansion and cytokine release syndrome (CRS). UCART22 continues to be safe and tolerable  with no treatment emergent serious adverse events (TEAEs) or DLTs reported. UCART22 cell expansion was detected in 9 of 13 patients in the FCA LD arm and associated with clinical activity.Overall  these data support the preliminary safety and efficacy of UCART22 in this heavily pretreated r/r B-ALL population.The BALLI-01 study is currently enrolling patients after FCA lymphodepletion. UCART22 is currently the most advanced allogeneic CAR T-cell product in development for r/r B-ALL. The next data set is expected to be released later this year.The poster presentation is available on Cellectis’ website: https://www.cellectis.com/en/investors/scientific-presentations/About CellectisCellectis is a clinical-stage biotechnology company using its pioneering gene-editing platform to develop life-saving cell and gene therapies.

The data presented support the preliminary safety and efficacy of UCART22 in a heavily pretreated relapsed/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (r/r B-ALL) population.“These clinical data are very positive for patients with r/r B-ALL who have failed multiple lines of treatment options including chemotherapy  CD19 directed CAR T-cell therapy and allogeneic stem cell transplant and encourage further enrollment into the BALLI-01 clinical study” said Nicolas Boissel  M.D.  Ph.D.  Head of Hematology Adolescent and Young Adult Unit at Hôpital Saint-Louis  Paris  France.The poster presentation at EHA highlights the following data:BALLI-01 is a Phase 1/2a open-label study  evaluating the safety and clinical activity of UCART22 in patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (r/r B-ALL).The poster presentation reviewed clinical and translational data from patients who received UCART22 after lymphodepletion (LD) with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (FC) (F : 30 mg/m2 × 3d  C : 1.0 g/m2 × 3d) or fludarabine  cyclophosphamide and alemtuzumab (FCA) (F: 30 mg/m2 × 3d  C : 0.5g/m2 × 3d  A : 20 mg/d × 3d) in patients with r/r B-ALL.Compared to the clinical update on BALLI-01 at ASH 2021  the poster presents data from six additional patients who received UCART22 at dose level 3 (DL3)  5 x 106 cells/kg  as of the December 31  2022 data cutoff.Preliminary safety dataUCART22 administered after FC or FCA LD regimen was well tolerated. No dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) nor immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) were observed; 61% of patients reported cytokine release syndrome (CRS) (Grade 1 [N=9] or Grade 2 [N=2]). One serious adverse event of special interest (AESI) of Grade 2 graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) (skin) was reported in the setting of reactivation of prior allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) donor stem cells. Serious adverse events (SAEs) (G≥3) reported in 72% of patients included infections (39%) and febrile neutropenia (28%)  and all were not related to UCART22.Preliminary efficacy dataResponses were assessed beginning on Day 28.Up to FC/FCA-Intermediate Dose Level 2 (DL2i): 3 complete remissions with incomplete count recovery (CRi) and 1 morphologic leukemia-free state (MLFS) were observed and previously reported at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) 2021 conference.For FCA-Dose Level 3 (DL3)  50% of the six patients responded:1 patient who failed 4 prior lines  including multiagent chemotherapy  blinatumomab  inotuzumab  autologous CAR19  and allogeneic HSCT  achieved a minimal residual disease (MRD) negative complete response (CR) lasting over 90 days after UCART22 infusion as of the December 31  2022 data cutoff.1 patient who failed 4 prior lines  including multiagent chemotherapy  venetoclax  autologous CAR19  and allogeneic HSCT  achieved an MRD negative complete response with incomplete count recovery (CRi) consolidated with donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) after Day 90 and remains in an MRD negative CRi past 7 months as of the December 31  2022 data cutoff.1 patient who failed 3 prior lines  including multiagent chemotherapy  venetoclax  autologous CAR19  and allogeneic HSCT  achieved an MRD negative MLFS up to Day 114.Host lymphocytes remained suppressed (mean ALC <0.1 x103 cells/mL) through Day 28 for all patients who received FCA LD. Peak ferritin levels correlated with UCART22 cell expansion and cytokine release syndrome (CRS). UCART22 continues to be safe and tolerable  with no treatment emergent serious adverse events (TEAEs) or DLTs reported. UCART22 cell expansion was detected in 9 of 13 patients in the FCA LD arm and associated with clinical activity.Overall  these data support the preliminary safety and efficacy of UCART22 in this heavily pretreated r/r B-ALL population.The BALLI-01 study is currently enrolling patients after FCA lymphodepletion. UCART22 is currently the most advanced allogeneic CAR T-cell product in development for r/r B-ALL. The next data set is expected to be released later this year.The poster presentation is available on Cellectis’ website: https://www.cellectis.com/en/investors/scientific-presentations/About CellectisCellectis is a clinical-stage biotechnology company using its pioneering gene-editing platform to develop life-saving cell and gene therapies.

The contract covers the development and supply of a compressor as part of a project to develop and test an exhaust gas sequestration system for ship engines. ENOGIA has been selected by STX Engine as a partner in a consortium that also includes Hyundai Materials  the Institute of Advanced Engineering and other Korean players. The company will be responsible for developing the compressor that will be integrated into the future CO2 capture system. ENOGIA's technology perfectly aligned with the challenges of carbon dioxide sequestration Arthur Leroux  ENOGIA CEO  says: « We are very pleased with this agreement  which opens up excellent development prospects for our company in the field of carbon dioxide sequestration. Our skills and tools enable us to develop tailor-made compression solutions in a very short timeframe. The fact that a Korean consortium  winner of a highly competitive call for projects  chose us as a partner demonstrates that our expertise in turbomachinery development is recognized worldwide. Today  ENOGIA is in a position to simultaneously produce ORC modules for the decarbonization of industry and develop innovative turbomachinery for ecological transition projects. » Decarbonizing the maritime sector  which is responsible for over 800 million tonnes of CO2-equivalent greenhouse gas emissions worldwide[1]  is at the heart of today's environmental challenges. In this context  carbon capture technology appears to be an attractive alternative for decarbonizing ship propulsion systems  where battery electrification seems unrealistic and hydrogen storage difficult. A successful project with STX Engine would open the door to a vast market for ENOGIA  based on a fleet of some 100 000 passenger and freight vessels worldwide[2] The maritime transport sector also represents a priority target market for ENOGIA through its ORC modules. These modules convert waste heat from propulsion systems into clean electricity  reducing fuel consumption for auxiliary power units. ENOGIA's ORC technology stands out for its ability to make the most of low-temperature waste heat  a decisive advantage in maritime transport  where engine waste heat is generally low-temperature.

We’ve made it possible to evolve design from drawings to 3D master models. We’ve replaced expensive physical mockups by collaborative digital mockups  thus paving the way to collaborative platforms. Inventing Product Lifecycle Management industry solutions  we created digital continuity between design  production and supply. We catalyzed the global shift from a product economy to the Experience economy with the introduction of 3DEXPERIENCE. Extending the power of virtual twin experiences from things to life  we enabled precision medicine for the benefit of all patients.In driving these major transformations  we’ve established long-term relationships with a very loyal global customer base  whose leaders pioneer the way to virtualization for their entire industry.In fact  we are just getting started; this heritage we built is a strong lever for our future growth. As we look to our next horizon  2040  we believe fostering the connection between the Experience economy and the sustainable economy requires going far beyond a transformation. A true metamorphosis is needed that can be achieved by learning from life.We have laid a strong foundation for realizing this vision by evolving our leadership and governance. We measure the distance travelled during the past four decades  developing Dassault Systèmes from a startup to a global player  and transforming many industries  from Aerospace to the future of mobility and now Life Sciences & Healthcare practices. Our journey together has been an incredibly enjoyable time and we are ready to write the next chapter of the Company’s history by completing our governance transformation. Building on the tandem approach which proved successful with Charles Edelstenne  I will continue as Chairman to collaborate closely with the Company’s new CEO  Pascal Daloz  so that we can keep building Dassault Systèmes’ legacy and fulfill its purpose to provide businesses and people with 3DEXPERIENCE universes to imagine sustainable innovations capable of harmonizing product  nature and life.”Pascal Daloz  Dassault Systèmes’ Deputy Chief Executive Officer & Chief Operating Officer  commented:“Looking to our next horizon  2040  virtual twin experiences will be a catalyst for new ways of collaborating at scale  capitalizing knowledge and know-how based on “Experience as a Service”. Sustainability will be paramount  furthering the adoption of our next generation PLM. With the combination of modelling and simulation and AI  innovation will accelerate at an exponential pace. These secular trends will have a profound impact on industry and society. As a scientific company  we are uniquely well-positioned to expand the world of virtual twin experiences so that customers can make the industry of the 21st century sustainable.Dassault Systèmes started with applications  transformed into a platform company  and will begin its next chapter as the Virtual Twin Experience Company  providing “Experience as a Service”. As we enable the complete metamorphosis of the economy  our clients’ business models and our own business model  we will expand our value propositions  and audiences – reaching consumers  patients and citizens. Dassault Systèmes will increase its addressable markets from €100 billion today to €1 trillion by 2040.Looking to the future  our purpose – to harmonize product nature and life – will continue to guide the creation of human-centered industry solutions. We are uniquely positioned to be the catalyst and enabler of a more sustainable industry and society. I could not be more excited about the future and what we can achieve together.”Rouven Bergmann  Dassault Systèmes’ Chief Financial Officer  commented:“Dassault Systèmes' strong business model and balance sheet positions us well to leverage the considerable opportunities across our large  addressable end-markets  driving sustainable  double-digit  revenue growth  well into the future. We will continue to invest  enhancing the strong fundamentals of our business  driven by an increasing share of predictable revenue and an accelerating 3DEXPERIENCE and Cloud adoption.We are confident in our ability to build on our track record of consistent execution and financial performance  increasing profitability and reaching our long-term non-IFRS EPS objective of €2.20 - €2.40 in 2028. Our high cash conversion rate and disciplined capital allocation strategy create ample financial flexibility to advance our strategic priorities through organic growth as well as acquisitions.”Investor Relations EventsSecond Quarter 2023 Earnings Release: July 25  2023Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Release: October 25  2023Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Release: February 1  2024Forward-looking InformationStatements herein that are not historical facts but express expectations or objectives for the future  including but not limited to statements regarding the Group’s non-IFRS financial performance objectives are forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are based on Dassault Systèmes management's current views and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Actual results or performances may differ materially from those in such statements due to a range of factors.The Group’s actual results or performance may be materially negatively affected by numerous risks and uncertainties  as described in the “Risk Factors” section 1.9 of the 2022 Universal Registration Document (‘Document d'enregistrement universel’) filed with the AMF (French Financial Markets Authority) on March 17  2023  available on the Group’s website www.3ds.com.In particular  please refer to the risk factor “Uncertain Global Economic Environment” in section 1.9.1.1 of the 2022 Universal Registration Document set out below for ease of reference:“In light of the uncertainties regarding economic  business  social  health and geopolitical conditions at the global level  Dassault Systèmes’ revenue  net earnings and cash flows may grow more slowly  whether on an annual or quarterly basis  mainly due to the following factors:the deployment of Dassault Systèmes’ solutions may represent a large portion of a customer’s investments in software technology. Decisions to make such an investment are impacted by the economic environment in which the customers operate. Uncertain global geopolitical  economic and health conditions and the lack of visibility or the lack of financial resources may cause some customers  e.g. within automotive  aerospace  energy or natural resources industries  to reduce  postpone or terminate their investments  or to reduce or not renew ongoing paid maintenance for their installed base  which impact larger customers’ revenue with their respective sub contractors;the political  economic and monetary situation in certain geographic regions where Dassault Systèmes operates could become more volatile and impact Dassault Systèmes’ business  for example  due to stricter export compliance rules or the introduction of new customs tariffs;continued pressure or volatility on raw materials and energy prices could also slow down Dassault Systèmes’ diversification efforts in new industries;uncertainties regarding the extent and duration of inflation could adversely affect the financial position of Dassault Systèmes; andthe sales cycle of the Dassault Systèmes’ products – already relatively long due to the strategic nature of such investments for customers – could further lengthen.The occurrence of crises – health and geopolitical crises in particular – could have consequences both for the health and safety of Dassault Systèmes’ employees and for the Company. It could also adversely impact the financial situation or financing and supply capabilities of Dassault Systèmes’ existing and potential customers  commercial and technology partners  some of whom may be forced to temporarily close sites or cease operations. A deteriorating economic environment could generate increased price pressure and affect the collection of receivables  which would negatively impact Dassault Systèmes’ revenue  financial performance and market position.Dassault Systèmes makes every effort to take into consideration this uncertain macroeconomic outlook. Dassault Systèmes’ business results  however  may not develop as anticipated. Furthermore  due to factors affecting sales of Dassault Systèmes’ products and services  there may be a substantial time lag between an improvement in global economic and business conditions and an upswing in the Company’s business results.”In preparing such forward-looking statements  the Group has in particular assumed an average US dollar to euro exchange rate of US$1.10 per €1.00 as well as an average Japanese yen to euro exchange rate of JPY140.0 to €1.00  before hedging for the second quarter 2023. The Group has in particular assumed an average US dollar to euro exchange rate of US$1.09 per €1.00 as well as an average Japanese yen to euro exchange rate of JPY140.5 to €1.00  before hedging for the full year 2023. However  currency values fluctuate  and the Group’s results may be significantly affected by changes in exchange rates.Non-IFRS Financial InformationReaders are cautioned that the supplemental non-IFRS financial information presented in this press release is subject to inherent limitations.

We’ve made it possible to evolve design from drawings to 3D master models. We’ve replaced expensive physical mockups by collaborative digital mockups  thus paving the way to collaborative platforms. Inventing Product Lifecycle Management industry solutions  we created digital continuity between design  production and supply. We catalyzed the global shift from a product economy to the Experience economy with the introduction of 3DEXPERIENCE. Extending the power of virtual twin experiences from things to life  we enabled precision medicine for the benefit of all patients.In driving these major transformations  we’ve established long-term relationships with a very loyal global customer base  whose leaders pioneer the way to virtualization for their entire industry.In fact  we are just getting started; this heritage we built is a strong lever for our future growth. As we look to our next horizon  2040  we believe fostering the connection between the Experience economy and the sustainable economy requires going far beyond a transformation. A true metamorphosis is needed that can be achieved by learning from life.We have laid a strong foundation for realizing this vision by evolving our leadership and governance. We measure the distance travelled during the past four decades  developing Dassault Systèmes from a startup to a global player  and transforming many industries  from Aerospace to the future of mobility and now Life Sciences & Healthcare practices. Our journey together has been an incredibly enjoyable time and we are ready to write the next chapter of the Company’s history by completing our governance transformation. Building on the tandem approach which proved successful with Charles Edelstenne  I will continue as Chairman to collaborate closely with the Company’s new CEO  Pascal Daloz  so that we can keep building Dassault Systèmes’ legacy and fulfill its purpose to provide businesses and people with 3DEXPERIENCE universes to imagine sustainable innovations capable of harmonizing product  nature and life.”Pascal Daloz  Dassault Systèmes’ Deputy Chief Executive Officer & Chief Operating Officer  commented:“Looking to our next horizon  2040  virtual twin experiences will be a catalyst for new ways of collaborating at scale  capitalizing knowledge and know-how based on “Experience as a Service”. Sustainability will be paramount  furthering the adoption of our next generation PLM. With the combination of modelling and simulation and AI  innovation will accelerate at an exponential pace. These secular trends will have a profound impact on industry and society. As a scientific company  we are uniquely well-positioned to expand the world of virtual twin experiences so that customers can make the industry of the 21st century sustainable.Dassault Systèmes started with applications  transformed into a platform company  and will begin its next chapter as the Virtual Twin Experience Company  providing “Experience as a Service”. As we enable the complete metamorphosis of the economy  our clients’ business models and our own business model  we will expand our value propositions  and audiences – reaching consumers  patients and citizens. Dassault Systèmes will increase its addressable markets from €100 billion today to €1 trillion by 2040.Looking to the future  our purpose – to harmonize product nature and life – will continue to guide the creation of human-centered industry solutions. We are uniquely positioned to be the catalyst and enabler of a more sustainable industry and society. I could not be more excited about the future and what we can achieve together.”Rouven Bergmann  Dassault Systèmes’ Chief Financial Officer  commented:“Dassault Systèmes' strong business model and balance sheet positions us well to leverage the considerable opportunities across our large  addressable end-markets  driving sustainable  double-digit  revenue growth  well into the future. We will continue to invest  enhancing the strong fundamentals of our business  driven by an increasing share of predictable revenue and an accelerating 3DEXPERIENCE and Cloud adoption.We are confident in our ability to build on our track record of consistent execution and financial performance  increasing profitability and reaching our long-term non-IFRS EPS objective of €2.20 - €2.40 in 2028. Our high cash conversion rate and disciplined capital allocation strategy create ample financial flexibility to advance our strategic priorities through organic growth as well as acquisitions.”Investor Relations EventsSecond Quarter 2023 Earnings Release: July 25  2023Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Release: October 25  2023Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Release: February 1  2024Forward-looking InformationStatements herein that are not historical facts but express expectations or objectives for the future  including but not limited to statements regarding the Group’s non-IFRS financial performance objectives are forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are based on Dassault Systèmes management's current views and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Actual results or performances may differ materially from those in such statements due to a range of factors.The Group’s actual results or performance may be materially negatively affected by numerous risks and uncertainties  as described in the “Risk Factors” section 1.9 of the 2022 Universal Registration Document (‘Document d'enregistrement universel’) filed with the AMF (French Financial Markets Authority) on March 17  2023  available on the Group’s website www.3ds.com.In particular  please refer to the risk factor “Uncertain Global Economic Environment” in section 1.9.1.1 of the 2022 Universal Registration Document set out below for ease of reference:“In light of the uncertainties regarding economic  business  social  health and geopolitical conditions at the global level  Dassault Systèmes’ revenue  net earnings and cash flows may grow more slowly  whether on an annual or quarterly basis  mainly due to the following factors:the deployment of Dassault Systèmes’ solutions may represent a large portion of a customer’s investments in software technology. Decisions to make such an investment are impacted by the economic environment in which the customers operate. Uncertain global geopolitical  economic and health conditions and the lack of visibility or the lack of financial resources may cause some customers  e.g. within automotive  aerospace  energy or natural resources industries  to reduce  postpone or terminate their investments  or to reduce or not renew ongoing paid maintenance for their installed base  which impact larger customers’ revenue with their respective sub contractors;the political  economic and monetary situation in certain geographic regions where Dassault Systèmes operates could become more volatile and impact Dassault Systèmes’ business  for example  due to stricter export compliance rules or the introduction of new customs tariffs;continued pressure or volatility on raw materials and energy prices could also slow down Dassault Systèmes’ diversification efforts in new industries;uncertainties regarding the extent and duration of inflation could adversely affect the financial position of Dassault Systèmes; andthe sales cycle of the Dassault Systèmes’ products – already relatively long due to the strategic nature of such investments for customers – could further lengthen.The occurrence of crises – health and geopolitical crises in particular – could have consequences both for the health and safety of Dassault Systèmes’ employees and for the Company. It could also adversely impact the financial situation or financing and supply capabilities of Dassault Systèmes’ existing and potential customers  commercial and technology partners  some of whom may be forced to temporarily close sites or cease operations. A deteriorating economic environment could generate increased price pressure and affect the collection of receivables  which would negatively impact Dassault Systèmes’ revenue  financial performance and market position.Dassault Systèmes makes every effort to take into consideration this uncertain macroeconomic outlook. Dassault Systèmes’ business results  however  may not develop as anticipated. Furthermore  due to factors affecting sales of Dassault Systèmes’ products and services  there may be a substantial time lag between an improvement in global economic and business conditions and an upswing in the Company’s business results.”In preparing such forward-looking statements  the Group has in particular assumed an average US dollar to euro exchange rate of US$1.10 per €1.00 as well as an average Japanese yen to euro exchange rate of JPY140.0 to €1.00  before hedging for the second quarter 2023. The Group has in particular assumed an average US dollar to euro exchange rate of US$1.09 per €1.00 as well as an average Japanese yen to euro exchange rate of JPY140.5 to €1.00  before hedging for the full year 2023. However  currency values fluctuate  and the Group’s results may be significantly affected by changes in exchange rates.Non-IFRS Financial InformationReaders are cautioned that the supplemental non-IFRS financial information presented in this press release is subject to inherent limitations.

IPH6501 is a first-in-class CD20-targeting tetra-specific ANKET® that co-engages two activating receptors (NKp46 and CD16)  the interleukin-2 receptor (without involvement of the IL-2Rα subunit) with a human IL-2 variant and CD20 target antigen on malignant B cells.In preclinical settings  IPH6501 was shown to induce NK cell proliferation and to trigger high NK cell cytoxicity against CD20+ target cells in in vitro assays  in ex vivo assays with relapse/refractory (R/R) B-NHL patient samples who received at least one prior treatment  as well as in in vivo studies in non-human primates. A surrogate of IPH6501 mediated a potent anti-tumor activity in vivo in CD20+ tumor models in mice. In addition  in ex vivo assays with R/R B-NHL patient samples  IPH6501 was shown to be more efficient than a T cell engager targeting CD20.Pr. Eric Vivier  PhD  DVM  Chief Scientific Officer at Innate Pharma ""As the lead in this new class of tetra-specific NK-cell engager  IPH6501 represents an innovative option for the treatment of R/R B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas after multiple lines of treatment  who are still in need of therapies. By providing proliferation and activation signals targeted to NK cells  the tetra-specific NK Cell Engager based on our ANKET® platform leverages the advantages of harnessing NK cell effector functions against cancer cells. With a low systemic cytokine release profile  IPH6501 represents a promising alternative strategy to T cell therapies. IPH6501 continues to progress towards a Phase 1 clinical trial and we look forward to share further updates on other ANKET® assets as they enter clinic.""About ANKET®ANKET® is Innate’s proprietary platform for developing next-generation  multi-specific natural killer (NK) cell engagers to treat certain types of cancer.
