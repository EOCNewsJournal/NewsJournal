The fears have been fuelled by British chipmaker Arm London having snubbed London in favour of New York.Boujnah pointed to the fact that Euronext’s seven bourses have cumulatively hosted 24 fresh listings this year – double the 12 achieved by London.However  the London Stock Exchange primary markets boss Charlie Walker slammed Boujnah’s comments and said the comparison simply did not stack up.“Adding up volumes across the seven different exchanges which Euronext own and comparing them to the London Stock Exchange is a bit like comparing the points Manchester City have with the next seven largest teams combined because they have the same owner ” Walker told The Sunday Times.“Companies from all over the world and across different sectors come to London because they gain unrivalled access to an international investor base  deep pools of capital and liquidity ” he added.The City got a boost last week when two fresh IPOs were revealed  including a fintech payments firm which hailed the appeal of the capital as the home of innovation firms.Stock exchange officials and regulators have been looking to overhaul listing rules since Brexit in a bid to keep the City competitive and tempt more firms to come to market.The exchange’s chief Julia Hoggett has just kicked off a fresh review of the culture and narrative of the City in her role as the head of the Capital Markets Industry Taskforce to try and arrest the decline of the capital.A number of reviews have also been launched to overhaul areas including the secondary markets and investment research to try and make the UK’s capital markets ecosystem more attractive to companies.,neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,negative,0.0,0.08,0.92,True,English,"['London Stock Exchange executive', 'IPO barbs', 'Euronext', 'London Stock Exchange primary markets boss Charlie Walker', 'A London Stock Exchange executive', 'British chipmaker Arm London', 'next seven largest teams', 'The LOndon Stock exchange', 'Capital Markets Industry Taskforce', 'post-Brexit world” international listings', 'pan-European stock exchange', 'Stock exchange officials', 'seven European exchanges', 'The Sunday Times', 'international investor base', 'fintech payments firm', 'capital markets ecosystem', 'seven different exchanges', 'chief Julia Hoggett', 'two fresh IPOs', 'secondary markets', 'Euronext boss', 'international stage', 'seven bourses', '24 fresh listings', 'different sectors', 'The City', 'fresh review', 'IPO barbs', 'New York', 'same owner', 'unrivalled access', 'deep pools', 'listing rules', 'investment research', 'Euronext platforms', 'Manchester City', 'innovation firms', 'Stephane Boujnah', 'bruising', 'slump', 'UK', 'lustre', 'interview', 'comments', 'period', 'panic', 'fears', 'favour', 'fact', 'comparison', 'volumes', 'points', 'Companies', 'liquidity', 'boost', 'appeal', 'home', 'regulators', 'bid', 'culture', 'narrative', 'role', 'head', 'decline', 'number', 'reviews', 'areas']",2023-06-11,2023-06-12,cityam.com

OCI is obtaining the approvals and permits required to commercially bunker methanol in several ports  including Port of Rotterdam on the ship's voyage  positioning OCI as the first commercial bunker operator of methanol in these regions.Ready for marineThis voyage is an important milestone in the expansion of OCI's renewable and low-carbon fuels business  a key pillar of OCI's sustainable growth strategy. As the maritime industry navigates increased regulation to accelerate decarbonization  such as the FuelEU Maritime initiative  OCI anticipates incremental global demand for methanol at 4 million tons per year in the next five years  based on current orders from the marine sector.OCI is focused on being the last mile operator of choice at strategic bunkering ports  leveraging partnerships with relevant authorities  terminal infrastructure partners  and bunker barge operators.

We also appreciate the collaboration and leadership of our partners at each of the ports to facilitate this journey. With the maritime industry facing increasing regulatory scrutiny  its decarbonization is urgent  and OCI is playing a crucial role in helping the sector meet its environmental goals through our existing methanol capabilities; helping us build our position in the marine and fuels markets to capitalize on the coming ammonia fuel demand.""Bashir Lebada  CEO of OCI Methanol/HyFuels:""We are excited about this new phase of our methanol business. Marine has been the main buzz around methanol for several years  so to secure the first real green sale and voyage is testament to our team's hard work and further reinforces OCI HyFuels as the only large-scale green methanol solution for road and bunker. We welcome our partnership with Maersk and their leadership in decarbonizing the maritime sector; their early focus on methanol and conviction to order vessels has led us to where we are today. This also highlights our distribution system and last mile capabilities where we will continue to leverage our road fuel logistics and fuel blending system  and add to our green bunker barge fleet as demand grows.""Emma Mazhari  Head of Energy Markets at A.P.
