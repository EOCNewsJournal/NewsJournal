Entities and unincorporated arrangements over which Shell has joint control are generally referred to as “joint ventures” and “joint operations”  respectively. “Joint ventures” and “joint operations” are collectively referred to as “joint arrangements”.

All statements other than statements of historical fact are  or may be deemed to be  forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management’s current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking statements include  among other things  statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management’s expectations  beliefs  estimates  forecasts  projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as “aim”  “ambition”  ‘‘anticipate’’  ‘‘believe’’  ‘‘could’’  ‘‘estimate’’  ‘‘expect’’  ‘‘goals’’  ‘‘intend’’  ‘‘may’’  “milestones”  ‘‘objectives’’  ‘‘outlook’’  ‘‘plan’’  ‘‘probably’’  ‘‘project’’  ‘‘risks’’  “schedule”  ‘‘seek’’  ‘‘should’’  ‘‘target’’  ‘‘will’’ and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this announcement  including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell’s products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets  and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative  judicial  fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks  including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities  delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics  such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak; and (n) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this announcement are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc’s Form 20-F for the year ended December 31  2022 (available at www.shell.com/investor and www.sec.gov). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this announcement and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement  June 12  2023. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information  future events or other information. In light of these risks  results could differ materially from those stated  implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this announcement.Shell’s net carbon intensityAlso  in this announcement we may refer to Shell’s “Net Carbon Intensity”  which includes Shell’s carbon emissions from the production of our energy products  our suppliers’ carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers’ carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the term Shell’s “Net Carbon Intensity” is for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.Shell’s net-Zero Emissions TargetShell’s operating plan  outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly  they reflect our Scope 1  Scope 2 and Net Carbon Intensity (NCI) targets over the next ten years. However  Shell’s operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target and 2035 NCI target  as these targets are currently outside our planning period. In the future  as society moves towards net-zero emissions  we expect Shell’s operating plans to reflect this movement. However  if society is not net zero in 2050  as of today  there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.Forward Looking Non-GAAP measuresThis announcement may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as cash capital expenditure and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell  such as oil and gas prices  interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover  estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc’s consolidated financial statements.The contents of websites referred to in this announcement do not form part of this announcement.We may have used certain terms  such as resources  in this announcement that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC.

Christian Guillemot  chief executive officer and co-founder of AMA: « Many advances have been made since the IPO to foster growth in the market for assisted reality solutions for professionals in the field. Thanks to a sustained pace of innovation  our proprietary software  XpertEye  is increasingly easy to integrate into existing systems  and our new Enterprise Model commercial offer is driving sales momentum and wider deployment of our solutions. Today  we are carrying out this capital increase to maintain our solid financial position  and the confidence of our customers  mainly major international groups  in our ability to support them long term. In 2023  with the support of forthcoming innovations and a strengthened commercial strategy combining direct sales and distribution partnerships  we aim to confirm the inflection point in our order book recorded in recent weeks. For this transaction of around 7.99 million euros  the process for maintaining preferential subscription rights  or for setting up a priority subscription period  revealed major technical complexities  which could have compromised the smooth running of the operation. Nonetheless  we are keen to ensure that this operation is open to all  and its placement period reflects this. This is why the founding shareholders of the Guillemot family have decided to subscribe for 50 to 100% of the shares offered  thus guaranteeing its success ». Rationale for the Offer The Company plans to use the proceeds of the Offering to continue its strong financial position with reinforced shareholders’ equity while maintaining a high pace of innovation and an international sales strategy. Following the Offer  the Company would have a cash position in excess of 12 months  excluding the activation of financing lines already granted  amounting to €12 million at the date of this press release. Terms and conditions of the Offer Structure of the Offer Pursuant to the authorisation granted by the shareholders general meeting of 12 June 2023  the Offer concerns an issuance of 30 769 230 new ordinary shares with a nominal value of £0.125 (the “Offered Shares”) in the context of a capital increase with cancellation of the preferential subscription right of the shareholders  to be subscribed in cash in the context of a public offering  at the price of €0.26 per share  implying gross proceeds of € 7.99 million. As AMA is a public limited company under English law  a capital increase with preferential subscription rights  as well as the implementation of a priority subscription period  presented significant technical complexities  pertaining to (i) the identification of shareholders  (ii) the management of preferential subscription rights and (iii) the priority subscription period  likely to compromise the completion of the transaction within an efficient timeframe. For these reasons  the Company has opted for a capital increase without shareholders' preferential subscription rights. The subscription period will begin on Tuesday 13 June 2023 and will be open until Monday 26 June 2023 (included). Pursuant to Article 3 of the Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 of the European Parliament and Council of 14 June 2017 and article 211-2 of the General regulation of the French financial markets authority (Autorité des marchés financiers  “AMF”)  the Offer will not be subject to the preparation of a prospectus submitted to the approval of the AMF. Price of the Offer The offering price  determined by the board of directors  is €0.26 per new share  which represents a discount of 10.3% compared to the closing share price on 12th June 2023 (€0.29). Amount of the Offer The gross proceeds of the Offer amount to €7 999 999.80 million. The net proceeds of the Offer will be in the range of €7.6 million to €7.8 million. The Offer will not be covered by an over-allotment option. Subscription commitment of Guillemot Brothers The Guillemot family holds  directly and indirectly via Guillemot Brothers SAS  79 71% of the share capital and voting rights of the Company at the date of the present press release. The Guillemot family intends to ensure the success of the Offer and strongly hope that the Offer will be taken up as widely as possible in order to strengthen its free float. Therefore  Guillemot Brothers SAS  shareholder holding 34 38% of the share capital and voting rights of the Company  has committed to subscribe up to €7.99 million  representing 100% of the Offered Shares. The subscription orders placed by the other subscribers will be served in priority and the subscription of Guillemot Brothers will be consequently reduced  down to 50% of the capital increase  i.e. €4 million. The Company committed to TP ICAP Midcap not to issue new shares of the Company  with the exception of the Offered Shares  subject to certain customary exceptions  for 90 calendar days following the settlement date of the Offered Shares. Lock-up agreements Guillemot Brothers committed towards TP ICAP Midcap to a lock-up of 180 calendar days following the settlement date of the Offered Shares covering the entirety of the shares held as well as the entirety of the Offered Shares that will be subscribed in the context of the subscription commitment described above. Undertaking not to initiate a squeeze-out Should the free float be less than or equal to 10%  AMA will not be delisted. Accordingly  the Guillemot family and Guillemot Brothers undertake not to initiate a squeeze-out procedure during the twelve months following settlement of the Offer. The Guillemot family and the Company would like the free float of the Company to remain as high as possible and to be maintained within a range of 10% to 15%. In the event that the free float falls below this range  they will use the means at their disposal to increase the level of the free float. Financial intermediaries TP ICAP (Midcap) acts as Global Coordinator  Lead Manager and Bookrunner of the Offer. Characteristics of the new shares The new shares will be assimilated to the existing shares and will be subject to an application for admission to trading on Euronext Growth on the same trading line (ISIN code: GB00BNKGZC51 – ticker: ALAMA). They will bear current dividend rights and will carry full dividend rights paid out by the Company starting from their issue date. The new shares will be subject to the entirety of the provisions of the articles of association of the Company and of the Companies Act 2006 which applies to public limited companies of English law. As the Company is a public limited company governed by English law  the rules governing taxation  corporate governance  shareholder information and general meetings are those applicable under English law.Indicative timetable of the Offer 12/06/2023 Shareholders general meeting authorising the OfferDecision of the board of directors on the characteristics of the OfferEuronext notice on the launch of the Offer 13/06/2023 Opening of the subscription period 26/06/2023 Closing of the subscription period 28/06/2023 Decision of the board of directors setting the final characteristics of the OfferPress release announcing the outcome of the OfferEuronext notice regarding the issuance of the Offered Shares 30/06/2023 Settlement and delivery of the Offered SharesAdmission to trading of the Offered Shares on Euronext Growth Paris Terms and conditions of the subscription Placing of orders Persons wishing to participate in the Offer must submit their orders to an authorised financial intermediary in France no later than 26 June 2023 at 5pm (Paris time) for counter subscriptions and 8pm (Paris time) for online subscriptions  if that option is provided by their financial intermediary  unless the Offer is closed earlier or extended later than initially scheduled.

Thanks to a sustained pace of innovation  our proprietary software  XpertEye  is increasingly easy to integrate into existing systems  and our new Enterprise Model commercial offer is driving sales momentum and wider deployment of our solutions. Today  we are carrying out this capital increase to maintain our solid financial position  and the confidence of our customers  mainly major international groups  in our ability to support them long term. In 2023  with the support of forthcoming innovations and a strengthened commercial strategy combining direct sales and distribution partnerships  we aim to confirm the inflection point in our order book recorded in recent weeks.For this transaction of around 7.99 million euros  the process for maintaining preferential subscription rights  or for setting up a priority subscription period  revealed major technical complexities  which could have compromised the smooth running of the operation. Nonetheless  we are keen to ensure that this operation is open to all  and its placement period reflects this. This is why the founding shareholders of the Guillemot family have decided to subscribe for 50 to 100% of the shares offered  thus guaranteeing its success ».Rationale for the OfferThe Company plans to use the proceeds of the Offering to continue its strong financial position with reinforced shareholders’ equity while maintaining a high pace of innovation and an international sales strategy. Following the Offer  the Company would have a cash position in excess of 12 months  excluding the activation of financing lines already granted  amounting to €12 million at the date of this press release.Terms and conditions of the OfferStructure of the OfferPursuant to the authorisation granted by the shareholders general meeting of 12 June 2023  the Offer concerns an issuance of 30 769 230 new ordinary shares with a nominal value of £0.125 (the “Offered Shares”) in the context of a capital increase with cancellation of the preferential subscription right of the shareholders  to be subscribed in cash in the context of a public offering  at the price of €0.26 per share  implying gross proceeds of € 7.99 million.As AMA is a public limited company under English law  a capital increase with preferential subscription rights  as well as the implementation of a priority subscription period  presented significant technical complexities  pertaining to (i) the identification of shareholders  (ii) the management of preferential subscription rights and (iii) the priority subscription period  likely to compromise the completion of the transaction within an efficient timeframe. For these reasons  the Company has opted for a capital increase without shareholders' preferential subscription rights.The subscription period will begin on Tuesday 13 June 2023 and will be open until Monday 26 June 2023 (included).Pursuant to Article 3 of the Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 of the European Parliament and Council of 14 June 2017 and article 211-2 of the General regulation of the French financial markets authority (Autorité des marchés financiers  “AMF”)  the Offer will not be subject to the preparation of a prospectus submitted to the approval of the AMF.Price of the OfferThe offering price  determined by the board of directors  is €0.26 per new share  which represents a discount of 10.3% compared to the closing share price on 12th June 2023 (€0.29).Amount of the OfferThe gross proceeds of the Offer amount to €7 999 999.80 million. The net proceeds of the Offer will be in the range of €7.6 million to €7.8 million.The Offer will not be covered by an over-allotment option.Subscription commitment of Guillemot BrothersThe Guillemot family holds  directly and indirectly via Guillemot Brothers SAS  79 71% of the share capital and voting rights of the Company at the date of the present press release. The Guillemot family intends to ensure the success of the Offer and strongly hope that the Offer will be taken up as widely as possible in order to strengthen its free float. Therefore  Guillemot Brothers SAS  shareholder holding 34 38% of the share capital and voting rights of the Company  has committed to subscribe up to €7.99 million  representing 100% of the Offered Shares.The subscription orders placed by the other subscribers will be served in priority and the subscription of Guillemot Brothers will be consequently reduced  down to 50% of the capital increase  i.e. €4 million.The Company committed to TP ICAP Midcap not to issue new shares of the Company  with the exception of the Offered Shares  subject to certain customary exceptions  for 90 calendar days following the settlement date of the Offered Shares.Lock-up agreementsGuillemot Brothers committed towards TP ICAP Midcap to a lock-up of 180 calendar days following the settlement date of the Offered Shares covering the entirety of the shares held as well as the entirety of the Offered Shares that will be subscribed in the context of the subscription commitment described above.Undertaking not to initiate a squeeze-outShould the free float be less than or equal to 10%  AMA will not be delisted. Accordingly  the Guillemot family and Guillemot Brothers undertake not to initiate a squeeze-out procedure during the twelve months following settlement of the Offer.The Guillemot family and the Company would like the free float of the Company to remain as high as possible and to be maintained within a range of 10% to 15%. In the event that the free float falls below this range  they will use the means at their disposal to increase the level of the free float.Financial intermediariesTP ICAP (Midcap) acts as Global Coordinator  Lead Manager and Bookrunner of the Offer.Characteristics of the new sharesThe new shares will be assimilated to the existing shares and will be subject to an application for admission to trading on Euronext Growth on the same trading line (ISIN code: GB00BNKGZC51 – ticker: ALAMA). They will bear current dividend rights and will carry full dividend rights paid out by the Company starting from their issue date.The new shares will be subject to the entirety of the provisions of the articles of association of the Company and of the Companies Act 2006 which applies to public limited companies of English law.As the Company is a public limited company governed by English law  the rules governing taxation  corporate governance  shareholder information and general meetings are those applicable under English law.Indicative timetable of the Offer12/06/2023 Shareholders general meeting authorising the OfferDecision of the board of directors on the characteristics of the OfferEuronext notice on the launch of the Offer 13/06/2023 Opening of the subscription period 26/06/2023 Closing of the subscription period 28/06/2023 Decision of the board of directors setting the final characteristics of the OfferPress release announcing the outcome of the OfferEuronext notice regarding the issuance of the Offered Shares 30/06/2023 Settlement and delivery of the Offered SharesAdmission to trading of the Offered Shares on Euronext Growth ParisTerms and conditions of the subscriptionPlacing of ordersPersons wishing to participate in the Offer must submit their orders to an authorised financial intermediary in France no later than 26 June 2023 at 5pm (Paris time) for counter subscriptions and 8pm (Paris time) for online subscriptions  if that option is provided by their financial intermediary  unless the Offer is closed earlier or extended later than initially scheduled.Form and registration of the Offered SharesThe procedures for the subscription and registration of the Offered Shares are governed by the laws of England and Wales  which require that the shares be subscribed for and registered in the Company's share register handled by Link Group (Central Square  10th Floor  29 Wellington Street  Leeds  England  LS1 4DL).The Offered Shares will be delivered in book-entry form only and will be credited to the relevant securities accounts via Euroclear France  66 rue de la Victoire 75009 Paris  France.

Under an agreement  OCI Global (Euronext:...,Danish shipping giant Maersk has secured the green methanol fuel for the maiden voyage of its first dual-fuel containership under construction in South Korea.Under an agreement  OCI Global (Euronext: OCI) will supply Maersk with the ISCC certified green biomethanol for the ship’s maiden voyage this summer to Northern Europe via the Suez Canal. The vessel will bunker at several major ports along the way  including the Port of Rotterdam.The feeder ship  with a capacity of 2 100 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU)  is the first of nineteen carbon-neutral green methanol-powered ships that Maersk has on order. It measures 172 meters in length and was commissioned in July 2021. Once in service  the vessel will operate on a Baltic route connecting Northern Europe and the Bay of Bothnia.The other 18 dual-fuel ships will be much larger (16 000 and 17 000 TEU capacity) and are being built by Hyundai Heavy Industries with deliveries in 2024 and 2025.Maersk has been busy lining up partners on the supply green methanol for the fleet.OCI Global  known for its OCI HyFuels brand  has been at the forefront of green methanol development and is a leading supplier in the field. The company has played a pivotal role in advancing the application of green methanol in vehicles and currently supplies up to 200 000 tons per year equivalent. The company is now in the process of expanding its range of low-carbon and green methanol products  which now includes biomethanol  e-methanol  recycled carbon fuel (RCF) methanol  renewable natural gas  ethanol  and bio-MTBE.With the maritime industry facing mounting pressure to expedite its decarbonization efforts  OCI foresees a significant rise in global demand for methanol  with an estimated 4 million tons per year increase in the next five years  driven by current orders from the marine sector.Earlier this year  OCI announced a partnership with Unibarge to retrofit the first methanol-powered bunker barge  which will be deployed at the Port of Rotterdam.“This marks another significant milestone in our global leadership in supplying and trading renewable and low-carbon fuels to decarbonize energy-intensive industries ” said Ahmed El-Hoshy  CEO at OCI Global. “We also appreciate the collaboration and leadership of our partners at each of the ports to facilitate this journey. With the maritime industry facing increasing regulatory scrutiny  its decarbonization is urgent  and OCI is playing a crucial role in helping the sector meet its environmental goals through our existing methanol capabilities. This positions us well in the marine and fuels markets to capitalize on the forthcoming ammonia fuel demand.”,neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,positive,0.94,0.06,0.0,True,English,"['Green Methanol Supply', 'First Dual-Fuel Containership', 'Maiden Voyage', 'Maersk', 'nineteen carbon-neutral green methanol-powered ships', 'first methanol-powered bunker barge', 'forthcoming ammonia fuel demand', 'Danish shipping giant Maersk', 'ISCC certified green biomethanol', 'other 18 dual-fuel ships', 'first dual-fuel containership', '2,100 twenty-foot equivalent units', 'next five years', 'increasing regulatory scrutiny', 'Hyundai Heavy Industries', 'green methanol fuel', 'green methanol development', 'green methanol products', 'existing methanol capabilities', 'several major ports', 'renewable natural gas', 'OCI HyFuels brand', 'carbon fuel', 'global demand', 'energy-intensive industries', 'RCF) methanol', 'maiden voyage', 'South Korea', 'Northern Europe', 'Suez Canal', 'Baltic route', 'leading supplier', 'pivotal role', 'to 200,000 tons', 'maritime industry', 'mounting pressure', 'significant rise', '4 million tons', 'current orders', 'significant milestone', 'Ahmed El-Hoshy', 'crucial role', 'environmental goals', 'fuels markets', 'OCI Global', 'feeder ship', 'decarbonization efforts', 'year increase', 'global leadership', '17,000 TEU capacity', 'marine sector', 'low-carbon', 'construction', 'agreement', 'vessel', 'way', 'Rotterdam', '172 meters', 'length', 'July', 'service', 'Bay', 'Bothnia', 'deliveries', 'partners', 'supply', 'fleet', 'forefront', 'field', 'company', 'application', 'vehicles', 'process', 'range', 'bio-MTBE', 'Unibarge', 'trading', 'CEO', 'collaboration', 'journey', '6,000']",2023-06-12,2023-06-13,gcaptain.com

PEDFIC 1 was a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase III trial that evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of Bylvay in reducing pruritus and serum bile acids (sBAs) in children with PFIC  and PEDFIC 2 is a long-term  open-label Phase III extension trial. Patients with PFIC have impaired bile flow  or cholestasis  and the resulting bile build-up in liver cells causes liver disease and symptoms  such as intense itching  poor sleep  delayed growth  and diminished quality of life. The harmful impacts of the disease extend to parents and caregivers  as the 2022 multinational PICTURE trial revealed that PFIC negatively affects caregivers’ quality of life  relationships  and career prospects.About the Phase III ASSERT trialASSERT is a gold standard  prospective intervention trial with 32 sites across North America  Europe  Middle East  and Asia Pacific. The double-blind  randomized  placebo-controlled trial was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 120 µg /kg/day Bylvay for 24 weeks in relieving pruritus in patients with ALGS. Key secondary endpoints measure serum bile acid levels and safety and tolerability. The trial enrolled patients aged 0 to 17 years of age with a genetically confirmed diagnosis of ALGS. In the primary analysis  the trial met the primary endpoint showing statistically significant reduction in pruritus as measured by the PRUCISION Observer-Reported Outcome scratching score (0-4 point scale)  from baseline at month 6 (weeks 21 to 24)  compared to the placebo arm (p=0.002). Over 90% of patients were pruritus responders during the trial  as defined as at least a 1-point drop at any time point. The trial also met the key secondary endpoint showing a statistically significant reduction in serum bile acid concentration from baseline to the average of weeks 20 and 24 (compared to the placebo arm p=0.001). Statistically significant improvements in multiple sleep parameters were observed as early as week 1-4 compared to patients on placebo with continued improvement through week 24. In the trial  there were no patient discontinuations. Bylvay was well tolerated  with an overall adverse event incidence similar to placebo and a low incidence of drug-related diarrhea (11.4% vs. 5.9% placebo).About Bylvay® (odevixibat)Bylvay is a potent  once-daily  non-systemic IBATi that acts locally in the small intestine and has minimal systemic exposure. It is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of pruritus in patients three months of age and older with PFIC  where it has orphan exclusivity. Bylvay was first launched as a treatment option for patients with PFIC in the U.S. in 2021  where it is supported by a program designed to assist with access to treatment and patient support. Bylvay is also approved in the E.U. for the treatment of PFIC in patients aged six months or older.

The PFSF 7a consists of 7 items that measure both the experience of fatigue and interference of fatigue on daily activities over the past 7 days using a Likert response scale. Patients were asked to evaluate the PBC WI NRS and PFSF 7a on ease of understanding of instructions and items  ease of use of scale/response options  and appropriateness of recall period to capture the patient experience. Interviews were conducted by experienced qualitative researchers  and audio recordings were transcribed and analyzed with coding software.About ElafibranorElafibranor is a novel  oral  once-daily  dual peroxisome activated receptor (PPAR) alpha/delta (α δ) agonist  currently under investigation as treatment for patients with PBC  a rare liver disease.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law. Ipsen’s business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers.

Lhyfe (EURONEXT: LHYFE) is one of the world's pioneers in green and renewable hydrogen production and a pioneer in offshore hydrogen production projects Capital Energy is a Spanish energy producer and distributor founded over twenty years ago and which aspires to become the first 100% renewable vertically integrated energy operator on the Iberian Peninsula.Under the agreement  the two companies will work together to create hydrogen production sites at some of the offshore wind farm sites currently being developed by Capital Energy. The Spanish energy company already has a development pipeline of more than 7.5 gigawatts (GW) in both countries.For Lhyfe and Capital Energy  the joint installation of offshore wind farms and hydrogen production sites would have considerable benefits  mainly in two key areas: economic benefits through the economies of scale achieved  and social benefits through the growing industrial overlap of the projects  given that a greater number and variety of suppliers and specialists will be required.Such initiatives will also benefit the energy system as a whole as the wind energy produced in these wind farms would be more controllable  avoiding curtailments. And in some cases it would be possible to send less power to the grid (e.g. in case of congestion of the grid) and more to the hydrogen production unit  to which some of the wind turbines would be directly connected.The collaboration agreement signed between Capital Energy and Lhyfe could be extended to other markets in the future.Lhyfe is the only company in the world to have an operational prototype for offshore green hydrogen production. This system  known as Sealhyfe  was inaugurated in France in September 2022. The company aims to have 200 MW of green hydrogen production capacity by the end of 2026 and 3 GW by the end of 2030. With projects in 11 countries  Lhyfe has over 149 staff dedicated entirely to renewable hydrogen production.Pablo Alcón  Offshore Director at Capital Energy said: “We have been committed with developing green hydrogen projects on the Iberian Peninsula for the past years and it was time to take the step into offshore  so we have joined forces with the best possible partner  Lhyfe  which has substantial experience in offshore hydrogen production. Through this alliance  we intend to use some of the energy generated by our offshore wind farms to produce hydrogen  which will help to drive the energy transition in a balanced way and solve potential bottlenecks in the electricity system. It will also increase the socio-economic benefits of our offshore projects  with greater investment and more skilled jobs.”Taia Kronborg  Chief Business Officer at Lhyfe said: “This agreement with Capital Energy is a tremendous opportunity to foster the transition to clean energy through the large-scale production of green hydrogen at sea. Producing H2 via electrolysis at sea will maximise the immense potential of offshore wind energy. Countries with a coastline  such as Spain and Portugal  can drastically reduce their dependence on fossil fuels and improve their national energy security  while producing net-zero emissions and boosting local economies.”For an interview with the spokespersons above  please contact the press department.Click to access the Lhyfe Media Kit (press kit and visuals)Lhyfe is a European group devoted to energy transition  and a producer and supplier of green and renewable hydrogen. Its production sites and portfolio of projects intend to provide access to green and renewable hydrogen in industrial quantities  and enable the creation of a virtuous energy model capable of decarbonising entire sectors of industry and transport. In 2021  Lhyfe inaugurated the first industrial-scale green hydrogen production plant in the world to be interconnected with a wind farm. In 2022  Lhyfe inaugurated the first offshore green hydrogen production pilot platform in the world. Lhyfe is represented in 11 European countries and had 149 staff at the end of 2022. The company is listed on the Euronext market in Paris (ISIN: FR0014009YQ1 – LHYFE). Lhyfe.comCapital Energy is a Spanish integrated utility committed with the green energy transition. The group currently has the largest portfolio of onshore wind and solar energy projects on the Iberian Peninsula amounting to over 25 gigawatts (GW) of power  as well as 7.5 GW of offshore wind projects in development.

With the completion of enrollment  Oxurion confirms its previous guidance that it expects to report top-line data from the KALAHARI trial in the fourth quarter of 2023.The KALAHARI trial is evaluating Oxurion’s novel plasma kallikrein (PKal) inhibitor THR-149 as a potential treatment for DME patients who respond suboptimally to anti-VEGF therapy  the current standard of care. The completion of enrollment follows the recommendation from an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) in December 2022 that the KALAHARI trial should continue based on the outcome of a pre-specified futility analysis that included an evaluation of interim efficacy and safety data from 31 patients at the three-month time point.Diabetic Macular Edema (DME)Approximately 22 million people worldwide have DME currently  with prevalence increasing due to the growing global diabetic epidemic. DME is the leading cause of vision loss in working-age people  and the market for treatments is currently estimated at +$5 billion.People who suffer from DME have leaking vessels in the back of the eye  leading to a thickening of the retina that causes vision problems such as blurriness in the center of vision  the appearance of dark spots or patches in the field of vision  and colors to look dull. These symptoms may affect the ability to read  write  drive  and recognize faces – presenting a significant patient and caregiver burden.About THR-149THR-149 is a bicyclic peptide that selectively inhibits human plasma kallikrein (PKal) with an inhibition constant of 0.22 nM. Through the inhibition of the kallikrein-kinin system (KKS)  THR-149 prevents the induction of retinal vascular permeability  neurodegeneration  and inflammation. THR-149 is currently being evaluated in the KALAHARI Phase 2  Part B clinical trial as a potential treatment for patients who respond suboptimally to anti-VEGF the standard of care for treatment of DME.KALAHARI Phase 2  Part BThe Phase 2 KALAHARI trial is a two-part  randomized  prospective  multi-center trial assessing multiple (3) injections of THR-149 in DME patients. Part B is double-masked and actively controlled  with the high dose of THR-149 having been selected from Part A of the trial. Part B of the trial is enrolling approximately 108 patients who have previously shown a suboptimal response to anti-VEGF therapy  and where THR-149 is being evaluated against aflibercept  the current standard of care  as the active comparator.KALAHARI Phase 2  Part APart A of the KALAHARI trial demonstrated that all dose levels of THR-149 had a favorable safety profile. All adverse events in the study eye were mild to moderate in intensity and no severe ocular adverse events were reported and no inflammation was observed. High-level data from Part A of the KALAHARI trial was first presented in October 2021  which demonstrated that the eight patients who received the highest dose of THR-149 achieved a mean BCVA gain of 6.1 letters at Month 3  the primary endpoint.A post-hoc analysis was performed by the masked central reading center in February 2022 based on an OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography) biomarker assessment. The analysis identified two subjects with abnormalities at baseline  which could impact responsiveness to any medical treatment. Excluding these two subjects resulted in an improvement in mean BCVA of 9.3 letters at Month 3  which was sustained until Month 6  the end of the trial  and four months after the last THR-149 injection. The Month 6 data also demonstrated THR-149’s attractive safety profile and its ability to stabilize the Central Subfield Thickness (CST). The learnings from the Part A data were incorporated into Part B through an amended trial design excluding patients that would not respond to any treatment.

These stTokens can then also be traded on the secondary market and used within DeFi applications  a process known as “liquid staking.” Liquid staking allows users to access the benefits of staking without facing lock-up periods or high minimum staking amounts that can place staking out-of-reach for many everyday investors. Lido is the largest liquid staking provider  responsible for $13.33B in total value locked out of the combined $19.53B in total value locked across the space as a whole. With the 21Shares Lido DAO ETP  investors have a simplified and secure way to gain exposure to the growth of liquid staking through an ETP that is fully collateralized  with institutional grade security and custody solutions.""The 21Shares Lido DAO ETP was launched to offer investors exposure to liquid staking  one of the fastest-growing segments in the digital asset space "" said Arthur Krause  Director of ETP Product at 21Shares.

Thanks to a sustained pace of innovation  our proprietary software  XpertEye  is increasingly easy to integrate into existing systems  and our new Enterprise Model commercial offer is driving sales momentum and wider deployment of our solutions. Today  we are carrying out this capital increase to maintain our solid financial position  and the confidence of our customers  mainly major international groups  in our ability to support them long term. In 2023  with the support of forthcoming innovations and a strengthened commercial strategy combining direct sales and distribution partnerships  we aim to confirm the inflection point in our order book recorded in recent weeks.For this transaction of around 7.99 million euros  the process for maintaining preferential subscription rights  or for setting up a priority subscription period  revealed major technical complexities  which could have compromised the smooth running of the operation. Nonetheless  we are keen to ensure that this operation is open to all  and its placement period reflects this. This is why the founding shareholders of the Guillemot family have decided to subscribe for 50 to 100% of the shares offered  thus guaranteeing its success ».Rationale for the OfferThe Company plans to use the proceeds of the Offering to continue its strong financial position with reinforced shareholders’ equity while maintaining a high pace of innovation and an international sales strategy. Following the Offer  the Company would have a cash position in excess of 12 months  excluding the activation of financing lines already granted  amounting to €12 million at the date of this press release.Terms and conditions of the OfferStructure of the OfferPursuant to the authorisation granted by the shareholders general meeting of 12 June 2023  the Offer concerns an issuance of 30 769 230 new ordinary shares with a nominal value of £0.125 (the “Offered Shares”) in the context of a capital increase with cancellation of the preferential subscription right of the shareholders  to be subscribed in cash in the context of a public offering  at the price of €0.26 per share  implying gross proceeds of € 7.99 million.As AMA is a public limited company under English law  a capital increase with preferential subscription rights  as well as the implementation of a priority subscription period  presented significant technical complexities  pertaining to (i) the identification of shareholders  (ii) the management of preferential subscription rights and (iii) the priority subscription period  likely to compromise the completion of the transaction within an efficient timeframe.

Christian Guillemot  chief executive officer and co-founder of AMA: « Many advances have been made since the IPO to foster growth in the market for assisted reality solutions for professionals in the field. Thanks to a sustained pace of innovation  our proprietary software  XpertEye  is increasingly easy to integrate into existing systems  and our new Enterprise Model commercial offer is driving sales momentum and wider deployment of our solutions. Today  we are carrying out this capital increase to maintain our solid financial position  and the confidence of our customers  mainly major international groups  in our ability to support them long term. In 2023  with the support of forthcoming innovations and a strengthened commercial strategy combining direct sales and distribution partnerships  we aim to confirm the inflection point in our order book recorded in recent weeks. For this transaction of around 7.99 million euros  the process for maintaining preferential subscription rights  or for setting up a priority subscription period  revealed major technical complexities  which could have compromised the smooth running of the operation. Nonetheless  we are keen to ensure that this operation is open to all  and its placement period reflects this. This is why the founding shareholders of the Guillemot family have decided to subscribe for 50 to 100% of the shares offered  thus guaranteeing its success ». Rationale for the Offer The Company plans to use the proceeds of the Offering to continue its strong financial position with reinforced shareholders’ equity while maintaining a high pace of innovation and an international sales strategy.

The Q2 survey highlights the emergence of flexibility as a currency for workers in both blue and grey collar industries. As these employees seek to enjoy the flexibility the pandemic awarded to office workers  many employers risk upsetting their staff if they don't act.""Although flexible work started as a white-collar discussion  it has clearly permeated to both blue and grey collar sectors. As the most equitable and specialized talent company  we encourage employers across every industry to make a concerted effort to keep up with the changing priorities of their employees "" said Greg Dyer  Chief Commercial Officer at Randstad USA. ""This past quarter's Workmonitor Pulse survey is further proof that we are in an evolving job market.""Specific insights from the United States include:Two fifths of blue collar workers (42%) and close to half of grey collar workers (48%) deem flexibility at work as important  or more important  than payBlue and grey collar workers prioritize flexibility in terms of working schedule (29% and 28% respectively) and number of hours worked (25.7% and 17.1%% respectively)Although it is usually viewed through the prism of remote work  flexibility means different things for different industries Spending time with family and friends (blue collar - 61% & grey collar - 52.8%)  having more time to rest (blue collar - 50.9% & grey collar - 39.3%) and getting healthy and fit (blue collar - 42.8% & grey collar - 38.6%) are all reasons that blue and grey collar workers are looking for increased flexibility. Whereas  white collar workers are most likely to value flexibility in terms of location (46% )Despite the growing demand  many workers say their employers have still not made changes 41.3% of blue collar  and 40.1% of grey collar professionals believe their employer is not trying hard enough to provide flexibility Only 19.7% of blue collar  and 32.3% of grey collar professionals have seen increased flexibility since the pandemic. This is compared to over half (52.5%) of white collar office workersOffering flexibility to non-office workers is no longer an option - it is a business imperative  as they are willing to take action if it is not prioritized 45% of blue collar and 42.1% of grey collar professionals have left a job or changed careers due to lack of flexibility 36.8% of blue collar & 34.2% of grey collar professionals have taken sick days to manage personal responsibilities""The Workmonitor pulse report reiterates that blue and grey collar employees are craving additional flexibility in their careers "" continued Dyer.

Cambridge  MA (U.S.) and Lyon (France)  June 12  2023  7:00 am CEST – ERYTECH Pharma (Nasdaq & Euronext: ERYP)  today reacts to a series of disinformation attempts by Akkadian Partners to try and destabilize ERYTECH. “The activist investor that is trying to stop the merger project with Pherecydes  and in doing so willing to take the risk to destroy shareholder value of two companies  is using incomplete and erroneous information to destabilize ERYTECH”  said Gil Beyen  Chief Executive Officer of ERYTECH. “The proposed merger  announced in February this year  is the culmination of an intensive search of strategic alternatives for our company. It was carried out with specialized advice over more than a year and included in-depth examination of several dozen potential projects. It relies on strong operational complementarities and synergies. Its terms were freely negotiated between two independent companies and in the absence of any conflict of interest. These terms are balanced and based on a fair and equitable exchange parity  which was confirmed by an independent and well renowned  court-appointed expert. We remain more than ever convinced it is the best option for our company and its shareholders. Akkadian  with a minority stake in ERYTECH  has embarked in a communication strategy and an attempt to take a creeping control of the company by deceiving other shareholders into unfounded doubts on the transaction  instead of being transparent on their true intent and plans. To the best of our knowledge  Akkadian’s predation of ERYTECH’s corporate structure and cash will not support ideas of sufficient quality and robustness to create value for the company and its shareholders  on the contrary. Anybody who really  sincerely wants to save ERYTECH  should be allowed to vote at the General Assembly on June 23 and support ERYTECH’s merger project.” On February 15  2023  ERYTECH announced the strategic combination with PHERECYDES  a biotechnology company specializing in precision phage therapy to treat resistant and/or complicated bacterial infections  with the ambition to create a global leader in extended phage therapy and accelerate the development of a portfolio of phage candidates targeting pathogenic bacteria. The proposed transaction is structured as a merger of PHERECYDES into ERYTECH  pursuant to which PHERECYDES shareholders will receive 15 new ERYTECH shares for every 4 PHERECYDES shares they own. On 13 April  Akkadian Partners  an entity domiciled in Luxembourg  crossed the threshold of 5% of the share capital of ERYTECH Pharma. On May 1  Akkadian Partners informed the Board of ERYTECH that they intended to oppose the project of merging with Pherecydes and take de facto control of ERYTECH with a view to pursue alternative acquisition ideas with ERYTECH's cash. On May 9  ERYTECH informed Akkadian that its board of directors  after due consideration  had determined that these ideas  were not in the best interest of ERYTECH and its stakeholders  remote from ERYTECH’s strategy and identity  and with significant uncertainty and risks associated. The board confirmed the strategic merger with PHERECYDES as the best option forward and stated that it will oppose any financial predation project which would not be in the best interest of the company and its stakeholders. It is worth to note that the most advanced idea brought forward by Akkadian was to take control of a U.S. company with a dubious history and whose founder had been convicted financial fraud  which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States a few weeks ago On May 15  an independent merger appraiser (Commissaire à la fusion)  appointed by the commercial court  has reviewed the fairness of the exchange ratio for the Proposed Merger and issued its reports. In accordance with applicable law  such reports have been made publicly available  including on ERYTECH’s website. On May 15  AKKADIAN has started a disinformation campaign with press releases  press interviews and creation of a dedicated website  to incite ERYTECH’s shareholders to vote against the merger with PHERECYDES at the upcoming General Assembly. This campaign contains significant misrepresentations  errors and blunt defamation notably by alleging the perpetration of a fraud as well as the criminal offense of abuse of power. On June 7  Akkadian  who had announced its ""firm commitment"" to ERYTECH’s Board on May 1 to hold 15% of the company’s share capital in the very short term and then increase its stake to 25%  declared in Court to own 1 850 000 shares of ERYTECH as of May 24  still representing only 5.4% of the company’s share capital and 5.2% of the voting rights. The key arguments brough forward by Akkadian against the merger with Pherecydes are: Valuation and exchange ratioAkkadian states that there is no valuable reason to support the concept of a merger of equals  notwithstanding that this ratio has been validated by FINEXSI  a well-respected  independent appraiser  appointed by the President of the Commercial Court of Lyon (Commissaire à la fusion). FINEXSI is one of the most experienced judiciary experts in the field of merger and asset contribution audits  and independent appraisals of takeover bids within the meaning of the AMF General Regulation. As stated in its reports  FINEXSI conducted its work in accordance with ""the professional doctrine of the Compagnie Nationale des Commissaires aux Comptes” applicable to this assignment"". FINEXSI had access to a wide range of documentation and was able to interview all the management teams of the two companies involved in the merger. In accordance with applicable professional standards  FINEXSI has conducted a multicriteria analysis of the valuation of both ERYTECH and PHERECYDES  including asset values  market valuations at different periods and business plans and “Discounted Cash Flows” evaluations. The analysis of FINEXSI confirms the fairness of the proposed exchange parity for the merger. To challenge the merger exchange ratio  Akkadian privately appointed a consultant  Abergel. This consultant acknowledges that they only had limited information available  i.e. much less than the court-appointed appraiser. They raise a number of questions and make erroneous conclusions that can be attributed to this lack of information and certain misunderstandings. Akkadian and its consultant argue that ERYTECH is undervalued compared to Pherecydes in the merger agreement and that the exchange ratio is not valid. To support this  they point at:a) ERYTECH’s cash balance of €30M at the end of March 2023 (€38M at the end of 2022). They forget to mention that ERYTECH has outstanding loans (€10M at the end of 2022)  a significant amount of accounts payable (€5.1M at the end of 2022)  and an operational use of cash  which will significantly limit the amount of available cash  except if it can be used for value creating projects  which is the whole idea of the merger  to make sure that the remaining assets and cash can be used to create value instead of losing its value.b) Disparity between the market valuation of both companies. It is true that based on market capitalizations  the valuation of ERYTECH is currently almost twice as high as the one of Pherecydes. It should be noted  however  that earlier this year  ERYTECH’s market value was less than half of today’s value and that at the time of the signature of the “letter of intent” for the merger  both companies had almost equal market capitalizations. ERYTECH’s market capitalization has experienced a significant volatility in the recent period  also potentially driven by the speculative context created by the activist investor.c) Akkadian and its consultant suggest that ERYTECH has active projects and value creation potential that it is not pursuing  such as attempting to get European approval for GRASPA in ALL  selling its manufacturing facility in France or leveraging its carry forward losses. These erroneous opinions  brought forward despite the information possessed by Akkadian  show the lack of seriousness or sincerity of their allegations: Trying to get approval for GRASPA has unfortunately shown to be impossible. ERYTECH has tried to achieve this at multiple occasions and with the help of the best experts  but after two attempts in Europe and one in the USA  it has become clear that regulatory hurdles are not surmountable with the available product and clinical evidence. This was continuously explained at several public oral and written communications between 2018 and 2022  and in November 2022  Erytech announced it abandoned further development of GRASPA considering the multiple clinical and regulatory setbacks endured on that platform. Akkadian’s proposal to try again European approval for GRASPA in ALL is at best a blatant lack of knowledge in drug development  and also a blatant lack of sincerity while they  in the same time  proclaim their intent to avoid any drug development activity if in control of ERYTECH. Selling the Lyon manufacturing facility might be an option  but also here  multiple attempts have not been successful. The best option to create value from the manufacturing site might be to reserve it for Pherecydes programs once they get to the next stage of volume requirements. Another error to note in Akkadian’s allegations is that ERYTECH would have the majority of its remaining personnel working in the facility in view of its sale. In reality no personnel is employed in the manufacturing site since the end of 2022 and the current staff is focused on R&D activities and corporate obligations of a listed company. Carry forward losses: as explained in a report  mandated by Akkadian  and publicly available  the exploitation of the carry forward losses ERYTECH has built up over the years is subject to specific conditions. ERYTECH’s carry forward losses could be kept as a tax asset only if the company stayed in the same line of business of drug development activities  while it most likely would disappear with Akkadian’s alternative ideas of activities that have no link at all with ERYTECH’s past activities and nature of business. Here again  Akkadian’s allegations are at best a lack of knowledge  but conveying a misleading message to the company’s shareholders. Conflict of interestThe search of strategic alternatives has been performed in close collaboration with a specialist international advisor  and closely monitored by ERYTECH’s board of directors  which  with exception of the CEO per the nature of his mandate  consisted entirely of independent directors.The first phase of this exercise  that started in November 2021  immediately after the negative results of the Phase 3 trial in pancreatic cancer  has led to the sale of the manufacturing site in Princeton to Catalent. In the second phase  that started in May 2022  discussions with more than 50 companies have taken place and multiple letters of intent (LOI) have been negotiated and evaluated. This resulted in January 2023 to the prioritization of the merger option with Pherecydes and the signature of an LOI  which formed the basis for the merger agreement. The terms of the merger were freely negotiated between two independent companies and in the absence of any conflict of interest. Better alternative projectsAkkadian claims to have better alternatives for Erytech. So far only two ideas have been presented by Akkadian  who however proclaimed that they would stay away from any drug development activity in any case. The ideas they brought were potential opportunities to take control of other companies  without any clarity on the stage of discussions and the likelihood of potential conversions. Both projects were far remote from ERYTECH’s strategy and competence basis  and were associated with significant uncertainty and risks. It is worth to note that the most advanced idea brought forward by Akkadian  which was to take control of a U.S. company with a dubious history and whose founder had been condemned for financial fraud  filed for Chapter 11 a few weeks ago. Finally  it is important to note that a failure of the merger would only lead to the destruction of value for ERYTECH and its shareholders. Indeed  should the merger fail  it is unlikely that ERYTECH will be able to implement any alternative project due to the complexity of and time needed for such projects with  in practice  the risk for ERYTECH to be forced to enter into a liquidative mode until the total extinction of its resources.About ERYTECH ERYTECH is a biopharmaceutical company developing innovative red blood cell-based therapeutics for severe forms of cancer and orphan diseases.

It was carried out with specialized advice over more than a year and included in-depth examination of several dozen potential projects. It relies on strong operational complementarities and synergies. Its terms were freely negotiated between two independent companies and in the absence of any conflict of interest. These terms are balanced and based on a fair and equitable exchange parity  which was confirmed by an independent and well renowned  court-appointed expert. We remain more than ever convinced it is the best option for our company and its shareholders. Akkadian  with a minority stake in ERYTECH  has embarked in a communication strategy and an attempt to take a creeping control of the company by deceiving other shareholders into unfounded doubts on the transaction  instead of being transparent on their true intent and plans. To the best of our knowledge  Akkadian’s predation of ERYTECH’s corporate structure and cash will not support ideas of sufficient quality and robustness to create value for the company and its shareholders  on the contrary. Anybody who really  sincerely wants to save ERYTECH  should be allowed to vote at the General Assembly on June 23 and support ERYTECH’s merger project.”On February 15  2023  ERYTECH announced the strategic combination with PHERECYDES  a biotechnology company specializing in precision phage therapy to treat resistant and/or complicated bacterial infections  with the ambition to create a global leader in extended phage therapy and accelerate the development of a portfolio of phage candidates targeting pathogenic bacteria. The proposed transaction is structured as a merger of PHERECYDES into ERYTECH  pursuant to which PHERECYDES shareholders will receive 15 new ERYTECH shares for every 4 PHERECYDES shares they own.On 13 April  Akkadian Partners  an entity domiciled in Luxembourg  crossed the threshold of 5% of the share capital of ERYTECH Pharma.On May 1  Akkadian Partners informed the Board of ERYTECH that they intended to oppose the project of merging with Pherecydes and take de facto control of ERYTECH with a view to pursue alternative acquisition ideas with ERYTECH's cash.On May 9  ERYTECH informed Akkadian that its board of directors  after due consideration  had determined that these ideas  were not in the best interest of ERYTECH and its stakeholders  remote from ERYTECH’s strategy and identity  and with significant uncertainty and risks associated. The board confirmed the strategic merger with PHERECYDES as the best option forward and stated that it will oppose any financial predation project which would not be in the best interest of the company and its stakeholders. It is worth to note that the most advanced idea brought forward by Akkadian was to take control of a U.S. company with a dubious history and whose founder had been convicted financial fraud  which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the United States a few weeks agoOn May 15  an independent merger appraiser (Commissaire à la fusion)  appointed by the commercial court  has reviewed the fairness of the exchange ratio for the Proposed Merger and issued its reports. In accordance with applicable law  such reports have been made publicly available  including on ERYTECH’s website.On May 15  AKKADIAN has started a disinformation campaign with press releases  press interviews and creation of a dedicated website  to incite ERYTECH’s shareholders to vote against the merger with PHERECYDES at the upcoming General Assembly. This campaign contains significant misrepresentations  errors and blunt defamation notably by alleging the perpetration of a fraud as well as the criminal offense of abuse of power.On June 7  Akkadian  who had announced its ""firm commitment"" to ERYTECH’s Board on May 1 to hold 15% of the company’s share capital in the very short term and then increase its stake to 25%  declared in Court to own 1 850 000 shares of ERYTECH as of May 24  still representing only 5.4% of the company’s share capital and 5.2% of the voting rights.The key arguments brough forward by Akkadian against the merger with Pherecydes are:Valuation and exchange ratioAkkadian states that there is no valuable reason to support the concept of a merger of equals  notwithstanding that this ratio has been validated by FINEXSI  a well-respected  independent appraiser  appointed by the President of the Commercial Court of Lyon (Commissaire à la fusion). FINEXSI is one of the most experienced judiciary experts in the field of merger and asset contribution audits  and independent appraisals of takeover bids within the meaning of the AMF General Regulation. As stated in its reports  FINEXSI conducted its work in accordance with ""the professional doctrine of the Compagnie Nationale des Commissaires aux Comptes” applicable to this assignment"". FINEXSI had access to a wide range of documentation and was able to interview all the management teams of the two companies involved in the merger. In accordance with applicable professional standards  FINEXSI has conducted a multicriteria analysis of the valuation of both ERYTECH and PHERECYDES  including asset values  market valuations at different periods and business plans and “Discounted Cash Flows” evaluations. The analysis of FINEXSI confirms the fairness of the proposed exchange parity for the merger.To challenge the merger exchange ratio  Akkadian privately appointed a consultant  Abergel. This consultant acknowledges that they only had limited information available  i.e. much less than the court-appointed appraiser. They raise a number of questions and make erroneous conclusions that can be attributed to this lack of information and certain misunderstandings.Akkadian and its consultant argue that ERYTECH is undervalued compared to Pherecydes in the merger agreement and that the exchange ratio is not valid. To support this  they point at:a) ERYTECH’s cash balance of €30M at the end of March 2023 (€38M at the end of 2022). They forget to mention that ERYTECH has outstanding loans (€10M at the end of 2022)  a significant amount of accounts payable (€5.1M at the end of 2022)  and an operational use of cash  which will significantly limit the amount of available cash  except if it can be used for value creating projects  which is the whole idea of the merger  to make sure that the remaining assets and cash can be used to create value instead of losing its value.b) Disparity between the market valuation of both companies.

The proposed investment in Opdenergy reinforces Antin's strong commitment to the energy transition sector and is consistent with Antin's recognition of Spain's net-zero ambition. With an intention to maintain Opdenergy's headquarters in Spain  Antin plans to work closely with the existing strong management team for the exciting opportunities ahead.Stéphane Ifker  Senior Partner at Antin  stated: ""We are very excited to have the opportunity to support Opdenergy in the next stage of its already successful growth story and help accelerate its important contribution to Spain's energy transition and the decarbonisation of its economy. Antin has a strong track record in driving growth at energy companies  with support from our team of energy specialists and their extensive in-depth experience in the sector. Opdenergy is very complementary with our other platforms and further demonstrates our commitment to energy transition in Europe and North America.""Francisco Cabeza  Partner at Antin  continued  ""The announced investment in Opdenergy reflects our assessment of the company's present and future value and our confidence in its potential for growth in Spain and abroad. We are honoured to continue in this journey alongside Opdenergy and its management team  in particular its CEO  Luis Cid Suárez.""Transaction rationaleOpdenergy is a well-established vertically-integrated independent renewable energy developer and producer  with a diversified portfolio both geographically and in terms of energy source. The Company has 904 MW in operation  951 MW under construction and pre-construction (as of March 31  2023) and demonstrated track record in the development of renewable energy projects  mainly in Spain  the United States  Chile  Italy and Mexico. Opdenergy revenue model relies fundamentally on long-term private purchase agreements (PPAs) with private entities (as of March 31  2023  70% of production is contracted with long term IG PPAs)  and merchant sales to electricity systems for the remainder.[1]For its part  Antin has proven experience in the energy sector as a long-term investor working with management to create sustainable long-term value  leaving management responsible for day-to-day business while supporting strategy and business plans through active board participation.Antin believes that renewable energy will play an increasingly important role in reducing carbon emissions and contributing towards net zero.

PEDFIC 1 was a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase III trial that evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of Bylvay in reducing pruritus and serum bile acids (sBAs) in children with PFIC  and PEDFIC 2 is a long-term  open-label Phase III extension trial. Patients with PFIC have impaired bile flow  or cholestasis  and the resulting bile build-up in liver cells causes liver disease and symptoms  such as intense itching  poor sleep  delayed growth  and diminished quality of life. The harmful impacts of the disease extend to parents and caregivers  as the 2022 multinational PICTURE trial revealed that PFIC negatively affects caregivers’ quality of life  relationships  and career prospects.About the Phase III ASSERT trialASSERT is a gold standard  prospective intervention trial with 32 sites across North America  Europe  Middle East  and Asia Pacific. The double-blind  randomized  placebo-controlled trial was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 120 µg /kg/day Bylvay for 24 weeks in relieving pruritus in patients with ALGS. Key secondary endpoints measure serum bile acid levels and safety and tolerability. The trial enrolled patients aged 0 to 17 years of age with a genetically confirmed diagnosis of ALGS. In the primary analysis  the trial met the primary endpoint showing statistically significant reduction in pruritus as measured by the PRUCISION Observer-Reported Outcome scratching score (0-4 point scale)  from baseline at month 6 (weeks 21 to 24)  compared to the placebo arm (p=0.002). Over 90% of patients were pruritus responders during the trial  as defined as at least a 1-point drop at any time point. The trial also met the key secondary endpoint showing a statistically significant reduction in serum bile acid concentration from baseline to the average of weeks 20 and 24 (compared to the placebo arm p=0.001). Statistically significant improvements in multiple sleep parameters were observed as early as week 1-4 compared to patients on placebo with continued improvement through week 24. In the trial  there were no patient discontinuations. Bylvay was well tolerated  with an overall adverse event incidence similar to placebo and a low incidence of drug-related diarrhea (11.4% vs. 5.9% placebo).About Bylvay® (odevixibat)Bylvay is a potent  once-daily  non-systemic IBATi that acts locally in the small intestine and has minimal systemic exposure. It is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of pruritus in patients three months of age and older with PFIC  where it has orphan exclusivity. Bylvay was first launched as a treatment option for patients with PFIC in the U.S. in 2021  where it is supported by a program designed to assist with access to treatment and patient support. Bylvay is also approved in the E.U. for the treatment of PFIC in patients aged six months or older. It has launched in over nine countries and has secured public reimbursement across several major markets including Germany  Italy  the U.K.  France and Belgium.View full E.U. prescribing information here: Bylvay  INN-odevixibat (europa.eu)View full U.S. prescribing information here: label (fda.gov)About the PBC trial: Evaluating pruritus and fatigue in patients with treatment-refractory primary biliary cholangitisSemi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with 20 patients (aged 28-68 years; 19 females) diagnosed with PBC  (mean 10.7 years since diagnosis) experiencing pruritus (mild [30%]  moderate [45%] or severe [25%])  using Institutional Review Board-approved materials. The PFSF 7a consists of 7 items that measure both the experience of fatigue and interference of fatigue on daily activities over the past 7 days using a Likert response scale. Patients were asked to evaluate the PBC WI NRS and PFSF 7a on ease of understanding of instructions and items  ease of use of scale/response options  and appropriateness of recall period to capture the patient experience. Interviews were conducted by experienced qualitative researchers  and audio recordings were transcribed and analyzed with coding software.About ElafibranorElafibranor is a novel  oral  once-daily  dual peroxisome activated receptor (PPAR) alpha/delta (α δ) agonist  currently under investigation as treatment for patients with PBC  a rare liver disease. In 2019  it was granted a Breakthrough Therapy designation by the FDA in adults with PBC who have an inadequate response to ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). Elafibranor has not received approval by regulatory authorities anywhere in the world.About IpsenIpsen is a global  mid-sized biopharmaceutical company focused on transformative medicines in Oncology  Rare Disease and Neuroscience.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance.

Moller-Maersk. OCI will provide ISCC certified biomethanol to power the maiden voyage of Maersk's first dual-fueled container ship  in a pioneering step towards the decarbonization of global shipping.OCI BeaumontThe journey demonstrates OCI's unique capacity to supply marine customers with end-to-end green methanol solutions in major global bunkering locations  and further supports green methanol as the leading choice today for decarbonizing the marine sector  which is responsible for 3% of global GHG emissions.The vessel leaves South Korea for its maiden voyage this summer  sailing along one of the world's busiest shipping routes to Northern Europe via the Suez Canal. OCI is obtaining the approvals and permits required to commercially bunker methanol in several ports  including Port of Rotterdam on the ship's voyage  positioning OCI as the first commercial bunker operator of methanol in these regions.Ready for marineThis voyage is an important milestone in the expansion of OCI's renewable and low-carbon fuels business  a key pillar of OCI's sustainable growth strategy. As the maritime industry navigates increased regulation to accelerate decarbonization  such as the FuelEU Maritime initiative  OCI anticipates incremental global demand for methanol at 4 million tons per year in the next five years  based on current orders from the marine sector.OCI is focused on being the last mile operator of choice at strategic bunkering ports  leveraging partnerships with relevant authorities  terminal infrastructure partners  and bunker barge operators. In February  OCI announced its project with Unibarge to retrofit the first methanol powered bunker barge  to be deployed at the Port of Rotterdam.Leading the way on hydrogen fuelsThrough its OCI HyFuels brand  OCI is the largest green methanol producer globally. It has led the development of green methanol application in vehicle fuels  now placing up to 200 000 tons per annum equivalent and is growing its suite of low-carbon and green methanol products  including biomethanol  e-methanol  recycled carbon fuel (RCF) methanol  renewable natural gas  ethanol and bio-MTBE.Ahmed El-Hoshy  CEO at OCI Global:""I'm delighted that we are partnering with Maersk to power the first ever green methanol voyage with OCI HyFuels green methanol. This marks another significant milestone in our global leadership in supplying and trading renewable and low carbon fuels to decarbonize energy-intensive industries. We also appreciate the collaboration and leadership of our partners at each of the ports to facilitate this journey. With the maritime industry facing increasing regulatory scrutiny  its decarbonization is urgent  and OCI is playing a crucial role in helping the sector meet its environmental goals through our existing methanol capabilities; helping us build our position in the marine and fuels markets to capitalize on the coming ammonia fuel demand.""Bashir Lebada  CEO of OCI Methanol/HyFuels:""We are excited about this new phase of our methanol business. Marine has been the main buzz around methanol for several years  so to secure the first real green sale and voyage is testament to our team's hard work and further reinforces OCI HyFuels as the only large-scale green methanol solution for road and bunker. We welcome our partnership with Maersk and their leadership in decarbonizing the maritime sector; their early focus on methanol and conviction to order vessels has led us to where we are today. This also highlights our distribution system and last mile capabilities where we will continue to leverage our road fuel logistics and fuel blending system  and add to our green bunker barge fleet as demand grows.""Emma Mazhari  Head of Energy Markets at A.P.
