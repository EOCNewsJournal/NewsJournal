It represents a huge break from the current siloed landscape  in which ‘walled gardens’ of private or public networks make it highly difficult for different DLT platforms to interconnect.As part of its initiative  R3  in partnership with Adhara  has also launched a Hyperledger Foundation Lab - Harmonia - to speed the development of interoperability protocols for regulated financial institutions.R3 says that Harmonia will address the constraints and requirements of regulated financial networks to achieve true atomic settlement across blockchain networks. It was informed by HQLAX and Fnality  which demonstrated the world’s first proof of concept trustless atomic DvP (Delivery versus Payment) repo settlement between Corda and Hyperledger Besu.Corda is already deployed by hundreds of institutions operating at scale in global regulated markets  including DTCC  Euroclear  the Central Bank of UAE  SIX Digital Exchange (SDX)  andSpunta Banca DLT.R3 co-founder and chief strategy officer  Todd McDonald  says: “We believe this economy will be built upon an interconnected ecosystem of multiple DLT platforms  where apps will transact seamlessly and securely across networks - not isolated or walled gardens of ‘public’ or ‘private’ networks. We are already seeing demand for Corda’s enhanced capabilities from central banks exploring CBDCs for cross-border payments and wholesale settlement.”,neutral,0.05,0.95,0.0,negative,0.0,0.01,0.99,True,English,"['R3 bids', 'DLT interoperability', 'Distributed ledger technology services firm', 'global financial market infrastructure providers', 'other open enterprise DLT networks', 'Deutsche Börse Group', 'concept trustless atomic DvP', 'global regulated markets', 'different DLT platforms', 'multiple DLT platforms', 'regulated financial networks', 'true atomic settlement', 'other blockchain networks', 'current siloed landscape', 'SIX Digital Exchange', 'chief strategy officer', 'regulated financial institutions', 'Payment) repo settlement', 'Hyperledger Foundation Lab', 'interbank payments ecosystem', 'Banca DLT', 'wholesale settlement', 'public networks', 'Hyperledger Besu', 'interconnected ecosystem', 'cross-border payments', 'private’ networks', 'public beta', 'flagship product', 'updated version', 'central banks', 'BNP Paribas', 'Goldman Sachs', 'huge break', 'interoperability protocols', 'first proof', 'Todd McDonald', 'Canton Network', 'walled gardens', 'R3', 'Corda', 'applications', 'effort', 'transfer', 'assets', 'others', 'part', 'initiative', 'Adhara', 'Harmonia', 'development', 'constraints', 'requirements', 'HQLAX', 'Fnality', 'world', 'Delivery', 'hundreds', 'scale', 'DTCC', 'Euroclear', 'UAE', 'SDX', 'founder', 'economy', 'apps', 'demand', 'capabilities', 'CBDCs']",2023-06-14,2023-06-15,finextra.com

The review is based on positive results from the pivotal Phase III NAPOLI 3 trial  in which the Onivyde regimen demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS)  compared to nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine  with a safety profile consistent with the profiles of the treatment components. These results were presented at the January 2023 American Society of Clinical Oncology Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium (ASCO GI).“PDAC is a devastating disease in need of additional treatment options. The FDA’s decision to accept the sNDA for this Onivyde-based regimen in treatment-naïve patients with metastatic disease represents an important milestone in the potential treatment of this complex form of cancer ” said Howard Mayer  Executive Vice President and Head of Research and Development at Ipsen. “We’re committed to developing therapies which have the potential to make a meaningful difference to the lives of people living with cancer and look forward to working with FDA as they review this application.”The FDA provided a Prescription Drug User Fee Act goal date of 13 February 2024 for review of Ipsen’s application. In 2020  the FDA granted Ipsen Fast Track designation for Onivyde as a first-line combination treatment for mPDAC. The FDA’s Fast Track program facilitates the development and expedites the review of medicines that treat serious conditions and have the potential to address an unmet medical need.NAPOLI 3 data  as presented at ASCO GI 2023Trial met its primary endpoint of OS  showing patients in the NALIRIFOX group had a statistically significant improvement in median OS of 11.1 months  versus 9.2 months in the nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine group (HR 0.83 [95% CI 0.70–0.99]; p=0.04). At 12 months  the OS rate for the NALIRIFOX group was 45.6%  and for the nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine group it was 39.5%. At 18 months  the OS rate was 26.2% for the NALIRIFOX group  and 19.3% for the nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine group. 1Trial met its secondary endpoint showing patients treated with NALIRIFOX had a statistically significant improvement in median PFS of 7.4 months versus 5.6 months for nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine (HR 0.69 [95% CI 0.58–0.83]; p=0.0001).

Bookmark not defined.- ENDS –About the NAPOLI 3 trialError! Bookmark not defined.NAPOLI 3 is a randomized  open-label Phase III trial of an investigational Onivyde treatment regimen (NALIRIFOX) in patients who have not previously received chemotherapy for mPDAC. NAPOLI 3 enrolled 770 patients across 205 trial site locations in 18 countries. Patients were randomized to receive Onivyde plus 5 fluorouracil/leucovorin and oxaliplatin (NALIRIFOX regimen; n=383) twice in a month (days 1 and 15 of 28-day cycle) compared to an injection of nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine (n=387) administered three times a month (days 1  8  15 of a 28-day cycle).About OnivydeOnivyde is a cancer medicine that blocks an enzyme called topoisomerase I  which is involved in copying cell DNA needed to make new cells. By blocking the enzyme  cancer cells are prevented from multiplying and eventually die. In Onivyde  irinotecan is enclosed in tiny fat particles called liposomes  which accumulate in the tumor and release slowly over time.Onivyde is currently approved in most major markets including the U.S.  the E.U. and Asia in combination with fluorouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin (LV) for the treatment of patients with mPDAC after disease progression following gemcitabine-based therapy. Onivyde is not indicated as a single agent for the treatment of patients with mPDAC.Ipsen has exclusive commercialization rights for the current and potential future indications for Onivyde in the U.S. Servier  an independent pharmaceutical company with an international presence in 150 countries  is responsible for the commercialization of Onivyde outside of the U.S. and Taiwan. PharmaEngine is a commercial stage oncology company headquartered in Taipei and is responsible for the commercialization of Onivyde in Taiwan.About PDACPDAC is the most common type of cancer that forms in the pancreas with approximately 60 000 people diagnosed in the U.S. each year and nearly 500 000 people globally.2 3 Since there are no specific symptoms in the early stages  PDAC is often detected late and after the disease has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic or stage IV).4 Even in later stages  weight loss  abdominal pain and jaundice are the most common symptoms making PDAC difficult to detect.5 Despite significant advances in cancer treatments since the 1970s  no treatment options for PDAC significantly extend life.4 Currently  fewer than 20% of people diagnosed with PDAC survive longer than one year and  overall  pancreatic cancer has the lowest five-year survival rate of all cancer types globally and in the U.S.2 3U.S. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONBOXED WARNINGS: SEVERE NEUTROPENIA and SEVERE DIARRHEAFatal neutropenic sepsis occurred in 0.8% of patients receiving Onivyde. Severe or life-threatening neutropenic fever or sepsis occurred in 3% and severe or life-threatening neutropenia occurred in 20% of patients receiving Onivyde in combination with 5-FU and LV. Withhold Onivyde for absolute neutrophil count below 1500/mm3 or neutropenic fever. Monitor blood cell counts periodically during treatment.Severe diarrhea occurred in 13% of patients receiving Onivyde in combination with 5-FU/LV.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law.

Located in Abu Dhabi  this state of the art Reverse Osmosis Desalination (M2 RO) will be the third-largest desalination plant in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). With a production capacity of 550 000 cubic meters per day of potable water  it will provide clean drinking water to approximately 210 000 households while offering increased efficiency and a reduced environmental footprint. The contract represents revenue of approximately 300 million euros for Veolia. Project construction will begin in Q2 2023 so the plant can be commissioned by 2025.Most of the drinking water used in the UAE comes from the sea. To manage the growth in water consumption and to compensate for the aging of existing facilities  mainly thermal desalination plants  the country has decided to use the latest advanced technologies and engineering processes to increase its desalination capacity while reducing its energy consumption. A strategy that strongly supports the country's 2050 carbon neutrality ambition.Relying on Veolia's worldwide expertise in water desalination  the Mirfa 2 plant will follow the latest developments in environmental and efficiency standards for desalination  featuring advanced technological processes such as reverse osmosis  which represents strong efficiency gains compared to traditional thermal desalination  to lower energy consumption and improve productivity. These technological advancements allow to slash energy use by 80% compared to the 1980s  when thermal desalination was predominant.""Growing desalination capacities in a sustainable way is crucial  as they are a part of the mix of solutions needed to address water scarcity across the globe  and especially in the Middle East. With Mirfa 2 Reverse Osmosis  Veolia continues to raise the bar for environmental and operational standards in desalination  further contributing to the ecological transformation of the sector  which has already made significant progress over the years ""said Estelle Brachlianoff  Chief Executive Officer of Veolia. ""This project follows the successful commissioning of four other flagship desalination plants in the past 18 months to bring drinking water to more than six million people in Saudi Arabia  Umm Al Quwain (UAE)  Bahrain and Iraq. This achievement confirms our leading position in water technologies and our commitment to leveraging our expertise and our capacity for innovation to deliver reliable  affordable and sustainable water access solutions.""Desalination by reverse osmosis  which is based on membrane filtration  is the most widespread technological solution in countries that use desalination to combat water stress  as it reduces their energy consumption. Since the 1970s  SIDEM  a Veolia subsidiary specialized in desalination operations  has acquired unparalleled experience in this field and has become the world leader  with nearly eight million cubic meters of desalinated water per day.About VeoliaVeolia Group aims to become the benchmark company for ecological transformation. Present on five continents with nearly 220 000 employees  the Group designs and deploys useful  practical solutions for the management of water  waste and energy that are contributing to a radical turnaround of the current situation.

Agreement with senior lenders The Company signed an agreement with its senior lenders on 13 June 2023 regarding the extension of its existing senior financing arrangements. This agreement was made necessary due to the Company's anticipated inability to make the forthcoming scheduled payments to its senior lenders and will give the Company visibility on its short-termfinancial position. 6. Interim Financing SoftBank is providing Balyo with interim financing up to the sum of EUR 5 000 000 to allow Balyo to meet its on-going working capital requirements (""Financing""). The Financing will be provided in a number of installments and by way of convertible bonds issued by Balyo to SoftBank  due on 3/531 October 2024  which will accrue interest at a rate per annum equal to the higher of (i) 10%  or (ii) the sum of 10% and the Euro secured overnight financing rate. The amount drawn down by Balyo under the Financing is convertible at SoftBank's election  at the following price: (i) if the conversion is on or after the filing of the Offer but before the earlier of the Offer closing and the termination of the Offer (meaning the Tender Offer Agreement being terminated in accordance with its terms for any reason whatsoever)  at the Offer price per share; if the conversion is on or after the earlier of the Offer closing and the termination of the Offer and Balyo's shares are still listed on Euronext Paris  at the lower of (A) the Offer price  and (B) a 20% discount to Balyo's share price at the date of the conversion notice  based on the last thirty(30) day VWAP; and (iii) if the conversion is on or after the earlier of the Offer closing and the termination of the Offer and Balyo's shares have ceased to listed on Euronext Paris following successful completion of a mandatory squeeze-out on the remaining outstanding shares of Balyo  at the lower of (A) the Offer price per share  and (B) a 20% discount to the fair market value ofBalyo's shares. Depending on whether the bonds are converted (as the case may be) with or without such 20% discount  the new shares resulting from a full conversion of the bonds into equity will represent from 14.7% to 17.7% of Balyo's share capital.2 Upon termination of the Offer (as the case may be)  the Financing will remain in place but the amount available to Balyo shall be reduced to EUR 3 000 000 less any amounts that have previously been drawn3. Advisors Raine Group and Alantra are acting as financial advisor and Morrison Foerster and Bredin Prat as legal advisor to SoftBank. TAP Securities Ltd is acting as financial advisor of Balyo and Ashurst is acting as legal advisor of Balyo. *** For illustrative purposes  this means that a shareholder who owned 1% of Balyo's share capital before the capital increase would own from 0.85% to 0.82% of Balyo's share capital following completion of such capital increase. This calculation is based on conversion either: (i) at the offer price; or (ii) at a 20% discount to fair market value (assumed to be €0.85)  and assumes that the maximum amount of principal(€5 000 000) is drawn under the financing at the point of conversion. In the event that  in accordance with the provisions set out above  the bonds convert at a lower price per share (and/or discount thereto)  the dilutive effect of the conversion may be outside this range.

As a result  deliveries of new 3D printers  as well as sales of materials associated with these new printers  have been revised downwards for 2023.The level of printer orders has also been penalized by the concentration of sales efforts on key accounts. This refocusing enables Prodways to target larger industrial projects in terms of number of printers and consumption of 3D materials  but with longer sales processes  closer to long-term partnership projects than unit by unit transactions. In this respect  performance trials are underway with major players in the medical sector  with a potential of several dozen MovingLight® printers. In the event of further commercial success  these potential orders could fuel revenue growth in 2024.Given our operating leverage  the downward revision of the revenue guidance mechanically lowers the guidance for current EBITDA margin in 2023. Profitability in 2023 is also impacted by the strengthening of Prodways' teams in order to achieve its 5-year development plan.As a reminder  Prodways Group launched its BOOST development plan this year  with the ambition of achieving revenues of €200 million by 2028  with a current EBITDA margin strictly above 15%. The main challenge for 2023 is to lay the foundations for double-digit organic growth in subsequent years  in particular by strengthening our teams. As a matter of facts  some recruitments have been made ahead of schedule  enabling new team members to be integrated into the development plan more quickly  but generating additional costs in 2023. Some thirty new hires have already been made since the beginning of the year  including several divisional sales managers whose mission is to better promote the quality of Prodways' technologies and engineering teams  to a wider target of customers.Upcoming financial events: Prodways Group Annual General Meeting and distribution of Prodways Group shares held by Exail TechnologiesProdways Group's Annual General Meeting will be held on June 15  2023 at 10:00 a.m. at 19 boulevard des Italiens in Paris. On the same day  Exail Technologies  which owns 5.95% of the share capital of Prodways Group  will submit to the vote of its shareholders the distribution of all its Prodways Group shares in the form of an exceptional distribution in kind. This distribution will take place on June 23  2023 (payment date). This operation will slightly increase Prodways Group's free float  which will represent almost 65% of the capital (compared with 62% today).Next publications24 July 2023: activity of the second quarter 202320 September 2023 : half-year results 202316 October 2023: activity of the 3rd quarter 2023About Prodways GroupProdways Group is a specialist in industrial and professional 3D printing with a unique positioning as an integrated European player.

Together  these organizations executed on a vision to bring the benefits of VR to nursing education  going beyond the inherent limitations of real-life clinical practice students and nursing educators face today.Collaborating with VR-ready nursing schoolsNursing school testers for vrClinicals for Nursing included Villanova University  Indiana University  University of Rochester  University of Massachusetts Boston  University of Central Florida  University of Virginia  and more.“When bringing vrClinicals for Nursing to market  we aimed to focus on transition to practice – where we identified the challenges that learners face when beginning their professional practice as nurses ” said Michelle Moulton  DNP  RN  CHSE  CNE  Senior Manager for the Center for Innovation in Education Excellence at the National League for Nursing. “We see clinical judgment as an essential and core skill of nursing practice – a skill that has a steep hurdle to overcome for many new graduate nurses. VR offerings provide opportunities to rehearse clinical reasoning skills that reflect the complexity of patient care and reality of nursing practice.”Targeting unpreparedness to reduce dissatisfactionA recent study found that 55% of new nurses have made medical errors  as result of inexperience and rushing  to name a few reasons. Facing the pressures of practice without the skills to recover and build resilience is also creating a high dissatisfaction for young nursing professionals. In fact  nearly one-third (32.8%) of registered nurses left their job within the first year. With VR  nursing students can build and practice the skill sets needed  mimicking clinical practice decision-making in a busy hospital setting  prioritizing multiple patients and competing care demands. These new technologies also allow for scalability that was previously unattainable for nursing schools. An entire cohort of students can now run through multi-patient scenarios and receive feedback immediately after from their instructors.“Unlike any other simulation modality  VR provides students with a sense of immediacy and realism from being in the moment  because all of your senses are engaged ” said Julie Stegman  Vice President  Nursing Segment  Health Learning  Research & Practice at Wolters Kluwer  Health. “We know the transition from school into practice can be extremely difficult and it’s our responsibility to work with nurse educators to help students truly prepare for their real-life jobs. By better preparing nurses through their transition to practice  they can become more clinically confident – which allows for higher job satisfaction and better patient care.”vrClinicals not only helps nursing students build the key skills to transition from education to practice  but the solution is also built to help prepare students for the National Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX®) – which is the required adaptive test for nursing graduates to successfully pass to be licensed as a Registered Nurse. Starting this year  students taking the Next Generation NCLEX® exam  won’t just be tested on what they know  but how they think. The new test is now focused on evaluating the student’s ability to demonstrate the use of clinical judgment when responding to clinical questions  much like how they would need to think on the job.To see vrClinicals for Nursing in action  be sure to stop by our both #309 at the International Nursing Association for Clinical Simulation and Learning Conference (INACSL23)  June 14-17 in Providence  RI and to learn more  visit the vrClinicals for Nursing webpage  here.About Wolters KluwerWolters Kluwer (EURONEXT: WKL) is a global leader in information  software  and services for professionals in healthcare  tax and accounting  financial and corporate compliance  legal and regulatory  and corporate performance and ESG.

Finally  we note that the timing of the dissident’s campaign and the late nomination of its candidate also raise questions.”Commenting on the ISS recommendation  Bertrand Meunier  Chairman of Atos’ Board of Directors stated: “We appreciate ISS’ support and recommendation for shareholders to vote AGAINST all additional dissident draft resolutions at Atos’ 2023 AGM. The recommendation from ISS recognizes our continuously improving governance structure as well as our ongoing transformation plan  executed by a well-qualified management team and diverse Board of Directors. As we continue to deliver better-than-expected results  it is important that we maintain our solid momentum in order to fully unlock the value within our activities for the benefit of all stakeholders.”Atos’ Board of Directors encourages shareholders vote FOR all of their proposed resolutions to support the ongoing proven transformation (Resolutions 1 to 24) and to follow ISS’ recommendation and vote AGAINST Resolutions A  B  C and D proposed by three activist shareholders who wish to destabilize the Company.Shareholders of record on the second business day preceding the 2023 AGM  i.e. June 26  2023  at 00:00 a.m.  Paris time  are entitled to vote at the 2023 AGM.D.F.

The design of this machine benefits from over 20 years’ experience in production MBE systems running daily around the world and enabling outstanding process performances and stability  thus reducing their cost of ownership.Following the delivery of the first MBE 8000 platform and after a thorough qualification work carried out in close cooperation with IntelliEPI  the results obtained have exceeded the expectations for such technology  particularly in terms of uniformities  defect densities  increasing yield  and interface abruptness  which is key for superlattices structures to achieve high performance lasers.Those performances combined with a high level of run-to-run repeatability control in large-scale production will enable new generation lasers  in particular for the fast-growing VCSEL (vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser) technology with significant market opportunities in the field of smartphone under display facial recognition.In its latest report on VCSEL  Yole Group specified: a “major change expected is a shift in wavelength from 940 to 1 380nm (…)to achieve an integration of the VCSELs behind organic light emitting diode (OLED) displays  which are transparent at this wavelength. The first application could be the proximity sensor being placed under the display (…).” (source)On top of the VCSEL market  the precise control of the doping uniformity and the processes stability offered by the MBE 8000 platform will also enhance microelectronic device performances  such as conductivity.Over the past few months  as results were disclosed to several industrial customers  interest for this machine as grown quickly  leading to discussions for potential purchase.According to Yung-Chung Kao  IntelliEPI President and CEO  “From the initial evaluation so far  this Riber MBE 8000 has shown very impressive performance in terms of being able to produce high quality epi materials over such a large substrate platen area with excellent composition and thickness uniformity across the 8x6” platen.

The review is based on positive results from the pivotal Phase III NAPOLI 3 trial  in which the Onivyde regimen demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS)  compared to nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine  with a safety profile consistent with the profiles of the treatment components. These results were presented at the January 2023 American Society of Clinical Oncology Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium (ASCO GI).“PDAC is a devastating disease in need of additional treatment options. The FDA’s decision to accept the sNDA for this Onivyde-based regimen in treatment-naïve patients with metastatic disease represents an important milestone in the potential treatment of this complex form of cancer ” said Howard Mayer  Executive Vice President and Head of Research and Development at Ipsen. “We’re committed to developing therapies which have the potential to make a meaningful difference to the lives of people living with cancer and look forward to working with FDA as they review this application.”The FDA provided a Prescription Drug User Fee Act goal date of 13 February 2024 for review of Ipsen’s application. In 2020  the FDA granted Ipsen Fast Track designation for Onivyde as a first-line combination treatment for mPDAC. The FDA’s Fast Track program facilitates the development and expedites the review of medicines that treat serious conditions and have the potential to address an unmet medical need.NAPOLI 3 data  as presented at ASCO GI 2023Trial met its primary endpoint of OS  showing patients in the NALIRIFOX group had a statistically significant improvement in median OS of 11.1 months  versus 9.2 months in the nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine group (HR 0.83 [95% CI 0.70–0.99]; p=0.04). At 12 months  the OS rate for the NALIRIFOX group was 45.6%  and for the nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine group it was 39.5%. At 18 months  the OS rate was 26.2% for the NALIRIFOX group  and 19.3% for the nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine group. 1Trial met its secondary endpoint showing patients treated with NALIRIFOX had a statistically significant improvement in median PFS of 7.4 months versus 5.6 months for nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine (HR 0.69 [95% CI 0.58–0.83]; p=0.0001). 1The objective response rate was 41.8% (36.8%-46.9%; 95% CI) for patients treated with the NALIRIFOX regimen versus 36.2% (31.4%-41.2%; 95% CI) for patients treated with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine. 1The safety profile of NALIRIFOX was consistent with the profiles of the treatment components. The most common Grade 3/4 treatment-emergent adverse events with more than 10% frequency in patients receiving NALIRIFOX versus nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine included diarrhea (20.3% vs 4.5%)  nausea (11.9% vs 2.6%)  hypokalemia (15.1% vs 4.0%)  anemia (10.5% vs 17.4%) and neutropenia (14.1% vs 24.5%).1- ENDS –About the NAPOLI 3 trialError! Bookmark not defined.NAPOLI 3 is a randomized  open-label Phase III trial of an investigational Onivyde treatment regimen (NALIRIFOX) in patients who have not previously received chemotherapy for mPDAC. NAPOLI 3 enrolled 770 patients across 205 trial site locations in 18 countries. Patients were randomized to receive Onivyde plus 5 fluorouracil/leucovorin and oxaliplatin (NALIRIFOX regimen; n=383) twice in a month (days 1 and 15 of 28-day cycle) compared to an injection of nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine (n=387) administered three times a month (days 1  8  15 of a 28-day cycle).About OnivydeOnivyde is a cancer medicine that blocks an enzyme called topoisomerase I  which is involved in copying cell DNA needed to make new cells. By blocking the enzyme  cancer cells are prevented from multiplying and eventually die. In Onivyde  irinotecan is enclosed in tiny fat particles called liposomes  which accumulate in the tumor and release slowly over time.Onivyde is currently approved in most major markets including the U.S.  the E.U. and Asia in combination with fluorouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin (LV) for the treatment of patients with mPDAC after disease progression following gemcitabine-based therapy. Onivyde is not indicated as a single agent for the treatment of patients with mPDAC.Ipsen has exclusive commercialization rights for the current and potential future indications for Onivyde in the U.S. Servier  an independent pharmaceutical company with an international presence in 150 countries  is responsible for the commercialization of Onivyde outside of the U.S. and Taiwan. PharmaEngine is a commercial stage oncology company headquartered in Taipei and is responsible for the commercialization of Onivyde in Taiwan.About PDACPDAC is the most common type of cancer that forms in the pancreas with approximately 60 000 people diagnosed in the U.S. each year and nearly 500 000 people globally.2 3 Since there are no specific symptoms in the early stages  PDAC is often detected late and after the disease has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic or stage IV).4 Even in later stages  weight loss  abdominal pain and jaundice are the most common symptoms making PDAC difficult to detect.5 Despite significant advances in cancer treatments since the 1970s  no treatment options for PDAC significantly extend life.4 Currently  fewer than 20% of people diagnosed with PDAC survive longer than one year and  overall  pancreatic cancer has the lowest five-year survival rate of all cancer types globally and in the U.S.2 3U.S. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONBOXED WARNINGS: SEVERE NEUTROPENIA and SEVERE DIARRHEAFatal neutropenic sepsis occurred in 0.8% of patients receiving Onivyde. Severe or life-threatening neutropenic fever or sepsis occurred in 3% and severe or life-threatening neutropenia occurred in 20% of patients receiving Onivyde in combination with 5-FU and LV.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions.

These preliminary results suggest an effect of Batten-1 on neuronal death and initial signs of clinical efficacy.Theranexus and BBDF are conducting a Phase I/II trial of their drug candidate in six patients with Batten disease (CLN3) aged 17 years and over who are due to receive treatment over a 24-month period. The first results of this Phase I/II trial after 9 weeks of treatment showed a good tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile[1] for Batten-1. The new preliminary results  achieved after 6 months of treatment  show an average 17% decline in neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels in the blood of dosed patients. Neurofilaments are a recognized biomarker of neurodegeneration[2]. Moreover  motor symptoms assessed by the modified physical subscale of the disease- specific UBDRS[3] did not progress over the same period (mean score of 31.8 after 6 months of treatment as against 32.4 at baseline)  whereas according to data available describing the natural course of the disease  this clinical score should have progressed[4] by around one point in these patients. Lastly  the drug candidate continues to show a good tolerability profile after six months of treatment.For Theranexus' CEO Mathieu Charvériat  ""In our Phase I/II trial on Batten-1 in patients aged 17 and over and unfortunately at a rather advanced stage of the disease  we measure the levels of neurofilaments NfL and motor symptoms via the modified UBDRS  which provide data indicative of Batten-1's efficacy. Today we present our initial six-month results  which confirm the strong therapeutic potential of Batten-1 in Batten disease owing to its ability to reduce neuronal death and consequently the progression of the disease"".In conclusion  Theranexus' Chief Medical Officer Marie Sebille added: «These preliminary results are very promising for this devastating disease for which there is currently no treatment. They reveal a convergence of positive signals with the reduction of neurofilaments and stabilization of motor symptoms after six months of treatment. This offers a great hope for children affected by this disease and their families"".The preliminary six-month results will be presented to the scientific and medical community at NCL2023  the 18th International Congress on Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinoses to be held in Hamburg  Germany from 26 to 30 September 2023.About Batten-1Batten-1 is a novel and exclusive proprietary drug containing the active ingredient miglustat. The mechanism of action of this substance blocks the accumulation of glycosphingolipids and neuroinflammation  thus significantly reducing neuronal death that contributes to a progressive loss of function in patients. For patients over 17 years of age in the Phase I/II trial  the product is administered in solid form. In the Phase III trial  it will be administered in a liquid form better suited to pediatric patients.Phase I/II trial design: this is an open-label trial involving 6 patients over 17 years of age with CLN3 Batten disease  treated with miglustat up to 600 mg/day for a 2-year period. The primary endpoint is patient safety and tolerability  assessed using reports of adverse effects  biological tests and ECG  as well as the pharmacokinetics of miglustat. The secondary endpoints include efficacy monitoring: Unified Batten Disease Rating Scale  visual acuity  measurement of brain volumes by MRI and measurement of the thickness of the neuronal layer of the retina by optical coherence tomography scans. Administration of Batten-1 in escalating doses with a maximum of 600 mg/day was well tolerated  with no severe side effects observed causing treatment discontinuation. The most commonly reported adverse events are reversible gastrointestinal effects of often light to moderate severity  thus demonstrating the good tolerability profile of Batten-1 in this population. Batten-1 will continue to be assessed in these patients treated over a 24-month period. Further information about the trial is available on https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/showithNCT05174039.About Batten diseaseJuvenile Batten disease  also known as Spielmeyer-Vogt or CLN3 disease  is a rare  fatal  inherited disorder of the nervous system for which there is no treatment or cure. Juvenile Batten disease belongs to a group of disorders referred to as neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs). Over 400 different errors in 13 genes have been attributed to various forms of NCL  which differ from one another primarily by when symptoms first appear. The first symptom in the juvenile form  progressive vision loss  appears between the ages of 4 and 6 and is followed by cognitive disorders  behavioral disorders  and motor disorders. Seizures commonly appear within 2-4 years of the onset of disease. Over time  patients continue to decline mentally and physically. Eventually  those affected become wheelchair-bound  are bedridden  and die prematurely.Juvenile Batten disease is always fatal; usually by the late teens to early 20s. In the United States and Europe  the juvenile form is the most common of the NCLs  which together  affect nearly 2 000 patients[5]. In pathophysiological terms  interactions between neurons and glial cells play key roles in the emergence and progression of all the NCLs.About Beyond Batten Disease FoundationBeyond Batten Disease Foundation (BBDF) is the world's largest nonprofit organization dedicated to funding research for a treatment and cure for juvenile (CLN3) Batten disease. Since its inception in 2008  over $35 million has been invested in research by leveraging donations  co-funding and strategic partnerships. BBDF is spearheading a unique  cohesive strategy  incorporating independent scientific resources and collaboration with related organizations to drive research in juvenile Batten Disease[6]. Today there is a treatment in sight. BBDF funded research has discovered a drug – Batten-1 – that slows the progression of the disease in Batten models.
