The purchaser of the DMFCs is ZeroAlpha Solutions Ltd  a leading provider of communications  information management and sustainable energy solutions for defense and security customers  acting on behalf of NSPA and its partner nations.The framework contract of ZeroAlpha Solutions  signed in summer 2022  comprises a total value of approx. EUR 10 million and runs until the end of 2026. Within this period  NATO member states will be able to call off SFC fuel cell systems JENNY 600S  JENNY 1200 and EMILY 3000 as well as the Power Manager 3G via the NSPA platform. The British Ministry of Defence  along with other NATO Allies  has already made use of this and orders for SFC power generators have exceeded one million euros. In addition  the contract with ZeroAlpha includes a fixed quota of SFC power solutions to be called off annually.NSPA fulfills the procurement function for air-  land- and sea-based equipment and services  as well as for the cyber and space sectors  in accordance with the requirements of the NATO member states. These range from aircraft  helicopters and unmanned systems  to the provision of supplies such as fuel  spare parts and ammunition  to services such as radar maintenance and in the areas of infrastructure  transport and catering.The portable JENNY fuel cell series with a nominal power of up to 50 W and the mobile or stationary EMILY 3000 with a nominal power of 125 W produce environmentally friendly  stable  and almost heat-free electricity for electrical devices or charging batteries. The EMILY version can also provide onboard power for vehicles without the engine running. Further advantages compared to fossil power generators: both energy solutions use methanol sparingly  significantly reducing operating costs. Furthermore  both SFC power generators are extremely durable and thus ideally suited for field use.""The NSPA contract provides an easy access for new customers to our product offering. We thank our long term parter ZeroAlpha for this enhanced market access ” says Dr. Peter Podesser  CEO of SFC Energy AG.""The NSPA platform offers NATO member states safe  robust and field-proven equipment. The power generation solutions of the JENNY and EMILY series meet these requirements  which is why our choice for the DMFCs immediately fell on SFC Energy. We are happy to have SFC Energy as a reliable partner on our side in the years to come "" says Stewart Burton  CEO of ZeroAlpha Solutions Ltd.For more information on SFC Energy's Clean Energy and Clean Power Management solutions  visit sfc.com.About SFC Energy AGSFC Energy AG is a leading provider of hydrogen and methanol fuel cells for stationary and mobile hybrid power solutions.

EBITDA  equal to € 8.37 mil- lion  saw an increase of 18.7%  compared to € 7.05 million in the previous year. The EBITDA Margin  equal to 5.9%  was also higher than the previous year's figure of 5.3%. EBIT  after amortization and depreciation of € 0.01 million  came in at € 8.36 million (€ 6.89 million in FY21A). Finally  the NFP came in at a debt value of € 26.38 million  worsening compared to the previous year's value (€ 18.40 million of debt).Estimates UpdateIn light of the results published in the annual report for FY22A  and the recent acquisitions of PhoneTime Inc. and Matchcom Inc.  we have revised our estimates for both the current year and the coming years. In particular  we now estimate an FY23E value of production of € 310.00 million  and an EBITDA of € 15.60 million  corresponding to a margin of 5.0%. In the following years  we expect the value of production to rise to € 490.00 million (CAGR 22Y-27E: 28.3%) in FY27E  with EBITDA equal to € 37.90 million (corresponding to a margin of 7.7%)  up from € 8.37 million in FY22A (corresponding to an EBITDA Margin of 5.9%).Valuation UpdateWe conducted our valuation of the equity value of Mexedia based on the DCF method. The DCF method (including  for prudential purposes  a specific risk of 2.50% in the calculation of the WACC) returned an equity value of € 262.2 million.

These vehicles  which are currently built in France and converted to hydrogen in Germany  will be mass-produced from 2024  at the Hordain site in the north of France  which will have a production capacity of 5 000 hydrogen vehicles a year. As part of its strategic plan  DARE FORWARD 2030  Stellantis has announced its ambition to further develop its range of fuel cell commercial vehicles  which are particularly well-suited to high-mileage commercial users.In the fast-emerging hydrogen economy  hydrogen project initiators now need to simultaneously leverage all components of the value chain  i.e. hydrogen production  refuelling solution  vehicles  etc. This complexity can slow project progress. By joining the Lhyfe Heroes platform  Stellantis hopes to help customers to implement their hydrogen plans.The platform  which was created by Lhyfe – one of the world's pioneers in the production of green and renewable hydrogen for transport and industry – aims to support the efforts of both hydrogen project initiators and hydrogen solution providers. With thousands of visits a month since its launch in November 2022  the portal answers a strong demand from users for information on new hydrogen products and services.Lhyfe Heroes offers three main services  which are constantly being enriched. In a few minutes  users can: assess the relevance of using hydrogen for decarbonising their operations thanks to a simulator with an integrated calculation system identify market-available products and solutions to implement their plans (over a hundred such products and services are already listed on Lhyfe Heroes) connect with hydrogen vehicle manufacturers  refuelling stations  hydrogen generator suppliers and hydrogen producers.Through its partnership with Lhyfe Heroes  Stellantis now catalogues online its various vehicles with their characteristics and key data. With just a few clicks  visitors seeking a fleet of commercial hydrogen vehicles can easily access comprehensive information on various models of vans available. They can also refine their search criteria to find the most suitable options. The data collected from the portal's usage will help Stellantis better understand customer needs.Peter Kuhn  in charge of hydrogen development at Stellantis (Citroën  Peugeot and Opel) said: “To accelerate the spread of our range of light commercial vehicles for professionals and the development of hydrogen ecosystems  we need all of the chain to develop simultaneously.

EURONEXT)  the world leader in particle accelerator technology and the world’s leading provider of proton therapy solutions for the treatment of cancer  and PARTICLE (Particle Therapy Interuniversity Center Leuven)  located on the health sciences campus of the University Hospitals Leuven (UZ Leuven)  today announced they have initiated a Research Partnership for the development of ConformalFLASH®1.As part of the collaboration  IBA will enable the FLASH configuration in the clinical proton therapy system of PARTICLE to facilitate preclinical research on FLASH therapy. Researchers from UZ Leuven  KU Leuven and UCLouvain will perform preclinical experiments to evaluate the FLASH effect on normal tissue toxicity using IBA’s Proteus®ONE2. In the future  this could lead to new clinical functionality for patients.This is the first FLASH research project to be carried out with a superconducting synchrocyclotron  such as IBA’s Proteus®ONE in a clinical setting. FLASH therapy aims to deliver treatment at an ultra-high dose rate (> 40 Gy/s) in one to five fractions. This is compared to conventional beam treatments that are delivered at much lower dose rate and typically spread out over an average of 25 to 30 sessions. This delivery at ultra-high dose rate might lead to a reduced toxicity and sparing effect on the normal tissues while offering similar tumor control to conventional treatment3.FLASH therapy can potentially deliver a paradigm shift in radiation therapy and cancer treatment  as demonstrated by a growing body of preclinical evidence4-5. The collaboration between IBA and PARTICLE is another successful step in bringing FLASH therapy to patients in the clinic. It builds on the long-standing cooperation between the two partners  initiated in 2017.Olivier Legrain  Chief Executive Officer of IBA  commented: “ConfomalFLASH® therapy has the potential to further improve radiotherapy for patients worldwide. IBA is committed to shaping the future of proton therapy together with its partners and user community. Building on its industry-leading efforts in FLASH research  we are excited to partner with PARTICLE  as our 1st Proteus®ONE research partner  to further increase our understanding of FLASH and move it closer toward clinical implementation.”“At PARTICLE we invest in further improving the radiation treatment delivery to the benefit of our patients. Through this preclinical research  we hope to learn more about how FLASH therapy could provide faster  simpler and more effective cancer treatment”  said prof. Edmond Sterpin  Research professor KU Leuven & UCLouvain.***ENDS***About IBAIBA (Ion Beam Applications S.A.) is the world leader in particle accelerator technology.

Tumor-associated macrophages are key components of the tumor microenvironment and have emerged as a promising avenue for discovery of novel cancer immunotherapies. CSF-1R kinase inhibition is therefore a promising therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment.Graham Dixon  Chief Scientific Officer of Mithra  commented: “We are encouraged that the lead CSF-1R inhibitor demonstrated efficacy as a single agent in 3 different preclinical cancer models and that the data suggest it may be synergistic when used in combination with PD-1 inhibitors. This provides a strong rationale supporting further development of CSF-1R inhibitors in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors. We look forward to further evaluating and advancing these promising small molecule therapeutic candidates.”A first study  conducted in a widely used preclinical immune-oncology model  demonstrated that the lead compound  as well as several backups  showed anti-tumor activity as a single agent. The well tolerated compounds demonstrated pronounced and consistent modulation of the tumor microenvironment  including an increase of T cells  which mediate anti-tumor immune responses  and infiltration of natural killer (NK) cells  containing enzymes that can kill tumor cells  into the tumors. Data showed a decrease in tumor-infiltrating macrophages  a type of white blood cell that plays an important role in the human immune system  and repolarization of the tumor-supportive M2 macrophage to the tumor-suppressive M1 macrophage. These results are consistent with anti-tumor activity  and tumor growth inhibition of up to 59%.The efficacy of the lead compound was further assessed as a single agent or in combination with anti PD1 therapeutic antibody in additional preclinical studies using three different cancer models: MC38 (colorectal)  4T1 (orthotopic triple negative breast) and EMT6 (triple negative breast).The significant anti-tumor activity of the lead compound used as a single agent was confirmed and was further enhanced with twice daily administration  compared to once daily. Additivity or synergy on tumor growth inhibition was observed when the lead compound was used in combination with anti-PD1 therapy; the triple negative breast cancer model showed that 50% of the animals achieved a complete tumor regression after the combination treatment. Further data will be presented in a peer-reviewed setting.The research was conducted under a partnership with BCI Pharma  first announced in November 2021. Mithra’s primary focus is on endometriosis and cancers affecting women  including orphan indications such as triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Under the terms of the agreement  Mithra has an option to acquire from BCI all rights  title and interest in the series of CSF-1R inhibitors  and part of the BCI rights  title and interest in and to the results of the research and related intellectual property.For more information  please contact:Mithra Pharmaceuticals SADavid Horn SolomonChief Executive Officerinvestorrelations@mithra.com Investor & media relationsChris MaggosCohesion Bureauchris.maggos@cohesionbureau.com+41 79 367 6254About MithraMithra Pharmaceuticals SA (Euronext: MITRA) is a Belgian biopharmaceutical company dedicated to transforming Women’s Health by offering new choices through innovation  with a particular focus on contraception and menopause.

EURONEXT)  the world leader in particle accelerator technology and the world’s leading provider of proton therapy solutions for the treatment of cancer  and PARTICLE (Particle Therapy Interuniversity Center Leuven)  located on the health sciences campus of the University Hospitals Leuven (UZ Leuven)  today announced they have initiated a Research Partnership for the development of ConformalFLASH®1.As part of the collaboration  IBA will enable the FLASH configuration in the clinical proton therapy system of PARTICLE to facilitate preclinical research on FLASH therapy. Researchers from UZ Leuven  KU Leuven and UCLouvain will perform preclinical experiments to evaluate the FLASH effect on normal tissue toxicity using IBA’s Proteus®ONE2. In the future  this could lead to new clinical functionality for patients.This is the first FLASH research project to be carried out with a superconducting synchrocyclotron  such as IBA’s Proteus®ONE in a clinical setting. FLASH therapy aims to deliver treatment at an ultra-high dose rate (> 40 Gy/s) in one to five fractions. This is compared to conventional beam treatments that are delivered at much lower dose rate and typically spread out over an average of 25 to 30 sessions. This delivery at ultra-high dose rate might lead to a reduced toxicity and sparing effect on the normal tissues while offering similar tumor control to conventional treatment3.FLASH therapy can potentially deliver a paradigm shift in radiation therapy and cancer treatment  as demonstrated by a growing body of preclinical evidence4-5. The collaboration between IBA and PARTICLE is another successful step in bringing FLASH therapy to patients in the clinic. It builds on the long-standing cooperation between the two partners  initiated in 2017.Olivier Legrain  Chief Executive Officer of IBA  commented: “ConfomalFLASH® therapy has the potential to further improve radiotherapy for patients worldwide. IBA is committed to shaping the future of proton therapy together with its partners and user community. Building on its industry-leading efforts in FLASH research  we are excited to partner with PARTICLE  as our 1st Proteus®ONE research partner  to further increase our understanding of FLASH and move it closer toward clinical implementation.”“At PARTICLE we invest in further improving the radiation treatment delivery to the benefit of our patients. Through this preclinical research  we hope to learn more about how FLASH therapy could provide faster  simpler and more effective cancer treatment”  said prof. Edmond Sterpin  Research professor KU Leuven & UCLouvain.***ENDS***About IBAIBA (Ion Beam Applications S.A.) is the world leader in particle accelerator technology.

The plan projects to reduce operating expenses by an annualized EUR 18 million  and is expected to lead to break-even EBITDA by the end of 2024. The Company plans to focus its investments on profitable revenue generation and strategic partnerships that are expected to drive sustainable growth and shareholder value. The plan aims at creating a self-sustaining business as a basis for a recapitalization that would secure the Company’s remaining funding needs and enable value appreciation for all stakeholders.This planned reorganization enables a shift towards profitability through an increased focus on partner funded test menu expansion and a more targeted US commercial strategy to increase oncology test utilization.Commenting on the planned reorganization  Roger Moody  Chief Executive Officer of Biocartis  said: “This reorganization is the first step necessary to create a clear path to financial independence by focusing on near-term growth from our existing business and delivering on our strategic partnership agreements that provide long-term value. I am confident that the streamlined organization will be able to continue to build on the strengths of our fully automated molecular platform with its unmatched ease-of-use  turn-around-time and sample versatility in oncology. We are fortunate to have and we fully support our trusted partnerships that include objectives to expand the number of tests that deliver fast and accurate results to cancer patients with currently unmet needs. Turning to our next steps  I look forward to working with our investors to secure the funds needed to achieve break-even EBITDA and recapitalize the balance sheet to clear the way for meaningful shareholder value creation.”The reorganization includes the intention to reduce employment globally by approximately 140 positions (approximately 25% of the workforce)  and includes a number of people employed in Biocartis’ Belgian entities which triggers the application of the Belgian rules on collective dismissals. Consequently  a declaration of intent of the collective dismissal has been filed today in accordance with the Belgian rules on collective dismissals.The Company has engaged in constructive dialogue with key creditors and is planning to engage an international investment bank to assist in the development of a strategy and implementation of a recapitalization of the Company.As part of the reorganization Piet Houwen  the Company’s Chief Operating Officer  has submitted his resignation effective 1 September 2023.As a result of the uncertainty related to the operational reorganization  the Company withdraws its 2023 outlook at least until the publication of its financial results for H1 2023 on 31 August 2023.--- END ---More information:Corporate Communications & Investor Relations Biocartise-mail ir@biocartis.comtel +32 15 632 600@Biocartis_ www.linkedin.com/BiocartisAbout BiocartisBiocartis (Euronext Brussels: BCART) is an innovative molecular diagnostics (MDx) company providing next generation diagnostic solutions aimed at improving clinical practice for the benefit of patients  clinicians  payers and industry.

26250,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://observer.com/2023/06/bernard-arnault-net-worth-changes/,Billionaire Bernard Arnault’s Net Worth Has Had Its Ups and Downs,The luxury tycoon first broke the billion-dollar mark in 1997.,In the past few months  Bernard Arnault’s fortune has surpassed those of technology billionaires with long-standing spots at the top of global billionaire lists.Headlines swirled when Elon Musk lost his spot as the world’s richest person in December to Arnault  the French head of conglomerate LVMH (LVMHF)  which oversees a slew of name-brand luxury companies like Louis Vuitton and Tiffany & Co. The race between the two billionaires has been a close one in recent weeks as the duo have taken turns topping each other’s net worth  with both Musk and Arnault currently holding more than $200 billion each.The road to a nine-figure net worth for Arnault  75  has been a long and tumultuous journey. Starting out in the luxury world shortly after completing an engineering degree  he eventually took control of LVMH as chairman and CEO  a position he’s held for 34 years. His wealth is largely tied to a 97.5 stake in Christian Dior  the leading holding company of LVMH  which controls more than 40 percent of the conglomerate.Here are some of the most notable dips and rises in what is currently one of the largest fortunes in global history.1997: An initial ranking at $3.6 billionArnault’s inaugural appearance on the annual Forbes billionaire list first occurred in 1997  eight years after he took control of LVMH. At the time  he was reported to have an estimated fortune of $3.6 billion.His first luxury acquisition occurred in 1984  when Arnault took advantage of the bankruptcy of Christian Dior’s parent company Boussac to purchase the fashion brand for $15 million. As Arnault sold off most of Christian Dior in the next five years  he also began buying shares in LVMH  the recent result of a merger between Louis Vuitton and Moet Hennessy.Arnault became the chairman and CEO in 1989 after increasing his stake to take control  and his growing luxury conglomerate reached $6 billion in revenue by 1997.2005: A $20 billion milestoneA significant rise in LVMH’s net income by 2005  an increase of 80 percent compared to 2002  helped Arnault’s personal fortune surpass $20 billion for the first time.Nearly tripling his 2003 net worth of $6.7 billion  the luxury conglomerate head benefited from LVMH’s steadily growing appeal throughout Asia. Excluding Japan  Asian customers accounted for 18 percent of LVMH sales by mid-2005  compared to 15 percent in 2004.2012: Arnault holds steady around $41 billionIn 2010  2011 and 2012  the French businessman was given the same estimated fortune of $41 billion by Forbes. In 2012  he was the fourth richest person in the world and the wealthiest in France.Arnault’s fortune benefited from LVMH’s 22 percent increase in profits over 2012 and its successful integration of newly acquired brands like Bulgari.But his less successful companies  like supermarket chain Carrefour  which dropped by $1 billion in value  prevented Arnault from rising more quickly on the list.2013: Why the drop to $29 billion?Despite his fortune holding steady over the previous three years  Arnault saw a dramatic dip in 2013 when his net worth fell to $29 billion.The downturn also dropped Arnault from the world’s fourth richest person to its tenth. While LVMH shares didn’t suffer that year  instead increasing by six percent  the luxury tycoon’s decreased net worth was attributed to “new information on his ownership stake” and a “revised valuation method ” according to Forbes India.At the time  Arnault was also facing public backlash over his application for Belgian citizenship  which some criticized as an attempt to avoid France’s tax policies. Although he denied the claims  Arnault later withdrew his bid.2018: $72 billion during a record-breaking yearAfter four years with an estimated net worth that fluctuated between $33.5 million and $41.5 million  Arnault’s luck changed in 2018. With $72 million  he jumped seven places on the Forbes ranking to become the world’s fourth richest person and reclaimed his title as Europe’s wealthiest person  a position he lost after 2012.The rise was largely attached to a record-breaking year for LVMH. At the time its largest-ever revenue  the luxury company brought in $53.4 billion in 2018  a nine percent increase from the year prior.Once again  Asian demand benefitted Arnault. Chinese consumers increased their spending on LVMH products by double digits in the fourth quarter of the year  in part due to regional price cuts led by Louis Vuitton after import tariffs on clothing were slashed by more than half.2019: Takeovers ramp up as Arnault becomes a centi-billionaireArnault joined Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos in the $100 billion club in 2019  the first non-tech tycoon to do so  after LVMH shares reached a record high on the Euronext Paris exchange.The luxury conglomerate’s brands became even more sought-after by the public throughout the year  with Arnault’s net worth reaching $107 million in July and temporarily surpassing that of Bill Gates  making him the second wealthiest person for a short time.By the end of 2019  LVMH’s stock price had risen by 54 percent. Arnault additionally announced his plans to purchase Tiffany & Co.by 2020  a $16 million purchase that would later become the largest acquisition in the company’s history.2021: $150 billion amid Covid shoppingAmid the Covid-19 pandemic in 2021  appetites for luxury shopping skyrocketed — and so did Arnault’s fortune. Ranked as the world’s third richest person by Forbes with $150 billion  his conglomerate saw its shares rise by 86 percent.By May 2021  Arnault briefly became the world’s richest person when he surpassed Jeff Bezos with a jump in net worth to $186 billion after LVMH stock traded at an all-time high. The first quarter of the year also saw his company bring in a 52 percent increase in revenue  compared to the same period in 2020.While Arnault fell back down to third place a few months later  the year marked his emergence as a contender for top billionaire.2022: Arnault begins his race to the top with $185 billionAlthough Arnault’s initial Forbes ranking in 2022 had him once again as the third richest person with $158 billion  his ascent picked up speed by December.While LVMH shares were up nearly 18 percent in the second half of 2022  Elon Musk  then ranked the world’s richest person  took a tumble when Tesla stock collapsed by nearly 57 percent throughout the year. As Musk’s net worth fell to $185.3 billion  Arnault temporarily became the richest tycoon with $185.4 billion  setting up a tight race between the two.Arnault surpassed Musk for good later in the month when his fortune rose to $188 billion compared to Musk’s $177 billion.2023: $225 billion  for nowStarting off the year with a bang  Arnault topped Forbes annual billionaires list in 2023 with record revenue and profit for LVMH and a net worth of $211 billion  making him the third person to surpass the $200 billion mark after Musk and Bezos.In April  LVMH also opened its revamped and long-awaited Tiffany flagship store in Manhattan  shortly before becoming the first European company to ever reach a $500 billion market valuation.But the French businessman’s luck turned around in May  when he lost $11 billion in a single day after LVMH shares fell by five percent. While he retained his position as the richest billionaire  concerns over lessening appetites for luxury products caused by a slow-down in the global economy spurred a sell-off of LVMH shares by investors.Arnault faced more challenges in June when his plans to build an exclusive luxury hotel in Beverly Hills were rejected by local voters concerned about potential overdevelopment. And earlier this month  after Tesla stock reached its highest level in 2023 thus far  Musk managed to reclaim his position as the world’s wealthiest person  with $220.2 billion compared to the LVMH head’s $216 billion.As of yesterday (June 14)  Musk remains ahead with $233.6 billion  while Arnault places second at $225.1 billion  according to Forbes. But if Arnault’s track record is any history  the battle for the top is far from over.,neutral,0.07,0.88,0.04,mixed,0.21,0.11,0.68,True,English,"['Billionaire Bernard Arnault', 'Net Worth', 'Ups', 'Downs', 'annual Forbes billionaire list', 'global billionaire lists', 'supermarket chain Carrefour', 'Euronext Paris exchange', 'regional price cuts', 'leading holding company', 'next five years', 'previous three years', 'first non-tech tycoon', 'fourth richest person', 'first luxury acquisition', 'name-brand luxury companies', 'same estimated fortune', 'nine-figure net worth', 'growing luxury conglomerate', 'nine percent increase', 'luxury tycoon', 'fourth quarter', 'luxury company', 'wealthiest person', 'global history', 'growing appeal', 'successful companies', 'stock price', 'parent company', '2003 net worth', 'Forbes India', 'four years', 'Forbes ranking', 'net income', 'first time', 'technology billionaires', 'long-standing spots', 'French head', 'Louis Vuitton', 'two billionaires', 'recent weeks', 'tumultuous journey', 'engineering degree', 'Christian Dior', 'notable dips', 'initial ranking', 'inaugural appearance', 'fashion brand', 'recent result', 'Moet Hennessy', '$20 billion milestone', 'Asian customers', 'French businessman', 'successful integration', 'dramatic dip', 'new information', 'valuation method', 'Belgian citizenship', 'tax policies', 'seven places', 'Asian demand', 'Chinese consumers', 'double digits', 'import tariffs', 'Bill Gates', 'Jeff Bezos', '$100 billion club', 'record high', 'luxury world', 'Elon Musk', 'largest fortunes', 'significant rise', 'personal fortune', '22 percent increase', 'six percent', 'public backlash', 'record-breaking year', 'short time', 'conglomerate LVMH', 'LVMH sales', 'LVMH products', 'ownership stake', 'Bernard Arnault', 'As Arnault', 'LVMH shares', '34 years', '40 percent', '80 percent', '18 percent', '15 percent', '54 percent', '97.5 stake', 'past', 'months', 'top', 'Headlines', 'December', 'LVMHF', 'slew', 'Tiffany', 'Co.', 'race', 'duo', 'turns', 'road', 'control', 'chairman', 'CEO', 'position', 'rises', 'advantage', 'bankruptcy', 'Boussac', 'merger', 'revenue', 'Japan', 'mid-2005', 'France', 'profits', 'brands', 'Bulgari', 'less', 'value', 'drop', 'downturn', 'tenth', 'application', 'attempt', 'claims', 'bid', 'luck', 'title', 'Europe', 'spending', 'part', 'clothing', 'half', 'Takeovers', 'centi-billionaire', 'July']",2023-06-15,2023-06-16,observer.com

This includes the adoption of the VIROO platform  developed by Virtualware.The initiative  funded by the Ministry of Education and Vocational Training and the European Union - Next Generation EU  aims to harness the benefits of VR technologies for more participatory  collaborative and experiential learning. It aims to bridge the gap between theoretical learning and its application in the real world.As a result of this collaboration  the installation and commissioning of the first two wireless Virtual Reality Rooms will allow virtual reality learning resources and activities to be deployed on a full-scale  and also remotely.The new VR rooms  which have been leased until the end of the project  are equipped with Wifi 6 connectivity and HTC Vive Focus 3 viewers with wireless technology. This  combined with the VIROO® platform  provides users with a much more comfortable and fluid collaborative streaming experience  eliminating the need for the backpack PCs that are more common in this type of environment  known as LBE (local based entertainment).The CIFP Txurdinaga LHII and the IES Carles Vallbona have long been advocates of innovation in their educational work and are firmly committed to the potential of immersive technology to radically transform education and prepare students for the jobs of the future.""Our ambition is to experiment with this type of space as a training tool for our students  knowing that these technologies will be used in the productive sector. The 4.0 and 5.0 environments will take advantage of these technologies to simulate and train different productive processes and services "" explained Jaime Corrales  Director of Innovation at CIFP Txurdinaga LHII.Another aspect of the technology is the ability to create and deploy learning resources and activities in virtual reality autonomously. Thanks to the ease of use of the VIROO platform  teachers and students do not need extensive programming skills (low-coding).According to Miquel Altayó  project manager at the Carles Vallbona Institute  ""this project has opened a door to the world of virtual reality that will undoubtedly benefit our students and serve as a base camp for future achievements.""This type of initiative promotes the quality of inter-professional training on a real scale  regardless of the geographical location  and encourages the methodological evolution of the vocational training centres.CIFP Txurdinaga LHIILocated in the Bilbao neighbourhood that gives it its name  the CIFP Txurdinaga LHII is becoming a reference in Vocational Training  not only in Bilbao but also in Bizkaia and the whole of the Basque Autonomous Community. Pioneers in methodological innovation (Ethazi or High Performance Cycles)  over the last few years it has continued its commitment to innovation with truly successful results that have placed this institute among the most innovative in Basque Vocational Training; for the academic year 2023-24 it will be working on different projects related to Virtual Reality  Artificial Vision  Cloud Computing and Big Data  Mixed Reality applied to students with special needs  Internet of Senses and Quantum Computing  with teachers and students from the departments of Chemistry  Computer Science  Social Integration and Commerce participating in these projects.IES Carles VallbonaLocated in Granollers  since 2009  it has been recognised as a primary school for the practice of sports in the studies of Baccalaureate and High School. In addition to its great commitment to the linguistic plan  it offers studies in Compulsory Secondary Education  Baccalaureate  Intermediate Level Training Cycles and Higher Level Training Cycles in Administration  Computer Science and Commerce.VIRTUALWAREVirtualware is a pioneering global technology firm specializing in virtual reality solutions.

Prior to this  Dr Wagener was a Senior Partner at TranScrip Partners LLP where he was the strategic lead on several drug programs. This involved work on assets at various stages in the drug development life cycle and leading on due diligence  development strategy  and Phase I–III clinical studies.

The launch of the company comes six months after the initiative was announced and has been unveiled during VivaTech  Europe’s largest startup and technology conference held annually in ParisUnlimitail will partner with retailers and brands  bringing the scale  connectivity and consistency for retail media to reach its full potential in those geographies.Unlimitail is built on the most advanced technologies  CitrusAd powered by Epsilon  and the deepest retail expertise from Carrefour.In only six months  Unlimitail has already converted its first 13 retail partners  representing together more than 120 million loyalty customers and 1.5 billion pages viewed a month: Kingfisher France  Groupe Galeries Lafayette  Rakuten France  Showroomprive Group  ÏDKIDS  LuisaViaRoma  MyOrigines  Bringo  Electra Group  Maquillalia  Juguetilandia  Public and 2 Carrefour franchise partners in Morocco (LabelVie) and Israël (Electra Consumer Products).Link to vision filmRetail Media is the fastest-growing channel for media spend  revolutionizing traditional media hierarchies. Within the next two years  it is expected to overtake TV advertising spend for U.S. consumer packaged goods companies.Until now  the fragmentation of the market in Europe and Latin America has made it difficult for all players to fully unlock its potential.
