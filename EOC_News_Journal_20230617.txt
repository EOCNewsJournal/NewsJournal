Bringing together the best of European mediscience companies to celebrate achievement and recognise success  its awards are hotly contested.Ian Crosbie  Chief Executive Officer of Sequana Medical  commented: “We developed the alfapump to transform the lives of patients with recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis – a rapidly growing patient population due to NASH / NAFLD epidemic. Our objective is to replace the standard of care that has changed little in over 2 000 years and deliver improved clinical outcomes  quality of life and cost savings. The recognition of this work by our industry peers is a tremendous accolade for the Sequana team and celebrates all the hard work that has gone into developing this transformational device.”About the alfapumpSequana Medical’s alfapump is a fully implantable  wirelessly charged device which continuously collects ascites as it forms in the abdominal cavity and moves it into the bladder  where it is naturally passed from the body through urination. In Europe  the alfapump has received CE mark-approval for the treatment of refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis and malignant ascites and has been included in key European treatment guidelines. In the US  the Company’s key growth market  the alfapump has been granted breakthrough device designation by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis. The POSEIDON study  intended to support the approval of the alfapump in North America  reported strong top-line results meeting all primary efficacy endpoints with statistical significance and safety in line with expectations. Filing of the Pre-Market Approval (PMA) application with the US FDA is planned for H2 2023. Sequana Medical plans to commercialize the alfapump directly in the US  using a specialized in-house sales force targeting 90 liver transplant centers (covering 95% of adult liver transplants). The North American market for the alfapump is forecast to grow at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 6-7%  from over 75 000 patients in 2025  reaching a market opportunity of over $2.5 billion by 2035  with NASH being the major driver of growth.For more information  please contact:Sequana MedicalLies VannesteDirector Investor RelationsE: IR@sequanamedical.comT: +32 (0)498 053579Optimum Strategic CommunicationsNick Bastin  Jonathan Edwards  Vici RabbettsE: Sequana@optimumcomms.comT: +44 (0) 208 078 4357About Sequana MedicalSequana Medical NV is a pioneer in treating fluid overload  a serious and frequent clinical complication in patients with liver disease  heart failure and cancer. These patients can have up to 15 liters of extra fluid in their bodies  causing major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility that severely impacts daily life. Although diuretics are standard of care  the problem is that in many patients they are no longer effective and / or tolerable. There are limited effective treatment options for these patients  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing “diuretic-resistant” patient population.alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  delivering major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients and reducing costs for healthcare systems. The Company has reported positive primary endpoint data from the North American pivotal POSEIDON trial of the alfapump in recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis  enabling the filing of a Pre-Market Approval (PMA) application with the FDA  planned for H2 2023. Having delivered clinical proof-of-concept for DSR as a disease-modifying drug program for the treatment of heart failure  the Company has commenced MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical trial of DSR 2.0  with initial data expected in Q4 2023.Sequana Medical is listed on Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium.

Conditions for the interim dividend in the form of an optional dividend As announced in the annual press release of 26 May 2023  the Board of Directors of Retail Estates decided on that day to pay  in the form of an optional dividend  a gross interim dividend for financial year 2022-2023 (which started on 1 April 2022 and ended on 31 March 2023) amounting to € 4.90 (€ 3.43 net  i.e. the net dividend per share after deduction of withholding tax at a rate of 30%1) per share (participating in the profits of financial year 2022-2023). In the context of its decision to distribute an interim dividend to the shareholders  the Board of Directors offers the shareholders the possibility to contribute the amount of their claims arising from the distribution of the interim dividend to the capital of the Company in return for the issue of new shares (in addition to the option to receive the interim dividend in cash and the option to opt for a combination of the two preceding options). The new shares issued within the context of this capital increase will participate in the profits as from 1 April 2023. Taking into account the obligation of Retail Estates as a public BE-REIT to pay out dividends pursuant to article 13 of the Royal Decree of 13 July 2014 on regulated real estate companies  the Board of Directors will propose to the annual general meeting of 24 July 2023 to not pay any additional dividend for the financial year 2022/2023. The contribution in kind of claims against Retail Estates in the context of the optional interim dividend and the associated capital increase improve the shareholders' equity of the company and therefore reduce its (legally capped) debt ratio. This opens up the possibility for Retail Estates to perform additional debt-financed transactions in the future in order to further realise its growth strategy. The optional interim dividend also makes it possible to retain funds in the Company (in line with the net dividend rights contributed to the company's capital)  which in turn reinforces the company's liquidity position. In addition  it strengthens the ties with the shareholders. On 14 June 2023  the Board of Directors established the conditions and modalities of the interim optional dividend  including the final issue price and the option period.

The new credit facility replaces the existing undrawn €400 million RCF  which was set to mature in June 2024.Despite the RCF being oversubscribed  the recent deleveraging of the Group led to a reduced notional for the new RCF compared to the existing one  still providing enough flexibility to cover upcoming maturities if needed. At the date of signing  the applicable margin is unchanged at 85bp compared to the previous RCF. Importantly  this is the first Sustainability-linked loan of the Group. The ESG criteria are based on Quadient’s official CO 2 reduction targets1 for both scopes 1 & 2 and for scope 3  with each KPI having a +/- 2bp impact on the RCF applicable margin.Laurent du Passage  Chief Financial Officer of Quadient  said: ""We are delighted with the completion of this transaction which provides the Group with financial flexibility at attractive terms under the current market conditions.

By their nature  forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may occur in the future. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that are outside of our control and impossible to predict and may cause actual results to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations  estimates  forecasts  analyses and projections about the industry in which we operate and management's beliefs and assumptions about possible future events. You are cautioned not to put undue reliance on these forward-looking statements  which only express views as at the date of this press release and are neither predictions nor guarantees of possible future events or circumstances.We do not undertake any obligation to release publicly any revisions to these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this press release or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events  except as may be required under applicable securities law.Alternative performance measuresThe financial information in this release includes non-IFRS financial measures and ratios (e.g. non-IFRS metrics  such as adjusted EBITDA) that are not recognized as measures of financial performance or liquidity under IFRS. The non-IFRS financial measures presented are measures used by management to monitor the underlying performance of the business and operations and  have therefore not been audited or reviewed. Furthermore  they may not be indicative of the historical operating results  nor are they meant to be predictive of future results. These non-IFRS measures are presented because they are considered important supplementary measurements of FL Entertainment N.V.'s (the ""Company"") performance  and we believe that these and similar measures are widely used in the industry in which the Company operates as a way to evaluate a company's operating performance and liquidity. Not all companies calculate non-IFRS financial measures in the same manner or on a consistent basis. As a result  these measures and ratios may not be comparable to measures used by other companies under the same or similar names.Regulated information related to this press release is available on the website:https://www.flentertainment.com/",positive,0.63,0.36,0.01,negative,0.0,0.12,0.88,True,English,"['FL Entertainment N', 'Successful bond buyback', 'Senior Secured Notes', 'Banijay', 'Senior Secured Note (SSN) bonds', 'growing online sports betting platform', 'largest independent producer distributor', 'EU Market Abuse Regulation', 'FL Entertainment N.V.', '30-year entertainment industry pioneer', 'cash tender offer', 'Stéphane Courbit', 'Betclic Everest Group', 'applicable securities law', 'current credit ratings', 'FL Entertainment Group', 'historical operating results', 'possible future events', 'debt coverage ratios', 'Alternative performance measures', 'IFRS financial measures', 'financial flexibility', 'current expectations', 'financial performance', 'operating performance', 'future results', 'IFRS metrics', 'debt position', 'debt portfolio', 'financial information', 'H1 2023 results', 'actual results', 'strong interest', 'bond buyback', 'Investor Relations', 'Press Relations', 'Boëton', 'Nicolas Grange', 'global leader', 'multimedia content', 'combined revenue', 'Euronext Amsterdam', 'FLE NA', 'FLE.AS', 'unknown risks', 'other factors', 'undue reliance', 'unanticipated events', 'underlying performance', 'non-IFRS measures', 'supplementary measurements', 'similar measures', 'consistent basis', 'similar names', 'press release', 'inside information', 'Regulated information', 'Forward-looking statements', 'Caroline Cohen', 'same manner', 'other companies', 'Investors', 'Banijay', 'part', 'objective', 'Agenda', '2 August', 'Phone', 'gaming', 'strengths', 'world', 'Europe', 'EBITDA', 'July', 'ISIN', 'Bloomberg', 'Reuters', 'communication', 'meaning', 'Article', 'nature', 'uncertainty', 'circumstances', 'uncertainties', 'control', 'estimates', 'forecasts', 'analyses', 'projections', 'management', 'beliefs', 'assumptions', 'views', 'date', 'predictions', 'guarantees', 'obligation', 'revisions', 'adjusted', 'liquidity', 'business', 'operations', 'Company', 'way', 'website', 'flentertainment']",2023-06-16,2023-06-17,marketscreener.com

The data were presented at the 17th International Conference on Malignant Lymphoma  in Lugano  Switzerland.As of March 4  2022  data cutoff  patients in the KIR3DL2-expressing MF cochort (cohort 2  n=21) received a median of 4 prior systemic therapies  and had a median follow-up of 12.2 months. In the KIR3DL2 non-expressing cohort (cohort 3  n=18)  patients received a median of 4.5 prior systemic therapies and had a median follow-up of 13.8 months.Lymph Node assessment is an important component of staging and response assessment in CTCL (cutaneous T cell lymphomas). In a recent update to the Olsen 2011 guidelines  it was clarified that the pathological assessment of lymph nodes be limited to those that satisfy nodal lymphoma i.e. N3 designation (Olsen 20221).Based on these criteria  results showed that lacutamab produced an increased global objective response rate (ORR) of 42.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]  24.5-63.5) in patients with KIR3DL2 ≥ 1% MF (cohort 2  n=21)  including 2 complete responses and 7 partial responses. Clinical Benefit Rate remained unchanged at 85.7% [95% CI tbc]. In Cohort 3  comprising 18 patients with KIR3DL2 < 1% MF  findings remain unchanged.“We are pleased to see the improved ORR of lacutamab in KIR3DL2 expressing mycosis fungoides patients  confirming the previously observed clinical activity in this heavily treated population ” said Dr. Joyson Karakunnel  Chief Medical Officer of Innate Pharma. “We look forward to final data from the TELLOMAK Phase 2 trial in both Sézary syndrome and mycosis fungoides in 2023 and progressing the two additional trials that are ongoing with lacutamab in Peripheral T cell lymphoma.”Dr. Pierluigi Porcu  Director  Division of Hematologic Malignancies and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation  Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center  Jefferson Health  Philadelphia  added: “The higher global ORR according to updated lymph node evaluation highlights the importance of the adoption of latest guidelines  and is welcomed by the CTCL community. Treatment options are limited for patients with CTCL and the updated assessment of the TELLOMAK trial adds to growing evidence supporting the ongoing development of lacutamab in T cell lymphomas. We thank the investigators  clinical research coordinators  patients and caregivers involved in the ongoing TELLOMAK program.”Summary of Preliminary Efficacy Results in Cohort 2 (KIR3DL2 ≥ 1%):Best Response in Skin N=21 Best Response in Blood N=8 Best Global Response N=21 Olsen 2011 (N1  N2  N3  Nx involved) Olsen 2022 (N3 lymphoma involved ) Best Response (N) CR PR SD PD NE 2 (9.5%) 10 (47.6%) 7 (33.3%) 2 (9.5%) - 5 (62.5%) 0 (0%) 3 (37.5%) 0 (0%) - 2 (9.5%) 4 (19%) 13 (61.9%) 2 (9.5%) - 2 (9.5%) 7 (33.3%) 10 (47.6%) 2 (9.5%) - ORR% [95%CI] 57.1% [36.5-75.5] 62.5% [30.6-86.3] 28.6% [13.8-50.0] 42.9% [24.5-63.5]About LacutamabLacutamab is a first-in-class anti-KIR3DL2 humanized cytotoxicity-inducing antibody that is currently in clinical trials for treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL)  an orphan disease  and peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL). Rare cutaneous lymphomas of T lymphocytes have a poor prognosis with few efficacious and safe therapeutic options at advanced stages.KIR3DL2 is an inhibitory receptor of the KIR family  expressed by approximately 65% of patients across all CTCL subtypes and expressed by up 90% of patients with certain aggressive CTCL subtypes  in particular  Sézary syndrome. It is expressed by up to 50% of patients with mycosis fungoides and peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL). It has a restricted expression on normal tissues.Lacutamab is granted European Medicines Agency (EMA) PRIME designation and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Fast Track designation for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory Sézary syndrome who have received at least two prior systemic therapies. Lacutamab is granted orphan drug status in the European Union and in the United States for the treatment of CTCL.About TELLOMAK:TELLOMAK is a global  open-label  multi-cohort Phase 2 clinical trial recruiting patients with Sézary syndrome and mycosis fungoides (MF) in the United States and Europe. Specifically:Cohort 1: lacutamab being evaluated as a single agent in approximately 60 patients with Sézary syndrome who have received at least two prior systemic therapies  including mogamulizumab. The Sézary syndrome cohort of the study could enable the registration of lacutamab in this indication.Cohort 2: lacutamab being evaluated as a single agent in patients with MF that express KIR3DL2  as determined at baseline with a Simon 2-stage design.Cohort 3: lacutamab being evaluated as a single agent in patients with MF that do not express KIR3DL2  as determined at baseline  with a Simon-2 stage design.All comers: lacutamab being evaluated as a single agent in patients with both KIR3DL2 expressing and non-expressing MF to explore the correlation between the level of KIR3DL2 expression and treatment outcomes utilizing a formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) assay under development as a companion diagnostic.Overall  MF cohorts (cohort 2  cohort 3 and all comers) will enroll approximately 100 patients.The primary endpoint of the trial is objective global response rate. Key secondary endpoints are progression-free survival  duration of response  overall survival  quality of life  pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity and adverse events.About Innate PharmaInnate Pharma S.A. is a global  clinical-stage biotechnology company developing immunotherapies for cancer patients.

The magnitude of the transformation provides the foundations to separate and create two global leaders. Each will start with balance sheets and liquidity  reflecting both their improved past performance and their robust business outlook. As a result  each is poised and resourced to create superior and sustainable value for their stakeholders.Dr. Ilham Kadri  CEO of Solvay  said “Today marks a new milestone in the separation project we announced over one year ago. Having both companies target investment grade ratings with distinctive and appropriate financial policies is a great achievement. With the optimized capital structures  each company is well equipped to operate independently to achieve their goals and create more compelling value for all.”Solvay has developed targeted capital structures for each independent company based on their respective growth trajectories  investment objectives  and dividend policies.SpecialtyCo - A Specialties Leader with Superior Growth PotentialSpecialtyCo develops innovative  value-added solutions that support a more sustainable world. SpecialtyCo will seek to drive above-market growth  industry-leading margins and compelling returns.SpecialtyCo will maintain disciplined capital allocation and will be committed to a strong investment-grade rating.The current dividend level of Solvay for the 2023 financial year will  after completion of the separation  be apportioned between the two companies  with SpecialtyCo assuming 40% of the dividend share.SpecialtyCo is expected to adopt a dividend policy that enables the Company to invest in the growth that will deliver sustainable value creation to shareholders  whilst preserving a structural capacity to deleverage over time.EssentialCo - An Essential Chemicals Leader with Resilient Cash GenerationEssentialCo masters technologies that have proven essential across a number of attractive and resilient end markets. With a focus on enhancing its cost leadership  EssentialCo will seek to maximize its cash generation.EssentialCo will be committed to an investment grade rating.The current dividend level of Solvay for the 2023 financial year will  after completion of the separation  be apportioned to EssentialCo for 60% of the dividend share.EssentialCo is expected to maintain Solvay’s current dividend policy of stable or increasing dividends.Additional Information and Next StepsEssentialCo is expected to issue around €1.5bn in new bonds in the period following the separation. As previously indicated  existing Solvay SA bondholders will be offered the opportunity to transfer obligations to SpecialtyCo before the separation  consistent with the expectation that it will enjoy a strong investment grade rating.By contrast  hybrid bonds are not  at this point in time  expected to be a permanent part of the capital structures of either company. Solvay plans to call the PNC 2023 Hybrids (€800m) at their first call date and plans a tender of the PNC 2024 Hybrid (€500m) ahead of the separation.The implementation of these transactions and their terms will depend on market conditions and will be announced to all bondholders in August. Further  Solvay reserves the right to change the approach to planned transactions prior to their implementation.The targeted indicative capital structures1 to support value creation of EssentialCo and SpecialtyCo are summarized in the table below.(€ Bn) EssentialCo SpecialtyCo Profit Underlying EBITDA2 1.3 1.9 Financial Debt Underlying Gross debt -2.5 -2.8 Underlying Net debt -1.9 -1.6 Other Liabilities Net pension liabilities -0.7 -0.3 Environmental liabilities -0.4 -0.31 Financial debt indications are based on projections at the end of 2023 whereas Other Liabilities indications are based on end 2022 unaudited figures.2 Underlying EBITDA: 2022 unaudited figuresDisclaimerThe contemplated separation is subject to general market conditions and customary closing conditions  including final approval by Solvay’s Board of Directors  consent of certain financing providers and shareholder approval at an extraordinary general meeting  and is expected to be completed in December 2023.

This unprecedented project will be the world's first demonstration of a completely new low- carbon mobility solution. To build the mobility of tomorrow  Euro Airship has been working for over 10 years with renowned partners such as Capgemini  Groupe La Poste and Orange  and others in convergence  to achieve the industrialization of a ""zero-carbon"" solution.Reach « zero-carbon » mobilityMobility  essential to society  represents a major challenge in terms of carbon emissions. Global warming  over-consumption of fossil fuels  traffic growth  CO2 emissions  transport and infrastructure costs are all the issues that need to be addressed.The aeronautical industry  for a long time now  has been confronted to these major challenges  due to its excessive dependence on fossil fuels and the scale of emissions produced by aircrafts. It is therefore urgent to rethink mobility solutions in order to develop technologies that are more efficient and  above all  more respectful of humankind and environment.A new  innovative and sustainable air solutionEuro Airship  an innovative aeronautical company based in Pau  designs  manufactures and sells sustainable rigid airships. Relying on cutting-edge technical expertise and a passion for innovation  Euro Airship has pushed back the boundaries of aerial mobility. Their airships combine efficiency  elegance  and respect of the environment  and are powered by advanced technologies that guarantee safety and efficiency.The different models are also designed to meet today's many challenges  with immediate industrial applications: transport  green tourism  freight  humanitarian aid  civil and military surveillance.The Solar Airship One Project: air mobility enters the decarbonized era!To promote a new sustainable mobility to the world  Euro Airship announces the launch of its project: Solar Airship One  the first non-stop world tour flight without fossil fuels. Scheduled for 2026  this epic journey will fly over 40 000 kms in 20 days  following a trajectory close to the equator at an average altitude of 6 000m. The solar airship developed by Euro Airship willfly without any noise  fossil fuel or CO2 emissions. This mission has been made possible thanks to the support of key partners and industrial players: Capgemini  Groupe La Poste  and Orange  as well as others in convergence. For the same reasons  Solar Airship One has brought together emblematic French aeronautical sponsors and pilots: Bertrand Piccard  Dorine Bourneton  Jean-Pierre Haigneré and Michel Tognini. Until the end of 2023  Euro Airship remains open to strategic collaborations with partners who are in line with their values on this unique project.""The SolarAirship project demonstrates that it is possible to catalyze an ecosystem to foster the emergence of sustainable air transport solutions. After being an engineering partner at the heart of the development of Solar Impulse  we are delighted with this partnership emblematic of the work that our engineering teams are carrying out to accelerate the efficient integration of sustainable technologies."" said Corinne Jouanny  Head of Portfolio and Industry Centers of Excellence  Capgemini Engineering. ""For the past 3 years  our engineers and researchers have been working closely with Euro Airship on the design of this innovative airship: from the rigid structure  of the different envelopes  to the manufacturing and assembly processes  not forgetting the construction of a digital twin of the aircraft in flight  Capgemini's teams are putting their skills to work on this unprecedented challenge.""""We've already supported Solar Impulse  notably through the creation of a stamp honoring the first solar airplane. Two years on  it's a natural step for La Poste to join this new Solar Airship One challenge. Firstly  because we are very proud to see a postal worker and the world's first paraplegic pilot  Dorine Bourneton  taking part in the adventure. And secondly  because Solar Airship One will be helping to promote a new form of sustainable mobility. At La Poste  we've been very committed to the ecological transition and sustainable finance for several years now "" comments Marie-Aude Dubanchet  La Poste Group's Deputy Managing Director in charge of communications.""Orange is proud to be part of the epic project  Solar Airship One; an ambitious  innovative and unifying project that ushers in the era of decarbonized mobility. This partnership is emblematic of our commitment to deploy the full potential of digital technology to support environmental transition in all sectors of activity. With this in mind  Orange will supply a low- orbit satellite communication system ensuring a secure and robust global link that meets the technical specifications needed and guarantees continuity of communications between the airship and the ground. Drawing on its innovation ecosystem  Orange will provide solutions and projects around AI  data and IoT. This will allow us to collect  analyse  and cross- reference observation data from the airship and its pilots. The avenues opened up by Solar Airship One for the future of sustainable and responsible mobility of people and goods are exciting "" adds Elizabeth Tchoungui  Executive Director in charge of Corporate Social Responsibility for the Orange Group.At the forefront of the aeronautical industry  Euro Airship is presenting a new  sustainable and versatile air transport solution that address current and future societal challenges.About Euro AirshipFounded in 2010 by Jean Lescat and Marc Sénépart  Euro Airship is an innovative French company specialized in designing  constructing  and selling rigid airships.

The magnitude of the transformation provides the foundations to separate and create two global leaders. Each will start with balance sheets and liquidity  reflecting both their improved past performance and their robust business outlook. As a result  each is poised and resourced to create superior and sustainable value for their stakeholders.Dr. Ilham Kadri  CEO of Solvay  said “Today marks a new milestone in the separation project we announced over one year ago. Having both companies target investment grade ratings with distinctive and appropriate financial policies is a great achievement. With the optimized capital structures  each company is well equipped to operate independently to achieve their goals and create more compelling value for all.”Solvay has developed targeted capital structures for each independent company based on their respective growth trajectories  investment objectives  and dividend policies.SpecialtyCo - A Specialties Leader with Superior Growth PotentialSpecialtyCo develops innovative  value-added solutions that support a more sustainable world. SpecialtyCo will seek to drive above-market growth  industry-leading margins and compelling returns.SpecialtyCo will maintain disciplined capital allocation and will be committed to a strong investment-grade rating.The current dividend level of Solvay for the 2023 financial year will  after completion of the separation  be apportioned between the two companies  with SpecialtyCo assuming 40% of the dividend share.SpecialtyCo is expected to adopt a dividend policy that enables the Company to invest in the growth that will deliver sustainable value creation to shareholders  whilst preserving a structural capacity to deleverage over time.EssentialCo - An Essential Chemicals Leader with Resilient Cash GenerationEssentialCo masters technologies that have proven essential across a number of attractive and resilient end markets. With a focus on enhancing its cost leadership  EssentialCo will seek to maximize its cash generation.EssentialCo will be committed to an investment grade rating.The current dividend level of Solvay for the 2023 financial year will  after completion of the separation  be apportioned to EssentialCo for 60% of the dividend share.EssentialCo is expected to maintain Solvay’s current dividend policy of stable or increasing dividends.Additional Information and Next StepsEssentialCo is expected to issue around €1.5bn in new bonds in the period following the separation. As previously indicated  existing Solvay SA bondholders will be offered the opportunity to transfer obligations to SpecialtyCo before the separation  consistent with the expectation that it will enjoy a strong investment grade rating.By contrast  hybrid bonds are not  at this point in time  expected to be a permanent part of the capital structures of either company. Solvay plans to call the PNC 2023 Hybrids (€800m) at their first call date and plans a tender of the PNC 2024 Hybrid (€500m) ahead of the separation.The implementation of these transactions and their terms will depend on market conditions and will be announced to all bondholders in August. Further  Solvay reserves the right to change the approach to planned transactions prior to their implementation.The targeted indicative capital structures1 to support value creation of EssentialCo and SpecialtyCo are summarized in the table below.(€ Bn) EssentialCo SpecialtyCo Profit Underlying EBITDA2 1.3 1.9 Financial Debt Underlying Gross debt -2.5 -2.8 Underlying Net debt -1.9 -1.6 Other Liabilities Net pension liabilities -0.7 -0.3 Environmental liabilities -0.4 -0.31 Financial debt indications are based on projections at the end of 2023 whereas Other Liabilities indications are based on end 2022 unaudited figures.2 Underlying EBITDA: 2022 unaudited figuresDisclaimerThe contemplated separation is subject to general market conditions and customary closing conditions  including final approval by Solvay’s Board of Directors  consent of certain financing providers and shareholder approval at an extraordinary general meeting  and is expected to be completed in December 2023.

We just passed the milestone of generating more than 50% of our revenue outside France. At the same time  we have developed new expertise in the energy industry – smart meters  charging stations  and solar panels – and began offering new services in France under major European investment plans. Our growth model and financial strength have allowed us to grow steadily and weather crises while preserving the company’s business.Solutions30 managed this growth by constantly strengthening its internal control processes. Starting in 2019  we launched a far-reaching overhaul of both the company’s standards and the internal organization of risk control and compliance. In 2022  an in-depth external audit helped us complete this process.Finally  under the responsibility of our Group Head of ESG  Risk and Compliance  we are now fully committed to our CSR approach. We will soon present our objectives  focusing on our societal role with young people  our safety and diversity commitments for employees  and our carbon reduction targets.During this general meeting  to prepare for the group’s expansion in the medium term  we have broadened the skills and expertise of our supervisory board and reorganized our management board. With its more diverse skill set  our supervisory board will be better equipped to fulfill its advisory and oversight roles. Our management board is now more agile and surrounded by an enlarged executive committee of experts. This reorganized team will soon be charting the course that will bring us to €2.5 billion in revenue in the medium term.”Five years of transformation that have brought Solutions30 to €1 billion in revenueIn 20 years  Solutions30 has grown from a small business to an international corporation that is on track to reach €1 billion in revenue in 2023. To support such fast-paced growth  Solutions30 has strengthened its compliance  risk management  and ESG standards:Strengthening of the risk management  internal control  and compliance policyStarting in 2022  Solutions30 began defining new control processes and creating a risks and internal control system manual. To ensure that these procedures are properly implemented  and more broadly to reinforce group compliance  Solutions30 has appointed Nathalie Duchesne as Group Head of ESG  Risk and Compliance. She has begun training and raising the awareness of all employees about these topics  implemented control processes in each country and department  and gathered relevant information to better inform the decisions of the Management Board. She works with a dedicated network of local contacts in the departments of each country.Simplification of the legal organization chartIn less than five years  Solutions30 has carried out a comprehensive legal simplification program to facilitate its internal control  eliminating nearly 50 legal entities  mainly through intra-group restructuring.Systematic control of the company’s subcontractorsSolutions30 has implemented a new third-party verification policy and appointed a dedicated team of eight people to carry out systematic checks on its subcontractors. This approach relies on the subcontractor sourcing platform the group set up in 2021  mySupplace  which currently includes 3 000 partner companies. This collaborative platform also serves as the group’s compliance tool  allowing documents supplied by these companies to be verified  analyzed  and archived.New governanceOver the past five years  Solutions30 has strengthened and broadened the skills of all its management bodies (Supervisory Board  Management Board  and Executive Committee)  with more than 50% of their members being newly appointed. In recent years  the Supervisory Board has welcomed five new members  out of seven  each bringing to the table extensive expertise in finance  auditing  compliance  ESG  and corporate strategy.At the same time  Solutions30 has strengthened its codes of conduct and anti-corruption policy  while focusing on team training and awareness. A whistleblowing platform  which has proven its effectiveness at resolving situations  ensures that all weak signals  misconduct  non-compliance  or internal risks get reported.Building a CSR approachSince 2019  Solutions30 has been committed to CSR (corporate social responsibility) that is aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. In 2022  the group stepped up this commitment by changing the “Strategy” committee to the “Strategy and ESG” committee  making ESG a core part of the group’s roadmap. The ESG strategy  objectives  and performance indicators were overhauled to make them more transparent  and the group is currently working on a carbon footprint project using the GHG Protocol to improve how it measures CO2 emissions. The results of this work will be communicated in the near future.In terms of employee safety  Solutions30 has initiated a review of procedures aimed at preventing work-related accidents and illnesses  raised awareness among employees on how to reduce their exposure to risk  and trained teams in ethics and compliance.For its social commitments  Solutions30 has a yearslong recruitment  skills development  and vocational training policy designed to help young people  some of whom have dropped out of school  to land their first job. The policy also helps people in the process of changing careers by training them for positions in the digital and energy professions of the future. In 2022  Solutions30 recruited 924 young people under the age of 30  representing 40% of new hires and up to 21% of the entire workforce. More than 180 000 hours of training  or 25 hours per employee  were provided in 2022 in promising technical fields or in training modules on interpersonal skills and customer service.The group is also working towards gender equality by giving women a more central role  with the aim of increasing the number of women in managerial positions by more than 10% in 2023 and achieving equal pay for men and women. The addition of Paola Bruno to the Supervisory Board brings the proportion of women on this governance body to 43%.Solutions30 enters a new phase of growth and changes dimensionWith its solid structure and strengthened governance  Solutions30 is poised to enter a new phase in its history and is ready to scale accordingly.To meet the market’s needs  customer expectations  and the challenges of its ongoing transformation  Solutions30 now relies on three complementary bodies: (i) a Supervisory Board with enhanced powers to fulfill its oversight role  (ii) a Management Board limited to four members  which keeps the group agile  streamlines decision-making  and conserves its strong growth momentum  and (iii) an expanded Excom that includes support functions and country heads  all of whom work in close collaboration with the Management Board.A Supervisory Board with strengthened and diversified competences to meet the demands of its oversight roleWith today’s approval of Paola Bruno’s nomination  the Supervisory Board now comprises 7 members  all of whom are independent:Three long-standing members  who joined before the 2018-2023 period  to guarantee the stability of the group’s governance: Alexander Sator  Caroline Tissot  and Jean-Paul Cottet. Their intricate knowledge of Solutions30 and its objectives for the next 5 years puts them in an ideal position to offer strategic advice for the company’s future.Three recently appointed members  who have brought new ideas to the board and broadened its expertise in finance  audit  risk and compliance: Thomas Kremer  appointed in 2022  who brings his legal and corporate governance expertise as well as his knowledge of data protection  compliance  and risk management; Yves Kerveillant and Pascale Mourvillier  who bring their expertise in corporate finance and auditing.One new member  Paola Bruno  with 30 years’ experience in investment banking  who once again strengthens the diversity and skills of the Supervisory Board with her background in market finance  corporate finance and strategy  investor relations  and compliance  especially in times of crisis. Her experience in both Italy and the United Kingdom  two key markets for the group  is an important asset and preserves the complementarity of international experience among Supervisory Board members.Forty-three percent of the Supervisory Board members are now female  which brings the group into compliance with the European “Women on Boards” Directive  ahead of its transposition into Luxembourg law.To help the Supervisory Board oversee the group’s commitments  the audit and strategy committees have been expanded to cover risk management  compliance  and ESG. These committees have been renamed the Audit  Risk and Compliance Committee and the Strategy and ESG Committee.A smaller Management Board with an expanded Excom for agile  streamlined performanceComprising four members with in-depth knowledge of the company  the Management Board continues to be headed by Gianbeppi Fortis  Solutions30’s founding CEO  who defines and steers the group’s strategy. Luc Brusselaers  Chief Revenue Officer  coordinates the group’s sales force to maximize synergies  standardize processes  and grow sales across Europe.Wojciech Pomykała  who joined the Management Board last February  has been named Chief Operations Officer. He will be responsible for managing the group’s operations  including information systems and Solutions30’s ongoing transformation. His role will be to keep operations in sync with promising areas of development for the group  specifically its strong growth in the telecom market outside France.Amaury Boilot will take over as General Manager of the French entity. After three years running one of the French business units  which he successfully transformed and grew  Amaury was then put in charge of the group’s Finance Department in 2017 and joined the Management Board. Drawing on his operational and financial experience  his mission will be to improve profitability in France and continue the transition to new energy activities. He has also been appointed Secretary General  with responsibility for the group’s financial  compliance  and legal support functions. His term of office as a member of the Management Board has been renewed for four more years.João Martinho’s term was not renewed. João Martinho will leave Solutions30 at the end of July. Solutions30 thanks him for his commitment and hard work.This agile structure will streamline decision-making  allowing the company to quickly seize market opportunities.The Management Board is supported by an Executive Committee whose members manage the company’s support functions  including finance  human resources  risk  compliance and ESG  communications and investor relations  information systems  and legal. The head of each country is also part of this committee  reflecting the group’s international strategic ambitions and the growing share of revenue generated outside France  now over 50%.Nomination of a new Chief Financial Officer to prepare for the new phase of growthReporting to Amaury Boilot  Jonathan Crauwels has been named CFO and will also be a member of the Executive Committee. His role will be to support the group’s businesses as their fast-paced growth continues. Before stepping into this role  he successfully drove the profitable and cash-generating growth of Solutions30 Belgium  doubling revenue at Unit-T and playing a key role in setting up the joint venture with Telenet in 2018.A new dimension: Solutions30 targets revenue of €2.5 billion in the medium termWith this new organization and its solid positioning in businesses driven by Europe’s massive digital and energy investment plans  management confirms that Solutions30 is embarking on a new period of growth with a medium-term revenue target of €2.5 billion and double-digit EBITDA margins.

We just passed the milestone of generating more than 50% of our revenue outside France. At the same time  we have developed new expertise in the energy industry – smart meters  charging stations  and solar panels – and began offering new services in France under major European investment plans. Our growth model and financial strength have allowed us to grow steadily and weather crises while preserving the company’s business.Solutions30 managed this growth by constantly strengthening its internal control processes. Starting in 2019  we launched a far-reaching overhaul of both the company’s standards and the internal organization of risk control and compliance. In 2022  an in-depth external audit helped us complete this process.Finally  under the responsibility of our Group Head of ESG  Risk and Compliance  we are now fully committed to our CSR approach. We will soon present our objectives  focusing on our societal role with young people  our safety and diversity commitments for employees  and our carbon reduction targets.During this general meeting  to prepare for the group’s expansion in the medium term  we have broadened the skills and expertise of our supervisory board and reorganized our management board. With its more diverse skill set  our supervisory board will be better equipped to fulfill its advisory and oversight roles. Our management board is now more agile and surrounded by an enlarged executive committee of experts. This reorganized team will soon be charting the course that will bring us to €2.5 billion in revenue in the medium term.”Five years of transformation that have brought Solutions30 to €1 billion in revenueIn 20 years  Solutions30 has grown from a small business to an international corporation that is on track to reach €1 billion in revenue in 2023. To support such fast-paced growth  Solutions30 has strengthened its compliance  risk management  and ESG standards:Strengthening of the risk management  internal control  and compliance policyStarting in 2022  Solutions30 began defining new control processes and creating a risks and internal control system manual. To ensure that these procedures are properly implemented  and more broadly to reinforce group compliance  Solutions30 has appointed Nathalie Duchesne as Group Head of ESG  Risk and Compliance. She has begun training and raising the awareness of all employees about these topics  implemented control processes in each country and department  and gathered relevant information to better inform the decisions of the Management Board. She works with a dedicated network of local contacts in the departments of each country.Simplification of the legal organization chartIn less than five years  Solutions30 has carried out a comprehensive legal simplification program to facilitate its internal control  eliminating nearly 50 legal entities  mainly through intra-group restructuring.Systematic control of the company’s subcontractorsSolutions30 has implemented a new third-party verification policy and appointed a dedicated team of eight people to carry out systematic checks on its subcontractors. This approach relies on the subcontractor sourcing platform the group set up in 2021  mySupplace  which currently includes 3 000 partner companies. This collaborative platform also serves as the group’s compliance tool  allowing documents supplied by these companies to be verified  analyzed  and archived.New governanceOver the past five years  Solutions30 has strengthened and broadened the skills of all its management bodies (Supervisory Board  Management Board  and Executive Committee)  with more than 50% of their members being newly appointed. In recent years  the Supervisory Board has welcomed five new members  out of seven  each bringing to the table extensive expertise in finance  auditing  compliance  ESG  and corporate strategy.At the same time  Solutions30 has strengthened its codes of conduct and anti-corruption policy  while focusing on team training and awareness. A whistleblowing platform  which has proven its effectiveness at resolving situations  ensures that all weak signals  misconduct  non-compliance  or internal risks get reported.Building a CSR approachSince 2019  Solutions30 has been committed to CSR (corporate social responsibility) that is aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. In 2022  the group stepped up this commitment by changing the “Strategy” committee to the “Strategy and ESG” committee  making ESG a core part of the group’s roadmap. The ESG strategy  objectives  and performance indicators were overhauled to make them more transparent  and the group is currently working on a carbon footprint project using the GHG Protocol to improve how it measures CO2 emissions. The results of this work will be communicated in the near future.In terms of employee safety  Solutions30 has initiated a review of procedures aimed at preventing work-related accidents and illnesses  raised awareness among employees on how to reduce their exposure to risk  and trained teams in ethics and compliance.For its social commitments  Solutions30 has a yearslong recruitment  skills development  and vocational training policy designed to help young people  some of whom have dropped out of school  to land their first job. The policy also helps people in the process of changing careers by training them for positions in the digital and energy professions of the future. In 2022  Solutions30 recruited 924 young people under the age of 30  representing 40% of new hires and up to 21% of the entire workforce. More than 180 000 hours of training  or 25 hours per employee  were provided in 2022 in promising technical fields or in training modules on interpersonal skills and customer service.The group is also working towards gender equality by giving women a more central role  with the aim of increasing the number of women in managerial positions by more than 10% in 2023 and achieving equal pay for men and women. The addition of Paola Bruno to the Supervisory Board brings the proportion of women on this governance body to 43%.Solutions30 enters a new phase of growth and changes dimensionWith its solid structure and strengthened governance  Solutions30 is poised to enter a new phase in its history and is ready to scale accordingly.To meet the market’s needs  customer expectations  and the challenges of its ongoing transformation  Solutions30 now relies on three complementary bodies: (i) a Supervisory Board with enhanced powers to fulfill its oversight role  (ii) a Management Board limited to four members  which keeps the group agile  streamlines decision-making  and conserves its strong growth momentum  and (iii) an expanded Excom that includes support functions and country heads  all of whom work in close collaboration with the Management Board.A Supervisory Board with strengthened and diversified competences to meet the demands of its oversight roleWith today’s approval of Paola Bruno’s nomination  the Supervisory Board now comprises 7 members  all of whom are independent:Three long-standing members  who joined before the 2018-2023 period  to guarantee the stability of the group’s governance: Alexander Sator  Caroline Tissot  and Jean-Paul Cottet. Their intricate knowledge of Solutions30 and its objectives for the next 5 years puts them in an ideal position to offer strategic advice for the company’s future.Three recently appointed members  who have brought new ideas to the board and broadened its expertise in finance  audit  risk and compliance: Thomas Kremer  appointed in 2022  who brings his legal and corporate governance expertise as well as his knowledge of data protection  compliance  and risk management; Yves Kerveillant and Pascale Mourvillier  who bring their expertise in corporate finance and auditing.One new member  Paola Bruno  with 30 years’ experience in investment banking  who once again strengthens the diversity and skills of the Supervisory Board with her background in market finance  corporate finance and strategy  investor relations  and compliance  especially in times of crisis. Her experience in both Italy and the United Kingdom  two key markets for the group  is an important asset and preserves the complementarity of international experience among Supervisory Board members.Forty-three percent of the Supervisory Board members are now female  which brings the group into compliance with the European “Women on Boards” Directive  ahead of its transposition into Luxembourg law.To help the Supervisory Board oversee the group’s commitments  the audit and strategy committees have been expanded to cover risk management  compliance  and ESG. These committees have been renamed the Audit  Risk and Compliance Committee and the Strategy and ESG Committee.A smaller Management Board with an expanded Excom for agile  streamlined performanceComprising four members with in-depth knowledge of the company  the Management Board continues to be headed by Gianbeppi Fortis  Solutions30’s founding CEO  who defines and steers the group’s strategy.
