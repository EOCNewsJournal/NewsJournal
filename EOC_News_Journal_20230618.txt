You can’t skirt the rule of law. And if you find something that is legally tenable what are the implications for the euro’s standing as a global currency?” an unnamed EU diplomat told the newspaper. He added that the commission is finalizing proposals on the potential tapping of frozen Russian assets  which are expected to be unveiled later this month.EU securities depositories have seized some €196.6 billion ($215 billion) in Russian assets since the start of the conflict  the news outlet noted  adding that Belgium-based Euroclear alone generated €734 million ($805 million) of interest on cash balances from Russia-sanctioned assets in the first quarter of 2023.In total  Western governments have frozen about $300 billion in Russian central bank assets since the start of Russia’s military operation in Ukraine  and seized more than $80 billion worth of assets belonging to Russian citizens and businesses. While addressing the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF) on Friday  Russian President Vladimir Putin described these actions as “medieval.”“Many businessmen were stunned to see that their accounts in the West were frozen. It never crossed anyone’s mind. This is robbery. They closed them  took them away and won’t even explain why. It’s shocking. It’s like the Middle Ages ” the Russian president said.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section,negative,0.0,0.01,0.99,negative,0.0,0.11,0.89,True,English,"['EU politicians', 'Russian money', 'ECB', 'profits', 'FT', 'St. Petersburg International Economic Forum', 'The European Central Bank', 'Russian President Vladimir Putin', 'Russian central bank assets', 'other central banks', 'draft internal note', 'huge reconstruction bill', 'large forex reserves', 'frozen Russian assets', 'unnamed EU diplomat', 'EU securities depositories', 'Russian citizens', 'European Commission', 'Russia-sanctioned assets', 'EU lawmakers', 'financial regulator', 'global currency', 'Financial Times', 'governing council', 'G7 countries', 'right thing', 'potential tapping', 'news outlet', 'Belgium-based Euroclear', 'cash balances', 'first quarter', 'Western governments', 'military operation', '$80 billion worth', 'Many businessmen', 'Middle Ages', 'business section', 'joint move', 'confidence', 'ECB', 'Friday', 'interest', 'ways', 'proceeds', 'restoration', 'Ukraine', 'conflict', 'report', 'actions', 'back', 'disagreement', 'rule', 'something', 'implications', 'newspaper', 'proposals', 'start', 'businesses', 'SPIEF', 'accounts', 'mind', 'robbery', 'stories', 'economy', 'finance']",2023-06-17,2023-06-18,rt.com
