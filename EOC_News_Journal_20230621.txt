Cagliari  June 19  2023 Outcome of today's board meeting The Board of Directors of Tessellis S.p.A. (""Tessellis"" or the ""Company"")  meeting today  approved the amendment of certain terms of the Issuer's capital increase resolution passed on May 11  2023. The Board deemed it appropriate to amend the previous resolution in order  on the one hand  to take into account the conversion into shares of 20 bonds of the convertible bond with Nice&Green  as well as  on the other hand  to allow a broader adherence to the transaction by its shareholders considering the performance of Tessellis stock recorded on the Euronext Milan market subsequent to the date of the initial resolution (May 11 2023). Specifically  by virtue of today's resolution  the maximum amount of the capital increase was set at Euro 24 716 036.00 (the ""Capital Increase by Option"")  to be implemented through the issuance of a maximum of 61 790 090 new shares (the ""Offered Shares"") to be offered under option to Shareholders pursuant to Article 2441  paragraph 1  of the Civil Code (the ""Offering""). The subscription price of the Offered Shares has been set at EUR 0.40 per share  applying a discount to the TERP (Theoretical ex right price) of 1.66%%  calculated on the average stock market price of Tessellis shares in the week prior to today's date. The option ratio is 1 new Tessellis share for every 3 option rights referred to the shares held. It should be noted that this capital increase is derived from the partial exercise of the broader proxy for a maximum of €60 million granted to the Board by the January 2023 Shareholders' Meeting  which will remain valid for the excess portion. For further details  please refer to the Explanatory Report  prepared pursuant to Article 72 and in accordance with Outline No. 2 of Annex 3A of CONSOB Regulation No. 11971 of May 14  1999  as amended and supplemented  available on the Company's website at www.tessellis.it. Timetable of the Option Offer The Board of Directors of Tessellis also approved the final timetable of the Offering  according to which the option rights valid for the subscription of the Offered Shares (the ""Option Rights"") must be exercised  under penalty of forfeiture  from June 26  2023 to July 10  2023  ends included (the ""Offering Period"") and will be tradable on Euronext Milan from June 26  2023 to July 4  2023  ends included.

Underwriting commitments Tessellis S.p.A. informs that today the Company has received a letter from the controlling shareholder OPNET S.p.A. - which follows the one already received on June 13  2023 - in which the latter has irrevocably committed itself  for an additional amount of Euro 7 million  to subscribe shares arising from the Capital Increase. With this additional commitment  OPNET guarantees the full subscription of its share of the Capital Increase itself  totaling approximately 14 million euros. Specifically  the underwriting commitment is subject to the following conditions: (i) that the subscription price does not exceed Euro 0.50 per share; and (ii) that OPNET obtains authorization for the completion of the transaction from its lender banks  pursuant to its existing agreements with them. Should the second of the above conditions occur by the end of the offering period  OPNET will fulfill its commitment by partially subscribing to the option rights to which it is entitled. Should  on the other hand  the banks' authorization be received after the end of the offering period (and by the deadline for the execution of the capital increase  i.e. July 31  2023)  OPNET will subscribe to any shares remaining unoptioned as a result of the stock market offering of the option rights pursuant to Article 2441(3) of the Civil Code. In this case  the commitment letter stipulates that the subscription of the shares will take place by the second open market day following the fulfillment of the condition. In addition  OPNET has reserved the right to have the second tranche of 7 million  which is the subject of the commitment letter received today  subscribed by one or more of its shareholders  while still guaranteeing its subscription to the Company. OPNET's underwriting commitment is not supported by guarantees. Also today  the Company received an irrevocable commitment from Guglielmo Leonardo Tabacchi  an entrepreneur in the finance and telecommunications sector  to subscribe to a portion of the shares arising from the Capital Increase.

CBOT wheat lost 1.6% to $6.76-3/4 a bushel.U.S. markets were closed on Monday for the Juneteenth holiday.Expanding drought in the U.S. Midwest has raised doubts over the USDA's forecasts for record U.S. corn and soybean production this year.Weather forecasts suggested greater chances of significant rain next week across the Midwest  with only light showers seen this week.""The weather remains a key concern for traders "" consultancy Agritel said in a note. ""The hydric deficit remains in both the north of the EU and the U.S. Corn Belt.""Grain markets were watching to see how U.S. participants would react to latest weather projections during the daytime session in Chicago later on Tuesday  traders said.In Europe  wheat futures on Euronext shed about 2%  pressured by expectations that cheaper Russian wheat would be used to cover most of a tender purchase by Algeria.Large Russian exports have tempered worries over the possible breakdown of a Black Sea corridor agreement allowing shipments from war-torn Ukraine  which Moscow has repeatedly threatened to quit next month.Weekend showers in France and widespread rain forecast this week have also eased concerns about dry conditions across northern Europe.

With WALLIX IDaaS  the corporate IT team no longer needs to handle application password reset requests. Identity federation is easily achieved from an onsite or cloud directory. Creating and managing access authorizations and user lifecycles is equally straightforward. This allows the IT staff to focus on value-added tasks  as it frees up their time from managing these routine activities.By signing a partnership with distributor Cris Réseaux  WALLIX is strengthening its marketing efforts for WALLIX IDaaS. Cris Réseaux excels in reaching a large number of resellers and Managed Service Providers (MSPs)  which are crucial for WALLIX's success. MSPs represent a significant opportunity for growth and align with the objectives of the Unicorn 25 plan and future years. Another advantage of Cris Réseaux is their well-established technical expertise. Over the past 25 years  they have been supporting resellers and  for the past 10 years  MSPs in launching and expanding their businesses in France  including the selection and training of distributed solutions. The extensive network and market coverage of Cris Réseaux  which aligns with WALLIX's mid-market target  undoubtedly serve as catalysts for the growth of WALLIX IDaaS.With a widespread presence across France  Cris Réseaux operates through 7 agencies and offers a catalog predominantly comprised of French and European products. This enables resellers to establish their presence in public markets. For WALLIX  the inclusion of the public orders is crucial for the growth of the European cybersecurity market. It is a matter of autonomy and freedom for all. It is imperative that public funds are primarily invested in our European offerings  with minimum quotas allocated to SMEs  and ideally  the establishment of a European Buy Act.""The partnership with Cris Réseaux opens up a new market for WALLIX and allows us to target a large number of resellers close to small and medium-sized companies  who will benefit from our expertise. Cris Réseaux's ability to propose combined offers from its product catalog represents value-added sales opportunities for local resellers. Their success in bringing the WALLIX IDaas offer to as many people as possible will also ensure our collective success "" explains Laurent Gentil  Channel Director at WALLIX .""This partnership with WALLIX aligns with our objective of providing an end-to-end sovereign offering. Our partners are increasingly connecting via secure links  notably through VPNs. With WALLIX IDaaS  we can authenticate and certify individuals authorized to access the company's sensitive resources. Our partners seek a comprehensive  sovereign  and interconnected solution to meet all their customers' requirements. Today  MFA/SSO  and perhaps tomorrow  a broader WALLIX offering..."" concludes Frederic MASCLET  Managing Director of Cris Réseaux.ABOUT CRIS RÉSEAUXCris Réseaux  a national value-added distributor since 1997  offers a range of cybersecurity solutions focusing on two major areas: the MSP model and digital sovereignty.

Global Bioenergies' fuel can now be blended up to 50% with fossil kerosene in existing airplanes.As a reminder  the airline industry requires the fuel used in airplanes to be ASTM certified. SAF are certified worldwide through the ASTM D7566 standard  which describes the fuel specification requirements and the maximum blending percentage with conventional fuels. This standard allows them to be considered as 'drop-in' fuels  which means they can be used safely in existing airplanes and infrastructures worldwide. The inclusion of new SAF production processes in the ASTM standard requires an in-depth assessment of the fuel's performance  after which a voting procedure is launched.The voting process has now been successfully completed after consultation of the ASTM main committee. The updated ASTM D7566 standard will be published in the coming weeks.Marc Delcourt  Co-founder and CEO of Global Bioenergies  comments: ""This positive vote is a tremendous recognition for Global Bioenergies and we thank the SkyNRG team for their great support in this ambitious process over the last years. It comes at a time when Europe has just adopted the RefuelEU plan  which aims at gradually increasing the production and incorporation of SAF  from 2% in 2025 to 6% in 2030 and up to 70% by 2050. To date  SAF represent only 0.1% of aviation fuels. This ambition is based on the construction of a very large number of plants. The target of 2% by 2025 will be reached thanks to emerging technologies based on waste oil. Subsequent targets will have to be based on the commercial success of innovative technologies like ours. »Maarten van Dijk  Co-founder and Chief Development Officer at SkyNRG states: “Reaching the SAF certification for Global Bioenergies’ process is a great achievement for both our teams and a perfect example of what is needed to drive innovation and build a more sustainable aviation industry. To reach net zero emissions  the industry now needs solid partnerships to realise the increase in production capacity. These include partners who commit to meaningful SAF offtakes  investors that recognize the importance of SAF in their portfolio and are willing to fund projects  and visionary leaders and governments who recognize and can address the investment hurdles that remain.”A press conference will take place on Thursday 22nd June at 10am at the Paris Air Show  at the Région Ile-de-France chalet (site 102).Please record your participation as a journalist at:pressconfSAF@global-bioenergies.comContactsGLOBAL BIOENERGIESinvest@global-bioenergies.com01 64 98 20 50 PRESS RELATIONSIva Baytchevaibaytcheva@ulysse-communication.com06 28 59 07 03Nicolas Danielsndaniels@ulysse-communication.com06 63 66 59 22About GLOBAL BIOENERGIESGlobal Bioenergies converts plant-derived resources into compounds used in the cosmetics industry  as well as the energy and materials sectors.

Global Bi…,"Global Bioenergies' SAF technologyreceives ASTM certificationLe Bourget  20 June 2023: Global Bioenergies' process becomes one of the very few Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) technologies in the world certified by ASTM International. Global Bioenergies' fuel can now be blended up to 50% with fossil kerosene in existing airplanes.As a reminder  the airline industry requires the fuel used in airplanes to be ASTM certified. SAF are certified worldwide through the ASTM D7566 standard  which describes the fuel specification requirements and the maximum blending percentage with conventional fuels. This standard allows them to be considered as 'drop-in' fuels  which means they can be used safely in existing airplanes and infrastructures worldwide. The inclusion of new SAF production processes in the ASTM standard requires an in-depth assessment of the fuel's performance  after which a voting procedure is launched.The voting process has now been successfully completed after consultation of the ASTM main committee. The updated ASTM D7566 standard will be published in the coming weeks.Marc Delcourt  Co-founder and CEO of Global Bioenergies  comments: ""This positive vote is a tremendous recognition for Global Bioenergies and we thank the SkyNRG team for their great support in this ambitious process over the last years. It comes at a time when Europe has just adopted the RefuelEU plan  which aims at gradually increasing the production and incorporation of SAF  from 2% in 2025 to 6% in 2030 and up to 70% by 2050. To date  SAF represent only 0.1% of aviation fuels. This ambition is based on the construction of a very large number of plants. The target of 2% by 2025 will be reached thanks to emerging technologies based on waste oil. Subsequent targets will have to be based on the commercial success of innovative technologies like ours. »Maarten van Dijk  Co-founder and Chief Development Officer at SkyNRG states: “Reaching the SAF certification for Global Bioenergies’ process is a great achievement for both our teams and a perfect example of what is needed to drive innovation and build a more sustainable aviation industry. To reach net zero emissions  the industry now needs solid partnerships to realise the increase in production capacity. These include partners who commit to meaningful SAF offtakes  investors that recognize the importance of SAF in their portfolio and are willing to fund projects  and visionary leaders and governments who recognize and can address the investment hurdles that remain.”A press conference will take place on Thursday 22nd June at 10am at the Paris Air Show  at the Région Ile-de-France chalet (site 102).Please record your participation as a journalist at:pressconfSAF@global-bioenergies.comContactsGLOBAL BIOENERGIESinvest@global-bioenergies.com01 64 98 20 50 PRESS RELATIONSIva Baytchevaibaytcheva@ulysse-communication.com06 28 59 07 03Nicolas Danielsndaniels@ulysse-communication.com06 63 66 59 22About GLOBAL BIOENERGIESGlobal Bioenergies converts plant-derived resources into compounds used in the cosmetics industry  as well as the energy and materials sectors.

Developing this next-generation engine demands efficient project management and quick and flexible decisionmaking. MTU Aero Engines and Safran Helicopter Engines have therefore forged a strong alliance that will form the core of an extended European partnership involving industrial partners from several other European nations.""This alliance project led by Safran Helicopter Engines and MTU Aero Engines is set to ensure European sovereignty for the ENGRT project""  said Cédric Goubet  CEO of Safran Helicopter Engines. ""The engine design will be perfectly adaptable to the future helicopter requirements  while incorporating breakthrough technologies such as hybrid-electric propulsion. It will be one of the most important collaborative programs in the history of European defense. Safran Helicopter Engines and MTU have long-standing experiences in leading joint industrial ventures  thereby conducive to the success of this new alliance.""Michael Schreyögg  Chief Program Officer of MTU Aero Engines commented: ""This future-oriented program is key to further reinforcing European sovereignty  strengthening the European supply chain and fostering collaboration between MTU and our long-standing partner Safran. It marks another milestone in Europe's defense history. The ambition to power the next-generation military helicopter complements our companies' already established joint initiative to power the next-generation fighter within the FCAS program. Both strategic partners shape the future by maintaining strong relationships and involving partners across Europe.""One of the main goals of this collaboration is to favor a future specific call for military helicopter engines in the European Defense Fund (EDF). Safran Helicopter Engines and MTU Aero Engines would then respond together with a capable consortium of partners.The ENGRT project will explore technology options anticipating the next generation of military rotorcraft slated to enter service by 2040. The project will analyze future military requirements in this area in cooperation with European armed forces. Concepts of potential operations will be defined and tested using simulation tools. Different configurations of rotary wings will be studied: conventional  convertible or hybrid helicopters. Operational simulations will be set up to evaluate these options and the different mission scenarios. The project will also lead to the establishment of a roadmap and strategy regarding the modularity of future platforms  the maturation of required technologies  production methods  life-cycle costs and maintenance concepts.Safran is an international high-technology group  operating in the aviation (propulsion  equipment and interiors)  defense and space markets.

Sanofi announces that in an International Chamber of Commerce dispute  the tribunal dismissed BI’s indemnification claim against Sanofi and confirmed that Sanofi shall not be liable to indemnify BI for any potential losses in relation to the ongoing Zantac litigation in the U.S. This decision is final and non-appealable.Importantly  Sanofi remains confident that the defense of the underlying U.S. Zantac litigation is very strong. There is no reliable scientific evidence that Zantac causes the alleged injuries in the cases brought against GSK  Pfizer  BI  Sanofi  and others in the U.S. litigation. The FDA and the European Medicines Agency have both evaluated the available data and found no evidence that ranitidine  the active ingredient contained in Zantac  causes cancer.This was notably confirmed in December 2022  when a U.S. federal court assigned to oversee all federal cases in the United States (“MDL”) ruled that plaintiffs had no reliable scientific evidence that ranitidine can cause any of the plaintiffs’ alleged injuries. The thorough ruling substantiated Sanofi’s scientific defenses demonstrating that there is no reliable evidence of causation for even those cancer types that plaintiffs claimed had the strongest evidence. Sanofi believes that any appeal by plaintiffs of the MDL ruling has a low probability of success. Tens of thousands of claimants who were once a part of this MDL litigation chose to abandon their claims or else withdrew early from the MDL  either filing in state court or not re-filing at all. These recent events have significantly decreased the potential scope of the litigation.BackgroundZantac was launched in the United States as a prescription medication by GSK in 1983 (GSK continued to market the Rx version until 2017). In 1995  GSK launched an OTC version of its Zantac 75mg formula. In 1997  generic ranitidine entered the market. In 1998  Pfizer acquired the OTC rights and in 2004 it launched a 150mg version of the product as well. In 2006  BI acquired the U.S. OTC rights for Zantac and in January 2017 Sanofi acquired those OTC rights.On September 13  2019  FDA issued a statement alerting the public that some ranitidine medicines  including over-the-counter Zantac  contained a nitrosamine impurity called N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) at low levels. NDMA is a known environmental contaminant found in drinking water  soil  and common foods  including meats  dairy products  and vegetables. People are routinely exposed to small amounts of NDMA every day.In October 2019  out of an abundance of caution Sanofi issued a voluntary recall of all ranitidine Zantac OTC products in the U.S. and Canada.Since that time  the medical  scientific  and regulatory communities have extensively evaluated the safety of Zantac’s active ingredient ranitidine  and the data show there is no evidence of consumer harm from real-world use of Zantac. Over time  both FDA and the European Medicines Agency have evaluated the available data and have also found no evidence that ranitidine causes cancer.Regardless of the scientific evidence  within days of FDA’s September 2019 announcement  purported class actions and personal injury lawsuits were filed in U.S. courts  alleging that Zantac caused various cancers. In addition to Sanofi  these lawsuits named GSK  Pfizer  BI  dozens of generic manufacturers  retailers and pharmaceutical distributors.The arbitration dispute arose from contractual indemnification obligations agreed between Sanofi and BI as part of the January 2017 swap of Sanofi’s Animal Health business for BI’s Consumer Health Care business.There is no evidence of consumer harm from real-world use of Zantac as a result of any NDMA contamination.Sanofi stands by the safety of Zantac. Given the lack of scientific support for plaintiffs’ claims  Sanofi remains fully confident in its defenses to the litigation. Sanofi acted responsibly at all times.About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives.

The decision follows a planned interim analysis of the first dose cohort by an Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) meeting held on June 19  2023.“We are encouraged by the favorable safety profile and early efficacy signals from the ARDA study  as well as the IDMC recommendation to advance the study to the next cohort. Looking forward  we hope to build on the promising safety and efficacy we observed in the first cohort while populating our PK/PD model to understand the full potential of empasiprubart in MMN ” commented Luc Truyen  M.D.  Ph.D.  Chief Medical Officer  argenx. “People living with MMN continue to face significant burden associated with this chronic autoimmune disease  including progressive muscle weakness  which can lead to an inability to walk or move one’s arms or hands. Our mission is to transform treatment paradigms for autoimmune patients by changing expectations on what well-controlled means. Based on these data  we are hopeful that we can accomplish this in MMN and other autoimmune indications with our first-in-class C2 inhibitor.”The IDMC reviewed interim safety data from all patients (n=22) currently enrolled in the first cohort of the ARDA study  including nine patients who completed the full 16-week treatment period. The IDMC confirmed a favorable safety and tolerability profile of empasiprubart consistent with results from the Phase 1 study and recommended advancing to the second cohort. An early efficacy assessment of all 22 patients supports proof-of-concept of empasiprubart in MMN. The data showed distinct separation between treated patients and placebo based on a suite of clinical outcome measures  including time to IVIg retreatment.In total  the ARDA study is expected to enroll 48 patients across two cohorts. The study’s objective  in addition to assessing safety and efficacy of empasiprubart  is to populate a PK/PD model to inform the Phase 3 study dose selection. Based on the IDMC recommendation to continue enrollment  argenx will aim to build on the promising efficacy and safety observations from the first cohort by evaluating a next dose level of empasiprubart.Phase 2 ARDA Study DesignThe Phase 2 ARDA study is a randomized  double-blinded  placebo-controlled multicenter study to evaluate the safety and tolerability  efficacy  pharmacokinetics  pharmacodynamics  and immunogenicity of two dose regimens of empasiprubart in adults with multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN). The study consists of an IVIg dependency and monitoring period and two 16-week treatment cohorts of 24 MMN patients receiving empasiprubart or placebo in a 2x1 randomization. The dosing for Cohort 2 will be established after a planned interim analysis of the first nine patients to complete the 16-week treatment period from Cohort 1. The primary endpoint is safety and tolerability. Additional endpoints include time to IVIg retreatment  biomarker analyses of C2 levels  and changes in measurements on key clinical efficacy scores (modified medical research council (mMRC)-14 sum score  grip strength  MMN-RODS) as well as several patient-reported quality of life outcome measures.About EmpasiprubartEmpasiprubart (ARGX-117) is a first-in-class humanized sweeping antibody that binds specifically to C2 thereby blocking both the classical and lectin pathways of the complement cascade. By blocking upstream complement activity  empasiprubart has the potential to reduce tissue inflammation representing a broad pipeline opportunity across multiple severe autoimmune indications. In addition to multifocal motor neuropathy  argenx is planning to evaluate empasiprubart in delayed graft function following kidney transplant and dermatomyositis.About Multifocal Motor NeuropathyMultifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) is a rare  chronic autoimmune disease of the peripheral nervous system. The disease is characterized by slowly progressive  asymmetric muscle weakness mainly of the hands  forearms and lower legs. MMN is often associated with anti-GM1 IgM autoimmunity  leading to activation of the classical complement pathway  driving subsequent axon damage. High-dose IV immunoglobulin (IVIg) is the only approved treatment for MMN and patients typically experience disease progression despite therapy  indicating an unmet need for efficacious and better tolerated therapeutic options.About argenxargenx is a global immunology company committed to improving the lives of people suffering from severe autoimmune diseases. Partnering with leading academic researchers through its Immunology Innovation Program (IIP)  argenx aims to translate immunology breakthroughs into a world-class portfolio of novel antibody-based medicines. argenx developed and is commercializing the first-and- only approved neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) blocker in the U.S.  Japan  the EU and the UK. The Company is evaluating efgartigimod in multiple serious autoimmune diseases and advancing several earlier stage experimental medicines within its therapeutic franchises.

26463,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/06/20/2690713/0/en/Press-Release-Sanofi-prevails-in-Zantac-arbitration-initiated-by-Boehringer-Ingelheim.html,Press Release: Sanofi prevails in Zantac arbitration initiated by Boehringer Ingelheim,Sanofi prevails in Zantac arbitration initiated by Boehringer Ingelheim   Arbitral tribunal dismisses claim brought by Boehringer Ingelheim (“BI”)......,English FrenchSanofi prevails in Zantac arbitration initiated by Boehringer IngelheimArbitral tribunal dismisses claim brought by Boehringer Ingelheim (“BI”) against Sanofi for indemnification of potential liabilities related to the ongoing Zantac litigation in the U.S. ; decision is final and cannot be appealedKey U.S. federal court ruling in December 2022 found no reliable evidence that Zantac causes the alleged injuries  bolstered similar findings by FDA and EMA; tens of thousands of claimants have abandoned their claimsSanofi remains highly confident in defense of underlying U.S. Zantac litigation as confirmed by developments over the last 6 monthsParis  June 20  2023. Sanofi announces that in an International Chamber of Commerce dispute  the tribunal dismissed BI’s indemnification claim against Sanofi and confirmed that Sanofi shall not be liable to indemnify BI for any potential losses in relation to the ongoing Zantac litigation in the U.S. This decision is final and non-appealable.Importantly  Sanofi remains confident that the defense of the underlying U.S. Zantac litigation is very strong. There is no reliable scientific evidence that Zantac causes the alleged injuries in the cases brought against GSK  Pfizer  BI  Sanofi  and others in the U.S. litigation. The FDA and the European Medicines Agency have both evaluated the available data and found no evidence that ranitidine  the active ingredient contained in Zantac  causes cancer.This was notably confirmed in December 2022  when a U.S. federal court assigned to oversee all federal cases in the United States (“MDL”) ruled that plaintiffs had no reliable scientific evidence that ranitidine can cause any of the plaintiffs’ alleged injuries. The thorough ruling substantiated Sanofi’s scientific defenses demonstrating that there is no reliable evidence of causation for even those cancer types that plaintiffs claimed had the strongest evidence. Sanofi believes that any appeal by plaintiffs of the MDL ruling has a low probability of success. Tens of thousands of claimants who were once a part of this MDL litigation chose to abandon their claims or else withdrew early from the MDL  either filing in state court or not re-filing at all. These recent events have significantly decreased the potential scope of the litigation.BackgroundZantac was launched in the United States as a prescription medication by GSK in 1983 (GSK continued to market the Rx version until 2017). In 1995  GSK launched an OTC version of its Zantac 75mg formula. In 1997  generic ranitidine entered the market. In 1998  Pfizer acquired the OTC rights and in 2004 it launched a 150mg version of the product as well. In 2006  BI acquired the U.S. OTC rights for Zantac and in January 2017 Sanofi acquired those OTC rights.On September 13  2019  FDA issued a statement alerting the public that some ranitidine medicines  including over-the-counter Zantac  contained a nitrosamine impurity called N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) at low levels. NDMA is a known environmental contaminant found in drinking water  soil  and common foods  including meats  dairy products  and vegetables. People are routinely exposed to small amounts of NDMA every day.In October 2019  out of an abundance of caution Sanofi issued a voluntary recall of all ranitidine Zantac OTC products in the U.S. and Canada.Since that time  the medical  scientific  and regulatory communities have extensively evaluated the safety of Zantac’s active ingredient ranitidine  and the data show there is no evidence of consumer harm from real-world use of Zantac. Over time  both FDA and the European Medicines Agency have evaluated the available data and have also found no evidence that ranitidine causes cancer.Regardless of the scientific evidence  within days of FDA’s September 2019 announcement  purported class actions and personal injury lawsuits were filed in U.S. courts  alleging that Zantac caused various cancers. In addition to Sanofi  these lawsuits named GSK  Pfizer  BI  dozens of generic manufacturers  retailers and pharmaceutical distributors.The arbitration dispute arose from contractual indemnification obligations agreed between Sanofi and BI as part of the January 2017 swap of Sanofi’s Animal Health business for BI’s Consumer Health Care business.There is no evidence of consumer harm from real-world use of Zantac as a result of any NDMA contamination.Sanofi stands by the safety of Zantac. Given the lack of scientific support for plaintiffs’ claims  Sanofi remains fully confident in its defenses to the litigation. Sanofi acted responsibly at all times.About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives.

In this regard  the Group has made significant progress to date with €4.7 Bn of disposals completed since December 2020  including €3.3 Bn in Europe and $1.6 Bn in the US.This progress has been recognized by rating agencies  which have kept the Group’s ratings (BBB+/Baa2) and stable outlook unchanged in their FY2022 reviews.Maintaining a solid capital structure  including the hybrid  is key to achieving URW’s strategic objectives in the best conditions within today’s challenging financing environment.The Group’s strong operating performance and ample liquidity1 enables it to continue to act on its deleveraging plan in a timely and orderly manner. The strength of URW’s portfolio is demonstrated by the post-Covid recovery in both sales and footfall  and sustained demand from retailers for highly-productive space as part of their omnichannel strategy. The assets also offer a hedge against inflation through indexation and variable rents.On completion of the deleveraging plan  URW will have a Europe-focused portfolio of high-quality  sustainable  and high-performing assets located in the continent’s wealthiest cities and most dynamic catchment areas.The Existing Bonds and Exchange OfferHybrid instruments are an important component of URW’s capital structure. The instruments support the Group’s ratings and the delivery of its stated strategy and deleveraging plan.After careful evaluation of the current restrictive hybrid primary market conditions  the Group has decided not to exercise its option to call the Existing Notes.Understanding the impact of this decision on fixed income investors and considering the interest of all its stakeholders  the Group has decided to offer an alternative to remaining invested in the Existing Notes. Accordingly  the Group is today announcing an any-and-all par-for-par Exchange Offer in respect of the Existing Notes into a combination of (i) new hybrid notes with a coupon of 7.25%  and (ii) a Cash Amount (where applicable). The Cash Amount will result in a reduction of the Group’s overall hybrid portfolio  and will not exceed €200 Mn i.e. 10% of the outstanding aggregate hybrid portfolio.The Exchange Offer is subject to achieving a minimum new issue size of €500 Mn to ensure the liquidity of the New Notes for investors.In accordance with the terms and conditions  the coupon of the Existing Notes not exchanged will reset on 25 October 2023 to the aggregate of the then prevailing 5-year Mid-Swap Rate and the Relevant Margin  which is 1.675% per annum.The Group expects its rating to be unchanged as a result of the completion of this transaction and the New Notes to be rated BBB- by S&P and Ba1 by Moody’s  two notches below URW’s issuer and senior unsecured ratings of BBB+/Baa2  in line with the existing hybrid instruments. Any portion of the Existing Notes that are not exchanged are expected to continue to benefit from Moody’s 50% equity credit whilst receiving a qualitative benefit from S&P.All other hybrid instruments (including the Perp-NC 2026 and the New Notes) are expected to continue to benefit from a 50% equity credit treatment with both rating agencies.

In two recent publications  the company has demonstrated that adding copper improved ATO’s reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated deletion of activated immune cells  among other action pathways. This increased efficacy could lead to an improved safety profile  and to new combination therapy approaches with advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMP). BioSenic is already evaluating an oral version of ATO (OATO) for systemic autoimmune indications  including an upcoming Phase III study in patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant.“The Redox Medicine Society conference has been running for 25 years  bringing together KOLs and renowned researchers from around the world to facilitate the translation of redox biology into medicine. The Redox Medicine Society congress is a source of fruitful encounters and scientific inspiration.” said Dr. Nicco. “We are excited to share our findings and hope that these data will inspire redox translational research to deliver more beneficial medicines.”Dr Nicco will present “Arsenic-Copper: A Double-Edged Sword for a Unique Double Benefit against Immunological Disorders” as part of Session 3 on Redox Medicine in Health & Diseases: Innovations  & Strategies  at 9:20 a.m. CEST on Friday  June 23  2023.About BioSenicBioSenic is a leading biotech company specializing in the development of clinical assets issued from: (i)  the allogeneic cell therapy platform ALLOB and (ii) the arsenic trioxide (ATO) platform. Key target indications for the platforms include graft-versus-host-disease (GvHD)  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  systemic sclerosis (SSc) and high-risk tibial fractures.Following the merger in October 2022  BioSenic combines the strategic positionings and strengths of Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics. The merger also enables Biosenic to add to its innovative cell therapy platform and strong IP for tissue repair protection with an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/oral ATO (OATO).BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About BioSenic technology platformsBioSenic’s technology is based on two main platforms:1) The allogeneic cell and gene therapy platform  developed by BioSenic with differentiated bone marrow sourced mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) that can be stored at the point-of-use in hospitals. Its current investigational medicinal product  ALLOB  represents a unique  proprietary approach to organ repair and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells at the site of injury after a single local injection. These cells are produced via BioSenic's scalable manufacturing process. Following the CTA approval by regulatory authorities in Europe  BioSenic has initiated patient recruitment for the Phase IIb clinical trial with ALLOB in patients with difficult tibial fractures  using its optimized production process. ALLOB is currently being evaluated in a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase IIb study in patients with high-risk tibial fractures  using its optimized production process  after a successful first safety and efficacy study (Phase 1/2a) on fractured long bones  with late-delayed union. Patient recruitment was halted in February 2023 with 57 patients and the new rules permitted for statistical analysis should allow BioSenic to get the main results of this trial much earlier than anticipated in the original protocol  expected by mid-2023.2) The arsenic trioxide (ATO) platform developed by Medsenic. The immunomodulatory properties of ATO have demonstrated a double basic effect on cells of the immune system. The first effect is the increase of the cell oxidative stress in activated B  T or other cells of the innate/adaptative immune system to the point they will enter a cell death program (apoptosis) and be eliminated. The second effect is potent immunomodulatory properties on several pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in inflammatory or autoimmune cell pathways. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) in its chronic  established stage. GvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). GvHD is primarily mediated by the transplanted immune system that can lead to severe multiorgan damage. Medsenic had been successful in a Phase II trial with its intravenous formulation  allowing ATO to be granted an orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA and is heading towards an international Phase III confirmatory study  with a new  IP protected  oral (OATO) formulation. Another selected disease target is moderate-to-severe forms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastrointestinal tract) in a Phase IIa study.Another part of the BioSenic’sclinical pipeline is systemic sclerosis. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models have been positive. This gives good grounds to launch a Phase II clinical protocol for this serious disease that badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  which has no current effective treatment.In addition  BioSenic is developing an off-the-shelf  next-generation improved viscosupplement  JTA-004  consisting of a unique combination of plasma proteins  hyaluronic acid (a natural component of knee synovial fluid)  and a fast-acting analgesic. JTA-004 is designed to provide added lubrication and protection to the cartilage of the arthritic joint  and to alleviate osteoarthritic (OA) pain and inflammation. In March 2023  after the identification of new OA subtypes  BioSenic delivered a new post-hoc analysis of its Phase III JTA-004 trial on knee OA with positive action on the most severely affected patient population. This new analysis changed the therapeutic profile of the molecule and allows for the possibility of stratifying patients for a new  optimized Phase III clinical study. BioSenic  which does not intend to allocate R&D resources to support the clinical development of JTA-004 and will continue to focus its R&D activities on the development of its autoimmune (ATO) and cell therapy (ALLOB) platforms  is now seeking to collaborate with existing and potential partners to explore options for the future development of JTA-004 based on this new post-hoc analysis.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAPr.

In two recent publications  the company has demonstrated that adding copper improved ATO's reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated deletion of activated immune cells  among other action pathways. This increased efficacy could lead to an improved safety profile  and to new combination therapy approaches with advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMP). BioSenic is already evaluating an oral version of ATO (OATO) for systemic autoimmune indications  including an upcoming Phase III study in patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant.""The Redox Medicine Society conference has been running for 25 years  bringing together KOLs and renowned researchers from around the world to facilitate the translation of redox biology into medicine. The Redox Medicine Society congress is a source of fruitful encounters and scientific inspiration."" said Dr. Nicco. ""We are excited to share our findings and hope that these data will inspire redox translational research to deliver more beneficial medicines.""Dr Nicco will present""Arsenic-Copper: A Double-Edged Sword for a Unique Double Benefit against ImmunologicalDisorders"" as part of Session 3 on Redox Medicine in Health & Diseases: Innovations  & Strategies  at 9:20 a.m. CEST on Friday  June 23  2023.About BioSenicBioSenic is a leading biotech company specializing in the development of clinical assets issued from: (i)  the allogeneic cell therapy platform ALLOB andthe arsenic trioxide (ATO) platform. Key target indications for the platforms include graft-versus-host-disease (GvHD)  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  systemic sclerosis (SSc) and high-risk tibial fractures.Following the merger in October 2022  BioSenic combines the strategic positionings and strengths of Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics. The merger also enables Biosenic to add to its innovative cell therapy platform and strong IP for tissue repair protection with an entirely new arsenal of various anti- inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/oral ATO (OATO).BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About BioSenic technology platformsBioSenic's technology is based on two main platforms:The allogeneic cell and gene therapy platform  developed by BioSenic with differentiated bone marrow sourced mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) that can be stored at the point-of-use in hospitals. Its current investigational medicinal product  ALLOB  represents a unique  proprietary approach to organ repair and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells at the site of injury after a single local injection. These cells are produced via BioSenic's scalable manufacturing process.
