Many of the funds are at settlement giant Euroclear Ltd.  where they generated nearly €750 million by the first quarter of this year.The bloc is expected to seek a mandate to work on this policy from EU leaders when they meet in Brussels next week.An EU working party on the use of Russian reserves frozen under the bloc’s sanctions has been discussing how to gather information and assessing options under EU and international law. Its members see “no credible legal avenue allowing for the confiscation of frozen or immobilized assets on the sole basis of these assets being under EU restrictive measures ” it concluded. Instead it favors channeling windfall profits from the investments to Ukraine.Read more: Seize  Not Just Freeze  Russian Assets? Why It’s Hard: QuickTakeAustrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg urged caution in an interview with Bloomberg Television on Wednesday. “I fully understand the emotionality of the debate and that we say we have to get our hands on these assets ” he said.“But we are rule-of-law states. We are defending a rules-based international order ” Schallenberg added. “So whatever we do in this endeavor has to be absolutely water-tight. It can be challenged  and it might be challenged in front of European or American courts. If any of these actions were to be lifted by a judge  it would be a diplomatic and economic disaster.”Several major global banks are concerned that appropriating Russian assets could cause Moscow to retaliate against their remaining interests in the country  according to people familiar with the matter. Russia could make life harder for foreign banks and target their local staff  an executive at one bank said. A second executive said his bank isn’t lobbying directly but is opposed in principle to confiscation by the EU.The European Central Bank has warned that using interest rate proceeds from the assets could encourage official reserve holders to turn their back on the euro  the report said. The central bank believes international coordination will play a key role in mitigating the risks.Read more: EU Blocks More Than €200 Billion in Russian Central Bank AssetsThe paper identified significant legal obstacles to one of the two options the bloc is exploring: temporarily using liquid assets of Russia’s central bank — in other words  investing the assets and directing the proceeds to Ukraine.The group preferred a second option: a so-called windfall contribution. Firms with Russian holdings that are generating large profits by investing them could be required to transfer a substantial amount to the EU. This could reduce legal risk for the bloc because the EU wouldn’t be managing them.EU officials wrote that this model wouldn’t affect financial stability  would preserve the business models of the firms involved and would be fair in terms of tax. “It would not impact the legal situation of the assets ” they added.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Wednesday in a speech to the Ukraine Recovery Conference in London that the bloc will come up with a proposal for using those holdings before its summer break in mid-July.‘Potential Magnitude’More than half the assets are in cash and deposits  while a “substantial amount” of the remainder is in securities that will transform to cash as they mature in the next two to three years.The commission informed the working group “of the potential magnitude of revenues” if these liquid assets were invested prudently.EU officials considered actively managing the assets to generate returns that could be used to support Ukraine. But property rights would need to be considered  and there is a risk of negative returns that couldn’t be completely eliminated  the report said.Overall  the paper describes the urgent need of pushing forward with the work and taking the lead internationally on the matter given that most central bank assets are in the EU. The bloc’s leaders are expected to take stock of the work done so far next week and ask that officials keep moving ahead on it  according to a draft statement seen by Bloomberg.--With assistance from Liza Tetley and Ott Tammik.(Updates with Schallenberg interview in fifth  sixth paragraphs)Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek©2023 Bloomberg L.P.,negative,0.01,0.4,0.59,mixed,0.22,0.1,0.68,True,English,"['Russian Assets', 'EU', 'Hurdles', '€200 Billion', 'European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen', 'next two to three years', 'Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg', 'frozen Russian central bank assets', 'settlement giant Euroclear Ltd.', 'Several major global banks', 'The European Central Bank', 'outright frozen Russian assets', 'most central bank assets', 'The European Union', 'official reserve holders', 'fifth, sixth paragraphs', 'rules-based international order', 'significant legal obstacles', 'interest rate proceeds', 'EU restrictive measures', 'Bloomberg L.P.', 'Ukraine Recovery Conference', 'EU working party', 'foreign banks', 'Russian reserves', 'one bank', 'two options', 'Russian holdings', 'international law', 'international coordination', 'legal avenue', 'legal situation', 'Schallenberg interview', 'first quarter', 'sole basis', 'windfall profits', 'law states', 'American courts', 'economic disaster', 'remaining interests', 'local staff', 'key role', 'liquid assets', 'other words', 'second option', 'windfall contribution', 'large profits', 'substantial amount', 'financial stability', 'business models', 'summer break', 'Potential Magnitude', 'working group', 'property rights', 'urgent need', 'draft statement', 'Liza Tetley', 'Ott Tammik', 'legal risk', 'Bloomberg Television', 'Bloomberg Businessweek', 'second executive', 'negative returns', 'EU officials', 'EU leaders', 'document', 'report', 'funds', 'bloc', 'mandate', 'policy', 'Brussels', 'use', 'sanctions', 'information', 'members', 'confiscation', 'investments', 'QuickTake', 'caution', 'Wednesday', 'emotionality', 'debate', 'hands', 'endeavor', 'front', 'actions', 'judge', 'diplomatic', 'Moscow', 'country', 'people', 'matter', 'life', 'principle', 'back', 'risks', 'paper', 'Firms', 'terms', 'tax', 'speech', 'London', 'proposal', 'mid-July', 'cash', 'deposits', 'remainder', 'securities', 'revenues', 'stock', 'assistance', 'Updates']",2023-06-21,2023-06-22,finance.yahoo.com
26481,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.politico.eu/article/brussels-to-go-after-russian-frozen-foreign-reserves/,Ballsy EU Commission moves to make Russia pay for Ukraine,The unprecedented move is controversial among some EU countries and the ECB  which think going it alone is too risky.,"LONDON — The European Commission has a plan to help pay for the reconstruction of war-torn Ukraine using Russian state assets. It's a daring move and a sign of a shift toward something that once looked impossible.It would be an unprecedented legal feat  one strongly advocated by Ukraine and its allies but which is already kicking up a storm among governments. The EU executive’s intention to throw its weight behind such a move — confirmed by Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Wednesday — will require some delicate politics over the next few months.The plan is fraught with political  legal and economic risks. It has consequences for the role of foreign reserves in stabilizing currencies  as well as for the international protection of state property — and potentially could be endlessly litigated in court. The idea of making the aggressor pay for war damages isn’t new  but to go after foreign reserves frozen under Western sanctions would be.“On one hand  it's a question of international laws that Russia  as an aggressor  is responsible to pay for damages it's creating ” EU Commission Executive Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis told POLITICO. “On the other hand  it's also a question of EU taxpayers' money. The more we put Russia's assets towards Ukraine's reconstruction  the less funding is needed from the EU.”Sixteen months on from Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion  Ukraine is facing a reconstruction bill running into more than $400 billion. While the EU has been at the forefront of pledging support  and the Commission this week requested a top-up of its long-term budget to provide Ukraine with €50 billion in grants and loans through 2027  it’s a tough balancing act as Europeans face a soaring cost of living.That's why Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told a Ukraine reconstruction conference in London on Wednesday the proceeds from the over €200 billion belonging to the Central Bank of Russia frozen in the EU will “eventually” be used to pay for Ukraine reconstruction. She said a proposal would be made before the summer break.The idea of using Russian assets had been floated over a year ago but at the time it looked like a legal impossibility. As the conflict has stretched past its one year anniversary however  signs of momentum emerged.Financial plumbingWithin days of the invasion in February 2022  the EU  U.S.  U.K.  Japan  Canada and others froze around $300 billion in Central Bank of Russia foreign reserves.Over €200 billion of that sits in Europe  mainly in central securities depositories — settlement houses that are part of the plumbing of the financial system — with Belgium’s Euroclear and Luxembourg’s Clearstream holding the largest portions.These assets generate cash which the CSDs reinvest. While the assets themselves are protected by state immunity under international law  the EU has been looking into how to use the profits.Other jurisdictions are moving in a similar direction. On Monday  the U.K. announced it would make sanctions permanent until Russia pays war compensation to Ukraine. In the U.S.  despite skepticism from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen  representatives in the House sponsored a bipartisan bill to transfer Russian assets to Ukraine. Canada and Estonia also made legal moves to confiscate assets belonging to persons listed under the sanctions regime.Uncertainties and reservationsThere are two options on the table for the EU  both of which would generate returns of around 3 percent per year  according to an EU Council assessment obtained by POLITICO.One option suggested by the Commission would be to require holders of the assets  the majority of which have been turned into cash or will do so within two to three years  to invest them  with the EU using the dividends. To go down this route would require “important legal considerations … in light of the principle of state immunity ” according to a document circulated by the EU Council.The issue is that the EU would be liable to repay Russia in case of losses linked to investment of its state assets. The likelihood of that is low but “remains a concern.”A second option is to tax windfall profits that the current asset holders are making — largely CSDs  and to a lesser extent  commercial and central banks.The EU maintains that whereas Russia retains a claim to contractually agreed amounts  extra profits belong to the CSDs and banks  and so could be taxed. The advantage of this option is the EU wouldn’t be liable for losses and as such “carry a lower risk of negative market perceptions.”The European Central Bank has warned that both options “might raise risks of undermining the legal and economic foundations on which the international role of the euro depends.” The fear is that it could discourage other countries to keep their foreign reserves in euros  as well as put European financial intermediaries at a disadvantage if the EU were to go it alone.That is why “coordinated decisions with international partners  especially at the G7  would be called for in order to mitigate the risks ” the Council wrote.The windfall profit tax seems to have gathered more support with ""a sufficient degree of willingness to work on that option ” Anders Ahnlid  a Swedish diplomat who chairs EU countries’ talks on the issue  told POLITICO. There was no consensus  he said.Rich bountyUkraine’s most vocal supporters within the bloc are adamant that Russia should pay for damages  and see its foreign reserves as a rich bounty. Poland  the Baltic countries and Slovakia have long advocated for this solution. Nordic countries are also in favor.“A way must be found to mobilize these assets to offset the cost of reconstruction ” Latvian Prime Minister Krišjānis Kariņš said at Wednesday's London conference.In a sign that the issue is gaining credence  it was discussed by EU ambassadors in Brussels on Wednesday.Envoys from France  Germany  Italy  Luxembourg  Portugal and others expressed doubts and called for further work  two EU diplomats said  having been granted anonymity to speak about confidential talks.The issue is likely to come before EU leaders at their gather in Brussels next week.According to draft summit conclusions  they are set to say they “took stock of the work done regarding Russia’s immobilized assets  and invites the Council to take work forward.”French Foreign minister Catherine Colonna said that tapping Russian assets ""poses legal questions that need to be resolved.” But she added: “However  there is a logic that those responsible for the damage are also responsible for paying for the reconstruction in some way. We continue to look for what we should do.""Suzanne Lynch contributed reporting",neutral,0.02,0.95,0.03,mixed,0.07,0.1,0.82,True,English,"['Ballsy EU Commission', 'Russia', 'Ukraine', 'EU Commission Executive Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis', 'Commission President Ursula von der Leyen', 'Russian President Vladimir Putin', 'Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen', 'two to three years', 'The European Central Bank', 'The European Commission', 'The EU executive', 'tough balancing act', 'negative market perceptions', 'European financial intermediaries', 'central securities depositories', 'unprecedented legal feat', 'important legal considerations', 'current asset holders', ""EU taxpayers' money"", 'one year anniversary', 'EU Council assessment', 'Russian state assets', 'Ukraine reconstruction conference', 'Russia foreign reserves', 'two options', 'one hand', 'financial system', 'Russian assets', 'state property', 'state immunity', 'political, legal', 'legal impossibility', 'legal moves', 'central banks', 'delicate politics', 'international protection', 'international laws', 'other hand', 'less funding', 'long-term budget', 'soaring cost', 'summer break', 'U.S.', 'U.K.', 'settlement houses', 'largest portions', 'Other jurisdictions', 'similar direction', 'war compensation', 'bipartisan bill', 'One option', 'lesser extent', 'lower risk', 'economic foundations', 'other countries', 'coordinated decisions', 'international partners', 'Financial plumbing', 'reconstruction bill', 'Western sanctions', 'sanctions regime', 'second option', 'windfall profits', 'extra profits', 'daring move', 'war damages', 'international role', 'war-torn Ukraine', 'economic risks', 'LONDON', 'plan', 'sign', 'shift', 'something', 'allies', 'storm', 'governments', 'intention', 'weight', 'Wednesday', 'next', 'months', 'consequences', 'currencies', 'court', 'idea', 'aggressor', 'question', 'POLITICO', 'invasion', 'forefront', 'support', 'top-up', 'grants', 'loans', 'Europeans', 'living', 'proceeds', 'proposal', 'time', 'conflict', 'momentum', 'days', 'February', 'Japan', 'Canada', 'others', 'Belgium', 'Euroclear', 'Luxembourg', 'Clearstream', 'cash', 'CSDs', 'Monday', 'skepticism', 'representatives', 'Estonia', 'persons', 'Uncertainties', 'reservations', 'table', 'returns', '3 percent', 'majority', 'dividends', 'route', 'light', 'principle', 'document', 'issue', 'case', 'losses', 'investment', 'likelihood', 'concern', 'commercial', 'claim', 'amounts', 'advantage', 'fear', 'euros', 'order']",2023-06-21,2023-06-22,politico.eu

26485,Clearstream,NewsApi.org,https://www.politico.eu/article/brussels-to-go-after-russian-frozen-foreign-reserves/,Ballsy EU Commission moves to make Russia pay for Ukraine,The unprecedented move is controversial among some EU countries and the ECB  which think going it alone is too risky.,"LONDON — The European Commission has a plan to help pay for the reconstruction of war-torn Ukraine using Russian state assets. It's a daring move and a sign of a shift toward something that once looked impossible.It would be an unprecedented legal feat  one strongly advocated by Ukraine and its allies but which is already kicking up a storm among governments. The EU executive’s intention to throw its weight behind such a move — confirmed by Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Wednesday — will require some delicate politics over the next few months.The plan is fraught with political  legal and economic risks. It has consequences for the role of foreign reserves in stabilizing currencies  as well as for the international protection of state property — and potentially could be endlessly litigated in court. The idea of making the aggressor pay for war damages isn’t new  but to go after foreign reserves frozen under Western sanctions would be.“On one hand  it's a question of international laws that Russia  as an aggressor  is responsible to pay for damages it's creating ” EU Commission Executive Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis told POLITICO. “On the other hand  it's also a question of EU taxpayers' money. The more we put Russia's assets towards Ukraine's reconstruction  the less funding is needed from the EU.”Sixteen months on from Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion  Ukraine is facing a reconstruction bill running into more than $400 billion. While the EU has been at the forefront of pledging support  and the Commission this week requested a top-up of its long-term budget to provide Ukraine with €50 billion in grants and loans through 2027  it’s a tough balancing act as Europeans face a soaring cost of living.That's why Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told a Ukraine reconstruction conference in London on Wednesday the proceeds from the over €200 billion belonging to the Central Bank of Russia frozen in the EU will “eventually” be used to pay for Ukraine reconstruction. She said a proposal would be made before the summer break.The idea of using Russian assets had been floated over a year ago but at the time it looked like a legal impossibility. As the conflict has stretched past its one year anniversary however  signs of momentum emerged.Financial plumbingWithin days of the invasion in February 2022  the EU  U.S.  U.K.  Japan  Canada and others froze around $300 billion in Central Bank of Russia foreign reserves.Over €200 billion of that sits in Europe  mainly in central securities depositories — settlement houses that are part of the plumbing of the financial system — with Belgium’s Euroclear and Luxembourg’s Clearstream holding the largest portions.These assets generate cash which the CSDs reinvest. While the assets themselves are protected by state immunity under international law  the EU has been looking into how to use the profits.Other jurisdictions are moving in a similar direction. On Monday  the U.K. announced it would make sanctions permanent until Russia pays war compensation to Ukraine. In the U.S.  despite skepticism from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen  representatives in the House sponsored a bipartisan bill to transfer Russian assets to Ukraine. Canada and Estonia also made legal moves to confiscate assets belonging to persons listed under the sanctions regime.Uncertainties and reservationsThere are two options on the table for the EU  both of which would generate returns of around 3 percent per year  according to an EU Council assessment obtained by POLITICO.One option suggested by the Commission would be to require holders of the assets  the majority of which have been turned into cash or will do so within two to three years  to invest them  with the EU using the dividends. To go down this route would require “important legal considerations … in light of the principle of state immunity ” according to a document circulated by the EU Council.The issue is that the EU would be liable to repay Russia in case of losses linked to investment of its state assets. The likelihood of that is low but “remains a concern.”A second option is to tax windfall profits that the current asset holders are making — largely CSDs  and to a lesser extent  commercial and central banks.The EU maintains that whereas Russia retains a claim to contractually agreed amounts  extra profits belong to the CSDs and banks  and so could be taxed. The advantage of this option is the EU wouldn’t be liable for losses and as such “carry a lower risk of negative market perceptions.”The European Central Bank has warned that both options “might raise risks of undermining the legal and economic foundations on which the international role of the euro depends.” The fear is that it could discourage other countries to keep their foreign reserves in euros  as well as put European financial intermediaries at a disadvantage if the EU were to go it alone.That is why “coordinated decisions with international partners  especially at the G7  would be called for in order to mitigate the risks ” the Council wrote.The windfall profit tax seems to have gathered more support with ""a sufficient degree of willingness to work on that option ” Anders Ahnlid  a Swedish diplomat who chairs EU countries’ talks on the issue  told POLITICO. There was no consensus  he said.Rich bountyUkraine’s most vocal supporters within the bloc are adamant that Russia should pay for damages  and see its foreign reserves as a rich bounty. Poland  the Baltic countries and Slovakia have long advocated for this solution. Nordic countries are also in favor.“A way must be found to mobilize these assets to offset the cost of reconstruction ” Latvian Prime Minister Krišjānis Kariņš said at Wednesday's London conference.In a sign that the issue is gaining credence  it was discussed by EU ambassadors in Brussels on Wednesday.Envoys from France  Germany  Italy  Luxembourg  Portugal and others expressed doubts and called for further work  two EU diplomats said  having been granted anonymity to speak about confidential talks.The issue is likely to come before EU leaders at their gather in Brussels next week.According to draft summit conclusions  they are set to say they “took stock of the work done regarding Russia’s immobilized assets  and invites the Council to take work forward.”French Foreign minister Catherine Colonna said that tapping Russian assets ""poses legal questions that need to be resolved.” But she added: “However  there is a logic that those responsible for the damage are also responsible for paying for the reconstruction in some way. We continue to look for what we should do.""Suzanne Lynch contributed reporting",neutral,0.02,0.95,0.03,mixed,0.07,0.1,0.82,True,English,"['Ballsy EU Commission', 'Russia', 'Ukraine', 'EU Commission Executive Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis', 'Commission President Ursula von der Leyen', 'Russian President Vladimir Putin', 'Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen', 'two to three years', 'The European Central Bank', 'The European Commission', 'The EU executive', 'tough balancing act', 'negative market perceptions', 'European financial intermediaries', 'central securities depositories', 'unprecedented legal feat', 'important legal considerations', 'current asset holders', ""EU taxpayers' money"", 'one year anniversary', 'EU Council assessment', 'Russian state assets', 'Ukraine reconstruction conference', 'Russia foreign reserves', 'two options', 'one hand', 'financial system', 'Russian assets', 'state property', 'state immunity', 'political, legal', 'legal impossibility', 'legal moves', 'central banks', 'delicate politics', 'international protection', 'international laws', 'other hand', 'less funding', 'long-term budget', 'soaring cost', 'summer break', 'U.S.', 'U.K.', 'settlement houses', 'largest portions', 'Other jurisdictions', 'similar direction', 'war compensation', 'bipartisan bill', 'One option', 'lesser extent', 'lower risk', 'economic foundations', 'other countries', 'coordinated decisions', 'international partners', 'Financial plumbing', 'reconstruction bill', 'Western sanctions', 'sanctions regime', 'second option', 'windfall profits', 'extra profits', 'daring move', 'war damages', 'international role', 'war-torn Ukraine', 'economic risks', 'LONDON', 'plan', 'sign', 'shift', 'something', 'allies', 'storm', 'governments', 'intention', 'weight', 'Wednesday', 'next', 'months', 'consequences', 'currencies', 'court', 'idea', 'aggressor', 'question', 'POLITICO', 'invasion', 'forefront', 'support', 'top-up', 'grants', 'loans', 'Europeans', 'living', 'proceeds', 'proposal', 'time', 'conflict', 'momentum', 'days', 'February', 'Japan', 'Canada', 'others', 'Belgium', 'Euroclear', 'Luxembourg', 'Clearstream', 'cash', 'CSDs', 'Monday', 'skepticism', 'representatives', 'Estonia', 'persons', 'Uncertainties', 'reservations', 'table', 'returns', '3 percent', 'majority', 'dividends', 'route', 'light', 'principle', 'document', 'issue', 'case', 'losses', 'investment', 'likelihood', 'concern', 'commercial', 'claim', 'amounts', 'advantage', 'fear', 'euros', 'order']",2023-06-21,2023-06-22,politico.eu

(CSE: MAXX; OTC: MAXXF; FRANKFURT: 89N) (“MAX Power” or the “Company”) is pleased to report the commencement of a high resolution heliborne magnetic and radiometric survey over the Corvette Lake North and Corvette Lake South properties to help identify prospective lithium hosting pegmatite targets.Prospectair Geosurveys of Gatineau  Quebec  is carrying out the airborne surveys. Prospectair's operations are not currently impacted by forest fire access restrictions that are currently in the area.The heliborne magnetic and radiometric survey will acquire detailed information over the properties  using 50-metre line spacing covering a total of 2 257-line kilometres. The tight line spacing is an important factor in interpreting structures and rock formations  especially where rocks are not outcropping.The data will be analyzed and interpreted by GroundTruth Exploration’s geophysics experts. Areas with prospective targets will have 3D inversion modelled to better define the local structure.MAX Power has also entered into a contract with Axiom Exploration Group Ltd. for its 2023 field summer exploration program that will consist of prospecting for LCT-type (Lithium-Cesium-Tantalum) mineralized pegmatites and soil sampling over identified magnetic and radiometric targets/anomalies with limited outcrop exposure. The Company will update investors when the summer field exploration has officially commenced.GeologyThe Corvette North Property is situated in an intriguing structural setting between two major intrusive complexes highlighted by the Langelier and Moyen plutons  as described in Quebec report RG 2020-01 (Géologie de la region du lac de la Corvette  Eeyou Istchee Baie-James). One part of the Corvette North claims is found in structural Domain IV (as described in the report) while some of the remaining claims are situated in Domain III  the same structural domain that hosts the area’s CV5 and CV8 pegmatite discoveries.The immediate region between the Langelier and Moyen plutons could produce interesting exploration potential due to the focusing of stresses and possible pegmatite intrusion emplacements. Virginia Mines worked in the Corvette North claims area for several years and conducted gold exploration campaigns discovering numerous gold occurrences in the Corvette Greenstone Belt situated in Domain V. Domain V is where the majority of the historic Virginia Mines’ Corvette and Eade gold showings occur. There are lithium pegmatite occurrences in this area that will be investigated during MAX Power’s upcoming field program.Location MapManagement cautions that mineralization hosted on adjacent and/or nearby properties is not necessarily indicative of the presence of similar mineralization or geology on the Company's properties.Frankfurt Stock Exchange (FSE) Listing in GermanyThe Company’s shares are now trading on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (""FSE"") under the symbol ""89N"".The Frankfurt Stock Exchange (FSE) is one of the world's largest international trading centers for securities.

Launching its “Invest in Ukraine  Now!” campaign  the company invites all international and national stakeholders to consider investments in Ukraine today  in order to accelerate the country’s reconstruction.“The past 16 months have shown the world that communications are indeed the lifeline of Ukraine. With the dedication of our 4000-strong team  and the support of our parent company VEON  Kyivstar has been central to Ukraine’s resilience and recovery since the very morning of February 24th  2022 ” said Oleksandr Komarov  CEO of Kyivstar. “Today’s sizeable investment commitment signifies not only a continuation of our track record  but also an acceleration of our investments. At a time when many others are refraining from making future plans  we proudly commit to ‘building back better’ in partnership with public sector counterparts and other national and international stakeholders. We would like to invite other companies to invest with the same enthusiasm to contribute today to the future Ukraine .”As the country’s largest telecommunication company  Kyivstar has been at the forefront of Ukraine’s resilience  maintaining essential connectivity for its customers – currently 24.3 million mobile and 1.1 million fixed-line users. In partnership with fellow operators  it enabled Ukranians to remain connected to their home country with roam-like-home offers  currently serving 2.5 million mobile customers in roaming. Equally importantly  Kyivstar services also benefited the wider Ukrainian population through measures including infrastructure sharing with other operators  and providing free wifi to shelters and new settlements.To enable the continuity of services  Kyivstar technical teams have skillfully performed nearly 150 thousand repairs with twice the intensity compared to the pre-conflict period  reconnected 800 settlements  upgraded and deployed nearly 10 000 4G base stations  and installed 32 000 new batteries to ensure continuity of communication during energy black-outs. With these efforts  93% of Kyivstar’s network is operational  enabling critical communications services that continue to sustain Ukraine’s society and economy.The company’s work also includes supporting the cybersecurity of Ukraine  defending the cyber space against DDoS  phishing and malware attacks which intensified by 200%  300% and 400% respectively in 2022 as compared to 2021.The USD 600 million commitment signifies an acceleration of Kyivstar’s investments in these areas in the coming three years  and will enable the continuation and expansion of these services. The new investments in network expansion – starting with ‘LTE everywhere’ and fiberization  and eventually leading to 5G-focused reconstruction - will mean higher quality internet coverage for millions of users. With the planned expansion of 4G networks  Kyivstar plans to cover 98% of Ukraine’s population in 4G in three years time  including in small and remote settlements.The investments will accelerate the digitalization of the country with essential digital services as well as connectivity. Kyivstar currently serves Ukraine with a significant portfolio of digital solutions supporting the provision of essential services such as information dissemination mobile education  and mobile health. The company recently invested in in Ukraine’s leading digital healthcare provider  Helsi  which serves a registered base of 25 million customers  not only users of Kyivstar but of all operators. The USD 600 million investment will partially be used to support further development of these services  as well as new investments into digital verticals that will make a positive social impact on the Ukrainian society.Another pillar of Kvivstar’s support to Ukraine has been charitable support  which leverages the capabilities inherent to its business as a digital operator and a focus on giving back to the society. Since the onset of the conflict  Kyivstar supported Ukrainians with humanitarian donations amounting to UAH 1.1 billion – roughly USD 32.5 million . Within the scope of its investment pledge  Kyivstar will continue to work with leading Ukrainian NGOs and social initiatives  supporting charity projects with donations and with socially responsible business partnerships.About Kyivstar:Kyivstar is the largest telecoms operator in Ukraine with 24.3 million mobile subscribers and over 1.1 million home internet subscribers.

26499,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.hospitalitynet.org/news/4116986.html,“Tailor-made touch” more important than digital efficiency for leisure travel advisors,Highly-personalised service is becoming the key differentiator for travel advisors  according to a new report from Accor  the world’s leading hospitality group.,Highly-personalised service is becoming the key differentiator for travel advisors  according to a new report from Accor  the world's leading hospitality group.The report  titled ‘Tailor-Made Touch or Digital Efficiency?’  looks at the strategies  technologies  and trends impacting leisure travel advisors in the recovery and beyond. It says that while continually digitally transforming their operations is of course vital  even more important is to develop the services and nurture the partnerships that can help them delight and connect with their customers on a level that is beyond what alternative intermediary models can achieve.The report  focused on the European market  outlines how the pandemic accelerated the transformation of the leisure travel intermediary market  with the widespread adoption of digital technology and many key players shifting their models in a bid to become platform businesses or b2b technology providers.It supports the notion that used properly  technology from messaging platforms to payments and artificial intelligence can be travel advisors’ best friend  helping them to optimise their capacity with a wide variety of inventory; access powerful digital distribution channels; better understand their customers  market themselves and provide more sophisticated and efficient services.However  it argues that even more key to travel planners’ success as they evolve is the ability to get close to their customers  to provide the high-touch personalised service now expected by travellers.Consumers increasingly value the ability of travel advisors to remove the stress from their trip  tailor it to their preferences  plan every last detail in a flexible way  and be the reassuring presence that takes care of problems when they arise. The ability to provide this bespoke level of service is a competitive advantage over the purely digital platform competitors  and one that should be maximised. It allows travel advisors to exceed expectations  delight customers and build an emotional connection that others cannot. Of course  digital technology has an important role to play in this experience  but the tech must support the ability to provide the human touch if travel advisors are to truly differentiate themselves. This is the cornerstone of how Accor builds technological transformation – it is tech with heart  technology that empowers teams and augments the guest experience. Saskia Gentil  SVP Sales  Europe & North Africa  AccorThe report contends that to provide this kind of high-level service  it is vital that travel planners understand the ever-evolving desires of leisure travellers. From the hot destinations of the moment to long-term burgeoning trends like slow travel  wellness and the hunger for sustainable trips  advisors must not only be aware of these factors but must have the inventory  partners  and local know-how to provide their clients with relevant options and insights.This insight and expertise can come partially from digital means  but by no means entirely. On-the-ground partners that can share their local knowledge and expertise and the language capabilities that are essential in a continent as culturally and linguistically diverse as Europe  of paramount importance  alongside the scale and variety of inventory to give advisors options as trends continue to evolve.The report  which also covers future factors such as AI  cryptocurrency and the metaverse as well as some of the top destinations of 2023 and beyond  can be downloaded from here. It is the first of a series of three reports scheduled to be released by Accor over the coming months  with the second and third set to look at business travel and MICE  respectively.About Accor  a world-leading hospitality groupAccor is a world leading hospitality group offering experiences across more than 110 countries in 5 400 properties  10 000 food & beverage venues  wellness facilities or flexible workspaces.

This patent will protect the innovation that NFL-101 is based on through to 2036 in 17 European countries. Alongside this  the European Medicines Agency (EMA)  following the request for scientific advice submitted by NFL Biosciences  approved the clinical development plan for NFL-101.Approval for its patent to be granted on NFL-101 in EuropeNFL Biosciences has adopted a knowledge management and protection strategy that led it to submit three patent families granting it exclusive rights to its drug candidate NFL-101. From the second patent family  this product patent  initially registered and approved in France  China  South Korea and the United States  concerns an “aqueous extract of tobacco leaves and its use for the treatment of dependence”. The innovation that NFL-101 is based on is therefore protected through to 2036 in 17 European countries (Austria  Belgium  Bulgaria  Denmark  Estonia  Finland  France  Germany  Italy  Latvia  Lithuania  Luxembourg  Malta  Netherlands  Portugal  Slovenia and Sweden). National registration applications based on this second patent family are also in the review phase in the following regions and countries: Japan  Canada  Australia  Brazil  India  Indonesia  Israel  Mexico  Philippines  Eurasia  Saudi Arabia  United Arab Emirates and Nigeria.EMA approval of the clinical development plan for NFL-101In February 2023  NFL Biosciences submitted a request for scientific advice to the EMA with a view to approving the clinical development plan for NFL-101 through to its marketing authorization. This scientific advice was issued on June 20  2023  approving NFL Biosciences’ proposed clinical development plan for NFL-101. This plan includes provisions for the CESTO II study that is underway  depending on its results  to be recognized as a first phase 3 trial for a registration application. If this is approved  there would be just one phase 3 study still to be carried out before obtaining a marketing authorization.NFL Biosciences is currently conducting two clinical trials. PRECESTO is studying the effect of NFL-101 on the desire to stop or reduce cigarette consumption and the sensations triggered by cigarettes with 34 smokers who do not want to stop smoking. The objective is to validate the complementarity of NFL-101 with nicotine substitute treatments with a view to potentially being used in combination. CESTO II is studying the efficacy of NFL-101 as a cessation aid with 318 smokers who want to stop smoking. The objective is to provide a demonstration of efficacy to be part of a marketing authorization application. In accordance with the business plan  the PRECESTO trial results are expected to be available in the third quarter of 2023  followed by the first results of the CESTO II trial in the fourth quarter of 2023.About NFL BiosciencesNFL Biosciences is a biopharmaceutical company based in the Montpellier area which develops botanical drug candidates for the treatment of addictions.

This patent will protect the innovation that NFL-101 is based on through to 2036 in 17 European countries. Alongside this  the European Medicines Agency (EMA)  following the request for scientific advice submitted by NFL Biosciences  approved the clinical development plan for NFL-101.Approval for its patent to be granted on NFL-101 in EuropeNFL Biosciences has adopted a knowledge management and protection strategy that led it to submit three patent families granting it exclusive rights to its drug candidate NFL-101. From the second patent family  this product patent  initially registered and approved in France  China  South Korea and the United States  concerns an “aqueous extract of tobacco leaves and its use for the treatment of dependence”. The innovation that NFL-101 is based on is therefore protected through to 2036 in 17 European countries (Austria  Belgium  Bulgaria  Denmark  Estonia  Finland  France  Germany  Italy  Latvia  Lithuania  Luxembourg  Malta  Netherlands  Portugal  Slovenia and Sweden). National registration applications based on this second patent family are also in the review phase in the following regions and countries: Japan  Canada  Australia  Brazil  India  Indonesia  Israel  Mexico  Philippines  Eurasia  Saudi Arabia  United Arab Emirates and Nigeria.EMA approval of the clinical development plan for NFL-101In February 2023  NFL Biosciences submitted a request for scientific advice to the EMA with a view to approving the clinical development plan for NFL-101 through to its marketing authorization. This scientific advice was issued on June 20  2023  approving NFL Biosciences’ proposed clinical development plan for NFL-101. This plan includes provisions for the CESTO II study that is underway  depending on its results  to be recognized as a first phase 3 trial for a registration application. If this is approved  there would be just one phase 3 study still to be carried out before obtaining a marketing authorization.NFL Biosciences is currently conducting two clinical trials. PRECESTO is studying the effect of NFL-101 on the desire to stop or reduce cigarette consumption and the sensations triggered by cigarettes with 34 smokers who do not want to stop smoking. The objective is to validate the complementarity of NFL-101 with nicotine substitute treatments with a view to potentially being used in combination. CESTO II is studying the efficacy of NFL-101 as a cessation aid with 318 smokers who want to stop smoking. The objective is to provide a demonstration of efficacy to be part of a marketing authorization application. In accordance with the business plan  the PRECESTO trial results are expected to be available in the third quarter of 2023  followed by the first results of the CESTO II trial in the fourth quarter of 2023.About NFL BiosciencesNFL Biosciences is a biopharmaceutical company based in the Montpellier area which develops botanical drug candidates for the treatment of addictions.

(NASDAQ: VEON  Euronext Amsterdam: VEON)  a global digital operator that provides converged connectivity and online services  today announced that it will invest  through its subsidiary Kyivstar  equivalent of USD 600 million in the recovery of Ukraine over the next three years. The investment will span Kyivstar's infrastructure projects  ensuring essential connectivity and 4G services throughout the country  the development of superior digital services accessible to all Ukrainians  and community support projects.The investment pledge is announced as a part of the international Ukraine Recovery Conference in London on June 21st and 22nd with a focus on mobilising international support for Ukraine's recovery and reconstruction. Launching its ""Invest in Ukraine  Now!"" campaign  the company invites all international and national stakeholders to consider investments in Ukraine today  in order to accelerate the country's reconstruction.""The past 16 months have shown the world that communications are indeed the lifeline of Ukraine. With the dedication of our 4000-strong team  and the support of our parent company VEON  Kyivstar has been central to Ukraine's resilience and recovery since the very morning of February 24th  2022 "" said Oleksandr Komarov  CEO of Kyivstar.""Today's sizeable investment commitment signifies not only a continuation of our track record  but also an acceleration of our investments. At a time when many others are refraining from making future plans  we proudly commit to 'building back better' in partnership with public sector counterparts and other national and international stakeholders. We would like to invite other companies to invest with the same enthusiasm to contribute today to the future Ukraine.""As the country's largest telecommunication company  Kyivstar has been at the forefront of Ukraine's resilience  maintaining essential connectivity for its customers - currently 24.3 million mobile and 1.1 million fixed-line users. In partnership with fellow operators  it enabled Ukrainians to remain connected to their home country with roam-like-home offers  currently serving 2.5 million mobile customers in roaming. Equally importantly  Kyivstar services also benefited the wider Ukrainian population through measures including infrastructure sharing with other operators  and providing free Wi-Fi to shelters and new settlements.To enable the continuity of services  Kyivstar technical teams have skilfully performed nearly 150 thousand repairs with twice the intensity compared to the pre-conflict period  reconnected 800 settlements  upgraded and deployed nearly 10 000 4G base stations  and installed 32 000 new batteries to ensure continuity of communication during energy black-outs. With these efforts  93% of Kyivstar's network is operational  enabling critical communications services that continue to sustain Ukraine's society and economy.The company's work also includes supporting the cybersecurity of Ukraine  defending the cyber space against DDoS  phishing and malware attacks which intensified by 200%  300% and 400% respectively in 2022 as compared to 2021.The USD 600 million commitment signifies an acceleration of Kyivstar's investments in these areas in the coming three years  and will enable the continuation and expansion of these services. The new investments in network expansion - starting with 'LTE everywhere' and fiberization  and eventually leading to 5G-focused reconstruction - will mean higher quality internet coverage for millions of users. With the planned expansion of 4G networks  Kyivstar plans to cover 98% of Ukraine's population in 4G in three years' time  including in small and remote settlements.The investments will accelerate the digitalization of the country with essential digital services as well as connectivity. Kyivstar currently serves Ukraine with a significant portfolio of digital solutions supporting the provision of essential services such as information dissemination  mobile education  and mobile health. The company recently invested in in Ukraine's leading digital healthcare provider  Helsi  which serves a registered base of 25 million customers  not only users of Kyivstar but of all operators.

The primary objective of these collaborations is to accelerate the development of HDF's hydrogen power plants  aiming to enhance stable power supply in off-grid areas in the Philippines. The first MoU was established with the Mindanao Development Authority (MinDA) and the Philippine Department of Energy  while the second was signed with the national utility  the National Power Corporation (NPC). Both signing ceremonies were witnessed by the French Minister Delegate of Foreign Trade  Mr. Olivier Becht  and the Philippine Department of Trade and Industry's Secretary  Mr. Alfredo Pascual.As an island nation highly susceptible to the impacts of climate change  the Philippines faces challenges in providing stable electricity supply  with many regions relying on isolated grids powered by diesel fuel. These collaborations with HDF Energy aim to expedite the development of Renewstable® multi-megawatt hydrogen power plants  which will provide stable  continuous  and clean power to off-grid areas  operating around the clock. Renewstable® presents a green alternative to conventional diesel fuel power plants by utilizing solely solar or wind energy and water to generate electricity  thus mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and noise pollution. Its distinctive feature lies in its ability to provide baseload power by combining an intermittent renewable energy source with substantial on-site energy storage in the form of green hydrogen.The first MoU was signed with the Mindanao Development Authority (MinDA) and the Philippine Department of Energy  with the objective of promoting and facilitating investments in hydrogen projects within the Mindanao region. This collaborative effort aims to develop ten Renewstable® hydrogen power plants. The second agreement was signed with the National Power Corporation (NPC) of the Philippines to foster joint studies  research and development  information exchange  and technical assistance to facilitate the establishment of Renewstable® projects in isolated areas in the Philippines.These signing ceremonies served as key highlights of the 10th Philippines – France Joint Economic Committee (JEC) meeting  which seeks to strengthen economic cooperation between France and the Philippines in various sectors  including energy  agriculture  science and technology  and security.Mathieu Geze  HDF's Director for Asia and President Director of HDF Energy Philippines  declared: ""We are thrilled to forge strong partnerships with NPC  MinDa  and the Philippine Department of Energy  uniting our efforts to propel the advancement of hydrogen power plant projects in the Philippines and empower the nation's pursuit of energy independence. At HDF Energy  we envision ourselves not only as a developer  financier  builder  and operator of hydrogen power plants  but as an active participant in the progress and prosperity of the communities where our projects will thrive.""Dr. Fernando Martin Roxas  NPC President & Chief Executive Officer  noted:“NPC is a government owned and controlled corporation mandated to ensure the total electrification of missionary areas through innovative power technologies and private sector participation. This MoU will further improve the technical capability and increase the resources of NPC in providing power or electrification services to the communities within its jurisdiction. With the support of HDF Energy and the French government  we hope that we can pilot the construction of a hydrogen power plant to be replicated to other various SPUG (Small Power Utilities Group) areas in the Philippines.“Secretary Maria Belen S. Acosta  MinDA Chairperson  declared: “We are grateful for the French government's support of this partnership through HDF Energy's intent to invest  build  and operate low-carbon technology projects. This pioneering renewable energy generation plant in the country  once fully implemented  will be able to provide a sustainable  consistent  and affordable energy supply to the island. In addition  it will support the local economies  preserve natural resources  and promote the vast investment potentials of Mindanao. I am confident that through the Philippines-France JEC  we will be able to reap the gains from HDF's upcoming projects.”ABOUT HDF ENERGYHDF Energy is a global pioneer in high-power hydrogen power plants. The Company designs and develops power plants that generate non-intermittent  non-polluting renewable energy  day and night. In addition  HDF Energy organises the financing  construction and operation of these power plants through SPVs.HDF is the designer of Renewstable®  its flagship model of multi-megawatt power plants producing firm power from an intermittent renewable energy source (wind or solar) and massive energy storage in the form of green hydrogen generated on site.HDF Energy is also an industrial company which will mass produce  from 2024  the most strategic component of its power plants - high-power fuel cells - in its plant near Bordeaux.

These data will be presented during a poster session today and have been selected for an oral poster presentation on June 23rd from 12:45 to 12:55 CEST at the EASL Congress in Vienna  Austria.Professor Florence Wong  University of Toronto  Hepatologist at Toronto General Hospital  Ontario  Canada and Principal Investigator for the POSEIDON study  commented: “Recurrent or refractory ascites has a negative impact on patients’ lives requiring management with regular paracentesis. The results from the POSEIDON study have shown that the alfapump is very effective at controlling this  virtually eliminating the need for large volume paracentesis and significantly improving patients’ quality of life at six months post-implantation. While patients implanted with the alfapump need to be closely monitored for the development of acute kidney injury or infection  in the POSEIDON study these events readily resolved with the standard of care.”Ian Crosbie  Chief Executive Officer at Sequana Medical  added: “We are excited about this further POSEIDON data as we believe it continues to support alfapump as a breakthrough for recurrent or refractory liver ascites patients. Together with the positive primary endpoint data reported previously  these results further support the clinical benefits of the alfapump and show a survival rate that compares favorably to literature. With more than 75 000 people in North America suffering from recurrent or refractory liver ascites by 2025  and growing by 6-7% a year due to NASH  modern and effective solutions like alfapump are urgently needed.”Positive data from the POSEIDON studyForty patients with recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis have been implanted with the alfapump in the Pivotal Cohort of the POSEIDON study. Of these patients  48% had an underlying etiology of alcoholic liver disease and 38% suffered from non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)  clearly reflecting the growing prevalence and importance of NASH as a key driver of liver cirrhosis. Before enrolment  these patients required on average 3.2 therapeutic paracentesis (TP) per month and had an average MELDi score of 15.2  indicating the severly decompensated state of these patients.As previously reportedii  Pivotal Cohort patients met all pre-specified primary effectiveness endpoints with statistical significance at six months post-implantation  including:1) 100% median per-patient reduction in TP post- vs pre-implantiii (p<0.001)  vs hypothesis of at least a 50% reduction  and2) 77% of patients with at least 50% reduction in number of TP post- vs pre-implantiii (p<0.001)  vs hypothesis of at least 50% of patients.Primary safety endpoint dataii  including the rate of alfapump-related open-surgical re-interventions  explants or deaths adjudicated by the Clinical Events Committee (CEC)  were in line with expectations with six primary safety events. Of the six primary safety events  three were explants due to wound or skin erosion  and three were explants due to patient-reported discomfort (all patient-reported discomfort events were adjudicated by the CEC as moderate severity).Key secondary endpoints within six months  also adjudicated by the CEC  include the number of Major Adverse Events (MAE)  serious infections and acute kidney injuries (AKI). MAEs were pre-defined in the protocol together with the principal investigators and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as one of the following events: AKI > stage 2  hepatorenal syndrome  hepatic encephalopathy > grade 2  spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and reccurent or refractory infection related to paracentesis or the alfapump system  procedure or therapy. Despite disease progression  there was a similar number of MAEs post-implant vs pre-implantiii (N=5 vs N=5) as well as a comparable number of serious infections post-implant vs pre-implantiii (N=3 vs N=2) of which only one post-implant serious infection was adjudicated to be device-related.Renal function is often impaired in patients with advanced cirrhosis and patients with evidence of renal failure were excluded from the study. Therefore post-implant vs pre-implantiii AKI rates are not comparable because any patient with a non-transient AKI in the pre-implant period was not implanted with the alfapump and excluded from the Pivotal Cohort. In the six months post-implantation  most AKIs were stage 1 (N=16) which are of limited clinical relevance. AKI stage 2 (N=4) and stage 3 (N=2) post-implantation were resolved in three instances and unresolved at the time of death from unrelated cause in three other instances. Importantly  creatine and eGFRiv levels were stable over long-term follow-up indicating that these AKI events had no impact on their renal function.Patient’s quality of life was assessed via established health-survey questionnaires. Despite disease progression in these patients  both the physical component score of SF36 (a general health quality of life measure) and the Ascites Q score (a quality of life measure specific for patients with ascites) indicated clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvements six months post-implant vs pre-implantiii (N= 26  p<0.001).Although the POSEIDON study was not powered for survival outcome  a positive trend in survival was observed in patients implanted with the alfapump  with a Kaplan-Meier estimate indicating a 70% survival probability at one year post-implantation. This compares favourably with the published literature reporting a survival rate for refractory ascites patients of only 50% at 12 months.vData from the POSEIDON study will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal in 2023.Details of oral poster presentation at EASL 2023 by Prof. WongTitle: The effects of alfa pump on ascites control and quality of life in patients with cirrhosis and recurrent or refractory ascites: pivotal trial resultsThe effects of pump on ascites control and quality of life in patients with cirrhosis and recurrent or refractory ascites: pivotal trial results Presenter: Dr. Florence Wong  MD  FAASLD  University of TorontoTrack : Cirrhosis & complicationsCirrhosis & complications Timing: Wednesday  21 June 2023 and Friday  23 June 2023 between 12:45 – 12:55 CESTSequana Medical management will attend the EASL Congress and is available to meet.Details Conference Call and Webcast by Sequana MedicalSequana Medical management will host a conference call with a live webcast presentation today at 15:00 CEST / 09:00 am EST.Registration webcast: please click hereRegistration conference call (only if you wish to participate in the Q&A): please click here.

The study consisted of a Pivotal Cohort for primary endpoint analysis and an additional Roll-In Cohort for new centers to become familiarized with the implantation procedure before they enrolled patients in the Pivotal Cohort. Pivotal Cohort patients entered into a three-month pre-implant observation period in which they received standard of care therapy (consisting of therapeutic paracentesis (TP)) before the alfapump was implanted.The primary effectiveness endpoint hypotheses include i) at least 50% median per-patient reduction in TP post- vs pre-implantii and ii) at least 50% of patients achieve a 50% reduction in number of TP post- vs pre-implantii. The primary safety endpoint is the rate of alfapump-related open surgical re-interventions  explants or death through six months adjudicated by the Clinical Events Committee. Patients are followed for up to two years post-implant for analysis of secondary outcome measurements including safety (device and/or procedure-related adverse events)  quality of life (assessed by general SF36 as well as disease-specific Ascites Q questionnaires)  nutritional status  health economics and overall survival.About Sequana MedicalSequana Medical NV is a pioneer in treating fluid overload  a serious and frequent clinical complication in patients with liver disease  heart failure and cancer. These patients can have up to 15 liters of extra fluid in their bodies  causing major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility that severely impacts daily life. Although diuretics are standard of care  the problem is that in many patients they are no longer effective and / or tolerable. There are limited effective treatment options for these patients  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing “diuretic-resistant” patient population.alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  delivering major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients and reducing costs for healthcare systems. The Company has reported positive primary endpoint data from the North American pivotal POSEIDON trial of the alfapump in recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis  enabling the filing of a Pre-Market Approval (PMA) application with the FDA  planned for H2 2023. Having delivered clinical proof-of-concept for DSR as a disease-modifying drug program for the treatment of heart failure  the Company will commence MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical trial of DSR 2.0  with initial data expected in Q4 2023.Sequana Medical is listed on Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium.

(Jadeite Medicines) a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company headquartered in Tokyo  Japan (President & CEO  Eiichi Takahashi) has received Orphan Drug Designation for odevixibat for the expected indication of PFIC from the Ministry of Health  Labour and Welfare (MHLW) of Japan. Jadeite Medicines has also announced initiation of a phase 3 trial in PFIC for patients in Japan. PFIC is a rare and devastating disorder affecting young children with no approved treatment in Japan.This Phase 3 trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of an oral dosage of odevixibat in Japanese PFIC patients. Odevixibat is marketed by Ipsen Pharma (Ipsen) in the United States for the treatment of pruritus in all subtypes of PFIC and in Europe for the treatment of all subtypes of PFIC.Through the development of odevixibat  Jadeite Medicines aspires to contribute to the treatment of patients suffering from PFIC. Jadeite Medicines commits to the health and quality of life for patients through our relentless R&D in drug development in order to fulfill patient unmet needs.Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis (PFIC)PFIC is a spectrum[1-4] of autosomal recessive genetic disorders in which cholestasis may lead to end-stage liver disease.[5] The estimated global incidence of PFIC is 1 in 100 000 live births.[5] Currently in the U.S.  it is estimated that there are 500 PFIC patients who may be eligible for IBATi treatment. Subtypes PFIC1  PFIC2 and PFIC3 are the most common.[5] In addition  other rare forms of PFIC exist with varying degrees of cholestasis.[6] Patients with PFIC have impaired bile flow  or cholestasis  and the resulting bile build-up in liver cells causes liver disease and symptoms. The most debilitating symptom of PFIC is pruritus (itching)  which may be so severe that it leads to skin mutilation  loss of sleep  irritability  poor attention and impaired school performance.[4] Up to 80% of PFIC patients suffer from severe pruritus  associated with abrasions  skin mutilation  hemorrhage or scarring.[7] PFIC is designated as an intractable disease (designation number 338) by the MHLW in Japan. In Japan  an estimated 100 patients suffer from PFIC. Currently there are no treatments except for symptomatic treatments in Japan and without conservative treatment patients will require surgical options including liver transplantation.OdevixibatOdevixibat is being developed by Albireo Pharma  Inc.  which was acquired by Ipsen Pharmaceutical in March 2023. Albireo Pharma and Jadeite Medicines entered into an exclusive licensing agreement for the development and commercialization of odevixibat in Japan  in October 2021.Odevixibat is a once-daily  potent non-systemic ileal bile acid transport inhibitor (IBATi) that acts locally within the small intestine. Odevixibat is the first ever approved treatment for all subtypes of PFIC for patients above the age of three months in the U.S. (for the treatment of pruritis). Odevixibat is also approved by the EMA and the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency of the United Kingdom for all subtypes of PFIC for patients above the age of six months and is being widely commercialized in Europe. Odevixibat has been granted orphan drug designation in the U.S. and Europe. Ipsen is also filing for regulatory approval for Alagille syndrome in the U.S. based on their successful ASSERT Phase 3 clinical trial. Ipsen is also studying the use of odevixibat in other rare pediatric cholestatic liver diseases with the BOLD Phase 3 clinical trial in patients with biliary atresia where topline data from the BOLD trial is expected in 2024.Jadeite Medicines Inc.Jadeite Medicines Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company established in 2020 to fulfill the unmet medical needs of patients in Japan by introducing and developing innovative medicines from around the world.

Today  Aegon presents the next chapter of this transformation. Aegon CEO  Lard Friese  will be joined by CFO Matt Rider  Duncan Russell  Chief Transformation Officer  Will Fuller  CEO of Transamerica – Aegon's largest business unit – and other members of the management team of Transamerica to outline their plans to create value. The event  entitled ""Transforming Aegon – The Next Chapter "" follows the successful execution of the first phase of the company's transformation that was announced at Aegon's 2020 Capital Markets Day (CMD).Aegon CEO  Lard Friese  commented: ""Today  Aegon is a more focused company with improved operational performance  a stronger balance sheet  and an enhanced risk profile. We have delivered on the plans outlined at our last Capital Markets Day. The transaction to combine Aegon's Dutch pension  life and non-life insurance  banking  and mortgage origination activities with a.s.r. closes off the first chapter of Aegon's transformation and enables us to accelerate the execution of our strategy.""At today's CMD  we will outline the steps we are taking to ensure that Transamerica  our US subsidiary  captures its full potential. Transamerica has had a long and proud history of making financial services available to the many  not just the few. We aim to accelerate Transamerica's growth and build America's leading middle market life insurance and retirement company. This rapidly growing market  representing 68 million middle income households  is the largest in the US and is relatively underserved by the financial services industry. Transamerica is well positioned to grow and to capture the opportunities in this market "" said Lard Friese.Transamerica's strategy consists of four focus areas. First  Transamerica will invest further in World Financial Group (WFG)  its insurance distribution network of around 70 000 independent agents. WFG distributes Transamerica products  as well as those of other insurers. Its distinctive  nationwide network is the third largest agency force in the United States and the largest in Canada. WFG's agents come from a wide range of diverse cultural backgrounds  and meet the needs of the communities in which they operate. Transamerica's ambition is to increase the number of WFG agents to 110 000 by 2027  while at the same time improving agent productivity.Second  Transamerica will invest in its product manufacturing capabilities and operating model in order to provide an improved and differentiated customer experience and to support sales growth. It will insource and redesign critical operational and administrative functions  including core customer services  that are currently managed by an external provider. As a result  Transamerica will be well positioned to grow its life insurance business sold through both WFG and third-party distributors.Third  in Workplace Solutions  Transamerica aims to increase earnings from its retirement business which provides recordkeeping and investment services for US defined contribution plans  and advice to plan participants. With a focus on the mid-sized and pooled employer retirement plan market  Transamerica will invest to leverage its capabilities as a recordkeeper with the ambition to materially increase the penetration of the ancillary products and services it offers. In particular  it will build on its expertise in stable value investment options and individual retirement savings accounts.Fourth  Transamerica will continue to reduce its exposure to Financial Assets and improve the level and predictability of its capital generation. Since the 2020 CMD  Aegon has released USD 1.5 billion of capital from its Financial Assets in the US. Looking forward  Transamerica will expand the scope of Financial Assets to include legacy Universal Life contracts  and take additional management actions which are expected to release another USD 1.2 billion of capital in the next five years. The financial flexibility this creates will be prioritized to further reduce exposure to Financial Assets.In addition to sharing its plans for Transamerica  Aegon will provide an update on the a.s.r. transaction  which is expected to be completed in the coming weeks. Shortly after closing  Aegon expects to initiate the associated capital return of EUR 1.5 billion as announced on October 27  2022  through a share buyback over a 12-month period. Post-closing  Aegon intends to hold its 29.99% strategic stake in a.s.r. to capture the value of cost and capital synergies associated with the integration of its former Dutch business into a.s.r.Aegon is making progress on the review of the implications of the transaction with a.s.r for group supervision. The discussions with the college of supervisors  representing all local regulators of Aegon  are ongoing and no decisions have been made. Any further details will be made available if and when appropriate. Regardless of the outcome  Aegon intends to maintain its head office in the Netherlands. Its shares will remain listed on Euronext in Amsterdam and the New York Stock Exchange.Aegon will continue to strengthen its UK business and its fully-owned global asset manager  and to support their journeys to build leadership positions. In addition  Aegon will invest in growing its various joint ventures in Aegon International and Asset Management. In 2024  Aegon will provide an update on its plans to deliver on the full potential of these businesses. Aegon's near-term priority in the UK is to maintain expense discipline to create room for investments  and to drive sales growth in the Retail and Workplace channels on its platform. Aegon Asset Management is in the process of completing the implementation of its global operating platform. It will continue to focus on growing in alternative asset and retirement investment solutions  and will implement additional efficiency measures. In its joint ventures  Aegon will continue to create value by using its international expertise to leverage the knowledge of the local management teams.""As part of the next chapter in our transformation  we are adapting our organization and changing the operational set-up of the holding company. The business units will focus on delivering on their strategic objectives by improving customer experience and propositions  strengthening their operations and maintaining strong controls. The holding company will set the overarching strategic direction  identify and drive business opportunities  allocate capital in a rational and disciplined manner  manage performance tightly  set the risk appetite and actively manage risk. Lastly  we will take key talent management decisions. To mark these changes and to better reflect our company's new profile  Aegon will operate with a refreshed logo "" said Lard Friese.Financial implications and financial targetsThe execution of Transamerica's strategic plan is expected to result in a significant increase of the earnings on in-force from its Strategic Assets. Transamerica plans to reinvest part of its earnings on in-force from Strategic Assets in profitable new business to secure long-term growth. This is anticipated to result in a gradual increase in operating capital generation from Strategic Assets to fund growing remittances to the Holding. Transamerica targets a mid-single digit growth rate of its remittances in the medium-term  from a level of USD 550 million in 2023. The associated investments to achieve Transamerica's strategic ambitions are expected to have a one-time impact of -15%-points on the US RBC ratio and reduce Aegon's equity by around USD 450 million. The majority of these impacts are expected to be incurred in the second quarter of 2023.The additional actions that Transamerica has identified to reduce its exposure to Financial Assets include the intention to remove the remaining morbidity improvement assumption and increase the inflation assumption in its Long-Term Care business. Associated with these assumption changes  Transamerica will seek approvals for additional actuarially justified premium rate increases with a combined value of USD 700 million. In addition  Transamerica will take actions to mitigate the capital volatility caused by its annuity and universal life with secondary guarantees blocks of business. These management actions are expected to have a combined one-time impact of -5%-pts on the US RBC ratio and reduce Aegon's equity by around USD 250 million. The majority of these impacts are expected to be incurred in the second quarter of 2023.Throughout its transformation  Aegon will ensure that it maintains sufficient capital in its business units and at the Holding so that management can focus its time and energy on increasing the return on capital  and distributing capital to shareholders. In Aegon's capital management approach  the company will continue to focus on managing the capital positions of its business units to their respective operating levels over time. For Transamerica  the operating level remains at an RBC ratio of 400%. The RBC ratio was 436% on March 31  2023  which makes Transamerica well positioned to manage the RBC ratio to the operating level and to continue to pay its planned remittances even in the case of moderately adverse scenarios.The operating range for Cash Capital at Holding remains EUR 0.5 billion to EUR 1.5 billion. Aegon expects to reduce the Cash Capital at Holding from EUR 1.4 billion on March 31  2023  to around the mid-point of the operating range over time. Aegon intends to do so by returning capital to shareholders in the absence of value-creating opportunities  in line with its capital management approach. As previously indicated  Aegon will reduce its gross financial leverage by up to EUR 700 million following the closing of the transaction with a.s.r.  which brings it to around EUR 5.0 billion.By increasing its earnings and managing capital in a disciplined manner  Aegon expects to grow operating capital generation over the plan period and translate this into increasing free cash flow. Aegon expects its operating capital generation before holding funding and operating expenses to grow from at least EUR 1.0 billion in 2023 to around EUR 1.2 billion in 2025. Free cash flow is expected to grow in line with the anticipated growth in operating capital generation  and is anticipated to benefit from the expected growth in dividends to be received on Aegon's strategic stake in a.s.r. As a result  Aegon expects to grow its free cash flow from around EUR 600 million in 2023 to around EUR 800 million in 2025. Dividends are expected to remain well covered by free cash flow.
