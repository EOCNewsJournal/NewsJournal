AlenuraTM is a patented  innovative  clinical-stage bladder instillation product candidate that combines lidocaine  a well-established anaesthetic  in a new alkalinized form with heparin  a glycoso-amino-glycan (GAG)  a component of bladder mucous membranes.AlenuraTM has the potential of becoming a first-line drug treatment for acute pain in patients with interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome.Thanks to the novel dual mode-of-action  AlenuraTM has the unique potential to i) immediately relieve pain  and ii) augment the mucous layer of the bladder. In previous controlled clinical trials4  AlenuraTM was well-tolerated and suggested the drug product candidate was more effective in terms of pain relief  urgency response and improvement of symptoms compared to placebo  heparin alone and lidocaine alone.Stijn Van Rompay  Chief Executive Officer of Hyloris  commented: “Currently there are no drug products specifically approved to treat acute bladder pain in patients with IC/BPS. AlenuraTM holds the promise of a ready-to-use solution to be administered by physicians. We are highly motivated to offer relief to these patients by improving the symptoms disrupting their daily lives.”“This ambitious phase 2 program includes additional clinical trials  potentially reducing time and number of patients needed in Phase 3 trials  in order to help patients waiting for an efficient treatment sooner rather than later.”Alenura TM is being developed in partnership with Vaneltix Pharma  Inc (Vaneltix)  the sponsor of the clinical trial. Hyloris has committed to staged investments of in total maximum USD 6.7 Mio for multiple Phase 2 trials (4-arm  multi-dosage  PK)  manufacturing and regulatory related activities  and a loan of USD 0.5 Mio.Hyloris will be eligible to receive a tiered percentage of the product margin generated by AlenuraTM.About this Phase 2 TrialVaneltix is the sponsor of the phase 2 clinical program. The primary endpoint will be to evaluate the change in Sum of bladder Pain Intensity Differences from baseline to 12 hours (SPID-12) after administration of AlenuraTM compared with the SPID-12 after administration of its individual active components (lidocaine and heparin)  and to placebo as determined by using the 11-point NRS (numerical rating scale) for bladder pain.The trial will enrol a target of 120 patients across multiple sites in the United States. Each subject will receive a single blinded dose of AlenuraTM  placebo  lidocaine  or heparin by random assignment.About Interstitial Cystitis/Bladder Pain Syndrome (IC/BPS) and AlenuraTMIC/BPS is a condition that results in recurring discomfort or pain in the bladder and surrounding pelvic region. The scientific team of Vaneltix  led by Dr. C. Lowell Parsons  a distinguished Professor Emeritus  Urologist and Surgeon  believes that ICS/BPS stems from an anatomical defect in the protective bladder lining (the GAG mucous layer) which exposes nerve endings to toxic components in urine. Patients often experience episodes of severe intensity pain lasting hours to days (painful flares)  which requires treatment. IC/BPS is more prevalent in women  although men can experience symptoms as well  and although underdiagnosed  it is estimated at least 6 million people in the U.S. suffer from the condition.AlenuraTM is a unique  combination product of alkalinised lidocaine and the glycosaminoglycan heparin. Alkalinised lidocaine penetrates the transitional epithelial cell layer and provides immediate pain relief. Whereas heparin sodium is thought to augment the natural mucous layer of the bladder to prevent further irritation of the bladder and prolong the anaesthetic effect. AlenuraTM will be supplied as a prefilled syringe for intra-vesicular administration to the bladder through an installation procedure and is protected by multiple patents and patent applications potentially providing exclusivity up to 2038.About HylorisHyloris is a specialty biopharma company focused on innovating  reinventing  and optimizing existing medications to address important healthcare needs and deliver relevant improvements for patients  healthcare professionals and payors.

The stock fraction is based on the volume-weighted average price of EUR 32.3638 for NN Group shares on Euronext Amsterdam for the five trading days from 16 June 2023 up to and including 22 June 2023. Any remaining stock fractions will be paid in cash. The stock and cash dividend are approximately equal in value. For shareholders that have not made a choice during the election period  the dividend will be paid in cash.Shareholders representing approximately 47.71% of the outstanding number of shares have elected to receive the final dividend in ordinary shares.

The share buyback programme will be executed within the limitations of the existing authority granted by the General Meeting on 2 June 2023  and will be performed in compliance with the safe harbour provisions for share buybacks.

The newly developed offering will be led by current Chief Executive Officer of Banijay France  François de Brugada.This announcement follows FL Entertainment’s recent new ventures – an investment into The Independents  and the acquisition of Balich Wonder Studio by Banijay. These investments in the events business  combined with the creation of Banijay Events  showcase FL Entertainment’s ambition to become a global leader in the production of live events. The new offering will sit as part of FL Entertainment’s leading global content production and distribution operations  led by Banijay’s Chief Executive Officer  Marco Bassetti.This strategic initiative is based on the assessment that the live events production industry has significant growth potential. It remains largely unconsolidated and has a business model very similar to that of content production and distribution  on which media and entertainment powerhouse  Banijay  was built. Banijay reached €3.2bn in revenues for 2022  proving the strength of its long-term creative strategy and approach  on which FL Entertainment will further capitalise.Brugada has served as CEO of Banijay France since 2015  building an ecosystem of the best talents  labels and IP  firmly positioning the group as the country’s undisputed production leader. Having gathered a local holding currently comprising more than 15 production labels  Brugada was responsible for nurturing a local catalogue of almost 3 000 hours of diverse  premium content each year  a portfolio that has continued to evolve and prosper under his guidance. Having first joined Banijay at its inception in 2008 as EVP for Content  Brugada was then appointed Chief Operating Officer  partnering closely with Chairman  Stéphane Courbit  to support the organisation’s initial international expansion ambitions across France  Spain  the US  Nordics  Germany and Australia. In this position  he also initiated internal cross-territory format sharing and helped develop and position the organisation’s worldwide brand.Evolving and executing the group’s dedicated strategy  Brugada will be tasked with growing this part of the business  developing synergies with the rest of the group  and identifying additional companies to build its dedicated portfolio.François Riahi  CEO  FL Entertainment: “The live events business has rapidly soared post-Covid and given our already-established entertainment assets  it represents a perfect addition to our Group and to our strategy to become an integrated global entertainment leader. Capitalising on our entrepreneurial production/distribution model  we have great ambitions in this area and are confident this new reinforced offering will become a destination for creativity and awe-inspiring activity.”Marco Bassetti  CEO  Banijay: “Diversifying our content capabilities beyond the screen marks a real gear shift for the group. Banijay Events launches with a solid base thanks to the recently announced investments  and from here  there are so many opportunities for further collaboration and onward global growth. This  combined with the appointment of François  who has been a key player in Banijay’s journey  marks a significant commitment to the live events business and we all look forward to seeing what comes next.”François de Brugada  CEO  Banijay France: “It has been an exciting journey growing the business in France  and as part of that work  bolstering the scripted offering. Joining FLE to lead Banijay Events  is for me like going back to the early years of Banijay; but this time with two major players already onboard – I am thrilled by this new challenge! There are many similarities between Banijay and the events production business  and I have no doubt  that in blending the two experiences  we can establish a healthy footing in the market  as was done in the audio-visual space.”Recruitment is currently underway to find a replacement CEO for Banijay France  with Brugada remaining in place until at least September  to ensure a smooth and effective transition period.-Ends-For further enquiries please contact:FL Entertainment:Caroline CohenHead of Investor Relations at FL Entertainment+33682759639c.cohen@flentertainment.comHugues Boëton – Brunswick Group+33679992715hboeton@brunswickgroup.comNicolas Grange – Brunswick Group+33629562019ngrange@brunswickgroup.comAbout FL EntertainmentFounded by Stéphane Courbit  a 30-year entertainment industry pioneer and entrepreneur  FL Entertainment Group is a global leader in multimedia content and online sports betting and gaming  combining the strengths of Banijay  the world’s largest independent producer distributor  with Betclic Everest Group  the fastest growing online sports betting platform in Europe.

The energy company will invest €3 million through its start-up programme  PERSEO  which will allow it to control 12.8% of the capital and have a presence on Kyoto's board of directors.With this step  Iberdrola advances in its strategy of providing industrial customers with solutions to decarbonise their heat demand  which represents more than 50% of industry's final energy needs. Thermal storage solutions are a key technology for supplying green heat at a competitive cost. Green industrial heat generated with this technology  together with green hydrogen  ammonia and other derivatives in which Iberdrola is a world leader  complements the portfolio of sustainable energy solutions that Iberdrola offers its industrial customers.""The partnership with Kyoto and its Heatcube thermal storage solution is a further step for Iberdrola in its mission to decarbonise the economy through electrification. Storage is one of the major challenges in the energy transition  hence this collaboration with the Norwegian group will be key to our strategy "" said Fernando Mateo  Global Head of Industrial Decarbonisation at Iberdrola.""This is a turning point for the Kyoto Group. Beyond the capital increase  the fact that both Iberdrola and Spirax-Sarco are vesting their plans  market access and credibility behind the commercialisation of Heatcube  opens up huge market opportunities and provides us with world-class technological support. We are already working on a number of customer-specific commercial projects with Iberdrola and expect to see positive results shortly  "" says Camilla Nilsson  CEO of the Kyoto Group.Alongside Iberdrola  the world leader in thermal energy management Spirax-Sarco will also invest in Kyoto.In addition to the commercial and technical cooperation for the commercialisation and market adoption of Heatcube  the investment will increase Kyoto's presence in Spain  where a third of its workforce and a large part of its suppliers are currently located  thus contributing to strengthening industry while generating a local value chain.Headquartered in Bilbao (Spain)  for over 20 years Iberdrola has been committed to clean energy with the goal of exceeding 52 000 MW of renewable capacity by 2025. Iberdrola recently presented its Climate Transition Plan to the United Nations  in response to the UN Secretary General's call  with the goal of achieving net zero emissions by 2040 following a realistic  ambitious and responsible path.The role of PERSEOIberdrola has materialised the investment in Kyoto through its start-up programme  PERSEO  which has helped the utility to implement innovative solutions to boost renewable energies  decarbonisation and electrification of the economy  digitalisation of grids  promotion of efficient storage and care for the environment.The programme's ecosystem includes more than 7 500 start-ups  including unicorns - companies valued at more than USD 1 billion - such as the electric vehicle charging solutions manufacturer Wallbox and Stem  which offers smart battery storage solutions.HeatcubeKyoto Heatcube offers thermal energy storage and heat generation in a single product. It provides industrial customers with the technology to reduce both their process heat production costs and CO2 emissions by using intermittent renewable energy sources instead of fossil fuels for heat production.Heatcube can store from 16 MWh to 96 MWh  with a discharge effect for each Heatcube of up to 15 MW. It is an innovative  low-cost  modular thermal energy storage solution that can use multiple renewable energy sources to heat molten salt to over 415 degrees. The high-temperature salt is then used to produce steam for industrial production processes.About Kyoto GroupHeat accounts for two-thirds of industrial energy consumption and  traditionally  almost all of it is based on fossil fuels. Kyoto Group's Heatcube  a thermal energy storage solution  provides a sustainable and cost-effective alternative by capturing and storing abundant but variable energy from sources such as solar and wind.

The result of a partnership between Safran Landing Systems  the world leader in landing systems  and Michelin  the world leader in the mobility sector  PresSense is intended to simplify airline maintenance operations. PresSense allows for remotely measuring aircraft tire pressures  just 45 minutes after landing. In comparison  most operators still perform these mandatory daily maintenance checks manually  using a pressure gauge positioned on the valve. However  in order to be performed in complete safety  the operation requires waiting for the tire to cool  i.e.  at least 3 hours after landing. PresSense comprises an electronic pressure measurement sensor  developed by Safran  integrated into a tire designed by Michelin. To check the tire pressures  maintenance agents simply need to place an RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) reader in front of the tire. The information is read instantly on a smartphone app and sent to a database. This offers airlines the option of performing subsequent analyses  intended  for example  for predictive maintenance operations  whereas the manual pressure measurements are not kept. By reducing the downtime of aircraft on the ground by over 2 hours every day  PresSense allows airlines to optimize the availability of their fleets and thus gain in competitive advantage. At fleet level  it also offers them the opportunity to reduce their operating costs  as the maintenance operations only take a few seconds. PresSense has been the subject of several successful operating tests with various airlines  allowing Safran and Michelin to now offer a mature solution. Michelin has been entrusted with marketing this innovative digital solution.François Bastin  Safran Landing Systems CEO: ""It was here in Le Bourget  in 2017  that we revealed our PresSense connected tire project in partnership with Michelin. Today  we're extremely proud to announce its first selection  by the Brazilian airline Azul. This milestone marks the completion of several years of work between our teams to refine this innovative  reliable  and high-performance solution  proven by multiple test flights. In particular  PresSense will allow our customer to optimize the downtime of its aircraft and may be used for predictive maintenance purposes."" Sophie Brechoire  President of the Michelin Group aeronautic activities: ""We are very honored by the trust Azul has placed in PresSense  the connected tire resulting from a partnership between Michelin and Safran. The selection of PresSense by Azul  a major player among the South American airlines  validates the relevance of our technical choices when developing this innovative technology. Azul will therefore be able to take full advantage of all the benefits linked to this solution: safety  digitization  and efficiency in its maintenance operations. A service offering that meets our customers' needs."" Flávio Costa  Technical Vice President at Azul Brazilian Airlines: ""Azul has established itself as a reference  not only in customer experience and services but also in aircraft maintenance and repairs. This expertise is shared with other companies through a different business unit  AzulTecOps. To match these high standards  we are always looking for innovations that can bring more efficiency  like PressSense and partners we can trust  such as Safran and the Michelin Group. Their unwavering dedication and commitment to excellence greatly contribute to our pursuit to be the best airline in the world"".

AlenuraTM is a patented  innovative  clinical-stage bladder instillation product candidate that combines lidocaine  a well-established anaesthetic  in a new alkalinized form with heparin  a glycoso-amino-glycan (GAG)  a component of bladder mucous membranes.AlenuraTM has the potential of becoming a first-line drug treatment for acute pain in patients with interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome.Thanks to the novel dual mode-of-action  AlenuraTM has the unique potential to i) immediately relieve pain  and ii) augment the mucous layer of the bladder. In previous controlled clinical trials4  AlenuraTM was well-tolerated and suggested the drug product candidate was more effective in terms of pain relief  urgency response and improvement of symptoms compared to placebo  heparin alone and lidocaine alone.Stijn Van Rompay  Chief Executive Officer of Hyloris  commented: “Currently there are no drug products specifically approved to treat acute bladder pain in patients with IC/BPS. AlenuraTM holds the promise of a ready-to-use solution to be administered by physicians. We are highly motivated to offer relief to these patients by improving the symptoms disrupting their daily lives.”“This ambitious phase 2 program includes additional clinical trials  potentially reducing time and number of patients needed in Phase 3 trials  in order to help patients waiting for an efficient treatment sooner rather than later.”Alenura TM is being developed in partnership with Vaneltix Pharma  Inc (Vaneltix)  the sponsor of the clinical trial. Hyloris has committed to staged investments of in total maximum USD 6.7 Mio for multiple Phase 2 trials (4-arm  multi-dosage  PK)  manufacturing and regulatory related activities  and a loan of USD 0.5 Mio.Hyloris will be eligible to receive a tiered percentage of the product margin generated by AlenuraTM.About this Phase 2 TrialVaneltix is the sponsor of the phase 2 clinical program. The primary endpoint will be to evaluate the change in Sum of bladder Pain Intensity Differences from baseline to 12 hours (SPID-12) after administration of AlenuraTM compared with the SPID-12 after administration of its individual active components (lidocaine and heparin)  and to placebo as determined by using the 11-point NRS (numerical rating scale) for bladder pain.The trial will enrol a target of 120 patients across multiple sites in the United States. Each subject will receive a single blinded dose of AlenuraTM  placebo  lidocaine  or heparin by random assignment.About Interstitial Cystitis/Bladder Pain Syndrome (IC/BPS) and AlenuraTMIC/BPS is a condition that results in recurring discomfort or pain in the bladder and surrounding pelvic region. The scientific team of Vaneltix  led by Dr. C. Lowell Parsons  a distinguished Professor Emeritus  Urologist and Surgeon  believes that ICS/BPS stems from an anatomical defect in the protective bladder lining (the GAG mucous layer) which exposes nerve endings to toxic components in urine. Patients often experience episodes of severe intensity pain lasting hours to days (painful flares)  which requires treatment. IC/BPS is more prevalent in women  although men can experience symptoms as well  and although underdiagnosed  it is estimated at least 6 million people in the U.S. suffer from the condition.AlenuraTM is a unique  combination product of alkalinised lidocaine and the glycosaminoglycan heparin. Alkalinised lidocaine penetrates the transitional epithelial cell layer and provides immediate pain relief. Whereas heparin sodium is thought to augment the natural mucous layer of the bladder to prevent further irritation of the bladder and prolong the anaesthetic effect. AlenuraTM will be supplied as a prefilled syringe for intra-vesicular administration to the bladder through an installation procedure and is protected by multiple patents and patent applications potentially providing exclusivity up to 2038.About HylorisHyloris is a specialty biopharma company focused on innovating  reinventing  and optimizing existing medications to address important healthcare needs and deliver relevant improvements for patients  healthcare professionals and payors.

Losses are even more pronounced on the mid-cap FTSE 250 because of its exposure to the UK.

Today  Aegon presents the next chapter of this transformation. Aegon CEO  Lard Friese  will be joined by CFO Matt Rider  Duncan Russell  Chief Transformation Officer  Will Fuller  CEO of Transamerica – Aegon’s largest business unit – and other members of the management team of Transamerica to outline their plans to create value. The event  entitled “Transforming Aegon – The Next Chapter ” follows the successful execution of the first phase of the company’s transformation that was announced at Aegon’s 2020 Capital Markets Day (CMD).Aegon CEO  Lard Friese  commented: “Today  Aegon is a more focused company with improved operational performance  a stronger balance sheet  and an enhanced risk profile. We have delivered on the plans outlined at our last Capital Markets Day. The transaction to combine Aegon’s Dutch pension  life and non-life insurance  banking  and mortgage origination activities with a.s.r. closes off the first chapter of Aegon’s transformation and enables us to accelerate the execution of our strategy.“At today’s CMD  we will outline the steps we are taking to ensure that Transamerica  our US subsidiary  captures its full potential. Transamerica has had a long and proud history of making financial services available to the many  not just the few. We aim to accelerate Transamerica’s growth and build America’s leading middle market life insurance and retirement company. This rapidly growing market  representing 68 million middle income households  is the largest in the US and is relatively underserved by the financial services industry. Transamerica is well positioned to grow and to capture the opportunities in this market ” said Lard Friese.Transamerica’s strategy consists of four focus areas. First  Transamerica will invest further in World Financial Group (WFG)  its insurance distribution network of around 70 000 independent agents. WFG distributes Transamerica products  as well as those of other insurers. Its distinctive  nationwide network is the third largest agency force in the United States and the largest in Canada. WFG’s agents come from a wide range of diverse cultural backgrounds  and meet the needs of the communities in which they operate. Transamerica’s ambition is to increase the number of WFG agents to 110 000 by 2027  while at the same time improving agent productivity.Second  Transamerica will invest in its product manufacturing capabilities and operating model in order to provide an improved and differentiated customer experience and to support sales growth. It will insource and redesign critical operational and administrative functions  including core customer services  that are currently managed by an external provider. As a result  Transamerica will be well positioned to grow its life insurance business sold through both WFG and third-party distributors.Third  in Workplace Solutions  Transamerica aims to increase earnings from its retirement business which provides recordkeeping and investment services for US defined contribution plans  and advice to plan participants. With a focus on the mid-sized and pooled employer retirement plan market  Transamerica will invest to leverage its capabilities as a recordkeeper with the ambition to materially increase the penetration of the ancillary products and services it offers. In particular  it will build on its expertise in stable value investment options and individual retirement savings accounts.Fourth  Transamerica will continue to reduce its exposure to Financial Assets and improve the level and predictability of its capital generation. Since the 2020 CMD  Aegon has released USD 1.5 billion of capital from its Financial Assets in the US. Looking forward  Transamerica will expand the scope of Financial Assets to include legacy Universal Life contracts  and take additional management actions which are expected to release another USD 1.2 billion of capital in the next five years. The financial flexibility this creates will be prioritized to further reduce exposure to Financial Assets.In addition to sharing its plans for Transamerica  Aegon will provide an update on the a.s.r. transaction  which is expected to be completed in the coming weeks. Shortly after closing  Aegon expects to initiate the associated capital return of EUR 1.5 billion as announced on October 27  2022  through a share buyback over a 12-month period. Post-closing  Aegon intends to hold its 29.99% strategic stake in a.s.r. to capture the value of cost and capital synergies associated with the integration of its former Dutch business into a.s.r.Aegon is making progress on the review of the implications of the transaction with a.s.r for group supervision. The discussions with the college of supervisors  representing all local regulators of Aegon  are ongoing and no decisions have been made. Any further details will be made available if and when appropriate. Regardless of the outcome  Aegon intends to maintain its head office in the Netherlands. Its shares will remain listed on Euronext in Amsterdam and the New York Stock Exchange.Aegon will continue to strengthen its UK business and its fully-owned global asset manager  and to support their journeys to build leadership positions. In addition  Aegon will invest in growing its various joint ventures in Aegon International and Asset Management. In 2024  Aegon will provide an update on its plans to deliver on the full potential of these businesses. Aegon’s near-term priority in the UK is to maintain expense discipline to create room for investments  and to drive sales growth in the Retail and Workplace channels on its platform. Aegon Asset Management is in the process of completing the implementation of its global operating platform. It will continue to focus on growing in alternative asset and retirement investment solutions  and will implement additional efficiency measures. In its joint ventures  Aegon will continue to create value by using its international expertise to leverage the knowledge of the local management teams.“As part of the next chapter in our transformation  we are adapting our organization and changing the operational set-up of the holding company. The business units will focus on delivering on their strategic objectives by improving customer experience and propositions  strengthening their operations and maintaining strong controls. The holding company will set the overarching strategic direction  identify and drive business opportunities  allocate capital in a rational and disciplined manner  manage performance tightly  set the risk appetite and actively manage risk. Lastly  we will take key talent management decisions. To mark these changes and to better reflect our company’s new profile  Aegon will operate with a refreshed logo ” said Lard Friese.Financial implications and financial targetsThe execution of Transamerica’s strategic plan is expected to result in a significant increase of the earnings on in-force from its Strategic Assets. Transamerica plans to reinvest part of its earnings on in-force from Strategic Assets in profitable new business to secure long-term growth. This is anticipated to result in a gradual increase in operating capital generation from Strategic Assets to fund growing remittances to the Holding. Transamerica targets a mid-single digit growth rate of its remittances in the medium-term  from a level of USD 550 million in 2023. The associated investments to achieve Transamerica’s strategic ambitions are expected to have a one-time impact of -15%-points on the US RBC ratio and reduce Aegon’s equity by around USD 450 million. The majority of these impacts are expected to be incurred in the second quarter of 2023.The additional actions that Transamerica has identified to reduce its exposure to Financial Assets include the intention to remove the remaining morbidity improvement assumption and increase the inflation assumption in its Long-Term Care business. Associated with these assumption changes  Transamerica will seek approvals for additional actuarially justified premium rate increases with a combined value of USD 700 million. In addition  Transamerica will take actions to mitigate the capital volatility caused by its annuity and universal life with secondary guarantees blocks of business. These management actions are expected to have a combined one-time impact of -5%-pts on the US RBC ratio and reduce Aegon’s equity by around USD 250 million. The majority of these impacts are expected to be incurred in the second quarter of 2023.Throughout its transformation  Aegon will ensure that it maintains sufficient capital in its business units and at the Holding so that management can focus its time and energy on increasing the return on capital  and distributing capital to shareholders. In Aegon’s capital management approach  the company will continue to focus on managing the capital positions of its business units to their respective operating levels over time. For Transamerica  the operating level remains at an RBC ratio of 400%. The RBC ratio was 436% on March 31  2023  which makes Transamerica well positioned to manage the RBC ratio to the operating level and to continue to pay its planned remittances even in the case of moderately adverse scenarios.The operating range for Cash Capital at Holding remains EUR 0.5 billion to EUR 1.5 billion. Aegon expects to reduce the Cash Capital at Holding from EUR 1.4 billion on March 31  2023  to around the mid-point of the operating range over time. Aegon intends to do so by returning capital to shareholders in the absence of value-creating opportunities  in line with its capital management approach. As previously indicated  Aegon will reduce its gross financial leverage by up to EUR 700 million following the closing of the transaction with a.s.r.  which brings it to around EUR 5.0 billion.By increasing its earnings and managing capital in a disciplined manner  Aegon expects to grow operating capital generation over the plan period and translate this into increasing free cash flow. Aegon expects its operating capital generation before holding funding and operating expenses to grow from at least EUR 1.0 billion in 2023 to around EUR 1.2 billion in 2025. Free cash flow is expected to grow in line with the anticipated growth in operating capital generation  and is anticipated to benefit from the expected growth in dividends to be received on Aegon’s strategic stake in a.s.r. As a result  Aegon expects to grow its free cash flow from around EUR 600 million in 2023 to around EUR 800 million in 2025. Dividends are expected to remain well covered by free cash flow. Furthermore  on a per share basis  dividends will benefit from the deployment of Aegon’s financial flexibility at the Holding. As a result  Aegon aims to grow its dividend per share from around EUR 0.30 over 2023 to around EUR 0.40 over 2025  barring unforeseen circumstances.ContactsMedia relations Investor relations Carolien van der Giessen Jan Willem Weidema +31(0) 6 11953367 +31(0) 70 344 8028 carolien.vandergiessen@aegon.com janwillem.weidema@aegon.comDigital media callToday at 08:00 hrs.

Today  Aegon presents the next chapter of this transformation. Aegon CEO  Lard Friese  will be joined by CFO Matt Rider  Duncan Russell  Chief Transformation Officer  Will Fuller  CEO of Transamerica – Aegon’s largest business unit – and other members of the management team of Transamerica to outline their plans to create value. The event  entitled “Transforming Aegon – The Next Chapter ” follows the successful execution of the first phase of the company’s transformation that was announced at Aegon’s 2020 Capital Markets Day (CMD).Aegon CEO  Lard Friese  commented: “Today  Aegon is a more focused company with improved operational performance  a stronger balance sheet  and an enhanced risk profile. We have delivered on the plans outlined at our last Capital Markets Day. The transaction to combine Aegon’s Dutch pension  life and non-life insurance  banking  and mortgage origination activities with a.s.r. closes off the first chapter of Aegon’s transformation and enables us to accelerate the execution of our strategy.“At today’s CMD  we will outline the steps we are taking to ensure that Transamerica  our US subsidiary  captures its full potential. Transamerica has had a long and proud history of making financial services available to the many  not just the few. We aim to accelerate Transamerica’s growth and build America’s leading middle market life insurance and retirement company. This rapidly growing market  representing 68 million middle income households  is the largest in the US and is relatively underserved by the financial services industry. Transamerica is well positioned to grow and to capture the opportunities in this market ” said Lard Friese.Transamerica’s strategy consists of four focus areas. First  Transamerica will invest further in World Financial Group (WFG)  its insurance distribution network of around 70 000 independent agents. WFG distributes Transamerica products  as well as those of other insurers. Its distinctive  nationwide network is the third largest agency force in the United States and the largest in Canada. WFG’s agents come from a wide range of diverse cultural backgrounds  and meet the needs of the communities in which they operate. Transamerica’s ambition is to increase the number of WFG agents to 110 000 by 2027  while at the same time improving agent productivity.Second  Transamerica will invest in its product manufacturing capabilities and operating model in order to provide an improved and differentiated customer experience and to support sales growth. It will insource and redesign critical operational and administrative functions  including core customer services  that are currently managed by an external provider. As a result  Transamerica will be well positioned to grow its life insurance business sold through both WFG and third-party distributors.Third  in Workplace Solutions  Transamerica aims to increase earnings from its retirement business which provides recordkeeping and investment services for US defined contribution plans  and advice to plan participants. With a focus on the mid-sized and pooled employer retirement plan market  Transamerica will invest to leverage its capabilities as a recordkeeper with the ambition to materially increase the penetration of the ancillary products and services it offers. In particular  it will build on its expertise in stable value investment options and individual retirement savings accounts.Fourth  Transamerica will continue to reduce its exposure to Financial Assets and improve the level and predictability of its capital generation. Since the 2020 CMD  Aegon has released USD 1.5 billion of capital from its Financial Assets in the US. Looking forward  Transamerica will expand the scope of Financial Assets to include legacy Universal Life contracts  and take additional management actions which are expected to release another USD 1.2 billion of capital in the next five years. The financial flexibility this creates will be prioritized to further reduce exposure to Financial Assets.In addition to sharing its plans for Transamerica  Aegon will provide an update on the a.s.r. transaction  which is expected to be completed in the coming weeks. Shortly after closing  Aegon expects to initiate the associated capital return of EUR 1.5 billion as announced on October 27  2022  through a share buyback over a 12-month period. Post-closing  Aegon intends to hold its 29.99% strategic stake in a.s.r. to capture the value of cost and capital synergies associated with the integration of its former Dutch business into a.s.r.Aegon is making progress on the review of the implications of the transaction with a.s.r for group supervision. The discussions with the college of supervisors  representing all local regulators of Aegon  are ongoing and no decisions have been made. Any further details will be made available if and when appropriate. Regardless of the outcome  Aegon intends to maintain its head office in the Netherlands. Its shares will remain listed on Euronext in Amsterdam and the New York Stock Exchange.Aegon will continue to strengthen its UK business and its fully-owned global asset manager  and to support their journeys to build leadership positions. In addition  Aegon will invest in growing its various joint ventures in Aegon International and Asset Management. In 2024  Aegon will provide an update on its plans to deliver on the full potential of these businesses. Aegon’s near-term priority in the UK is to maintain expense discipline to create room for investments  and to drive sales growth in the Retail and Workplace channels on its platform. Aegon Asset Management is in the process of completing the implementation of its global operating platform. It will continue to focus on growing in alternative asset and retirement investment solutions  and will implement additional efficiency measures. In its joint ventures  Aegon will continue to create value by using its international expertise to leverage the knowledge of the local management teams.“As part of the next chapter in our transformation  we are adapting our organization and changing the operational set-up of the holding company. The business units will focus on delivering on their strategic objectives by improving customer experience and propositions  strengthening their operations and maintaining strong controls. The holding company will set the overarching strategic direction  identify and drive business opportunities  allocate capital in a rational and disciplined manner  manage performance tightly  set the risk appetite and actively manage risk. Lastly  we will take key talent management decisions. To mark these changes and to better reflect our company’s new profile  Aegon will operate with a refreshed logo ” said Lard Friese.Financial implications and financial targetsThe execution of Transamerica’s strategic plan is expected to result in a significant increase of the earnings on in-force from its Strategic Assets. Transamerica plans to reinvest part of its earnings on in-force from Strategic Assets in profitable new business to secure long-term growth. This is anticipated to result in a gradual increase in operating capital generation from Strategic Assets to fund growing remittances to the Holding. Transamerica targets a mid-single digit growth rate of its remittances in the medium-term  from a level of USD 550 million in 2023. The associated investments to achieve Transamerica’s strategic ambitions are expected to have a one-time impact of -15%-points on the US RBC ratio and reduce Aegon’s equity by around USD 450 million. The majority of these impacts are expected to be incurred in the second quarter of 2023.The additional actions that Transamerica has identified to reduce its exposure to Financial Assets include the intention to remove the remaining morbidity improvement assumption and increase the inflation assumption in its Long-Term Care business. Associated with these assumption changes  Transamerica will seek approvals for additional actuarially justified premium rate increases with a combined value of USD 700 million. In addition  Transamerica will take actions to mitigate the capital volatility caused by its annuity and universal life with secondary guarantees blocks of business. These management actions are expected to have a combined one-time impact of -5%-pts on the US RBC ratio and reduce Aegon’s equity by around USD 250 million. The majority of these impacts are expected to be incurred in the second quarter of 2023.Throughout its transformation  Aegon will ensure that it maintains sufficient capital in its business units and at the Holding so that management can focus its time and energy on increasing the return on capital  and distributing capital to shareholders. In Aegon’s capital management approach  the company will continue to focus on managing the capital positions of its business units to their respective operating levels over time. For Transamerica  the operating level remains at an RBC ratio of 400%. The RBC ratio was 436% on March 31  2023  which makes Transamerica well positioned to manage the RBC ratio to the operating level and to continue to pay its planned remittances even in the case of moderately adverse scenarios.The operating range for Cash Capital at Holding remains EUR 0.5 billion to EUR 1.5 billion. Aegon expects to reduce the Cash Capital at Holding from EUR 1.4 billion on March 31  2023  to around the mid-point of the operating range over time. Aegon intends to do so by returning capital to shareholders in the absence of value-creating opportunities  in line with its capital management approach. As previously indicated  Aegon will reduce its gross financial leverage by up to EUR 700 million following the closing of the transaction with a.s.r.  which brings it to around EUR 5.0 billion.By increasing its earnings and managing capital in a disciplined manner  Aegon expects to grow operating capital generation over the plan period and translate this into increasing free cash flow. Aegon expects its operating capital generation before holding funding and operating expenses to grow from at least EUR 1.0 billion in 2023 to around EUR 1.2 billion in 2025. Free cash flow is expected to grow in line with the anticipated growth in operating capital generation  and is anticipated to benefit from the expected growth in dividends to be received on Aegon’s strategic stake in a.s.r. As a result  Aegon expects to grow its free cash flow from around EUR 600 million in 2023 to around EUR 800 million in 2025. Dividends are expected to remain well covered by free cash flow. Furthermore  on a per share basis  dividends will benefit from the deployment of Aegon’s financial flexibility at the Holding. As a result  Aegon aims to grow its dividend per share from around EUR 0.30 over 2023 to around EUR 0.40 over 2025  barring unforeseen circumstances.ContactsMedia relations Investor relations Carolien van der Giessen Jan Willem Weidema +31(0) 6 11953367 +31(0) 70 344 8028 carolien.vandergiessen@aegon.com janwillem.weidema@aegon.comDigital media callToday at 08:00 hrs.

Other partners in the consortium include Samsung Engineering  Korea East-West Power Co. (EWP)  Korea Southern Power Co. (KOSPO)  and FutureTech Energy Ventures Company Ltd. (a subsidiary of PTTEP).The ENGIE and POSCO led-consortium has been named the winner of land block (Z1-02) offered by Hydrom  the orchestrator and master planner of Oman's green hydrogen industry. Spanning 340 sq km  the concession block is located in Duqm  with downstream elements to be established at the Port of Duqm.The land block will include a total renewable energy capacity of approx. 5GW which comprises wind and solar power  in addition to battery energy storage (BESS) and a hydrogen plant that will produce 200 kilotons per annum (ktpa) of green hydrogen. The hydrogen will then be transported by a pipeline to the Special Economic Zone at Duqm where it will be converted into approximately 1.2 million tons per annum (mtpa) of green ammonia for export. The Commercial Operation Date (COD) is expected by 2030.""This venture marks a significant leap forward in its worldwide dedication to expediting the transition to low-carbon energy. With presence in Oman for more than a quarter-century  we reaffirm our unwavering commitment to supporting the energy transition in the country and the region. By joining forces with our consortium partners  we aim to unlock Oman's extraordinary renewable energy potential while capitalizing on their expertise and capabilities. Ultimately  this collaboration propels ENGIE toward its global ambitions of attaining a hydrogen capacity of 4GW by 2030."" expressed Frederic Claux  Managing Director Flexible Generation & Retail  AMEA and Country Manager GCC from ENGIE.In March 2022  POSCO and ENGIE signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to explore joint development opportunities for green hydrogen production and related infrastructure in the Middle East  Australia  and Latin America. This venture symbolizes a continuation of their combined efforts and a monumental stride in ENGIE's quest for net-zero carbon by 2045 and POSCO's ambition for a green hydrogen-based steel business by 2050.Her Excellency Véronique Aulagnon  Ambassador of France to Oman  said: ""France  as part of the European Union  and Oman share a common ambitious target to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. France commends the remarkable leadership by the Sultanate of Oman to scale up renewables in its energy mix and develop a strong green hydrogen portfolio. As the French Ambassador to Oman  I am delighted to see a major French company  Engie  who has been active in Oman for over two decades  become a part of this transformative venture in the Sultanate of Oman and confirm its position as a key player in the global energy transition. I am confident that this collaboration will yield significant results in terms of sustainable development and job creation""With strategic relevance for ENGIE and the involved nations  the project feeds into ENGIE's aim of generating 80GW of renewable capacity and 4 GW of electrolyzer capacity by 2030  thereby solidifying its global standing in the zero-carbon transition. The project is also in line with Korea's national decarbonization objective of a 40% carbon footprint reduction by 2030  and aids in realizing Oman's Vision 2040 that centers around energy transition and industry diversification.The project contract will last for a period of 47 years  broken down into a seven-year development and construction phase followed by a 40-year operational period  and is set to roll out within a month of the contract signing. Construction is projected to begin in 2027  with the first shipment of green ammonia to Korea planned for the second half of 2030  thereby marking a significant step in sustainable development. The consortium will carry out the feasibility and technical studies  in order to finalize the total capital expenditure requirement for the project.Click here to download the image: https://wetransfer.com/downloads/d8a53c14f1342ea67dc33aefad543cf720230622133142/1b426f2e53375ab3e72a4022a7756d2e20230622133202/24f461About ENGIE GroupENGIE is a global reference in low-carbon energy and services.

The Barryroe field is located in 338 feet (100 meters) of water  approximately 31 miles (50 kilometers) offshore Cork  Ireland. The field is one of the largest undeveloped oil and gas fields offshore Europe and has been assessed to contain approximately 350 million barrels of recoverable oil and gas  according to the company website.The company announced its intention to begin a wind-down of its business through a Creditors Voluntary Liquidation. The announcement came after Ireland’s Department of the Environment  Climate  and Communications (DECC) refused the company’s plan to develop the Barryroe field.According to a statement  in May 2023  DECC Minister Eamon Ryan did not grant Barryroe Offshore’s lease undertaking as he was not satisfied “with the financial capability of the applicants  having been assessed in accordance with the provisions of the Act of 1960  the 2007 Licensing Terms and the Financial Capability Assessment Guidance”. The DECC also commissioned an independent report  which said that the company did not comply with the guidelines.Barryroe Offshore was given until November 21 to provide further financial information regarding its capability for the project. On June 8  the company said it had around $193 400 (EUR 176 000) working capital remaining  which amounted to approximately three weeks of working capital taking into account its existing commitments.The Dublin-based company said it was in “discussions with major shareholders” for renewed funding  but said there was no guarantee that additional funding would be secured.Barryroe Offshore’s ordinary shares have been suspended from trading on the AIM and Euronext Growth due to its funding situation and its intention to initiate a voluntary liquidation. The shares will remain suspended until the company’s “funding situation is resolved” or the liquidation process is complete  in which case the share will be canceled  according to the release.“It has been a disappointing and deeply frustrating time for shareholders  management  and the Board”  Barryroe Offshore Chairman Peter Newman said. “The funding solution put in place in November 2022 secured €40 million held on deposit in escrow  ready to draw down as needed  sufficient to fully cover the costs of the proposed appraisal program.”“Notwithstanding that secured funding  in assessing the company's financial capability to deliver this commitment  the Minister has seen fit to apply his discretion  relying on reference to one  non-mandatory  'financial capability guideline'  arguably inconsistent with the limited scope of the work  thereby denying all efforts to progress appraisal of the Barryroe oil and gas field”  Newman said.“In consequence the country has lost an opportunity to improve Ireland's energy security  to reduce the emissions associated with importing oil and gas  to provide employment and future tax revenues  and to diversify the country's sources of primary energy supply”  Newman said.In March 2018  Providence Resources subsidiary Exola DAC and Lansdowne Celtic Sea Limited signed a farm-out agreement with privately owned Chinese company APEC for SEL 1/11  which contains the Barryroe oil accumulation. Barryroe is located in the north Celtic Sea Basin  off the south coast of Ireland.In September 2022  Providence Resources changed its name to Barryroe Offshore Energy after a shareholder vote. The new name “reflects the board’s ongoing and continuing focus on the Barryroe field”  according to the company website.To contact the author  email rteodoro.editor@outlook.com,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,negative,0.01,0.2,0.8,True,English,"['Barryroe Offshore Energy', 'Ireland', 'Operations', 'Providence Resources subsidiary Exola DAC', ""one, non-mandatory, 'financial capability guideline"", 'Barryroe Offshore Chairman Peter Newman', 'north Celtic Sea Basin', 'Lansdowne Celtic Sea Limited', 'Financial Capability Assessment Guidance', 'DECC Minister Eamon Ryan', 'Providence Resources plc', 'Standard Exploration Licence', 'future tax revenues', 'primary energy supply', '80 percent working interest', 'largest undeveloped oil', 'Barryroe Offshore Energy', 'Creditors Voluntary Liquidation', 'Barryroe oil assets', 'Barryroe oil accumulation', 'The Barryroe field', 'The Dublin-based company', 'The DECC', 'financial information', 'limited scope', 'energy security', 'working capital', 'liquidation process', 'recoverable oil', 'Irish government', '338 feet (100 meters', '350 million barrels', 'lease undertaking', '2007 Licensing Terms', 'independent report', 'three weeks', 'existing commitments', 'Euronext Growth', 'frustrating time', 'farm-out agreement', 'south coast', 'shareholder vote', 'continuing focus', 'additional funding', 'funding situation', 'funding solution', 'gas field', 'news release', 'major shareholders', 'ordinary shares', 'appraisal program', 'new name', 'company website', 'Chinese company', 'decision', 'plan', 'firm', 'Ireland', 'operations', 'SEL', 'water', 'Cork', 'Europe', 'intention', 'wind-down', 'business', 'announcement', 'Department', 'Environment', 'Climate', 'Communications', 'statement', 'May', 'applicants', 'accordance', 'provisions', 'Act', 'guidelines', 'November', 'project', 'June', 'account', 'discussions', 'guarantee', 'trading', 'AIM', 'case', 'disappointing', 'management', 'Board', 'place', 'deposit', 'escrow', 'costs', 'discretion', 'reference', 'efforts', 'consequence', 'country', 'opportunity', 'emissions', 'importing', 'employment', 'March', 'APEC', 'September', 'ongoing', 'author']",2023-06-22,2023-06-23,rigzone.com
26604,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.telecomtv.com/content/access-evolution/what-s-up-with-kpn-verizon-ses-and-intelsat-47813/,What’s up with… KPN  Verizon  SES and Intelsat  Access Evolution,KPN to splash €200m on Dutch MVNOVerizon claims slicing successSES and Intelsat end their M&A engagement,In today’s industry news roundup: Dutch national operator KPN is hoping to snap up Youfone to give it a strong position in the budget mobile and broadband service sector; Verizon says it has successfully tested end-to-end 5G slicing services; satellite giants SES and Intelsat have ended their merger talks; and much more!KPN is clearly in M&A mode! Having announced the acquisition of fibre access network assets from Primevest Venture Capital earlier this week  it is now splashing out €200m to acquire the Dutch operations of budget service provider Youfone  an MVNO (mobile virtual network operator) and ISP that has 540 000 mobile and fixed broadband customers in the Netherlands  offering its services over KPN’s infrastructure (so the Dutch national operator knows it well). “With this acquisition  KPN materially strengthens its position in the mobile and broadband markets  especially in the faster-growing no-frills segments ” noted KPN in its announcement about the deal. “KPN and Youfone expect to achieve further growth in the coming years by continuing the efficient operating model that Youfone has been able to successfully implement. The Youfone organisation will continue to operate independently within KPN to ensure that current and future Youfone customers continue to be served in the way they are used to ” added KPN. But while a deal has been agreed  it is far from sealed: The move needs to be approved by the competition authorities  which will look closely at just how much additional market power it would give KPN  and you can be sure that VodafoneZiggo and T-Mobile Netherlands will be raising objections.The slicing on the cake… US mega-operator Verizon claims to have successfully demonstrated network slicing over a commercial 5G network (its own network  natch – there’s no point in having one at home and then demonstrating your slicing skills on someone else’s equipment and systems). Commenting on the experiment  Adam Koeppe  senior vice president of technology planning at the telco  said: “Verizon recently established connections and passed data over multiple network slices in a completely commercial 5G environment. Matching network performance characteristics to specific application requirements  network slicing promises differentiated customer experiences to efficiently provide our customers with the type of service they need to complete the task they want to complete on our network and provide them an exceptional experience. The field demonstration shows initial capabilities of end-to-end  dynamic network resource provisioning on a 5G network.” In essence  the demo registered “a commercially available 5G smartphone” (Verizon is coy about the brand used) to multiple network slices and passed data  end-to-end  across the entire network via commercially available virtualised and non-virtualised RAN kit and Verizon’s own multi-vendor standalone core. The telco noted: “The test successfully accessed network slicing capabilities from the device and validated the ability for the device chipset  operating system  application  radio network base station  and the core of the network to work in harmony to demonstrate a full end-to-end path for data to travel on a virtual network slice.” In due course  Verizon added  network slicing will be made available to its customers as its cloud-native  containerised standalone core continues to evolve. The question  though  is “will it be better than sliced bread?”Plans for a $10bn merger of satellite giants SES and Intelsat have been abandoned  with SES simply stating that “discussions regarding a possible combination with Intelsat have ceased.” The two companies confirmed in late March that they were in talks to create a single satellite operator with annual revenues of about $4bn  but said all along that there was no certainty that a merger agreement would be reached. SES shareholders appear relieved at the news  as the company’s stock is trading up by more than 5% at €5.10 on the Euronext exchange. Intelsat has been a private company since it emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in February 2022.UK operator BT has struck a multimillion-pound deal (of an undisclosed amount) with the British Army  which will see it deliver a managed Wi-Fi service across 162 new military sites. For the next five years  BT will provide its service  called MOD Wi-Fi  across all buildings at the new sites  including offices  hangars  training facilities  technical accommodation and workshops  as well as recreational spaces. The telco noted that the move serves a “huge digital infrastructure boost  with a managed firewall built-in for enhanced security”. It is also believed it will pave the way for the rollout of “smart bases” across the UK  which is set to begin in the next 12 months  improving the digital experience for military personnel while “maximising building occupancy for more efficient energy consumption”. In the future  the service could expand to other military forces of the UK  including the Royal Air Force (RAF) and Royal Navy. BT has also been managing 200 sites of the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) in the UK  Cyprus and Germany.

Early conversations with some potential suitors  including private equity firm CVC Capital  were held last year  and now TIM’s CEO Pietro Labriola is testing the waters again to see if there are any willing takers for a stake in a growing unit that is valued at around €6bn and offers cloud  datacentre and security services to business users  according to Bloomberg.Former Vodafone CEO  Nick Read  has joined digital infrastructure firm EXA Infrastructure as its new chairperson. In its announcement  the company stated that Read and his vast telecoms industry experience will support its strategy to become “the undisputed leader in the pan-European and trans-Atlantic datacentre-to-datacentre connectivity business.” He is also expected to help with the network expansion plans of EXA  which describes itself as “the largest dedicated digital infrastructure platform connecting Europe and North America”  with a fibre network of 125 000 km spanning 34 countries. EXA Infrastructure’s CEO  Martijn Blanken  said Read is “a titan in our industry ” adding “I am convinced that his extensive leadership and technology experience will be invaluable to execute our ambitious growth strategy.” On his appointment  Read noted that he is joining EXA “at a pivotal time for the telecoms industry where we are seeing significant investment in digital infrastructure and market growth.” Read resigned from Vodafone’s top-job at the end of 2022 over pressure from investors amid slow transformation of the telco’s international portfolio and a net debt of €45.5bn – see Vodafone CEO Nick Read quits as investor pressure takes its toll. Meanwhile  Exa has been steadily growing its presence  especially in eastern Europe  which its CEO described in a TelecomTV interview as a region that is “very high on the list of priorities” – see How EXA Infrastructure rises to growing data demand challenges. Its most recent move involved the acquisition of Croatian telco Unitel.In Indonesia a digital avatar by the name of Nadira is now “reading” the news on television. The management of the popular and influential channel tvOne called the avatar a “metahuman”. Indeed  there are three such AI-supported  ostensibly female  quasi-hominids currently “working” for the channel  with more planned. Nadira’s un-nuanced blank-faced expression remains rigidly fixed  regardless of whether the news she is reading is good  bad or indifferent. Indeed  she is  by her very nature (or  more probably  lack of it)  utterly indifferent to whatever words she is programmed to speak  because she is not real. Her required very-well-rendered hijab and other clothing always remain absolutely pristine  as does what is visible of her elaborate coiffure. What’s more  she can speak perfectly modulated received pronunciation (RP) English  generic American English and flawless Bahasa Indonesian. The two other avatars in the metahuman conglomerate have been “crafted” to represent a specific Indonesian demographic  hence the Chinese-Indonesian-looking Sasya and Bhoomi  who/which is described as a curly-haired East Indonesian. They speak Chinese and a variety of local dialects  including Javanese and Sundanese. Nadira itself is modelled on a flesh-and-blood female human newsreader  Fahada Indi  who has been a news anchor at tvOne for the past four years. Her avatar speaks with Fahada Indi’s voice and mimics her movements. According to the news site Rest of World  Fahada Indi regards having an avatar modelled directly on her human characteristics as “an honour” rather than weirdness. Increasingly  the real woman reports live from across the length and breadth of Indonesia while her avatar sits behind a virtual desk in a studio speaking in her voice. Unfortunately  the AI-rendered metahuman cannot interact either with her real-life counterpart or with studio guests  which rather limits the gimmick  to say the least. The CEO of tvOne  Taufan Eko Nugroho  accepts and admits that the avatars are far from perfect and are conspicuously lacking aspects of “the human touch”  such as the all-important meaningful eye-contact and natural empathy that human newsreaders project and avatars just don’t. Nonetheless  metahumans are now a small but significant and growing part of daily life in Indonesia  with avatars based on singers and entertainers now positioned as important brand “influencers” in lifestyle advertising. Meanwhile  Nugroho of tvOne assured Rest of World that the station’s avatars have not replaced any human staff at the channel and there are no plans for them to do so. He didn’t add the word “yet”  but the future for all mankind is more of a creeping dystopia with every passing day. (PS. As you can probably tell  this was written by a human journalist  not some form of AI  unless you count the gratuitous input from my robot vacuum cleaner…).The European Commission has approved the creation of the economy of things joint venture  announced in early May  that is being set up by Vodafone Group and Sumitomo. Vodafone  which will hold an 80% stake in the venture  has already developed an economy of things platform  called Digital Asset Broker  which it will transfer into the new business  along with related intellectual property  contracts  technology and software. Sumitomo will invest in the new business and work with Vodafone to attract additional investors  partners and customers.
