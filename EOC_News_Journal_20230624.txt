26653,EuroNext,Bing API,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/inventiva-announces-presentation-scientific-abstract-060000029.html,Inventiva announces the presentation of a scientific abstract at the 83rd Scientific Sessions of the American Diabetes Association,Inventiva (Euronext Paris and Nasdaq: IVA)  a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of oral small molecule therapies for the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and other diseases with significant unmet medical needs ,INVENTIVADaix (France)  Long Island City (New York  United States)  June 24  2023 – Inventiva (Euronext Paris and Nasdaq: IVA)  a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of oral small molecule therapies for the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and other diseases with significant unmet medical needs  today announced that the abstract “Lanifibranor Improves Markers of Cardiometabolic Health in Patients with NASH and Type 2 Diabetes  Correlated With Responses in Adiponectin Levels” has been selected for poster presentation during the American Diabetes Association’s 83rd Scientific Sessions taking place on June 23-26  202 in San Diego  United States.Adiponectin plays a critical role in energy homeostatis by regulating insulin sensitivity  lipid metabolism and control of glycemia. In addition adiponectin has anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects in the liver. Low levels of adiponectin are associated with several metabolic conditions including T2D and NASH  and with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease. PPAR signaling is involved in disease pathways common to NASH and T2D  and this abstract evaluates the effect of lanifibranor  a pan-PPAR agonist  on adiponectin levels and improvement of markers of cardiometabolic health in patients with T2D and NASH.Inventiva’s ‘NATIVE’ Phase IIb clinical trial  which evaluated lanifibranor in patients with non-cirrhotic NASH  has demonstrated beneficial effects on liver histology  NASH resolution and fibrosis regression. The authors of the abstract show that lanifibranor significantly increases the levels of adiponectin and that this increase is correlated with the improvements of cardiometabolic markers  including insulin resistance  glycemic control  lipid metabolism  and systemic inflammation  in patients with NASH and T2D or prediabetes.The details of the presentation are as follows:Date: June 25  2023 Timing of the poster session: 11:30am-12:30 pm PT Poster identifier: 844-P Abstract title: “Lanifibranor Improves Markers of Cardiometabolic Health in Patients with NASH and Type 2 Diabetes  Correlated with Responses in Adiponectin Levels” Author: Dr. Louis Griffel  Vice President Clinical Development  InventivaAbout lanifibranorLanifibranor  Inventiva’s lead product candidate  is an orally-available small molecule that acts to induce anti-fibrotic  anti-inflammatory and beneficial vascular and metabolic changes in the body by activating all three peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) isoforms  which are well-characterized nuclear receptor proteins that regulate gene expression. Lanifibranor is a PPAR agonist that is designed to target all three PPAR isoforms in a moderately potent manner  with a well-balanced activation of PPARα and PPARδ  and a partial activation of PPARγ. While there are other PPAR agonists that target only one or two PPAR isoforms for activation  lanifibranor is the only pan-PPAR agonist in clinical development for the treatment of NASH. Inventiva believes that lanifibranor’s moderate and balanced pan-PPAR binding profile contributes to the favorable tolerability profile that has been observed in clinical trials and pre-clinical studies to date. The FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy and Fast Track designation to lanifibranor for the treatment of NASH.About InventivaInventiva is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the research and development of oral small molecule therapies for the treatment of patients with NASH  mucopolysaccharidoses (“MPS”) and other diseases with significant unmet medical need. The Company benefits from a strong expertise and experience in the domain of compounds targeting nuclear receptors  transcription factors and epigenetic modulation. Inventiva is currently advancing one clinical candidate  has a pipeline of two preclinical programs and continues to explore other development opportunities to add to its pipeline.Inventiva’s lead product candidate  lanifibranor  is currently in a pivotal Phase III clinical trial  NATiV3  for the treatment of adult patients with NASH  a common and progressive chronic liver disease for which there are currently no approved therapies.Inventiva’s pipeline also includes odiparcil  a drug candidate for the treatment of adult MPS VI patients. As part of Inventiva’s decision to focus clinical efforts on the development of lanifibranor  it suspended its clinical efforts relating to odiparcil and is reviewing available options with respect to its potential further development. Inventiva is also in the process of selecting an oncology development candidate for its Hippo signaling pathway program.The Company has a scientific team of approximately 90 people with deep expertise in the fields of biology  medicinal and computational chemistry  pharmacokinetics and pharmacology  and clinical development. It owns an extensive library of approximately 240 000 pharmacologically relevant molecules  approximately 60% of which are proprietary  as well as a wholly-owned research and development facility.Inventiva is a public company listed on compartment B of the regulated market of Euronext Paris (ticker: IVA  ISIN: FR0013233012) and on the Nasdaq Global Market in the United States (ticker: IVA). www.inventivapharma.comContactsInventivaPascaline ClercVP of Global External Affairsmedia@inventivapharma.com+1 240 620 9175 Brunswick GroupTristan Roquet Montegon /Aude Lepreux /Matthieu BenoistMedia relationsinventiva@brunswickgroup.com+33 1 53 96 83 83 Westwicke  an ICR CompanyPatricia L.
