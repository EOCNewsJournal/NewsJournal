26675,Clearstream,Bing API,https://delano.lu/article/the-fund-industry-is-going-thr,‚ÄúThe fund industry is going through a fundamental transformation‚Äù,June in Monaco  more than 300 industry professionals will talk about topics ranging from sustainable product development to the democratisation of private markets. Philippe Syell from Clearstream Banking gave Delano a sneak peek of his panel ahead of the conference.,Lydia Linna: You‚Äôll be speaking during a session that focuses on new ways technology can improve outcomes for stakeholders. Could you give a few examples of these technologies? What are some challenges associated with developing and integrating these technologies?Philippe Seyll: The adoption of new technologies is fundamental to our business and central to our aim of reducing complexity and increasing efficiency for all stakeholders. At Clearstream  we have a strategic focus on innovation. The technologies we employ essentially relate to improving communication between systems  shortening intermediary chains and facilitating reconciliation. Notably  we employ IT robots for repetitive operational tasks  document scanning with automated data extraction as well as supporting the smart use of distributed ledger technology in the funds processing chain.The challenges are twofold. First  we cannot do innovation for innovation‚Äôs sake  it must solve a real-world problem. Second  we must ensure adoption within the market. Interoperability between systems and efficiency are the key considerations  while ensuring reliability and safety of financial networks.What would you like the audience to take away from the presentation?The fund industry is going through a fundamental transformation  which is crucial to successfully adapting smart technology. The key is how innovative technology will effectively be employed to improve outcomes for all stakeholders. Front-to-back platforms like Clearstream Fund Centre use technology intelligently with the aim of reducing overall investment barriers and complexity--for our clients and the entire industry.This event is taking place in Monaco. From a Luxembourg perspective  why do you think this conference is interesting?It is clearly a key event for Luxembourg  as the largest fund domicile in Europe and a worldwide leader in cross-border distribution of funds. The event provides a highly effective way to meet all our industry counterparts in two days--clients  prospects and partners. This dialogue and active exchange with our peers and clients are essential. It also ensures we keep our finger on the pulse of our fund industry  year in  year out.The IMpower conference will feature more than 300 experts in the fund industry. Are there any particular sessions or speakers that you‚Äôre looking forward to at the conference  and why?Personally  I find sessions on regulatory topics are always very interesting to attend. This year  the sessions on developing private markets and the regulatory push for Eltif 2.0 will be of particular interest. Clearstream Fund Centre has been a leading private market custody and distribution platform in Europe for a decade with more than ‚Ç¨150bn assets under custody. Over recent years  Clearstream has supported the growth of private market funds with best-in-class services and has witnessed substantial growth in Eltifs on its Vestima platform. We are committed to continuously supporting the reutilisation of this asset class while optimising the processing complexity for our customers.Philippe Seyll is one of the participants of the ‚ÄúNew ways technology can improve outcomes for all stakeholders‚Äù session on 27 June.,neutral,0.13,0.87,0.0,mixed,0.67,0.2,0.13,True,English,"['fund industry', 'fundamental transformation', 'leading private market custody', 'repetitive operational tasks', 'automated data extraction', 'overall investment barriers', 'largest fund domicile', 'distributed ledger technology', 'private market funds', 'funds processing chain', 'The IMpower conference', 'Clearstream Fund Centre', 'New ways technology', 'private markets', 'fund industry', 'Lydia Linna', 'Philippe Seyll', 'strategic focus', 'intermediary chains', 'IT robots', 'smart use', 'real-world problem', 'financial networks', 'fundamental transformation', 'smart technology', 'innovative technology', 'back platforms', 'entire industry', 'worldwide leader', 'cross-border distribution', 'effective way', 'industry counterparts', 'active exchange', 'regulatory topics', 'regulatory push', 'particular interest', 'distribution platform', '‚Ç¨150bn assets', 'recent years', 'class services', 'Vestima platform', 'asset class', 'processing complexity', 'key considerations', 'new technologies', 'Luxembourg perspective', 'substantial growth', 'particular sessions', 'key event', 'outcomes', 'stakeholders', 'examples', 'challenges', 'adoption', 'business', 'aim', 'increasing', 'efficiency', 'innovation', 'communication', 'systems', 'reconciliation', 'sake', 'Interoperability', 'reliability', 'safety', 'audience', 'presentation', 'clients', 'place', 'Monaco', 'Europe', 'prospects', 'partners', 'dialogue', 'peers', 'finger', 'pulse', '300 experts', 'speakers', 'developing', 'Eltif 2.0', 'decade', 'Eltifs', 'reutilisation', 'customers', 'participants', '27 June']",2023-06-26,2023-06-26,delano.lu

Claude Debussylaan 88    1082 MD Amsterdam   The Financial Statements are approved by the Audit and Risk Committee on behalf of the Board on June 24  2023        ...https://www.mark‚Ä¶,"INFORMATION ON THE COMPANYReferences in this Annual Report to ""VEON"" as well as references to ""our company "" ""the company "" ""our group "" ""the group "" ""we "" ""us "" ""our"" and similar pronouns  are references to VEON Ltd.  an exempted company limited by shares registered in Bermuda  and its consolidated subsidiaries. References to VEON Ltd. are to VEON Ltd. alone.OverviewVEON is a leading global provider of connectivity and internet services. Present in some of the world's most dynamic markets  VEON currently provides more than 157 million customers with voice  fixed broadband  data and digital services (which excludes customers provided by the Group's Russian Operations which have been classified as a discontinued operations). VEON currently offers services to customers in the following countries: Pakistan  Ukraine  Kazakhstan  Bangladesh  Uzbekistan  and Kyrgyzstan. VEON's reportable segments currently consist of the following five segments: Pakistan  Ukraine  Kazakhstan  Bangladesh and Uzbekistan. Kyrgyzstan is not a reportable segment  we therefore  present our result of operations in Kyrgyzstan separately under ""Other"". We provide key services  among others  under the ""Kyivstar "" ""Banglalink "" and ""Jazz"" brands. As of December 31  2022  we had 16 422 employees. For a breakdown of total revenue by category of activity and geographic segments for each of the last three financial years  see -Operating and Financial Review and Prospects.Our predecessor PJSC VimpelCom (formerly OJSC ""VimpelCom"") was founded in 1992. In 1996  VimpelCom listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Its successor  VimpelCom Ltd.  a Bermuda company  remained listed on the New York Stock Exchange until 2013 when its listing moved to the NASDAQ Global Select Market. In March 2017  the company rebranded as VEON and on April 4  2017  VEON began trading its ordinary shares on Euronext Amsterdam. In October 2022  our listing was transferred to the NASDAQ Capital Market.In the early 2000s  we began an expansion into certain markets in Eastern Europe and Central Asia by acquiring local operators or entering into joint ventures with local partners  including  but not limited to  in Kazakhstan (2004)  Ukraine (2005)  Uzbekistan (2006)  Armenia (2006) and Georgia (2006). In 2009 and 2010  PJSC VimpelCom and Ukrainian mobile operator  Kyivstar  combined  and we subsequently established our headquarters in Amsterdam. In 2011  we completed the acquisition of Wind Telecom S.p.A.  an international provider of mobile and fixed-line telecommunications and internet services with operations in Italy  through Wind Telecom  and in Bangladesh and Pakistan  through Global Telecom Holding (GTH  previously known as Orascom Telecom Holding S.A.E.).In November 2016  the group combined its Italian mobile telecommunications business with that of CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd. in a joint venture company named Wind Tre. In July 2018  the group announced the sale of its 50% stake in Wind Tre to CK Hutchison Holdings Ltd. which was completed in September 2018. In July 2019  VEON Holdings B.V. launched a mandatory tender offer (""MTO"") to purchase the shares of GTH  a subsidiary of VEON which consolidated the group's operations in Bangladesh and Pakistan. At the close of the MTO in August 2019  VEON held approximately 98.24% of GTH's total outstanding shares. VEON subsequently embarked on a comprehensive restructuring of GTH  including a successful offer to acquire substantially all of GTH's operating assets in Pakistan and Bangladesh following the delisting of GTH from the Egyptian Exchange in September 2019. In late 2020  we sold our operating subsidiary in Armenia. In March 2021  the group successfully completed its acquisition of the 15% minority stake in Pakistan Mobile Communication Limited (""PMCL"")  its Pakistan operating business  from the Dhabi Group for US$273 million. In July 2021  VEON exercised its put option to sell the entirety of its 45.57% stake in its Algerian subsidiary  Omnium Telecom Alg√©rie SpA  which owns Algerian mobile network operator  Djezzy  to the Algerian National Investment Fund  Fonds National d'Investissement (FNI). Following the exercise of the put option for our stake in Algeria on July 1  2021  the sale of our stake in Djezzy Algeria was completed on August 5  2022 for a sale price of US$682 million. On November 24  2022  following a competitive process  we entered into an agreement to sell our Russian Operations to certain senior members of the management team of VimpelCom  led by its current CEO  Aleksander Torbakhov. Under the agreement  we will receive consideration of RUB 130 billion (approximately US$1 900 million equivalent). The SPA contains provisions amongst others that in the event VimpelCom acquires VEON Holdings B.V.'s debt in excess of the sales consideration  VEON will work with the purchasers to satisfy its obligations to them as a bondholder. The transaction is subject to certain closing conditions including the receipt of requisite regulatory approvals and licenses from relevant government authorities in Russia and Western jurisdictions (United States  United Kingdom  European Union  and Bermuda) for the proposed structure of the sale. As of June 24  2023  Russian regulatory approvals have been obtained as well as the OFAC license and required authorizations from the United Kingdom and Bermudan authorities. The remaining closing conditions to be satisfied include any required license from the European Union or any required consent from VEON creditors in order to cancel the debt provided as consideration and/or complete the sale. The result is that Russian Operations is classified as held-for-sale and discontinued operations and we no longer account for depreciation and amortization expenses of Russia assets.In late 2019  we announced a new strategic framework at the Group level to boost long-term growth beyond traditional connectivity services. This is laid out over three vectors: ""Infrastructure"" - its fundamental mobile and fixed line connectivity services and the drive of 4G adoption; ""Digital Operator"" - a portfolio of new services built around digital technologies with the active involvement of big data and artificial intelligence; and ""Ventures"" - assets which seeks to identify  acquire and develop ""know-how"" and technologies that open up adjacent growth opportunities. Since 2021  as part of our ""Digital Operator"" vector  our operating companies have been executing our ""digital operator 1440"" model pursuant to which we aim to enrich our connectivity offering with proprietary digital applications and services.

Pivotal data from the Phase 3 XTEND-Kids study evaluating ALTUVIIIOTM [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant)  Fc-VWF-XTEN Fusion Protein] once-weekly prophylaxis  a first-in-class  high-sustained factor VIII replacement therapy  in previously treated patients younger than 12 years of age with severe hemophilia A were presented today in a late-breaking session at the Annual Meeting of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) in Montreal  Canada.The oral presentation detailed results from the XTEND-Kids study and confirmed that ALTUVIIIO met the primary endpoint with no inhibitor development to factor VIII detected  and key secondary endpoints including annualized bleeding rate (ABR) and maintenance of factor VIII activity above pre-specified levels.In the pediatric population  clearance of administered factor concentrates in the blood is greater than in adults  often meaning injections are needed 2-4 times per week using standard (SHL) or extended half-life (EHL) factor VIII products. These data confirm that a once-weekly 50 IU/kg dose of ALTUVIIIO provides highly effective bleed protection in both children and adults and can be used across clinical scenarios.Hemophilia A is a rare  lifelong condition in which the ability of a person‚Äôs blood to clot properly is impaired  leading to excessive bleeds and spontaneous bleeds into joints that can result in joint damage and chronic pain  and potentially impact quality of life. The severity of hemophilia is determined by the level of clotting factor activity in a person‚Äôs blood  and there is a negative correlation between risk of bleeding and factor activity levels.ALTUVIIIO is a first-in-class  high-sustained factor VIII replacement therapy approved in February 2023 by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for routine prophylaxis and on-demand treatment to control of bleeding episodes  as well as perioperative management (surgery) for adults and children with hemophilia A. Granted Breakthrough Therapy designation by the FDA in May 2022 ‚Äî the first factor VIII therapy to receive this designation ‚ÄîALTUVIIIO also received Fast Track designation in February 2021 and Orphan Drug designation in 2017. The European Commission granted Orphan Drug designation in June 2019  and the European Medicines Agency accepted the Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for efanesoctocog alfa in May 2023.Lynn Malec  MDMedical Director of Comprehensive Center for Bleeding Disorders and Associate Investigator at The Versiti Blood Research Institute  and Associate Professor of Medicine and Pediatrics at The Medical College of Wisconsin‚ÄúThe results from XTEND-Kids mark an important breakthrough as we strive for optimized bleed protection as the standard of care. Achieving high-sustained factor activity with once weekly dosing means a freedom from the tradeoffs between treatment burden and efficacy we often see in treating severe hemophilia A. The reliable and consistent bleed protection ALTUVIIIO provides offers confidence for children living with hemophilia and their families to manage hemophilia with less worry.‚ÄùKarin Knobe  MD  PhDTherapeutic Area Head  Rare Diseases and Rare Blood Disorders  Sanofi‚ÄúIn an effort to reduce their risk of bleeding episodes  many children living with hemophilia A are currently limited in their ability to fully participate in daily activities. This burden is compounded by the challenge of administering prophylactic treatments intravenously multiple times a week. Today‚Äôs XTEND-Kids results reinforce the ability of ALTUVIIIO to provide effective bleed protection with once weekly dosing and reinforce our commitment to developing new treatment options designed to redefine the standard of care for people living with rare blood disorders.‚ÄùKey ResultsThe Phase 3 XTEND-Kids study (NCT04759131) was an open-label  non-randomized interventional study of the safety  efficacy  and pharmacokinetics of once-weekly ALTUVIIIO in previously treated patients younger than 12 years of age with severe hemophilia A. Patients (n=74) received once-weekly ALTUVIIIO prophylaxis (50 IU/kg) for 52 weeks.Development of Factor VIII inhibitors was not detected (0% [95% confidence interval (CI)] 0‚Äì4.9]).Median (interquartile range) and mean ABRs (95% CI) were 0.00 (0.00‚Äì1.02) and 0.89 (0.56‚Äì1.42)  respectively64% of patients had zero bleeding episodes  82% of patients had zero joint bleeds and 88% of patients had zero spontaneous bleedsIn this study  ALTUVIIIO was well-tolerated and demonstrated a safety profile similar to the XTEND-1 trial  confirming safety and efficacy in both adults and children.No serious allergic reactions  anaphylaxis  or embolic or thrombotic events were reported. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (>10%) were SARS-CoV-2 test positive  upper respiratory tract infection  and fever (pyrexia). No adverse events led to treatment discontinuation.About ALTUVIIIO‚Ñ¢ALTUVIIIO [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant)  Fc-VWF-XTEN Fusion Protein-ehtl] is a first-in-class high-sustained factor VIII therapy that is designed to extend protection from bleeds with once-weekly prophylactic dosing for adults and children with hemophilia A. In adults and adolescents  ALTUVIIIO has a 3 to 4 fold longer half-life relative to standard and extended half-life factor VIII products  providing high-sustained factor activity levels within normal to near-normal range  allowing for once weekly administration in both children and adults. ALTUVIIIO is the first factor VIII therapy that has been shown to break through the von Willebrand factor ceiling  which imposes a half-life limitation on earlier generation factor VIII therapies. ALTUVIIIO builds on the innovative Fc fusion technology by adding a region of von Willebrand factor and XTEN¬Æ polypeptides to extend its time in circulation.About the XTEND Clinical ProgramsThe XTEND clinical program is comprised of two Phase 3 trials in hemophilia A: XTEND-1 in people 12 years or older and XTEND-Kids in children younger than 12 years old. There is also an ongoing extension study (XTEND-ed).The Phase 3 XTEND-1 study (NCT04161495) was an open-label  non-randomized interventional study assessing the safety  efficacy  and pharmacokinetics of once-weekly ALTUVIIIO in people 12 years of age or older (n=159) with severe hemophilia A who were previously treated with factor VIII replacement therapy. The study consisted of two parallel treatment arms ‚Äî the prophylaxis Arm A (n=133)  in which patients who had received prior factor VIII prophylaxis were treated with once-weekly intravenous ALTUVIIIO prophylaxis (50 IU/kg) for 52 weeks  and the on-demand Arm B (n=26)  in which patients who had received prior on-demand factor VIII therapy began with 26 weeks of on-demand ALTUVIIIO (50 IU/kg)  then switched to once-weekly prophylaxis with ALTUVIIIO (50 IU/kg) for an additional 26 weeks.The primary efficacy endpoint of XTEND-1 was the mean annualized bleeding rate (ABR) in Arm A  and the key secondary endpoint was an intra-patient comparison of ABR during the ALTUVIIIO weekly prophylaxis treatment period versus the prior factor VIII prophylaxis ABR for a subset of participants in Arm A who had participated in a previous observational study (Study 242HA201/OBS16221).The XTEND-Kids study (NCT04759131) was an open-label  non-randomized interventional study of the safety  efficacy  and pharmacokinetics of once-weekly ALTUVIIIO in previously treated patients younger than 12 years of age with severe hemophilia A. Patients received once-weekly ALTUVIIIO prophylaxis (50 IU/kg) for 52 weeks. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of inhibitor development.About the Sanofi and Sobi collaborationSobi and Sanofi collaborate on the development and commercialization of Alprolix¬Æ and Elocta¬Æ/Eloctate¬Æ.

Factor VIII inhibitor development was not detected during the study. Once-weekly efa‚Ä¶,"XTEND-Kids data confirms the efficacy and safety profile of efanesoctocog alfa with 50 IU/kg dosing in previously treated children as already shown in adults and adolescents. Factor VIII inhibitor development was not detected during the study.Once-weekly efanesoctocog alfa was shown to sustain FVIII levels in the normal near-normal range (above 40%) for approximately 3 days in patients under 12 years of age  providing effective bleed protection throughout the weekly dosing interval.STOCKHOLM  June 25  2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Pivotal data from the Phase 3 XTEND-Kids study evaluating efanesoctocog alfa [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant)  Fc-VWF-XTEN Fusion Protein] once-weekly prophylaxis in previously treated patients younger than 12 years of age with severe haemophilia A were presented today in a late-breaking session at the Annual Meeting of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) in Montreal  Canada.The oral presentation detailed results from the XTEND-Kids study and confirmed that efanesoctocog alfa met the primary endpoint  occurrence of inhibitor development  and secondary endpoints including annualised bleeding rate (ABR) In the paediatric population  clearance of administered factor concentrates in the blood is greater than in adults  often requiring multiple injections per week using SHL or EHL factor VIII products. These data confirm that a once-weekly 50 IU/kg dose of efanesoctocog alfa provides highly effective bleed protection in both children and adults and can be used across all clinical scenarios.""Haemophilia A is often diagnosed at a very young age. The requirement for haemophilia patients to be careful in their physical activities to prevent bleeding episodes and joint injuries is especially challenging for young children. They also need frequent infusions of prophylactic treatments. The results from XTEND-Kids demonstrate that efanesoctocog alfa offers highly effective bleed protection also for paediatric patients  with a once-weekly dosing. This is encouraging  as it highlights its potential to become a new standard of care for haemophilia A in patients of all age groups "" said Lydia Abad-Franch  MD  PhD  Head of Research & Development and Medical Affairs and Chief Medical Officer at Sobi.Key ResultsThe Phase 3 XTEND-Kids study (NCT04759131) was an open-label  non-randomised interventional study of the safety  efficacy  and pharmacokinetics of once-weekly efanesoctocog alfa in previously treated patients younger than 12 years of age with severe haemophilia A. Patients (n=74) received once-weekly efanesoctocog alfa prophylaxis (50 IU/kg) for a mean duration of 51 weeks.¬∑ Development of Factor VIII inhibitors was not detected (0% [95% confidence interval (CI)] 0‚Äì4.9]).¬∑ Efanesoctocog alfa was well-tolerated and demonstrated a safety profile consistent with the XTEND-1 trial  confirming safety in both adults and children.¬∑ No serious allergic reactions  anaphylaxis  or embolic or thrombotic events were reported. No adverse events led to treatment discontinuation.¬∑ Median (interquartile range) and mean ABRs (95% CI) were 0.00 (0.00‚Äì1.02) and 0.89 (0.56‚Äì1.42)  respectively.¬∑ 64% of patients had zero bleeding episodes  82% of patients had zero joint bleeds and 88% of patients had zero spontaneous bleeds.¬∑ Pharmacokinetic results showed that weekly efanesoctocog alfa prophylaxis provided FVIII levels above 40% for approximately 3 days and above 10% at approximately day 7Haemophilia A is a rare  lifelong condition in which the ability of a person's blood to clot properly is impaired  leading to excessive and spontaneous bleeds into joints that can result arthropathy and chronic pain  and potentially impact quality of life. The severity of haemophilia is determined by the level of clotting factor activity in a person's blood  and there is a negative correlation between risk of bleeding and factor activity levels.Efanesoctocog alfa  commercialised as ALTUVIIIO‚Ñ¢ in the United States  is a new class of high-sustained factor VIII (FVIII) replacement therapy approved in February 2023 by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for routine prophylaxis and on-demand treatment to control of bleeding episodes  as well as perioperative management (surgery) for adults and children with haemophilia A. Granted Breakthrough Therapy designation by the FDA in May 2022 ‚Äì the first FVIII therapy to receive this designation‚ÄîALTUVIIIO also received Fast Track designation in February 2021 and Orphan Drug designation in 2017. The European Commission granted Orphan Drug designation in June 2019  and the European Medicines Agency accepted the Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for efanesoctocog alfa in May 2023.About XTEND-KidsThe XTEND-Kids study (NCT04759131) was an open-label  non-randomized interventional study of the safety  efficacy  and pharmacokinetics of once-weekly ALTUVIIIO in previously treated patients younger than 12 years of age with severe hemophilia A. Patients received once-weekly ALTUVIIIO prophylaxis (50 IU/kg) for 52 weeks which provided high-sustained FVIII levels throughout the weekly dosing interval with a median (IQR) annualized bleeding rate (ABR) of 0.00 (0.00  1.02) and an estimated mean (95% CI) ABR of 0.89 (0.56 ; 1.42). The primary endpoint was the occurrence of inhibitor development (baseline to 52 weeks). No inhibitors were detected in this study.About the XTEND Clinical ProgramsThe XTEND clinical program is comprised of two Phase 3 trials in hemophilia A: XTEND-1 in people 12 years or older and XTEND-Kids in children younger than 12 years old. There is also an ongoing extension study (XTEND-ed).The Phase 3 XTEND-1 study (NCT04161495) was an open-label  non-randomized interventional study assessing the safety  efficacy  and pharmacokinetics of once-weekly ALTUVIIIO in people 12 years of age or older (n=159) with severe hemophilia A who were previously treated with factor VIII replacement therapy. The study consisted of two parallel treatment arms ‚Äî the prophylaxis Arm A (n=133)  in which patients who had received prior factor VIII prophylaxis were treated with once-weekly intravenous ALTUVIIIO prophylaxis (50 IU/kg) for 52 weeks  and the on-demand Arm B (n=26)  in which patients who had received prior on-demand factor VIII therapy began with 26 weeks of on-demand ALTUVIIIO (50 IU/kg)  then switched to once-weekly prophylaxis with ALTUVIIIO (50 IU/kg) for an additional 26 weeks.The primary efficacy endpoint of XTEND-1 was the mean annualized bleeding rate (ABR) in Arm A  and the key secondary endpoint was an intra-patient comparison of ABR during the ALTUVIIIO weekly prophylaxis treatment period versus the prior factor VIII prophylaxis ABR for a subset of participants in Arm A who had participated in a previous observational study (Study 242HA201/OBS16221).The XTEND-Kids study (NCT04759131) was an open-label  non-randomized interventional study of the safety  efficacy  and pharmacokinetics of once-weekly ALTUVIIIO in previously treated patients younger than 12 years of age with severe hemophilia A. Patients received once-weekly ALTUVIIIO prophylaxis (50 IU/kg) for 52 weeks. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of inhibitor development.About the Sanofi and Sobi collaborationSobi and Sanofi collaborate on the development and commercialization of Alprolix¬Æ and Elocta¬Æ/Eloctate¬Æ.
