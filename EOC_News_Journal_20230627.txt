Holders of Notes must validly tender and not validly withdraw their Notes at or before 5:00 p.m.  New York City time  on July 10  2023  unless extended (such date and time  as the same may be extended  the “Early Tender Deadline”)  to be eligible to receive the applicable Total Consideration (as set forth in the table above) for their tendered Notes  which includes an early tender payment of $30 per $1 000 principal amount of the Notes accepted for purchase (the “Early Tender Premium”) as set forth in the table above. The “Total Consideration” for each $1 000 principal amount of Notes of any Series tendered and accepted for purchase pursuant to the Tender Offer will be determined in the manner described in the Offer to Purchase by reference to the applicable fixed spread (the “Fixed Spread”) specified for such Series (as set forth in the table above) over the yield (the “Reference Yield”) corresponding to the bid-side price of the applicable Reference U.S. Treasury Security specified for such Series in the table above (the “Reference U.S. Treasury Security”)  as calculated by BofA Securities  Inc. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC at 10:00 a.m.  New York City time  on July 11  2023 (such time and date  as the same may be extended  the “Price Determination Time”). Assuming the Tender Offer is not extended and the conditions to the Tender Offer are satisfied or waived  HP expects that settlement for Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn on or before the Early Tender Deadline  and for Notes validly tendered after the Early Tender Deadline and on or before the Expiration Time  will be on July 27  2023 (the “Settlement Date”).

Holders whose Notes are accepted for purchase pursuant to the Tender Offer will also receive accrued and unpaid interest on their purchased Notes from the last interest payment date for such Notes to  but excluding  the Settlement Date.HP reserves the right to increase or decrease the Maximum Amount at its own discretion. Accordingly  Holders should not tender any Notes that they do not wish to be accepted for purchase. If Holders tender more Notes than they expect to be accepted for purchase by HP  based on the Acceptance Priority Level (as defined below) of the Notes being tendered  and HP subsequently accepts more of such Notes tendered and not validly withdrawn on or before the Withdrawal Deadline  such Holders will not be able to withdraw any of their previously tendered Notes.The amount of each Series of Notes that is purchased pursuant to the Tender Offer on the Settlement Date will be subject to proration as described further below and determined in accordance with the acceptance priority levels specified in the table above and on the cover page of the Offer to Purchase in the column entitled “Acceptance Priority Level” (the “Acceptance Priority Level”)  with 1 being the highest Acceptance Priority Level and 5 being the lowest Acceptance Priority Level.All Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn on or before the Early Tender Deadline having a higher Acceptance Priority Level will be accepted before any tendered Notes having a lower Acceptance Priority Level are accepted in the Tender Offer  and all Notes validly tendered after the Early Tender Deadline having a higher Acceptance Priority Level will be accepted before any Notes tendered after the Early Tender Deadline having a lower Acceptance Priority Level are accepted in the Tender Offer. Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn on or before the Early Tender Deadline will be accepted for purchase in priority to other Notes tendered after the Early Tender Deadline  even if such Notes tendered after the Early Tender Deadline have a higher Acceptance Priority Level than the Notes tendered on or before the Early Tender Deadline.If the Purchase Price of the Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn on or prior to the Early Tender Deadline exceeds the Maximum Amount  the amount of such Notes purchased on the Settlement Date will be prorated and HP will accept for purchase only a combined aggregate principal amount of such Notes that will not result in the Purchase Price of such Notes exceeding the Maximum Amount  and none of the Notes  if any  validly tendered after the Early Tender Deadline will be accepted for purchase regardless of the Acceptance Priority Level of such Notes. If Notes are validly tendered and not validly withdrawn such that the Purchase Price of such Notes does not exceed the Maximum Amount on or before the Early Tender Deadline but exceeds the Maximum Amount at the Expiration Time  no proration will be applied to any Series of the Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn on or before the Early Tender Deadline  and  with respect to the Notes validly tendered after the Early Tender Deadline  HP will accept for purchase only a combined aggregate principal amount of such Notes in accordance with the Acceptance Priority Levels (with 1 being the highest Acceptance Priority Level and 5 being the lowest Acceptance Priority Level) such that the Purchase Price of such Notes accepted for purchase on the Settlement Date will not exceed the Maximum Amount.Subject to applicable law  the Tender Offer may be amended  extended  terminated or withdrawn with respect to one or more Series of Notes at any time.

The “Total Consideration” for each $1 000 principal amount of Notes of any Series tendered and accepted for purchase pursuant to the Tender Offer will be determined in the manner described in the Offer to Purchase by reference to the applicable fixed spread (the “Fixed Spread”) specified for such Series (as set forth in the table above) over the yield (the “Reference Yield”) corresponding to the bid-side price of the applicable Reference U.S. Treasury Security specified for such Series in the table above (the “Reference U.S. Treasury Security”)  as calculated by BofA Securities  Inc. and J.P.

Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn on or before the Early Tender Deadline will be accepted for purchase in priority to other Notes tendered after the Early Tender Deadline  even if such Notes tendered after the Early Tender Deadline have a higher Acceptance Priority Level than the Notes tendered on or before the Early Tender Deadline.If the Purchase Price of the Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn on or prior to the Early Tender Deadline exceeds the Maximum Amount  the amount of such Notes purchased on the Settlement Date will be prorated and HP will accept for purchase only a combined aggregate principal amount of such Notes that will not result in the Purchase Price of such Notes exceeding the Maximum Amount  and none of the Notes  if any  validly tendered after the Early Tender Deadline will be accepted for purchase regardless of the Acceptance Priority Level of such Notes. If Notes are validly tendered and not validly withdrawn such that the Purchase Price of such Notes does not exceed the Maximum Amount on or before the Early Tender Deadline but exceeds the Maximum Amount at the Expiration Time  no proration will be applied to any Series of the Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn on or before the Early Tender Deadline  and  with respect to the Notes validly tendered after the Early Tender Deadline  HP will accept for purchase only a combined aggregate principal amount of such Notes in accordance with the Acceptance Priority Levels (with 1 being the highest Acceptance Priority Level and 5 being the lowest Acceptance Priority Level) such that the Purchase Price of such Notes accepted for purchase on the Settlement Date will not exceed the Maximum Amount.Subject to applicable law  the Tender Offer may be amended  extended  terminated or withdrawn with respect to one or more Series of Notes at any time.

The shares have been held in Russia by a different depositary bank.In the circular  Deutsche attributed the shortfall to a decision by Moscow to allow investors to convert some of the DRs into local stock. The conversion was carried out without the German bank's ""involvement or oversight"" and Deutsche was unable to reconcile the company shares with the depositary receipts.It is the first major bank to formally inform depositary receipt holders that they may not get take ownership of precisely all the shares they are entitled to  two sources advising investors who continue to hold Russian DRs told Reuters.DRs are certificates issued by a bank representing shares in a foreign company traded on a local stock exchange. Swapping DRs for shares in the Russian company is a first step towards an effort to recover their money.A police vehicle drives behind an Airbus A321-211 aircraft of Russian airline Aeroflot with registration VP-BOE on a long term parking at Cointrin airport in Geneva  Switzerland  March 9  2022. REUTERS/Denis BalibouseShares affected include those in national airline Aeroflot  construction firm LSR Group  mining and steel firm Mechel and Novolipetsk Steel. Mechel declined to comment  while the remaining companies did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comments.Western sanctions and Russian countermeasures have stranded assets held by citizens and companies on both sides of the political divide. Moscow is also demanding a 10% contribution to the federal budget  termed an ""exit tax"" by Washington.The Kremlin has also taken assets under temporary control  seizing the Russian subsidiaries of two European energy firms in April  underscoring a strategy to lessen foreign influence on companies critical of its economic and political interests.A significant number of investors ranging from small hedge funds to big global asset managers still hold depositary receipts  investor sources said.Most investors have marked down Russian assets to zero but some still harbour hopes of recovering value in the future.Irina Tsukerman  president at geopolitical risk consultancy Scarab Rising  said the news should come as no surprise.""Literally everything in Russia has been vulnerable  whether its these DRs  equities  real estate or any other form of financial asset "" she told Reuters.The Central Bank of Russia did not immediately comment on the matter.Russia's National Settlement Depository said the conversion of shares had been carried out in accordance with Russian legislation and that it was not the accounting institution responsible for implementing this mechanism.'COMPLETE CHAOS'Lawyers and other advisers have described the conversion process as ""complete chaos"".""To a certain extent  this resulted in double counting because  without a reconciliation between Russia and foreign banks  an investor could get Russian shares and still hold the DRs at the foreign bank "" said Grigory Marinichev  a partner at law firm Morgan Lewis.Deutsche Bank is now allowing investors to swap DRs for shares as part of its plans to exit all Russia business  one source said.The bank also determined that clients could be in a better position if they could convert their DRs at least partially  this person added.JPMorgan & Chase  Citigroup and BNY Mellon act as depositary banks for most other Russian depositary receipt programs  according to Clearstream.All three banks declined to comment on whether they had also identified shortfalls  but their books remain closed due to the challenges with reconciliation  according to statements on their websites.Deutsche said in its circular that if it was able to reconcile its books at a later date  then it would look to return more shares to their rightful owners.But it cautioned that the net proceeds from sales of shares it was able to return to investors would likely be ""substantially lower"" than the current market price.The bank said it understood Russia's Government Commission for Control over Foreign Investments required that such shares be sold ""at a discount of at least 50% from their appraised market value "" the circular said.(Reporting by Sinead Cruise in London and Carolina Mandl in New York;

This rights offering is addressed exclusively to existing Delignit AG shareholders Delignit AG Blomberg ISIN DE000A0MZ4B0; WKN A0MZ4B Notification of a rights offering to the shareholders of Delignit AG The Annual General Meeting of Delignit AG  Blomberg (the ""Company"") authorised the Company's Management Board by resolution of 25 August 2020  entered in the Commercial Register on 21 September 2020  with the approval of the Supervisory Board  to increase the Company's share capital by up to EUR 4 096 950.00 by 24 August 2025 against cash deposits or contributions in kind by issuing new no-par value bearer shares (Authorised Capital 2020). Exercising this authorisation  the Management Board - with the approval of the Company's Supervisory Board from 20 June 2023 - resolved on 20 June 2023 to increase the Company's share capital from EUR 8 193 900.00 by up to EUR 2 048 475.00 against cash deposits by issuing up to 2 048 475 new no-par value bearer shares  each with a pro rata amount of the Company's share capital of EUR 1.00 and full dividend entitlement with effect from 1 January 2022 (""New Shares""). In the same resolution  the Management Board - with the approval of the Supervisory Board - set the subscription price at EUR 3.90 (""Subscription Price"") and the subscription ratio at 4:1. The Company grants the shareholders the option to oversubscribe unsubscribed New Shares. It was resolved to grant the shareholders subscription rights  whereby the New Shares are acquired by a bank selected and commissioned by the Company's Management Board with the obligation to offer them to the shareholders for subscription (indirect subscription right). On the basis of a share acquisition agreement with the Company dated 20 June 2023 (the ""Acquisition Agreement"")  Pareto Securities AS  Frankfurt Branch  Graefstrasse 97 60487 Frankfurt am Main  Germany (""Pareto AS"") undertook to offer the New Shares or shares of the same class and with the same rights to the Company's shareholders in the form of an indirect subscription right (""Rights Offering""). All existing Company shares with ISIN DE000A0MZ4B0/ WKN A0MZ4B are entitled to subscribe for the New Shares. The subscription rights ISIN DE000A35JST4/ WKN A35JST are automatically booked to the custodian banks on 27 June 2023 (Payment Date) as at 23 June 2023 (Record Date) by Clearstream Banking AG  Mergenthalerallee 61  65760 Eschborn. The custodian banks are responsible for ensuring that the subscription rights are booked to the authorised custody accounts of the Company's existing shareholders. From 27 June 2023 onwards (ex-dividend date)  the subscription rights (ISIN DE000A35JST4/ WKN A35JST) are separated from the Company's existing shares in the amount of the existing subscription right as per the Rights Offering and existing Company shares are listed ""ex subscription right"". To avoid exclusion from participation in the capital increase  the Company asks its shareholders to exercise their subscription rights to the New Shares in the period from 27 June 2023 up to and including 11 July 2023 (""Subscription Period"") through their custodian bank at Quirin Privatbank AG  Berlin  which acts as the settlement agent for Pareto AS (""Settlement Agent"")  during normal business hours. Shareholders are recommended to follow the instructions of their custodian banks. Subscription rights not exercised during the Subscription Period expire. There is no compensation for unused subscription rights. Subscription ratio In accordance with the subscription ratio of 4:1  a shareholder can subscribe for 1 (one) New Share at the subscription price for every 4 (four) old shares. The subscription right cannot be exercised if the subscription ratio set as part of this capital increase results in shareholder claims to fractions of shares. Accordingly  shareholders can exercise their subscription right exclusively for one New Share or a full multiple of a New Share. The declaration regarding the exercising of the subscription right is binding upon receipt by the Settlement Agent and may not be amended. However  exercising the subscription right is subject to the capital increase being entered in the commercial register and to the further restrictions listed below under ""Important information"".Subscription Price The Subscription Price of EUR 3.90 per New Share was determined by the Management Board with the approval of the Supervisory Board on 20 June 2023. The Subscription Price is payable at the time of exercising the subscription right and by no later than 11 July 2023 (date payment received). Exercising subscription rights To exercise the subscription right  we ask that our shareholders issue instructions to their custodian bank using the subscription order provided by the custodian banks. The custodian banks are asked to collect the shareholders' subscription exercises and submit them to the Settlement Agent by no later than the end of the Subscription Period and to pay the Subscription Price by no later than the end of the Subscription Period to the following account of Quirin Privatbank AG: Account holder: Quirin Privatbank AG IBAN: DE19101106009162715900 Bank: Quirin Privatbank AG Address: Bürgermeister-Smidt-Strasse 76  28195 Bremen Sort code: 10110600 BIC (SWIFT code): QUBKDEBBXXX Payment reference: Bezug Kapitalerhöhung Delignit AG Compliance with the Subscription Period is determined by when the subscription order and the Subscription Price are received by the Settlement Agent. Subscription rights not exercised on time expire without compensation and are derecognised after the end of the Subscription Period. There is no compensation for unused subscription rights. Compliance with the period is determined by when the subscription orders and the Subscription Price are received by the Settlement Agent. The Subscription Price must be credited to the account stated on time in order for the subscription right to be effectively exercised. The subscription rights are considered evidence of subscription rights. Once the subscription rights have been exercised  these are to be transferred by the custodian banks to the Settlement Agent's account 1107 at Clearstream Banking AG  Frankfurt am Main  by no later than the end of the Subscription Period on 11 July 2023. No grace period will be granted. No subscription rights trading Neither the Company nor the Settlement Agent organise stock exchange trading of the subscription rights (ISIN DE000A35JST4/ WKN A35JST)  nor do they broker compensation ofsubscription rights among shareholders. However  the subscription rights can be transferred in accordance with the provisions of German stock corporation law. There is no compensation for unused subscription rights. Subscription rights not exercised expire after the end of the Subscription Period. Payment; commission The Subscription Price is due for payment by no later than 11 July 2023. The issuer and Settlement Agent will not charge any special costs or taxes in relation to the subscription of subscription shares. The custodian bank may charge standard bank fees in relation to the subscription of subscription shares. Shareholders and investors should therefore research these costs. Oversubscription Shareholders can oversubscribe. Each shareholder entitled to subscribe may make a binding offer to acquire further New Shares from the cash capital increase at the fixed Subscription Price per share in addition to the subscription attributable to their old shares in accordance with the Subscription Ratio. There is no entitlement to allocation of the number of shares specified in the context of the oversubscription. Disposal of unsubscribed New Shares/ private placement If shareholders waive their subscription rights or do not exercise their subscription rights in the Rights Offering  the New Shares are to be offered to qualified investors (""Investors"") in Germany or in other jurisdictions outside the United States of America based on Regulation S under Regulation S of the U.S. Securities Act from 1933  as amended  (""Reg S"") for purchase by way of private placement without a prospectus (""Private Placement""). To facilitate the Private Placement  the major shareholder - MBB SE based in Berlin - has already waived the exercise of its subscription rights from 6 183 707 of the shares it holds in the Company. After completion of the Private Placement  Pareto AS will deliver to the Investors existing shares in the Company with dividend entitlement from 1 January 2022  which will be provided by a shareholder by means of a securities loan. Entry in the commercial register and delivery of subscription shares The capital increase is expected to be entered on or around the 20 July 2023. After entering the capital increase  the subscription shares will be credited to a collective securities custody account. The subscription shares subscribed in connection with the Rights Offering are expected to be booked to shareholders' custody accounts from 20 July 2023 onwards.",neutral,0.1,0.89,0.01,negative,0.0,0.04,0.96,True,English,"['Delignit', 'rights', 'par value bearer shares', 'existing Delignit AG shareholders', 'Annual General Meeting', 'normal business hours', 'Clearstream Banking AG', 'Quirin Privatbank AG', 'full dividend entitlement', 'Frankfurt am Main', 'authorised custody accounts', '4 (four) old shares', 'pro rata amount', 'Pareto Securities AS', 'indirect subscription right', 'ex subscription right', 'unsubscribed New Shares', 'Delignit AG Blomberg', '1 (one) New Share', 'one New Share', 'existing subscription right', 'share acquisition agreement', 'unused subscription rights', ""shareholders' subscription exercises"", 'WKN A0MZ4B Notification', 'existing Company shares', 'The Subscription Price', 'shareholders subscription rights', 'existing shares', 'Pareto AS', 'Authorised Capital', 'Frankfurt Branch', 'existing shareholders', 'full multiple', 'share capital', 'WKN A35JST', 'subscription ratio', 'subscription order', '2,048,475 new no', 'rights offering', 'same rights', 'UNITED STATES', 'LEGAL SYSTEM', 'SUCH PUBLICATION', 'Management Board', 'Commercial Register', 'Supervisory Board', 'cash deposits', 'same class', 'custodian banks', 'Payment Date', 'Record Date', 'capital increase', 'settlement agent', 'date payment', 'Subscription Period', 'ISIN DE000A0MZ4B', 'ISIN DE000A35JST', 'same resolution', 'shareholder claims', 'Important information', 'DISTRIBUTION', 'AMERICA', 'AUSTRALIA', 'CANADA', 'JAPAN', '25 August', '21 September', 'approval', '24 August', 'contributions', 'kind', 'authorisation', '20 June', 'EUR', 'effect', '1 January', 'option', 'obligation', 'basis', 'Graefstrasse', 'Germany', '27 June', '23 June', 'Mergenthalerallee', '65760 Eschborn', 'exclusion', 'participation', '11 July', 'Berlin', 'instructions', 'compensation', 'accordance', 'fractions', 'declaration', 'exercising', 'receipt', 'restrictions', 'time']",2023-06-26,2023-06-27,marketscreener.com

The shares have been held in Russia by a different depositary bank.In the circular  Deutsche attributed the shortfall to a decision by Moscow to allow investors to convert some of the DRs into local stock.

The shares have been held in Russia by a different depositary bank.In the circular  Deutsche attributed the shortfall to a decision by Moscow to allow investors to convert some of the DRs into local stock. The conversion was carried out without the German bank's ""involvement or oversight"" and Deutsche was unable to reconcile the company shares with the depositary receipts.It is the first major bank to formally inform depositary receipt holders that they may not get take ownership of precisely all the shares they are entitled to  two sources advising investors who continue to hold Russian DRs told Reuters.DRs are certificates issued by a bank representing shares in a foreign company traded on a local stock exchange. Swapping DRs for shares in the Russian company is a first step towards an effort to recover their money.Shares affected include those in national airline Aeroflot (AFLT.MM)  construction firm LSR Group (LSRG.MM)  mining and steel firm Mechel (MTLR.MM) and Novolipetsk Steel (NLMK.MM). Mechel declined to comment  while the remaining companies did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comments.Western sanctions and Russian countermeasures have stranded assets held by citizens and companies on both sides of the political divide. Moscow is also demanding a 10% contribution to the federal budget  termed an ""exit tax"" by Washington.The Kremlin has also taken assets under temporary control  seizing the Russian subsidiaries of two European energy firms in April  underscoring a strategy to lessen foreign influence on companies critical of its economic and political interests.A significant number of investors ranging from small hedge funds to big global asset managers still hold depositary receipts  investor sources said.Most investors have marked down Russian assets to zero but some still harbour hopes of recovering value in the future.Irina Tsukerman  president at geopolitical risk consultancy Scarab Rising  said the news should come as no surprise.""Literally everything in Russia has been vulnerable  whether its these DRs  equities  real estate or any other form of financial asset "" she told Reuters.The Central Bank of Russia did not immediately comment on the matter.Russia's National Settlement Depository said the conversion of shares had been carried out in accordance with Russian legislation and that it was not the accounting institution responsible for implementing this mechanism.'COMPLETE CHAOS'Lawyers and other advisers have described the conversion process as ""complete chaos"".""To a certain extent  this resulted in double counting because  without a reconciliation between Russia and foreign banks  an investor could get Russian shares and still hold the DRs at the foreign bank "" said Grigory Marinichev  a partner at law firm Morgan Lewis.Deutsche Bank is now allowing investors to swap DRs for shares as part of its plans to exit all Russia business  one source said.The bank also determined that clients could be in a better position if they could convert their DRs at least partially  this person added.JPMorgan & Chase (JPM.N)  Citigroup (C.N) and BNY Mellon (BK.N) act as depositary banks for most other Russian depositary receipt programs  according to Clearstream.All three banks declined to comment on whether they had also identified shortfalls  but their books remain closed due to the challenges with reconciliation  according to statements on their websites.Deutsche said in its circular that if it was able to reconcile its books at a later date  then it would look to return more shares to their rightful owners.But it cautioned that the net proceeds from sales of shares it was able to return to investors would likely be ""substantially lower"" than the current market price.The bank said it understood Russia's Government Commission for Control over Foreign Investments required that such shares be sold ""at a discount of at least 50% from their appraised market value "" the circular said.Reporting by Sinead Cruise in London and Carolina Mandl in New York;

Cash position significantly strengthened On March 31  2023  MedinCell had € 6.5 million of cash and cash equivalents (compared to € 24.6 million of cash and cash equivalents and € 2.6 million of current and non-currentnon-risky financial assets a year ago). Financial strategy of the Company was adjusted following FDA's Complete Response Letter received by Teva on April 19  2022  which resulted in commercialization of MedinCell's first product approximately one year later than expected. In November 2022  the Company signed a loan agreement for € 40 million with the European Investment Bank (EIB). The two first tranches of the credit facility for a total amount of € 30 million have been drawn in Q4 2022 and Q1 2023  of which around € 23.3 million have been used to repay the existing EIB loan from 2018 as specified in the agreement. Disbursement of the last € 10 million was conditioned to approval by U.S. FDA of UZEDY that occurred on April 28  2023. This last tranche is available immediately. In addition to the new EIB loan  the Company successfully completed a € 23.2 million net capital raise in May 2023 through an offering to French and international investors via a Private Placement and to retail investors in France. Considering these financing operations and anticipated revenues from existing collaboration  MedinCell has the resources to continue its portfolio development. As of March 31  2023  one of the EIB loan covenants had not been met  giving EIB the right to ask for partial or total early repayment of the existing loan. On June 12  2023  the Company obtained a waiver from EIB. The Company points out that  with its current base cash forecast  that does not include potential new partner service or licensing revenue  the covenant may not be met again as of March 31  2024. This is a significant uncertainty on the going concern. To avoid this  the Company continues having 3/5discussions with the EIB. With a positive outcome  the cash visibility of the company's current base cash forecast is estimated until at least Q4 2025.

Over the same period  operating expenses increased from € 32.2 million to € 37.7 million  mainly due to the increase in Research & Development activities. The Company points out that the first revenues directly linked to product sales should be royalties from the commercialization of products developed with Teva  mainly UZEDY. In the meantime  due to the product development cycle and depending on the financial parameters set up in the context of partnerships (which may or may not include certain elements such as invoicing for formulation services  milestone payments  royalties  cost sharing  profit sharing  etc.)  revenues may vary significantly from one year to the next. B- Net cashflow from investing activities The increase of € 1.6 million compared to previous year corresponds to the end of the capitalization contract in Q1 2023 (€2.6 million) partially offset by the acquisition of machinery and fixed instruments  improvements at the Jacou site for € 0.6 million  and the acquisition of intangible assets for € 0.5 million related to intellectual property. C- Net cashflow from financing activities The net cashflow from financing activities is driven by the new contract with the EIB signed in November 2022  of which € 30 million have been withdrawn as of March 31  2023. This cash has been partly used to early repay the 2018 EIB loan in January 2023 of € 23.3 million. Profit and loss account Income from ordinary activities: € 13.7 million For the year ended March 31  2023  revenues correspond to: Development services of € 5.8 million  mainly related to activities for mdc-WWM and mdc-STM products financed by international health foundations and agencies  compared to €4.0 million in the previous year. The development of a long-acting injectable malaria product supported by the Unitaid health agency generated revenue of € 2.2 million compared to € 1.3 million in the prior year.long-acting injectable malaria product supported by the Unitaid health agency generated revenue of € 2.2 million compared to € 1.3 million in the prior year. The development of a long-acting contraceptive product supported by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation generated revenue of € 2.0 million compared to € 2.4 million in the prior yearlong-acting contraceptive product supported by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation generated revenue of € 2.0 million compared to € 2.4 million in the prior year Reflecting the intensification of Business Development  R&D activities related to new partnered programs(proof of feasibility) generated € 1.6 million revenue compared to €0.3 million in the prior year. In addition  the Company received a milestone payment from Teva of € 2.9 million after their decision in August 2022 to start Phase 3 clinical activities for mdc-TJK  the second schizophrenia product candidate. The Company also received a € 1.2 million royalty payment from the joint venture  CM Biomaterials  dedicated to the sale of polymers to the Company's partners  significantly higher than the € 0.1 million the year before. The Research Tax Credit recognized during the period amounted to € 3.7 million (€ 4.2 million in the prior year).

Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing ""diuretic-resistant"" patient population.alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  delivering major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients and reducing costs for healthcare systems.

The sale price of the building amounts to approximately 12 million EUR. This amount is higher than the latest fair value (as at 31.03.2023)  as determined by Cofinimmo Offices' independent real estate valuer  echoing the potential redevelopment of the site in a sought-after neighbourhood.The building dates back to 1986 and has been the company's Belgian head office since 2001. It has a surface area of approximately 3 900 m² and will give way to a residential building for which the necessary permit applications have already been submitted as at December 2021. These permits  enforceable and cleared of all appeals  have since been obtained in February. This sale and conversion marks a new stage in the transformation of Boulevard de la Woluwe/Woluwedal  a major axis in Brussels  into a mixed-use zone. A transformation that Cofinimmo initiated several years ago.As a result  Cofinimmo's head office should move in the second quarter of 2024 to The Gradient building (Avenue de Tervueren/Tervurenlaan 270). The move  to a building that is already part of Cofinimmo's portfolio and that underwent a major renovation in 2013  was announced to Cofinimmo teams in December 2022.The cumulative amount of divestments already carried out since 01.01.2023 and those already signed and expected to be closed by the end of the financial year now exceeds 190 million EUR.Jean-PierreHanin  CEO of Cofinimmo: ""This transaction is the culmination of a project that began a few years ago to relocate. It enables us to pursue our ESG strategy and the overall rebalancing of our portfolio and demonstrate our ability to perform asset arbitrages. We are pleased to have been able to complete a number of selective arbitrages in recent months in the particular context we are experiencing.

This new European patent provides intellectual property protection for masitinib in the treatment of mCRPC until 2042.Masitinib is positioned in combination with docetaxel as a treatment of mCRPC patients who are eligible to chemotherapy; that is to say  it is administered directly following the metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) treatment space.Although there are numerous treatments in the mHSPC treatment space  there is currently no drug registered for use in combination with docetaxel in patients with mCRPC  despite docetaxel having been approved almost 20 years ago. Historically  there has been a high failure rate of trials studying combinations of docetaxel and new targeted agents  with study AB12003 being a rare example of a phase 3 clinical trial that showed improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) for masitinib in combination with docetaxel.The Notice of Allowance (NOA) means that the European Patent Office intends to grant the patent application  EP4175639A1  after the completion of certain formal procedural steps. Once granted  the patent can be kept in force until May 2042. A European NOA is issued after an examiner determines that a patent application satisfies all requirements for patentability under the European Patent Convention.More specifically  this patent provides protection of masitinib and related compounds for treatment of mCRPC in a patient subpopulation with low metastatic involvement (as measured by baseline alkaline phosphatase levels). This patient population is fully consistent with results from masitinib study AB12003 [1] and the on-going clinical development program of masitinib in mCRPC.As a reminder  key results from study AB12003 include:Masitinib (6.0 mg/kg/day) plus docetaxel conferred a significant progression-free survival (PFS) benefit in mCRPC patients with baseline alkaline phosphatase levels (ALP) less than or equal to 250 IU/L; hazard ratio of 0.79 [0.64 0.97] (p=0.0087)  corresponding to a 21% reduction in risk of progression relative to control.Assessment of PFS rates was convergent with this primary outcome  with 12  18  and 24-month PFS rates showing significant improvement in favor of masitinib plus docetaxel relative to control: 1.6-fold (p=0.0035)  1.9-fold (p=0.0001) and 1.9-fold (p=0.0028)  respectively.A progressively greater masitinib treatment effect was observed for lower baseline ALP levels (i.e.  less advanced metastatic disease)  with a significant 47% reduced risk of progression in patients with ALP less than or equal to 100 IU/L (hazard ratio=0.53  p=0.002).The masitinib plus docetaxel safety profile was acceptable  consistent with the known masitinib profile and with no new safety signals observed.Although localized disease is associated with high survival rates  metastatic prostate cancer still represents an unmet medical need with a 5-years survival rate of about 32% [2].Reference s[1] Pavic  Michel; Hermine  Olivier; Spaeth  Dominique LBA02-11 Masitinib plus docetaxel as first-line treatment of metastatic castrate refractory prostate cancer: results from study AB12003  Journal of Urology: September 2021 - Volume 206 - Issue Supplement 3. doi: 10.1097/JU.0000000000002149.11[2] American Cancer Society.

Eligible patients were chemo-naïve with confirmed mCRCP  who had progressed on previous abiraterone treatment or were indicated for docetaxel treatment  and had a ECOG ≤1. Primary analysis was performed on a pre-specified targeted subgroup  defined as patients with baseline alkaline phosphatase levels (ALP) ≤250 IU/L  and on the overall population. Primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS) (PCWG2 definition). The study was successful if improvement in median PFS relative to control reached a 3.9% level of significance for the target subgroup (alpha split with fallback procedure to conserve overall type-I error at 5% for the overall study cohort). Primary analysis was based on 450 patients in the targeted subgroup (ALP ≤ 250 IU/L). There was a total of 712 patients in the overall study cohort.About masitinibMasitinib is a orally administered tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets mast cells and macrophages  important cells for immunity  through inhibiting a limited number of kinases. Based on its unique mechanism of action  masitinib can be developed in a large number of conditions in oncology  in inflammatory diseases  and in certain diseases of the central nervous system. In oncology due to its immunotherapy effect  masitinib can have an effect on survival  alone or in combination with chemotherapy. Through its activity on mast cells and microglia and consequently the inhibition of the activation of the inflammatory process  masitinib can have an effect on the symptoms associated with some inflammatory and central nervous system diseases and the degeneration of these diseases.About AB ScienceFounded in 2001  AB Science is a pharmaceutical company specializing in the research  development and commercialization of protein kinase inhibitors (PKIs)  a class of targeted proteins whose action are key in signaling pathways within cells. Our programs target only diseases with high unmet medical needs  often lethal with short term survival or rare or refractory to previous line of treatment.AB Science has developed a proprietary portfolio of molecules and the Company’s lead compound  masitinib  has already been registered for veterinary medicine and is developed in human medicine in oncology  neurological diseases  inflammatory diseases and viral diseases. The company is headquartered in Paris  France  and listed on Euronext Paris (ticker: AB).Further information is available on AB Science’s website: www.ab-science.com.Forward-looking Statements - AB ScienceThis press release contains forward-looking statements.

(""Colmar""). Colmar is active since 1963 and in the Arquà Polesine and Costa di Rovigo plants it designs and manufactures machines for railway maintenance and construction.Gilberto Salciccia  Executive Chairman of Salcef Group  commented:""We believe that today's acquisition has a strong strategic rationale for the Group  not only because it is a further step in our external growth path but also as it is the first one in the railway machines segment  where the Group already operates through its subsidiary SRT. The integration of the newly acquired company will allow us to expand the product range of the Railway Machines business unit  both for internal use and for the third-party market  as well as to leverage the commercial synergies arising from Colmar's extensive international network with offices in the United Kingdom  United States  Russia  China  and Colombia"".Lorenzo Peroni  Chief Executive Officer of SRT and head of Railway Machines business unit  commented:""The machines produced and offered by Colmar  which are appreciated and certified by many railway operators worldwide  mainly include road/rail loaders  wheeled and tracked  and electric or diesel-powered shunters. Therefore  they are perfectly complementary to SRT's current product range  which focuses on railway wagon outfittings and rail grinders. Thanks to the Group's expertise in the sector  along with the possibility of receiving feedback directly from our worksites  we will have the opportunity to refine and optimize Colmar's products as well  benefitting both the Group and external customers"".Colmar counts on approximately 110 people and a backlog in excess of 40 million euros. The yearly turnover at regime after the acquisition is expected to be at around 20 million euros  with profitability expected in line with Group average.With an Enterprise Value of approximately 25 million euros  2 million euros have been paid at the signing of the preliminary agreement. The remaining portion of the payment will occur at the closing  expected to take place within the next month of August.The Salcef Group has been operating for over 70 years in the development and innovation of sustainable mobility infrastructures.

The companies will work together to increase near-term production of 225Ac1 to support ongoing clinical trials and to ensure the large-scale supply of the radioisotope in the long term  addressing growing global demand.This collaboration will not have any immediate financial impact but has the potential to bring substantial revenues in the future to PanTera and  indirectly  to its two shareholders SCK CEN and IBA  a listed company on the Brussels stock exchange.Under this collaboration  both companies will use TerraPower Isotope’s natural decay method based on thorium-229 (229Th) and PanTera’s “Gamma route” based on the Rhodotron® and radium-226 to produce 225Ac.225Ac is a promising alpha emitter for use in Targeted Alpha Therapy (TAT). A series of molecules that are currently under research  combined with 225Ac through further manufacturing  have the potential to treat a variety of cancers  targeting solid tumors  metastases  and systemic cancers such as leukemia. There are several clinical studies currently in progress  ranging from preclinical development through to phase 3 clinical trials. Whilst there is high demand  there is a scarcity of 225Ac. The collaboration between PanTera and TerraPower Isotopes is seeking to address this supply issue and support the clinical development of 225Ac based drugs as a potential treatment option for cancer.“We are excited to join forces with TerraPower Isotopes to increase the market availability of 225Ac. While continuing to prepare our unique technology for large-scale production of 225Ac  as from 2024 we will also offer the radioisotope to drug developers for their research and clinical trials  as well as to physicians for compassionate use. This volume would be equivalent to 50% of today’s supply and would underpin the wider development of these targeted alpha therapy radiopharmaceuticals as an effective treatment modality for cancer”  commented Sven Van den Berghe  PanTera’s Chief Executive Officer.Scott Claunch  President of TerraPower Isotopes  added: “Consistent with TerraPower’s vision of developing innovative solutions to help fight disease using nuclear science  TerraPower Isotopes is thrilled to secure this collaboration with PanTera. Demand for 225Ac is expected to increase as more radiopharmaceutical treatments using 225Ac are developed to treat a variety of different types of cancers. This collaboration will help us supply this valuable material to the pharmaceutical industry and meet the growing global demand.”***About PanTeraPanTera  an IBA and SCK CEN joint-venture  aims to secure the large-scale production of actinium-225 (225Ac)  one of the most promising alpha-emitting radioisotopes to fight cancers by Targeted RadioTherapy (TRT). By working towards this large-scale production  PanTera’s ultimate goal is to improve the accessibility of future innovative cancer therapy based on 225Ac and theranostics in general.

Duisburger Verkehrs- und Versorgungsgesellschaft (DVV)  Wirtschaftsbetriebe Duisburg (WBD) and Duisburg Gateway Terminal (DGT) would use the hydrogen directly for local use. To this end  all partners involved have signed a declaration of intent.In order to support the local economy in its transition to climate-neutral energy sources and to decarbonize mobility solutions  the project partners are working closely together and are also acting as future purchasers of the 100 percent green hydrogen. DVV intends to use the sustainable energy source for its hydrogen buses  WBD for its hydrogen-powered refuse collection vehicles and duisport for its internal logistics and the operation of the DGT.Lhyfe will first conduct the feasibility study. The hydrogen production plant with a capacity of up to 20 megawatts  which could be built on a plot of land owned by Duisburger Hafen AG  could go into operation by mid-2025.""The construction of the first large-scale electrolyser in the Port of Duisburg would be a milestone on the way to decarbonising the domestic economy and industry "" says duisport CEO Markus Bangen. ""At the same time  we are fulfilling our promise not only to build the largest container terminal in the European hinterland with the Duisburg Gateway Terminal  but also to operate it in a completely climate-neutral manner.""""Our project planning always takes place in a very close exchange with the parties involved. This type of hydrogen development creates individual and tailor-made projects  from whose expertise we can successfully show other customers a way out of fossil energies "" says Luc Graré  Head of Central & Eastern Europe at Lhyfe GmbH. ""Lhyfe expects this feasibility study to show how the conversion to green hydrogen could already be implemented today on an appropriate scale.""To ensure the production of green hydrogen  the electrolysis plant would be fed exclusively with renewable energies. If the project is implemented  up to eight tonnes of green hydrogen could be produced every day and made available to the partners as needed.""Hydrogen is a central building block of the energy transition. As a group  we are therefore involved in all the decisive stages to make green hydrogen usable here on site "" says Marcus Vunic  Managing Director of DVV. This is because an electrolyzer requires appropriate quantities of electricity and water as well as a sufficiently dimensioned grid connection  explains Vunic: ""Netze Duisburg could be providing the necessary infrastructure with a grid extension  Stadtwerke Duisburg  as a leading regional energy supplier  is securing the required green electricity via a supply agreement  and at the same time we are using the hydrogen for our fuel cell bus fleet in public transport with DVG.""""The project perfectly supports Wirtschaftsbetriebe Duisburg's corporate strategy of successively converting its entire vehicle fleet to alternative drives. With the electrolysis plant being built in the Port of Duisburg  Wirtschaftsbetriebe Duisburg will be able to make short work of filling its hydrogen-powered vehicles with green hydrogen. It is an excellent example of how acting in partnership works in Duisburg. Good for our customers and a further contribution to climate protection "" says Thomas Patermann  spokesman for the WBD Executive Board  who is also convinced by the initiative.In order to be able to optimally supply the hydrogen vehicles with the green hydrogen  the parties involved will be making use of the existing infrastructure and refueling facilities. Lhyfe serves DVV and WBD as a reliable expert for the conversion of their fleet. Through various hydrogen projects already active in the mobility sector  Lhyfe has been able to support various companies and transport operators in the conversion to green hydrogen.""Local generation for local consumption: we are creating an ideal solution here for the Duisburg location and Duisburg companies. Together we will make every effort to ensure that after a positive feasibility study the plant can go into operation as quickly as possible and that all partners involved are supplied with locally produced green hydrogen "" says Alexander Garbar  Head of Corporate Development and Strategy at duisport.For an interview with the spokespersons above  please contact the press department.Click to access the Lhyfe Media Kit (press kit and visuals)Lhyfe is a European group devoted to energy transition  and a producer and supplier of green and renewable hydrogen.

These forward-looking statements are based on current plans  estimates and beliefs of management. All statements  other than statements of historical facts  are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements  including estimates of revenues  operating margins  capital expenditures  cash  other financial information  expected legal  arbitration  political  regulatory or clinical results or practices and other such estimates and results. By their nature  such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and assumptions which might cause the actual results  financial condition  performance or achievements of UCB  or industry results  to differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Important factors that could result in such differences include: the global spread and impact of COVID-19  changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  will progress to product approval or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products  which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB's efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover  sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment  including pricing pressure  political and public scrutiny  customer and prescriber patterns or practices  and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes. Finally  a breakdown  cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality  integrity and availability of UCB's data and systems.Given these uncertainties  you should not place undue reliance on any of such forward-looking statements.

These forward-looking statements are based on current plans  estimates and beliefs of management. All statements  other than statements of historical facts  are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements  including estimates of revenues  operating margins  capital expenditures  cash  other financial information  expected legal  arbitration  political  regulatory or clinical results or practices and other such estimates and results. By their nature  such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and assumptions which might cause the actual results  financial condition  performance or achievements of UCB  or industry results  to differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Important factors that could result in such differences include: changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  will progress to product approval or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products  which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB's efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover  sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment  including pricing pressure  political and public scrutiny  customer and prescriber patterns or practices  and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes. Finally  a breakdown  cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality  integrity and availability of UCB's data and systems.Given these uncertainties  you should not place undue reliance on any of such forward-looking statements.

26782,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/SES-IMAGOTAG-5151/news/Ses-imagotag-SES-imagotag-Response-to-the-Gotham-City-Report-44184672/,Ses-imagotag :  SES-imagotag: Response to the Gotham City Report,(marketscreener.com)  SES-imagotag: Response to the Gotham City ReportSES-imagotag refutes in the strongest possible terms each of the allegations made against it in the report produced by Gotham City Research on Thursday  June 22  2023  under the title “S…,"SES-imagotag: Response to the Gotham City ReportSES-imagotag refutes in the strongest possible terms each of the allegations made against it in the report produced by Gotham City Research on Thursday  June 22  2023  under the title “SES-imagotag: The Circular Dance with a Chinese Twirl.”The present document provides factual  precise  and verifiable answers which shed light on the errors contained in the report. The fraud that is alluded to in the report does not exist; there is no double counting of circular revenues with BOE; the consolidation of the Group's subsidiaries and parent company's revenues is consistent with the consolidated revenue  which is generated exclusively by sales to external customers. The capitalization of SES-imagotag's R&D investments is compliant with IFRS accounting standards. Consequently  there is no over-statement of the company's revenue or profit.SES-imagotag faces this new chapter calmly  true to its approach which emphasizes transparency and respect for rules and standards. But the company is also conscious of the gravity of the consequences of such a maneuver for the entirety of its ecosystem: employees  customers  partners  and shareholders. That is why SES-imagotag reserves the possibility to exercise all rights for future legal action if need be.SES-imagotag is a fast-growing  innovative company  and the world leader of a sector which is developing rapidly. 2023 represents a new year of growth and improving profitability.Hereunder  the Group presents the following clarifications and denials set out in this document which address in detail the topics listed below:The consolidation of the revenues of the subsidiaries and the parent company (forgotten in the Gotham City report)  which is an operating company   net of intercompany flows  is equal to the consolidated Group revenue. Sales of components to BOE are neutralized in consolidation and do not enter into the revenues of the Group. Therefore  there is no round-trip double-counting between SES-imagotag and BOE. The Group revenue is only generated with external customers. The consolidation of the subsidiary in China (the “JV”)  which was majority-owned and controlled by the Group until September 2022  is compliant with IFRS accounting standards. Capitalized expenses are consistent with R&D and IP investments and compliant with IFRS accounting standards. Financial statements are not misstated. Revenue and EBITDA are not overstated. The relationship with BOE is performed at arm's length basis and subject to strict governance and supervision rules. SES-imagotag follows a strict multi-sourcing policy. Purchase prices from BOE have not evolved differently than from other EMS. SES-imagotag does never present itself as a « SaaS company » but as the leading Retail IoT platform  with a large majority (85%) of its revenues coming from ESL hardware  and 15% of its revenues comes from “Software  services and non-ESL solutions (VAS)”. Walmart contract is profitable and consistent with the Vusion'27 strategic plan.1. The consolidation of the revenues of the subsidiaries and the parent company (forgotten in the Gotham City report)  which is an operating company  net of intercompany flows  is equal to the consolidated Group revenue.Gotham City claims the following (p. 7): “SESL's consolidated revenue does not reconcile to the sum of its subsidiaries' revenue”SES-imagotag's consolidated revenue includes the contribution from all the companies it controls. This is the case for the company's subsidiaries for which the statutory revenue is disclosed in Note 24 of the financial statements published in the 2022 Universal Registration Document.The total revenue derived from the standalone financial statements of the company's subsidiaries in the scope of consolidation as at December 31  2022 amounts to €501m. However  this amount does not constitute SES-imagotag's consolidated revenue because it does not include the revenue generated by SES-imagotag as an operating company  a crucial fact that Gotham City omitted to take into account in its assumptions. When the revenue from SES-imagotag as an operating company and the revenue for the first nine months of 2022 from the Chinese JV are taken into account  and after elimination of inter-company accounts  the Group's consolidated net revenue totals €620.9m for FY 2022  as reported. This revenue is generated in its entirety by sales to external clients.This specific control is clearly part of the procedures carried out by the Group's external auditors  as part of their audit of the consolidated financial statements.2. Sales of components to BOE are neutralized in consolidation and do not enter into the revenues of the Group. Therefore  there is no round-trip double-counting between SES-imagotag and BOE.Gotham City claims the following (p. 4  p.7  p. 6): "" 2020-2022 revenues are overstated by at least 7%-13% and 2022 / EBITDA is overstated by 106%” “At least 7%-13% of 2020-2022 SESL revenue are of suspect quality as they to seem to include round-trip transactions and sham revenue from its China JV (that are unrelated to ESL revenue).” “Without these sources of revenue  SESL would have missed 2021 & 2022 revenue guidance.” “2019-2022 revenues are overstated by at least 7%-13%  which means most – if not all – of EBITDA is overstated as well.”The transactions between BOE and SES-imagotag are related-parties transactions and are reported in our Annual Reports / Universal Registration Documents available on the website of the company.Starting in 2021  SES-imagotag has purchased strategic components from Eink  in order to control their sourcing. SES-imagotag has then resold these strategic components to the ESL assembly factory of BOE  who assembles and sells the finished ESLs to SES-imagotag.In order to indeed avoid double counting of related revenues and the costs  the initial purchase from Eink and sale to BOE of components are neutralized in the Group consolidated financial statements. There is consequently no double counting or round-trip transactions in the Group consolidated financial statements. This is part of the procedures carried out by the Group's external auditors  as part of their audit of the consolidated financial statements.The Group revenue is therefore only generated with external customers.There is no double counting related to round trip revenues in the Group consolidated financial statements  and therefore the Group consolidated Revenues and the Group consolidated EBITDA are not overstated.Note: In 2018 the China JV did not exist and BOE was acting as a reseller of SES-imagotag products to kick-off sales in China. In 2018  SES-imagotag sold products and services to BOE to launch such activities. In 2019  the JV was incorporated and BOE stopped acting as the Group reseller in China.Therefore  such transactions between SES-imagotag and BOE stopped.3. The consolidation of the subsidiary in China (the “JV”)  which was majority-owned and controlled by the Group until September 2022  is compliant with IFRS accounting standards.Gotham City claims the following (p.11): “Despite owning 51% of the JV  SESL consolidates 100% of its financials onto its own consolidated financial statements. Whether this accounting treatment is permissible or not  we believe it is non-obvious and very misleading to investors. SESL would've missed revenue guidance in both 2021 and 2022 (EUR 400 million and 600 million revenue guidance in 2021 and 2022  respectively) were the company to have elected the more conservative equity method to account for the JV”The contribution of BOE Digital Technology Co Ltd (the “JV”) to SES-imagotag Group consolidated revenues was €19m in 2022 and not €31m as stated by Gotham City.Regarding the consolidation method  it is reminded that SES-imagotag owned 51% of this entity and controlled its Board of Directors. It was therefore an obligation as per the IFRS accounting standards to consolidate in full integration the financial statements of this company. Under these rules  it was not possible for SES-imagotag to “have elected the more conservative equity method to account for the JV”. SES-imagotag fully consolidated the JV's P&L and the balance sheet in its consolidated financial statements as it was required to do as per the IFRS accounting standards.Consequently  SES-imagotag had to fully consolidate the revenues of this entity and would not have missed its revenue guidance even if the company had been consolidated under a different – but not allowed – accounting method. Since Q4 2022 this entity is not anymore consolidated  but the Group continues to grow fast with an unchanged target of €800m in 2023.Gotham City claims the following (p.13  p.16): “ESL revenue doesn't seem to account for the JV's 2019-2022 revenue  and SESL doesn't explain what they are. Worse  SESL adds to the confusion by including the JV's revenue as “rest of the world” revenue  as if the JV's revenue were ESL revenue” “The JV's 2019 revenues may exist  but mostly come from the sale of non-ESL digital signage” “Concern that « The JV's revenue comes from unexplained  possibly suspect sources  akin to roundtrip revenue between it and BOE »”As in all other countries where the Group is active  the range of products includes Electronic Shelf Labels as well as other products and services including digital signage solutions. This last is a specialty of BOE and constitutes one of the synergies between the two groups.Low ESL market prices and margins in China led the company to slow down efforts on ESL  and to focus more on digital signage. However  the subsidiary profitability still remained very low and the COVID pandemic made it more difficult to operate the subsidiary. The investment required to reach a critical scale led to the conclusion that SES-imagotag had better capital allocation priorities (notably in America). As a result  it was decided to sell the subsidiary to a partner with the right local scale and expertise.Gotham City claims the following (p.12): “SESL divested its entire 51% JV stake in Q3 2022 for EUR 13.8 million – the same amount it paid for it in 2019. We find this is a suspiciously low price  given the JV's revenue grew ~ 8x since SESL first purchased the stake. This low valuation implies to us that the JV failed to grow ESL revenue” As stated on page 197 of the 2022 Universal Registration document  “On July 22  2022  the company's Board of Directors approved the transfer of the 51% share that the Group held in its joint venture in China in exchange for 8.9% of BOE-YiYun  a Chinese tech sector company”.The 51% stake in the JV was sold against a 8.9% stake in the company YiYun Technologies and SES-imagotag incurred no cash settlement for this transaction.The only cash impact in the Group's financial statements stemming from this transaction is a consolidation change in scope impact. When the Group stopped consolidating the China JV  it also stopped consolidating the cash position of the JV resulting in a negative impact on the overall cash position of the Group of €13.8m (the cash position at the time of the divestment).As in all in-kind transactions  an external fairness opinion performed by an independent expert confirmed the valuations of both YiYun and BOE Digital Technology Co Ltd for this transaction. And according to our governance rules regarding related parties transactions  the BOE board members abstained from all votes regarding this transaction.4. Capitalized expenses are consistent with R&D and IP investments and compliant with IFRS accounting standards.Gotham City claims the following (p.5  p.18): “106% of SESL EBITDA 2022 is of doubtful quality after accounting for suspect 2022 revenue and the capitalization of what appears to be standard operating expenses.” “Over 5 years  SESL's capitalized expenses have been 2x that of Pricer's as a % of revenue. SESL consistently capitalizes far more than Pricer  even though they are in the same business. We believe this excess difference is improperly capitalized and should be treated as operating expenses (FYI  if we were to apply US GAAP standards instead of IFRS  SESL's cost capitalizations would look even more improper).”SES-imagotag's strong growth and leadership positions are fueled by all the innovations it has brought to the industry. In the past few years  SES-imagotag has triggered some major innovation projects  including Vusion Cloud  Vusion OS  Captana  and Pulse as examples. And some of those key innovations  which required sizeable investments  have led to the partnership recently announced with Walmart US.To this end  each year we submit many patent applications and we have built an IP portfolio that is unmatched among our peers.SES-imagotag employs large R&D teams (see above) to develop these products and capitalizes part of the time they spend on these development projects  in compliance with IFRS accounting standards.The Group uses time sheets populated by R&D teams and controlled by its Finance Department. Only the portion of their time dedicated to viable and revenue generating products and solutions is capitalized. The remaining part of their time is expensed.A dedicated audit procedure is carried out by auditors on this accounting treatment  as part of their audit of the consolidated financial statements.This accounting method complies with IFRS accounting standards and has been applied for many years by the Group.SES-imagotag invests far more than its peers in innovation which provides a foundation of its leadership  fast growth  VAS growth and profitability improvement.5. Financial statements are not misstated. Revenue and EBITDA are not overstated.In summary of the above answers 1) to 4)  it is confirmed that:The consolidation of the revenues of the subsidiaries and the parent company (forgotten in the Gotham City report)  which is an operating company   net of intercompany flows  is equal to the consolidated Group revenue.  net of intercompany flows  is equal to the consolidated Group revenue. Sales of components to BOE are neutralized in consolidation and do not enter into the revenues of the Group. Therefore  there is no round-trip double-counting between SES-imagotag and BOE. The Group revenue is only generated with external customers.Therefore  there is no round-trip double-counting between SES-imagotag and BOE. The Group revenue is only generated with external customers. The consolidation of the subsidiary in China (the “JV”)  which was majority-owned and controlled by the Group until September 2022  is compliant with IFRS accounting standards.Capitalized expenses are consistent with R&D and IP investments and compliant with IFRS accounting standards.Therefore  none of the allegations are valid  Revenue and EBITDA are not overstated and the financial statements are not misstated.Regarding Free Cash FlowSES-imagotag has consistently reported on its Free Cash Flow generation every semester.This Free Cash Flow is totally transparent. It includes  in particular  the generation of cash from the net income / loss but also the high investments in innovation (mentioned above) and the working capital requirements resulting from the strong growth spurred by our innovations and our international expansion. Any comparison to our peers (e.g. like Pricer in the Gotham City report) should factor in growth (working capital impact) and innovation (Capex impact).6. The relationship with BOE is subject to strict governance and supervision rulesThe report casts suspicion on the governance of the company and the management of supposed conflicts of interest with BOE.As a reminder  the contracts for which BOE is a supplier are always the result of a formal request for proposal  are submitted to French rules on approval of related-party agreements (and therefore approved by the shareholders' general meeting on an annual basis)  and are subject to voting at the Board of Directors level without the participation of non-executive directors who represent BOE.Since 2018  the majority of the members of the Audit committee and of the ESG/Nominations/Remune-ration committee are independent directors who are European or American  who all have backgrounds that include broad experience at the senior executive level of world-renowned companies  and whose skills and reputations are well-known  especially in matters regarding corporate governance.7. SES-imagotag follows a strict multi-sourcing policy. Purchase prices from BOE have not evolved differently than from other EMS.Regarding our relationship with BOE as a supplier:Gross errors on all the COGS estimations and interpretations in the Gotham City reportGotham City claims the following (p.20): “We estimate that soon after BOE became SESL's largest supplier in 2019  SESL's average cost per label produced declined through 2021  improving SESL's margins” “SESL's per unit costs started rising just as BOE and its interests began diverging in 2022”SES-imagotag's ESL product range includes many sizes ranging from 1.5i to 12inch  with prices that vary by a factor or more than 1 to 10. Therefore  any assumptions based on average COGS ignores the important of the mix of products which is essential.The other element with major importance when analyzing COGS evolution is the evolution of €/$.Another major factor in the recent years is the COVID related components shortage and price surge.The conclusions of the report on COGS are therefore totally wrong.Purchase prices from BOE have not evolved differently from that of other EMS and have followed the industry dynamics during both Covid and post-Covid periods. As a matter of fact  they stopped increasing over the course of 2022.Negotiations on arm's length basisThe Group strategy is and has always been a multi-sourcing strategy for all suppliers  including EMS. It is all the more important given the fast growth in North America and the need to build a supply chain in the region. Historical examples of this supply chain flexibility also include the group's establishment of a supply chain in Vietnam.The Group also has a long-standing commitment and policy towards issuing RFP's. If BOE responds to one of the company's RFP's  it goes without saying that this is a competitive bid including alternative EMS.Purchasing terms and prices are not dictated by our EMS partners. SES-imagotag's purchasing teams negotiate terms directly with most key components suppliers that make up the Bill of Materials. What is negotiated with the EMS is their specific assembly value add as well as non-strategic components which consist of a minor part of the total ESL purchasing cost.BOE is managed like any other supplier  and the roles are clearly separate with its role of shareholder as it is explained in section 6 above.8. SES-imagotag does never present itself as « SaaS company » but as the leading Retail IoT platform  with a large majority (85%) of its revenues coming from ESL hardware  and 15% of our revenues come from “Software  services and non-ESL solutions (VAS)”.The Gotham City report confuses SAAS and VAS to suggest that the Group's communications are misleading.SES-imagotag has never presented itself as a « SAAS company » but as the leading Retail IoT platform  with a large majority (85%) of its revenues coming from ESL hardware.15% of the Group's revenues come from « Software  services and non-ESL solutions (VAS) ». VAS is the acronym for Value Added Solutions & Services. VAS revenues include: Vusion Software licenses and SAAS platform (see cloud metrics below)  maintenance contracts  professional services (installations  set-up fees  project management  engineering services for custom solutions  …)  Captana revenues from cameras  sensors and SAAS  Pulse and Memory Data analytics SAAS platform  Engage solution (Video-rail  digital signage and V-Ads SAAS platform)  Industrial IoT solutions (PDI).Today  SAAS revenues are still a minor fraction of the total VAS revenue  the largest part is still consisting of the other products and services. This will evolve with the rapidly increasing penetration of the cloud in the Group's stores installed base. The Group's SAAS capability and large scope of VAS solutions are recognized as one of its major differentiation and competitive advantage.VAS revenues in 2022 amounted to €93m i.e.  15% of revenues as reported in our 2022 Universal Registration Document (page 177)  compared to 85% for ESL. It is very clear in the Group's communication that VAS is all revenues except ESLs. The Group shows the distinction between VAS and ESL because VAS  as a whole  represents a more profitable and more recurring set of solutions.Note: The Group does not disclose the detailed breakdown of the VAS revenues by product for confidentiality reasons vs. our competitors  as it is a very distinctive aspect of the Group's strategy  and before all these product lines to reach a critical size.Cloud key metricsGotham City claims the following (p.31  p.35): “Limited real-world footprint” … “Limited Web traffic for their cloud URLs”… “ 6 out of the 7 written reviews on the Google Play Store complain that the VSION Link app doesn't work”As of December 31  2022 and as reported in our 2022 Universal registration document (URD) on page 152  SES-imagotag manages more than 50 million electronic shelf labels (50 002 301) in 10 398 stores  increasing respectively by +61% and +48% vs. 2021.The large majority of our new customers join the Group's Cloud/SAAS platform and it is actually the case of all our new customers in the US.The Group's Cloud platform activity is intense and growing fast. As of May 2023  the Group can report the following impressive KPIs regarding the cloud platform activity:61.5 million connected ESLs14 041 connected stores11 636 active API users just in the month of May 2023135 million monthly API calls (May 2023)API calls (May 2023) 423 million monthly IoT updates (May 2023)The flawed statistics mentioned in the report are based on the URL vusion.cloud.io.but this link does not belong to SES-imagotag!For information  VUSION Cloud is accessible to the Group's customers through the following URLs  based on the respective geographies: https://manager-eu.vusion.io for Europe and https://manager-us.vusion.io the AmericasReported customer NPS is high (55 in 2022) but the Group's Cloud customers are showing an even higher NPS score.The VUSION Link app is active in more than 13K devices on Android and in 2.5K active devices on iOS. But more importantly  most of the Group's larger clients use private play stores to distribute our VUSION Link application to a very large number of users – all of which are unaccounted for in the public stores.More generally  the Group's platform is a Business-to-Business solution which operates IoT devices deployed in physical stores. There is therefore no business rationale for free trials  and the comparisons made are totally irrelevant.R&D TeamsGotham City claims the following (p.35): “Despite promoting itself as “the leading retail IoT SaaS solution” We find no mention of software engineers/developers/programmers under their employee ‘categories'”The figures presented are representing the French employee headcount  presented as categories of employees (Managers  Supervisors and technicians  workers  apprentices under contract).On page 119 of the Group's 2022 Universal Registration Document  it is reported over 200 engineers within the Group working in 7 different R&D centers. The vast majority of the teams in the R&D centers in Paris  Cork  Ettenheim  Amiens  are software / cloud / AI focused.Presentation per operating segmentGotham City claims the following (p.41): “SESL seems to be intentionally blurring the perceived segments of its business” (…) “An entity shall report separately information about an operating segment that meets any of the following quantitative thresholds.” (…) So herein lies the deception: “On the one hand  SESL  in its audited financial statements  presents its business as if it consists of only one operating segment” (…) “On the other hand  SESL presents its business as if it consists of two segments  including a SaaS segment they label as VAS  in all its investor materials outside the scope of its auditors”The Gotham City report is mistaken on IFRS 8 standard rules.IFRS 8 defines an operating segment as follows. An operating segment is a component of an entity: [IFRS 8.2]that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses (including revenues and expenses relating to transactions with other components of the same entity)whose operating results are reviewed regularly by the entity's chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance andfor which discrete financial information is available.Since these conditions are not all met regarding VAS  SES-imagotag is currently reporting on only one segment.This topic is a dynamic assessment performed by the management of the Group and part of the procedures carried out by the auditors.Regarding the presentation of our business to the investors  SES-imagotag has never mentioned or presented the VAS as an operating segment. As can be seen on the slides displayed in the report  the only information provided related to VAS is the revenue. Investor presentations are therefore consistent with the audited financial statements.9. Walmart contract is profitable and consistent with the Vusion'27 planGotham City claims the following (p.26): “We believe that WMT has become SESL's largest customer accounting for 34% of SESL's total 2022 revenue as described below (…) If we are correct that Walmart is SESL's largest customer as of 2022  then Walmart has contributed EUR 211 million of 2022 revenues for SES. Based on the Walmart deal's Phase 1 details  we estimate that the deal generates EUR 212 million on an annualized basis”.SES-imagotag's success relies on long-term partnership with its clients and partners. Long-term partnerships are based on reciprocity  meaning that both SES-imagotag and its clients perform all necessary due diligence such as technology  financials  governance  long-term business planning etc. before entering into commercial agreements.In the context of the Walmart US partnership  which is significant because of its potential size  the Group ensures that it performed those due diligence very thoroughly. SES-imagotag would not enter into such agreements without ensuring compliance with its VUSION 27 plan  irrespective of the client.Gotham City is grossly misrepresenting the relationship and the economics of the partnership by making false assumptions. As an example of the shallow analysis work performed by Gotham  Asia and America's revenues for 2022 were reported as €134m in the Group's annual report while Gotham claims €211m for the same period on Walmart alone. Furthermore  the roll-out contract in the U.S. announced on April 27  2023  does not impact the Group's 2022 revenues since “The contract will span several years  with a first phase of 500 locations over the next 12 to 18 months  for a total of 60 million digital shelf labels  with the opportunity to expand further within Walmart's store fleet.”.Gotham City claims the following (p.26): “With the BOE unwind  and SESL' COGS per unit rising  we wonder how much margin SESL can generate. By our calculations  SESL would generate a large loss selling to WMT at EUR 5.30 per ESL  if SESL COGS per ESL remains at 2022 levels of EUR 6.66 per ESL  as shown below”.In addition to the errors on COGS pointed out in section 7  the allegations made by the Gotham City Research are wrong and rely on easily debunked shallow analysis work.First of all  as published on April 27  2023: “Walmart will deploy for the first time ever the latest-generation VUSION platform  which was developed by SES-imagotag labs through an R&D program that has been in progress for more than ten years  with first patents filed as early as 2013.” Gotham City's Report deliberately chose to not take that into consideration  preferring instead to rely on flawed historical data.Second  basing the margin analysis of a specific contract based on historical blended datasets shows a limited understanding of the drivers of this industry. This would be similar to extrapolating the profitability of a specific new Smartphone model by looking at the historical industry average COGS of all Smartphones.While SES-imagotag does not disclose detailed financial information linked to commercial contracts to respect the confidentiality agreements it has with its clients and partners  the Group can reaffirm that the contract signed with Walmart U.S. is consistent with the Vusion '27 strategic plan growth and profitability targets.AppendixGotham City claims the following (p.13): ""SESL's explanations regarding its 2019 and 2020 licensing agreement with the JV are suspect""Adequate IP management with our former subsidiary (BOE Digital Technology Co. Ltd.  the “JV”)On royalties close to zero:In 2019  SES-imagotag SA granted IP rights to our controlled subsidiary BOE Digital Technology Co. Ltd. to manufacture and distribute ESL products on the mainland China territory: the licensing agreement authorizes the JV to order ESL's directly from the Chongqing plant and not through SES-imagotag SA for obvious pragmatic reasons  the two entities sitting in the same territory. This is the rationale behind the licensing contract granting a manufacturing right.Since there was no point in charging this fee at the start-up phase in a Chinese market which was very price competitive  it was decided to not charge the first two years  and then to charge gradually over time an incremental fee (starting at 1%) to move up to the standard Group fee (3%) the following years  leaving time for the Chinese distribution entity to reach break-even. From a tax standpoint  that “license-free period” has to be short and justified by that start-up period  so due to OECD transfer price compliance reasons the licensing fee started to be charged in 2021. The date of signature and effective date are distant as related parties' agreements have to be approved by the mother company board on the one hand and then the JV board.On Cross-licensingThe cross-licensing agreement intends to allow co-innovation between SES-imagotag and BOE Digital Technology Co. Ltd. Specifically  SES-imagotag wants to leverage the local R&D capability to perform cost-down redesigns band innovations  developing new IP on the base of our initial IP. The cross licensing is enabling BOE Digital Technology Co. Ltd to develop their incremental IP (“the improvements”) on the base of SES-imagotag's background IP and allows SES-imagotag to benefit from this incremental IP developed by BOE Digital Technology Co. Ltd. The Parties acknowledge that they will both get an equal benefit from the Cross-License. Therefore  the Parties agree that the Cross-License is made on a royalty-free basis since each Party is duly compensated by the rights granted by the other Party under this Agreement.Gotham City claims the following (p.9): “SESL does not disclose these material related party payables and receivables transactions”.This information is not required. The information required in the annual report is related to the purchases and the sales made with related parties. This information has been properly disclosed.Deferred revenuesGotham City claims the following (p.37): “SESL's Deferred revenue levels and disclosures do not look like a SaaS company's disclosures” “the levels of deferred revenue they report do not resemble those of SaaS companies either”As already stated in this report. SES-imagotag has consistently reported that the vast majority of its revenues consisted of ESL (hardware) revenues. Comparing the totality of the revenues including 85% ESL revenues to deferred revenues and comparing this ratio with that of a pure SaaS company is irrelevant.Branding in ChinaGotham City claims the following (p.23): “In a WeChat post found on the JV's WeChat page  and commenting on the award that the press release discussed  there are pictures showing BOE Vusion ESLs  with no mention of SES Imagotag”In terms of the branding  it has been chosen in 2018 to leverage the strong brand equity of BOE in China  where SES-imagotag was totally unknown.SES-imagotag's combined general shareholders meeting of June 23  2023The shareholders of SES-imagotag gathered on June 23 at the company's headquarters. During the Meeting  the Chairman and CEO of the SES-imagotag group  Thierry Gadou  presented the 2022 highlights of the Group  as well as the outlook for 2023. Thierry Lemaitre  Group CFO  presented the financial results for the 2022 financial year.The auditors also presented their reports  which they prepared for the Meeting  giving unqualified audit reports in respect of the 2022 annual financial statements.Following these presentations  the Combined General Meeting adopted by a large majority all of the resolutions.Answering one of the questions  the management has indicated that SESIM  the company gathering the management and employees of the Company  which currently holds 12% of the share capital  may consider to strengthen its shareholding position at the Company in the coming weeks for an amount ofc. EUR 1 million.About SES-imagotag and the VUSION Retail IoT platformSES-imagotag is a world leader in smart digital labels and IoT solutions for physical retail  serving over 350 large retailer groups around the world in Europe  Asia and North America.SES-imagotag has developed the VUSION Retail IOT technology platform to help retailers transform their physical stores into high value digital assets  more automated  data-driven  and connected in real-time to suppliers and consumers.

People living with gMG often face treatment options that are broad-acting  and that have traditionally only offered symptomatic relief”   explained Professor Vera Bril  Professor of Medicine (Neurology)  University of Toronto  Director of the Neuromuscular Section  Division of Neurology  University of Toronto and University Health Network  Toronto  and lead investigator of the MycarinG study.“There is a significant need for new  innovative treatment options to reduce the day-to-day burden of gMG. Rozanolixizumab-noli is a new treatment option  targeting one of the mechanisms of disease to provide symptom improvement in patient-and physician reported outcomes at day 43.”gMG is a rare  chronic  heterogeneous (phenotypic and pathogenic)  unpredictable autoimmune disease characterized by dysfunction and damage at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ).4 5 6 Several factors are understood to be drivers of gMG disease pathology  including complement-cascade  immune cells and pathogenic IgG autoantibodies. Pathogenic IgG autoantibodies can impair synaptic transmission at the NMJ by targeting specific proteins on the post-synaptic membrane4 7 This disrupts the ability of the nerves to stimulate the muscle and results in a weaker contraction.4 gMG has a global prevalence of 100–350 cases per every 1 million people.5“No two people living with gMG experience the disease in the same way  so we can’t take a ‘one size fits all’ approach to disease management ” said Iris Loew-Friedrich  Executive Vice-President and Chief Medical Officer at UCB. “Disease management should be based on the clinical needs and preferences of the individual patient  and the aim of treatment is to help restore that patient’s ability to carry out activities of daily living. The approval of rozanolixizumab-noli means doctors have an additional approved treatment option for their gMG patients who have not yet found a treatment that meets their needs.”The FDA approval1 is supported by safety and efficacy data from the pivotal Phase 3 MycarinG study (NCT03971422)  published in The Lancet Neurology in May 2023.1 The primary efficacy endpoint was the comparison of the change from baseline between treatment groups in the MG-ADL total score at day 43. MG-ADL is a measurement tool which assesses the impact of gMG on daily functions of 8 signs or symptoms that are typically affected in gMG. These include activities such as breathing  talking  swallowing  and being able to rise from a chair3. Each item is assessed on a 4-point scale where a score of 0 represents normal function and a score of 3 represents loss of ability to perform that function. A total score ranges from 0 to 24  with the higher scores indicating more impairment. A statistically significant difference favoring rozanolixizumab-noli was observed in the MG-ADL total score change from baseline [-3.4 points in rozanolixizumab-noli-treated group at either dose vs -0.8 points in the placebo-treated group (p<0.001)].The secondary endpoint was the change between treatment groups from baseline to day 43 in the QMG. The QMG is a 13-item categorical grading system that assesses muscle weakness. Each item is assessed on a 4-point scale where a score of 0 represents no weakness and a score of 3 represents severe weakness. A total possible score ranges from 0 to 39  where higher scores indicate more severe impairment. A statistically significant difference favoring rozanolixizumab-noli was observed in the QMG total score change from baseline [-5.4 points and -6.7 points in rozanolixizumab-noli-treated group at ≈7mg/kg and ≈10 mg/kg dose level  respectively  vs -1.9 points in the placebo-treated group (p<0.001)].The most common adverse reactions (reported in at least 10% of patients treated with in rozanolixizumab-noli) were headache  infections  diarrhea  pyrexia  hypersensitivity reactions  and nausea.1“We want to thank UCB for their continued commitment to the MG community to bring a new FDA-approved treatment option for generalized myasthenia gravis to patients and their treating physicians ” said Samantha Masterson  President and Chief Executive Officer of the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA). “People living with generalized myasthenia gravis continue to experience significant unmet medical needs  this means expanding the number of FDA-approved treatment options is particularly important to treat this chronic  autoimmune  neuromuscular disease.”Rozanolixizumab-noli will be commercially available in the U.S. during the 3rd quarter of 2023.“Building on our decades of experience in neurology and immunology  we are proud to support the MG community with solutions to help improve patient lives  including a new FDA-approved treatment  education and support”  continued Iris Loew-Friedrich. The approval following priority review of rozanolixizumab-noli is a testament to this medicine’s potential as a generally well-tolerated treatment option that is targeted to the individual needs of patients. We are so grateful to the patients  care partners  and investigators who participated in the MycarinG study  and to our employees and collaborators  whose dedication and commitment to the MG community made this important milestone possible.”The FDA reviewed rozanolixizumab-noli under Priority Review. Rozanolixizumab is also currently under review by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) for the treatment of adults with gMG. In 2019  the U.S. FDA granted orphan drug designation to rozanolixizumab-noli for the treatment of generalized myasthenia gravis.8 Orphan designation was granted by the European Commission in April 2020 to rozanolixizumab for the treatment of generalized myasthenia gravis.9 The PMDA granted similar orphan status to rozanolixizumab in Japan in November.10 Responses from regulatory agencies to these submissions are expected by H1 2024.About Generalized Myasthenia Gravis (gMG)gMG is a rare disease with a global prevalence of 100–350 cases per every 1 million people.5 People living with gMG can experience a variety of symptoms  including severe muscular weakness that can result in life-threatening weakness of the muscles of respiration  double vision  drooping eyelids  and difficulty swallowing  chewing and talking.11 12In gMG  pathogenic autoantibodies can impair synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) by targeting specific proteins on the post-synaptic membrane.3 4 This disrupts the ability of the nerves to stimulate the muscle and results in a weaker contraction. gMG can occur in any race  gender or age.13About the MycarinG study2The MycarinG study (NCT03971422) is a multi-center  Phase 3  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled study evaluating the efficacy and safety of rozanolixizumab in adult patients with gMG  with an open-label extension.The primary endpoint for the MycarinG study is change in the Myasthenia Gravis-Activities of Daily Living Profile (MG-ADL) score  an eight-item patient-reported scale developed to assess MG symptoms and their effects on daily activities. Additional endpoints include response rates  changes in the Myasthenia Gravis composite (MGC) score  the Quantitative MG (QMG) score  patient-reported outcomes at day 43 and adverse events (AEs). The majority of patients taking part in the MycarinG study opted to enroll in any future extensions to this clinical trial. As a result  UCB is exploring the potential for further extension studies into this treatment.For more information about the trial  visit https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/showithNCT03971422.About rozanolixizumabRozanolixizumab is a subcutaneous administered  humanized monoclonal antibody that specifically binds  with high affinity  to human neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). It has been designed to block the interaction of FcRn and Immunoglobulin G (IgG)  accelerating the catabolism of antibodies and reducing the concentration of pathogenic IgG autoantibodies.2Outside of the U.S. rozanolixizumab is not approved for use in any indication by any other regulatory authority worldwide.*In the U.S.  the International Nonproprietary Name (INN) for rozanolixizumab is ‘rozanolixizumab-noli’ following the FDA’s ‘Non-proprietary Naming of Biological Products Guidance’. This guidance advises that the nonproprietary name designated for originator biological products should be a proper name that is a combination of the core name and a distinguishing suffix that is devoid of meaning and composed of four lowercase letters.Important Safety Information for RYSTIGGO®WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSInfections: RYSTIGGO may increase the risk of infection. Delay RYSTIGGO administration in patients with an active infection until the infection is resolved. During treatment with RYSTIGGO  monitor for clinical signs and symptoms of infection. If serious infection occurs  administer appropriate treatment and consider withholding RYSTIGGO until the infection has resolved.ImmunizationImmunization with vaccines during RYSTIGGO treatment has not been studied. The safety of immunization with live or live-attenuated vaccines and the response to immunization with any vaccine are unknown. Because RYSTIGGO causes a reduction in IgG levels  vaccination with live-attenuated or live vaccines is not recommended during treatment with RYSTIGGO. Evaluate the need to administer age-appropriate vaccines according to immunization guidelines before initiation of a new treatment cycle with RYSTIGGO.Aseptic Meningitis: Serious adverse reactions of aseptic meningitis (also called drug-induced aseptic meningitis) have been reported in patients treated with RYSTIGGO. If symptoms consistent with aseptic meningitis develop  diagnostic workup and treatment should be initiated according to the standard of care.Hypersensitivity Reactions: Hypersensitivity reactions  including angioedema and rash  were observed in patients treated with RYSTIGGO. Management of hypersensitivity reactions depends on the type and severity of the reaction. Monitor patients during treatment with RYSTIGGO and for 15 minutes after for clinical signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions. If a reaction occurs  institute appropriate measures if needed.ADVERSE REACTIONSIn a placebo-controlled study  the most common adverse reactions (reported in at least 10% of RYSTIGGO-treated patients) were headache  infections  diarrhea  pyrexia  hypersensitivity reactions  and nausea. Serious infections were reported in 4% of patients treated with RYSTIGGO. Three fatal cases of pneumonia were identified  caused by COVID-19 infection in two patients and an unknown pathogen in one patient. Six cases of infections led to discontinuation of RYSTIGGO.The full Prescribing Information will be available at https://www.ucb-usa.com/RYSTIGGO-prescribing-information.pdfAbout UCBUCB  Brussels  Belgium (www.ucb.com) is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of innovative medicines and solutions to transform the lives of people living with severe diseases of the immune system or of the central nervous system.
