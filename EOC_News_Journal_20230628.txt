Artprice takes this opportunity to review the acceleration of the art market since the beginning of the 21st century  via a quick look at the works that the market values ??the most.Auction turnover (2000-2022) by year of creation in painting[ https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/06/image1-1964-artmarket-com-auction-turnover-by-year-of-creation-in-painting.png ]‚ÄúThe analysis of auctions results is a fascinating way to examine the evolution of Art History ‚Äù  explains thierry Ehrmann  President of Artmarket.com and Founder of Artprice. ‚Äú Our d atabases  have collected objective and comprehensive Fine Art auction data for more than 30 years from all over the world . They therefore provide an extraordinary tool for studying the appetites of collectors and revealing what our contemporaries value the mo st‚Äù.The triumph of Pop ArtIn 1964  Andy Warhol  Roy Lichtenstein  Robert Rauschenberg  and Ed Ruscha were at the peak of their careers and these four artists all have auction price records for works created that year  in the midst of the Cold War  just a few months after the assassination of President J.F. Kennedy. These records  to which must be added more than thirteen thousand other auction results for artworks made that year  make 1964 the year-of-creation that generated the greatest volume of auction turnover in the period 2000 to 2023 (twenty-two years)  all creative periods combined: $2.48 billion.Having fetched the second best art auction result of all time at $195 million on 9 May 2022 at Christie's in New York  Andy Warhol's Shot sage blue Marilyn (1964) is now a sort of figurehead for that year (1964). Although from a market perspective the previous two years were just as important for Warhol  1964 is also remembered in the art world for another reason: in 1964 Robert Rauschenberg won the Grand Prize at the Venice Biennale. Indeed  promoted by Leo Castelli (and perhaps even supported by the CIA)  in 1964 Pop Art imposed itself in the art world thereby consolidating a significant shift of art (and the art market) to the West‚Ä¶ a transfer of power from Paris to New York on the international scene. The way this transfer came about has been the subject of intense discussion.Top 15 auction prices for artworks produced in 1964[ https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/06/image2-1964-artmarket-com-top-15-auction-prices-artworks-produced-in-1964.png ]Abstraction  Pop Art and ExpressionismIn the mid-1960s  several major artists of the first half of the 20th century were still creating important works. Pablo Picasso  Alberto Giacometti  and Ren√© Magritte were still active. In Asia  Li Keran and Fu Baoshi were perpetuating the art of traditional Chinese painting by giving it very personal touches of modernity  while in Europe Zao Wou-Ki and some of his compatriots were exploring Lyrical Abstraction. In England  a new generation was making its mark: David Hockney was 27 in 1964  Frank Auerbach was 33 and Lucien Freud was 42. They were just at the beginning of their careers  but that year Francis Bacon  aged 55  painted some of his best portraits.In the United States  Mark Rothko  Barnett Newman  Willem De Kooning  and Clyfford Still were still exploring Abstract Expressionism and Jackson Pollock had passed away a few year back  while a new artistic revolution was emerging: Pop Art. It was this movement that truly imposed America on the international art scene and the international art market. The works themselves were often brilliant and eye-catching but they also often contained covert or less-covert criticism of the American dream. In France  Pierre Soulages has already painted his best canvases  but a new Expressionist scene was beginning to emerge in Germany  with Gerhard Richter and Sigmar Polke  Georg Baselitz  and Anselm Kiefer  among others. Their work unfolded over many years and therefore did not produce the same concentration of market value as the American Pop Art movement.The success of this movement was notably due to a relatively small number of series of works on which collectors focused heavily  and these series were created by the great names of American Pop Art and were generally worked and reworked for a few years... around 1964.SourcesArt Basel may be busy  but cautious sales reflect a complex market picture  Amy Shaw  The Art Newspaper  le 15 June 2023.https://www.theartnewspaper.com/2023/06/15/art-basel-may-be-busy-but-cautious-sales-reflect-a-complex-market-picture1964: P op A rt arrives in Europe  a betrayal as seen from France  Thomas Sn√©garoff  France Info  2 October 2015.https://www.francetvinfo.fr/replay-radio/histoires-d-info/1964-le-pop-art-debarque-en-europe-une-trahison-vue-de-france_1788541.htmlMarket analysis of works created by the Warhol-Basquiat duo exhibited at the Louis Vuitton Foundation  Artprice  25 April 2023https://www.artprice.com/artmarketinsight/works-co-signed-by-jean-michel-basquiat-and-andy-warhol-are-currently-showing-at-the-fondation-louis-vuitton-in-parisImages:[ https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/06/image1-1964-artmarket-com-auction-turnover-by-year-of-creation-in-painting.png ][ https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/06/image2-1964-artmarket-com-top-15-auction-prices-artworks-produced-in-1964.png ]Copyright 1987-2023 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to c ontact our E conometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: econometrics@artprice.comTry our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demoSubscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

In an interview with journalist Amy Shaw for the Art Newspaper at Art Basel  art dealer Dominique L√©vy said he detects the presence of a ""clear correction"". Artprice takes this opportunity to review the acceleration of the art market since the beginning of the 21st century  via a quick look at the works that the market values the most.Auction turnover (2000-2022) by year of creation in painting Top 15 auction prices for artworks produced in 1964Auction turnover (2000-2022) by year of creation in paintingPhoto - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2141769/year_of_creation_in_painting.jpg""The analysis of auctions results is a fascinating way to examine the evolution of Art History""  explains thierry Ehrmann  President of Artmarket.com and Founder of Artprice. ""Our databases  have collected objective and comprehensive Fine Art auction data for more than 30 years from all over the world. They therefore provide an extraordinary tool for studying the appetites of collectors and revealing what our contemporaries value the most"".The triumph of Pop ArtIn 1964  Andy Warhol  Roy Lichtenstein  Robert Rauschenberg  and Ed Ruscha were at the peak of their careers and these four artists all have auction price records for works created that year  in the midst of the Cold War  just a few months after the assassination of President J.F. Kennedy. These records  to which must be added more than thirteen thousand other auction results for artworks made that year  make 1964 the year-of-creation that generated the greatest volume of auction turnover in the period 2000 to 2023 (twenty-two years)  all creative periods combined: $2.48 billion.Having fetched the second best art auction result of all time at $195 million on 9 May 2022 at Christie's in New York  Andy Warhol's Shot sage blue Marilyn (1964) is now a sort of figurehead for that year (1964). Although from a market perspective the previous two years were just as important for Warhol  1964 is also remembered in the art world for another reason: in 1964 Robert Rauschenberg won the Grand Prize at the Venice Biennale. Indeed  promoted by Leo Castelli (and perhaps even supported by the CIA)  in 1964 Pop Art imposed itself in the art world thereby consolidating a significant shift of art (and the art market) to the West‚Ä¶ a transfer of power from Paris to New York on the international scene. The way this transfer came about has been the subject of intense discussion.Top 15 auction prices for artworks produced in 1964Photo - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2141770/artworks_produced_in_1964.jpgAbstraction  Pop Art and ExpressionismIn the mid-1960s  several major artists of the first half of the 20th century were still creating important works. Pablo Picasso  Alberto Giacometti  and Ren√© Magritte were still active. In Asia  Li Keran and Fu Baoshi were perpetuating the art of traditional Chinese painting by giving it very personal touches of modernity  while in Europe Zao Wou-Ki and some of his compatriots were exploring Lyrical Abstraction. In England  a new generation was making its mark: David Hockney was 27 in 1964  Frank Auerbach was 33 and Lucien Freud was 42. They were just at the beginning of their careers  but that year Francis Bacon  aged 55  painted some of his best portraits.In the United States  Mark Rothko  Barnett Newman  Willem De Kooning  and Clyfford Still were still exploring Abstract Expressionism and Jackson Pollock had passed away a few year back  while a new artistic revolution was emerging: Pop Art. It was this movement that truly imposed America on the international art scene and the international art market. The works themselves were often brilliant and eye-catching but they also often contained covert or less-covert criticism of the American dream. In France  Pierre Soulages has already painted his best canvases  but a new Expressionist scene was beginning to emerge in Germany  with Gerhard Richter and Sigmar Polke  Georg Baselitz  and Anselm Kiefer  among others. Their work unfolded over many years and therefore did not produce the same concentration of market value as the American Pop Art movement.The success of this movement was notably due to a relatively small number of series of works on which collectors focused heavily  and these series were created by the great names of American Pop Art and were generally worked and reworked for a few years... around 1964.SourcesArt Basel may be busy  but cautious sales reflect a complex market picture  Amy Shaw  The Art Newspaper  le 15 June 2023.https://www.theartnewspaper.com/2023/06/15/art-basel-may-be-busy-but-cautious-sales-reflect-a-complex-market-picture1964: Pop Art arrives in Europe  a betrayal as seen from France  Thomas Sn√©garoff  France Info  2 October 2015.https://www.francetvinfo.fr/replay-radio/histoires-d-info/1964-le-pop-art-debarque-en-europe-une-trahison-vue-de-france_1788541.htmlMarket analysis of works created by the Warhol-Basquiat duo exhibited at the Louis Vuitton Foundation  Artprice  25 April 2023https://www.artprice.com/artmarketinsight/works-co-signed-by-jean-michel-basquiat-and-andy-warhol-are-currently-showing-at-the-fondation-louis-vuitton-in-parisImages:[https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/06/image1-1964-artmarket-com-auction-turnover-by-year-of-creation-in-painting.png][https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/06/image2-1964-artmarket-com-top-15-auction-prices-artw Roy Lichtenstein orks-produced-in-1964.png]Copyright 1987-2023 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to contact our Econometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: [email protected]for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: Try our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demo(free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demo Subscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

The shares have been held in Russia by a different depositary bank.In the circular  Deutsche attributed the shortfall to a decision by Moscow to allow investors to convert some of the DRs into local stock. The conversion was carried out without the German bank's ""involvement or oversight"" and Deutsche was unable to reconcile the company shares with the depositary receipts.It is the first major bank to formally inform depositary receipt holders that they may not get take ownership of precisely all the shares they are entitled to  two sources advising investors who continue to hold Russian DRs told Reuters.DRs are certificates issued by a bank representing shares in a foreign company traded on a local stock exchange. Swapping DRs for shares in the Russian company is a first step towards an effort to recover their money.Shares affected include those in national airline Aeroflot (AFLT.MM)  construction firm LSR Group (LSRG.MM)  mining and steel firm Mechel (MTLR.MM) and Novolipetsk Steel (NLMK.MM). Mechel declined to comment  while the remaining companies did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comments.Western sanctions and Russian countermeasures have stranded assets held by citizens and companies on both sides of the political divide. Moscow is also demanding a 10% contribution to the federal budget  termed an ""exit tax"" by Washington.The Kremlin has also taken assets under temporary control  seizing the Russian subsidiaries of two European energy firms in April  underscoring a strategy to lessen foreign influence on companies critical of its economic and political interests.A significant number of investors ranging from small hedge funds to big global asset managers still hold depositary receipts  investor sources said.Most investors have marked down Russian assets to zero but some still harbour hopes of recovering value in the future.Irina Tsukerman  president at geopolitical risk consultancy Scarab Rising  said the news should come as no surprise.""Literally everything in Russia has been vulnerable  whether its these DRs  equities  real estate or any other form of financial asset "" she told Reuters.The Central Bank of Russia did not immediately comment on the matter.Russia's National Settlement Depository said the conversion of shares had been carried out in accordance with Russian legislation and that it was not the accounting institution responsible for implementing this mechanism.'COMPLETE CHAOS'Lawyers and other advisers have described the conversion process as ""complete chaos"".""To a certain extent  this resulted in double counting because  without a reconciliation between Russia and foreign banks  an investor could get Russian shares and still hold the DRs at the foreign bank "" said Grigory Marinichev  a partner at law firm Morgan Lewis.Deutsche Bank is now allowing investors to swap DRs for shares as part of its plans to exit all Russia business  one source said.The bank also determined that clients could be in a better position if they could convert their DRs at least partially  this person added.JPMorgan & Chase (JPM.N)  Citigroup (C.N) and BNY Mellon (BK.N) act as depositary banks for most other Russian depositary receipt programs  according to Clearstream.All three banks declined to comment on whether they had also identified shortfalls  but their books remain closed due to the challenges with reconciliation  according to statements on their websites.Deutsche said in its circular that if it was able to reconcile its books at a later date  then it would look to return more shares to their rightful owners.But it cautioned that the net proceeds from sales of shares it was able to return to investors would likely be ""substantially lower"" than the current market price.The bank said it understood Russia's Government Commission for Control over Foreign Investments required that such shares be sold ""at a discount of at least 50% from their appraised market value "" the circular

Behind the scenes  efforts are afoot in Switzerland to distribute tokens and coins on an industrial scale. Driving the movement are powerful but secretive players ,Crypto has been the subject of scandals and lawsuits. Behind the scenes  efforts are afoot in Switzerland to distribute tokens and coins on an industrial scale. Driving the movement are powerful but secretive players  a survey made exclusively available to finews.com shows.¬´We like winter ¬ª Ophelia Snyder and Hany Rashwan  founders of Swiss crypto unicorn 21Shares  told finews.com because it's easier to focus on new ideas in a bear market given fewer distractions and ¬´tourists.¬ªThey made the remark in September before the FTX bankruptcy and the Securities and Exchange Commission's lawsuits against the two leading trading platforms  Binance and Coinbase. One might think the crypto winter has turned even colder.Rendezvous at Point Zero ForumAs it turns out  preparations are underway to profit from the next upswing  not just at 21 Shares  but on an industry-wide basis. This is evident not only from the reports of crypto aficionados attending the ¬´Point Zero Forum¬ª in Zurich but also from the analysis by large  established forces in the Swiss financial market.Financial infrastructure group SIX which operates the SIX Digital Exchange  recently published a survey of 300 investment professionals worldwide. It showed 69 percent intend to hold digital tokens in their portfolios over the next twelve months.Pricewaterhouse Coopers (PWC) Switzerland recently surveyed 35 local banks  asset managers  family offices  and pension funds about their crypto plans  giving an idea of the broad popularity that digital investments are now enjoying. The results were made exclusively available to finews.com.On Agendas EverywhereOver 70 percent of the banks surveyed believe tokens and coins can be turned into a profitable business in the next two to three years. As many as 94 percent of financial institutions have put crypto on their strategic agendas.One important driver of demand is a group that doesn't like to make a fuss about itself: family offices. The secretive asset managers of wealthy families are more committed to crypto than other participants. In Switzerland  up to 30 percent are invested in blockchain or crypto  which could rise to 80 percent within three to four years  according to PWC.House Bank DissatisfactionThe study doesn't explore the motives  but it's safe to say family offices are dealing with a younger generation of heirs considered to be particularly crypto-savvy. When wealthy heirs call for offers  banks cannot afford to stay sidelined for very long because dissatisfaction is spreading.Only three out of ten customers are satisfied with the crypto offerings of their house bank. Many still don't offer much more than trading and custody of digital assets. Advisors feel it would take dedicated funds  wealth management mandates  and the opportunity for exclusive deals to meet the needs of their clientele.Contrary to IdeologyUnlike in the pioneering phase  financial institutions no longer have to build everything themselves. Swiss crypto banks Seba and Sygnum are fully regulated suppliers of crypto products  and Bitcoin Suisse is targeting institutional clients. Crypto Finance  a Swiss subsidiary of Deutsche Borse spent the last few months building a platform for launching crypto financial products. Others prospecting for business from third-party providers are online bank Swissquote and transaction bank Incore.It's difficult to reconcile established financial institutions being the beneficiaries of the trend toward crypto with the ideology of a start-up. The movement once envisioned a financial system outside the traditional industry and without intermediaries. But recent scandals have demonstrated the value of regulated offerings as demonstrated by FTX serving global clients from the Bahamas. With Binance  it's unclear where the headquarters of the world's largest crypto exchange should even be.Swiss Have a Strong HandThese are precisely the arguments being made in lawsuits filed by American authorities against leading participants. Many observers see a backlash of supervision from US authorities seemingly intent on institutionalizing the nascent market by curbing or shutting down new players as they emerge.While this tug-of-war has only just begun in America  Switzerland boasts advanced regulation for blockchain offerings and full oversight. All that remains is for the financial industry to play its well-dealt hand skillfully.,neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,mixed,0.16,0.12,0.72,True,English,"['Crypto', 'Push', 'Switzerland', 'next two to three years', 'three to four years', 'two leading trading platforms', 'PWC.

(Prosus) (AEX and JSE: PRX): Shareholders are advised that the company‚Äôs annual report (including consolidated annual financial statements) for the year ended 31 March 2023 will be available on the company‚Äôs website  www.prosus.com  this morning  Tuesday  27 June 2023.The summarised consolidated financial statements together with additional supporting information for the annual report will also be published on the website  www.prosus.com  together with the annual report.Update regarding the annual general meeting 2023The notice of the hybrid annual general meeting  including the agenda with explanatory notes  together with the power of attorney  will be made available on the company‚Äôs website at www.prosus.com at a later date. The annual general meeting is expected to be held at 14:00 on Wednesday  23 August 2023.Further shareholders are advised that the company‚Äôs board of directors recommends that  in total  shareholders receive a distribution (in the form of a capital repayment for holders of ordinary shares N and a dividend for holders of ordinary shares B and ordinary shares A1) of approximately ‚Ç¨175m  which currently represents an increase of approximately 7% for free-float shareholders. Holders of ordinary shares B and ordinary shares A1 will receive an amount per share equal to their economic entitlement as set out in the articles of association. Furthermore  the board recommends that those holders of ordinary shares N as at 3 November 2023 (the dividend record date) who do not wish to receive a capital repayment  can choose to receive a dividend instead. A choice for one option implies an opt-out from the other. If confirmed by shareholders at the annual general meeting on 23 August 2023  elections to receive a dividend instead of a capital repayment will need to be made by holders of ordinary shares N by 20 November 2023. More information regarding the distribution will be published in the notice of annual general meeting.Capital repayments and dividends will be payable to shareholders recorded in our books on the dividend record date and paid on 28 November 2023. Capital repayments will be paid from qualifying share capital for Dutch tax purposes. No dividend withholding tax will be withheld on the amounts of capital reductions paid to shareholders. However  if holders of ordinary shares N rather elect to receive a dividend from retained earnings  dividends will be subject to the Dutch dividend withholding tax rate of 15%.Dividends payable to holders of ordinary shares N who elect to receive a dividend and who hold their listed ordinary shares N through the listing of the company on the JSE will  in addition to the 15% Dutch dividend withholding tax  be subject to South African dividend tax at a rate of up to 20%. The amount of additional South African dividend tax will be calculated by deducting from the 20%  a rebate equal to the Dutch dividend tax paid in respect of the dividend (without right of recovery). Shareholders holding their listed ordinary shares N through the listing of the company on the JSE  unless exempt from paying South African dividend tax or entitled to a reduced withholding tax rate in terms of an applicable tax treaty  will be subject to a maximum of 20% South African dividend tax.Euronext listing agentING Bank N.V.Euronext paying agentABN AMRO Bank N.V.JSE SponsorInvestec Bank LimitedAbout ProsusProsus is a global consumer internet group and one of the largest technology investors in the world.

Tackling systemic obstacles will require investment  better ‚Ä¶,Stacey Caywood  Chief Executive Officer of Wolters Kluwer Health  is focused on identifying ways to overcome the long-term challenges of widespread inequities in global health. Tackling systemic obstacles will require investment  better use of health data  and trustworthy medical information resources  according to Caywood who was discussing these elements of Wolters Kluwer‚Äôs Best Care Everywhere program in a recent interview on MarketScale.In her discussion with MarketScale  Caywood emphasizes that tackling health inequity ‚Äúis in our DNA‚Äù at Wolters Kluwer  to deliver the best care everywhere. She discusses the three steps Wolters Kluwer is taking to address the ongoing challenge of achieving health equity.‚ÄúFirst  we have a US and global donation program  working with partners like Ariadne Labs to provide more access to the best evidence no matter where you live ‚Äù Caywood says  referring to Wolters Kluwer‚Äôs partnerships with the Better Evidence program at Ariadne Labs  a joint center at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health  and with the Society of General Internal Medicine. Through these programs  Wolters Kluwer provides complimentary UpToDate subscriptions to qualifying health workers on the frontlines of care who are working hard to make life-or-death decisions  often without access to the latest clinical evidence.Caywood continues: ‚ÄúSecond  we know you can‚Äôt fix health equity if you can‚Äôt find it  and you need health data to do that. Our Health Language team is mapping that disparate data to make sense of it  to help populations that are most at risk.‚Äù Aggregating different data sources and formats can obscure population health insights. Standardizing them for uniformity can unlock real-time insights to inform population and patient health management and quality reporting programs.The third point Caywood discusses is a focus on guiding healthcare towards inclusivity and equity: ‚ÄúDelivering the best care everywhere starts at the core content and tools that clinicians are using every day. This means reducing unconscious bias in those resources that can negatively impact patient care decisions. This also applies to supporting the training and the delivery that‚Äôs needed  so that everyone has access to the best care  one improved decision at a time.‚ÄùTo help realize this goal  Wolters Kluwer launched a DE&I Content Guide for Healthcare. The language of healthcare consists of anything that is written  visual  spoken  or in any way communicated to healthcare professionals and patients  guiding the decisions they make. Bias in healthcare language can have a detrimental impact on patient care. The guide promotes the development and updating of unbiased and culturally sensitive content. The resource seeks to ensure content is representative of the diverse customers  healthcare providers  students  and patients Wolters Kluwer serves  so clinical decisions are based on bias-free evidence.Watch the full MarketScale interview with Stacey Caywood.Wolters Kluwer Health provides trusted clinical technology and evidence-based solutions that engage clinicians  patients  researchers and students in effective decision-making and outcomes across healthcare.

Digital Enabler Solution Know-how (DESK) Company listed on the Euronext Growth Milan market (Ticker: RLT)  is proud to announce the publication of its third Group ESG Report. This report  which accounts for the fiscal year 2022  highlights the company's ongoing commitment and significant achievements in pursuing sustainability in several key aspects  Human Value  Environment  Research Projects  Strategic Ecosystem  without neglecting the importance of having a responsible Governance and Business. The ESG 2022 Report represents a transparent commitment to sustainability and corporate social responsibility. The companies that joined the Relatech Group in the reporting year 2022 have also been included in the scope of analysis  and through this report  the Group communicates to its ecosystem of stakeholders  including investors  employees  customers and communities  the progress achieved and the challenges faced in pursuing sustainable growth. Distinctive factors that emerged in the ESG 2022 Report include: 1. Human Value: Relatech recognises the fundamental value of people and is committed to promoting an inclusive  safe and healthy working environment through training and development programmes  wellness initiatives and diversity and inclusion policies. Relatech places its employees at the centre of its sustainable strategy and promotes the wellbeing of the individual through training actions that are not only professional but also and above all for the wellbeing of the individual. For this reason  it is about three years ago that Relatech launched the internal coaching project ReCoach  which has involved more than 30% of the Relatech Group's employees and becomes a concrete manifestation of the 12 Corporate Values  the cardinal principles of corporate identity and ethics  with the ultimate aim of further enhancing the potential and soft skills of the individual and the group by fostering a healthy development of the company.Open Innovation and Research : Relatech together with its ecosystem constantly invests in Open Innovation  and through collaborations with universities and research centres  numerous projects have been realised to develop innovative and sustainable solutions for environmental and social challenges. Some of the topics are  for example  bio-sustainable agriculture  systems for monitoring and optimising city mobility  reductions in emissions and energy consumption  and in the field of healthcare  applications investigating how to improve the support of frail and sensory impaired patients. In-house research and collaborations with academic institutes and industrial partners have led to important achievements in carbon reduction  energy efficiency and natural resource management. Strategic Ecosystem : Relatech Group starts from the conviction that sustainability goes beyond the organisation's boundaries and is committed to building a strategic ecosystem with partners  suppliers  customers  with the aim of activating a circular value chain  also by building Innovation Hubs around its offices both nationally and internationally. Through collaborations  knowledge sharing and community engagement  the company aims to promote innovation and the adoption of sustainable practices across the industry. Pasquale Lambardi  Chairman of Relatech's Board of Directors commented:""We are excited to present the Group's ESG 2022 Report  which testifies to our ongoing commitment to responsible and sustainable growth both economically and in business  always taking into account Environmental  Social and Governance issues. The United Nations' Agenda 2030  which identifies 17 interconnected goals as a strategy to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all  makes us increasingly aware of the importance of addressing global challenges and spurs us to work tenaciously to create a positive impact on people  communities and the planet. The ESG 2022 Report outlines the roadmap to follow and monitor the group's progress and is for us just the beginning of a broader journey that aims to create an Ecosystem of stakeholders taking common action and working together for a sustainable future."" The ESG 2022 Report is available on the company's website on the Sustainability page (link).Stock Grant Plan 2021 - 2023 The Company announces that  today  the Board of Directors of the Company  has verified the achievement of certain objectives set forth in the ""Stock Grant Plan 2021 - 2023"" incentive plan with reference to the financial year ending 31 December 2022 and has assigned to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Pasquale Lambardi  nr. 258 109 treasury shares held by Relatech and to the Vice Chairman  Gianni Franco Papa  nr. 60 000 treasury shares held by Relatech. Definition of compensation in kind with reference to the acquisition of BTO Further to what was communicated on 28 October 2022 in relation to the acquisition of 80% of the share capital of BTO S.p.A.  the company announces that today an agreement was reached to determine the compensation in kind  which envisages the payment  to a non- operating shareholder and within thirty days from today's date  of a total of 270 000 Relatech treasury shares valued at the price of EUR 5 each. As part of the agreement  Relatech has agreed to waive the lock-up commitments initially agreed upon in relation to the aforesaid shares on condition that the aforementioned non-operating shareholder completes a sale of the same shares to be carried out off-market  with the aim of benefiting from a consequent increase in the Company's free float. Finally  it should be noted that net of the shares granted under the aforesaid stock grant plan  and of those that will be granted to the non-operating shareholder as consideration in kind in the context of the acquisition of BTO  the Company would hold 749 131 treasury shares. Insight ""Materiality analysis 2022"" Following the entry into force of the new GRI standards (1 January 2023)  Relatech has adapted its reporting system with particular effect on the materiality analysis: if previously the analysis was based on the study of the relevance of each theme (e.g. ""Ethics and integrity in the conduct of business""  ""Combating climate change and emissions management""  etc.) from the point of view of the company itself and its stakeholders  the new standards are now oriented towards impact materiality  focusing on the assessment ofnon-financialimpacts that  in the case of Relatech  are not financial. ) from the point of view of the company itself and its stakeholders  the new regulation moves towards impact materiality  focusing on the assessment of the non-financial impacts that Relatech and its group companies and value chain generate or could generate on the economic  environmental and social spheres. For the stakeholders of the Relatech ecosystem  the materiality issues whose impacts are very likely to be significant are ""Respect for human rights and protection of workers""  ""personnel training"" within the social responsibility category; instead  within the ""product responsibility"" category  the issues of ""technological innovation and digitalisation"" are relevant  as well as the Group's offer in terms of ""cybersecurity"".",neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.4,0.22,0.38,True,English,"['2021-2023 stock grant plan', 'ESG Report', 'financial year', 'Relatech', 'Publication', 'achievement', 'targets', 'reference', 'Digital Enabler Solution Know-how', ""The United Nations' Agenda 2030"", 'Euronext Growth Milan market', 'Relatech S.p.A.', 'third Group ESG Report', 'several key aspects', 'internal coaching project', 'sensory impaired patients', 'natural resource management', 'Chief Executive Officer', 'Gianni Franco Papa', 'Stock Grant Plan', 'circular value chain', 'ESG 2022 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS', 'The ESG 2022 Report', 'PRESS RELEASE PUBLICATION', 'corporate social responsibility', 'healthy working environment', 'BTO Milan', 'sustainable growth', 'healthy development', 'FINANCIAL YEAR', '12 Corporate Values', 'corporate identity', 'Human Value', 'fundamental value', 'CERTAIN TARGETS', '27th June', 'fiscal year', 'ongoing commitment', 'significant achievements', 'transparent commitment', 'reporting year', 'Distinctive factors', 'inclusive, safe', 'development programmes', 'wellness initiatives', 'inclusion policies', 'concrete manifestation', 'cardinal principles', 'soft skills', 'numerous projects', 'sustainable solutions', 'social challenges', 'bio-sustainable agriculture', 'city mobility', 'energy consumption', 'academic institutes', 'important achievements', 'carbon reduction', 'energy efficiency', 'knowledge sharing', 'community engagement', 'sustainable practices', 'Pasquale Lambardi', 'Governance issues', '17 interconnected goals', 'sustainable future', 'positive impact', 'broader journey', 'common action', '258,109 treasury shares', '60,000 treasury shares', 'Environmental, Social', 'Research Projects', 'Open Innovation', 'research centres', 'house research', 'Innovation Hubs', 'global challenges', 'Strategic Ecosystem', 'responsible Governance', 'sustainable strategy', 'training actions', 'ultimate aim', 'industrial partners', 'Vice Chairman', 'Relatech Group', 'Sustainability page', 'DESK) Company', 'REFERENCE', 'DEFINITION', 'COMPENSATION', 'KIND', 'ACQUISITION', 'Ticker', 'RLT', 'importance', 'Business', 'companies', 'scope', 'analysis', 'stakeholders', 'investors', 'employees', 'customers', 'communities', 'progress', 'people', 'diversity', 'wellbeing', 'individual', 'reason', 'ReCoach', 'ethics', 'potential', 'collaborations', 'universities', 'innovative', 'topics', 'example', 'systems', 'monitoring', 'reductions', 'emissions', 'field', 'healthcare', 'applications', 'support', 'frail', 'conviction', 'organisation', 'boundaries', 'suppliers', 'offices', 'adoption', 'industry', 'Board', 'Directors', 'account', 'planet', 'roadmap', 'beginning', 'website', 'link', 'objectives', '31 December', 'nr', '1.']",2023-06-27,2023-06-28,marketscreener.com

This inauguration marks a step forward in the two companies‚Äô commitment to the development of hydrogen mobility in Europe  in line with the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed in December 2021. The MoU aims to advance hydrogen as a crucial enabler for the energy transition of the transport industry by leveraging the unique expertise of Air Liquide across the entire hydrogen value chain  from production and storage to distribution  and the know-how of IVECO  the commercial vehicle brand of Iveco Group (MI: IVG)  a pioneer in the manufacturing of vehicles powered by alternative fuels.Guests at the inauguration that took place on 26th June 2023 had the opportunity to visit the large-capacity high-pressure station (1 ton/day) supplied with low-carbon hydrogen via pipeline  and to see first-hand a prototype of an IVECO heavy-duty fuel cell truck. This transport solution for long haulage features a fast refuelling time at 700-bar pressure.The Fos-sur-Mer station is part of the HyAMMED (‚ÄúHydrog√®ne √† Aix-Marseille pour une Mobilit√© Ecologique et Durable‚Äù) project supported by French funding. The new station is also part of H2Haul  the European project co-financed by the Clean Hydrogen Partnership. Air Liquide and IVECO were among the first partners of the H2Haul project when it was launched in 2019. A second high-capacity station (700 bar  2 tons/day) dedicated to heavy vehicles will be installed in Salon-de-Provence to supply a potential fleet of 50 hydrogen IVECO trucks from 2025 in the framework of the R‚ÄôHyse project.Erwin Penfornis  Vice-President Hydrogen Energy World Business Line  Air Liquide  said: ‚ÄúTo encourage the widespread use of hydrogen  we must collectively create the conditions for the sector to flourish. It is imperative to develop a network of high-capacity stations dense enough to enable vehicle manufacturers and transport operators to embark on this transition. The HyAMMED project is part of this approach: it's a decisive first step and the kick-off to a greater ambition that we share with our partner IVECO.‚ÄùGerrit Marx  CEO  Iveco Group  affirmed: ‚ÄúOur strategy for increasingly sustainable mobility is based on a technology-neutral approach and hydrogen mobility is a key building block on this path. In fact  it provides an essential solution for high energy demanding commercial vehicle applications  such as long-haul transport. Today we showed that we have all the capabilities  both the vehicles and the stations  to put a true hydrogen mobility ecosystem on the road: the strategy is becoming reality. And our new  all-inclusive  pay-per-use rental model GATE - Green & Advanced Transport Ecosystem will enable access to the hydrogen-powered vehicles. Today‚Äôs milestone allows us to further strengthen the strategic and fundamental partnership with Air Liquide  a leader on the international energy transition scene that  like Iveco Group  works to advance a more sustainable society.‚ÄùThe HyAMMED project  part of the H2Haul programme (Hydrogen fuel cell trucks for heavy-duty  zero emission logistics)  has received funding from the Clean Hydrogen Partnership under grant agreement no. 826236. This public-private partnership is supported by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme  Hydrogen Europe and Hydrogen Europe Research. The HyAMMED project has also received financial support from the Hydrogen Mobility Ecosystems.The HyAMMED project has also received financial support from the Hydrogen Mobility Ecosystem Program run by ADEME  from the R√©gion Sud  and from the French government as part of the Programme d'investissements d'avenir (PIA).The R'Hyse project has received funding from ADEME and the European Union (Connecting Europe Facility for Transport).About Air LiquideA world leader in gases  technologies and services for Industry and Health  Air Liquide is present in 73 countries with approximately 67 100 employees and serves more than 3.9 million customers and patients.

As of 20 June 2023  the platform began producing its first kilos of offshore hydrogen  marking a decisive milestone for the future of the sector. The progress of the Sealhyfe trial once again demonstrates Lhyfe's ability to bring about concrete advances in the hydrogen industry and at great strides.Sealhyfe: Designed to meet unprecedented challengesIn launching the world's first offshore hydrogen production pilot  Lhyfe wanted to prove the technical feasibility of such a project and acquire the operational experience needed to quickly scale up.The company therefore voluntarily chose to confront Sealhyfe with the toughest conditions. It will be tested under real conditions  on a floating platform  which has been re-engineered to stabilise the production unit at sea (the WAVEGEM platform  engineered by GEPS Techno)  and connected to Central Nantes' SEM-REV offshore testing hub operated by the OPEN-C Foundation  which is already linked with a floating wine turbine (FLOATGEN  engineered and operated by BW Ideol).For this  Lhyfe and its partners designed  built and assembled all of the technology necessary for producing hydrogen offshore  including the 1 MW electrolyser supplied by Plug  in just 16 months. The Sealhyfe platform  which is less than 200 sq. metres in area  is capable of producing up to 400 kilograms of hydrogen a day.Eight months of trials at quay to ‚Äúderisk‚Äù this world firstFrom September 2022 to May 2023  Sealhyfe was moored at the Quai des Fr√©gates  in the Port of Saint-Nazaire. Lhyfe and its partners have thus been able to draw knowledge from a series of start-up tests in order to approach the second phase of the project with confidence  and get the most out of the trials.

Technology and system optimisation : All of the technology has been adapted to operate offshore in extreme conditions and designed to minimise the number of maintenance interventions required at sea. The tests performed at quay allowed Lhyfe to further optimise and approve the technology's behaviour.: All of the technology has been adapted to operate offshore in extreme conditions and designed to minimise the number of maintenance interventions required at sea. The tests performed at quay allowed Lhyfe to further optimise and approve the technology's behaviour. Development of key solutions: Lhyfe also developed the software and algorithm building blocks necessary to manage the site remotely. It will operate fully autonomously  more than 20 kilometres off the coast and in connection with the SEM-REV testing site's subsea hub.Following this first phase  Lhyfe has already updated its specifications for all its sites ‚Äì on and offshore ‚Äì so that they can apply this valuable expertise. All Lhyfe units will therefore benefit from the state-of-the-art operating optimisations trialled under this experiment.Start of offshore production: Millions of data to collectSealhyfe was towed this 19 May to the SEM-REV offshore testing site  20 kilometres off the coast of Le Croisic (France). It was then connected to the site's subsea hub via a dedicated umbilical cable that was specially designed for the hydrogen application. The system was restarted and on stream in just 48 hours.Lhyfe will now reproduce all of the tests carried out at quay several times in order to have a strict comparison of results and will then tackle additional offshore-specific tests.In achieving the reliable offshore production of hydrogen in an isolated environment  the company will develop a unique operating capability which involves managing the platform's movement and environmental stresses  and validating green and renewable hydrogen production software and algorithms.Kick-off for offshore hydrogen production: Next stepsAs a logical follow-up to this first stage  Lhyfe just announced that the HOPE project  which it is coordinating as part of a consortium of nine partners  has been selected by the European Commission under the European Clean Hydrogen Partnership and is being awarded a ‚Ç¨20 million grant. With HOPE  Lhyfe and its partners are moving up a gear and aiming for commercialisation. This unprecedentedly large-scale project (10 MW) will be able to produce up to four tonnes a day of green hydrogen at sea  which will be exported ashore by pipeline  and then compressed and delivered to customers.Through these two pioneering projects in offshore hydrogen production  Lhyfe aims to validate industrial solutions which it will submit in response to future calls for projects from various governments  to help achieve the target set by the European Commission as part of the REPowerEU plan of 10 million tonnes of clean hydrogen produced in the European Union by 2030.To achieve this  Lhyfe has already signed partnership agreements with wind turbine developers and offshore power specialists  such as EDPR  Centrica and Capital Energy.Matthieu Guesn√©  Founder and CEO of Lhyfe said: ‚ÄúOur team ‚Äì supported brilliantly by our partners ‚Äì has achieved a genuine feat of technology in successfully designing this first floating green hydrogen production site. We are extremely proud to be the first in the world to produce hydrogen at sea. This has been our wish since the launch of the company and we continue to move very quickly on offshore  which for us represents a tremendous development opportunity for mass producing hydrogen and decarbonising industry and transport. We are continuing to build on the successes we have had so far  firstly to prove to the world that transition is possible today  and of course to accelerate it.‚ÄùFor an interview with the spokespersons above  please contact the press department.Click to access the Lhyfe Media Kit (press kit and visuals)About LhyfeLhyfe is a European group devoted to energy transition  and a producer and supplier of green and renewable hydrogen.

Amlitelimab is currently under clinical investigation  and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.Amlitelimab is a fully human non-depleting monoclonal antibody that binds to OX40-Ligand  a key immune regulator  and has the potential to be a first-in-class treatment for a range of immune-mediated diseases and inflammatory disorders  including moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis and asthma. By targeting OX40-Ligand  amlitelimab aims to restore immune homeostasis between pro-inflammatory and regulatory T cells.""While we have made significant strides in the treatment of atopic dermatitis  there are patients who are still in need of new options. We believe that the results from this Phase 2b study with amlitelimab support our perspective that targeting OX40-Ligand has the potential to provide a first and best-in- class treatment option that addresses type 2 and non-type 2 inflammation to meet the individual needs of people living with atopic dermatitis and other chronic inflammatory diseases. We look forward to advancing into a larger Phase 3 clinical development program and continuing to drive momentum in our Immunology pipeline to deliver first or best-in-class treatments.""In this dose-ranging study  treatment with amlitelimab resulted in statistically significant improvements in average Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score from baseline at 16 weeks compared to placebo for all four subcutaneous doses that were studied. There were also improvements in key secondary outcome measures and continued improvements were observed through week 24 in primary and key secondary outcomes. Biomarker results support an effect on both type 2 and non-type 2 pathways.The primary endpoint was percentage change in EASI from baseline at 16 weeks. Key secondary endpoints included change in EASI from baseline at 24 weeks  percentage of patients with at least a 75% reduction from baseline in EASI at 16 and 24 weeks  percentage of patients with a response of IGA 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) and a reduction from baseline ‚â• 2 points at 16 and 24 weeks  and proportion of patients with improvement (reduction) of weekly average of pruritus NRS ‚â• 4 with a baseline pruritus of ‚â• 4 from baseline at 16 and 24 weeks.The study enrolled 390 people in Australia  Bulgaria  Canada  Czechia  Germany  Hungary  Japan  Poland  Spain  Taiwan  the United Kingdom and the United States.About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people's lives.

Alongside this  the Company is announcing the drawdown of a tranche of ORNAN bonds redeemable in cash and/or new shares (the ‚ÄúORNAN bonds‚Äù) for a total of ‚Ç¨0.25m  with a net subscription price of ‚Ç¨242 500.Share capital reduction through a reduction in the par value of the Company's sharesDuring its meeting on June 15  2023  the Board of Directors (i) decided to use the delegation of authority granted to it by the Combined General Shareholders' Meeting on September 29  2022  under the terms of its 22nd resolution  to reduce the Company's share capital as a result of losses by reducing the par value of the Company's shares  and (ii) granted full powers to the Chairman and CEO to implement this decision.On June 27  2023  the Chairman and CEO  under the powers granted to him by the Board of Directors  decided to reduce the Company's share capital by ‚Ç¨(2 231 795.67) euros  by reducing the par value of the Company's shares from ‚Ç¨0.001 to ‚Ç¨0.0001.This purely technical operation did not impact the number of Company shares outstanding. Following this operation  the Company's share capital now represents ‚Ç¨247 977.30 and comprises 2 479 772 970 ordinary shares with a par value of ‚Ç¨0.0001.Drawdown of an ORNAN bond tranche for a nominal total of ‚Ç¨0.25mIn addition  the Chairman and CEO  under the powers granted to him by the Board of Directors  decided to draw down a tranche of 25 ORNAN bonds today representing a principal total of ‚Ç¨0.25m  with a subscription price of ‚Ç¨242 500.This operation  decided on in accordance with the 17th resolution from the Combined General Shareholders' Meeting on September 29  2022  is being carried out in the context of the financing set up on May 12  2023 for a maximum nominal amount of ‚Ç¨10m  with a view to providing the Company with additional potential financial resources to further strengthen its development and capitalize on opportunities for external growth[1].In addition to further strengthening the Company's capital  these financial resources will support its strategy  combining technology  digital and smart cities.The main characteristics of the warrants (the ‚ÄúWarrants‚Äù) and the ORNAN bonds issued to YA II PN  LTD.  represented by its management company Yorkville Advisors Global  LP (collectively the ‚ÄúInvestor‚Äù) (with the detailed terms and conditions available on the Company's site (www.geci.net) under ‚ÄúInvestor Relations‚Äù) were presented in a press release on May 12  2023.Impact of the drawdown of the tranche of 25 ORNAN bonds on a shareholder's interest based on the share priceFor illustration purposes  the impact of the issue of the tranche of 25 ORNAN bonds on the interest of a shareholder owning 1% of the Company's capital prior to the issue and not subscribing for the issue (calculations based on 2 429 772 970 shares comprising the Company's capital at June 27  2023 and a reference share price equal to GECI International's closing share price on June 22  2023  i.e. ‚Ç¨0.0011) would be as follows:Undiluted basis Diluted basis (2) Prior to issue 1.00% 0.92% Following issue of 250 000 000 new shares(1) resulting from the conversion of the 25 ORNAN bonds subject to this drawdown 0.91% 0.85%Maximum theoretical number of shares that may result from the conversion of a total nominal amount of ‚Ç¨0.25m of ORNAN bonds at a conversion price equal to 93% of the reference share price retained as an assumption (i.e. ‚Ç¨0.001).

Assuming the exercising of all the dilutive instruments that exist to date which could result in the creation of an indicative maximum of 201 850 000 new shares.DISCLAIMERFor reference  on May 12  2023  the Company set up new financing based on ORNAN bonds  to be issued on a staggered basis as the ORNAN Warrants are exercised  with the Investor  which  after receiving the new shares resulting from the conversion of the ORNAN bonds  does not intend to continue to be a Company shareholder.The new shares resulting from the conversion of the ORNAN bonds will in general be sold on the market within very short timeframes  which may create strong downwards pressure on the share price. Shareholders may lose the capital that they have invested as a result of a significant decrease in the value of the Company's share  in addition to a strong level of dilution resulting from the large number of securities issued to the Investor.Investors are invited to take all reasonable care before any decision to invest in the securities of the Company  which carries out such dilutive financing operations  particularly when they are carried out successively. In this respect  the Company reminds investors that this dilutive financing operation is not the first that it has put in place.Specifically  investors are invited to consider the risks relating to such operations  as mentioned below in this press release.NEXT DATE2022-23 full-year earnings scheduled for July 11  2023 after close of trading.ABOUT GECI INTERNATIONAL__________‚ÄúSmart Solutions for a Smart World‚ÄùGECI International is a specialist Technology and Digital group.

PLEASE SEE THE IMPORTANT DISCLAIMERS AT THE END OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.Naspers Limited (""Naspers"") (JSE: NPN):1. INTRODUCTIONThe board of directors of Naspers (the Naspers Board) and the board of directors of Prosus (the Prosus Board) are pleased to announce that Naspers and Prosus (together with their consolidated subsidiaries  the Group) intend to implement a proposed transaction in terms of which the cross-holding structure between Naspers and Prosus (the Cross-Holding Structure) will be removed (the Proposed Transaction). The implementation of the Proposed Transaction will enable the continuation of the share repurchase programme announced by the Group on 27 June 2022(Repurchase Programme) at the Naspers level.The Proposed Transaction is also intended to remove the complexity created by the Cross-Holding Structure while keeping the Naspers and Prosus Free-Float Effective Economic Interests (as defined below) the same as they are prior to the implementation of the Proposed Transaction. This will be achieved through aligning the legal ownership in Prosus with the current respective free-float effective economic interests.The requisite approvals required to implement the Proposed Transaction have been obtained from the South African Reserve Bank in accordance with the South African Exchange Control Regulations.2. BACKGROUND TO THE CROSS-HOLDING AND RATIONALEThe Proposed Transaction is intended to address: (i) the limitation on the Repurchase Programme at the Naspers level arising from the Cross-Holding Structure  and (ii) the complexity arising from the Cross-Holding Structure.The Repurchase Programme commenced on 27 June 2022 and  since inception  the Repurchase Programme has continued to create significant value for both the Naspers and Prosus shareholders and as at 31 March 2023  resulted in a c. 18% reduction in the discount to NAV at a Naspers level and c. 16% at a Prosus level  unlocking c. US$29 billion of value.The Repurchase Programme is operating at both a Prosus and Naspers level to ensure that the Naspers Free-Float Effective Economic Interest and the Prosus Free-Float Effective Economic Interest (as defined below)  remain in balance over time.As the Repurchase Programme at the Naspers level is being implemented through acquisitions by one of its South African subsidiaries  there is  however  a limit under the South African Companies Act  71 of 2008  as to the amount of Naspers shares that can be acquired in this manner pursuant to the Repurchase Programme. The Proposed Transaction will remove this limitation and enable the Repurchase Programme to continue at the Naspers level. This limitation does not apply to the Repurchase Programme at the Prosus level  which continues.In addition  in August 2021 Naspers and Prosus completed an exchange offer in which Prosus issued new Prosus ordinary shares N (Prosus Ordinary Shares N) to the holders (Naspers N Shareholders or Naspers Free-Float Shareholders) of Naspers N ordinary shares (Naspers N Ordinary Shares) that accepted such exchange offer  in exchange for acquiring their Naspers N Ordinary Shares (the Exchange Offer).The core objective of the Exchange Offer was to further reduce the oversized weight of Naspers in the Shareholder Weighted Index of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (the JSE SWIX). Naspers was around 23% of the JSE SWIX immediately prior to the implementation of the Exchange Offer.The implementation of the Exchange Offer:resulted in the Cross-Holding Structure in terms of which Naspers currently holds c. 60% of the issued Prosus Ordinary Shares N and Prosus currently holds c. 49% of the issued Naspers N Ordinary Shares;required the implementation of a cross-holding agreement between Naspers and Prosus on 27 May 2021 to ensure efficient and effective ongoing interaction between Prosus and Naspers through making distributions on a ""terminal economic value'' basis (the Cross-Holding Agreement). The ""terminal economic value"" distribution arrangements are entrenched in the Cross-Holding Agreement as well as through amendments to the articles of association of Prosus (the Prosus Articles of Association) and are referred to as the Cross-Holding Arrangements; andestablished the effective economic interests of the Naspers Free-Float Shareholders in the underlying Prosus portfolio currently at c. 43% (the Naspers Free-Float Effective Economic Interest) and the effective economic interest of the holders of the Prosus Ordinary Shares N (Prosus Free-Float Shareholders or Prosus N Shareholders) in the underlying Prosus portfolio currently at c. 57% (the Prosus Free-Float Effective Economic Interest)  under the Cross-Holding Arrangements.The introduction of the Cross-Holding Structure was a consequence of the Exchange Offer which  at the time  was considered by the Naspers Board and Prosus Board as one of the most feasible ways to reduce Naspers's weighting on the JSE SWIX. The Exchange Offer achieved this objective and Naspers's and Prosus's South African listed shares represent approximately 9% of the JSE SWIX (down from 23% prior to the Exchange Offer).The Group expected that the introduction of the Cross-Holding Agreement would reduce the complexity that comes with a cross-holding structure and clarify the market's understanding of the true economic interests under the Cross-Holding Structure. Since its implementation  however  the Cross-Holding Structure is widely seen as a negative by shareholders. A common shareholder view is that the Cross-Holding Structure introduces excessive complexity  contributes to the holding company discount  and should be removed.The Naspers Board and Prosus Board believe that enabling the continuation of the Repurchase Programme at the Naspers level and removing the complexity arising from the Cross-Holding Structure  pursuant to the Proposed Transaction  will allow the Group to continue to create shareholder value.3. OVERVIEW OF THE PROPOSED TRANSACTIONCurrently  the Prosus Free-Float Effective Economic Interest is c. 57% and the Naspers Free-Float Effective Economic Interest is c. 43%  which is governed by the Cross-Holding Arrangements. The Prosus Free-Float Shareholders own their c. 57% effective economic interest partially through their direct ownership of Prosus Ordinary Shares N (c. 40%) and the balance (c. 17%) through Prosus‚Äôs cross-holding of Naspers N OrdinaryShares.It is currently expected that the implementation of the Proposed Transaction will involve the following key transaction steps:subject to obtaining the requisite approvals of the shareholders of Prosus (Prosus Shareholders)  Prosus will undertake a capitalisation issue of (i) new Prosus Ordinary Shares N to Prosus Free-Float Shareholders (i.e. excluding Naspers)  (ii) new unlisted Prosus ordinary shares B (Prosus Ordinary Shares B) to Naspers  and (iii) new unlisted Prosus ordinary shares A1 (Prosus Ordinary Shares A)  to the holders of the issued Prosus Ordinary Shares A (collectively  the Prosus Capitalisation Issue).

PLEASE SEE THE IMPORTANT DISCLAIMERS AT THE END OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT.Prosus N.V. (Prosus) (AEX and JSE: PRX):1.INTRODUCTIONThe board of directors of Naspers (the Naspers Board) and the board of directors of Prosus (the Prosus Board) are pleased to announce that Naspers and Prosus (together with their consolidated subsidiaries  the Group) intend to implement a proposed transaction in terms of which the cross-holding structure between Naspers and Prosus (the Cross-Holding Structure) will be removed (the Proposed Transaction). The implementation of the Proposed Transaction will enable the continuation of the share repurchase programme announced by the Group on 27 June 2022(Repurchase Programme) at the Naspers level.The Proposed Transaction is also intended to remove the complexity created by the Cross-Holding Structure while keeping the Naspers and Prosus Free-Float Effective Economic Interests (as defined below) the same as they are prior to the implementation of the Proposed Transaction. This will be achieved through aligning the legal ownership in Prosus with the current respective free-float effective economic interests.The requisite approvals required to implement the Proposed Transaction have been obtained from the South African Reserve Bank in accordance with the South African Exchange Control Regulations.2.BACKGROUND TO THE CROSS-HOLDING AND RATIONALEThe Proposed Transaction is intended to address: (i) the limitation on the Repurchase Programme at the Naspers level arising from the Cross-Holding Structure  and (ii) the complexity arising from the Cross-Holding Structure.The Repurchase Programme commenced on 27 June 2022 and  since inception  the Repurchase Programme has continued to create significant value for both the Naspers and Prosus shareholders and as at 31 March 2023  resulted in a c. 18% reduction in the discount to NAV at a Naspers level and c. 16% at a Prosus level  unlocking c. US$29 billion of value.The Repurchase Programme is operating at both a Prosus and Naspers level to ensure that the Naspers Free-Float Effective Economic Interest and the Prosus Free-Float Effective Economic Interest (as defined below)  remain in balance over time.As the Repurchase Programme at the Naspers level is being implemented through acquisitions by one of its South African subsidiaries  there is  however  a limit under the South African Companies Act  71 of 2008  as to the amount of Naspers shares that can be acquired in this manner pursuant to the Repurchase Programme. The Proposed Transaction will remove this limitation and enable the Repurchase Programme to continue at the Naspers level. This limitation does not apply to the Repurchase Programme at the Prosus level  which continues.In addition  in August 2021 Naspers and Prosus completed an exchange offer in which Prosus issued new Prosus ordinary shares N (Prosus Ordinary Shares N) to the holders (Naspers N Shareholders or Naspers Free-Float Shareholders) of Naspers N ordinary shares (Naspers N Ordinary Shares) that accepted such exchange offer  in exchange for acquiring their Naspers N Ordinary Shares (the Exchange Offer).The core objective of the Exchange Offer was to further reduce the oversized weight of Naspers in the Shareholder Weighted Index of the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (the JSE SWIX). Naspers was around 23% of the JSE SWIX immediately prior to the implementation of the Exchange Offer.The implementation of the Exchange Offer:resulted in the Cross-Holding Structure in terms of which Naspers currently holds c. 60% of the issued Prosus Ordinary Shares N and Prosus currently holds c. 49% of the issued Naspers N Ordinary Shares;required the implementation of a cross-holding agreement between Naspers and Prosus on 27 May 2021 to ensure efficient and effective ongoing interaction between Prosus and Naspers through making distributions on a ""terminal economic value'' basis (the Cross-Holding Agreement). The ""terminal economic value"" distribution arrangements are entrenched in the Cross-Holding Agreement as well as through amendments to the articles of association of Prosus (the Prosus Articles of Association) and are referred to as the Cross-Holding Arrangements; andestablished the effective economic interests of the Naspers Free-Float Shareholders in the underlying Prosus portfolio currently at c. 43% (the Naspers Free-Float Effective Economic Interest) and the effective economic interest of the holders of the Prosus Ordinary Shares N (Prosus Free-Float Shareholders or Prosus N Shareholders) in the underlying Prosus portfolio currently at c. 57% (the Prosus Free-Float Effective Economic Interest)  under the Cross-Holding Arrangements.The introduction of the Cross-Holding Structure was a consequence of the Exchange Offer which  at the time  was considered by the Naspers Board and Prosus Board as one of the most feasible ways to reduce Naspers's weighting on the JSE SWIX. The Exchange Offer achieved this objective and Naspers's and Prosus's South African listed shares represent approximately 9% of the JSE SWIX (down from 23% prior to the Exchange Offer).The Group expected that the introduction of the Cross-Holding Agreement would reduce the complexity that comes with a cross-holding structure and clarify the market's understanding of the true economic interests under the Cross-Holding Structure. Since its implementation  however  the Cross-Holding Structure is widely seen as a negative by shareholders. A common shareholder view is that the Cross-Holding Structure introduces excessive complexity  contributes to the holding company discount  and should be removed.The Naspers Board and Prosus Board believe that enabling the continuation of the Repurchase Programme at the Naspers level and removing the complexity arising from the Cross-Holding Structure  pursuant to the Proposed Transaction  will allow the Group to continue to create shareholder value.3.OVERVIEW OF THE PROPOSED TRANSACTIONCurrently  the Prosus Free-Float Effective Economic Interest is c. 57% and the Naspers Free-Float Effective Economic Interest is c. 43%  which is governed by the Cross-Holding Arrangements. The Prosus Free-Float Shareholders own their c. 57% effective economic interest partially through their direct ownership of Prosus Ordinary Shares N (c. 40%) and the balance (c. 17%) through Prosus‚Äôs cross-holding of Naspers N OrdinaryShares.It is currently expected that the implementation of the Proposed Transaction will involve the following key transaction steps:subject to obtaining the requisite approvals of the shareholders of Prosus (Prosus Shareholders)  Prosus will undertake a capitalisation issue of (i) new Prosus Ordinary Shares N to Prosus Free-Float Shareholders (i.e. excluding Naspers)  (ii) new unlisted Prosus ordinary shares B (Prosus Ordinary Shares B) to Naspers  and (iii) new unlisted Prosus ordinary shares A1 (Prosus Ordinary Shares A)  to the holders of the issued Prosus Ordinary Shares A (collectively  the Prosus Capitalisation Issue). Naspers will antecedently and irrevocably waive its entitlement to Prosus Ordinary Shares N and consequently not receive new Prosus Ordinary Shares N under the Prosus Capitalisation Issue. Following the implementation of the Prosus Capitalisation Issue  Naspers‚Äôs direct holding of Prosus Ordinary Shares N will be diluted such that it will be in line with the current Naspers Free-Float Effective Economic Interest of c. 43% under the Cross-Holding Arrangements and the Prosus Free-Float Shareholders' aggregate holding of Prosus Ordinary Shares N will increase such that it will be in line with the current Prosus Free-Float Effective Economic Interest of c. 57% under the Cross-Holding Arrangements;subject to obtaining the requisite approvals of Prosus Shareholders  the articles of association of Prosus will be amended to facilitate the implementation of the Prosus Capitalisation Issue  including the requisite share capital changes and to remove all reference to the Cross-Holding Arrangements;subject to obtaining the requisite approvals of the shareholders of Naspers (Naspers Shareholders)  Naspers will undertake a capitalisation issue of (i) new Naspers N Ordinary Shares to Naspers Free-Float Shareholders (i.e. excluding Prosus)  and (ii) new unlisted A ordinary shares (Naspers A Ordinary Shares) to the holders of the issued Naspers A Ordinary Shares (the Naspers Capitalisation Issue). Prosus will antecedently and irrevocably waive its entitlement to Naspers N Ordinary Shares and consequently not receive new Naspers N Ordinary Shares under the Naspers Capitalisation Issue. Following the implementation of the Naspers Capitalisation Issue  Prosus‚Äôs holding in Naspers will be diluted to a minimal level;subject to obtaining the requisite approvals of Naspers Shareholders  the memorandum of incorporation of Naspers will be amended to facilitate the implementation of the Naspers Capitalisation Issue  including to:- convert the Naspers N Ordinary Shares and Naspers A Ordinary Shares from par value to no-par value shares;- proportionally increase the number of authorised Naspers N Ordinary Shares and Naspers A Ordinary Shares to facilitate the implementation of the large-scale Naspers Capitalisation Issue; and- facilitate the subsequent  proportional share consolidation of Naspers N Ordinary Shares and Naspers A Ordinary Shares to reduce the large number of Naspers N Ordinary Shares and Naspers A Ordinary Shares in issue as a result of the Naspers Capitalisation Issue;Prosus will sell its resultant minimal holding of Naspers N Ordinary Shares into the market pursuant to which the Cross-Holding Structure will be removed. Subsequently  the Cross-Holding Agreement will be terminated in accordance with its existing terms.Post-implementation of the Proposed Transaction the Prosus Free-Float Shareholders will  in aggregate  directly hold c. 57% of the issued Prosus Ordinary Shares N  and Naspers will directly hold c. 43% of the issued Prosus Ordinary Shares N (both aligned with the existing respective effective economic interests).Application will be made for the Naspers N Ordinary Shares and Prosus Ordinary Shares N proposed to be issued on implementation of the Proposed Transaction to be admitted to listing and trading on Euronext Amsterdam and on the Main Board of the JSE and A2X Markets  as applicable.As the tax position of the Group will remain the same following the implementation of the Proposed Transaction  the costs for the Group to implement the Proposed Transaction are not expected to be significant and pertain to advisory fees.The Proposed Transaction will also be subject to the requisite regulatory approvals customary for the implementation of a transaction of this nature  other than the approval required for the implementation of the Proposed Transaction from the South African Reserve Bank which has already been obtained.The full terms of the Proposed Transaction will be detailed in the requisite documents to be published by Prosus and Naspers in due course in order to obtain the requisite approvals of the Prosus and Naspers Shareholders  respectively.The Proposed Transaction is expected to be implemented in Q3 of 2023.4.THE GROUP'S VOTING AND TAX POSITIONSNaspers's voting interest and control of Prosus is determined by the total voting rights that Naspers has in Prosus pursuant to the Prosus Ordinary Shares N and the Prosus Ordinary Shares B that Naspers holds.The current structure of the Prosus Ordinary Shares B will remain in place following the implementation of the Proposed Transaction and Naspers will retain control of Prosus with a c. 72% voting interest pursuant to the Prosus Capitalisation Issue.Naspers will remain tax resident and domiciled in South Africa and Prosus will remain tax resident and domiciled in the Netherlands. Furthermore  Prosus's tax status in South Africa will remain unchanged. Prosus will continue to be controlled by Naspers  form part of the same group of companies as Naspers  and Prosus and its subsidiaries will remain Controlled Foreign Companies (CFC) of Naspers.5.SHAREHOLDER CONFERENCE CALLShareholders are advised that today Naspers and Prosus have made available a presentation on the Group's audited financial results for the year ended 31 March 2023  which presentation includes information on the Proposed Transaction (the ResultsPresentation)  which can be accessed by shareholders at www.naspers.com or www.prosus.com.

They therefore provide an extraordinary tool for studying the appetites of collectors and revealing what our contemporaries value the mo st‚Äù.The triumph of Pop ArtIn 1964  Andy Warhol  Roy Lichtenstein  Robert Rauschenberg  and Ed Ruscha were at the peak of their careers and these four artists all have auction price records for works created that year  in the midst of the Cold War  just a few months after the assassination of President J.F. Kennedy. These records  to which must be added more than thirteen thousand other auction results for artworks made that year  make 1964 the year-of-creation that generated the greatest volume of auction turnover in the period 2000 to 2023 (twenty-two years)  all creative periods combined: $2.48 billion.Having fetched the second best art auction result of all time at $195 million on 9 May 2022 at Christie's in New York  Andy Warhol's Shot sage blue Marilyn (1964) is now a sort of figurehead for that year (1964). Although from a market perspective the previous two years were just as important for Warhol  1964 is also remembered in the art world for another reason: in 1964 Robert Rauschenberg won the Grand Prize at the Venice Biennale. Indeed  promoted by Leo Castelli (and perhaps even supported by the CIA)  in 1964 Pop Art imposed itself in the art world thereby consolidating a significant shift of art (and the art market) to the West‚Ä¶ a transfer of power from Paris to New York on the international scene. The way this transfer came about has been the subject of intense discussion.Top 15 auction prices for artworks produced in 1964[ https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/06/image2-1964-artmarket-com-top-15-auction-prices-artworks-produced-in-1964.png ]Abstraction  Pop Art and ExpressionismIn the mid-1960s  several major artists of the first half of the 20th century were still creating important works. Pablo Picasso  Alberto Giacometti  and Ren√© Magritte were still active. In Asia  Li Keran and Fu Baoshi were perpetuating the art of traditional Chinese painting by giving it very personal touches of modernity  while in Europe Zao Wou-Ki and some of his compatriots were exploring Lyrical Abstraction. In England  a new generation was making its mark: David Hockney was 27 in 1964  Frank Auerbach was 33 and Lucien Freud was 42. They were just at the beginning of their careers  but that year Francis Bacon  aged 55  painted some of his best portraits.In the United States  Mark Rothko  Barnett Newman  Willem De Kooning  and Clyfford Still were still exploring Abstract Expressionism and Jackson Pollock had passed away a few year back  while a new artistic revolution was emerging: Pop Art. It was this movement that truly imposed America on the international art scene and the international art market. The works themselves were often brilliant and eye-catching but they also often contained covert or less-covert criticism of the American dream. In France  Pierre Soulages has already painted his best canvases  but a new Expressionist scene was beginning to emerge in Germany  with Gerhard Richter and Sigmar Polke  Georg Baselitz  and Anselm Kiefer  among others. Their work unfolded over many years and therefore did not produce the same concentration of market value as the American Pop Art movement.The success of this movement was notably due to a relatively small number of series of works on which collectors focused heavily  and these series were created by the great names of American Pop Art and were generally worked and reworked for a few years... around 1964.SourcesArt Basel may be busy  but cautious sales reflect a complex market picture  Amy Shaw  The Art Newspaper  le 15 June 2023.https://www.theartnewspaper.com/2023/06/15/art-basel-may-be-busy-but-cautious-sales-reflect-a-complex-market-picture1964: P op A rt arrives in Europe  a betrayal as seen from France  Thomas Sn√©garoff  France Info  2 October 2015.https://www.francetvinfo.fr/replay-radio/histoires-d-info/1964-le-pop-art-debarque-en-europe-une-trahison-vue-de-france_1788541.htmlMarket analysis of works created by the Warhol-Basquiat duo exhibited at the Louis Vuitton Foundation  Artprice  25 April 2023https://www.artprice.com/artmarketinsight/works-co-signed-by-jean-michel-basquiat-and-andy-warhol-are-currently-showing-at-the-fondation-louis-vuitton-in-parisImages:[ https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/06/image1-1964-artmarket-com-auction-turnover-by-year-of-creation-in-painting.png ][ https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/06/image2-1964-artmarket-com-top-15-auction-prices-artworks-produced-in-1964.png ]Copyright 1987-2023 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to c ontact our E conometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: econometrics@artprice.comTry our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demoSubscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

People living with gMG often face treatment options that are broad-acting  and that have traditionally only offered symptomatic relief""   explained Professor Vera Bril  Professor of Medicine (Neurology)  University of Toronto  Director of the Neuromuscular Section  Division of Neurology  University of Toronto and University Health Network  Toronto  and lead investigator of the MycarinG study.""There is a significant need for new  innovative treatment options to reduce the day-to-day burden of gMG. Rozanolixizumab-noli is a new treatment option  targeting one of the mechanisms of disease to provide symptom improvement in patient-and physician reported outcomes at day 43.""gMG is a rare  chronic  heterogeneous (phenotypic and pathogenic)  unpredictable autoimmune disease characterized by dysfunction and damage at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ).4 5 6 Several factors are understood to be drivers of gMG disease pathology  including complement-cascade  immune cells and pathogenic IgG autoantibodies. Pathogenic IgG autoantibodies can impair synaptic transmission at the NMJ by targeting specific proteins on the post-synaptic membrane4 7 This disrupts the ability of the nerves to stimulate the muscle and results in a weaker contraction.4 gMG has a global prevalence of 100-350 cases per every 1 million people.5""No two people living with gMG experience the disease in the same way  so we can't take a 'one size fits all' approach to disease management "" said Iris Loew-Friedrich  Executive Vice-President and Chief Medical Officer at UCB. ""Disease management should be based on the clinical needs and preferences of the individual patient  and the aim of treatment is to help restore that patient's ability to carry out activities of daily living. The approval of rozanolixizumab-noli means doctors have an additional approved treatment option for their gMG patients who have not yet found a treatment that meets their needs.""The FDA approval1 is supported by safety and efficacy data from the pivotal Phase 3 MycarinG study (NCT03971422)  published in The Lancet Neurology in May 2023.1 The primary efficacy endpoint was the comparison of the change from baseline between treatment groups in the MG-ADL total score at day 43. MG-ADL is a measurement tool which assesses the impact of gMG on daily functions of 8 signs or symptoms that are typically affected in gMG. These include activities such as breathing  talking  swallowing  and being able to rise from a chair3. Each item is assessed on a 4-point scale where a score of 0 represents normal function and a score of 3 represents loss of ability to perform that function. A total score ranges from 0 to 24  with the higher scores indicating more impairment. A statistically significant difference favoring rozanolixizumab-noli was observed in the MG-ADL total score change from baseline [-3.4 points in rozanolixizumab-noli-treated group at either dose vs -0.8 points in the placebo-treated group (p<0.001)].The secondary endpoint was the change between treatment groups from baseline to day 43 in the QMG. The QMG is a 13-item categorical grading system that assesses muscle weakness. Each item is assessed on a 4-point scale where a score of 0 represents no weakness and a score of 3 represents severe weakness. A total possible score ranges from 0 to 39  where higher scores indicate more severe impairment. A statistically significant difference favoring rozanolixizumab-noli was observed in the QMG total score change from baseline [-5.4 points and -6.7 points in rozanolixizumab-noli-treated group at ‚âà7mg/kg and ‚âà10 mg/kg dose level  respectively  vs -1.9 points in the placebo-treated group (p<0.001)].The most common adverse reactions (reported in at least 10% of patients treated with in rozanolixizumab-noli) were headache  infections  diarrhea  pyrexia  hypersensitivity reactions  and nausea.1""We want to thank UCB for their continued commitment to the MG community to bring a new FDA-approved treatment option for generalized myasthenia gravis to patients and their treating physicians "" said Samantha Masterson  President and Chief Executive Officer of the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA). ""People living with generalized myasthenia gravis continue to experience significant unmet medical needs  this means expanding the number of FDA-approved treatment options is particularly important to treat this chronic  autoimmune  neuromuscular disease.""Rozanolixizumab-noli will be commercially available in the U.S. during the 3rd quarter of 2023.""Building on our decades of experience in neurology and immunology  we are proud to support the MG community with solutions to help improve patient lives  including a new FDA-approved treatment  education and support""  continued Iris Loew-Friedrich. The approval following priority review of rozanolixizumab-noli is a testament to this medicine's potential as a generally well-tolerated treatment option that is targeted to the individual needs of patients. We are so grateful to the patients  care partners  and investigators who participated in the MycarinG study  and to our employees and collaborators  whose dedication and commitment to the MG community made this important milestone possible.""The FDA reviewed rozanolixizumab-noli under Priority Review. Rozanolixizumab is also currently under review by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) for the treatment of adults with gMG. In 2019  the U.S. FDA granted orphan drug designation to rozanolixizumab-noli for the treatment of generalized myasthenia gravis.8 Orphan designation was granted by the European Commission in April 2020 to rozanolixizumab for the treatment of generalized myasthenia gravis.9 The PMDA granted similar orphan status to rozanolixizumab in Japan in November.10 Responses from regulatory agencies to these submissions are expected by H1 2024.About Generalized Myasthenia Gravis (gMG)gMG is a rare disease with a global prevalence of 100-350 cases per every 1 million people.5 People living with gMG can experience a variety of symptoms  including severe muscular weakness that can result in life-threatening weakness of the muscles of respiration  double vision  drooping eyelids  and difficulty swallowing  chewing and talking.11 12In gMG  pathogenic autoantibodies can impair synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) by targeting specific proteins on the post-synaptic membrane.3 4 This disrupts the ability of the nerves to stimulate the muscle and results in a weaker contraction. gMG can occur in any race  gender or age.13About the MycarinG study2The MycarinG study (NCT03971422) is a multi-center  Phase 3  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled study evaluating the efficacy and safety of rozanolixizumab in adult patients with gMG  with an open-label extension.The primary endpoint for the MycarinG study is change in the Myasthenia Gravis-Activities of Daily Living Profile (MG-ADL) score  an eight-item patient-reported scale developed to assess MG symptoms and their effects on daily activities. Additional endpoints include response rates  changes in the Myasthenia Gravis composite (MGC) score  the Quantitative MG (QMG) score  patient-reported outcomes at day 43 and adverse events (AEs). The majority of patients taking part in the MycarinG study opted to enroll in any future extensions to this clinical trial. As a result  UCB is exploring the potential for further extension studies into this treatment.For more information about the trial  visit https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/showithNCT03971422.About rozanolixizumabRozanolixizumab is a subcutaneous administered  humanized monoclonal antibody that specifically binds  with high affinity  to human neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). It has been designed to block the interaction of FcRn and Immunoglobulin G (IgG)  accelerating the catabolism of antibodies and reducing the concentration of pathogenic IgG autoantibodies.2Outside of the U.S. rozanolixizumab is not approved for use in any indication by any other regulatory authority worldwide.*In the U.S.  the International Nonproprietary Name (INN) for rozanolixizumab is 'rozanolixizumab-noli' following the FDA's 'Non-proprietary Naming of Biological Products Guidance'. This guidance advises that the nonproprietary name designated for originator biological products should be a proper name that is a combination of the core name and a distinguishing suffix that is devoid of meaning and composed of four lowercase letters.Important Safety Information for RYSTIGGO¬ÆWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSInfections: RYSTIGGO may increase the risk of infection. Delay RYSTIGGO administration in patients with an active infection until the infection is resolved. During treatment with RYSTIGGO  monitor for clinical signs and symptoms of infection. If serious infection occurs  administer appropriate treatment and consider withholding RYSTIGGO until the infection has resolved.ImmunizationImmunization with vaccines during RYSTIGGO treatment has not been studied. The safety of immunization with live or live-attenuated vaccines and the response to immunization with any vaccine are unknown. Because RYSTIGGO causes a reduction in IgG levels  vaccination with live-attenuated or live vaccines is not recommended during treatment with RYSTIGGO. Evaluate the need to administer age-appropriate vaccines according to immunization guidelines before initiation of a new treatment cycle with RYSTIGGO.Aseptic Meningitis: Serious adverse reactions of aseptic meningitis (also called drug-induced aseptic meningitis) have been reported in patients treated with RYSTIGGO. If symptoms consistent with aseptic meningitis develop  diagnostic workup and treatment should be initiated according to the standard of care.Hypersensitivity Reactions: Hypersensitivity reactions  including angioedema and rash  were observed in patients treated with RYSTIGGO. Management of hypersensitivity reactions depends on the type and severity of the reaction. Monitor patients during treatment with RYSTIGGO and for 15 minutes after for clinical signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions. If a reaction occurs  institute appropriate measures if needed.ADVERSE REACTIONSIn a placebo-controlled study  the most common adverse reactions (reported in at least 10% of RYSTIGGO-treated patients) were headache  infections  diarrhea  pyrexia  hypersensitivity reactions  and nausea. Serious infections were reported in 4% of patients treated with RYSTIGGO. Three fatal cases of pneumonia were identified  caused by COVID-19 infection in two patients and an unknown pathogen in one patient. Six cases of infections led to discontinuation of RYSTIGGO.The full Prescribing Information will be available at https://www.ucb-usa.com/RYSTIGGO-prescribing-information.pdfFor further information  contact UCB:Global Rare Disease CommunicationsJim BaxterT+32.2.473.78.85.01jim.baxter@ucb.comUS Rare Disease CommunicationsDaphe TeoDaphne.teo@ucb.com+1-770-880-7655Corporate Communications  Media RelationsLaurent SchotsT+32.2.559.92.64Laurent.schots@ucb.comInvestor RelationsAntje WitteT +32.2.559.94.14antje.witte@ucb.comAbout UCBUCB  Brussels  Belgium (www.ucb.com) is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of innovative medicines and solutions to transform the lives of people living with severe diseases of the immune system or of the central nervous system.

The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products  which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB's efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover  sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment  including pricing pressure  political and public scrutiny  customer and prescriber patterns or practices  and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes. Finally  a breakdown  cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality  integrity and availability of UCB's data and systems.Given these uncertainties  you should not place undue reliance on any of such forward-looking statements. There can be no guarantee that the investigational or approved products described in this press release will be submitted or approved for sale or for any additional indications or labelling in any market  or at any particular time  nor can there be any guarantee that such products will be or will continue to be commercially successful in the future.UCB is providing this information  including forward-looking statements  only as of the date of this press release and it does not reflect any potential impact from the evolving COVID-19 pandemic  unless indicated otherwise.

People living with gMG often face treatment options that are broad-acting  and that have traditionally only offered symptomatic relief "" explained Professor Vera Bril  Professor of Medicine (Neurology)  University of Toronto  Director of the Neuromuscular Section  Division of Neurology  University of Toronto and University Health Network  Toronto  and lead investigator of the MycarinG study.""There is a significant need for new  innovative treatment options to reduce the day-to-day burden of gMG. RYSTIGGO ¬Æ is a new treatment option  targeting one of the mechanisms of disease to provide symptom improvement in patient-and physician reported outcomes at day 43.""gMG is a rare  chronic  heterogeneous (phenotypic and pathogenic)  unpredictable autoimmune disease characterized by dysfunction and damage at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ).4 5 6 Several factors are understood to be drivers of gMG disease pathology  including complement-cascade  immune cells and pathogenic IgG autoantibodies. Pathogenic IgG autoantibodies can impair synaptic transmission at the NMJ by targeting specific proteins on the post-synaptic membrane.4 7 This disrupts the ability of the nerves to stimulate the muscle and results in a weaker contraction.4 gMG has a global prevalence of 100‚Äì350 cases per every 1 million people.5""No two people living with gMG experience the disease in the same way  so we can't take a 'one size fits all' approach to disease management "" said Iris Loew-Friedrich  Executive Vice-President and Chief Medical Officer at UCB. ""Disease management should be based on the clinical needs and preferences of the individual patient  and the aim of treatment is to help restore that patient's ability to carry out activities of daily living. The approval of RYSTIGGO¬Æ means doctors have an additional approved treatment option for their gMG patients who have not yet found a treatment that meets their needs.""The FDA approval1 is supported by safety and efficacy data from the pivotal Phase 3 MycarinG study (NCT03971422)  published in The Lancet Neurology in May 2023.2 The primary efficacy endpoint was the comparison of the change from baseline between treatment groups in the MG-ADL total score at day 43. MG-ADL is a measurement tool which assesses the impact of gMG on daily functions of 8 signs or symptoms that are typically affected in gMG. These include activities such as breathing  talking  swallowing  and being able to rise from a chair3. Each item is assessed on a 4-point scale where a score of 0 represents normal function and a score of 3 represents loss of ability to perform that function. A total score ranges from 0 to 24  with the higher scores indicating more impairment. A statistically significant difference favoring RYSTIGGO was observed in the MG-ADL total score change from baseline [-3.4 points in RYSTIGGO-treated group at either dose vs -0.8 points in the placebo-treated group (p<0.001)].The secondary endpoint was the change between treatment groups from baseline to day 43 in the QMG. The QMG is a 13-item categorical grading system that assesses muscle weakness. Each item is assessed on a 4-point scale where a score of 0 represents no weakness and a score of 3 represents severe weakness. A total possible score ranges from 0 to 39  where higher scores indicate more severe impairment. A statistically significant difference favoring RYSTIGGO was observed in the QMG total score change from baseline [-5.4 points and -6.7 points in RYSTIGGO-treated group at ‚âà7mg/kg and ‚âà10 mg/kg dose level  respectively  vs -1.9 points in the placebo-treated group (p<0.001)].The most common adverse reactions (reported in at least 10% of patients treated with RYSTIGGO) were headache  infections  diarrhea  pyrexia  hypersensitivity reactions  and nausea.1""We want to thank UCB for their continued commitment to the MG community to bring a new FDA-approved treatment option for generalized myasthenia gravis to patients and their treating physicians "" said Samantha Masterson  President and Chief Executive Officer of the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA). ""People living with generalized myasthenia gravis continue to experience significant unmet medical needs  this means expanding the number of FDA-approved treatment options is particularly important to treat this chronic  autoimmune  neuromuscular disease.""RYSTIGGO¬Æ will be commercially available in the U.S. during the 3rd quarter of 2023.""Building on our decades of experience in neurology and immunology  we are proud to support the MG community with solutions to help improve patient lives  including a new FDA-approved treatment  education and support""  continued Iris Loew-Friedrich.""The approval following priority review of RYSTIGGO¬Æ is a testament to this medicine's potential as a generally well-tolerated treatment option that is targeted to the individual needs of patients. We are so grateful to the patients  care partners  and investigators who participated in the MycarinG study  and to our employees and collaborators  whose dedication and commitment to the MG community made this important milestone possible.""The FDA reviewed RYSTIGGO¬Æ under Priority Review. RYSTIGGO¬Æ is also currently under review by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) for the treatment of adults with gMG. In 2019  the U.S. FDA granted orphan drug designation to RYSTIGGO¬Æ for the treatment of generalized myasthenia gravis.8 Orphan designation was granted by the European Commission in April 2020 to RYSTIGGO¬Æ for the treatment of generalized myasthenia gravis.9 The PMDA granted similar orphan status to RYSTIGGO¬Æ in Japan in November.10 Responses from regulatory agencies to these submissions are expected by H1 2024.About Generalized Myasthenia Gravis (gMG)gMG is a rare disease with a global prevalence of 100‚Äì350 cases per every 1 million people.5 People living with gMG can experience a variety of symptoms  including severe muscular weakness that can result in life-threatening weakness of the muscles of respiration  double vision  drooping eyelids  and difficulty swallowing  chewing and talking.11 12In gMG  pathogenic autoantibodies can impair synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) by targeting specific proteins on the post-synaptic membrane.3 4 This disrupts the ability of the nerves to stimulate the muscle and results in a weaker contraction. gMG can occur in any race  gender or age.13About the MycarinGstudy2The MycarinG study (NCT03971422) is a multi-center  Phase 3  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled study evaluating the efficacy and safety of rozanolixizumab in adult patients with gMG  with an open-label extension.The primary endpoint for the MycarinG study is change in the Myasthenia Gravis-Activities of Daily Living Profile (MG-ADL) score  an eight-item patient-reported scale developed to assess MG symptoms and their effects on daily activities. Additional endpoints include response rates  changes in the Myasthenia Gravis composite (MGC) score  the Quantitative MG (QMG) score  patient-reported outcomes at day 43 and adverse events (AEs). The majority of patients taking part in the MycarinG study opted to enroll in any future extensions to this clinical trial. As a result  UCB is exploring the potential for further extension studies into this treatment.For more information about the trial  visit https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/showithNCT03971422.About RYSTIGGO¬ÆRYSTIGGO¬Æ is a subcutaneous administered  humanized monoclonal antibody that specifically binds  with high affinity  to human neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). It has been designed to block the interaction of FcRn and Immunoglobulin G (IgG)  accelerating the catabolism of antibodies and reducing the concentration of pathogenic IgG autoantibodies.2Important Safety Information for RYSTIGGO¬ÆWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSInfections: RYSTIGGO may increase the risk of infection. Delay RYSTIGGO administration in patients with an active infection until the infection is resolved. During treatment with RYSTIGGO  monitor for clinical signs and symptoms of infection. If serious infection occurs  administer appropriate treatment and consider withholding RYSTIGGO until the infection has resolved.ImmunizationImmunization with vaccines during RYSTIGGO treatment has not been studied. The safety of immunization with live or live-attenuated vaccines and the response to immunization with any vaccine are unknown. Because RYSTIGGO causes a reduction in IgG levels  vaccination with live-attenuated or live vaccines is not recommended during treatment with RYSTIGGO. Evaluate the need to administer age-appropriate vaccines according to immunization guidelines before initiation of a new treatment cycle with RYSTIGGO.Aseptic Meningitis: Serious adverse reactions of aseptic meningitis (also called drug-induced aseptic meningitis) have been reported in patients treated with RYSTIGGO. If symptoms consistent with aseptic meningitis develop  diagnostic workup and treatment should be initiated according to the standard of care.Hypersensitivity Reactions: Hypersensitivity reactions  including angioedema and rash  were observed in patients treated with RYSTIGGO. Management of hypersensitivity reactions depends on the type and severity of the reaction. Monitor patients during treatment with RYSTIGGO and for 15 minutes after for clinical signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions. If a reaction occurs  institute appropriate measures if needed.ADVERSE REACTIONSIn a placebo-controlled study  the most common adverse reactions (reported in at least 10% of RYSTIGGO-treated patients) were headache  infections  diarrhea  pyrexia  hypersensitivity reactions  and nausea. Serious infections were reported in 4% of patients treated with RYSTIGGO. Three fatal cases of pneumonia were identified  caused by COVID-19 infection in two patients and an unknown pathogen in one patient. Six cases of infections led to discontinuation of RYSTIGGO.Please refer to the full Prescribing Information.For further information  contact UCB:U.S. Rare Disease CommunicationsDaphne TeoT+1-770-880-7655Daphne.teo@ucb.comGlobal Rare Disease CommunicationsJim BaxterT+32.2.473.78.85.01Jim.baxter@ucb.comCorporate Communications  Media RelationsLaurent SchotsT+32.2.559.92.64Laurent.schots@ucb.comInvestor RelationsAntje WitteT +32.2.559.94.14Antje.witte@ucb.comAbout UCBUCB  Brussels  Belgium (www.ucb.com) is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of innovative medicines and solutions to transform the lives of people living with severe diseases of the immune system or of the central nervous system.

This followed the positive evaluation of the proposal submitted by the partners in response to the call for proposals issued by the Clean Hydrogen Partnership  co-founded and co-financed by the European Union.The consortium aims to pave the way for the deployment of large-scale offshore production of renewable hydrogen. The HOPE project involves developing  building and operating the first 10 MW production unit in the North Sea  off the coast of Belgium  by 2026. The aim is to demonstrate the technical and financial viability of this offshore project  and of pipeline transport for supplying onshore customers.HOPE Takes Offshore Hydrogen Production to Industrial ScaleLhyfe completed a first step in 2022 with a world first ‚Äì the inauguration of Sealhyfe  the world's first pilot production plant for offshore hydrogen already integrating Plug's technology and powered by a 1 MW floating wind turbine.With HOPE  the consortium partners are moving up a gear and aiming for commercialisation. This unprecedentedly large-scale project (10 MW) will be able to produce up to four tonnes a day of green hydrogen at sea  which will be exported to shore by composite pipeline  compressed and delivered to customers for use in industry and the transport sector. HOPE is the first offshore project of this size in the world to begin actual implementation  with the production unit and export and distribution infrastructure due to come on stream in mid-2026.HOPE will benefit from an ideal location  one kilometre from the coast  in the offshore testing area in front of the port of Ostend (Belgium)  which aims to be the central link in the hydrogen chain in Belgium and has contributed to the development of the project since its inception.The production site will be powered by electricity supplied under PPA (Power Purchase Agreement) contracts that guarantee its renewable origin. The water used for electrolysis will be pumped from the North Sea  desalinated and purified.The production site will comprise three units: production and compression (at medium pressure) at sea  export by composite pipeline  then compression (at high pressure)  storage and distribution onshore.The first kilos of HOPE hydrogen could be produced as early as 2026. They will supply mobility needs and small industries in Belgium  northern France and the southern Netherlands  within a 300-kilometre radius.A Flagship Project for the European Commission and the Clean Hydrogen PartnershipThis project has been selected for funding under the Clean Hydrogen Partnership call for proposals co-financed by the European Union. HOPE is thus recognised as a flagship project making a decisive contribution to energy transition. By means of a first large-scale demonstration  the project will make it possible to improve the technological solutions for the production of renewable hydrogen offshore and its export onshore  helping to reduce the investment risks for much larger-scale projects in the years to come and paving the way for the production of massive quantities of renewable hydrogen in Europe.The grant awarded by the European Commission covers a period of five years. This includes three years to develop the demonstrator  and then two years to demonstrate the technical reliability and commercial viability of the model. The commercial operation of the hydrogen production  export and distribution infrastructures developed in this context is intended to continue beyond the duration of the project.The ‚Ç¨20 million grant will be used to finance the design phases  the supply of equipment and the construction work  as well as research  development and innovation work focusing mainly on optimising technological solutions and the operation of this type of infrastructure. The techno-economic analysis of offshore renewable hydrogen production solutions on a much larger scale will be another of the areas of work.Thanks to an ambitious plan to disseminate and utilise the results  the consortium intends to accelerate the deployment of large-scale offshore hydrogen solutions to help achieve the target set by the European Commission of 10 Mt of clean hydrogen produced in the European Union by 2030 to decarbonise the European economy.First-Rate Partners for a Series of Technological InnovationsHOPE will combine the expertise and know-how of each of the nine partners involved  covering the entire renewable hydrogen value chain.Main Key Innovations to be Developed in the ProjectRecycled offshore barge: The structure housing the production unit will be a second-hand jack-up barge  demonstrating that it is possible to transform infrastructure previously used for oil and gas and give it a second life for the production of renewable energy  while helping to reduce costs and lead times.The structure housing the production unit will be a second-hand jack-up barge  demonstrating that it is possible to transform infrastructure previously used for oil and gas and give it a second life for the production of renewable energy  while helping to reduce costs and lead times. 10 MW PEM electrolyser: This highly compact electrolyser will be the first of its size to be installed offshore.This highly compact electrolyser will be the first of its size to be installed offshore.

This trend thus confirms the momentum already recorded in the second half of the previous financial year.Therefore  after taking into account several scope effects2 over the period  Gross Gaming Revenue (GGR) came out with an increase of +17.6% to ‚Ç¨ 341.0 M and turnover increased by +15.2% to ‚Ç¨ 215.6 M.The Group‚Äôs EBITDA was up by + 24.6% at ‚Ç¨ 42.7 M (i.e. 19.8% of turnover) compared to ‚Ç¨ 34.2 M (18.3% of turnover) at 1st HY 2022.The current operating income (COI) doubles at ‚Ç¨ 19.3 M  compared to ‚Ç¨ 9.7 M a year earlier driven by the renewed dynamism in the casino sector whose COI reached ‚Ç¨ 27.0 M  compared to ‚Ç¨ 16.0 M at 1st HY 2022 (+ 69.2%) and especially due to:the improvement in COI at the Pasino of Aix-en-Provence   which experienced its first normal half-year of activity since the end of the renovation works carried on in April 2019 (COI up to + ‚Ç¨ 2.1 M)   which experienced its first normal half-year of activity since the end of the renovation works carried on in April 2019 (COI up to + ‚Ç¨ 2.1 M)  the excellent performance of online gaming in Switzerland  whose COI is now close to equilibrium barely two years after its deployment (COI at - ‚Ç¨ 0.05 M in 2023 compared to - ‚Ç¨ 3.5 M in 2022).These trends make the Group confident in the strategy of ramping up the Middelkerke casino integrated in July 2022 (COI loss of ‚Ç¨ 2.5 M at this stage) from which the Group will launch  subject to the official obtaining of the required license  an online gaming activity in Belgium in partnership with the Betsson AB Group3.At the same time  the COI of the hotels sector is in deficit by - ‚Ç¨ 2.3 M in the 1st HY 2023  against - ‚Ç¨ 1.8 m in 1st HY 2022  as well as the sector ""Other"" at - ‚Ç¨ 5.4 M  against - ‚Ç¨ 4.6 M.Purchases & external expenses increase by ‚Ç¨ 10.0 M (+16.5%) reaching ‚Ç¨ 70.7 M  with particularly:an increase of ‚Ç¨ 4.4 M (+ 24.4%) of the purchase of materials  nearly half of which (‚Ç¨ 1.9 M) is mainly due to the rise in energy prices;an increase in advertising/marketing expenses of ‚Ç¨ 2.7 M (+23.8%) and fees of ‚Ç¨ 0.9 M (+8.4%) correlated with the dynamism of the activity and the marketing operations for the 50 th anniversary of Groupe Partouche (in particular through the operations of free allocation of gaming ""promotion credits""  increasing by ‚Ç¨ 2.3 M);anniversary of Groupe Partouche (in particular through the operations of free allocation of gaming ""promotion credits""  increasing by ‚Ç¨ 2.3 M); a decrease of ‚Ç¨ 2.0 M (-32.0%) in advertising and marketing fees expenses related to the online gaming activity of the Meyrin casino.Employees expenses reached ‚Ç¨ 87.4 M  up by ‚Ç¨ 5.5 M due to the increase in activity and employees (+ 2.8%)Net income is a profit of ‚Ç¨ 18.8M compared to ‚Ç¨ 24.6 M at 30th April 2022. As a reminder  the latter benefited from a non-current operating income of ‚Ç¨ 17.5 M linked to the sale of the stake in the Swiss Crans-Montana casino for ‚Ç¨ 14.1 M and the resolution of old disputes against the Belgian State for ‚Ç¨ 3.4 M.The net income at 1st HY 2023 takes into account the following items:a non-current operating income of ‚Ç¨ 0.7 M composed of the progress margin on the property development contract in La Grande Motte for ‚Ç¨ 0.2 M and the income from the disposal of two non-operational property assets in Contrex√©ville for ‚Ç¨ 0.5 M a financial income of - ‚Ç¨ 1.5 M (compared to - ‚Ç¨ 1.3 M in 1HY 2022). The cost of financial debt is up despite the decline in the Group's gross debt  which is offset by the rapid rise in interest rates. In addition  the loan interest expenses includes IFRS 16 rents from Middelkerke for ‚Ç¨ 0.6 M. Conversely  the Group benefited from an increase in income from financial investments (+ ‚Ç¨ 0.5 M)  greater than the increase in the debt‚Äôs cost a tax income (CVAE included) of + ‚Ç¨ 0.3 M (compared to - ‚Ç¨ 1.2 M in 1st HY 2022). This item takes into account the activation of the balance of the tax loss carryforwards of the tax consolidation group  given the good performance achieved and the business outlook  which generated deferred tax income of ‚Ç¨ 3.6 M over the period.The financial structure of the Group is extremely healthy and solid considering the cashflow after levies of ‚Ç¨ 127.8 M  equity of ‚Ç¨ 369.0 M and a net debt of ‚Ç¨ 38.6 M (constructed in accordance with the terms of the syndicated loan agreement  according to the old IAS 17 standard  excluding IFRS 16)New growth investmentsThe Group's financial situation allows it to pursue the restructuring of its establishments.Thus  the casino at DIVONNE has undertaken its renovation in order to regain its former splendor with magnified volumes and significant heights. The works began with a major cleaning  now completed  which made it possible to update the semicircular arches and to reopen a multitude of interior bays that will make this casino a fluid  modern and completely renewed space: new gaming rooms  new bar  new restaurant  new atmosphere while preserving the spirit of the place.The casino at VICHY has also initiated in June 2023  a restructuring  with an enlarged gaming room by the creation of a floor allocated to games and a complete renovation of the restaurant  bar and entrance hall areas.Upcoming events:- 3rd quarter financial information: Tuesday 12th September 2023  following Paris stock market closure.- 4th quarter turnover: Tuesday 12th December 2023  following Paris stock market closure.Groupe Partouche was established in 1973 and has grown to become one of the market leaders in Europe in its business sector.

In an interview with journalist Amy Shaw for the Art Newspaper at Art Basel  art dealer Dominique L√©vy said he detects the presence of a ""clear correction"". Artprice takes this opportunity to review the acceleration of the art market since the beginning of the 21st century  via a quick look at the works that the market values the most.Auction turnover (2000-2022) by year of creation in painting Top 15 auction prices for artworks produced in 1964Auction turnover (2000-2022) by year of creation in paintingPhoto - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2141769/year_of_creation_in_painting.jpg""The analysis of auctions results is a fascinating way to examine the evolution of Art History""  explains thierry Ehrmann  President of Artmarket.com and Founder of Artprice. ""Our databases  have collected objective and comprehensive Fine Art auction data for more than 30 years from all over the world. They therefore provide an extraordinary tool for studying the appetites of collectors and revealing what our contemporaries value the most"".The triumph of Pop ArtIn 1964  Andy Warhol  Roy Lichtenstein  Robert Rauschenberg  and Ed Ruscha were at the peak of their careers and these four artists all have auction price records for works created that year  in the midst of the Cold War  just a few months after the assassination of President J.F. Kennedy. These records  to which must be added more than thirteen thousand other auction results for artworks made that year  make 1964 the year-of-creation that generated the greatest volume of auction turnover in the period 2000 to 2023 (twenty-two years)  all creative periods combined: $2.48 billion.Having fetched the second best art auction result of all time at $195 million on 9 May 2022 at Christie's in New York  Andy Warhol's Shot sage blue Marilyn (1964) is now a sort of figurehead for that year (1964). Although from a market perspective the previous two years were just as important for Warhol  1964 is also remembered in the art world for another reason: in 1964 Robert Rauschenberg won the Grand Prize at the Venice Biennale. Indeed  promoted by Leo Castelli (and perhaps even supported by the CIA)  in 1964 Pop Art imposed itself in the art world thereby consolidating a significant shift of art (and the art market) to the West‚Ä¶ a transfer of power from Paris to New York on the international scene. The way this transfer came about has been the subject of intense discussion.Top 15 auction prices for artworks produced in 1964Photo - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2141770/artworks_produced_in_1964.jpgAbstraction  Pop Art and ExpressionismIn the mid-1960s  several major artists of the first half of the 20th century were still creating important works. Pablo Picasso  Alberto Giacometti  and Ren√© Magritte were still active. In Asia  Li Keran and Fu Baoshi were perpetuating the art of traditional Chinese painting by giving it very personal touches of modernity  while in Europe Zao Wou-Ki and some of his compatriots were exploring Lyrical Abstraction. In England  a new generation was making its mark: David Hockney was 27 in 1964  Frank Auerbach was 33 and Lucien Freud was 42. They were just at the beginning of their careers  but that year Francis Bacon  aged 55  painted some of his best portraits.In the United States  Mark Rothko  Barnett Newman  Willem De Kooning  and Clyfford Still were still exploring Abstract Expressionism and Jackson Pollock had passed away a few year back  while a new artistic revolution was emerging: Pop Art. It was this movement that truly imposed America on the international art scene and the international art market. The works themselves were often brilliant and eye-catching but they also often contained covert or less-covert criticism of the American dream. In France  Pierre Soulages has already painted his best canvases  but a new Expressionist scene was beginning to emerge in Germany  with Gerhard Richter and Sigmar Polke  Georg Baselitz  and Anselm Kiefer  among others. Their work unfolded over many years and therefore did not produce the same concentration of market value as the American Pop Art movement.The success of this movement was notably due to a relatively small number of series of works on which collectors focused heavily  and these series were created by the great names of American Pop Art and were generally worked and reworked for a few years... around 1964.SourcesArt Basel may be busy  but cautious sales reflect a complex market picture  Amy Shaw  The Art Newspaper  le 15 June 2023.https://www.theartnewspaper.com/2023/06/15/art-basel-may-be-busy-but-cautious-sales-reflect-a-complex-market-picture1964: Pop Art arrives in Europe  a betrayal as seen from France  Thomas Sn√©garoff  France Info  2 October 2015.https://www.francetvinfo.fr/replay-radio/histoires-d-info/1964-le-pop-art-debarque-en-europe-une-trahison-vue-de-france_1788541.htmlMarket analysis of works created by the Warhol-Basquiat duo exhibited at the Louis Vuitton Foundation  Artprice  25 April 2023https://www.artprice.com/artmarketinsight/works-co-signed-by-jean-michel-basquiat-and-andy-warhol-are-currently-showing-at-the-fondation-louis-vuitton-in-parisImages:[https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/06/image1-1964-artmarket-com-auction-turnover-by-year-of-creation-in-painting.png][https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/06/image2-1964-artmarket-com-top-15-auction-prices-artw Roy Lichtenstein orks-produced-in-1964.png]Copyright 1987-2023 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to contact our Econometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: [email protected]for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: Try our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demo(free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demo Subscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

According to the study  kids who worry less about the environment do less about it  while higher levels of eco-anxiety drive increased eco-action. Overall  Earth Rangers found that children in the Northeast and West Coast over-indexed on both eco-anxiety and eco-action  the South hovered at the national average  while the Midwest under-indexed across the board.Developed in partnership with marketing research and public opinion research organization  Ipsos  Earth Rangers' 2023 Eco-Anxiety Index involved surveying 1000 children in the US between the ages of 6-11 years old. The results showed that more than 80 percent of respondents agreed with statements related to experiencing eco-anxiety  including feeling worried about animal extinction  climate change  and the future of our planet. Yet more than 65 percent agreed to statements about taking regular eco-action  including talking with friends and family  participating in rallies and events  volunteering  supporting environmental organizations  and participating in activities at home or school. Using these findings as the baseline  the study found that levels of eco-anxiety and eco-action rose and fell in different parts of the country  but always stayed consistent with one other."" Google Trends data shows a 60 percent jump in searches for eco-anxiety in the last year  yet the majority of the information being served up in response is overwhelmingly negative "" said Tovah Barocas  President of Earth Rangers. ""Our data shows just the opposite; that today's generation is leveraging their concerns as a catalyst for positive change. Instead of seeing a problem  they see a wake-up call - and aren't hesitating to do something about it. But this doesn't mean that adults are off the hook - it's just as important for parents and educators to engage with kids and help turn their concerns into positive action""The research also found that among populations who over-indexed  levels of eco-action actually outpaced levels of eco-anxiety - indicating that taking action for the environment has a positive effect  which is consistent with previous research Earth Rangers has done on the topic. Conversely  feelings of eco-anxiety overpower eco-action levels for children on the lower end of the index.""The findings of this study are especially impactful because it is one of the few pieces of research that point to eco-anxiety as empowering and motivating instead of a negative problem to solve "" said Steve Levy  Chief Client Officer at Ipsos Canada. ""To further reinforce this  we compared the survey results to the responses of over 600 Earth Rangers members and found that they also consistently over-indexed on all fronts. The data doesn't lie: the more you know about the environment  the more empowered you feel to take action on its behalf.""For more information on Earth Rangers or to check out the Earth Rangers App  visit https://www.earthrangers.com/EN/US/ .

The group owns the luxury yacht marques Riva  Pershing  Custom Line  Ferretti Yachts  Itama  and the custom superyacht brand CRN.The company celebrated the listing by positioning a Riva Anniversario outside the stock-exchange building in Milan‚Äôs Piazza Affari. Ferretti CEO Alberto Galassi said his company was ‚Äúthe first and only Group in the world‚Äîand not just in the luxury yacht industry‚Äîto achieve this double listing in Asia and Europe.‚ÄùOn June 21  Ferretti started taking stock orders from investors in anticipation of the listing. The company  which is controlled by Chinese conglomerate Weichai Group  sold 97 million existing shares  or about 28.7 percent of its share capital  to investors.Ferretti CEO Alberto Galassi in front of the Milan stock exchange following its listing on the Euronext Milan. Courtesy Ferretti GroupFerretti completed its initial public offering (IPO) in Hong Kong just over a year ago. In 2018  it attempted a similar IPO on the Milan exchange but had to scuttle it due to a lack of investor appetite.The dual listing is expected to provide growth capital moving forward as Ferretti continues to pursue an ambitious growth agenda that started shortly after Galassi became CEO in 2014. Its new launches were particularly strong during the pandemic: Ferretti grew the number of models across its different brands to 54 last year  up from 42 in 2021.Recent launches include the Custom Line Navetta 38  Pershing GTX116  Ferretti Yachts 580  wallypower58X  and Wallywhy150. It also presented the first model of its new InFYnito range  the InFYnito 90  last January.The interior of the Pershing GTX116  one of the group‚Äôs recent launches. Courtesy Pershing YachtsIn May  the company reported an order backlog of $1.64 billion (1.5 billion euros)  with an order intake of $337 million (or 307.5 million euros) for the first three months of the year. Ferretti said yacht orders rose 15.4 percent for its first quarter compared to the same period a year earlier  mostly on international orders.The group also plans to launch multiple boats this year at the Cannes and Monaco Yacht shows  though it has yet to release the specific models.,neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,mixed,0.62,0.05,0.33,True,English,"['Hong Kong Stock Exchanges', 'First Luxury Brand', 'Italian Yachtmaker', 'Milan', 'Chinese conglomerate Weichai Group', 'Ferretti CEO Alberto Galassi', 'Courtesy Ferretti Group Ferretti', '97 million existing shares', 'initial public offering', 'luxury yacht marques', 'luxury yacht industry', 'Monaco Yacht shows', 'custom superyacht brand', 'ambitious growth agenda', 'Milan-based stock exchange', 'Custom Line Navetta', 'first three months', 'Courtesy Pershing Yachts', 'Hong Kong exchange', 'The Ferretti Group', 'new InFYnito range', 'Milan stock exchange', 'Ferretti Yachts', 'Milan exchange', 'yacht orders', 'stock orders', 'growth capital', 'new launches', 'Euronext Milan', 'stock-exchange building', 'Piazza Affari', 'share capital', 'investor appetite', 'different brands', 'Recent launches', 'Pershing GTX11', 'first model', 'order backlog', '1.5 billion euros', 'order intake', 'first quarter', 'same period', 'international orders', 'multiple boats', 'current listing', 'Riva Anniversario', 'double listing', 'similar IPO', 'dual listing', 'specific models', 'Itama', 'CRN', 'company', 'world', 'Asia', 'Europe', 'June', 'investors', 'anticipation', '28.7 percent', 'front', 'lack', 'pandemic', 'number', 'Wallywhy150', 'interior', 'May', 'year', 'Cannes', '307.5']",2023-06-28,2023-06-28,robbreport.com
