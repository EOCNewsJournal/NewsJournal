Europe is trying to figure out how,Russian assets frozen in European accounts could generate billions of dollars a year for rebuilding Ukraine. But can that money be used without breaching international law or damaging the euro‚Äôs international standing?,By Hanna Ziady  CNNLondon (CNN) ‚Äî Russian assets frozen in European accounts could generate billions of dollars a year for rebuilding Ukraine. But can that money be used without breaching international law or damaging the euro‚Äôs international standing?European Union leaders are grappling with that question at a meeting in Brussels Thursday.The World Bank estimates Ukraine will need at least $411 billion to repair the damage caused by the war. And the EU and its allies are determined to make Russia foot part of the bill.One idea put forward in the EU is to draw off the interest on income generated by Russian assets while leaving the assets themselves untouched.This approach would probably deliver about ‚Ç¨3 billion ($3.3 billion) a year  according to Anders Ahnlid  the director general of the Swedish National Board of Trade and head of the EU working group looking into frozen Russian assets.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the best way of using these assets in accordance with EU and international law ‚Äù Ahnlid told CNN  noting that was also the view of lawyers at the European Commission  which has promised to propose a way to tap frozen Russian assets within weeks.But some EU member states  and the European Central Bank (ECB)  have concerns that it could shake confidence in the euro as the world‚Äôs second biggest reserve currency. The EU has been at pains to contrast the illegality of Russia‚Äôs invasion with its own strict adherence to the rule of law.‚ÄúWe have to respect the principles of international law ‚Äù said a senior EU diplomat  who requested anonymity because he is not authorized to discuss closed-door meetings. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a matter of reputation  of financial stability and trust.‚ÄùThe ECB declined to comment.How it would workAfter the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February last year  EU and Group of Seven countries imposed unprecedented sanctions on Russia  freezing nearly half of its foreign reserves ‚Äî some ‚Ç¨300 billion ($327 billion) ‚Äî among other measures.Around two-thirds of that  or ‚Ç¨200 billion ($218 billion)  sits in the EU  mostly in accounts at Belgium-based Euroclear  one of the world‚Äôs largest financial clearing houses.Euroclear plays a crucial role in global markets  settling cross-border trades and safekeeping more than $40 trillion in assets.The group said in April that cash on its balance sheet had more than doubled over the year to March to stand at ‚Ç¨140 billion ($153 billion)  boosted by payments associated with frozen Russian assets  including bonds.Ordinarily  these payments would have been made to Russian bank accounts  but they have been blocked as a result of sanctions and are now themselves generating vast amounts of interest.Euroclear routinely invests such long-term cash balances and  in the first quarter  it recorded ‚Ç¨734 million ($802 million) in interest earned on cash balances from sanctioned Russian assets.The plan proposed by the EU working group would involve using a special levy to collect the windfall interest income made by Euroclear from frozen Russian assets  which would then be paid into the EU budget for the reconstruction of Ukraine.Speaking on the sidelines of Thursday‚Äôs EU meeting  Latvia‚Äôs Prime Minister Arturs Kri≈°jƒÅnis Kari≈Ü≈° said frozen Russian assets were ‚Äúlow-hanging fruit.‚Äù‚ÄúWe need to find a legal basis to utilize  mobilize these assets to help‚Ä¶ pay for the damage Russia is causing in Ukraine ‚Äù he said.But one senior EU official warned of unintended consequences  such as causing other countries or investors to worry about the safety of their assets in Europe.‚ÄúThose who have money might think ‚Ä¶.‚Äôwhat if one day  I‚Äôm on the list ‚Äô‚Äù the official  who also requested anonymity because the discussions are private  said Wednesday.One way to reduce risks to the EU would be to coordinate action with the G7. ‚ÄúI think discussion at the G7 is quite key ‚Äù the official added.Ahnlid echoed this  noting that many EU member states had stressed the importance of the bloc taking steps ‚Äúin tandem with G7 partners.‚Äù‚Äî James Frater contributed reporting.The-CNN-Wire‚Ñ¢ & ¬© 2023 Cable News Network  Inc.  a Warner Bros.

REUTERS/Yves Herman/File Photo reuters_tickersThis content was published on June 29  2023 - 12:09By Jan StrupczewskiBRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union leaders will push senior officials on Thursday to find legal ways to funnel proceeds from billions of dollars of frozen Russian assets into projects helping rebuild Ukraine  papers showed.The bloc has said it froze more than 200 billion euros ($218.2 billion) of Russian central bank assets in reaction to Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in February last year. Another 30 billion euros of Russian oligarchs' private assets were also immobilised.Leaders of member states meeting in Brussels will ask the EU's executive Commission and other bodies to press on with research into how they can put the Russian money to work for Ukraine  draft conclusions of the summit showed.During months of debate on the issue  lawyers have said there is no legal precedent to simply take the money  and the Kremlin warned in November it would do everything it could to stop the West ""plundering"" its assets.EU officials say they have been looking at alternatives  for example taking accrued interest or bond coupons or taxing such profits.""The European Council took stock of the work done regarding Russia‚Äôs immobilised assets  and invites the Council  the High Representative and the Commission to take work forward  in accordance with EU and international law  and in coordination with partners "" the draft conclusion read.Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas said Russia and its oligarchs had a legitimate claim on the frozen assets  but Ukraine also had a legitimate claim against Russia over the damage it had caused.""It's fundamentally wrong that our taxpayers get to pay for something that we haven't caused.

That is seen as bad for gold  since higher rates lift returns for investors buying bonds or keeping their money in cash  or a money-market fund.""The higher the yield on Treasuries  the more likely traders seeking safe haven financial instruments will choose interest-bearing products rather than plug their money into gold "" Mizuho said.---Copper fell  but losses could be limited.Gains in copper have been curbed by a media report that Codelco  world's largest copper producer  has resumed operations at its Andina copper mine after closing it earlier owing to rain storms  ANZ Research said.However  inventories of base metals at commodity exchanges are at relatively low levels  which leaves the markets vulnerable to sudden tightening should demand pick up strongly  it added.---Chinese iron ore prices were higher  extending the previous session's gains  amid hopes Beijing will unveil a new round of property stimulus measures.""The prospect of further stimulus measures boosted sentiment in the iron ore market "" ANZ said.BHP CEO Mike Henry also urged Beijing to take more measures to boost the property sector at a meeting in Brisbane  Australia on Tuesday.TODAY'S TOP HEADLINESU.S. Considers New Curbs on AI Chip Exports to ChinaThe Biden administration is considering new restrictions on exports of artificial intelligence chips to China  as concerns rise over the power of the technology in the hands of U.S. rivals  according to people familiar with the situation.The Commerce Department could move as soon as early next month to stop the shipments of chips made by Nvidia and other chip makers to customers in China and other countries of concern without first obtaining a license  the people said.Russian Missile Attack Kills Two at Busy Restaurant in East UkraineKYIV-A Russian missile strike on Kramatorsk in eastern Ukraine killed two people and wounded at least 22 on Tuesday  authorities said  as a restaurant popular with Ukrainian troops was hit during peak dinner hours.Andriy Yermak  the chief of staff to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky  posted a photo of the damaged building in Kramatorsk  and footage shared from the scene showed its smoldering ruins and emergency crews sifting through the rubble.Rio Tinto Building Australian Battery Lab to Test MineralsRio Tinto  the world's second-biggest miner by market value  is building a battery lab in Australia where it can test how the commodities it produces work in the likes of electric-vehicle batteries  said the company's minerals chief  Sinead Kaufman.In prepared remarks for an industry forum on Wednesday  Kaufman said Rio Tinto's battery lab in Melbourne is expected to be operational by November and is intended to improve the miner's understanding of battery production  manufacturing and chemistry.Google Violated Its Standards in Ad Deals  Research FindsGoogle violated its promised standards when placing video ads on other websites  according to new research that raises questions about the transparency of the tech giant's online-ad business.Google's YouTube runs ads on its own site and app. But the company also brokers the placement of video ads on other sites across the web through a program called Google Video Partners.

The European‚Ä¶,"LONDON  June 28 (Reuters) - European Union plans to relocate clearing in euro denominated derivatives from London to the bloc should be phased in with no mandatory quotas on banks initially  a senior member of the European Parliament said on Wednesday.The European Commission has proposed a draft law that would force banks in the EU to open ""active accounts"" at an EU-based clearing house to clear a yet-to-be-determined number of contracts such as euro interest rate swaps (IRS).Clearing of euro IRS is dominated globally by London Stock Exchange Group's LCH arm in London  a source of concern for some EU policymakers since Britain's departure from the bloc. Voluntary efforts to persuade EU banks to shift clearing to Deutsche Boerse in Frankfurt have made only modest headway.Danuta Huebner on Wednesday proposed a two-phased approach  with mandatory quotas ditched from the first phase to protect the competitiveness of EU market participants  giving time to encourage business in the bloc to build up.Instead  there should be a stronger focus in the first phase on ""supply side"" factors to make clearing in the EU more attractive  such as making it faster for clearers to introduce new products  said Huebner  a member of the assembly's centre right EPP grouping.""This is possibly the single most effective and most sustainable way to increase clearing in the EU "" Huebner told parliament's economic affairs committee.In a second phase  the EU's securities watchdog  ESMA  would assess if enough clearing had shifted to end excessive reliance on London  and whether quotas were required  Huebner said.This phased approach introduces enough flexibility to address the tension between the political goal of cutting dependence on London and maintaining market competitiveness  she said.She will lead parliament's negotiations with EU states from the autumn on a final deal  but must first find consensus among committee members.Aurore Lalucq from the assembly's Socialist bloc said she would not support such a phased approach  and a European Commission official said ""meaningful"" active accounts were needed.The EU has given Britain's clearers access to EU clients only until the end of June 2025. EU banks warn that quotas could leave their clients financially worse off by being cut off from efficient global pools of liquidity in London.Huebner also proposed giving ESMA more supervisory powers over EU clearing houses  a step some EU states are likely to challenge.(Reporting by Huw Jones Editing by Alison Williams and Mark Potter)",neutral,0.01,0.8,0.19,negative,0.0,0.2,0.8,True,English,"['mandatory euro derivatives', 'EU lawmaker', 'quotas', 'centre right EPP grouping', 'euro interest rate swaps', 'London Stock Exchange Group', 'euro denominated derivatives', 'supply side"" factors', 'single most effective', 'efficient global pools', 'economic affairs committee', 'European Commission official', 'The European Commission', 'meaningful"" active accounts', 'EU-based clearing house', 'EU market participants', 'EU clearing houses', 'European Union', 'euro IRS', 'committee members', 'draft law', 'LCH arm', 'Voluntary efforts', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'modest headway', 'first phase', 'stronger focus', 'new products', 'sustainable way', 'second phase', 'securities watchdog', 'excessive reliance', 'enough flexibility', 'political goal', 'market competitiveness', 'final deal', 'Aurore Lalucq', 'supervisory powers', 'Huw Jones', 'Alison Williams', 'Mark Potter', 'EU policymakers', 'EU states', 'European Parliament', 'enough clearing', 'mandatory quotas', 'senior member', 'clearers access', 'EU banks', 'EU clients', 'two-phased approach', 'Socialist bloc', 'Danuta Huebner', 'June', 'Reuters', 'Wednesday', 'number', 'contracts', 'source', 'concern', 'Britain', 'departure', 'Frankfurt', 'time', 'business', 'assembly', 'ESMA', 'tension', 'dependence', 'negotiations', 'autumn', 'consensus', 'liquidity', 'step']",2023-06-28,2023-06-29,marketscreener.com

It sees these so-called consolidated tapes as crucial to efforts to harmonize ,Comment on this story Comment Gift Article ShareThe European Union wants to establish up-to-the-minute price feeds for various asset classes traded across the region  including stocks and bonds. It sees these so-called consolidated tapes as crucial to efforts to harmonize  modernize and even democratize the bloc‚Äôs capital markets. While the concept has broad support  implementation of the tapes has proved painfully slow as the industry tussles over the underlying nuts and bolts ‚Äî though a significant hurdle was cleared at the end of June.1. What is a consolidated trading tape?It‚Äôs technology that collates information about the price  size and timing of trades happening across multiple trading venues  and spits them out in a centralized  real-time feed. This can include either pre-trade or post-trade data  or both. The EU wants to put tapes in place for shares  exchange-traded funds (ETFs)  bonds and derivatives  with the aim of improving the quality and transparency of data for investors.Advertisement2. Do they already exist elsewhere?Yes  the US and Canada have had consolidated tapes for years  though their usefulness as a blueprint is limited given the complexities of Europe‚Äôs market structure. The UK is working on its own regulatory framework  due to be in place by 2024  to help establish a tape.3. What are the advantages?The biggest selling point is better transparency  making it easier for investors of all stripes to access information and determine whether they obtained the best price for their trade (known as best execution). The European Commission  the EU‚Äôs executive arm  also argues that it will make the region‚Äôs capital markets more attractive  both domestically and among international investors  thanks to greater efficiencies and data quality at a pan-European level.4. What areas would benefit?AdvertisementThe tape could help boost liquidity in sectors where it‚Äôs much needed  such as corporate bonds. That prompted suggestions that a fixed-income tape should be prioritized ahead of other asset classes. Smaller funds and retail investors may reap the biggest benefits because larger firms already have superior access to trading data. The tape could also help raise the profile of smaller companies beyond their own local markets  and help revive moribund equity markets across the region.5. What does ‚Äòreal time‚Äô mean in practice?That depends  given the different ways instruments are traded. It could take several minutes for the fixed-income tape to publish the data  while in the case of stocks and ETFs  it could be a matter of milliseconds. Policymakers rejected an early proposal from exchanges for a ‚Äúspeed limit‚Äù or 15-minute delay  an idea also criticized by asset managers who say real-time data is crucial for investment decisions. The inclusion of pre-trade data has proved contentious among exchanges  which are concerned about the impact on existing revenues.Advertisement6. What are some of the other main concerns?Liquidity providers within the fixed-income market are also anxious about too much transparency. They‚Äôre worried that prices will move if the market gets wind of a large or illiquid trade and they want measures that will mask the price and size of such transactions. Meanwhile  the International Swaps and Derivatives Association has deemed a tape for derivatives ‚Äúpremature‚Äù and just not that useful  given fundamental differences in the trading  liquidity and transparency of these instruments versus stocks and bonds.7. Who‚Äôs going to pay for it?The idea is that all execution platforms will have to share their trading data with the consolidated tape providers. The providers (CTPs) will charge users to access the tapes  and then share the revenue with the platforms. The challenge is to ensure the cost of accessing the tape is reasonable  while also ensuring it‚Äôs commercially viable.Advertisement8. How close is Europe to getting a tape in place?It‚Äôs getting closer. Plans to develop a consolidated tape were included in a package that the European Commission adopted in November 2021 to develop the so-called capital markets union. Since then  debate has raged. In a major breakthrough in late June  member states reached a provisional deal with the European Parliament after Sweden  in its role with the EU presidency  engineered a compromise by proposing that some valuable data be kept anonymous. The deal still requires formal approval and technical and operational details need to be worked out.9. What infrastructure needs to be put in place?Companies are already jockeying to become the tape provider for the various asset classes. They include a consortium of 14 European exchange groups including Deutsche Boerse  Nasdaq and Euronext that want to run the equities tape. Bloomberg  MarketAxess and Tradeweb have joined forces in a quest to be the fixed-income provider. Technology firm TransFICC has built a pilot for bonds that‚Äôs already being tested.

The group owns the luxury yacht marques Riva  Pershing  Custom Line  Ferretti Yachts  Itama  and the custom superyacht brand CRN.The company celebrated the listing by positioning a Riva Anniversario outside the stock-exchange building in Milan‚Äôs Piazza Affari. Ferretti CEO Alberto Galassi said his company was ‚Äúthe first and only Group in the world‚Äîand not just in the luxury yacht industry‚Äîto achieve this double listing in Asia and Europe.‚ÄùOn June 21  Ferretti started taking stock orders from investors in anticipation of the listing.

Courtesy Ferretti GroupFerretti completed its initial public offering (IPO) in Hong Kong just over a year ago. In 2018  it attempted a similar IPO on the Milan exchange but had to scuttle it due to a lack of investor appetite.The dual listing is expected to provide growth capital moving forward as Ferretti continues to pursue an ambitious growth agenda that started shortly after Galassi became CEO in 2014. Its new launches were particularly strong during the pandemic: Ferretti grew the number of models across its different brands to 54 last year  up from 42 in 2021.Recent launches include the Custom Line Navetta 38  Pershing GTX116  Ferretti Yachts 580  wallypower58X  and Wallywhy150.

Its BtoB renovation subsidiary  Atelier des Compagnons (ADC)  is placing Itself under the protection of the commercial court. This subsidiary  acquired in 2017 under completely different economic conditions  employs 237 people  posted revenue of ‚Ç¨93.7 million  and generated a loss of ‚Ç¨31.1 million in 2022.The recent COVID pandemic and the war in Ukraine have disrupted construction sites and inflated material costs  both of which have severely impacted this subsidiary's results. These circumstantial difficulties combined with rapid  but poorly controlled growth worsened the situation  further compromising the subsidiary's performance. In addition  most of this entity's contracts were not indexed to inflation and have a relatively long production cycle with delays of 12 to 36 months between the acceptance of the offer and the delivery of the site. The inertia induced by these long-term contracts and the Impossibility to pass on the sharp rise in the cost of materials slowed down the recovery of this subsidiary.As a result  and despite financial and organizational support from the group in 2022 and 2023  Hexaom's management decided to file for bankruptcy protection with the commercial court for its subsidiary ADC. A hearing will be held next week.An observation period should be announced during which management and executives will make every effort to determine take over solutions for ADC.This decision will protect the group Hexaom's financial structure and help maintain its position as a leading player in the French housing market.Only the ADC subsidiary is concerned by this filing. No subsidiary related to the other businesses Hexaom is refocusing on will be impacted.ABOUT THE GROUPSince 1919  five generations of the same family have successively taken over the helm of Hexaom  a group that drives and federates an ecosystem of 46 brands and subsidiaries with complementary expertise.

This should facilitate e-invoicing reforms across the Union which will lead to improved efficiency. However  the reforms will require businesses to make major changes to the way they issue and receive invoices.Italy  for example  has had a comprehensive B2B e-invoicing regime in place since 2019  which led to the launch of the highly successful Fattura SMART solution from Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting (TAA) Italy. Fattura SMART is a leading digital solution which manages the entire e-invoicing process  enabling our customers to communicate and collaborate with their clients efficiently and effectively.Belgium  Denmark and Spain are other countries with ongoing reforms to introduce B2B e-invoicing obligations  most of which are currently expected to come into effect in January 2024. EU countries with similar plans include France  Slovakia  Poland  Bulgaria  Finland and Romania.From 2028  VAT in the Digital Age (ViDA) reforms proposed by the European Commission will also make e-invoicing compulsory for cross-border B2B transactions within the EU under a new Digital Reporting System (DRS). The expectation of the EU Commission is that by 2028 all existing national e-invoicing systems will align with the DRS. Countries that do not have e-invoicing in place by 2028 will have the option of adopting the DRS requirements for their domestic B2B transactions.Additional important reforms contained in ViDA state that  from 2025  online platforms will have more Value-Added Tax (VAT) reporting obligations and be treated as the relevant supplier/VAT payer in an increasing number of cases. Also  the One-Stop Shop (OSS) scheme  which allows a business to comply with VAT obligations across the EU with a single VAT registration  will expand to cover more types of B2C transactions.Why: The VAT gap is an estimate of the overall difference between the expected VAT revenue and the amount actually collected. EU member states lost an estimated ‚Ç¨93 billion in VAT revenues in 2020  according to the 2022 Report on the VAT Gap released by the European Commission. This translates to ‚Ç¨3 000 in VAT revenues being lost every second in the EU.In a bid to improve VAT collection and mitigate these losses  the EU has launched an action plan which focuses on digitizing all transactions  making them more transparent and traceable so that taxes can be collected correctly. VAT in the Digital Age (ViDA) is the package adopted by the European Commission to optimize the EU‚Äôs VAT system.Who: Legal expert  Piermario Porcheddu of Wolters Kluwer TAA Europe  can discuss the topics that business owners should consider when exploring e-invoicing reforms across the European Union.PLEASE NOTE: These materials are designed to provide accurate and authoritative information in regard to the subject matter covered.

Following work carried out by the Group's general management in conjunction with an Ad Hoc Committee made up of the Chairpersons of the Board Committees  and taking into consideration the various analyses and offers already received  the Group‚Äôs Board of Directors has agreed to enter into exclusive negotiations with BNP Paribas to define a referral partnership for the Orange Bank customer portfolio in France  and to develop financing solutions for mobile devices. The two groups will also discuss the terms of a takeover of Orange Bank's business in Spain.This partnership with BNP Paribas  which will provide a continuity solution for Orange Bank customers  is part of Orange‚Äôs wider intention to progressively withdraw Orange Bank from the retail banking market in France and Spain. This decision was taken without the presence of the Chairman of Orange's Board of Directors  who chose to withdraw from the decision-making and voting process given his membership of the Board of BNP Paribas. This operation  which only concerns Orange‚Äôs activities in France and Spain  will have no impact on the Group's financial trajectory for the 2023-2025 period as presented at the Capital Market Day on 16 February 2023.This project will be subject to various information and consultation procedures with employee representative bodies  which will begin shortly. The process will be conducted in full transparency  providing information on actions undertaken to find a partner and with priority being given to informing and supporting all employees (internal redeployment  training). The Group will also work closely with all the relevant authorities and regulators.Throughout the process  there will be no change in services  in existing loans or day-to-day operations for customers  including the taking of deposits and the granting of loans. The full range of information on Orange Bank products and services will continue to be available on orangebank.fr and orangebank.es .Orange Bank today has a solid balance sheet and will continue to meet all its regulatory obligations until its future withdrawal from the market.Christel Heydemann  Orange Group CEO commented: ""I'd like to thank our teams who  thanks to their hard work and commitment  have made Orange Bank a bank that today serves over two million customers and that benefits from one of the best applications on the market. The evolution of the banking market now leads us to guide the bank into a new phase. Our priority will be to provide exemplary support for all our employees and customers. This process will be carried out in complete transparency  within the framework of our dialogue with our staff representative bodies.

This should facilitate e-invoicing reforms across the Union which will lead to improved efficiency. However  the reforms will require businesses to make major changes to the way they issue and receive invoices.Italy  for example  has had a comprehensive B2B e-invoicing regime in place since 2019  which led to the launch of the highly successful Fattura SMART solution from Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting (TAA) Italy. Fattura SMART is a leading digital solution which manages the entire e-invoicing process  enabling our customers to communicate and collaborate with their clients efficiently and effectively.Belgium  Denmark and Spain are other countries with ongoing reforms to introduce B2B e-invoicing obligations  most of which are currently expected to come into effect in January 2024. EU countries with similar plans include France  Slovakia  Poland  Bulgaria  Finland and Romania.From 2028  VAT in the Digital Age (ViDA) reforms proposed by the European Commission will also make e-invoicing compulsory for cross-border B2B transactions within the EU under a new Digital Reporting System (DRS). The expectation of the EU Commission is that by 2028 all existing national e-invoicing systems will align with the DRS. Countries that do not have e-invoicing in place by 2028 will have the option of adopting the DRS requirements for their domestic B2B transactions.Additional important reforms contained in ViDA state that  from 2025  online platforms will have more Value-Added Tax (VAT) reporting obligations and be treated as the relevant supplier/VAT payer in an increasing number of cases. Also  the One-Stop Shop (OSS) scheme  which allows a business to comply with VAT obligations across the EU with a single VAT registration  will expand to cover more types of B2C transactions.Why: The VAT gap is an estimate of the overall difference between the expected VAT revenue and the amount actually collected. EU member states lost an estimated ‚Ç¨93 billion in VAT revenues in 2020  according to the 2022 Report on the VAT Gap released by the European Commission. This translates to ‚Ç¨3 000 in VAT revenues being lost every second in the EU.In a bid to improve VAT collection and mitigate these losses  the EU has launched an action plan which focuses on digitizing all transactions  making them more transparent and traceable so that taxes can be collected correctly. VAT in the Digital Age (ViDA) is the package adopted by the European Commission to optimize the EU‚Äôs VAT system.Who: Legal expert  Piermario Porcheddu of Wolters Kluwer TAA Europe  can discuss the topics that business owners should consider when exploring e-invoicing reforms across the European Union.PLEASE NOTE: These materials are designed to provide accurate and authoritative information in regard to the subject matter covered.

Following work carried out by the Group's general management in conjunction with an Ad Hoc Committee made up of the Chairpersons of the Board Committees  and taking into consideration the various analyses and offers already received  the Group‚Äôs Board of Directors has agreed to enter into exclusive negotiations with BNP Paribas to define a referral partnership for the Orange Bank customer portfolio in France  and to develop financing solutions for mobile devices. The two groups will also discuss the terms of a takeover of Orange Bank's business in Spain.This partnership with BNP Paribas  which will provide a continuity solution for Orange Bank customers  is part of Orange‚Äôs wider intention to progressively withdraw Orange Bank from the retail banking market in France and Spain. This decision was taken without the presence of the Chairman of Orange's Board of Directors  who chose to withdraw from the decision-making and voting process given his membership of the Board of BNP Paribas. This operation  which only concerns Orange‚Äôs activities in France and Spain  will have no impact on the Group's financial trajectory for the 2023-2025 period as presented at the Capital Market Day on 16 February 2023.This project will be subject to various information and consultation procedures with employee representative bodies  which will begin shortly. The process will be conducted in full transparency  providing information on actions undertaken to find a partner and with priority being given to informing and supporting all employees (internal redeployment  training). The Group will also work closely with all the relevant authorities and regulators.Throughout the process  there will be no change in services  in existing loans or day-to-day operations for customers  including the taking of deposits and the granting of loans. The full range of information on Orange Bank products and services will continue to be available on orangebank.fr and orangebank.es .Orange Bank today has a solid balance sheet and will continue to meet all its regulatory obligations until its future withdrawal from the market.Christel Heydemann  Orange Group CEO commented: ""I'd like to thank our teams who  thanks to their hard work and commitment  have made Orange Bank a bank that today serves over two million customers and that benefits from one of the best applications on the market. The evolution of the banking market now leads us to guide the bank into a new phase. Our priority will be to provide exemplary support for all our employees and customers. This process will be carried out in complete transparency  within the framework of our dialogue with our staff representative bodies. I know that I can also count on the commitment and excellence of the teams at BNP Paribas to provide the best possible support for our customers"".Thierry Laborde  Chief Operating Officer of BNP Paribas said: ""As a long-standing partner of the Orange Group and Orange Bank  we are naturally delighted to be able to provide a complete continuity solution to Orange Bank customers following Orange Group‚Äôs strategic choice to withdraw from retail banking. Whether it's day-to-day digital banking with Hello Bank  consumer credit with BNP Paribas Personal Finance  or insurance  which we already operate through a partnership between BNP Paribas Cardif and Orange  we will support customers with a solid banking package and high-performance services"".About OrangeOrange is one of the world‚Äôs leading telecommunications operators with revenues of 43.5 billion euros in 2022 and 136 000 employees worldwide at 31 March 2023  including 74 000 employees in France.

(Euronext Growth Paris: ALTME)  a biotechnology company focused on developing novel therapies for treatment of cancer by targeting the tumor microenvironment (TME)  announces a positive clinical update on the survival offirst-lineglioblastoma patients in the GLORIA expansion arm evaluatingNOX-A12 TME Pharma'sCXCL12 inhibitor  in combination with standard of care radiotherapy andanti-VEGF bevacizumab. After 15 months on study (median)  83% of GLORIA expansion arm patients (5 of 6) remain alive. As long as treatment or follow-up for these patients is ongoing  median overall survival (mOS) will continue to improve1. As a reference  the expected median overall survival for patients under current standard of care with chemotherapy refractory tumors (MGMT unmethylated) and whose tumor remains detectable after surgical intervention is approximately 10 months2. ""Reaching the 15-month survival point with this expansion arm is a significant milestone in our development of NOX-A12 in glioblastoma  and to do so with more than 80 percent of patients still on study represents a fantastic achievement "" saidAram Mangasarian  CEO of TME Pharma. ""This latest set of survival data further underlines the clinically meaningful improvement that this treatment combination of NOX-A12  radiotherapy and bevacizumab could bring over the current standard of care for this challenging indication with extremely poor prognosis. We are building an enviable clinical profile around our lead asset in glioblastoma  which strengthens NOX-A12's position for potential partnering and our coming discussions with regulators regarding the pathway to market."" In a clinical study  measuring the median overall survival (mOS) is one way to assess how well a new treatment works. The longer the patients remain alive  the longer it takes to reach mOS. mOS can only be calculated when more than half of patients in the study decease. Kreth 2013  Annals of Oncology 24:3117. Rounded up from mOS 9.7 months reported in patients with incomplete resection  without MGMT promoter methylation who received standard of care (radiotherapy +/- chemotherapy).For more information  please contact: TME Pharma N.V.

Implanted via a transcatheter route through a small incision in the chest and heart and equipped with a deployable hooking mechanism that allows the prosthetic to securely attach without the need for sutures  Epygon allows for a rapid and minimally invasive procedure on the beating heart  avoiding open heart surgery. The results we have seen so far from our first successful implantation in a high-risk patient are very promising  underlining the potential of our prosthetic to become a game-changer in structural cardiology.‚ÄúPositive results from the first patient implanted with the Epygon mitral valve were announced in April 2023 indicating the safety of the procedure  improvement of functional status and hemodynamic patterns. The patient  a 62-year-old woman  presented with a severe mitral insufficiency profile associated with comorbidities: severe diabetes  severe tricuspid regurgitation with a pacemaker  and ischemic heart disease  with risk of infarction. The transcatheter implantation of the Epygon device allowed to avoid an open-heart procedure  with a 15-minute valve positioning time and a short stay in intensive care. The patient was promptly discharged from the hospital for cardiac rehabilitation at D+5.Shortly after the patient showed a significant improvement in health status. At the one- month follow-up  the patient‚Äôs functional status had improved  changing the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional status from III to II  meaning that the patient is able to resume basic day to day activities without getting out of breath. The echocardiography showed excellent function of the Epygon valve.Epygon is currently being evaluated in the ongoing first-in-human study titled Minerva ‚Äì Mitral valve INsufficiency with Epygon tRanscatheter mitral VAlve system ‚Äì  a prospective  multicenter  non-randomized  single-arm study of the minimally invasive medical device for mitral valve regurgitation. Conducted at nine clinical investigation centers in Italy  Austria  Spain and Serbia  the pilot study will include 10 to 15 adult patients with severe mitral regurgitation  with an NYHA functional class III to IV  an LVEF (ejection fraction) greater than or equal to 30% and at high risk for mitral valve surgery. The objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Epygon valve implantation at 30 days. Patients will be monitored for five years.Affluent Medical anticipates presenting interim results from the first five patients of the Minerva pilot study at the Annual Meeting of the European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (EACTS) in October 2023.About Epygon valveEpygon is the first biomimetic transcatheter mitral valve that restores the natural vortex of blood flow in the left ventricle  thereby promoting recovery of ventricular function  particularly in frail patients with severely altered cardiac conditions. It is designed to potentially ensure superior clinical outcomes in patients with severe mitral regurgitation.The unique features of the device include a single leaflet made of pericardial tissue combined with a D-shaped stent. The asymmetric nitinol stent with its anatomical anchoring systems ensures a stable anchoring under the mitral annulus by capturing the native leaflets and achieving an optimal fit with a low risk of LVOT (left ventricular outflow tract) obstruction. The transcatheter implantation makes it a rapid and minimally invasive procedure avoiding open heart surgery.About Affluent MedicalAffluent Medical is a French MedTech company  founded by Truffle Capital  with the ambition to become a global leader in the treatment of structural heart diseases  which are the world's leading cause of mortality  and urinary incontinence currently affecting one in four adults.Affluent Medical develops next-generation  minimally-invasive  innovative  adjustable  and biomimetic implants to restore critical physiological functions.
