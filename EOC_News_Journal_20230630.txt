STAHL Annual General Meeting resolves nearly all agenda items with clear majorities30th Annual General Meeting held as a presence event again168 of shareholders were in attendance for the votesAttendance was 64.10% after 58.66% at last year‚Äôs virtual AGMSupervisory Board member newly electedWaldenburg  29 June 2023 - R. STAHL today held its 30th Annual General Meeting as a presence event in the Nobelgusch Community and Festival Hall in the German town of Pfedelbach after three years in a virtual format. With 4.1 million shares  the proportion of the total share capital represented at the Annual General Meeting was 64.10% and thus slightly above the previous year‚Äôs attendance (58.66%). Including the postal votes  78.68% of the capital stock was represented (previous year 79.82%).The actions of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board for financial year 2022 were approved by a clear majority of shareholders. BDO AG  Wirtschaftspr√ºfungsgesellschaft  Hamburg  was elected as auditor and Group auditor for financial year 2023. The shareholders present also approved the compensation report for the Executive Board and Supervisory Board. The amendments to the Articles of Association authorizing the Executive Board to convene virtual Annual General Meetings were also approved by a large majority. R. STAHL‚Äôs Executive Board and Supervisory Board do  however  generally prefer the presence of shareholders at Annual General Meetings to the virtual format.Executive Board explains strategy and offers positive outlookAfter CEO Dr. Mathias Hallmann looked back on a successful financial year in 2022  he outlined the corporate strategy adopted to the shareholders. Dr. Hallmann focused in particular on the topics of internationalization and digitalization. He also presented promising growth fields (LNG  hydrogen  nuclear) and R. STAHL‚Äôs positioning in these markets in greater detail.The Executive Board remains confident for the current financial year  despite the ongoing tense procurement markets. Dr. Hallmann confirmed the forecasts for full-year 2023. R. STAHL expects sales of between ‚Ç¨ 305 million and ‚Ç¨ 320 million and EBITDA pre exceptionals of ‚Ç¨ 30 million to ‚Ç¨ 36 million for the current year. ‚ÄúThe new strategic direction is beginning to take effect  our sales markets are picking up  and R. STAHL is well positioned to take advantage of the growth opportunities that present themselves. I therefore expect R. STAHL to grow profitably on a sustained basis in the years ahead‚Äù  said CEO Dr. Hallmann.Annual General Meeting elects new member of the Supervisory BoardThe regular election of Supervisory Board members from among the shareholders brought about one change. After Ms. Heike Dannenbauer was no longer available for election after 15 years on the committee  Dennis Stahl was elected to the Supervisory Board. All other existing members were confirmed in office. The constituent meeting following the Annual General Meeting elected again Peter Leischner as Chairman and Prof. Dr. Peter Hofmann as his deputy.The detailed voting results of today's Annual General Meeting will be available shortly on the Company's website under Investor Relations (Annual General Meeting | Investor Relations | Corporate | R.

The FDA is currently reviewing the New Drug Application (NDA) for palovarotene with a decision anticipated by August 16  2023. If approved  palovarotene will be the first treatment in the U.S. for FOP.‚ÄúWe are pleased with the outcome today and believe that the vote of the FDA advisory committee conveys the potential of palovarotene in helping manage the severe impacts of FOP. For people living with this ultra-rare bone disease  mobility is severely restricted and they experience a significant loss of function  all of which completely changes the course of their lives and can shorten life-expectancy ‚Äù said Howard Mayer  Executive Vice President and Head of Research and Development for Ipsen. ‚ÄúWe are very grateful to the patients and healthcare professionals who have participated in our clinical trials and to the individuals who selflessly shared their very personal experiences of living with FOP during the advisory committee. We will continue to work closely with the FDA on the next steps.‚ÄùThe advisory committee voted 10 for and 4 against that evidence from the Phase III MOVE study show palovarotene is an effective treatment in patients with the ultra-rare bone disease fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP). The committee further voted 11 for and 3 against on the benefits of palovarotene outweighing the risks  for the treatment of patients with FOP.FOP is an ultra-rare disease that causes permanent and continuous bone growth in soft and connective tissues like muscles  tendons and ligaments  also known as heterotopic ossification or HO.1 FOP impacts the lives of an estimated 400 people in the U.S. and 900 people globally.2 3 As the disease continuously progresses with flare-up episodes causing rapid bone growth  FOP severely restricts mobility and function.3 Most people living with FOP inevitably lose the ability to eat and drink on their own  can not provide self-care or use the restroom themselves  and are unable to maintain employment.4 By the age of 30  most people with FOP require a wheelchair and full-time caregiver assistance.2 Without disease-modifying treatments  current management is limited to palliative care  and ultimately  FOP shortens the median life expectancy to 56 years as untimely death is caused by bone formation around the ribcage leading to breathing problems and cardiorespiratory failure.2The advisory committee‚Äôs recommendation is based on its review of the efficacy and safety data package for palovarotene  that included results from the Phase III MOVE trial  the first and largest multicenter  open-label trial in adult and pediatric patients  which demonstrated a clinically meaningful reduction in new abnormal bone formation (HO) and a well-characterized safety profile.5Palovarotene; a potential treatment for FOPPalovarotene is an investigational oral medicine that selectively targets the retinoic-acid receptor gamma (RARŒ≥)  which is an important regulator of skeletal development and ectopic bone in the retinoid signaling pathway. Palovarotene is designed to mediate the interactions between the receptors  growth factors and proteins within the retinoid signaling pathway to reduce new abnormal bone formation (HO). Palovarotene received Orphan Drug and Breakthrough Therapy Designations from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the potential treatment of FOP and was granted Priority Review. Palovarotene is also under review with a number of regulatory authorities. Palovarotene is currently authorized for use in appropriate patients in Canada and United Arab Emirates where it is marketed as SohonosTM (palovarotene capsules).6ENDSAbout IpsenIpsen is a global  mid-sized biopharmaceutical company focused on transformative medicines in Oncology  Rare Disease and Neuroscience.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen‚Äôs future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‚Äòbelieves‚Äô  ‚Äòanticipates‚Äô and ‚Äòexpects‚Äô and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen‚Äôs expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen‚Äôs patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen‚Äôs activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen‚Äôs partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen‚Äôs business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law. Ipsen‚Äôs business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorit√© des March√©s Financiers.

The FDA is currently reviewing the New Drug Application (NDA) for palovarotene with a decision anticipated by August 16  2023. If approved  palovarotene will be the first treatment in the U.S. for FOP.‚ÄúWe are pleased with the outcome today and believe that the vote of the FDA advisory committee conveys the potential of palovarotene in helping manage the severe impacts of FOP. For people living with this ultra-rare bone disease  mobility is severely restricted and they experience a significant loss of function  all of which completely changes the course of their lives and can shorten life-expectancy ‚Äù said Howard Mayer  Executive Vice President and Head of Research and Development for Ipsen. ‚ÄúWe are very grateful to the patients and healthcare professionals who have participated in our clinical trials and to the individuals who selflessly shared their very personal experiences of living with FOP during the advisory committee. We will continue to work closely with the FDA on the next steps.‚ÄùThe advisory committee voted 10 for and 4 against that evidence from the Phase III MOVE study show palovarotene is an effective treatment in patients with the ultra-rare bone disease fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP). The committee further voted 11 for and 3 against on the benefits of palovarotene outweighing the risks  for the treatment of patients with FOP.FOP is an ultra-rare disease that causes permanent and continuous bone growth in soft and connective tissues like muscles  tendons and ligaments  also known as heterotopic ossification or HO.1 FOP impacts the lives of an estimated 400 people in the U.S. and 900 people globally.2 3 As the disease continuously progresses with flare-up episodes causing rapid bone growth  FOP severely restricts mobility and function.3 Most people living with FOP inevitably lose the ability to eat and drink on their own  can not provide self-care or use the restroom themselves  and are unable to maintain employment.4 By the age of 30  most people with FOP require a wheelchair and full-time caregiver assistance.2 Without disease-modifying treatments  current management is limited to palliative care  and ultimately  FOP shortens the median life expectancy to 56 years as untimely death is caused by bone formation around the ribcage leading to breathing problems and cardiorespiratory failure.2The advisory committee‚Äôs recommendation is based on its review of the efficacy and safety data package for palovarotene  that included results from the Phase III MOVE trial  the first and largest multicenter  open-label trial in adult and pediatric patients  which demonstrated a clinically meaningful reduction in new abnormal bone formation (HO) and a well-characterized safety profile.5Palovarotene; a potential treatment for FOPPalovarotene is an investigational oral medicine that selectively targets the retinoic-acid receptor gamma (RARŒ≥)  which is an important regulator of skeletal development and ectopic bone in the retinoid signaling pathway. Palovarotene is designed to mediate the interactions between the receptors  growth factors and proteins within the retinoid signaling pathway to reduce new abnormal bone formation (HO). Palovarotene received Orphan Drug and Breakthrough Therapy Designations from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the potential treatment of FOP and was granted Priority Review. Palovarotene is also under review with a number of regulatory authorities. Palovarotene is currently authorized for use in appropriate patients in Canada and United Arab Emirates where it is marketed as SohonosTM (palovarotene capsules).6ENDSAbout IpsenIpsen is a global  mid-sized biopharmaceutical company focused on transformative medicines in Oncology  Rare Disease and Neuroscience.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen‚Äôs future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‚Äòbelieves‚Äô  ‚Äòanticipates‚Äô and ‚Äòexpects‚Äô and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen‚Äôs expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen‚Äôs patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen‚Äôs activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen‚Äôs partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen‚Äôs business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law.

It should be noted that following the announcement of the agreement reached in June 2023 on the sale of its stake in Boston Limited (press release of 16 June 2023)  the scope of 2CRSi is expected to change very significantly. The refocusing on the innovation and production activity  the core business of the 2CRSi Group  is still expected for July 2023.Simplified income statement In millions of EUR - IFRS 2022/2023 estimated 2021-2022 final Revenue 184.4 183.6 Consumed purchases (142.3) (143.2) Margin on revenue 42.1 40.4 Gross margin rate 22.8% 22.0% Other income 0.8 2.5 External expenses (12.2) (10.9) Personnel expenses (27.1) (23.6) Taxes (0.6) (0.5) Other operating income and expenses (1.4) 0.5 EBITDA 1.7 8.4 EBITDA margin 0.9% 4.6% Current operating income (expense) (8.9) 1.4 Current operating margin 0.8% Operating income (expense) (8.9) 1.4 Net financial income (2.6) (3.0) Income tax (0.8) (0.5) Consolidated net income (expense) (12.4) (1.1) Consolidated net income  Group share (11.6) (1.1)‚ÄúFY 2022-2023 was a particularly challenging period  with inflationary pressures and persistent component shortages weighing on our business momentum despite growing interest in our global technology solutions. As announced at the time of the publication of our revenue  these contrasting business conditions negatively impact profitability for the year. Nonetheless  we remain fully confident in our development prospects. The sale of Boston Limited will not only help strengthen our financial position but will also allow us to focus on our historic core business  where we continue to make a difference in innovation  performance and consideration of environmental issues  today's priority for all global technology players. We are therefore in a position to take a new step forward in the Group's development‚Äù says Alain Wilmouth  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of 2CRSI.Stable activity in a demanding environmentAs announced in the publication of 2 May 2023  the 2CRSi Group generated revenue of ‚Ç¨184.4 million compared with ‚Ç¨183.6 million for the 2021-2022 financial year. This stability reflects the impact of persistent shortages in electronic component supplies  which weighed on the execution of several orders that had initially been scheduled for the end of the financial year.Despite this particularly demanding environment  sales momentum remained solid  particularly in the defence  cloud and scientific research sectors.Increase in gross marginFor the year  the gross margin amounted to ‚Ç¨42.1 million. It accounted for 22.8% of revenue vs. 22% in the previous year  reflecting the good control of purchases despite supply conditions. Other business income stood at ‚Ç¨0.8 million vs. ‚Ç¨2.5 million in 2021-2022. This change includes an unfavourable comparison base  with the 2021-2022 financial year incorporating exceptional business income of around ‚Ç¨1.7 million as part of the legal reorganisation of Blade.EBITDA should remain positiveIn addition to the level of activity affected by delays in order execution  operating profitability was penalised by inflationary pressures  which particularly weighed on the retail business. This activity had to cope with a sharp increase in payroll costs in the UK  Germany and Switzerland.Against this backdrop  personnel expenses increased 15% to ‚Ç¨27.1 million (14.7% of total revenue versus 12.8% in 2021-2002). External expenses were also up 12% to ‚Ç¨12.2 million in 2022-2023 compared with ‚Ç¨10.9 million in 2021-2022.Other operating income and expenses also weighed on profitability at -‚Ç¨1.4 million versus ‚Ç¨0.5 million in 2021-2022. This unfavourable change includes a negative foreign exchange effect of ‚Ç¨0.6 million.Despite these items  EBITDA remained positive at ‚Ç¨1.7 million versus ‚Ç¨8.4 million a year earlier.Profit from recurring operations was negative at ‚Ç¨8.9 million  including ‚Ç¨9.6 million in depreciation  amortisation and provisions  compared with ‚Ç¨6.5 million the previous year.Taking into account the financial result  which rose from -3.0 million euros to -2.6 million euros  and tax  the Group share of consolidated net profit was a loss of 11.6 million euros  compared with a loss of 1.1 million euros the previous year.A secure financial structureAt the end of the 2022-2023 financial year  inventories were down to ‚Ç¨53.5 million compared with ‚Ç¨56.4 million for the previous financial year. The level of trade receivables was also significantly reduced to ‚Ç¨18.6 million compared with ‚Ç¨26.2 million in 2021-2002.At the end of February 2023  the Group's cash position stood at ‚Ç¨6.4 million in 2022-2023 compared with ‚Ç¨4.7 million in the previous financial year  up 35%.Finally  the Group continued its deleveraging with financial debt excluding lease debt reduced from ‚Ç¨55.3 million at end-February 2022 to ‚Ç¨53.5 million at end-February 2023.This financial situation is expected to be significantly improved in the coming months with the completion of the sale of the distribution business. As announced  the proceeds from this sale will be allocated as a priority to deleveraging and strengthening equity  which stood at ‚Ç¨27.8 million at the end of February 2023.Thus  the balance of the Boston Ltd acquisition loan  taken out in November 2019  will be fully repaid  i.e. ‚Ç¨9 million to BNP Paribas. The closing of the transaction will also lead to the expiry of the call option and the put option of 30% of the shares of the minority shareholders of Boston Ltd  as well as the additional price expected for 2022/23  valued in financial debt for an amount of ‚Ç¨13 million at the close.Outlook: confidence confirmedFor the new financial year  despite the caution imposed by the general environment  which is still mixed  2CRSi intends to accelerate its commercial transformation while maintaining strict discipline in terms of cost control and margin growth. With this in mind  refocusing on the core ‚Äúdesigner and manufacturer‚Äù business with the planned disposal of the distribution business will be a decisive driver.At the end of this transaction  a new roadmap associated with financial objectives will be presented taking into account the new scope.2CRSi also confirmed its intention to propose to the Board of Directors to submit to the Annual General Meeting for approval a special dividend of ‚Ç¨0.20 per ordinary share in order to share the proceeds of the sale of its distribution activity with all shareholders.Simplified consolidated balance sheet In millions of EUR - IFRS 28/02/2023 estimated 29/02/2022 final Goodwill 8 3 8 7 Intangible fixed assets 15 4 16 3 Tangible assets[1] 16 1 20 Non-current financial receivables 1 5 4 4 Other non-current assets 4 8 3 9 Total non-current assets 46 1 53 3 Inventories 53 3 56 4 Customers 18 6 26 2 Other current assets 17 5 16 8 Current financial receivables 7 5 5 9 Cash and cash equivalents 6 4 4 7 Total current assets 103 2 110 TOTAL ASSETS 149 3 163 4 Capital attributable to equity holders of the parent 28 9 40 5 Non-controlling interests (1) (0 3) Consolidated capital 27 8 40 3 Borrowings and financial liabilities 13 2 26 5 Non-current lease liabilities 9 9 12 3 Other non-current liabilities 3 8 3 1 Total non-current liabilities 26 8 42 Trade payables 22 6 24 8 Current financial liabilities 40 3 29 8 Current lease liabilities 2 5 3 Other current liabilities 29 4 23 5 Total current liabilities 94 7 81 1 TOTAL LIABILITIES 149 3 163 4- END -Next event: Annual General Meeting on 31 August 2023.About 2CRSiFounded in Strasbourg (France)  2CRSi group develops  produces and sells customised  high-performance and environmentally-friendly servers.

This common fire control cluster in three West European navies will facilitate international cooperation in operations and in logistics.Artist impression ASW Frigate ¬© Damen NavalCOMMIT and Thales have signed a contract for the production and delivery of the AWWS fire control cluster and sensor suite for the four new ASW Frigates that Damen Naval will build for the Belgian and Netherlands' Navies. This contract follows onthe development contract signed in 2018.Valued at several hundreds of millions of euros  this contract illustrates Thales's leading position worldwide in naval fire control and sensor technology. It will be executed by Thales's naval Centre of Excellence in Hengelo (the Netherlands).Thales will deliver the AWWS fire control cluster that continuously generates the best solution for each approaching threat in every environment. AWWS is a cutting-edge warfare suite that helps the ship's crew to counter and neutralise high-velocity and complex saturation attacks by continuously analysing and optimising the tactical environment and deployment of resources. This integrated radar and fire control system combines the information from several sensors  including radars.The new sensor suite uses Thales' latest technology based on the APAR Block 2 X-band and the SM400 Block 2 S-band radars integrated in a one-radar system that is able to reconfigure its tasks dynamically.In addition to AWWS  Thales supplies the Mirador Mk2 electro-optical fire control sensor  the Gatekeeper Mk2 electro-optic observation sensor  the Scout Mk3 low detectability naval surveillance radar as well as an extensive logistic support package.The first ship will be operational in 2029. The ASW frigates will replace the Belgian and Netherlands' multi-purpose frigates of the Karel Doorman class that are reaching the end of their lifecycle.The ships will operate in a complex multi-mission environment  with anti-submarine warfare as their main task. The frigates need to be able to independently defend themselves and other units with a state-of-the-art fire control system as above water threats are exponentially increasing in complexity  coordination and speed. Thales systems  cyber-protected by design  will protect the Dutch and Belgium frigates from sophisticated threats such as hypervelocity missiles and swarm attacks.Christophe van der Maat  Netherlands' State Secretary for Defence:""The procurement of the ASW Frigates is realized in the best possible way: through intensive cooperation between countries  armed forces and industry. The result will be an innovative and powerful weapon system. That is beneficial to us as direct users but also to Europe and NATO.""Admiral Arie Jan de Waard  commander of COMMIT: ""Thales' AWWS fits in perfectly with our priority: guaranteeing the availability of material and the safety of our personnel. The threats that this new generation of frigates may be confronted with require the support of a defence system with AI capabilities. As the navies of Belgium  the Netherlands and Germany will have the same fire control cluster on their new ships; this contract will facilitate international cooperation."" ‚ÄãArnout Damen  CEO of Damen Shipyards Group:""This is a wonderful project and a special new chapter for our Damen Naval division. We are proud to be building these beautiful frigates and look forward to working with the many  mostly Dutch  partners and suppliers on this project. With these launching customer projects  we retain vital knowledge in our own country and thus maintain our place in the world's top tier of complex naval construction. More importantly  the crews of the Dutch and Belgian navies get state-of-the-art frigates to carry out their crucial tasks.""Gerben Edelijn  CEO of Thales in the Netherlands: ""We are delighted that  once again  Thales was selected to provide the fire control capability and sensor suite for a new class of frigates for the Belgian and Royal Netherlands Navies. The crew of the ASW frigates can rely on our ultramodern Above Water Warfare System that forms an effective defence against present-day and future threats. With most Western European navies relying on Thales technology  we play a valuable role in international cooperation and the security of Europe.""About ThalesThales (Euronext Paris: HO) is a global leader in advanced technologies within three domains: Defence & Security  Aeronautics & Space  and Digital Identity & Security.

THIN¬Æ is one of Europe‚Äôs largest health databases  with the anonymized electronic health records of 69 million patients collected from general practitioners and specialists in seven European countries.An innovative approach to support the fight against cancerThis partnership aims to train Gustave Roussy‚Äôs algorithms using THIN¬Æ‚Äôs anonymized medical data collected in France and Europe by private practitioners with medical software.Gustave Roussy will be able to explore THIN¬Æ‚Äòs anonymized data for over 69 million patients in Europe (patient characteristics  clinical outcomes  and medical history going back 5+ years per patient on average) to identify factors linked with the occurrence of cancers and develop or confirm hypotheses for prevention or treatment.The approach is original because it supplements the methods Gustave Roussy already routinely uses in its genetic analyses to identify genes of interest among thousands of others.Jean-Claude Labrune  Chairman of Cegedim  declared: ‚ÄúTHIN¬Æ provides access to accurate  ethical  actionable  anonymized  longitudinal patient data from a database whose objective is still the same 30 years on  namely  to foster and support medical progress. This partnership is a huge acknowledgement for all the private practitioners in France and Europe who help create this treasure trove  which is unique in the international scientific community.‚ÄùDr. Suzette Delaloge  Director of the Interception program at Gustave Roussy  pointed out: ‚ÄúThis partnership should enable us to develop new algorithms which will help identify people at high risk of developing cancers in general practice  so together we can move towards widespread personalized cancer prevention within a few years.‚ÄùTHIN ¬Æ   a powerful and accurate European database that has been supporting research for 30 yearsTHIN¬Æ Observatory‚Äôs goal is to collect anonymous patient data for use in research on medical practices and the prescription of drugs and treatment.The THIN¬Æ real-word database was started in 1993 with the recruitment of doctors in France and the United Kingdom alongside the rapid expansion of health informatics.THIN¬Æ anonymized longitudinal data currently covers over 69 million patients in seven European countries (United Kingdom  France  Spain  Italy  Germany  Belgium and Romania).The THIN¬Æ database is built on a common data model and is available in OMOP format (EHDEN certification)  which means artificial intelligence can easily compare and use the information collected.The THIN¬Æ database is approved for use by academic institutions and health authorities in Europe (EMA / ENCePP)  the United Kingdom (NHS & NICE) and France (HAS  CEPS & ANSM)  and is cited in nearly 2 000 scientific publications.Prof. Giampiero Mazzaglia  Associate Professor of Public Health  School of Medicine and Surgery  University of Milan ‚Äì Bicocca  Italy  observed: ‚ÄúA great collaborative effort with Cegedim‚Äôs teams enabled the publication of a scientific paper on an overlooked and neglected disease like essential tremor! Once again  The Health Improvement Network database proved to be a reliable tool for improving knowledge and nurturing epidemiological and clinical research‚Äù.Dr. Anoop D. Shah  Associate Professor  UCL Institute of Health Informatics  University College London ‚Äì United Kingdom  explained: ‚ÄúWe used Cegedim‚Äôs THIN¬Æ database to carry out a detailed population-based analysis of the symptoms of Long Covid. By using the unstructured text typed by general practitioners (free text) as well as the coded information in THIN¬Æ  we were able to obtain a richer insight into patient symptoms and the pathway to a Long Covid diagnosis‚Äù.Prof. Ga√´tan Deslee  MD PHD  Pulmonology Department  University Hospital of Reims ‚Äì France  added: ‚ÄúWe used the THIN¬Æ database to conduct a study in collaboration with Cegedim's team  to analyze the use and persistence of inhaled triple therapy in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This database provides reliable data from both general practitioners and specialists allowing a better understanding of the use and persistence of treatments in a real-life context‚Äù.About THIN¬Æ: THIN¬Æ (The Health Improvement Network) is a large European database of anonymized Electronic Health Records collected at the physicians‚Äô level  owned by Cegedim Group.

The two companies will jointly explore innovative material solutions for baby feeding a‚Ä¶,"SHANGHAI  June 29  2023 /PRNewswire/ -- On June 29  leading mother and baby brand Babycare announced a strategic partnership with Belgian materials science company Solvay. The two companies will jointly explore innovative material solutions for baby feeding and nursing products  with a focus on bottles  cups and utensils. By leveraging an innovative multidisciplinary approach encompassing market demand analysis  technology sharing  and production process optimization  the collaboration envisions unlocking boundless possibilities for the market. The signing ceremony was attended by Babycare's senior director of strategic sourcing  Leo Xin  and Solvay's sales director of life solutions for Greater China  Amber Li.To date  Babycare has achieved strategic and in-depth collaborations with 19 industry leading multinational firms. The partnership with Solvay not only underscores the firm's ongoing strategic commitment to the infant nutrition sector  most notably with bottle products  but also enhances its competitive advantage in the market.Revolutionizing baby bottles and caps: Babycare invests in premium materials and collaborative innovationThrough the collaboration  Babycare will incorporate Solvay's Duradex‚Ñ¢ PPSU  a material specifically developed for transparent food-contact applications  into its range of baby products. Duradex‚Ñ¢ PPSU has obtained food contact safety certifications in China  the United States and the European Union  among other countries and regions. The material is free from harmful substances such as bisphenol A and bisphenol S. It is also compatible with various disinfection and sterilization methods  including pressure steam at 134 ¬∫C  water boiling at 100 ¬∞C and microwave sterilization  ensuring its durability during rigorous boiling disinfection processes for feeding product materials.With a 160-year history as a global leader in specialty materials  Solvay holds a prominent position in the industry  consistently ranking among the top three players in the majority of the business sectors in which it plays a role. As one of the world's largest producers of PPSU  Solvay is also the first material manufacturer to enter the Chinese food contact market. The company's influence extends to the research and development as well as innovation of PPSU materials  further cementing its industry standing.Due to its exceptional safety and stability  PPSU is highly suitable for various medical applications  including heart valves and artificial joints  making it an ideal high-end material for baby bottles and children's cups. PPSU's distinctive golden hue and a price point 30 times higher than standard PP materials earned it the nickname ""plastic gold"". Several years ago  Babycare was quick to recognize the exceptional properties of PPSU  most notably for its ability which meet the rigorous standards for feeding product materials. The firm readily embraced the material  acknowledging its unique characteristics. Since then  Babycare has predominantly utilized PPSU in the production of feeding essentials such as bottles  cups and utensils  ensuring the utmost safety and quality for babies.Babycare will collaborate closely with Solvay to explore and develop innovative materials specifically for bottles and cups. The aim is to deliver safe  professional products to Chinese infants  assuring their health and well-being.Babycare becomes China's first mother and baby brand to form a strategic partnership with SolvayOver the past few years  the Chinese baby and children product market has witnessed outstanding growth  particularly in the segments for baby bottles and children's cups. Fueled by the growing demand for premium childcare products  the need for high-quality materials has risen accordingly. At the same time  both segments have undergone rapid transformation and consolidation  leading to the emergence of definite market leaders.According to data from the data analysis firm Nint Intelligence Cloud  Babycare has  during the last two years  consistently achieved the top sales position for baby and children's cups and utensils on the platforms of Chinese e-commerce leaders  Tmall and JD.com. The remarkable achievement stands as evidence of the firm's leadership in the sector. Moreover  the company's off-center nursing bottles have successfully nourished over 700 000 babies since the product was first brought to market.""Solvay and Babycare  both champions of innovation  safety  and environmental protection  strive to enhance the quality of life through technology "" stated Mr. Xin  the Babycare senior director of strategic sourcing. ""Through the tie-up with Solvay  Babycare is committed to providing consumers with more forward-thinking  reliable products  with the aim of driving the sustainable development of the mother and baby industry.""""After conducting extensive research on the Chinese mother and baby market  Solvay forged a strategic partnership with Babycare. Both parties will increase resource investments to support the growth of the Chinese market for healthy baby products while creating a win-win situation for both companies "" added Ms. Li  Solvay sales director.The strategic partnership between Babycare and Solvay fosters extensive integration  spanning the gamut from raw materials to market expansion while reflecting their joint commitment to achieving success.Babycare's ongoing in-depth commitment to the supply chain has enabled the establishment of a robust international partner network that forms a powerful basis for innovationWith a long-term commitment to the supply chain  Babycare has built and cultivated a strong global network of raw materials suppliers  including nine strategic partners and ten collaborative partners  all of which have provided invaluable support to the company. The strategic partners  including Henkel (Germany)  Lycra (the US)  and Signify (the Netherlands)  have assured the baby bottle and cup maker a solid presence in five key markets  including Belgium  Germany  the US and the Netherlands. With an average history of over 100 years and a combined estimated annual sales revenue surpassing 800 billion yuan  these companies operate across diverse sectors  including fibers  adhesives  light source products and specialty materials. By continuously nurturing and expanding partnerships throughout the supply chain  Babycare has broadened its global network of raw material partners while  simultaneously  enhancing product quality control and fostering innovation across the upstream. The approach fosters a mutually beneficial relationship with the industry's multinational leaders.""Market demand can drive technological progress."" Babycare's growth trajectory in the mother and baby market perfect exemplifies this viewpoint. The company's expansion in the sector is a testament to its compassionate understanding of parents' concerns when it comes to feeding their infants and toddlers. By actively listening to these concerns  Babycare has gained valuable insights that have directly influenced the development of innovative products addressing those specific needs. Through collaborative research and a creative approach to its partnerships with strategic allies  Babycare has effectively overcome barriers to innovation  beginning with the sourcing of raw materials.Babycare ensures the quality of raw materials and the stability of supply through strategic partner selection  centralized procurement  and rigid quality standards. The approach enables the company to secure materials from trustworthy industry sources and flexibly adjust production capacity in line with market forecasts  strengthening the system's resilience to risks. Consequently  Babycare consistently maintains a reliable supply from its partners  even during periods of raw material shortages.Throughout the process  Babycare has successfully interconnected every stage  from sourcing raw materials to answering parents' many concerns  disrupting the traditional supply and demand relationships of the supply chain.

Given the Board's decision to propose a resolution to appoint a Liquidator to the Company and considering the Company's financial position  the Board also believes it sensible to propose a resolution to cancel the Company's admission to trading on AIM and Euronext Growth ‚Äù Barryroe Offshore Energy said Friday.If the CVL resolution is passed  Barryroe Offshore Energy will be voluntarily wound up following the appointment of the Liquidator.Cancellation of sharesUnder the AIM Rules and Euronext Growth Rules  the cancellation of shares can only take place after the expiry of a period of twenty business days from the date on which notice of the cancellation is given. In addition  a period of at least five business days following the shareholder approval of the cancellation is required before the cancellation may be put into effect. Accordingly  if the resolution to cancel the admission is approved  the cancellation will become effective at 7.00 a.m. on 1 August 2023.'Lost opportunity for Ireland'Barryroe Offshore Energy's primary focus was to progress the phased commercial development of the Barryroe oil and gas field in which it held 80% stake  with partner Lansdowne owning the remaining 20%.The Barryroe Field is located in 100 meters of water  approximately 50km offshore Cork  close to the Kinsale gas fields. Barryroe has been described as one of the largest undeveloped oil and gas fields offshore Europe and  per Barryroe Offshore Energy  has been independently assessed to potentially contain approximately 350 million barrels of recoverable oil/gas.The field may now remain undeveloped  as on June 19  Barryroe announced its intention to initiate an orderly wind-down of the business through a Creditors Voluntary Liquidation (""CVL"")  a move further affirmed on Friday.Barryroe Chairman said on June 19: ""It has been a disappointing and deeply frustrating time for shareholders  management  and the Board. In that context  the Board particularly recognizes and appreciates shareholder patience and support.‚ÄúThe funding solution put in place in November 2022 secured ‚Ç¨40 million held on deposit in escrow  ready to drawdown as needed  sufficient to fully cover the costs of the proposed appraisal program. Notwithstanding that secured funding  in assessing the Company's financial capability to deliver this commitment  the Minister has seen fit to apply his discretion  relying on reference to one  non-mandatory  'financial capability guideline'  arguably inconsistent with the limited scope of the work  thereby denying all efforts to progress appraisal of the Barryroe oil and gas field. In consequence  the country has lost an opportunity to improve Ireland's energy security  to reduce the emissions associated with importing oil and gas  to provide employment and future tax revenues and to diversify the country's sources of primary energy supply. All at no cost to the public purse.‚ÄùLansdowne Oil & Gas takes legal actionIt is worth noting that following the Irish DECC decision in May not to grant its permission for further work on the offshore block containing the Barryroe field  citing issues with the financial capability of the partners involved  Lansdowne Oil & Gas said it was considering taking legal action against the Irish government.‚Äû[Lansdowne Oil & Gas ] can advise shareholders that in recent weeks  given the considerable investment made to date by Lansdowne in the Barryroe project  the substantial potential value that the project could realize for Ireland and all stakeholders involved and the apparent lack of any progress nor any engagement by the regulatory authority  Lansdowne has been engaging with external legal counsel to assess its legal rights and the potential options available  including pursuing legal proceedings  for the purposes of protecting its investment in the Barryroe project ‚Äú the company said in May  adding that it had no choice but to formalize the engagement with external legal counsel and pursue legal proceedings to protect its investment in the Barryroe Project.Earlier this week  Lansdowne said that its legal advisors  Ashurst LLP  had submitted a letter to Ireland giving notice pursuant to Article 26(2)(c) of the Energy Charter Treaty  requiring Ireland to participate in discussions with a view to settling the dispute within three months of the date of such notice.‚ÄúReceipt of this letter has been acknowledged. Further updates will be made as appropriate  along with more information on the claims sought by Lansdowne in this matter ‚Äù Lansdowne said.Lansdowne said in May it had invested c. $20 million in the Barryroe project ‚Äùto date.‚Äù""It is with great reluctance that we must now resort to legal proceedings in relation to our investment as we would much rather have moved forward with a Lease Undertaking and appraisal drilling  for which funds had been sourced  to advance Barryroe toward development for the benefit of all stakeholders. We believe we have a very strong claim against the Irish government and the company will be resolute in defending and protecting the rights and investment of our shareholders ‚Äù Steve Boldy  CEO of Lansdowne Oil & Gas  said in May.",neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,mixed,0.11,0.07,0.82,True,English,"['Barryroe Offshore Energy', 'Irish Oil', 'Gas Project', 'Operations', 'Setback', ""one, non-mandatory, 'financial capability guideline"", 'Creditors Voluntary Liquidation', 'future tax revenues', 'additional equity capital', 'enough working capital', 'substantial potential value', 'limited working capital', 'primary energy supply', 'external legal counsel', 'twenty business days', 'five business days', 'largest undeveloped oil', 'Barryroe Offshore Energy', 'Kinsale gas fields', 'Euronext Growth Rules', 'The Barryroe Field', 'Barryroe offshore oil', 'Irish DECC decision', 'energy security', 'offshore block', 'capital raising', 'financial position', 'limited scope', 'primary focus', 'potential opti', 'Irish Department', 'Irish government', 'legal action', 'legal rights', 'Barryroe oil', 'Barryroe Chairman', 'Providence Resources', 'shareholder consent', 'Lease Undertaking', 'three weeks', 'remaining assets', 'commercial development', '350 million barrels', 'recoverable oil/gas', 'shareholder patience', 'public purse', 'recent weeks', 'considerable investment', 'apparent lack', 'regulatory authority', 'AIM Rules', 'recent decision', 'appraisal drilling', 'appraisal program', 'Barryroe project', 'partner Lansdowne', 'Lansdowne Oil', 'shareholder approval', 'Lost opportunity', 'frustrating time', 'funding solution', 'ordinary shares', 'orderly wind-down', 'gas company', 'CVL resolution', 'process', 'years', 'Ireland', 'move', 'Environment', 'Climate', 'Communications', 'application', 'completion', 'setback', 'Minister', 'June', 'Board', 'EGM', 'appointment', 'Liquidator', 'extent', 'liabilities', 'Cancellation', 'place', 'expiry', 'period', 'date', 'notice', 'effect', '7.00 a', '1 August', '80% stake', '100 meters', 'water', 'Cork', 'Europe', 'intention', 'Friday', 'disappointing', 'shareholders', 'management', 'context', 'support', 'November', 'deposit', 'escrow', 'costs', 'commitment', 'discretion', 'reference', 'efforts', 'consequence', 'country', 'emissions', 'importing', 'employment', 'May', 'permission', 'issues', 'partners', 'stakeholders', 'progress', 'engagement']",2023-06-30,2023-06-30,oedigital.com

Consequently  group supervision to move from the Dutch Central Bank (DNB) to the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA)Aegon will maintain its headquarters in the Netherlands and will remain a Dutch tax residentThe change in group supervision will have no material impact on Aegon‚Äôs capital management approachAegon to propose changes to its governance including the implementation of a one-tier board The Hague ,Aegon N.V.Aegon‚Äôs legal domicile to be transferred to Bermuda. Consequently  group supervision to move from the Dutch Central Bank (DNB) to the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA)Aegon will maintain its headquarters in the Netherlands and will remain a Dutch tax residentThe change in group supervision will have no material impact on Aegon‚Äôs capital management approachAegon to propose changes to its governance including the implementation of a one-tier boardThe Hague  June 30  2023 - Aegon today announces that it intends to move its legal seat to Bermuda. Subsequently  Aegon‚Äôs group supervision will transfer from the DNB to the BMA. Aegon will maintain its headquarters in the Netherlands  will remain a Dutch tax resident and will continue to be listed on Euronext Amsterdam and on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).Change in group supervisionFollowing the closing of the transaction with a.s.r.  Aegon will no longer have a regulated insurance business in the Netherlands. Under Solvency II rules  Aegon‚Äôs current supervisor  the DNB  can therefore no longer remain Aegon‚Äôs group supervisor. After consulting the members of the college of supervisors  the BMA has informed Aegon that the BMA would become its group supervisor if Aegon were to transfer its legal seat to Bermuda.Bermuda hosts many respected international insurance companies  including four of Aegon's subsidiaries. Bermuda‚Äôs regulatory regime is well recognized  having been granted equivalent status by the EU under the Solvency II regime  and by the UK under its own Solvency UK regime. It has also been designated as a qualified jurisdiction and reciprocal jurisdiction by the US National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). This enables insurance companies that are regulated by the BMA to easily conduct cross-border business.‚ÄúI welcome the transfer of group supervision from the DNB to the BMA ‚Äù said Lard Friese  Aegon‚Äôs CEO. ‚ÄúBermuda has an established  well-regarded regulatory regime that will facilitate the implementation of our strategy to build leaders in investment  protection and retirement solutions  as outlined at our recent Capital Markets Day.‚ÄùThe change of Aegon‚Äôs legal domicile to Bermuda will allow Aegon to maintain its headquarters in the Netherlands  remain a Dutch tax resident  and maintain its listings on Euronext Amsterdam and the NYSE.Continuity in supervision of local entities and accountingAegon‚Äôs regulated insurance entities in the US  UK  Spain  Portugal and in other jurisdictions will continue to be supervised by their current local regulators. In addition  Aegon‚Äôs asset management activities in the Netherlands will continue to be supervised by the Authority Financial Markets and the DNB.Aegon will continue to report under IFRS accounting standards. Aegon is exploring the implementation of US GAAP in the medium term  in addition to IFRS  so as to allow for better comparison against US peers  and provide long-term strategic flexibility for the Group.No material impact on Aegon‚Äôs capital management frameworkThe change in group supervision will not have a material impact on Aegon‚Äôs capital management approach  which will continue to focus on the capitalization of its operating units  Cash Capital at the Holding and gross financial leverage. Consequently  the financial targets for 2025 that Aegon provided at its recent Capital Markets Day are unchanged. Furthermore  Aegon also reconfirms its intention to initiate a EUR 1.5 billion share buyback program shortly after the closing of the transaction with a.s.r.Aegon expects its group solvency ratio and surplus under the Bermuda solvency framework to be broadly in line with that under the Solvency II framework during a transition period until the end of 2027. The method to translate Transamerica‚Äôs capital position into the group solvency position will also be similar to the current methodology. After the transition period  Aegon will fully adopt the Bermudian solvency framework.Aegon anticipates that its debt instruments that are currently grandfathered under the Solvency II regime will remain so until the end of 2025. In addition  Aegon‚Äôs debt instruments will continue to be subject to existing triggers for mandatory deferral or cancellation of interest payments or conversion into equity  based on the group solvency ratio.Aegon‚Äôs future debt structure and refinancing decisions will remain primarily driven by economic considerations  taking into account investor expectations  market circumstances  regulatory requirements  and rating agency considerations. As previously announced  Aegon intends to reduce its gross financial leverage by up to EUR 700 million following the closing of the transaction with a.s.r.Change in governanceUpon the change of the legal domicile becoming effective  Aegon N.V. will be converted into Aegon Ltd.  a Bermuda entity  and all existing assets and liabilities  rights  obligations and other legal relationships of Aegon N.V. will remain with Aegon Ltd. Aegon will adjust its governance to reflect the change in legal domicile. It will preserve Aegon‚Äôs current governance principles to the extent possible and practical in view of the redomiciliation  and where appropriate in the context of Aegon's international footprint. This includes Aegon‚Äôs commitment to take into account the long-term interests of the company and all its stakeholders. It will apply well-recognized international governance standards to reflect the international footprint of Aegon following closing of the transaction with a.s.r. The new governance includes the implementation of a one-tier board structure  comprised of both executive and non-executive directors. The governance position of  and arrangements with  Vereniging Aegon will remain materially unchanged. The proposed Aegon Ltd. governance is explained in a draft Shareholder Circular that can be found on Aegon‚Äôs website.Next stepsFollowing the closing of the transaction with a.s.r.  the change in legal domicile is subject to shareholder approval at an Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders (EGM). The Board of Vereniging Aegon has been informed of the intended change in legal domicile. The Board of Vereniging Aegon is supportive and will seek the approval from its members for their support.Aegon today has also published a draft Shareholder Circular and a conversion proposal. In addition  Aegon will today publicly file with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) a draft registration statement on Form F-4  that is substantially similar to the draft Shareholder Circular  save for certain additions required pursuant to US law  and which is to be declared effective by the SEC prior to the shareholder vote.The BMA will assume the role of group supervisor following the transfer of Aegon‚Äôs legal domicile. In the envisaged interim period between the closing of the transaction with a.s.r. and the completion of the transfer of Aegon‚Äôs legal domicile  the role of group supervisor is expected to be allocated to the Direcci√≥n General de Seguros y Fondos de Pensiones (DGSFP)  in accordance with Solvency II regulations. The DGSFP  in cooperation with the DNB  and after informing the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA)  is expected to delegate its tasks and responsibilities related to its role as group supervisor to the DNB for a period which is expected to cover the duration of this interim period.Contacts Media relations Investor relations Carolien van der Giessen Jan Willem Weidema +31(0) 6 11953367 +31(0) 70 344 8028 carolien.vandergiessen@aegon.com janwillem.weidema@aegon.comDigital media callToday at 08:00 hrs.
