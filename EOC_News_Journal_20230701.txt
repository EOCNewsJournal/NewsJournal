Europe is trying to figure out how,Russian assets frozen in European accounts could generate billions of dollars a year for rebuilding Ukraine. But can that money be used without breaching...,London CNN ‚ÄîRussian assets frozen in European accounts could generate billions of dollars a year for rebuilding Ukraine. But can that money be used without breaching international law or damaging the euro‚Äôs international standing?European Union leaders grappled with that question at a meeting of the European Council in Brussels Thursday.‚ÄúThe European Council took stock of the work done regarding Russia‚Äôs immobilized assets ‚Äù the leaders said in a statement after the meeting  adding that they would continue to work on the issue ‚Äúin accordance with EU and international law  and in coordination with partners.‚ÄùThe World Bank estimates Ukraine will need at least $411 billion to repair the damage caused by the war. And the EU and its allies are determined to make Russia foot part of the bill.One idea put forward in the EU is to draw off the interest on income generated by Russian assets while leaving the assets themselves untouched.This approach would probably deliver about ‚Ç¨3 billion ($3.3 billion) a year  according to Anders Ahnlid  the director general of the Swedish National Board of Trade and head of the EU working group looking into frozen Russian assets.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the best way of using these assets in accordance with EU and international law ‚Äù Ahnlid told CNN  noting that was also the view of lawyers at the European Commission  which has promised to propose a way to tap frozen Russian assets within weeks.‚ÄúThe Commission will come forward with a proposal and we will focus prudently on the windfall profits from the immobilized assets of the Russian central bank ‚Äù Commission president Ursula von der Leyen told reporters in Brussels Friday at the end of the two-day meeting.But some EU member states  and the European Central Bank (ECB)  have expressed concerns that even a carefully targeted plan could shake confidence in the euro as the world‚Äôs second biggest reserve currency. The EU has been at pains to contrast the illegality of Russia‚Äôs invasion with its own strict adherence to the rule of law.‚ÄúWe have to respect the principles of international law ‚Äù said a senior EU diplomat  who requested anonymity because he is not authorized to discuss closed-door meetings. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a matter of reputation  of financial stability and trust.‚ÄùThe ECB declined to comment.How it would workAfter the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February last year  EU and Group of Seven countries imposed unprecedented sanctions on Russia  freezing nearly half of its foreign reserves ‚Äî some ‚Ç¨300 billion ($327 billion) ‚Äî among other measures.Around two-thirds of that  or ‚Ç¨200 billion ($218 billion)  sits in the EU  mostly in accounts at Belgium-based Euroclear  one of the world‚Äôs largest financial clearing houses.Euroclear plays a crucial role in global markets  settling cross-border trades and safekeeping more than $40 trillion in assets.The group said in April that cash on its balance sheet had more than doubled over the year to March to stand at ‚Ç¨140 billion ($153 billion)  boosted by payments associated with frozen Russian assets  including bonds.Ordinarily  these payments would have been made to Russian bank accounts  but they have been blocked as a result of sanctions and are now themselves generating vast amounts of interest.Euroclear routinely invests such long-term cash balances and  in the first quarter  it recorded ‚Ç¨734 million ($802 million) in interest earned on cash balances from sanctioned Russian assets.The plan proposed by the EU working group would involve using a special levy to collect the windfall interest income made by Euroclear from frozen Russian assets  which would then be paid into the EU budget for the reconstruction of Ukraine.Speaking on the sidelines of Thursday‚Äôs EU meeting  Latvia‚Äôs Prime Minister Arturs Kri≈°jƒÅnis Kari≈Ü≈° said frozen Russian assets were ‚Äúlow-hanging fruit.‚Äù‚ÄúWe need to find a legal basis to utilize  mobilize these assets to help‚Ä¶ pay for the damage Russia is causing in Ukraine ‚Äù he said.Latvia's Prime Minister Arturs Kri≈°jƒÅnis Kari≈Ü≈° talks to media at the European Council summit in Brussels on June 29  2023. John Thys/AFP/Getty ImagesBut one senior EU official warned of unintended consequences  such as causing other countries or investors to worry about the safety of their assets in Europe.‚ÄúThose who have money might think ‚Ä¶.‚Äôwhat if one day  I‚Äôm on the list ‚Äô‚Äù the official  who also requested anonymity because the discussions are private  said Wednesday.One way to reduce risks to the EU would be to coordinate action with the G7. ‚ÄúI think discussion at the G7 is quite key ‚Äù the official added.Ahnlid echoed this  noting that many EU member states had stressed the importance of the bloc taking steps ‚Äúin tandem with G7 partners.‚Äù‚Äî James Frater contributed reporting.,positive,0.82,0.17,0.01,mixed,0.19,0.11,0.7,True,English,"['Russian assets', 'Ukraine', 'Europe', 'Prime Minister Arturs Kri≈°jƒÅnis Kari≈Ü≈°', 'Commission president Ursula von der Leyen', 'largest financial clearing houses', 'many EU member states', 'one senior EU official', 'Swedish National Board', 'biggest reserve currency', 'European Central Bank', 'senior EU diplomat', 'Russian central bank', 'European Council summit', 'The European Council', 'European Union leaders', 'Russian bank accounts', 'long-term cash balances', 'frozen Russian assets', 'The World Bank', 'EU working group', 'windfall interest income', 'European Commission', 'financial stability', 'One idea', 'European accounts', 'windfall profits', 'One way', 'EU budget', 'international standing', 'foot part', 'director general', 'strict adherence', 'closed-door meetings', 'The ECB', 'Seven countries', 'foreign reserves', 'other measures', 'crucial role', 'global markets', 'cross-border trades', 'balance sheet', 'vast amounts', 'first quarter', 'special levy', 'hanging fruit', 'legal basis', 'John Thys', 'AFP/Getty Images', 'unintended consequences', 'other countries', 'James Frater', 'international law', 'immobilized assets', 'best way', 'EU meeting', 'London CNN', 'two-day meeting', 'targeted plan', 'full-scale invasion', 'unprecedented sanctions', 'Anders Ahnlid', 'Belgium-based Euroclear', 'G7 partners', 'G7.', 'billions', 'dollars', 'Ukraine', 'money', 'question', 'Brussels', 'stock', 'statement', 'issue', 'accordance', 'coordination', 'damage', 'war', 'allies', 'approach', 'head', 'view', 'lawyers', 'weeks', 'proposal', 'reporters', 'concerns', 'confidence', 'second', 'pains', 'illegality', 'rule', 'principles', 'anonymity', 'matter', 'reputation', 'trust', 'February', 'half', 'two-thirds', 'April', 'year', 'March', 'payments', 'bonds', 'result', 'reconstruction', 'sidelines', 'Thursday', 'Latvia', 'media', 'June', 'investors', 'safety', 'list', 'discussions', 'risks', 'action', 'importance', 'bloc', 'steps', 'tandem', 'reporting']",2023-06-29,2023-07-01,cnn.com

In the trial the efficacy and safety of elafibranor  an investigational dual Œ± Œ¥ PPAR agonist  is being assessed for the treatment of patients with the rare cholestatic liver disease  primary biliary cholangitis (PBC)  who have an inadequate response or intolerance to the current standard of care therapy  ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA).The trial met its primary composite endpoint  with 51% of patients on elafibranor 80mg achieving a cholestasis response compared with 4% on placebo (p<0.0001). Cholestasis response is defined in the trial as alkaline phosphatase (ALP) <1.67 x upper limit of normal (ULN)  an ALP decrease ‚â• 15 percent and total bilirubin (TB) ‚â§ ULN at 52 weeks. ALP and bilirubin are important predictors of disease progression. Reductions in levels of both can indicate reduced cholestatic injury and improved liver function.The first secondary endpoint  normalization of ALP at Week 52  was also met with statistically significant improvements for investigational elafibranor compared with placebo. For the other secondary endpoint  a trend for pruritus improvement was observed with a greater decrease from baseline in the PBC Worst Itch NRS score for patients on elafibranor compared to placebo  which did not reach statistical significance. In the study  elafibranor was generally well tolerated with a safety profile consistent with that observed in previously reported studies.‚ÄúThese are encouraging results that suggest elafibranor could be an effective treatment to prevent progression of PBC in patients who have received UDCA. It has a good safety profile and was well- tolerated  and could provide an important new therapeutic option for long-term treatment of patients with this debilitating condition ‚Äù said Howard Mayer  Executive Vice President and Head of Research and Development for Ipsen. ‚ÄúPBC is a serious condition which  if not treated properly  can lead to progression of liver disease and ultimately liver failure. We are excited about the potential of this investigational treatment and Ipsen now intends to discuss these results with regulatory agencies and plans to move forward with regulatory submissions to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency.‚Äù‚ÄúWe are pleased by these results because PBC remains a disease where significant unmet medical needs exist‚Äù  added Pascal Prigent  Chief Executive Officer of GENFIT. ‚ÄúThis long-awaited trial outcome is therefore good news for patients and for healthcare professionals who need more options to improve the clinical management of patients with PBC. It is also a gratifying recognition of the quality of our team‚Äôs work and of GENFIT‚Äôs ability to innovate and deliver tangible results.‚ÄùPBC is a rare  progressive  autoimmune cholestatic liver disease1 in which bile ducts in the liver are gradually destroyed. The damage to bile ducts can inhibit the liver‚Äôs ability to rid the body of toxins  and can lead to scarring of liver tissue  known as cirrhosis.1 Common symptoms of PBC include fatigue and pruritus (itch)  which can be severely debilitating.1 Untreated  PBC can lead to liver failure  or in some cases death. It is also a leading cause of liver transplantation. It primarily affects middle-aged women  with nine women diagnosed for every man. It is a disease where a significant proportion of patients are unable to benefit from existing therapies. The prevalence of people living with PBC is estimated to be between 23.9-39.2 per 100 000 in the U. S2 3and 22.27 per 100 000 in Europe.4ELATIVE¬Æ is a multi-center  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trial  with an open-label long-term extension (NCT03124108). ELATIVE¬Æ is evaluating the efficacy and safety of elafibranor 80mg once daily versus placebo for the treatment of patients with PBC with an inadequate response or intolerance to UDCA  the existing first-line therapy for PBC. The trial enrolled 161 patients who were randomized 2:1 to receive elafibranor 80mg once daily or placebo. Patients with an inadequate response to UDCA would continue to receive UDCA in combination with elafibranor or placebo  while patients unable to tolerate UDCA would receive only elafibranor or placebo.Full data from the ELATIVE¬Æ trial will be presented at a future scientific congress.GENFIT will host a conference call on June 30  2023 at 8:00am ET / 1:00pm GMT / 2:00pm CET in English and in FrenchBoth the English and French conference calls will be accessible on the investor page of our website  under the events section at https://ir.genfit.com/ or by calling 888-394-8218 (toll-free U.S. and Canada)  0800 279 0425 (toll-free UK) or 0805 101 219 (France) five minutes prior to the start time (confirmation code: 6752821).

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen‚Äôs future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‚Äòbelieves‚Äô  ‚Äòanticipates‚Äô and ‚Äòexpects‚Äô and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen‚Äôs expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen‚Äôs patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen‚Äôs activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen‚Äôs partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen‚Äôs business  financial position or performance.

Subsequently  Aegon‚Äôs group supervision will transfer from the DNB to the BMA. Aegon will maintain its headquarters in the Netherlands  will remain a Dutch tax‚Ä¶,Aegon‚Äôs legal domicile to be transferred to Bermuda. Consequently  group supervision to move from the Dutch Central Bank (DNB) to the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA)Aegon will maintain its headquarters in the Netherlands and will remain a Dutch tax residentThe change in group supervision will have no material impact on Aegon‚Äôs capital management approachAegon to propose changes to its governance including the implementation of a one-tier boardThe Hague  June 30  2023 - Aegon today announces that it intends to move its legal seat to Bermuda. Subsequently  Aegon‚Äôs group supervision will transfer from the DNB to the BMA. Aegon will maintain its headquarters in the Netherlands  will remain a Dutch tax resident and will continue to be listed on Euronext Amsterdam and on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).Change in group supervisionFollowing the closing of the transaction with a.s.r.  Aegon will no longer have a regulated insurance business in the Netherlands. Under Solvency II rules  Aegon‚Äôs current supervisor  the DNB  can therefore no longer remain Aegon‚Äôs group supervisor. After consulting the members of the college of supervisors  the BMA has informed Aegon that the BMA would become its group supervisor if Aegon were to transfer its legal seat to Bermuda.Bermuda hosts many respected international insurance companies  including four of Aegon's subsidiaries. Bermuda‚Äôs regulatory regime is well recognized  having been granted equivalent status by the EU under the Solvency II regime  and by the UK under its own Solvency UK regime. It has also been designated as a qualified jurisdiction and reciprocal jurisdiction by the US National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). This enables insurance companies that are regulated by the BMA to easily conduct cross-border business.‚ÄúI welcome the transfer of group supervision from the DNB to the BMA ‚Äù said Lard Friese  Aegon‚Äôs CEO. ‚ÄúBermuda has an established  well-regarded regulatory regime that will facilitate the implementation of our strategy to build leaders in investment  protection and retirement solutions  as outlined at our recent Capital Markets Day.‚ÄùThe change of Aegon‚Äôs legal domicile to Bermuda will allow Aegon to maintain its headquarters in the Netherlands  remain a Dutch tax resident  and maintain its listings on Euronext Amsterdam and the NYSE.Continuity in supervision of local entities and accountingAegon‚Äôs regulated insurance entities in the US  UK  Spain  Portugal and in other jurisdictions will continue to be supervised by their current local regulators. In addition  Aegon‚Äôs asset management activities in the Netherlands will continue to be supervised by the Authority Financial Markets and the DNB.Aegon will continue to report under IFRS accounting standards. Aegon is exploring the implementation of US GAAP in the medium term  in addition to IFRS  so as to allow for better comparison against US peers  and provide long-term strategic flexibility for the Group.No material impact on Aegon‚Äôs capital management frameworkThe change in group supervision will not have a material impact on Aegon‚Äôs capital management approach  which will continue to focus on the capitalization of its operating units  Cash Capital at the Holding and gross financial leverage. Consequently  the financial targets for 2025 that Aegon provided at its recent Capital Markets Day are unchanged. Furthermore  Aegon also reconfirms its intention to initiate a EUR 1.5 billion share buyback program shortly after the closing of the transaction with a.s.r.Aegon expects its group solvency ratio and surplus under the Bermuda solvency framework to be broadly in line with that under the Solvency II framework during a transition period until the end of 2027. The method to translate Transamerica‚Äôs capital position into the group solvency position will also be similar to the current methodology. After the transition period  Aegon will fully adopt the Bermudian solvency framework.Aegon anticipates that its debt instruments that are currently grandfathered under the Solvency II regime will remain so until the end of 2025. In addition  Aegon‚Äôs debt instruments will continue to be subject to existing triggers for mandatory deferral or cancellation of interest payments or conversion into equity  based on the group solvency ratio.Aegon‚Äôs future debt structure and refinancing decisions will remain primarily driven by economic considerations  taking into account investor expectations  market circumstances  regulatory requirements  and rating agency considerations. As previously announced  Aegon intends to reduce its gross financial leverage by up to EUR 700 million following the closing of the transaction with a.s.r.Change in governanceUpon the change of the legal domicile becoming effective  Aegon N.V. will be converted into Aegon Ltd.  a Bermuda entity  and all existing assets and liabilities  rights  obligations and other legal relationships of Aegon N.V. will remain with Aegon Ltd. Aegon will adjust its governance to reflect the change in legal domicile. It will preserve Aegon‚Äôs current governance principles to the extent possible and practical in view of the redomiciliation  and where appropriate in the context of Aegon's international footprint. This includes Aegon‚Äôs commitment to take into account the long-term interests of the company and all its stakeholders. It will apply well-recognized international governance standards to reflect the international footprint of Aegon following closing of the transaction with a.s.r. The new governance includes the implementation of a one-tier board structure  comprised of both executive and non-executive directors. The governance position of  and arrangements with  Vereniging Aegon will remain materially unchanged. The proposed Aegon Ltd. governance is explained in a draft Shareholder Circular that can be found on Aegon‚Äôs website.Next stepsFollowing the closing of the transaction with a.s.r.  the change in legal domicile is subject to shareholder approval at an Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders (EGM). The Board of Vereniging Aegon has been informed of the intended change in legal domicile. The Board of Vereniging Aegon is supportive and will seek the approval from its members for their support.Aegon today has also published a draft Shareholder Circular and a conversion proposal. In addition  Aegon will today publicly file with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) a draft registration statement on Form F-4  that is substantially similar to the draft Shareholder Circular  save for certain additions required pursuant to US law  and which is to be declared effective by the SEC prior to the shareholder vote.The BMA will assume the role of group supervisor following the transfer of Aegon‚Äôs legal domicile. In the envisaged interim period between the closing of the transaction with a.s.r. and the completion of the transfer of Aegon‚Äôs legal domicile  the role of group supervisor is expected to be allocated to the Direcci√≥n General de Seguros y Fondos de Pensiones (DGSFP)  in accordance with Solvency II regulations. The DGSFP  in cooperation with the DNB  and after informing the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA)  is expected to delegate its tasks and responsibilities related to its role as group supervisor to the DNB for a period which is expected to cover the duration of this interim period.Contacts Media relations Investor relations Carolien van der Giessen Jan Willem Weidema +31(0) 6 11953367 +31(0) 70 344 8028 carolien.vandergiessen@aegon.com janwillem.weidema@aegon.comDigital media callToday at 08:00 hrs.

The approval of VYVGART in China marks an important milestone for patients and provides physicians with a novel  safe and effective therapy to help improve the quality of life for those in their care ‚Äù said Dr. Chongbo Zhao  M.D.  Ph.D.  Deputy Director of Department of Neurology  Huashan Hospital Affiliated to Fudan University  Director of Working Group of Huashan Rare Disease Center. ‚ÄúIn clinical studies  efgartigimod demonstrated outstanding characteristics in terms of onset of action  efficacy  and safety  helping to improve patients' muscle strength and quality of life. VYVGART  the first-and-only approved FcRn antagonist for gMG patients in China  has the potential to revolutionize the treatment landscape for gMG patients in China and we are grateful to Zai Lab for providing the support for these patients who have been devastated by this disease for so long.‚ÄùThe global Phase 3 ADAPT trial met its primary endpoint  demonstrating that significantly more anti-AChR antibody positive gMG patients were responders on the Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) scale following treatment with efgartigimod compared with placebo (68% vs. 30%; p<0.0001). Responders were defined as having at least a two-point reduction on the MG-ADL scale sustained for four or more consecutive weeks during the first treatment cycle2.There were also significantly more responders on the Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) scale following treatment with efgartigimod compared with placebo (63% vs. 14%; p<0.0001). Responders were defined as having at least a three-point reduction on the QMG scale sustained for four or more consecutive weeks during the first treatment cycle.VYVGART demonstrated a well-tolerated safety profile in the ADAPT clinical trial. The most commonly reported adverse reactions that occurred more frequently with VYVGART than placebo were upper respiratory tract infections (10.7% following treatment with efgartigimod vs. 4.8% of placebo) and urinary tract infections (9.5% vs. 4.8%).About VYVGARTVYVGART is a human IgG1 antibody fragment that binds to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)  resulting in the reduction of circulating IgG autoantibodies. It is the first approved FcRn blocker in the United States  EU and China for the treatment of adults with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive  and in Japan for the treatment of adults with gMG who do not have sufficient response to steroids or non-steroidal immunosuppressive therapies (ISTs).Zai Lab has an exclusive license agreement with argenx to develop and commercialize efgartigimod in mainland China  Hong Kong  Macau  and Taiwan (Greater China).About Myasthenia Gravis in ChinaMyasthenia gravis (MG) is a chronic autoimmune disease  characterized by debilitating and potentially life-threatening muscle weakness. There are approximately 200 000 people in China living with the disease1. More than 85% of people with MG progress to gMG within 18 months; in this generalized form of the disease  skeletal muscles throughout the body may be affected  resulting in weakness and early fatigue. Difficulties with double vision  facial expression  speech  swallowing  and ambulation are frequent and difficult to manage for patients and treating physicians. In more life-threatening cases  gMG can affect the muscles responsible for breathing  which can be fatal. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors  steroids  immunosuppressants  and IVIg are the mainstay of treatment in China. However  there is a lack of high-level evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of MG  representing significant unmet needs.1 Nationwide population-based epidemiological study of myasthenia gravis in Taiwan  2010.2 Howard JF et al.

Under this project  founded by four local public authorities from the Tours area[1] and STMicroelectronics Tours ‚Äì to decarbonise heavy transport and industry ‚Äì Lhyfe will build a green and renewable hydrogen production site  while Ter√©ga Solutions will operate the distribution infrastructure. The innovative and ambitious Hy'Touraine project  which is supported by a ‚Ç¨3.4 million ADEME grant for the gradual deployment of the infrastructure  aims to produce up to two tonnes of renewable hydrogen a day.A strategic location and a modular project designed to develop and incorporate new partnersThe strategically located Isoparc industrial estate in Sorigny  just off the A10 motorway  was selected as the location for the future renewable hydrogen production plant. The site  which has already been home to the Centre region's first hydrogen fuel station since 2019  will welcome the first hydrogen production unit powered by renewable energy that will be supplied by the local power operator  the SIEL (Syndicat Intercommunal d'Energie d'Indre et Loire)  and its renewable energy company EnER Centre Val de Loire.The unit will be flexible and modular to allow for development and the integration of the ecosystem's future needs and demands. With an installed capacity of 5MW  it will be able to produce up to two tonnes of H2 a day  depending on needs.It will be used to meet both industrial needs and mobility requirements via two refuelling stations. Hydrogen needs have been identified among numerous local authorities (e.g. Tours M√©tropole Val de Loire  Communaut√© de Communes Touraine Vall√©e de l'Indre  Conseil D√©partemental de Touraine  etc.) as well as public and private companies of which STMicroelectronics Tours  which have indicated that they wish to develop this solution for the decarbonisation of heavy transport and industry in the area. On the industry side  STMicroelectronics Tours could use this locally produced renewable hydrogen to support its industrial development of GaN or gallium nitride technology  which requires hydrogen for its production. Using renewable hydrogen would also help it to achieve its goal of being carbon neutral by 2027. The involvement of STMicroelectronics Tours will promote local economic development by providing the Hy'Touraine project with an immediate commercial outlet.The Hy'Touraine project was selected under the Territorial Hydrogen Ecosystems call for projects by ADEME which will provide a ‚Ç¨3.4 million grant for the gradual deployment of the infrastructure and user acquisitions  such as the waste collection trucks of the Tours M√©tropole Val de Loire conurbation.For an interview with the spokespersons above  please contact the press department.Click to access the Lhyfe Media Kit (press kit and visuals)About LhyfeLhyfe is a European group devoted to energy transition  and a producer and supplier of green and renewable hydrogen.

In the trial the efficacy and safety of elafibranor  an investigational dual Œ± Œ¥ PPAR agonist  is being assessed for the treatment of patients with the rare cholestatic liver disease  primary biliary cholangitis (PBC)  who have an inadequate response or intolerance to the current standard of care therapy  ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA).The trial met its primary composite endpoint  with 51% of patients on elafibranor 80mg achieving a cholestasis response compared with 4% on placebo (p<0.0001). Cholestasis response is defined in the trial as alkaline phosphatase (ALP) <1.67 x upper limit of normal (ULN)  an ALP decrease ‚â• 15 percent and total bilirubin (TB) ‚â§ ULN at 52 weeks. ALP and bilirubin are important predictors of disease progression. Reductions in levels of both can indicate reduced cholestatic injury and improved liver function.The first secondary endpoint  normalization of ALP at Week 52  was also met with statistically significant improvements for investigational elafibranor compared with placebo. For the other secondary endpoint  a trend for pruritus improvement was observed with a greater decrease from baseline in the PBC Worst Itch NRS score for patients on elafibranor compared to placebo  which did not reach statistical significance. In the study  elafibranor was generally well tolerated with a safety profile consistent with that observed in previously reported studies.‚ÄúThese are encouraging results that suggest elafibranor could be an effective treatment to prevent progression of PBC in patients who have received UDCA. It has a good safety profile and was well-tolerated and could provide an important new therapeutic option for long-term treatment of patients with this debilitating condition ‚Äù said Howard Mayer  Executive Vice President and Head of Research and Development for Ipsen. ‚ÄúPBC is a serious condition  which if not treated properly can lead to progression of liver disease and ultimately liver failure. We are excited about the potential of this investigational treatment and Ipsen now intends to discuss these results with regulatory agencies and plans to move forward with regulatory submissions to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency.‚Äù‚ÄúWe are pleased by these results because PBC remains a disease where significant unmet medical needs exist ‚Äù added Pascal Prigent  Chief Executive Officer of GENFIT. ‚ÄúThis long-awaited trial outcome is therefore good news for patients and for healthcare professionals who need more options to improve the clinical management of patients with PBC. It is also a gratifying recognition of the quality of our team‚Äôs work and of GENFIT‚Äôs ability to innovate and deliver tangible results.‚ÄùPBC is a rare  progressive  autoimmune cholestatic liver disease1 in which bile ducts in the liver are gradually destroyed. The damage to bile ducts can inhibit the liver‚Äôs ability to rid the body of toxins  and can lead to scarring of liver tissue  known as cirrhosis.1 Common symptoms of PBC include fatigue and pruritus (itch)  which can be severely debilitating.1 Untreated  PBC can lead to liver failure  or in some cases death. It is also a leading cause of liver transplantation. It primarily affects middle-aged women  with nine women diagnosed for every man. It is a disease where a significant proportion of patients are unable to benefit from existing therapies. The prevalence of people living with PBC is estimated to be between 23.9-39.2 per 100 000 in the U.S2 3 and 22.27 per 100 000 in Europe.4ELATIVE is a multi-center  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trial  with an open-label long-term extension (NCT03124108). ELATIVE is evaluating the efficacy and safety of elafibranor 80mg once daily versus placebo for the treatment of patients with PBC with an inadequate response or intolerance to UDCA  the existing first-line therapy for PBC. The trial enrolled 161 patients who were randomized 2:1 to receive elafibranor 80mg once daily or placebo. Patients with an inadequate response to UDCA would continue to receive UDCA in combination with elafibranor or placebo  while patients unable to tolerate UDCA would receive only elafibranor or placebo.Full data from the ELATIVE trial will be presented at a future scientific congress.ENDSAbout elafibranorElafibranor is a novel  oral  once-daily  dual peroxisome activated receptor (PPAR) alpha/delta (Œ± Œ¥) agonist  currently under investigation as a treatment for patients with PBC  a rare liver disease.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen‚Äôs future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‚Äòbelieves‚Äô  ‚Äòanticipates‚Äô and ‚Äòexpects‚Äô and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen‚Äôs expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen‚Äôs patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen‚Äôs activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen‚Äôs partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen‚Äôs business  financial position or performance.

And the division has prepared a vibe shift to go along with that structural change  creating bold employee NFTs in collaboration with the Dfinity Foundation and NFT marketplace Yumi via the Internet Computer blockchain.ADADDubbed ‚ÄúThe X Collection ‚Äù the artwork was created by US-based applied artist Candace Marquette and depicts digitally rendered people and animals. A Yumi blog post says the collection is inspired by six types of natural elements‚Äîclouds  land  water  light  air  and fire.Artwork from Pluxee's X Collection project. Image: PluxeeBroadly  Sodexo provides a range of services  including school and workplace food services and facilities and workplace management. It is publicly listed on the Euronext Paris and serves 100 million consumers daily  per its website  with some 422 000 employees and annual revenue topping 21 billion euros the last fiscal year.The Pluxee division provides benefit initiatives for employees at an array of companies‚Äîsome 500 000 firms utilize the service  Pluxee says  servicing over 36 million users with things like meal cards and wellness programs. Pluxee itself has about 5 000 employees.Pluxee‚Äôs project is made up of 5 000 digital collectibles‚ÄîNFTs inspired by the 31 countries the company currently operates in. The brand said in a press release the initiative is a demonstration of its ‚Äúbelief in cutting-edge technology.‚ÄùAt the moment  the main utility is the digital assets‚Äô use as a profile picture for Pluxee‚Äôs own employees. But it may also be intended as a showcase of what‚Äôs possible for companies that Pluxee serves  with the firm saying in a release that it ‚Äúmarks a new use case for NFTs as tools to increase employee engagement and enrich company culture.‚Äù‚ÄúAt Pluxee  we‚Äôre committed to creating personalized and sustainable experiences  and these unique NFTs served this purpose perfectly ‚Äù said Suvodeep Das  Sodexo‚Äôs Global VP Multi-Benefits & Gift  via email. He added that the reveal created ‚Äúa lot of excitement‚Äù among employees.‚ÄúThroughout our teams  employees are now using these Pluxee-branded NFTs across multiple touchpoints and their own personal social networks ‚Äù said Das.Pluxee‚Äôs employees are able to trade the digital collectibles among their peers and transfer the assets into their own wallets. Das said he does not expect them to have resale value  however  and did not outline any future utility.ADADPluxee said it chose to partner with developer Dfinity and use the Internet Computer blockchain because of its energy efficiency and commitment to sustainability. As part of the drop  the company committed to donating ‚Ç¨1 per NFT claimed‚Äîfor a potential maximum of ‚Ç¨5 000  or about $5 440‚Äîto its Stop Hunger charity initiative.It isn‚Äôt the first time Sodexo‚Äôs rewards brand has dabbled in blockchain. The business already offers a blockchain-based employee benefits solution in Chile and Uruguay  which the company called ‚Äúthe first of its kind‚Äù in the employee benefits sector.This corporate drop marks the latest example of multinationals taking notice of Web3 tech  as mainstream brands continue to dip their toes in Web3 waters in the hope of finding new ways to engage consumers. Others have done it in a more customer-facing way.Coffee conglomerate Starbucks set up its crypto stall with an NFT-based rewards program called Starbucks Odyssey on Ethereum sidechain network Polygon  and has sold limited edition NFT collectibles to users.

Dematerialised shares do not benefit from the double voting right. The method used by VGP to calculate the holding period of two consecutive years is the LIFO (""last in  first out"") method  i.e.: for the same registered shareholder  the shares that the latter has most recently acquired are the first shares that will be deducted from his total amount of registered shares if he/she transfers shares to a third party. Any share converted into a dematerialised share or the ownership of which is transferred loses the double voting right as from its dematerialisation or entry of its transfer in VGP‚Äôs share register. It is therefore important that VGP be kept informed of any transfer of registered shares by the transferor and/or the transferee promptly at the time of each transfer in order to enable VGP to keep its register of registered shares and  consequently  the number of registered shares with double voting rights up to date.ABOUT VGPVGP is a pan-European owner  manager and developer of high-quality logistics and semi-industrial real estate.

Acquisition of the business unit of Bewow S.r.l. with the Gooimp and Mood Concept Store brands Talea's Board of Directors resolved to acquire the business unit of Bewow S.r.l. - a company retailing any type of product for personal care and wellness at home (""Bewow"")  also online - and to sign the related sale agreement (the ""Transaction""). The business unit consists of  inter alia  the GOOIMP brand  a brand operating in the marketing of personal care and hygiene products  and the MOOD CONCEPT STORE brand (""MOOD"")  a brand operating in the Italian furniture & home living sector through the website https://www.moodconceptstore.com  a physical shop  and projects for special supplies (Contract business). The acquisition is part of the Group's new development strategy which  in line with the 2023 - 2025 Business Plan and the rebranding to Talea Group  envisages continuing on the path of growth through acquisitions of targets in cross-border markets  with the aim of expanding the product offering in the area of goods and services for personal well-being. The Business Plan disclosed to the market on 28 March forecasts revenues of between EUR 220 and 230 million by 2025  with an ebitda of EUR 13-14 million  and a sustainable ebitda margin in the long term of around 6%. GOOIMP (an acronym for ""Good Impression"") is a new brand that produces a line of supplements and cosmetics based on specific ingredients and natural formulas. Gooimp's natural products come in sustainable  100% recyclable  100% Made in Italy packaging  designed not only to improve people's wellbeing but also in full respect of the environment. In the new line of Gooimp supplements  extreme attention has been paid to the efficacy of the active ingredients through a careful selection of the best raw materials that have made it possible  through constant research at all stages of production  to market innovative products that evolve with the new and ongoing needs of consumers. All Gooimp supplements are gluten-free and most are lactose-free and suitable for vegans.The new Gooimp cosmetics line follows the ""clean"" philosophy  with a list of essential ingredients made in Italy and with up to 99% natural ingredients.

Gooimp cosmetics are also sustainable for the environment: highly natural and essential formulas in 100% recyclable packaging. MOOD operates in the Furniture & Home Living sector  an industry that in 2022 reported a value of approximately EUR 24.8 billion (online + offline)  +14% compared to 2021  of which approximately EUR 3.9 billion through e-commerce (+14% YoY).

MOOD generated revenue of approximately EUR 0.8 million in 2022 and the website has over 5 000 registered users. Talea's brand development capabilities - thanks to its digital expertise  as proven by the acquisition of the Farmaeurope brand - should allow MOOD to grow strongly in a market with high potential and margins. The Transaction qualifies as a related party transaction pursuant to the provisions on related parties issued by Borsa Italiana S.p.A. on 25 October 2021 as well as Consob Regulation No. 17221 of 12 March 2010  as last amended by resolution No. 22144 of 22 December 2021  as Riccardo Iacometti is at the same time sole shareholder and sole director of Bewow and controlling shareholder (albeit indirectly)  Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer of Talea . The resolution of the Board of Directors was therefore taken after the Related Party Transaction Committee (the ""RPT Committee"")  which also met today  expressed a favourable  unanimous non-binding opinion on Talea's interest in carrying out the Transaction  as well as on the economic convenience and substantial and procedural fairness of the Transaction. The Transaction appears to be of ""minor significance"" under the RPT Procedure and  therefore  it was not necessary to publish an information document pursuant to the RPT Procedure itself. Immediately following the Board of Directors' meeting  Talea  Bewow and Riccardo Iacometti signed the preliminary sale and purchase agreement governing the terms and conditions of the Transaction. In this regard  the Transaction provides for the sale of Bewow's business unit to Talea for an equity consideration of maximum Euro 1 900 000  of which: a fixed component equal to Euro 1 100 000  without any adjustment  to be paid by the Company to Bewow (a) for Euro 200 000  upon the closing of the Transaction and (b) for the remaining part  equal to Euro 900 000  no later than 30 June 2024; and a variable portion  by way of earn-out  of Euro 800 000 to be paid by the Company to Bewow (no later than 30 June 2025) only in the event that the portion of the Company's 2024 turnover generated by the brands of the acquired business unit is equal to or greater than Euro 3 000 000. The price was set taking into account  inter alia  the results of the valuation of the business unit carried out by an independent expert appointed by the Company. The Transaction also provides for a set of representations and warranties issued by Bewow  which are standard for this type of transaction (with consequent indemnification obligations for Bewow and its sole shareholder Riccardo Iacometti  jointly and severally  as well as for Riccardo Iacometti alone in the event that Bewow is put into liquidation before the expiry of the term of the representations and warranties contractuallyprovided for) and non-competition undertakings for a period of 36 months from the date of execution of the Transaction. The execution of the Transaction  which is not subject to any conditions  is expected to take place by mid-July. In connection with the Transaction  the Company was assisted in legal matters by Pedersoli with a team comprised of Francesca Leverone and Elisa Bertoni. Notary for the Transaction is Notary Agata Capo. Short-Term Cash Incentive Plan - MBO Plan 2023 The aim of the MBO Plan 2023 is to link the remuneration of Talea's key resources to the Group's actual economic performance and the creation of value for the same; to align the interests of the Company's key resources with those of the shareholders; to introduce retention policies aimed at fostering the loyalty of key resources and incentivising their continued employment in the Company. The beneficiaries of the MBO Plan 2023 - which lasts for 1 year - are the managers directly reporting to the CEO  the directors (executive and non-executive) as well as any other top managers and strategic employees. Today  the Board of Directors identified among the beneficiaries the Chairman and CEO Riccardo Iacometti  the Company's directors Alberto Maglione and Marco Di Filippo  the director of the subsidiary Valnan S.r.l. Marco Maglione (brother of board member Alberto Maglione)  Company executives Cinzia Rossi and Andrea Iacometti (respectively  spouse and son of Chairman Iacometti)  3 other executives and 43 employees. The beneficiaries will receive a cash bonus provided that the specific targets set for the individual beneficiary and a specific Talea Group EBITDA target for the year 2023 are achieved  according to the terms and conditions outlined in the relevant Regulation. The amount payable under the MBO Plan 2023 is between Euro 0 (in the event that each target is not reached by all beneficiaries)  Euro 614 655 (in the event that all targets are reached ""on target"") and Euro 1 229 311 (in the event that all beneficiaries exceed the maximum targets). Since certain beneficiaries of the MBO Plan 2023 are ""related parties"" of the Company  the approval of the MBO Plan 2023 constitutes a ""transaction with related parties""  albeit of ""minor significance""  pursuant to the provisions on related parties issued by Borsa Italiana S.p.A. on 25 October 2021 as well as Consob Regulation No. 17221 of 12 March 2010  as most recently amended by resolution No. 22144 of 22 December 2021. The resolution of the Board of Directors was therefore taken after the Related Party Transaction Committee  which also met today  expressed a favourable  unanimous non-binding opinion on Talea's interest in approving the MBO Plan 2023  as well as on the economic convenience and substantial and procedural correctness of the same.

With around 60% of the drag from higher Bank of England rates yet to be felt  the economy will likely tip into a recession in the second half of this year  involving a GDP fall overall of around 0.5%  he says. Looking ahead  as government support fades  real household incomes are unlikely to grow by much this year  and with households' stock of pandemic savings well below the pre-pandemic trend in real terms  they are likely to be a less powerful support for spending  Webb adds.

Aegonplein 50 2591 TV THE HAGUE The NetherlandsAegon's press release  dated June 30  2023  is included as appendix and incorporated herein by reference. SIGNATURE Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934  the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned  thereunto duly authorized. Aegon N.V. (Registrant) Date: June 30  2023 By /s/ J.O. van Klinken J.O. van Klinken Executive Vice President and General CounselJune 30  2023 Press release Aegon's group supervision to transfer from Dutch Central Bank to Bermuda Monetary Authority ‚Ä¢ Aegon's legal domicile to be transferred to Bermuda. Consequently  group supervision to move from the Dutch Central Bank (DNB) to the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA) ‚Ä¢ Aegon will maintain its headquarters in the Netherlands and will remain a Dutch tax resident ‚Ä¢ The change in group supervision will have no material impact on Aegon's capital management approach ‚Ä¢ Aegon to propose changes to its governance including the implementation of a one-tier board Aegon today announces that it intends to move its legal seat to Bermuda. Subsequently  Aegon's group supervision will transfer from the DNB to the BMA. Aegon will maintain its headquarters in the Netherlands  will remain a Dutch tax resident and will continue to be listed on Euronext Amsterdam and on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Change in group supervision Following the closing of the transaction with a.s.r.  Aegon will no longer have a regulated insurance business in the Netherlands. Under Solvency II rules  Aegon's current supervisor  the DNB  can therefore no longer remain Aegon's group supervisor. After consulting the members of the college of supervisors  the BMA has informed Aegon that the BMA would become its group supervisor if Aegon were to transfer its legal seat to Bermuda. Bermuda hosts many respected international insurance companies  including four of Aegon's subsidiaries. Bermuda's regulatory regime is well recognized  having been granted equivalent status by the EU under the Solvency II regime  and by the UK under its own Solvency UK regime. It has also been designated as a qualified jurisdiction and reciprocal jurisdiction by the US National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). This enables insurance companies that are regulated by the BMA to easily conduct cross-border business. ""I welcome the transfer of group supervision from the DNB to the BMA "" said Lard Friese  Aegon's CEO. ""Bermuda has an established  well-regarded regulatory regime that will facilitate the implementation of our strategy to build leaders in investment  protection and retirement solutions  as outlined at our recent Capital Markets Day."" The change of Aegon's legal domicile to Bermuda will allow Aegon to maintain its headquarters in the Netherlands  remain a Dutch tax resident  and maintain its listings on Euronext Amsterdam and the NYSE. Continuity in supervision of local entities and accounting Aegon's regulated insurance entities in the US  UK  Spain  Portugal and in other jurisdictions will continue to be supervised by their current local regulators. In addition  Aegon's asset management activities in the Netherlands will continue to be supervised by the Authority Financial Markets and the DNB. Aegon will continue to report under IFRS accounting standards. Aegon is exploring the implementation of US GAAP in the medium term  in addition to IFRS  so as to allow for better comparison against US peers  and provide long-term strategic flexibility for the Group. No material impact on Aegon's capital management framework The change in group supervision will not have a material impact on Aegon's capital management approach  which will continue to focus on the capitalization of its operating units  Cash Capital at the Holding and gross financial leverage. Consequently  the financial targets for 2025 that Aegon provided at its recent Capital Markets Day are unchanged. Furthermore  Aegon also reconfirms its intention to initiate a EUR 1.5 billion share buyback program shortly after the closing of the transaction with a.s.r.June 30  2023 Press release Aegon expects its group solvency ratio and surplus under the Bermuda solvency framework to be broadly in line with that under the Solvency II framework during a transition period until the end of 2027. The method to translate Transamerica's capital position into the group solvency position will also be similar to the current methodology. After the transition period  Aegon will fully adopt the Bermudian solvency framework. Aegon anticipates that its debt instruments that are currently grandfathered under the Solvency II regime will remain so until the end of 2025. In addition  Aegon's debt instruments will continue to be subject to existing triggers for mandatory deferral or cancellation of interest payments or conversion into equity  based on the group solvency ratio. Aegon's future debt structure and refinancing decisions will remain primarily driven by economic considerations  taking into account investor expectations  market circumstances  regulatory requirements  and rating agency considerations. As previously announced  Aegon intends to reduce its gross financial leverage by up to EUR 700 million following the closing of the transaction with a.s.r. Change in governance Upon the change of the legal domicile becoming effective  Aegon N.V. will be converted into Aegon Ltd.  a Bermuda entity  and all existing assets and liabilities  rights  obligations and other legal relationships of Aegon N.V. will remain with Aegon Ltd. Aegon will adjust its governance to reflect the change in legal domicile. It will preserve Aegon's current governance principles to the extent possible and practical in view of the redomiciliation  and where appropriate in the context of Aegon's international footprint. This includes Aegon's commitment to take into account the long-term interests of the company and all its stakeholders. It will apply well-recognized international governance standards to reflect the international footprint of Aegon following closing of the transaction with a.s.r. The new governance includes the implementation of a one-tier board structure  comprised of both executive and non-executive directors. The governance position of  and arrangements with  Vereniging Aegon will remain materially unchanged. The proposed Aegon Ltd. governance is explained in a draft Shareholder Circular that can be found on Aegon's website. Next steps Following the closing of the transaction with a.s.r.  the change in legal domicile is subject to shareholder approval at an Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders (EGM). The Board of Vereniging Aegon has been informed of the intended change in legal domicile. The Board of Vereniging Aegon is supportive and will seek the approval from its members for their support. Aegon today has also published a draft Shareholder Circular and a conversion proposal. In addition  Aegon will today publicly file with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) a draft registration statement on Form F-4  that is substantially similar to the draft Shareholder Circular  save for certain additions required pursuant to US law  and which is to be declared effective by the SEC prior to the shareholder vote. The BMA will assume the role of group supervisor following the transfer of Aegon's legal domicile. In the envisaged interim period between the closing of the transaction with a.s.r. and the completion of the transfer of Aegon's legal domicile  the role of group supervisor is expected to be allocated to the Direcci√≥n General de Seguros y Fondos de Pensiones (DGSFP)  in accordance with Solvency II regulations. The DGSFP  in cooperation with the DNB  and after informing the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA)  is expected to delegate its tasks and responsibilities related to its role as group supervisor to the DNB for a period which is expected to cover the duration of this interim period.June 30  2023 Press release Contacts Media relations Investor relations Carolien van der Giessen Jan Willem Weidema +31(0) 6 11953367 +31(0) 70 344 8028 carolien.vandergiessen@aegon.com janwillem.weidema@aegon.com Digital media call Today at 08:00 hrs.

Consequently  group supervision to move from the Dutch Central Bank to the Bermuda Monetary Authority Aegon will maintain its headquarters in the Netherlands and will remain a Dutch tax‚Ä¶,Aegon‚Äôs legal domicile to be transferred to Bermuda. Consequently  group supervision to move from the Dutch Central Bank (DNB) to the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA)Aegon will maintain its headquarters in the Netherlands and will remain a Dutch tax residentThe change in group supervision will have no material impact on Aegon‚Äôs capital management approachAegon to propose changes to its governance including the implementation of a one-tier boardThe Hague  June 30  2023 - Aegon today announces that it intends to move its legal seat to Bermuda. Subsequently  Aegon‚Äôs group supervision will transfer from the DNB to the BMA. Aegon will maintain its headquarters in the Netherlands  will remain a Dutch tax resident and will continue to be listed on Euronext Amsterdam and on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).Change in group supervisionFollowing the closing of the transaction with a.s.r.  Aegon will no longer have a regulated insurance business in the Netherlands. Under Solvency II rules  Aegon‚Äôs current supervisor  the DNB  can therefore no longer remain Aegon‚Äôs group supervisor. After consulting the members of the college of supervisors  the BMA has informed Aegon that the BMA would become its group supervisor if Aegon were to transfer its legal seat to Bermuda.Bermuda hosts many respected international insurance companies  including four of Aegon's subsidiaries. Bermuda‚Äôs regulatory regime is well recognized  having been granted equivalent status by the EU under the Solvency II regime  and by the UK under its own Solvency UK regime. It has also been designated as a qualified jurisdiction and reciprocal jurisdiction by the US National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). This enables insurance companies that are regulated by the BMA to easily conduct cross-border business.‚ÄúI welcome the transfer of group supervision from the DNB to the BMA ‚Äù said Lard Friese  Aegon‚Äôs CEO. ‚ÄúBermuda has an established  well-regarded regulatory regime that will facilitate the implementation of our strategy to build leaders in investment  protection and retirement solutions  as outlined at our recent Capital Markets Day.‚ÄùThe change of Aegon‚Äôs legal domicile to Bermuda will allow Aegon to maintain its headquarters in the Netherlands  remain a Dutch tax resident  and maintain its listings on Euronext Amsterdam and the NYSE.Continuity in supervision of local entities and accountingAegon‚Äôs regulated insurance entities in the US  UK  Spain  Portugal and in other jurisdictions will continue to be supervised by their current local regulators. In addition  Aegon‚Äôs asset management activities in the Netherlands will continue to be supervised by the Authority Financial Markets and the DNB.Aegon will continue to report under IFRS accounting standards. Aegon is exploring the implementation of US GAAP in the medium term  in addition to IFRS  so as to allow for better comparison against US peers  and provide long-term strategic flexibility for the Group.No material impact on Aegon‚Äôs capital management frameworkThe change in group supervision will not have a material impact on Aegon‚Äôs capital management approach  which will continue to focus on the capitalization of its operating units  Cash Capital at the Holding and gross financial leverage. Consequently  the financial targets for 2025 that Aegon provided at its recent Capital Markets Day are unchanged. Furthermore  Aegon also reconfirms its intention to initiate a EUR 1.5 billion share buyback program shortly after the closing of the transaction with a.s.r.Aegon expects its group solvency ratio and surplus under the Bermuda solvency framework to be broadly in line with that under the Solvency II framework during a transition period until the end of 2027. The method to translate Transamerica‚Äôs capital position into the group solvency position will also be similar to the current methodology. After the transition period  Aegon will fully adopt the Bermudian solvency framework.Aegon anticipates that its debt instruments that are currently grandfathered under the Solvency II regime will remain so until the end of 2025. In addition  Aegon‚Äôs debt instruments will continue to be subject to existing triggers for mandatory deferral or cancellation of interest payments or conversion into equity  based on the group solvency ratio.Aegon‚Äôs future debt structure and refinancing decisions will remain primarily driven by economic considerations  taking into account investor expectations  market circumstances  regulatory requirements  and rating agency considerations. As previously announced  Aegon intends to reduce its gross financial leverage by up to EUR 700 million following the closing of the transaction with a.s.r.Change in governanceUpon the change of the legal domicile becoming effective  Aegon N.V. will be converted into Aegon Ltd.  a Bermuda entity  and all existing assets and liabilities  rights  obligations and other legal relationships of Aegon N.V. will remain with Aegon Ltd. Aegon will adjust its governance to reflect the change in legal domicile. It will preserve Aegon‚Äôs current governance principles to the extent possible and practical in view of the redomiciliation  and where appropriate in the context of Aegon's international footprint. This includes Aegon‚Äôs commitment to take into account the long-term interests of the company and all its stakeholders. It will apply well-recognized international governance standards to reflect the international footprint of Aegon following closing of the transaction with a.s.r. The new governance includes the implementation of a one-tier board structure  comprised of both executive and non-executive directors. The governance position of  and arrangements with  Vereniging Aegon will remain materially unchanged. The proposed Aegon Ltd. governance is explained in a draft Shareholder Circular that can be found on Aegon‚Äôs website.Next stepsFollowing the closing of the transaction with a.s.r.  the change in legal domicile is subject to shareholder approval at an Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders (EGM). The Board of Vereniging Aegon has been informed of the intended change in legal domicile. The Board of Vereniging Aegon is supportive and will seek the approval from its members for their support.Aegon today has also published a draft Shareholder Circular and a conversion proposal. In addition  Aegon will today publicly file with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) a draft registration statement on Form F-4  that is substantially similar to the draft Shareholder Circular  save for certain additions required pursuant to US law  and which is to be declared effective by the SEC prior to the shareholder vote.The BMA will assume the role of group supervisor following the transfer of Aegon‚Äôs legal domicile. In the envisaged interim period between the closing of the transaction with a.s.r. and the completion of the transfer of Aegon‚Äôs legal domicile  the role of group supervisor is expected to be allocated to the Direcci√≥n General de Seguros y Fondos de Pensiones (DGSFP)  in accordance with Solvency II regulations. The DGSFP  in cooperation with the DNB  and after informing the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA)  is expected to delegate its tasks and responsibilities related to its role as group supervisor to the DNB for a period which is expected to cover the duration of this interim period.Contacts Media relations Investor relations Carolien van der Giessen Jan Willem Weidema +31(0) 6 11953367 +31(0) 70 344 8028 carolien.vandergiessen@aegon.com janwillem.weidema@aegon.comDigital media callToday at 08:00 hrs.

Aegon's Extraordinary Meeting of Shareholders (EGM) approved the ASR transaction on January 17  2023.

June 30  2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Zai Lab Limited (NASDAQ: ZLAB; HKEX: 9688) and argenx (Euronext & Nasdaq: ARGX) today announced that China‚Äôs National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) has approved the Biologics License Application (BLA) for VYVGART¬Æ (efgartigimod alfa injection)  a first-in-class neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) antagonist  as an add on to standard therapy for the treatment of adult patients with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive. Zai Lab will now work with the National Healthcare Security Administration (NHSA) for NRDL inclusion to enable broad access for patients.‚ÄúWe are pleased to have the NMPA‚Äôs approval for VYVGART for intravenous use. This important milestone brings forward a novel treatment for gMG patients who face many challenges living with this complex and difficult-to-control autoimmune disease ‚Äù said Dr. Samantha Du  Founder  Chairperson  and Chief Executive Officer of Zai Lab. ‚ÄúWe appreciate the NMPA for their thorough assessment of VYVGART  recognizing its differentiated profile and the large unmet medical need in China. In addition to gMG  we are working with argenx on three registrational programs exploring other immunoglobulin G (IgG)-related autoimmune indications and are looking forward to exploring even more indications over time.‚Äù‚ÄúThis approval by the NMPA for VYVGART  our sixth approval globally  is the first-and-only FcRn blocker available for people living with gMG in China. This is another milestone on our path to redefine what well-controlled means for gMG patients and underscores our longstanding commitment to the global gMG community ‚Äù said Tim Van Hauwermeiren  Chief Executive Officer of argenx. ‚ÄúWe celebrate this achievement with our partner  Zai Lab  who shares our mutual passion to bring needed innovation to people with gMG in China. We look forward to continuing our partnership as we further explore efgartigimod in other indications  expanding our global footprint in one of the world‚Äôs fastest growing markets to reach more people living with severe autoimmune diseases.‚Äù‚ÄúThere are over 200 000 people living with myasthenia gravis (MG) in China1. Despite the availability of current treatment options  there remains a significant unmet medical need. The approval of VYVGART in China marks an important milestone for patients and provides physicians with a novel  safe and effective therapy to help improve the quality of life for those in their care ‚Äù said Dr. Chongbo Zhao  M.D.  Ph.D.  Deputy Director of Department of Neurology  Huashan Hospital Affiliated to Fudan University  Director of Working Group of Huashan Rare Disease Center. ‚ÄúIn clinical studies  efgartigimod demonstrated outstanding characteristics in terms of onset of action  efficacy  and safety  helping to improve patients' muscle strength and quality of life. VYVGART  the first-and-only approved FcRn antagonist for gMG patients in China  has the potential to revolutionize the treatment landscape for gMG patients in China and we are grateful to Zai Lab for providing the support for these patients who have been devastated by this disease for so long.‚ÄùThe global Phase 3 ADAPT trial met its primary endpoint  demonstrating that significantly more anti-AChR antibody positive gMG patients were responders on the Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) scale following treatment with efgartigimod compared with placebo (68% vs. 30%; p<0.0001). Responders were defined as having at least a two-point reduction on the MG-ADL scale sustained for four or more consecutive weeks during the first treatment cycle2.There were also significantly more responders on the Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) scale following treatment with efgartigimod compared with placebo (63% vs. 14%; p<0.0001). Responders were defined as having at least a three-point reduction on the QMG scale sustained for four or more consecutive weeks during the first treatment cycle.VYVGART demonstrated a well-tolerated safety profile in the ADAPT clinical trial. The most commonly reported adverse reactions that occurred more frequently with VYVGART than placebo were upper respiratory tract infections (10.7% following treatment with efgartigimod vs. 4.8% of placebo) and urinary tract infections (9.5% vs. 4.8%).About VYVGARTVYVGART is a human IgG1 antibody fragment that binds to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)  resulting in the reduction of circulating IgG autoantibodies. It is the first approved FcRn blocker in the United States  EU and China for the treatment of adults with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive  and in Japan for the treatment of adults with gMG who do not have sufficient response to steroids or non-steroidal immunosuppressive therapies (ISTs).Zai Lab has an exclusive license agreement with argenx to develop and commercialize efgartigimod in mainland China  Hong Kong  Macau  and Taiwan (Greater China).About Myasthenia Gravis in ChinaMyasthenia gravis (MG) is a chronic autoimmune disease  characterized by debilitating and potentially life-threatening muscle weakness. There are approximately 200 000 people in China living with the disease1. More than 85% of people with MG progress to gMG within 18 months; in this generalized form of the disease  skeletal muscles throughout the body may be affected  resulting in weakness and early fatigue. Difficulties with double vision  facial expression  speech  swallowing  and ambulation are frequent and difficult to manage for patients and treating physicians. In more life-threatening cases  gMG can affect the muscles responsible for breathing  which can be fatal. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors  steroids  immunosuppressants  and IVIg are the mainstay of treatment in China. However  there is a lack of high-level evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of MG  representing significant unmet needs.1 Nationwide population-based epidemiological study of myasthenia gravis in Taiwan  2010.2 Howard JF et al.

Zai Lab will now work with the National Healthcare Security Administration (NHSA) for NRDL inclusion to enable broad access for patients.‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúThis approval by the NMPA for VYVGART  our sixth approval globally  is the first-and-only FcRn blocker available for people living with gMG in China. This is another milestone on our path to redefine what well-controlled means for gMG patients and underscores our longstanding commitment to the global gMG community ‚Äù said Tim Van Hauwermeiren  Chief Executive Officer of argenx. ‚ÄúWe celebrate this achievement with our partner  Zai Lab  who shares our mutual passion to bring needed innovation to people with gMG in China. We look forward to continuing our partnership as we further explore efgartigimod in other indications  expanding our global footprint in one of the world‚Äôs fastest growing markets to reach more people living with severe autoimmune diseases.‚Äù‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄúWe are pleased to have the NMPA‚Äôs approval for VYVGART for intravenous use. This important milestone brings forward a novel treatment for gMG patients who face many challenges living with this complex and difficult-to-control autoimmune disease ‚Äù said Dr. Samantha Du  Founder  Chairperson  and Chief Executive Officer of Zai Lab. ‚ÄúWe appreciate the NMPA for their thorough assessment of VYVGART  recognizing its differentiated profile and the large unmet medical need in China. In addition to gMG  we are working with argenx on three registrational programs exploring other immunoglobulin G (IgG)-related autoimmune indications and are looking forward to exploring even more indications over time.‚Äù‚ÄúThere are over 200 000 people living with myasthenia gravis (MG) in China1. Despite the availability of current treatment options  there remains a significant unmet medical need. The approval of VYVGART in China marks an important milestone for patients and provides physicians with a novel  safe and effective therapy to help improve the quality of life for those in their care ‚Äù said Dr. Chongbo Zhao  M.D.  Ph.D.  Deputy Director of Department of Neurology  Huashan Hospital Affiliated to Fudan University  Director of Working Group of Huashan Rare Disease Center. ‚ÄúIn clinical studies  efgartigimod demonstrated outstanding characteristics in terms of onset of action  efficacy  and safety  helping to improve patients' muscle strength and quality of life. VYVGART  the first-and-only approved FcRn antagonist for gMG patients in China  has the potential to revolutionize the treatment landscape for gMG patients in China and we are grateful to Zai Lab for providing the support for these patients who have been devastated by this disease for so long.‚ÄùThe global Phase 3 ADAPT trial met its primary endpoint  demonstrating that significantly more anti-AChR antibody positive gMG patients were responders on the Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) scale following treatment with efgartigimod compared with placebo (68% vs. 30%; p<0.0001). Responders were defined as having at least a two-point reduction on the MG-ADL scale sustained for four or more consecutive weeks during the first treatment cycle2.There were also significantly more responders on the Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) scale following treatment with efgartigimod compared with placebo (63% vs. 14%; p<0.0001). Responders were defined as having at least a three-point reduction on the QMG scale sustained for four or more consecutive weeks during the first treatment cycle.VYVGART demonstrated a well-tolerated safety profile in the ADAPT clinical trial. The most commonly reported adverse reactions that occurred more frequently with VYVGART than placebo were upper respiratory tract infections (10.7% following treatment with efgartigimod vs. 4.8% of placebo) and urinary tract infections (9.5% vs. 4.8%).About VYVGARTVYVGART is a human IgG1 antibody fragment that binds to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)  resulting in the reduction of circulating IgG autoantibodies. It is the first approved FcRn blocker in the United States  EU and China for the treatment of adults with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive  and in Japan for the treatment of adults with gMG who do not have sufficient response to steroids or non-steroidal immunosuppressive therapies (ISTs).Zai Lab has an exclusive license agreement with argenx to develop and commercialize efgartigimod in mainland China  Hong Kong  Macau  and Taiwan (Greater China).About Myasthenia Gravis in ChinaMyasthenia gravis (MG) is a chronic autoimmune disease  characterized by debilitating and potentially life-threatening muscle weakness. There are approximately 200 000 people in China living with the disease1. More than 85% of people with MG progress to gMG within 18 months; in this generalized form of the disease  skeletal muscles throughout the body may be affected  resulting in weakness and early fatigue. Difficulties with double vision  facial expression  speech  swallowing  and ambulation are frequent and difficult to manage for patients and treating physicians. In more life-threatening cases  gMG can affect the muscles responsible for breathing  which can be fatal. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors  steroids  immunosuppressants  and IVIg are the mainstay of treatment in China. However  there is a lack of high-level evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of MG  representing significant unmet needs.1 Nationwide population-based epidemiological study of myasthenia gravis in Taiwan  2010.2 Howard JF et al.

Subject to the terms and conditions of the agreement  BioSenic shall be entitled to draw down three tranches of each EUR 0.3 million in June  July and August under the existing convertible bond program  for an aggregate principal amount of EUR 0.9 million. The parties will discuss how to draw down the remaining EUR 600 000 of the existing program and have initiated discussions with a view to a possible renewal of the program. BioSenic is currently preparing a fundraising to be organized in Q3/Q4 2023 to initiate the Phase III clinical trial in chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD) in Q1 2024.With the short-term financing agreement and the current renegotiation of potential terms with main creditors  BioSenic anticipates having sufficient cash to carry out its business objectives during such process.‚ÄúI would like to thank ABO for the support it has provided and the institutional creditors for their support during this strategic period ‚Äù said Prof. Fran√ßois Rieger  PhD  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of BioSenic. ‚ÄúThe reorganization of BioSenic and the revaluation of its core assets has now been carefully implemented  eight months after the successful reverse merger of Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics to form BioSenic. The financial restructuring of the main debt is underway. This will put the company on a firmer financial footing and increase its attractiveness to investors. BioSenic‚Äôs primary current goal is to devote full financial resources to the development of our lead treatment program targeting cGVHD. The initial task will be to confirm previous results on the therapeutic value of an arsenic salt in its oral formulation. Using the 505(b)(2) FDA pathway  these results will lead to other indications  either in autoimmunity or later in cancer.‚ÄùAbout BioSenicBioSenic is a leading biotech company specializing in the development of clinical assets issued from: (i)  the allogeneic cell therapy platform ALLOB and (ii) the Arsenic TriOxide (ATO) platform. Key target indications for the platforms include Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD)  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) and high-risk tibial fractures.Following the merger in October 2022  BioSenic combines the strategic positionings and strengths of Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics. The merger also enables Biosenic to add to its innovative cell therapy platform and strong IP for tissue repair protection with an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/OATO.BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com .About BioSenic technology platformsBioSenic‚Äôs technology is based on two main platforms:The allogeneic cell and gene therapy platform  developed by BioSenic with differentiated bone marrow sourced Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) that can be stored at the point of use in hospitals. Its current investigational medicinal product  ALLOB  represents a unique  proprietary approach to organ repair and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells on the site of injury after a single local injection. These cells are produced via a BioSenic's scalable manufacturing process. Following the CTA approval by regulatory authorities in Europe  BioSenic had initiated patient recruitment for the Phase IIb clinical trial with ALLOB in patients with difficult tibial fractures  using its optimized production process. ALLOB was evaluated in a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase IIb study in patients with high-risk tibial fractures  using its optimized production process  after a successful first safety and efficacy study (Phase 1/2a) on fractured long bones  with late delayed union. The patient recruitment has been halted late February 2023 with 57 patients and the new rules permitted for statistical analysis allowed BioSenic to get the main results of this trial much earlier than anticipated in the original protocol  by this mid-June 2023. In June 2023  BioSenic decided to suspend its interventional trial on fracture healing using ALLOB  following negative results obtained for the primary endpoint in the exploratory Phase IIb clinical trial with ALLOB IIb  which focused on safety and treatment timing efficacy. The Arsenic TriOxide (ATO) platform developed by Medsenic. The immunomodulatory properties of ATO have demonstrated a double basic effect on cells of the immune system. The first effect is the increase of the cell oxidative stress in activated B  T or other cells of the innate/adaptative immune system to the point they will enter a cell death program (apoptosis) and be eliminated. The second effect is potent immunomodulatory properties on several pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in inflammatory or autoimmune cell pathways. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. GvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). GvHD is primarily mediated by the transplanted immune system that can lead to severe multiorgan damage. Medsenic had been successful in a Phase II trial with its intravenous formulation  allowing arsenic trioxide to be granted an orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA and is heading towards an international Phase III confirmatory study  with a new  IP protected  oral (OATO) formulation. Moderate to Severe forms of Systemic Lupus erythematosus (SLE) is another selected target  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastro-intestinal tract) in a Phase IIa study.Systemic Sclerosis is also  part of the clinical pipeline of BioSenic. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive. This gives good grounds to launch a Phase II clinical protocol for this serious disease that badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and with no actual current effective treatment.In addition  BioSenic is developing a next-generation  off-the-shelf  enhanced viscosupplement  JTA  consisting of a unique combination of plasma proteins  hyaluronic acid (a natural component of synovial fluid in the knee) and a third active component. JTA or some derivatives intend to provide added lubrication and protection to the cartilage of the arthritic joint and to alleviate osteoarthritic pain (OA) and inflammation. In March 2023  after the identification of new OA subtypes  BioSenic delivered a new post-hoc analysis of its Phase III JTA-004 trial on knee OA with positive action on the most severely affected patient population. This new post-hoc analysis drastically changes the therapeutic profile of the combined components and allows for better patient targeting in new clinical developments. The company  which does not intend to allocate R&D resources to support the clinical development of JTA-004 itself will focus its R&D activities on the development of its autoimmune (ATO) platform.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAFran√ßois Rieger  PhD  Chief Executive OfficerTel: +33 (0)671 73 31 59investorrelations@biosenic.comInternational Media Enquiries:IB CommunicationsNeil Hunter / Michelle BoxallTel: +44 (0)20 8943 4685neil.hunter@ibcomms.agency / michelle@ibcomms.agencyFor French Investor Enquiries:Seitosei ActifinGhislaine GasparettoTel: +33 (0)1 56 88 11 22ggasparetto@actifin.frCertain statements  beliefs and opinions in this press release are forward-looking  which reflect the Company or  as appropriate  the Company directors‚Äô current expectations and projections about future events.

The LTIR includes safety incidents (injuries) and work-related health issues (illnesses) that lead to an employee being unable to work.Organic growthOrganic growth corresponds to the increase in revenue for a given period (the ‚Äúcurrent period‚Äù) compared to the revenue reported for the same period of the prior fiscal year  calculated using the exchange rate for the prior fiscal year; and excluding the impact of business acquisitions (or gain of control) and divestments  as follows:for businesses acquired (or gain of control) during the current period  revenue generated since the acquisition date is excluded from the organic growth calculation;for businesses acquired (or gain of control) during the prior fiscal year  revenue generated during the current period up until the first anniversary date of the acquisition is excluded;for businesses divested (or loss of control) during the prior fiscal year  revenue generated in the comparative period of the prior fiscal year until the divestment date is excluded;for businesses divested (or loss of control) during the current fiscal year  revenue generated in the period commencing 12 months before the divestment date up to the end of the comparative period of the prior fiscal year is excluded.Underlying operating profit marginThe Underlying operating profit margin corresponds to Underlying operating profit divided by revenues.Underlying operating profit margin at constant ratesThe Underlying operating profit margin at constant rates corresponds to Underlying operating profit divided by revenues  calculated by converting 2023 figures at Fiscal 2022 rates  except for countries with hyperinflationary economies.REVENUE FOR THE FIRST 9 MONTHS FISCAL 2023REVENUES(in million euros) 9M FY23 9M FY22 ORGANICGROWTH EXTERNALGROWTH CURRENCYEFFECT TOTALGROWTH North America 8 157 6 598 +14.9 % +0.8 % +7.9 % +23.6 % Europe 6 068 5 910 +7.0 % -2.6 % -1.7 % +2.7 % Rest of the World 3 110 2 659 +15.3 % -1.7 % +3.4 % +17.0 % ON-SITE SERVICES 17 335 15 167 +11.9 % -1.0 % +3.4 % +14.3 % BENEFITS & REWARDS SERVICES 781 620 +24.7 % -0.6 % +1.9 % +25.9 % Elimination (5) (2) TOTAL GROUP 18 111 15 784 +12.4 % -1.0 % +3.3 % +14.7 %REVENUES BY SEGMENT(in million euros) 9M FY23 9M FY22 ORGANIC GROWTH Business & Administrations 9 585 8 046 +17.6 % Healthcare & Seniors 4 367 4 088 +3.0 % Education 3 383 3 033 +8.7 % ON-SITE SERVICES TOTAL 17 335 15 167 +11.9 %REVENUES BY SEGMENT(in million euros) 9M FY23 9M FY22 ORGANIC GROWTH Business & Administrations 2 842 2 058 +27.1 % Healthcare & Seniors 2 578 2 207 +9.3 % Education 2 737 2 333 +9.5 % NORTH AMERICA TOTAL 8 157 6 598 +14.9 %REVENUES BY SEGMENT(in million euros) 9M FY23 9M FY22 ORGANIC GROWTH Business & Administrations 3 957 3 605 +13.5 % Healthcare & Seniors 1 539 1 660 -5.8 % Education 572 645 +3.4 % EUROPE TOTAL 6 068 5 910 +7.0 %REVENUES BY SEGMENT(in million euros) 9M FY23 9M FY22 ORGANIC GROWTH Business & Administrations 2 786 2 383 +15.6 % Healthcare & Seniors 250 221 +6.0 % Education 74 55 +35.7 % REST OF THE WORLD TOTAL 3 110 2 659 +15.3 %REVENUES BY NATURE(in million euros) 9M FY23 9M FY22 ORGANIC GROWTH Operating Revenues 683 580 +16.3 % Financial Revenues 98 40 +147.0 % BENEFITS & REWARDS SERVICES 781 620 +24.7 %REVENUES BY ACTIVITY(in million euros) 9M FY23 9M FY22 ORGANIC GROWTH Employee benefits 647 507 +25.7 % Services Diversification* 134 113 +19.9 % BENEFITS & REWARDS SERVICES 781 620 +24.7 %REVENUES BY REGION(in million euros) 9M FY23 9M FY22 ORGANIC GROWTH Europe  USA and Asia 484 406 +23.2 % Latin America 297 214 +27.4 % BENEFITS & REWARDS SERVICES 781 620 +24.7 %CURRENCY EFFECTSExchange rate fluctuations do not generate operational risks because each subsidiary bills its revenues and incurs its expenses in the same currency. However  given the weight of the Benefit & Rewards activity in Brazil  and the high level of its margins relative to the Group  when the Brazilian real declines against the euro  it has a negative effect on the underlying operating margin due to a change in the mix of margins. Conversely  when the Brazilian real strengthens Group margins increase.1‚Ç¨= AVERAGE RATE9M FY 2023 AVERAGE RATE 9M FY 2022 AVERAGE RATE9M FY 2023VS. 9M FY 2022 CLOSING RATEFY 2023AT 05/31/2023 CLOSING RATEFY 2022AT 08/31/2022 CLOSING RATE05/31/2023VS. 08/31/2022 U.S. dollar 1.049 1.124 +7.2 % 1.068 1.000 -6.4 % Pound sterling 0.875 0.845 -3.4 % 0.864 0.860 -0.4 % Brazilian real 5.443 5.939 +9.1 % 5.429 5.148 -5.2 %The +3.3% currency impact for the first 9 months of Fiscal 2023 is linked to the increase in the U.S. dollar of +7.2% year-on-year  and the Brazilian real of +9.1%.

Presentations will also focus on the importance of real-world data and its use in better understanding current patient experiences. In total  nine abstracts will be presented  including three oral presentations.In June  rozanolixizumab was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  for the treatment of generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) in adult patients who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AchR) or anti-muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) antibody positive 6 having been granted Priority Review for its Biologic License Application (BLA). In the U.S.  under the FDAs non-proprietary naming of biological products guidance  the nonproprietary name for this medicine is rozanolixizumab-noli. It is an FDA-approved treatment for both anti-AChR and anti-MuSK antibody-positive gMG  the two most common subtypes of gMG. Rozanolixizumab is currently only approved in the U.S.  and is under review by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) for the treatment of adults with gMG. Responses from regulatory agencies to these submissions are expected by H1 2024.Zilucoplan is currently under review by the U.S. FDA  EMA and the Japanese PMDA for the treatment of adult gMG patients who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive. Responses from these regulatory agencies are expected from H2 2023 onwards. The safety and efficacy of zilucoplan have not been established and it is not currently approved for use in any indication by any regulatory authority worldwide.These data further inform UCB's innovative approach to evolving science into meaningful solutions that help improve outcomes and address unmet needs of people living with gMG.Donatello Crocetta  Head of Global Rare Disease & Rare Medical  UCB  explained: ""The additional results from the Phase 3 MycarinG and RAISE studies demonstrate UCB's dedication to finding treatment options for patients with gMG and reinforce the depth and strength of our expanding rare disease pipeline and portfolio. Following on from our recent approval for rozanolixizumab in the U.S. for the treatment of adult patients who are anti-acetylcholine receptor or anti-muscle-specific tyrosine kinase antibody positive gMG  we're very excited to be collaborating with the gMG community to extend knowledge about new medicines which could  in the future  play an important role in the treatment of this rare neuromuscular disease.""Data from UCB's extensive work to better understand the burden of gMG in different European countries will also be presented in 4 posters. Additionally  through an immersive VR experience co-created with the members of the gMG community  UCB will enable HCPs to gain a deeper understanding of the daily challenges experienced by people living with gMG.""Because of the high disease and treatment burden that gMG elicits along with the impact on a person's daily life  it is important for us to contribute and improve our wealth of knowledge of this debilitating rare disease - especially relevant following Myasthenia Gravis Awareness Month by focusing - on patients and digital innovations  with the aim to address the needs of people living with gMG."" said Manuela Maronati  Head of Europe  Rare Disease  UCB. ""As well as increasing our understanding of gMG  we hope to continue to work towards bringing new treatment options to patients. We are looking forward to hearing from the European Medicines Agency on their review of the Marketing Authorization Application for both rozanolixizumab and zilucoplan.""UCB presentations during EAN 2023About Generalized Myasthenia Gravis (gMG)gMG is a rare disease with a global prevalence of 100-350 cases per every 1 million people.7 People living with gMG can experience a variety of symptoms  including severe muscular weakness that can result in life-threatening weakness of the muscles of respiration  double vision  drooping eyelids  and difficulty swallowing  chewing and talking.8 9In gMG  pathogenic autoantibodies can impair synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) by targeting specific proteins on the post-synaptic membrane.3 10 This disrupts the ability of the nerves to stimulate the muscle and results in a weaker contraction. gMG can occur in any race  gender or age.11About rozanolixizumabRozanolixizumab is a subcutaneous administered  humanized monoclonal antibody that specifically binds  with high affinity  to human neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). It has been designed to block the interaction of FcRn and Immunoglobulin G (IgG)  accelerating the catabolism of antibodies and reducing the concentration of pathogenic IgG autoantibodies.12Outside of the U.S. rozanolixizumab is not approved for use in any indication by any other regulatory authority worldwide.Important U.S. Safety Information for RYSTIGGO¬ÆWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSInfections: RYSTIGGO may increase the risk of infection. Delay RYSTIGGO administration in patients with an active infection until the infection is resolved. During treatment with RYSTIGGO  monitor for clinical signs and symptoms of infection. If serious infection occurs  administer appropriate treatment and consider withholding RYSTIGGO until the infection has resolved.ImmunizationImmunization with vaccines during RYSTIGGO treatment has not been studied. The safety of immunization with live or live-attenuated vaccines and the response to immunization with any vaccine are unknown. Because RYSTIGGO causes a reduction in IgG levels  vaccination with live-attenuated or live vaccines is not recommended during treatment with RYSTIGGO. Evaluate the need to administer age-appropriate vaccines according to immunization guidelines before initiation of a new treatment cycle with RYSTIGGO.Aseptic Meningitis: Serious adverse reactions of aseptic meningitis (also called drug-induced aseptic meningitis) have been reported in patients treated with RYSTIGGO. If symptoms consistent with aseptic meningitis develop  diagnostic workup and treatment should be initiated according to the standard of care.Hypersensitivity Reactions: Hypersensitivity reactions  including angioedema and rash  were observed in patients treated with RYSTIGGO. Management of hypersensitivity reactions depends on the type and severity of the reaction. Monitor patients during treatment with RYSTIGGO and for 15 minutes after for clinical signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions. If a reaction occurs  institute appropriate measures if needed.ADVERSE REACTIONSIn a placebo-controlled study  the most common adverse reactions (reported in at least 10% of RYSTIGGO-treated patients) were headache  infections  diarrhea  pyrexia  hypersensitivity reactions  and nausea. Serious infections were reported in 4% of patients treated with RYSTIGGO. Three fatal cases of pneumonia were identified  caused by COVID-19 infection in two patients and an unknown pathogen in one patient. Six cases of infections led to discontinuation of RYSTIGGO.Full U.S. Prescribing Information is available at https://www.ucb-usa.com/RYSTIGGO-prescribing-information.pdfAbout zilucoplanZilucoplan is a once-daily subcutaneous (SC)  self-administered peptide inhibitor of complement component 5 (C5 inhibitor) under clinical development by UCB in gMG. As a C5 inhibitor  zilucoplan inhibits complement-mediated damage to the neuromuscular junction through its targeted dual mechanism of action.13 In 2019  the U.S. FDA granted orphan drug designation to zilucoplan for the treatment of myasthenia gravis.14 Orphan designation was granted in July 2022 by the European Commission to zilucoplan for the treatment of myasthenia gravis.15 The safety and efficacy of zilucoplan have not been established and it is not currently approved for use in any indication by any regulatory authority worldwide.For further information  contact UCB:Global CommunicationsJim BaxterT +44 7900 605 652email jim.baxter@ucb.comCorporate CommunicationsLaurent SchotsT +32.2.559.92.64email laurent.schots@ucb.comInvestor RelationsAntje WitteT +32.2.559.94.14email antje.witte@ucb.comAbout UCBUCB  Brussels  Belgium (www.ucb.com) is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of innovative medicines and solutions to transform the lives of people living with severe diseases of the immune system or of the central nervous system.

These forward-looking statements are based on current plans  estimates and beliefs of management. All statements  other than statements of historical facts  are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements  including estimates of revenues  operating margins  capital expenditures  cash  other financial information  expected legal  arbitration  political  regulatory or clinical results or practices and other such estimates and results. By their nature  such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and assumptions which might cause the actual results  financial condition  performance or achievements of UCB  or industry results  to differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Important factors that could result in such differences include: the global spread and impact of COVID-19  changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  will progress to product approval or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products  which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB's efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover  sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment  including pricing pressure  political and public scrutiny  customer and prescriber patterns or practices  and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes. Finally  a breakdown  cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality  integrity and availability of UCB's data and systems. Given these uncertainties  you should not place undue reliance on any of such forward-looking statements. There can be no guarantee that the investigational or approved products described in this press release will be submitted or approved for sale or for any additional indications or labelling in any market  or at any particular time  nor can there be any guarantee that such products will be or will continue to be commercially successful in the future. UCB is providing this information  including forward-looking statements  only as of the date of this press release and it does not reflect any potential impact from the evolving COVID-19 pandemic  unless indicated otherwise. UCB is following the worldwide developments diligently to assess the financial significance of this pandemic to UCB.

Our strategic choices have paid off  enabling us to maintain a positive momentum of profitable growth. The Group has thus achieved 15 consecutive quarters of growth between 2020 and 2022. Sales remained buoyant  thanks to high-potential new products  flagship license portfolios and the explosion of digital sales in France and abroad. Overall for the year  sales closed at an all-time high for Lexibook  at ‚Ç¨51.2 million (+13.3%). FOB sales (sales invoiced directly from HK on FOB HK deliveries by full containers) and non-FOB sales grew in tandem  reflecting the enthusiasm for the Group's products among international retailers.Over the full fiscal year  France accounted for 38% of sales  up 17%. International sales are also driving growth  and offer considerable potential.In terms of products  sales growth was driven by toys  watches  musical instruments and walkie-talkies  thanks to new products for the Group's own brands and licensed products. Sales growth was spectacular in toys (+29%)  which now account for 44% of total sales  with the success of the Powerman¬Æ robot range  Crosslander¬Æ radio-controlled vehicles  educational products and electronic games. Alarm clocks  audio and music products are also particularly popular  with growth of +12%  +10% and +10% respectively.Licensed products also contributed to this growth  both on existing  highly dynamic licenses such as Snow Queen  Patrol and Spiderman  and on new licenses such as Super Mario  Miraculous and Harry Potter.Finally  the Group's digitalization is bearing fruit: digital sales are up sharply both in France and in the various European markets  thanks in particular to a massive  Europe-wide digital marketing campaign for the Group's new products. This campaign generated more than a billion digital impressions of the Group's products  mainly in Europe  helping to boost Lexibook brand awareness to an unprecedented level.The table below shows gross margin  gross margin adjusted for currency impacts included in financial income and exceptional items included in gross margin  and net margin 4 after advertising contributions and royalties:MARCH 31  2023 MARCH 31  2022 Net sales 51 236 987 45 248 664 Cost of goods sold -23 285 934 -21 636 701 Gross margin 27 951 053 23 611 963 Gross margin 54 6% 52 2% Net currency impact -401 341 13 985 Adjusted gross margin 27 549 712 23 625 948 Adjusted gross margin 53 8% 52 2% Advertising contributions 6 524 906 4 467 185 Royalties 3 619 083 3 035 116 Adjusted net margin 4 17 405 723 16 123 647 Adjusted net margin 4 34 0% 35 6%Thanks to targeted price increases in 2022 and the launch of new high-margin products  the gross margin adjusted for currency effects rose by 1.6 points to 53.8%. This ‚Ç¨3.9 million rise was made possible by price and volume increases  against a backdrop of rising raw material costs  enabling economies of scale and optimization of logistics costs  despite freight costs remaining very high compared with the ""pre-Covid"" period.This increase in gross margin is partly reflected in the restated net margin 4  which rose to ‚Ç¨17.4m from ‚Ç¨16.1m a year earlier  reflecting higher advertising expenditure and a slight increase in the share of licensed products in total sales.EBITDA :EBITDA (earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortization) fell slightly to ‚Ç¨4.7m from ‚Ç¨5.4m. This is mainly due to the impact of changes in depreciation  amortization and provisions amounting to 0.7 M‚Ç¨  while the change in operating income in value terms was very slight.Operating income :Taking advantage of the positive momentum  Lexibook launched a major international digital advertising campaign  generating over a billion digital impressions in 1 year for its products in the EMEA zone  coupled with a TV advertising campaign in France. External services rose by ‚Ç¨4.1 million  mainly as a result of increased advertising expenditure and logistics services linked to the growth in business volumes and inventories.Personnel costs rose by ‚Ç¨0.5m  mainly due to the provisioning of bonuses in view of the increase in business.Other operating expenses were down slightly (-0.2 M‚Ç¨) despite a 0.6 M‚Ç¨ increase in royalty expenses linked to the rise in business  due to the net improvement in customer/supplier provisions this year.Finally  despite the substantial advertising investment of over ‚Ç¨2 million in 2022 and the exceptional rise in logistics costs  the Group's operating income held steady at ‚Ç¨4.3 million vs. ‚Ç¨4.3 million in N-1  thanks to the increase in sales volume and the higher gross margin.Net financial expense :Net financial income was down by 0.6 M‚Ç¨  mainly due to the 0.4 M‚Ç¨ variation in net foreign exchange gains on the evolution of the USD/EUR exchange rate. The cost of debt rose by 0.1 M‚Ç¨ due to the increased use of short-term financing lines  mainly as a result of changes in working capital requirements and  in particular  higher inventory levels. Against a backdrop of uncertainty about the end of the pandemic  the Group has opted to secure its supplies  even if this means carrying higher-than-normal inventory levels for several months.Taxes for the period represented an expense of ‚Ç¨0.3m  due to changes in the value of deferred tax assets (‚Ç¨0.2m) and to provisions for corporation tax payable (‚Ç¨0.4m).Against this backdrop  consolidated net income at March 31  2023 was ‚Ç¨3.0 million  compared with ‚Ç¨3.7 million at March 31  2022.Inventory and debt levelsNet debt stood at ‚Ç¨6.4 million at March 31  2023  compared with ‚Ç¨6.04 million at March 31  2022. This change is mainly due to new borrowings (+3.5 M‚Ç¨)  the repayment of short-term debt (-1.1 M‚Ç¨)  the change in factoring (-0.9 M‚Ç¨) and the net change in cash and cash equivalents (+1.2 M‚Ç¨).After deduction of factoring guarantee funds amounting to ‚Ç¨576 000  the Group's net debt came to ‚Ç¨5.8 000  compared with ‚Ç¨5.5 000 at 31-03-22.Given the high level of orders for the first few months of 2023/2024 and the shortage of components  the Group has chosen to secure its supplies by bringing in goods as soon as possible. Inventory levels thus stood at ‚Ç¨15.5 million at March 31  2023  compared with ‚Ç¨12.1 million at March 31  2022. This inventory level is in line with the production forecasts needed to meet orders and secure margins for the year.The average inventory depreciation rate was 6.6% at March 31  2023  compared with 7.3% at March 31  2022. This average rate is down due to the presence of a large number of new products in stock  reflecting a very healthy inventory.Outlook 2023-2024The Group presented its 2023 collections to international retailers  and the response to the new products was very positive. Bookings for the 2023 Christmas campaign are excellent  pointing to further growth in fiscal 2023-24. Fiscal Q1 22-23 was up 36% on fiscal Q1 21-22  itself up 78% on the previous year. The benchmark is therefore high for fiscal Q1 2023-24. Nevertheless  the order book suggests a similar level of activity to last year in Q1 2023-24  and the Group intends to continue its momentum of profitable growth this year.Several license contract extensions are currently being finalized to extend existing contracts into new zones  which could have an accelerating effect on the Group over the next few years. Some have already been confirmed:Extension of the Paw Patrol contract to the USA and Canada in the main categories (film scheduled for July 2023)Extension of Warner contract in the USA for Harry Potter (Chess) and Batman (Pinball).Lexibook expects sales in the USA to start up in the next few months  and to take off in fiscal year 24-25.The Group could also benefit from the favorable trend in the ‚Ç¨/USD exchange rate  should it remain at this level for the rest of the year  and from the improvement in international freight conditions to improve margins.Financial calendar 2022/2023Availability of the Universal Registration Document on March 31  2023: June 30  2023Financial calendar 2023/20241st quarter 2023-2024 sales: July 28  20232nd quarter 2023-2024 sales: November 15  2023Half-year results to September 30  2023: November 30  2023Q3 2023-2024 sales: February 15  2024Q4 2023-2024 sales: May 15  2024Annual results to March 31  2024: June 28  2024Availability of the Universal Registration Document on March 31  2024: June 28  2024ABOUT LEXIBOOKLEXIBOOK¬Æ  owner of over 40 registered brands  is the leader in intelligent electronic leisure products for children.
