No one can be in favour of something very concrete at the moment ‚Äù pointing out that the legislative proposal has yet to be presented by the EU executive.Because there is no precedent to use the profits from another country‚Äôs foreign reserves  ‚Äúwe have to study and understand the many  many different legal and factual challenges in order to see what is possible  and we are not there yet ‚Äù he said.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all terribly complicated and nobody knows at the moment what  or if  and how ‚Äù Scholz told reporters after the summit.No hazardous assets managementThis preferred plan to use the windfall profit means the EU will leave the Central Bank‚Äôs assets untouched.The leaders did not support the other option the Commission put forward last year  according to which it would manage the immobilised assets to hopefully generate profits  which would then be used to finance Ukraine‚Äôs reconstruction.‚ÄúWe cannot touch the assets of the Central Bank  these are the assets of the Central Bank. It would destabilise the financial system ‚Äù De Croo explained.The second option was left aside after the European Central Bank called the idea too risky and spooked the member states.[Edited by Nathalie Weatherald]Read more with EURACTIV,neutral,0.02,0.96,0.03,mixed,0.11,0.09,0.79,True,English,"['Russian frozen assets', 'EU leaders', 'work', 'caution', 'Commission President Ursula von der Leyen', 'Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo', 'Belgium-based Euroclear clearing house', 'many, many different legal', 'German Chancellor Olaf Scholz', 'potential legal bases', 'Russian central bank', 'ECB) interest rate', 'European Central Bank', 'hazardous assets management', 'member state leaders', 'one EU diplomat', 'legal basis', 'European Commission', 'European Union', 'member states', 'Russian assets', 'legal ways', 'current estimation', '‚Ç¨3 billion figure', 'financial system', 'foreign reserves', 'factual challenges', 'windfall profit', 'other option', 'second option', 'Nathalie Weatherald', 'EU experts', 'EU executive', 'EU leaders', 'creative way', 'financial stability', 'legislative proposal', 'frozen assets', 'international balance', 'preferred plan', 'profits', 'Friday', 'June', 'bloc', 'Ukraine', 'reconstruction', 'push', 'lawyers', 'economists', 'options', 'damages', 'meeting', 'idea', 'money', 'diplomats', 'rebuilding', 'returns', 'year', 'reporters', 'EURACTIV', 'concerns', 'eurozone', 'discussion', 'favour', 'something', 'moment', 'precedent', 'country', 'order', 'summit']",2023-07-01,2023-07-02,euractiv.com
