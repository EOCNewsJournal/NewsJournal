DEMIRE Deutsche Mittelstand Real Estate AG (ISIN: DE000A0XFSF0) (""DEMIRE"" or the ""Company"") has been informed by the purchaser of the LogPark logistics property in Leipzig for approximately EUR 121 million (""Property"") that the purchaser withdraws from the purchase agreement and intends not to complete the transaction.DEMIRE considers the withdrawal from the purchase agreement to be unfounded and will therefore consider legal action against it. However  the Company does not currently expect the transaction to be completed in 2023. As a result  the company will probably still generate rental income from the property in the entire 2023 financial year.Against this background  the Management Board of the Company has decided today to adjust the guidance for the 2023 financial year. Taking into account the additional rental income from the property for the second half of 2023  the Management Board now expects rental income of EUR 74.5 million to EUR 76.5 million (previously EUR 71 million to EUR 73 million) and Funds from Operations I (FFO I after tax  before minorities) of EUR 33 million to EUR 35 million (previously EUR 30 million to EUR 32 million) for 2023.Julius StinauerHead of Investor Relations & Corporate FinanceDEMIRE Deutsche Mittelstand Real Estate AGTelefon: +49 6103 372 4944Email: stinauer@demire.ag",neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,negative,0.0,0.02,0.98,True,English,"['EQS-Adhoc', 'DEMIRE', 'guidance', 'investor', 'purchase', 'LogPark', 'Leipzig', 'Corporate FinanceDEMIRE Deutsche Mittelstand Real Estate AGTelefon', 'EQS Group AG', 'entire 2023 financial year', 'additional rental income', 'LogPark logistics property', 'EQS News', 'Key word', 'inside information', 'Ad-hoc notification', 'Keyword(s', 'legal action', 'Management Board', 'second half', 'Julius StinauerHead', 'purchase agreement', 'Leipzig Langen', 'Investor Relations', 'Guidance change', 'Disposal', 'CEST', 'Disclosure', 'Article', 'MAR', 'Regulation', 'service', 'issuer', 'content', 'announcement', 'MMVO', '3 July', 'Company', 'purchaser', 'EUR', 'transaction', 'withdrawal', 'result', 'background', 'account', 'Funds', 'Operations', 'tax', 'minorities']",2023-07-03,2023-07-03,stock-world.de

Out of a total capacity of 260 megawatts  17 megawatts have started producing last Friday  while the remaining capacity will be gradually commissioned in the coming months.This power plant is backed by a 14-year power purchase agreement with Copel  a Brazilian utility and longstanding partner of Voltalia.SSM3-6 is part of the Serra Branca complex  the largest wind and solar complex in the world  fully developed by Voltalia and located in the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Norte.
