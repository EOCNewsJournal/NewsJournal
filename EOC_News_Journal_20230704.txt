Limited Liability The liability of the company's members is limited to any unpaid amount on the shares in the company held by them. 3A. Rights Attached to B Shares and Deferred Shares Notwithstanding article 4 the B Shares (as defined below) and the Deferred Shares (as defined below) shall have the rights attaching to shares set out in these articles save that in the event of a conflict between any provision in this article 3A and any other provision in these articles  the provisions in this article 3A shall prevail. (A) Election Form (i) Together with a circular to shareholders dated 26 May 2006 (the ""Circular"") ordinary shareholders were sent a form of election relating to non-cumulative preference shares of 1 pence each (the ""B Shares"") (the ""Election Form"") under which they could elect in relation to any B Shares to be issued to them to: (a) accept an offer by Deutsche Bank AG  London Branch to purchase the B Shares (the ""Initial Purchase Offer""); or (b) retain B Shares and receive the B Share Continuing Dividend (as defined below). (ii) Holders of B Shares who either wish to receive the Single B Share Dividend (as defined below) in respect of all of their B Shares or have not returned a duly completed Election Form by 3.00pm on 29 June 2006 (or such later time and/or date as the directors may determine) electing (revocably until that time) to accept the Initial Purchase Offer or to retain their B Shares and receive the B Share Continuing Dividend will be deemed instead to have elected to receive the Single B Share Dividend in relation to each B Share held by them. (iii) The directors may  if they so determine in their absolute discretion  accept an Election Form which is received after the relevant time or which is not correctly completed. The directors may  in addition  if they so determine in their absolute discretion  treat any other document or action as a valid Election Form or as the completion or delivery of a valid Election Form  as the case may be. (B) Income (i) Out of the profits available for distribution  a single dividend of 155 pence per B Share (the ""Single B Share Dividend"") shall be payable to those holders of B Shares in respect of which the Single B Share Dividend has deemed to have been made. (ii) Such dividend shall  if declared  become payable on 3 July 2006 or such later date as the directors may determine (the ""Single Dividend Date""). Each B Share in respect of which such dividend becomes payable shall  on such date (or such other date as the directors may determine)  be automatically converted into a deferred share of 1 pence nominal value with the rights and restrictions described in article 3A(I) (a ""Deferred Share""). (iii) Out of the profits available for distribution in respect of each financial year or other accounting period of the company  the holders of the B Shares who have elected to retain their B Shares shall be entitled  in priority to any payment of dividend or other distribution to the ordinary shareholders and before profits are carried to reserves  to be paid a non-cumulative preferential dividend (the ""B Share Continuing Dividend"") at such annual rate on a value of 155 pence per B Share as is calculated in accordance with article 3A(B)(v) below rounded down to the nearest 1/10 penny (exclusive of any associated tax credit relating thereto). (iv) The first B Share Continuing Dividend will be in respect of the period commencing on the Single Dividend Date and is to be paid in arrear on 2 July 2007 (or such later date as the directors may determine) and thereafter  such dividend will be paid (without having to be declared) annually in arrear on 2 July (or such later date as the directors may determine) in each year or  if any such date would otherwise fall on a date which is not a Business Day (as defined below) it shall be postponed to the next day which is a Business Day (without any interest or payment in respect of such delay) (each  a ""Payment Date""). (v) Each twelve month period ending on 2 July is called a ""Calculation Period"". The annual rate applicable to each Calculation Period shall be the Bank of England's Bank Rate (or  if such rate is for any reason unavailable  such other rate as the directors determine to be  in their absolute discretion  an appropriate alternative or replacement therefor) prevailing on the first Business Day of such Calculation Period. (vi) In this article  the expression ""Business Day"" means a day upon which commercial banks are generally open in London; and ""non-cumulative"" in relation to the B Share Continuing Dividend means that the dividend payable on each Payment Date is payable out of the profits of the company available for distribution in respect of the accounting reference period in which the Payment Date falls (including any reserves representing profits made in previous accounting reference periods) without any right in the case of a deficiency to resort to profits made in subsequent accounting reference periods. (vii) Payments of the B Share Continuing Dividend under article 3A(B)(iv) shall be made to holders on the company's relevant register on a date selected by the directors  being not less than 15 days nor more than 42 days (or  in default of selection by the directors  on the date falling 15 days) prior to the relevant Payment Date. (viii) The holders of the B Shares shall not be entitled to any further right of participation in the profits of the company. (ix) All B Share Continuing Dividends payable on the B Shares which are unclaimed for a period of six years from the date of due payment shall be forfeited and shall revert to the company. (C) Capital (i) Except as provided in article 3A(F) below  on a return of capital on winding-up (excluding any intra-group reorganisation on a solvent basis)  the holders of the B Shares shall be entitled  in priority to any payment to the ordinary shareholders to 155 pence per B Share held by them  together with a sum equal to the relevant proportion of the B Share Continuing Dividend (if any) under article 3A(B)(iii) which would have been payable  if the winding-up had taken effect on the last day of the then current Calculation Period  the relevant proportion being the number of days from and including the preceding Payment Date (or  if the date of such winding-up is prior to 3 July 2006  the Single Dividend Date) to  but excluding  the date of such winding-up  divided by 365. (ii) The aggregate entitlement of each holder of B Shares on a winding-up in respect of all of the B Shares held by him shall be rounded up to the nearest whole penny. (iii) The holders of the B Shares shall not be entitled to any further right of participation in the profits or assets of the company in excess of that specified in article 3A(C)(i) above. If on such a winding-up the amounts available for payment are insufficient to cover in full the amounts payable on the B Shares  the holders of such shares will share rateably in the distribution of assets (if any) in proportion to the full preferential amounts to which they are entitled. (D) Attendance and Voting at General Meetings (i) The holders of the B Shares shall not be entitled  in their capacity as holders of such shares  to receive notice of any general meeting of the company nor to attend  speak or vote at any such general meeting unless: (a) the business of the meeting includes the consideration of a resolution for the winding-up (excluding any intra-group reorganisation on a solvent basis) of the company  in which case the holders of the B Shares shall have the right to attend the general meeting and shall be entitled to speak and vote only on any such resolution; or (b) at the date of the notice convening the meeting  the B Share Continuing Dividend has remained unpaid for six months or more from any Payment Date  in which case the holders of the B Shares shall have the right to attend the general meeting and shall be entitled to speak and vote on all resolutions. (ii) Whenever the holders of the B Shares are entitled to vote at a general meeting of the company  on a show of hands every holder thereof who (being an individual) is present in person or (being a corporation) by a representative shall have one vote  and on a poll every such holder shall have such number of votes as he would be entitled to exercise had he been an ordinary shareholder arising if the B Shares registered in the name of such holder had been converted into such ordinary shares immediately prior to such meeting in accordance with the rights of the B Shares. (E) Company's Right to Purchase Subject to the provisions of the legislation and to compliance with applicable securities law and regulations but without the need to obtain the sanction of a special resolution of the holders of the B Shares  the company may at any time and at its sole discretion purchase B Shares (a) in the market or (b) by tender available alike to all holders of B Shares or (c) by private treaty  in each case at a price and upon such other terms and conditions as the directors may think fit. (F) Class Rights (i) The company may from time to time create  allot and issue further shares  whether ranking pari passu with or in priority to the B Shares. The creation  allotment or issue of any such further shares (whether or not ranking in any respect in priority to the B Shares) shall be treated as being in accordance with the rights attaching to the B Shares and shall not involve a variation of such rights for any purpose or require the consent of the holders of B Shares. (ii) A reduction by the company of the capital paid up or credited as paid up on the B Shares and the cancellation of such shares shall be treated as being in accordance with the rights attaching to the B Shares and shall not involve a variation of such rights for any purpose. The company will be authorised to reduce its capital (subject to the confirmation of the Court in accordance with the legislation and without obtaining the consent of the holders of the B Shares) including by paying to the holders of the B Shares the preferential amounts to which they are entitled as set out above. (iii) If at any time a currency other than pounds sterling is accepted as legal tender in the United Kingdom in place of or in addition to pounds sterling  the directors shall be entitled  without the consent of ordinary shareholders or holders of the B Shares  to make such arrangements and adjustments in respect of the method of calculation and payment of any of the entitlements of holders of B Shares under these articles as the directors consider necessary  fair and reasonable in the circumstances to give effect to the rights attaching to the B Shares  including (without limitation) in respect of the calculation and payment of the B Share Continuing Dividend  notwithstanding the fact of such acceptance. Any such arrangements and adjustments shall not involve a variation of any rights attaching to the B Shares for any purpose. (G) Conversion into Ordinary Shares at the Company's Option (i) The company may (subject to the provisions of the legislation) at any time after the Company's AGM to be held in 2007 on the giving of not less than 10 days' nor more than 42 days' notice in writing to the holders of the B Shares  convert all but not some only of the outstanding B Shares into ordinary shares on the date specified in the notice (the ""Conversion Date""). The conversion shall be on the basis of one ordinary share for every (M/155) B Shares (where M represents the average of the closing mid-market quotations in pence of the ordinary shares on the London Stock Exchange  as derived from the Daily Official List for the five Business Days immediately preceding the Conversion Date)  fractional entitlements being disregarded and the balance of such shares (including any fractions) shall be Deferred Shares  which shall have the same rights and be subject to the same restrictions as the Deferred Shares of 1 pence set out in article 3A(I). The company shall use its reasonable endeavours to list the ordinary shares into which B Shares are converted on the London Stock Exchange if on the Conversion Date the company's ordinary shares are also so listed. (ii) Conversion of the B Shares may be effected in such manner as the directors shall from time to time determine (subject to the provisions of the legislation) including  without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing  in accordance with the provisions of article 3A(G)(iii) or the provisions of article 3A(G)(iv) pursuant to the authority given by the passing of the resolution to create the B Shares. (iii) If the aggregate nominal value of the B Shares is lower than the aggregate nominal value of the ordinary shares into which the B Shares will convert on the Conversion Date  the directors may effect conversion by: (a) capitalising an amount of share premium account equal to the difference between the aggregate nominal value of the B Shares and the aggregate nominal value of the ordinary shares into which those B Shares are to convert (the ""Shortfall Amount"")  and applying such amount in allotting to the holders of the B Shares (in proportion to their holdings of B Shares) and paying up in full a number of undesignated shares (with such par value as the directors may determine) having an aggregate nominal value equal to the Shortfall Amount; and (b) in respect of each holder or joint holders consolidating the B Shares and the undesignated shares allotted pursuant to (a) above into one share and sub-dividing and redesignating such share into: (x) the number of ordinary shares to which that holder is entitled on conversion; and (y) a number of deferred shares of nominal value equal to the highest amount that will not result in any holder or holders being entitled to a fraction of such a deferred share  such deferred shares having an aggregate nominal value equal to the sum of the aggregate nominal value of the B Shares held by the relevant holder or holders less the aggregate nominal value of the ordinary shares referred to in (x) above  and otherwise having the rights and being subject to the restrictions set out in article 3A(I). (iv) If the aggregate nominal value of the B Shares is lower than the aggregate nominal value of the ordinary shares into which the B Shares will convert on the Conversion Date and if the company does not have sufficient reserves available to effect conversion in the manner described in article 3A(G)(iii)  the directors may effect conversion by consolidating into one share all the B Shares held by any holder or joint holders at the Conversion Date and sub-dividing such share into the appropriate number of ordinary shares and such ordinary shares  notwithstanding that they may have a different nominal amount from the other ordinary shares then in issue  shall form a uniform class with the other ordinary shares then in issue and shall  subject to article 3A(G)(v) but notwithstanding any other contrary provision herein  for all purposes and in all respects (including  without limitation  entitlement to dividends or other distributions  participation in offers  voting rights  and rights on a liquidation or return of capital) rank pari passu with the other ordinary shares then in issue  for which purposes the nominal amount of each ordinary share arising on such consolidation and sub-division shall be deemed to be the same as the nominal amount per ordinary share then in issue. (v) Any ordinary shares arising on conversion of the B Shares shall rank pari passu with the ordinary shares already in issue at the date of conversion in all respects save that such ordinary shares shall not be entitled to any dividend or other distribution declared  paid or made by reference to a record date prior the Conversion Date. (vi) If the company exercises its rights of conversion  the period commencing on the Payment Date preceding the Conversion Date and ending on such Conversion Date is called the ""Final Calculation Period"" and the B Share Continuing Dividend in respect of such period shall be payable in arrear on the final Business Day of such period (the ""Final Payment Date""). In respect of the Final Calculation Period (if any)  the amount of the B Share Continuing Dividend shall be the relevant proportion of the B Share Continuing Dividend which would have been payable if conversion had taken effect on the last day of the then current Calculation Period  the relevant proportion being the number of days from and including the last Payment Date to  but excluding  the Final Payment Date  divided by 365. The aggregate amount of the B Share Continuing Dividend payable to each holder of B Shares shall be rounded down to the nearest 1/10 penny. (H) Deletion of Article 3A(A) to (H) when no B Shares in existence Article 3A(A) to (H) shall remain in force until there are no longer any B Shares in existence whether by way of conversion into Deferred Shares  purchase and cancellation or conversion into ordinary shares  whichever is earlier  notwithstanding any provision in the articles to the contrary. Thereafter article 3A(A) to (H) shall be and shall be deemed to be of no effect (save to the extent that the provisions of article 3A(A) to (H) are referred to in other articles) and shall be deleted and replaced with the wording 'Article 3A(A) to (H) has been deleted'  and the separate register for the holders of B Shares shall no longer be required to be maintained by the company; but the validity of anything done under article 3A(A) to (H) before that date shall not otherwise be affected and any actions taken under article 3A(A) to (H) before that date shall be conclusive and shall not be open to challenge on any grounds whatsoever. (I) Deferred Shares (i) Income The Deferred Shares shall confer no right to participate in the profits of the company. (ii) Capital On a return of capital on a winding-up (excluding any intra-group re-organisation on a solvent basis) there shall be paid to the holders of the Deferred Shares the nominal capital paid up or credited as paid up on such Deferred Shares after: (a) first  paying to the holders of the B Shares 155 pence per B Share held by them together with any outstanding entitlement to the B Share Continuing Dividend up to the Payment Date last preceding the return of capital; and (b) secondly  paying to the ordinary shareholders the nominal capital paid up or credited as paid up on the ordinary shares held by them respectively  together with the sum of ¬£100 000 000 on each ordinary share. The holders of the Deferred Shares shall not be entitled to any further right of participation in the assets of the company. (iii) Attendance and Voting at General Meetings The holders of the Deferred Shares shall not be entitled to receive notice of any general meeting of the company or to attend  speak or vote at any such meeting. (iv) Form The Deferred Shares shall not be listed on any stock exchange nor shall any share certificates be issued in respect of such shares. The Deferred Shares shall not be transferable except in accordance with article 3A(l)(vi) below or with the written consent of the directors. (v) Class Rights The company may from time to time create  allot and issue further shares  whether ranking pari passu with or in priority to the Deferred Shares  and on such creation  allotment or issue any such further shares (whether or not ranking in any respect in priority to the Deferred Shares) shall be treated as being in accordance with the rights attaching to the Deferred Shares and shall not involve a variation of such rights for any purpose or require the consent of the holders of the Deferred Shares. The reduction by the company of the capital paid up on the Deferred Shares shall be in accordance with the rights attaching to the Deferred Shares and shall not involve a variation of such rights for any purpose and the company shall be authorised at any time to reduce its capital (subject to the confirmation of the Court in accordance with the legislation) without obtaining the consent of the holders of the Deferred Shares. (vi) Transfer and Purchase The company may at any time (and from time to time) (subject to the provisions of the legislation)  without obtaining the sanction of the holder or holders of the Deferred Shares: (a) appoint any person to execute on behalf of any holder of Deferred Shares a transfer of all of the Deferred Shares or any part thereof (and/or an agreement to transfer the same) to the company or to such person as the directors may determine (whether or not an officer of the company)  in any case for not more than 1 pence for all the Deferred Shares then being purchased from him; and (b) cancel all or any of the Deferred Shares so purchased by the company in accordance with the legislation. (J) Deletion of Article 3A(I) to (J) when no Deferred Shares in existence Article 3A(I) to (J) shall remain in force until there are no longer any Deferred Shares in existence  notwithstanding any provision in the articles to the contrary. Thereafter article 3A(I) to (J) shall be and shall be deemed to be of no effect (save to the extent that the provisions of article 3A(I) to (J) are referred to in other articles) and shall be deleted and replaced with the wording 'Article 3A(I) to (J) has been deleted'  and the separate register for the holders of Deferred Shares shall no longer be required to be maintained by the company; but the validity of anything done under article 3A(I) to (J) before that date shall not otherwise be affected and any actions taken under article 3A(I) to (J) before that date shall be conclusive and shall not be open to challenge on any grounds whatsoever. 3B. Rights Attached to C Shares and Deferred C Shares Notwithstanding articles 3A and 4 the C Shares (as defined below) shall have the rights attaching to shares set out in these articles save that in the event of a conflict between any provision in this article 3B and any other provision in these articles  the provisions in this article 3B shall prevail. (A) Election Form (i) Together with a circular to shareholders dated 24 November 2006 ordinary shareholders were sent a form of election relating to non-cumulative preference shares of 1 penny each (the '' C Shares'' ) (the '' C Share Election Form'' ) under which they could elect in relation to any C Shares to be issued to them to: (a) participate in a sale to Deutsche Bank AG  London Branch of the C Shares (the '' Initial C Share Purchase Offer'' ); or (b) retain C Shares and receive the C Share Continuing Dividend (as defined below). (ii) Holders of C Shares who have not returned a duly completed C Share Election Form by 3.00pm on 11 January 2007 (or such later time and/or date as the directors may determine) electing (revocably until that time) to accept the Initial C Share Purchase Offer or to retain their C Shares and receive the C Share Continuing Dividend will be deemed instead to have elected to receive the Single C Share Dividend in relation to each C Share held by them. (iii) The directors may  if they so determine in their absolute discretion  accept a C Share Election Form which is received after the relevant time or which is not correctly completed. The directors may  in addition  if they so determine in their absolute discretion  treat any other document or action as a valid C Share Election Form or as the completion or delivery of a valid C Share Election Form  as the case may be. (B) Income (i) Out of the profits available for distribution  a single dividend of 159 pence (the ''Single C Share Dividend'') shall be payable in respect of each C Share whose holder has elected  or deemed to have elected  to receive the Single C Share Dividend. (ii) Such dividend shall  if declared by resolution of the directors  or a duly authorised committee thereof  become payable on 15 January 2007 or such later date as the directors may determine (the ''Single C Share Dividend Date''). Each C Share in respect of which such dividend becomes payable shall  on such date (or such other date as the directors may determine)  be automatically converted into a deferred C share of 1 penny nominal value with the rights and restrictions described in article 3B(I) (a ''Deferred C Share''). (iii) Out of the profits available for distribution in respect of each financial year or other accounting period of the company  the holders of the C Shares who have elected to retain their C Shares shall be entitled  in priority to any payment of dividend or other distribution to the ordinary shareholders and before profits are carried to reserves but after the payment of the B Share Continuing Dividend to the holders of the B Shares  to be paid a non-cumulative preferential dividend (the ''C Share Continuing Dividend'') at such annual rate on a value of 159 pence per C Share as is calculated in accordance with article 3B(B)(v) below rounded down to the nearest 1/10 penny (exclusive of any associated tax credit relating thereto). (iv) The first C Share Continuing Dividend will be in respect of the period commencing on the Single C Share Dividend Date and is to be paid in arrear on 14 January 2008 (or such later date as the directors may determine) and thereafter  such dividend will be paid (without having to be declared) annually in arrear on 14 January (or such later date as the directors may determine) in each year or  if any such date would otherwise fall on a date which is not a Business Day (as defined below) it shall be postponed to the next day which is a Business Day (without any interest or payment in respect of such delay) (each  a ''C SharePayment Date''). (v) Each twelve month period ending on 14 January is called a ''C ShareCalculation Period''. The annual rate applicable to each C Share Calculation Period shall be the Bank of England's Bank Rate (or  if such rate is for any reason unavailable  such other rate as the directors determine to be  in their absolute discretion  an appropriate alternative or replacement therefor) prevailing on the first Business Day of such C Share Calculation Period. (vi) In this article  the expression ''Business Day'' means a day upon which commercial banks are generally open in London; and ''non-cumulative'' in relation to the C Share Continuing Dividend means that the dividend payable on each C Share Payment Date is payable out of the profits of the company available for distribution in respect of the accounting reference period in which the C Share Payment Date falls (including any reserves representing profits made in previous accounting reference periods) without any right in the case of a deficiency to resort to profits made in subsequent accounting reference periods. (vii) Payments of the C Share Continuing Dividend under article 3B(B)(iv) shall be made to holders on the company's relevant register on a date selected by the directors  being not less than 15 days nor more than 42 days (or  in default of selection by the directors  on the date falling 15 days) prior to the relevant C Share Payment Date. (viii) The holders of the C Shares shall not be entitled to any further right of participation in the profits of the company. (ix) All C Share Continuing Dividends payable on the C Shares which are unclaimed for a period of six years from the date of due payment shall be forfeited and shall revert to the company. (C) Capital (i) Except as provided in article 3B(F) below  on a return of capital on winding-up (excluding any intra-group reorganisation on a solvent basis)  the holders of the C Shares shall be entitled  in priority to any payment to the ordinary shareholders but after any payments required to be made to the holders of the B Shares  to 159 pence per C Share held by them  together with a sum equal to the relevant proportion of the C Share Continuing Dividend (if any) under article 3B(B)(iii) which would have been payable if the winding-up had taken effect on the last day of the then current C Share Calculation Period  the relevant proportion being the number of days from and including the preceding C Share Payment Date (or  if the date of such winding-up is prior to 15 January 2007  the Single C Share Dividend Date) to  but excluding  the date of such winding-up  divided by 365. (ii) The aggregate entitlement of each holder of C Shares on a winding-up in respect of all of the C Shares held by him shall be rounded up to the nearest whole penny. (iii) The holders of the C Shares shall not be entitled to any further right of participation in the profits or assets of the company in excess of that specified in article 3B(C)(i) above. If on such a winding-up the amounts available for payment are insufficient to cover in full the amounts payable on the C Shares  the holders of such shares will share rateably in the distribution of assets (if any) in proportion to the full preferential amounts to which they are entitled. (D) Attendance and Voting at General Meetings (i) The holders of the C Shares shall not be entitled  in their capacity as holders of such shares  to receive notice of any general meeting of the company nor to attend  speak or vote at any such general meeting unless: (a) the business of the meeting includes the consideration of a resolution for the winding-up (excluding any intra-group reorganisation on a solvent basis) of the company  in which case the holders of the C Shares shall have the right to attend the general meeting and shall be entitled to speak and vote only on any such resolution; or (b) at the date of the notice convening the meeting  the C Share Continuing Dividend has remained unpaid for six months or more from any C Share Payment Date  in which case the holders of the C Shares shall have the right to attend the general meeting and shall be entitled to speak and vote on all resolutions. (ii) Whenever the holders of the C Shares are entitled to vote at a general meeting of the company  on a show of hands every holder thereof who (being an individual) is present in person or (being a corporation) by a representative shall have one vote  and on a poll every such holder shall have such number of votes as he would have been entitled to exercise had he been the holder of such number of ordinary shares as would have arisen if the C Shares registered in the name of such holder had been converted into such ordinary shares immediately prior to the deadline for determining entitlements to vote at such meeting in accordance with the rights of the C Shares. (E) Company's Right to Purchase Subject to the provisions of the legislation and to compliance with applicable securities law and regulations but without the need to obtain the sanction of a special resolution of the holders of the C Shares  the company may at any time and at its sole discretion purchase C Shares (a) in the market or (b) by tender available alike to all holders of C Shares or (c) by private treaty  in each case at a price and upon such other terms and conditions as the directors may think fit. (F) Class Rights (i) The company may from time to time create  allot and issue further shares  whether ranking pari passu with or in priority to the C Shares. The creation  allotment or issue of any such further shares (whether or not ranking in any respect in priority to the C Shares) shall be treated as being in accordance with the rights attaching to the C Shares and shall not involve a variation of such rights for any purpose or require the consent of the holders of C Shares. (ii) A reduction by the company of the capital paid up or credited as paid up on the C Shares and the cancellation of such shares shall be treated as being in accordance with the rights attaching to the C Shares and shall not involve a variation of such rights for any purpose. The company will be authorised to reduce its capital (subject to the confirmation of the Court in accordance with the legislation and without obtaining the consent of the holders of the C Shares) including by paying to the holders of the C Shares the preferential amounts to which they are entitled as set out above. (iii) If at any time a currency other than pounds sterling is accepted as legal tender in the United Kingdom in place of or in addition to pounds sterling  the directors shall be entitled  without the consent of ordinary shareholders or holders of the C Shares  to make such arrangements and adjustments in respect of the method of calculation and payment of any of the entitlements of holders of C Shares under these articles as the directors consider necessary  fair and reasonable in the circumstances to give effect to the rights attaching to the C Shares  including (without limitation) in respect of the calculation and payment of the C Share Continuing Dividend  notwithstanding the fact of such acceptance. Any such arrangements and adjustments shall not involve a variation of any rights attaching to the C Shares for any purpose. (G) Conversion into Ordinary Shares at the Company's Option (i) The company may (subject to the provisions of the legislation) at any time after the company's AGM to be held in 2008 on the giving of not less than 10 days' nor more than 42 days' notice in writing to the holders of the C Shares  convert all but not some only of the outstanding C Shares into ordinary shares on the date specified in the notice (the ''C ShareConversion Date''). The conversion shall be on the basis of one ordinary share for every (M/159) C Share (where M represents the average of the closing mid-market quotations in pence of an ordinary share on the London Stock Exchange  as derived from the Daily Official List for the five Business Days immediately preceding the C Share Conversion Date)  fractional entitlements being disregarded and the balance of such shares (including any fractions) shall be Deferred C Shares  which shall have the same rights and be subject to the same restrictions as the Deferred C Shares of 1 penny set out in article 3B(I). The company shall use its reasonable endeavours to list the ordinary shares into which C Shares are converted on the London Stock Exchange if on the C Share Conversion Date the company's ordinary shares are also so listed. (ii) Conversion of the C Shares may be effected in such manner as the directors shall from time to time determine (subject to the provisions of the legislation) including  without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing  in accordance with the provisions of article 3B(G)(iii) or the provisions of article 3B(G)(iv) pursuant to the authority given by the passing of the resolution to create the C Shares. (iii) If the aggregate nominal value of the C Shares is lower than the aggregate nominal value of the ordinary shares into which the C Shares will convert on the C Share Conversion Date  the directors may effect conversion by: (a) capitalising an amount of share premium account equal to the difference between the aggregate nominal value of the C Shares and the aggregate nominal value of the ordinary shares into which those C Shares are to convert (the '' C Share Shortfall Amount '')  and applying such amount in allotting to the holders of the C Shares (in proportion to their holdings of C Shares) and paying up in full a number of undesignated shares (with such par value as the directors may determine) having an aggregate nominal value equal to the C Share Shortfall Amount; and (b) in respect of each holder or joint holders consolidating the C Shares and the undesignated shares allotted pursuant to (a) above into one share and sub-dividing and redesignating such share into: (x) the number of ordinary shares to which that holder is entitled on conversion; and (y) a number of Deferred C Shares of nominal value equal to the highest amount that will not result in any holder or holders being entitled to a fraction of such a Deferred C Share  such Deferred C Shares having an aggregate nominal value equal to the sum of the aggregate nominal value of the C Shares held by the relevant holder or holders less the aggregate nominal value of the ordinary shares referred to in (x) above  and otherwise having the rights and being subject to the restrictions set out in article 3B(I). (iv) If the aggregate nominal value of the C Shares is lower than the aggregate nominal value of the ordinary shares into which the C Shares will convert on the C Share Conversion Date and if the company does not have sufficient reserves available to effect conversion in the manner described in article 3B(G)(iii)  the directors may effect conversion by consolidating into one share all the C Shares held by any holder or joint holders at the C Share Conversion Date and sub-dividing such share into the appropriate number of ordinary shares and such ordinary shares  notwithstanding that they may have a different nominal amount from the other ordinary shares then in issue  shall form a uniform class with the other ordinary shares then in issue and shall  subject to article 3B(G)(v) but notwithstanding any other contrary provision herein  for all purposes and in all respects (including  without limitation  entitlement to dividends or other distributions  participation in offers  voting rights  and rights on a liquidation or return of capital) rank pari passu with the other ordinary shares then in issue  for which purposes the nominal amount of each ordinary share arising on such consolidation and sub-division shall be deemed to be the same as the nominal amount per ordinary share then in issue. (v) Any ordinary shares arising on conversion of the C Shares shall rank pari passu with the ordinary shares already in issue at the date of conversion in all respects save that such ordinary shares shall not be entitled to any dividend or other distribution declared  paid or made by reference to a record date prior to the C Share Conversion Date. (vi) If the company exercises its rights of conversion  the period commencing on the C Share Payment Date preceding the C Share Conversion Date and ending on such C Share Conversion Date is called the ''Final C ShareCalculation Period'' and the C Share Continuing Dividend in respect of such period shall be payable in arrear on the final Business Day of such period (the ''Final C SharePayment Date''). In respect of the Final C Share Calculation Period (if any)  the amount of the C Share Continuing Dividend shall be the relevant proportion of the C Share Continuing Dividend which would have been payable if conversion had taken effect on the last day of the then current C Share Calculation Period  the relevant proportion being the number of days from and including the last C Share Payment Date to  but excluding  the Final C Share Payment Date  divided by 365. The aggregate amount of the C Share Continuing Dividend payable to each holder of C Shares shall be rounded down to the nearest 1/10 penny. (H) Deletion of Article 3B(A) to (H) when no C Shares in existence Article 3B(A) to (H) shall remain in force until there are no longer any C Shares in existence whether by way of conversion into Deferred C Shares  purchase and cancellation or conversion into ordinary shares  whichever is earlier  notwithstanding any provision in the articles to the contrary. Thereafter article 3B(A) to (H) shall be and shall be deemed to be of no effect (save to the extent that the provisions of article 3B(A) to (H) are referred to in other articles) and shall be deleted and replaced with the wording ''Article 3B(A) to (H) has been deleted''  and the separate register for the holders of C Shares shall no longer be required to be maintained by the company; but the validity of anything done under article 3B(A) to (H) before that date shall not otherwise be affected and any actions taken under article 3B(A) to (H) before that date shall be conclusive and shall not be open to challenge on any grounds whatsoever. (I) Deferred C Shares (i) Income The Deferred C Shares shall confer no right to participate in the profits of the company. (ii) Capital On a return of capital on a winding-up (excluding any intra-group re-organisation on a solvent basis) there shall be paid to the holders of the Deferred C Shares the nominal capital paid up or credited as paid up on such Deferred C Shares after: (a) first  paying to the holders of the B Shares 155 pence per B Share held by them together with any outstanding entitlement to the B Share Continuing Dividend up to the Payment Date last preceding the return of capital and to the holders of the C Shares 159 pence per C Share held by them together with any outstanding entitlement to the C Share Continuing Dividend up to the C Share Payment Date last preceding the return of capital; (b) secondly  paying to the ordinary shareholders the nominal capital paid up or credited as paid up on the ordinary shares held by them respectively  together with the sum of ¬£100 000 000 on each ordinary share; and (c) thirdly  paying any amount required to be paid to the holders of the Deferred Shares. The holders of the Deferred C Shares shall not be entitled to any further right of participation in the assets of the company. (iii) Attendance and Voting at General Meetings The holders of the Deferred C Shares shall not be entitled to receive notice of any general meeting of the company or to attend  speak or vote at any such meeting. (iv) Form The Deferred C Shares shall not be listed on any stock exchange nor shall any share certificates be issued in respect of such shares. The Deferred C Shares shall not be transferable except in accordance with article 3B(I)(vi) below or with the written consent of the directors. (v) Class Rights The company may from time to time create  allot and issue further shares  whether ranking pari passu with or in priority to the Deferred C Shares  and on such creation  allotment or issue any such further shares (whether or not ranking in any respect in priority to the Deferred C Shares) shall be treated as being in accordance with the rights attaching to the Deferred C Shares and shall not involve a variation of such rights for any purpose or require the consent of the holders of the Deferred C Shares. The reduction by the company of the capital paid up on the Deferred C Shares shall be in accordance with the rights attaching to the Deferred C Shares and shall not involve a variation of such rights for any purpose and the company shall be authorised at any time to reduce its capital (subject to the confirmation of the Court in accordance with the legislation) without obtaining the consent of the holders of the Deferred C Shares. (vi) Transfer and Purchase The company may at any time (and from time to time) (subject to the provisions of the legislation)  without obtaining the sanction of the holder or holders of the Deferred C Shares: (a) appoint any person to execute on behalf of any holder of Deferred C Shares a transfer of all of the Deferred C Shares or any part thereof (and/or an agreement to transfer the same) to the company or to such person as the directors may determine (whether or not an officer of the company)  in any case for not more than 1 penny for all the Deferred C Shares then being purchased from him; and (b) cancel all or any of the Deferred C Shares so purchased by the company in accordance with the legislation. (J) Deletion of Article 3B(I) to (J) when no Deferred C Shares in existence Article 3B(I) to (J) shall remain in force until there are no longer any Deferred C Shares in existence  notwithstanding any provision in the articles to the contrary. Thereafter article 3B(I) to (J) shall be and shall be deemed to be of no effect (save to the extent that the provisions of article 3B(I) to (J) are referred to in other articles) and shall be deleted and replaced with the wording ''Article 3B(I) to (J) has been deleted''  and the separate register for the holders of Deferred C Shares shall no longer be required to be maintained by the company; but the validity of anything done under article 3B(I) to (J) before that date shall not otherwise be affected and any actions taken under article 3B(I) to (J) before that date shall be conclusive and shall not be open to challenge on any grounds whatsoever. 4. Change of Name The company may change its name by resolution of the directors. 5. Rights Attached to Shares The company can issue shares with any rights or restrictions attached to them as long as this is not restricted by any rights attached to existing shares. These rights or restrictions can be decided either by an ordinary resolution passed by the shareholders or by the directors as long as there is no conflict with any resolution passed by the shareholders. These rights and restrictions will apply to the relevant shares as if they were set out in these articles. 6. Redeemable Shares Subject to any rights attached to existing shares  the company can issue shares which can be redeemed. This can include shares which can be redeemed if the holders want to do so  as well as shares which the company can insist on redeeming. The directors can decide on the terms and conditions and the manner of redemption of any redeemable share. These terms and conditions will apply to the relevant shares as if they were set out in these articles. 7. Variation of Rights If the legislation allows this  the rights attached to any class of shares can be changed in a way provided by those rights or if no such provision is made  if the change is approved either in writing by shareholders holding at least three quarters of the issued shares of that class by amount (excluding any shares of that class held as treasury shares) or by a special resolution passed at a separate meeting of the holders of the relevant class of shares. This is called a ""class meeting"". All the articles relating to general meetings will apply to any such class meeting  with any necessary changes. The following changes will also apply:- (i) a quorum will be present if at least two shareholders who are entitled to vote are present in person or by proxy who own at least one third in amount of the issued shares of the class (excluding any shares of that class held as treasury shares); (ii) any shareholder who is present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote can demand a poll; and (iii) at an adjourned meeting  one person entitled to vote and who holds shares of the class  or a proxy for such person  will be a quorum. The provisions of this article will apply to any change of rights of shares forming part of a class. Each part of the class which is being treated differently is treated as a separate class in applying this article. 8. Matters not constituting Variation of Rights If new shares are created or issued which rank equally with  or subsequent to  any other shares  or if the company purchases or redeems any of its own shares or returns capital on any class of shares of the company  the rights of the other shares will not be regarded as changed or abrogated unless the terms of those shares expressly say otherwise. 9. Shares The directors can decide how to deal with any shares in the company. They can  for instance  offer the shares for sale  reclassify them  grant options to acquire them  allot them or dispose of the shares in any other way. The directors are free to decide who they deal with  when they deal with the shares and the terms on which they deal with the shares. However  in making their decision they must take account of: (i) the provisions of the legislation relating to authority  pre-emption rights and other matters; (ii) the provisions of these articles; (iii) any resolution passed by the shareholders; and (iv) any rights attached to existing shares. 10. Payment of Commission In connection with any share issue or any sale of treasury shares for cash  the company can use all the powers given by the legislation to pay commission or brokerage. The company can pay the commission in cash or by allotting fully or partly-paid shares or other securities or by a combination of both. 11. Trusts Not Recognised The company will only be affected by  or recognise  a current and absolute right to whole shares. The fact that any share  or any part of a share  may not be owned outright by the registered owner (for example  where a share is held by one person as a nominee or otherwise as a trustee for another person) is not of any concern to the company. This applies even if the company knows about the ownership of the share. The only exceptions to this are where the rights of the kind described are expressly given by these articles or are of a kind which the company has a legal duty to recognise. 12. Suspension of Rights Where Non-Disclosure of Interest (A) The company can under the legislation send out notices to those it knows or has reasonable cause to believe have an interest in its shares. In the notice  the company will ask for details of those who have an interest and the extent of their interest in a particular holding of shares. In these articles this notice is referred to as a ""statutory notice"" and the holding of shares is referred to as the ""identified shares"". (B) When a person receives a statutory notice  that person has 14 days to comply with it. If the person does not do so or if the person makes a statement in response to the notice which is false or inadequate in some important way  the company can decide to restrict the rights relating to the identified shares and send out a further notice to the holder  known as a restriction notice. The restriction notice will take effect when it is delivered. The restriction notice will state that the identified shares no longer give the shareholder any right to attend or vote either personally or by proxy at a shareholders' meeting or to exercise any other right in relation to shareholders' meetings. (C) Where the identified shares make up 0.25 per cent. or more (in amount or in number) of the existing shares of a class (calculated exclusive of any shares of that class held as treasury shares) at the date of delivery of the restriction notice  the restriction notice can also contain the following further restrictions:- (i) the directors can withhold any dividend or part of a dividend (including scrip dividend) or other money which would otherwise be payable in respect of the identified shares without any liability to pay interest when such money is finally paid to the shareholder; and (ii) the directors can refuse to register a transfer of any of the identified shares which are certificated shares unless the directors are satisfied that they have been sold outright to an independent third party. The independent third party must not be connected with the shareholder or with any person appearing to be interested in the shares. Any sale through a recognised investment exchange or any other stock exchange outside the United Kingdom or by way of acceptance of a takeover offer will be treated as an outright sale to an independent third party. For this purpose  any associate (as that term is defined in section 435 of the Insolvency Act 1986) is included in the class of persons who are connected with the shareholder or any person appearing to be interested in the shares. In order to enforce the restriction in this sub-paragraph  the directors can give notice to the relevant shareholder requiring the shareholder to change identified shares which are CREST shares to certificated shares by the time given in the notice and to keep them in certificated form for as long as the directors require. The notice can also say that the relevant shareholder may not change any identified shares which are certificated shares to CREST shares. If the shareholder does not comply with the notice  the directors can authorise any person to instruct the Operator to change any identified shares which are CREST shares to certificated shares in the name and on behalf of the relevant shareholder. (D) Once a restriction notice has been given  the directors are free to cancel it or exclude any shares from it at any time they think fit. In addition  they must cancel the restriction notice within seven days of being satisfied that all information requested in the statutory notice has been given. Also  where any of the identified shares are sold and the directors are satisfied that they were sold outright to an independent third party  they must cancel the restriction notice within seven days of receipt of notification of the sale. If a restriction notice is cancelled or ceases to have effect in relation to any shares  any moneys relating to those shares which were withheld will be paid to the person who would have been entitled to them or as that person directs. (E) The restriction notice will apply to any further shares issued in right of the identified shares. The directors can also make the restrictions in the restriction notice apply to any right to an allotment of further shares associated with the identified shares. (F) If a shareholder receives a restriction notice  the shareholder can ask the company for a written explanation of why the notice was given  or why it has not been cancelled. The company must respond within 14 days of receiving the request. (G) If the company gives a statutory notice to a person it has reasonable cause to believe has an interest in any of its shares  it will also give a copy at the same time to the person who holds the shares. If the company does not do so or the holder does not receive the copy  this will not invalidate the statutory notice. (H) This article does not restrict in any way the provisions of the legislation which apply to failures to comply with notices under the legislation. 13. Uncertificated Shares (A) Under the uncertificated securities rules  the directors can allow the ownership of shares to be evidenced without share certificates and for these shares to be transferred through CREST. The directors can select and make arrangements for any class of shares to participate in CREST in this way  provided that the shares of the class are identical in all respects. As long as the directors comply with the uncertificated securities rules  they can also withdraw a class of shares from being transferred through CREST and from allowing ownership of them to be evidenced without share certificates. CREST shares do not form a class of shares separate from certificated shares with the same rights. (B) If the company has any shares in issue which are CREST shares  these articles apply to those shares  but only as far as they are consistent with:- (i) holding shares in an uncertificated form; (ii) transferring shares through CREST; (iii) any provision of the uncertificated securities rules; or (iv) the company exercising any of its powers or functions or doing anything through CREST  and  without affecting the general nature of this article  no provision of these articles applies so far as it is inconsistent with the maintenance  keeping or entering up by the Operator  so long as that is permitted or required by the uncertificated securities rules  of an Operator register of securities in respect of CREST shares. (C) CREST shares can be changed to become certificated shares and certificated shares can be changed to become CREST shares  provided the requirements of the uncertificated securities rules are met. (D) If under these articles or the legislation the company can sell  transfer or otherwise dispose of  forfeit  re-allot  accept the surrender of or otherwise enforce a lien over a CREST share  then  subject to these articles and the legislation  the directors may: (i) require the holder of that CREST share by written notice to change that CREST share to a certificated share within a period specified in the notice and to keep it as a certificated share for as long as the directors require; (ii) appoint any person to take any other steps  by instruction given through CREST or otherwise  in the name of the holder of that share as may be necessary to effect the transfer of that share and these steps will be as effective as if they had been taken by the registered holder of that share; and (iii) take any other action that the directors consider appropriate to achieve the sale  transfer  disposal  forfeiture  re-allotment or surrender of that share or otherwise to enforce a lien in respect of that share. (E) Unless the directors decide otherwise  CREST shares held by a shareholder will be treated as separate holdings from any certificated shares which that shareholder holds. (F) Unless the uncertificated securities rules otherwise require or the directors otherwise determine  shares which are issued or created from or in respect of CREST shares will be CREST shares and shares which are issued or created from or in respect of certificated shares will be certificated shares. (G) The company can assume that entries on any record of securities kept by it as required by the uncertificated securities rules and regularly reconciled with the relevant Operator register of securities are a complete and accurate reproduction of the particulars entered in the Operator register of securities and therefore will not be liable in respect of anything done or not done by or on its behalf in reliance on such assumption; in particular  any provision of these articles which requires or envisages action to be taken in reliance on information contained in the register allows that action to be taken in reliance on information contained in any relevant record of securities (as so maintained and reconciled). 14. Right to Share Certificates (A) When a shareholder is first registered as the holder of any class of certificated shares  the shareholder is entitled  free of charge  to one certificate for all of the certificated shares of that class which they hold. If a shareholder holds certificated shares of more than one class  the shareholder is entitled to a separate share certificate for each class. This does not apply if the legislation allows the company not to issue share certificates. (B) If a shareholder receives more certificated shares of any class  the shareholder is entitled  without charge  to a certificate for the extra shares. (C) If a shareholder transfers some of the shares represented by a share certificate  the shareholder is entitled  free of charge  to a new certificate for the balance to the extent the balance is to be held in certificated form. (D) Where a certificated share is held jointly  the company does not have to issue more than one certificate for that share. When the company delivers a share certificate to one joint shareholder  this is treated as delivery to all of the joint shareholders. (E) The time limit for the company to provide a share certificate under this article is as prescribed by the legislation or  if this is earlier  within any prescribed time limit or within a time specified when the shares were issued. 15. Replacement of Share Certificates (A) If a shareholder has two or more share certificates for shares of the same class  the shareholder can ask the company for these to be cancelled and replaced by a single new certificate. The company must comply with this request. (B) A shareholder can ask the company to cancel and replace a single share certificate with two or more certificates for the same total number of shares. The company may comply with this request. (C) A shareholder can ask the company for a new certificate if the original is:- (i) damaged or defaced; or (ii) said to be lost  stolen or destroyed. (D) If a certificate has been damaged or defaced  the company can require the certificate to be returned to it before issuing a replacement. If a certificate is said to be lost  stolen or destroyed  the company can require satisfactory evidence of this and insist on receiving an indemnity before issuing a replacement. (E) The directors can require the shareholder to pay the company's exceptional out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the issue of any certificates under this article. (F) Any one joint shareholder can request replacement certificates under this article. 16. Execution of Share Certificates Share certificates must be sealed or made effective in such other way as the directors decide  having regard to the terms of issue and any listing requirements. The directors can resolve that signatures on any share certificates can be applied to the certificates by mechanical or other means or can be printed on them or that signatures are not required. A share certificate must state the number and class of shares to which it relates and the amount paid up on those shares. 17. Share Certificates Sent at Holder's Risk Every share certificate will be sent at the risk of the member or other person entitled to the certificate. The company will not be responsible for any share certificate which is lost or delayed in the course of delivery. 18. Company's Lien on Shares Not Fully Paid The company has a lien on all partly paid shares. This lien has priority over claims of others to the shares. The lien is for any money owed to the company for the shares. The directors can decide to give up any lien which has arisen and can also decide to suspend any lien which would otherwise apply to particular shares. 19. Enforcing Lien by Sale If a shareholder fails to pay the company any amount due on the shareholder's partly paid shares  the directors can enforce the company's lien by selling all or any of them in any way they decide. The directors cannot  however  sell the shares until all the following conditions are met:- (i) the money owed by the shareholder must be payable immediately; (ii) the directors must have given notice to the shareholder. The notice must state the amount of money due  it must demand payment of this sum and state that the shareholders' shares may be sold if the money is not paid; (iii) the notice must have been served on the shareholder or on any person who is entitled to the shares by law and can be served in any way that the directors decide; and (iv) the money has not been paid by at least 14 clear days after the notice has been served. The directors can authorise any person to sign a document transferring the shares. Any such transferee will not be bound to ensure that the purchase moneys for such shares are transferred to the person whose shares have been sold  nor will any such transferee's ownership of the shares be affected by any irregularity or invalidity in relation to the sale to them. 20. Application of Proceeds of Sale If the directors sell any shares on which the company has a lien  the proceeds will first be used to pay the company's expenses associated with the sale. The remaining money will be used to pay off the amount which is then payable on the shares and any balance will be passed to the former shareholder or to any person who would otherwise be entitled to the shares by law. But the company's lien will also apply to any such balance to cover any money still due to the company in respect of the shares which is not immediately payable. The company has the same rights over the money as it had over the shares immediately before they were sold. The company need not pay over anything until the certificate representing the shares sold has been delivered to the company for cancellation. 21. Calls The directors can call on shareholders to pay any money which has not yet been paid to the company for their shares. This includes the nominal value of the shares and any premium which may be payable on those shares. The directors can also make calls on people who are entitled to shares by law. If the terms of issue of the shares allow this  the directors can do any one or more of the following:- (i) make calls at any time and as often as they think fit; (ii) decide when and where the money is to be paid; (iii) decide that the money may be paid by instalments; (iv) revoke or postpone any call. A shareholder who has received at least 14 clear days' notice giving details of the amount called and of the time and place for payment  must pay the call as required by the notice. A person remains liable jointly and severally with the successors in title to the shares held by that person to pay calls even after that person has transferred the shares to which they relate. 22. Timing of Calls A call is treated as having been made as soon as the directors have passed a resolution authorising it. 23. Liability of Joint Holders Joint shareholders are jointly and severally liable to pay any calls in respect of their shares. This means that any of them can be sued for all the money due on the shares or they can be sued together. 24. Interest Due on Non-Payment Where a call is made and the money due remains unpaid  the shareholder will be liable to pay interest on the amount unpaid from the day it is due until it has actually been paid. The directors will decide on the annual rate of interest  which must not exceed the Bank of England Bank Rate by more than five per cent. The shareholder will also be liable to pay all expenses incurred by the company as a result of the non-payment of the call. The directors can decide to forego payment of any or all of such interest or expenses. 25. Sums Due on Allotment Treated as Calls If the terms of a share require any money to be paid at the time of allotment  or at any other fixed date  the money due will be treated in the same way as a valid call for money on shares which is due on the same date. If this money is not paid  everything in these articles relating to nonpayment of calls applies. This includes articles which allow the company to forfeit or sell shares and to claim interest. 26. Power to Differentiate On or before an issue of shares  the directors can decide that shareholders can be called on to pay different amounts or that they can be called on at different times. 27. Payment of Calls in Advance The directors can accept payment in advance of some or all of the money from a shareholder before the shareholder is called on to pay that money. The directors can agree to pay interest on money paid in advance until it would otherwise be due to the company. The rate of interest will be decided by the directors  but must not exceed the Bank of England Bank Rate by more than five per cent. unless the company passes an ordinary resolution to allow a higher rate. 28. Notice if Call or Instalment Not Paid If a shareholder fails to pay the whole or any part of a call or an instalment of a call when due  the directors can send the shareholder a notice requiring payment of the unpaid amount  together with any interest accrued and any expenses incurred by the company as a result of the failure to pay. 29. Form of Notice This notice must:- (i) demand payment of the amount immediately payable  plus any interest and expenses; (ii) give the date by when the total amount due must be paid. This must be at least 14 clear days after the date of the notice; (iii) say where the payment must be made; and (iv) say that if the full amount demanded is not paid by the time and at the place stated  the company can forfeit the shares on which the call or instalment is outstanding. 30. Forfeiture for Non-Compliance with Notice If the notice is not complied with  the shares it relates to can be forfeited at any time while any amount is still outstanding. This is done by the directors passing a resolution stating that the shares have been forfeited. The forfeiture will extend to all dividends and other sums payable in respect of the forfeited shares which have not been paid before the forfeiture. The directors can accept the surrender of any share which would otherwise be forfeited. Where they do so  references in these articles to forfeiture include surrender. 31. Notice after Forfeiture After a share has been forfeited  the company will notify the person whose share has been forfeited. However  the share will still be forfeited even if such notice is not given. 32. Sale of Forfeited Shares (A) A forfeited share becomes the property of the company and the directors can sell or dispose of it on any terms and in any way that they decide. This can be with  or without  a credit for any amount previously paid up for the share. It can be sold or disposed of to any person  including the previous shareholder or the person who was previously entitled to the share by law. The directors can  if necessary  authorise any person to transfer a forfeited share. (B) After a share has been forfeited  the directors can cancel the forfeiture  but only before the share has been sold or disposed of. This cancellation of forfeiture can be on any terms the directors decide. 33. Arrears to be Paid Notwithstanding Forfeiture When a person's shares have been forfeited  the person will lose all rights as shareholder in respect of those forfeited shares. The shareholder must return any share certificate for the forfeited shares to the company for cancellation. However  the shareholder will remain liable to pay calls which have been made  but not paid  before the shares were forfeited. The shareholder also continues to be liable for all claims and demands which the company could have made relating to the forfeited share. The shareholder must pay interest on any unpaid amount until it is paid. The directors can fix the rate of interest  but it must not exceed the Bank of England Bank Rate by more than five per cent. The shareholder is not entitled to any credit for the value of the share when it was forfeited or for any consideration received on its disposal unless the directors decide to allow credit for all or any of that value. 34. Statutory Declaration as to Forfeiture (A) A director or the secretary can make a statutory declaration declaring:- (i) that they are a director or the secretary of the company; (ii) that a share has been properly forfeited under the articles; and (iii) when the share was forfeited. The declaration will be evidence of these facts which cannot be disputed. (B) If such a declaration is delivered to a new holder of a share along with a completed transfer form (if one is required)  this gives the buyer good title. The new shareholder does not need to take any steps to see how any money paid for the share is used. The new shareholder's ownership of the share will not be affected if the steps taken to forfeit  sell or dispose of the share were invalid or irregular  or if anything that should have been done was not done. 35. Transfer (A) Certificated shares Unless these articles say otherwise  any shareholder can transfer some or all of their certificated shares to another person. A transfer of certificated shares must be made in writing and either in the usual standard form or in any other form approved by the directors. (B) CREST shares Unless these articles say otherwise  any shareholder can transfer some or all of their CREST shares to another person. A transfer of CREST shares must be made through CREST and must comply with the uncertificated securities rules. (C) Entry on register The person making a transfer will continue to be treated as a shareholder until the name of the person to whom the share is being transferred is put on the register for that share. 36. Signing of Transfer (A) A share transfer form for certificated shares must be signed or made effective in some other way by  or on behalf of  the person making the transfer. (B) In the case of a transfer of a certificated share  where the share is not fully paid  the share transfer form must also be signed or made effective in some other way by  or on behalf of  the person to whom the share is being transferred. (C) If the company registers a transfer of a certificated share  it can keep the transfer form. 37. Rights to Decline Registration of Partly Paid Shares The directors can refuse to register the transfer of any shares which are not fully paid. 38. Other Rights to Decline Registration (A) Certificated shares (i) A share transfer form cannot be used to transfer more than one class of shares. Each class needs a separate form. (ii) Transfers cannot be in favour of more than four joint holders. (iii) The share transfer form must be properly stamped to show payment of any applicable stamp duty or certified or otherwise shown to the satisfaction of the directors to be exempt from stamp duty and must be delivered to the office  or any other place decided on by the directors. The transfer form must be accompanied by the share certificate relating to the shares being transferred  unless the transfer is being made by a person to whom the company was not required to  and did not send  a certificate. The directors can also ask (acting reasonably) for any other evidence to show that the person wishing to transfer the share is entitled to do so and  if the share transfer form is signed by another person on behalf of the person making the transfer  evidence of the authority of that person to do so. (B) CREST shares (i) Registration of a transfer of CREST shares can be refused in the circumstances set out in the uncertificated securities rules. (ii) Transfers cannot be in favour of more than four joint holders. (C) Renunciations Where a share has not yet been entered on the register  the directors can recognise a renunciation by that person of their right to the share in favour of some other person. Such renunciation will be treated as a transfer and the directors have the same powers of refusing to give effect to such a renunciation as if it were a transfer. 39. No Fee for Registration No fee is payable to the company for transferring shares or registering changes relating to the ownership of shares. 40. Untraced Shareholders (A) The company can sell any certificated shares at the best price reasonably obtainable at the time of the sale if:- (i) for a 12-year period  (a) the shares have been in issue either as certificated shares or as CREST shares  (b) at least three cash dividends have become payable on the shares  and (c) no dividend has been cashed during that period or otherwise satisfied by the transfer of funds to a bank account or through CREST; (ii) after the 12-year period  the company has sent a notice to the last known address the company has for the relevant shareholder or to the address at which the company can give notices under these articles  stating that it intends to sell the shares. Before sending such notice  the company must have used such efforts as it considers reasonable to trace the relevant shareholder or person entitled to the shares by law; and (iii) during the 12-year period and for three months after sending the notice referred to in (ii) above  the company has not heard from the relevant shareholder or any person entitled to the shares by law. (B) The company can also sell at the best price reasonably obtainable at the time of the sale any additional certificated shares in the company issued either as certificated shares or as CREST shares in right of any share to which paragraph (A) applies (or in right of any share so issued)  if the criteria in paragraph (A)(ii) and (iii) are satisfied in relation to the additional shares  but as if the words ""after the 12-year period"" were omitted from paragraph (A)(ii) and the words ""during the 12-year period and"" were omitted from paragraph (A)(iii)  and no dividend has been cashed on these shares or otherwise satisfied by the transfer of funds to a bank account or through CREST. (C) To sell any shares in this way  the directors can appoint anyone to transfer the shares. This transfer will be just as effective as if it had been signed by the holder  or by a person who is entitled to the shares by law. Any persons to whom the shares are transferred will not be bound to concern themselves as to what is done with the purchase moneys nor will their ownership be affected even if the sale is irregular or invalid in any way. (D) The proceeds of sale will be forfeited by the relevant shareholder who could not be traced  or the person who is entitled to that shareholder's shares by law  and will belong to the company. The company will not be liable in any respect  and will not be required to account  for any part of the proceeds to the former shareholder  any person who was entitled to such shareholder's shares by law  or any other person previously entitled to the shares in question. (E) If the company sells shares under this article  any dividend or other sum that has not been cashed or claimed in respect of those shares and that has not already been forfeited under these articles shall be forfeited and shall revert to the company when the shares are sold. The company can use those dividends or other sums for the company's benefit. 41. Transmission on Death (A) When a sole shareholder or a shareholder who is the last survivor of joint shareholders dies  that shareholder's personal representatives will be the only people who will be recognised as being entitled to that shareholder's shares. (B) If a joint shareholder dies  the surviving joint shareholder or shareholders will be the only people who will be recognised as being entitled to that shareholder's shares. (C) However  this article does not discharge the estate of any shareholder from any liability. 42. Entry of Transmission in Register A person who becomes entitled to a share as a result of the death or bankruptcy of a shareholder or some other event which gives rise to the transmission of the share by operation of law must provide any evidence of such entitlement which is reasonably required. In the case of certificated shares  the directors must note this entitlement in the register within two months of receiving such evidence. 43. Election of Person Entitled by Transmission (A) Subject to these articles  a person who becomes entitled to a share by law can either be registered as the shareholder or choose another person to become the shareholder. (B) If a person who is entitled to a certificated share by law wants to be registered as a shareholder  that person must deliver or send a notice to the company saying that they have made this decision. This notice will be treated as a transfer form. All the provisions of these articles about registering transfers of certificated shares apply to it. The directors have the same power to refuse to register a person entitled to certificated shares by law as they would have had to refuse to register a transfer by the person who was previously entitled to the shares. (C) If a person entitled to a CREST share by law wants to be registered as a shareholder  that person must do so in accordance with the uncertificated securities rules. All the provisions of these articles about registering transfers of CREST shares will apply and the same power to refuse to register a person entitled to a CREST share by law will apply as would have applied to refuse to register a transfer by the person who was previously entitled to the shares. (D) If a person who is entitled to a certificated share by law wants the share to be transferred to another person  that person must do this by signing a transfer form to the person they have selected. The directors have the same power to refuse to register the person selected as they would have had to refuse to register a transfer by the person who was previously entitled to the shares. (E) If a person who is entitled to a CREST share by law wants the share to be transferred to another person  that person must do this using CREST. The same power to refuse to register the person selected will apply as would have applied to refuse to register a transfer by the person who was previously entitled to the shares. (F) The directors can give notice requiring the person entitled to a share by law to elect either to be registered as the shareholder or to transfer the share to another person. If the notice is not complied with within 60 days of being issued the directors can withhold payment of all dividends and other sums payable in respect of the share until the requirements have been complied with. Any such withholding by the directors shall not make the company a trustee in respect of those dividends or sums. 44. Rights of Person Entitled by Transmission (A) Where a person becomes entitled to a share by law  the rights of the registered shareholder in relation to that share will cease to have effect. (B) A person who is entitled to a share by law is entitled to any dividends or other money relating to the share  even though the person is not registered as the holder of the share  on supplying evidence reasonably required to show the person's title to the share. However  the directors can send written notice to the person saying the person must either be registered as the holder of the share or transfer the share to some other person. If the person entitled to a share by law does not do this within 60 days of the notice  the directors can withhold all dividends or other money relating to the share until the person does. (C) Unless such person is registered as the holder of the share  the person entitled to a share by law is not entitled to:- (i) receive notices of shareholders' meetings or attend or vote at these meetings; or (ii) exercise any of the other rights of a shareholder in relation to these meetings  unless the directors decide to allow this. 45. Sub-division Any resolution authorising the company to sub-divide any of its shares can provide that  as between the holders of the divided shares  different rights (including deferred rights) and restrictions of a kind which the company can apply to new shares can apply to different divided shares. 46. Fractions If any shares are consolidated  consolidated and then divided or divided  the directors have power to deal with any fractions of shares which result. For example  they can decide that fractions are aggregated and sold or deal with fractions in some other way. The directors can arrange for any shares representing fractions to be entered in the register as certificated shares if they consider that this makes it easier to sell them. The directors can sell those shares to anyone  including the company  and can authorise any person to transfer or deliver the shares to the buyer or in accordance with the buyer's instructions. The buyer does not have to take any steps to see how any purchase moneys are used and the buyer's ownership will not be affected if the sale is irregular or invalid in any way. 47. Participation in General Meetings (A) The directors can make whatever arrangements they think fit to allow those entitled to do so to attend and participate in any general meeting. (B) Unless the notice of meeting says otherwise or the chair of the meeting decides otherwise  a general meeting will be treated as taking place where the chair of the meeting is at the time of the meeting. (C) Two or more persons who may not be in the same place as each other attend and participate in a general meeting if they are able to exercise their rights to speak and vote at that meeting. A person is able to exercise the right to speak at a general meeting if that person can communicate to all those attending the meeting while the meeting is taking place. A person is able to exercise the right to vote at a general meeting if that person can vote on resolutions put to the meeting (or  in relation to a poll  can vote within the required time frame) and that person's vote can be taken into account in deciding whether or not such resolutions are passed at the same time as the votes of others attending the meeting. (D) When deciding whether a person is attending or participating in a meeting by means of an electronic facility  it is immaterial where that person is or how that person is able to communicate with others who are attending and participating. (E) Where shareholders can participate at a general meeting by means of an electronic facility  any document required to be on display or available for inspection will be made available for the required period in electronic form to those persons entitled to inspect it and this will satisfy any such requirement. 48. Electronic Facilities and Satellite Meetings (A) The directors can decide to let persons entitled to attend and participate in a general meeting do so by simultaneous attendance and participation by means of an electronic facility. Shareholders present in person or by proxy by means of such electronic facility will be counted in the quorum for  and entitled to participate in  the general meeting. (B) The directors can also decide to let persons entitled to attend and participate in a general meeting do so by simultaneous attendance and participation at a satellite meeting place anywhere in the world (referred to in these articles as a satellite meeting). Shareholders present in person or by proxy at satellite meeting places shall be counted in the quorum for  and entitled to participate in  the general meeting. The satellite meeting will be treated as taking place where the chair of the meeting is at the time of the meeting and the powers of the chair will apply to the satellite meeting. The directors can appoint a person (a satellite chair) to preside at each satellite meeting. Each satellite chair will act on instructions from the chair of the meeting and can also take such action as the satellite chair considers necessary to maintain the proper and orderly conduct of the satellite meeting and shall have all powers necessary or desirable for such purposes. Any general meeting at which electronic facilities have been made available and any satellite meeting will be duly constituted and its proceedings valid if the chair is satisfied that adequate facilities have been made available to enable all members attending the meeting by whatever means and at all the meeting places to participate in the business for which the meeting has been called. All persons seeking to attend and participate in a general meeting by way of electronic facility are responsible for having in place the necessary means to enable them to do so. Subject to the right of the chair to adjourn a general meeting under these articles  any inability of a person to attend or participate in a general meeting by means of electronic facility  or any interruption to a person being so able  shall not invalidate the proceedings of that meeting. (C) Nothing in these articles authorises or allows a general meeting to be held exclusively on an electronic basis. 49. Omission or Non-Receipt of Notice (A) If any notice  document or other information relating to any meeting or other proceeding is accidentally not sent or supplied  or is not received (even if the company becomes aware of such failure to send or supply or non-receipt)  the meeting or other proceeding will not be invalid as a result. (B) A shareholder present in person or by proxy at a shareholders' meeting is treated as having received proper notice of that meeting and  where necessary  of the purpose of that meeting. 50. Changes to Arrangements for General Meetings If the directors in their discretion consider that it is impracticable or undesirable to hold a general meeting  whether generally or on the date or at the time or place",neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,negative,0.01,0.15,0.84,True,English,"['Whitbread', 'Article', 'Association', 'News Ratings Calendar Company Financials Consensus Revisions Funds', 'May One Bunhill Row London EC1Y', 'London Stock Exchange', 'Overweight Rating MT', 'De La Rue', 'Summary Quotes Charts', 'THE COMPANIES ACT', ""Directors' Shareholding Qualification"", 'Separate General Meetings', 'Deferred C Shares', 'General Powers', 'Deferred Shares', 'Whitbread PT', 'Exane cuts', 'ETFs Whitbread', 'WHITBREAD PLC', 'Joint Holders', 'Untraced Shareholders', 'Electronic Facilities', 'Access Arrangements', 'Orderly Conduct', 'Other Business', 'Incapable Member', 'Annual Retirement', 'Additional Remuneration', 'Borrowing Powers', 'Record Date', 'Strategic Reports', 'Satellite Meetings', '5-day change', 'Jan Change', 'B Shares', 'Redeemable Shares', 'Uncertificated Shares', 'Forfeited Shares', 'Model Articles', 'Limited Liability', 'Share Certificates', 'Statutory Declaration', 'Maximum Validity', 'Filling Vacancies', 'Special Resolution', 'Retiring Directors', 'Alternate Directors', 'Executive Directors', ""Directors' Fees"", ""Directors' Interests"", 'Individual Directors', 'Fixed Dividends', 'Uncashed Dividends', 'Unclaimed Dividends', 'Scrip Dividends', ""Directors' Meetings"", 'Other Rights', 'Payment Procedure', 'EDT', '1st', 'Jun.', 'Barclays', 'Ashtead', 'Investec', 'Association', 'No.', 'CONTENTS', 'Exclusion', 'Definitions', 'Name', 'Variation', 'Matters', 'Commission', 'Trusts', 'Suspension', 'Disclosure', 'Replacement', 'Execution', 'Risk', 'Lien', 'Sale', 'Application', 'Proceeds', 'Calls', 'Timing', 'Non-Payment', 'Sums', 'Allotment', 'Advance', 'Notice', 'Instalment', 'Form', 'Forfeiture', 'Non-Compliance', 'Arrears', 'Transfer', 'Signing', 'Registration', 'Partly', 'Transmission', 'Death', 'Register', 'Election', 'Person', 'Sub-division', 'Fractions', 'Participation', 'Omission', 'Non-Receipt', 'Changes', 'Quorum', 'Security', 'Health', 'Safety', 'Chair', 'Entitlement', 'Adjournments', 'Amendments', 'Resolutions', 'Votes', 'Members', 'Method', 'Voting', 'Poll', 'Continuance', 'behalf', 'Objections', 'Errors', 'Appointment', 'Proxies', 'Proxy', 'Cancellation', 'Authority', 'Number', 'Removal', 'Position', 'Vacation', 'Office', 'Expenses', 'Pensions', 'Gratuities', 'Agents', 'Delegation', 'Provision', 'Employees', 'Competence', 'Committees', 'Writing', 'Acts', 'Use', 'Seals', 'Interim', 'Calculation', 'Currency', 'Amounts', 'Reserves', 'Settlement', 'Difficulties', 'Distribution', 'Inspection', 'Records', 'Supplementary', '09:06']",2023-07-03,2023-07-04,marketscreener.com
27140,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/24450/swift-blockchain-interoperability-experimentation,Swift blockchain interoperability experimentation,Early June SWIFT  the largest interbank messaging system in the world  announced it would conduct e...,Early June SWIFT  the largest interbank messaging system in the world  announced it would conduct experiments in collaboration with a number of financial institutions to test for blockchain interoperability.Blockchain interoperability has emerged as a hot topic within the crypto space. Institutional investors are increasingly considering investments in tokenised assets. They however are confronted with various challenges since these assets are on different blockchains that are not interoperable.But first  what is blockchain interoperability?Blockchain interoperability is the idea of enabling distinct blockchain networks to interact and integrate. It would allow different blockchain protocols to actively and seamlessly communicate with each other  thereby allowing for the sharing of data between different blockchains.Blockchain interoperability would mean that any blockchain layer could transact or send messages to an outside chain  which may result in making it easier to use different blockchain networks.Notwithstanding there are many projects showing great improvements in finding a solution to interoperability  in its current state  there are no layer-1 blockchain protocols that are able to do this.Why the SWIFT interoperability project?Institutional investors are increasingly considering investments in tokenized assets as they seek new and alternative investments. These tokenized investments however are tracked on different blockchain networks.The institutions thereby face the problem of blockchains not being interoperable  with each having its own functionality or liquidity  which creates significant overhead and friction in managing and trading the assets.SWIFT wants to overcome these interoperability challenges among blockchains  which is key to the long-term scalability of the market and is aligned with the company‚Äôs focus on removing friction in international transactions.SWIFT is thereby looking to help these firms leverage their existing infrastructure by developing an interoperability model that would enable access to different blockchain platforms globally  where tokens are recorded in a way that is both compliant and secure. Not only would this help firms simplify their architecture and operations  but it also minimizes investment costs and reduces risk of technology obsolescence.SWIFT Blockchain interoperability experiment 2023Early June SWIFT has announced it would start a blockchain interoperability settlement experiment. They are thereby teaming up with Chainlink  the world‚Äôs largest Web3 services platform and several financial institutions and market infrastructures to explore blockchain interoperability for seamless tokenized asset settlements.In addition to enabling financial institutions to interact with multiple blockchain networks  SWIFT will also explore a set of non-technological considerations that are necessary for regulated institutions to interact with public blockchain networks and engage in cross-network transactions.This encompasses a range of operational  compliance  and regulatory challenges  including key focus areas like confidentiality and privacy of data  or liability and recourse when transacting with public blockchain environments.Their findings will be published later this year.SWIFT and former blockchain testsThis new round of experimentation follows a series of largely successful trials in 2022 that explored how SWIFT could integrate digital currencies and tokenized assets with the world‚Äôs existing financial ecosystem.These projects were aimed to connect SWIFT‚Äôs network to nearly every blockchain to allow traditional finance players access to digital and traditional assets on one network. Thereby a proof-of-concept was conducted with price oracle provider Chainlink which would allow traditional finance firms the ability to transact across blockchain networks.The PoC thereby utilized Chainlink‚Äôs cross-chain interoperability protocol (CCIP)  allowing SWIFT messages to instruct token transfers across nearly every blockchain network  which  if successful  would accelerate the adoption of distributed ledger technology (DLT) across capital markets and traditional finance.This collaboration with SWIFT would allow financial institutions to gain blockchain capability without replacing  developing and integrating new connectivity into legacy systems  something it said would require substantial modifications with an ‚Äúexceptionally high‚Äù cost.The Experimentation: collaborationIn a number of experiments  SWIFT will collaborate with more than a dozen major financial institutions and financial market infrastructures. These include Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Limited (ANZ)  BNP Paribas  BNY Mellon  Citi  Clearstream  Euroclear  Lloyds Banking Group  SIX Digital Exchange (SDX) and The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC)One of the main goals for SWIFT is to connect siloed blockchain networks into an interoperable system that allows financial institutions to easily interact with multiple blockchain-based networksThey thereby want to explore how institutions can use their SWIFT connection and Chainlink‚Äôs Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP)  and leverage their existing messaging network as a means to seamlessly interoperate with the multitude of blockchain networks emerging around the world  thereby efficiently instructing the transfer of tokenised value.By doing this these interactions should be made in a secured and trusted way  just like as the current means of trading traditional assets while using blockchain technology to improve efficiencies  costs and opportunities.Role of ChainlinkChainlink  a leading Web3 services platform  is a decentralized oracle network that provides secure and reliable data feeds to smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Chainlink is thereby offering oracle services that can power smart contracts on any blockchain.Web3 is the evolution of the internet to incorporate so-called state-of-the-art technology  among others blockchain networks. The major part of this evolution is decentralized access to financial systems.The use of cryptocurrencies and tokens on blockchain platforms would also allow the creation of new use cases and opportunities. Up till recently these two couldn‚Äôt be accessed with ease and simultaneously. With the advent of interoperability in Web3 this and much more will be possible.Blockchain oracles are important for real-world blockchain use. Oracles provide connectivity between on-chain systems such as decentralised applications (DApps) and smart contracts and off-chain systems  allowing data pull/push between both parties. This offers enterprises across major industries a universal gateway to any blockchain. Without oracles  these on-chain systems can only interact on the blockchain they are built for  severally limiting their application.It‚Äôs clear that as banks try to access multiple blockchains  a common connectivity layer across the various chains will be a critical building block for their adoption of on-chain finance.Chainlink will facilitate this process by providing connectivity across public and private blockchains for these experiments. Chainlink will thereby be used as an enterprise abstraction layer to securely connect the SWIFT network to the Ethereum Sepolia network  while Chainlink‚Äôs Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol will enable complete interoperability between the source and destination blockchains.Potential implementationsThe tests aim to solve the challenges presented by the multitude of networks that are not interoperable and therefore create friction in the handling of assetsThe main focus of the upcoming experiments will be to show how SWIFT‚Äôs infrastructure can be leveraged to facilitate interoperability  enabling tokenized value to be transferred between existing systems and both public and private DLT platforms with existing connectivity  standards  and messaging.The SWIFT Blockchain interoperability experiment will include a number of use cases. The first use case will involve the transfer of tokenised assets between two wallets on the same public blockchain network (Ethereum Sepolia testnet). The second involves the transfer of tokenised assets from a public blockchain (Ethereum) to a permissioned blockchain. And a third use case will test the transfer of tokenised assets from Ethereum to another public blockchain.What may it bring?The experiments will help advance the industry‚Äôs understanding about the technical and business requirements involved when interacting with and between multiple blockchain networks.They will thereby highlight the potential value of using a blockchain interoperability protocol to securely transfer data and value between legacy systems and a potentially unlimited number of blockchains.If these experiments prove to be successful  removing these frictions would aid in the institutional adoption of tokenized assets and long-term market adoption. Not only would this grow the blockchain industry in an accelerated way from where it is today  but it would clearly show capital markets the many benefits of adopting on-chain finance.This collaboration between SWIFT and Chainlink could pave the way for leading institutions like DTCC  Euroclear  BNP Paribas  BNY Mellon  Citi  and many others to issue and transact trillions of euros/dollars using smart contracts. It may help accelerate the speed at which banks can utilize blockchains.But there are other blockchain interoperability solutionsOracles are not the only solution for blockchain interoperability. There are a multitude of other protocols that have already taken steps towards interoperability. But up till now most efforts have been channelled towards providing applications with the ability to interoperate with each other within the same protocol.The progress in development interoperability solutions however varies. Some have shown more progress than other but was is certain is that developments are moving forward.Next to that protocols approach interoperability from different perspectives. Next to oracles  these include parachains  inter-blockchain communication protocols  sidechains  decentralised direct bridges and others.Parallel ParachainsInteroperable parallel parachains can be thought of as individual Layer-1 blockchains that have the ability to function in parallel within the ecosystem enabling the exchange of data. These parallel parachains are custom blockchains built to host different projects and DApps. With each parachain sharing the same architecture  cross-chain interoperability is guaranteed.Each parachain relies on a central shard within the ecosystem for cross-chain communication and security to send information from one application to another.This method is referred to as ‚Äòpooled security‚Äô that allows validators from this central shard to confirm that the information being relayed is correct against the current state of the application. If all information being exchanged can be confirmed  it is passed through to the corresponding parachain.Inter-blockchain communication (IBC)Blockchain interoperability could also be delivered using inter-blockchain communication (IBC). The IBC protocol supports a suite of cross-chain applications.By using the inter-blockchain communication protocol  chains can communicate with the creation of certificates to correspond and transact between chains. This enables users to freely exchange data and assets over blockchains.Cross-chain certificates are a scalable and efficient way of interoperability  but come with their own sets of requirements and limitations. The major limitation of this is that if a chain cannot produce certificates  direct communication is not possible so interoperability cannot be achieved.Decentralised direct bridgesAnother blockchain interoperability solution driving cross-chain activities is through decentralized direct bridges. Bridges employ so-called child chains to communicate transactions between different Layer-1‚Äôs. The bridge allows thereby seamless transferring tokens and digital assets between different blockchains through shared child chains.There are various types of bridges including direct bridges that enable quick and secure transfer of digital assets including tokens from the source chain to the destination chain without the need for intermediaries or a relay network  and Layer-2 bridges that are used for bridging assets between layer-2 networks.SidechainsAnd there is the interoperability solution that uses sidechain technology to allow for communication between chains. Sidechains are separate  independent blockchains linked to the main blockchain (mainchain) using a two-way bridge. A sidechain enables tokens or digital assets to be transferred between the mainchain and the sidechain.Sidechains require applications outside of the mainnet to communicate information from one chain to another. With sidechains  all blockchain applications work independently of one another. Sidechains can relay information across the network via the mainnet.This interoperability solution relies on cross-chain messaging to interoperate. They are thereby using a system of certificates to communicate transactions and timestamps to confirm data. This process allows for accurate validation of data sent. After these messages reach the receiving platform  they can be verified and added to the block.This interoperability solution however has its limits and depends on a lot of factors. It is limited to Proof of Stake (PoS) chains with very specific necessities  that are capable of accepting these kinds of communication. They add complexity to the blockchain design and require a lot of effort and investment for the initial setup.Final remarksBlockchain interoperability should be seen as the next step in the evolution of blockchain technology. It is clear that as banks endeavour to access multiple blockchains  a common connectivity layer across the various chains will be a critical building block for their adoption of on-chain finance.Interoperability will significantly aid real-world blockchain utility  as crypto adoption increases across the globe. The ability for linkages between on-chain and off-chain systems thereby provides incredible opportunities.Developing interoperable blockchain solutions has already taken years of development and intensive labour. Though there have already been early successes in blockchain interoperability and we are seeing a drive towards simpler and more efficient interoperable solutions  this is just the beginning.

Institutional investors are increasingly considering investments in tokenised assets. They however are confronted with various challenges since these assets are on different blockchains that are not interoperable.But first  what is blockchain interoperability?Blockchain interoperability is the idea of enabling distinct blockchain networks to interact and integrate. It would allow different blockchain protocols to actively and seamlessly communicate with each other  thereby allowing for the sharing of data between different blockchains.Blockchain interoperability would mean that any blockchain layer could transact or send messages to an outside chain  which may result in making it easier to use different blockchain networks.Notwithstanding there are many projects showing great improvements in finding a solution to interoperability  in its current state  there are no layer-1 blockchain protocols that are able to do this.Why the SWIFT interoperability project?Institutional investors are increasingly considering investments in tokenized assets as they seek new and alternative investments. These tokenized investments however are tracked on different blockchain networks.The institutions thereby face the problem of blockchains not being interoperable  with each having its own functionality or liquidity  which creates significant overhead and friction in managing and trading the assets.SWIFT wants to overcome these interoperability challenges among blockchains  which is key to the long-term scalability of the market and is aligned with the company‚Äôs focus on removing friction in international transactions.SWIFT is thereby looking to help these firms leverage their existing infrastructure by developing an interoperability model that would enable access to different blockchain platforms globally  where tokens are recorded in a way that is both compliant and secure.

Key target indications for the platforms include Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD)  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) and high-risk tibial fractures.Following the merger in October 2022  BioSenic combines the strategic positionings and strengths of Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics. The merger also enables Biosenic to add to its innovative cell therapy platform and strong IP for tissue repair protection with an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/OATO.BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com .About BioSenic technology platformsBioSenic‚Äôs technology is based on two main platforms:The allogeneic cell and gene therapy platform  developed by BioSenic with differentiated bone marrow sourced Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) that can be stored at the point of use in hospitals. Its current investigational medicinal product  ALLOB  represents a unique  proprietary approach to organ repair and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells on the site of injury after a single local injection. These cells are produced via a BioSenic's scalable manufacturing process. Following the CTA approval by regulatory authorities in Europe  BioSenic had initiated patient recruitment for the Phase IIb clinical trial with ALLOB in patients with difficult tibial fractures  using its optimized production process. ALLOB was evaluated in a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase IIb study in patients with high-risk tibial fractures  using its optimized production process  after a successful first safety and efficacy study (Phase 1/2a) on fractured long bones  with late delayed union. The patient recruitment has been halted late February 2023 with 57 patients and the new rules permitted for statistical analysis allowed BioSenic to get the main results of this trial much earlier than anticipated in the original protocol  by this mid-June 2023. In June 2023  BioSenic decided to suspend its interventional trial on fracture healing using ALLOB  following negative results obtained for the primary endpoint in the exploratory Phase IIb clinical trial with ALLOB IIb  which focused on safety and treatment timing efficacy. The Arsenic TriOxide (ATO) platform developed by Medsenic. The immunomodulatory properties of ATO have demonstrated a double basic effect on cells of the immune system. The first effect is the increase of the cell oxidative stress in activated B  T or other cells of the innate/adaptative immune system to the point they will enter a cell death program (apoptosis) and be eliminated. The second effect is potent immunomodulatory properties on several pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in inflammatory or autoimmune cell pathways. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. GvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). GvHD is primarily mediated by the transplanted immune system that can lead to severe multiorgan damage. Medsenic had been successful in a Phase II trial with its intravenous formulation  allowing arsenic trioxide to be granted an orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA and is heading towards an international Phase III confirmatory study  with a new  IP protected  oral (OATO) formulation. Moderate to Severe forms of Systemic Lupus erythematosus (SLE) is another selected target  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastro-intestinal tract) in a Phase IIa study.Systemic Sclerosis is also  part of the clinical pipeline of BioSenic. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive. This gives good grounds to launch a Phase II clinical protocol for this serious disease that badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and with no actual current effective treatment.In addition  BioSenic is developing a next-generation  off-the-shelf  enhanced viscosupplement  JTA  consisting of a unique combination of plasma proteins  hyaluronic acid (a natural component of synovial fluid in the knee) and a third active component. JTA or some derivatives intend to provide added lubrication and protection to the cartilage of the arthritic joint and to alleviate osteoarthritic pain (OA) and inflammation. In March 2023  after the identification of new OA subtypes  BioSenic delivered a new post-hoc analysis of its Phase III JTA-004 trial on knee OA with positive action on the most severely affected patient population. This new post-hoc analysis drastically changes the therapeutic profile of the combined components and allows for better patient targeting in new clinical developments. The company  which does not intend to allocate R&D resources to support the clinical development of JTA-004 itself will focus its R&D activities on the development of its autoimmune (ATO) platform.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAFran√ßois Rieger  PhD  Chief Executive OfficerTel: +33 (0)671 73 31 59investorrelations@biosenic.comInternational Media Enquiries:IB CommunicationsNeil Hunter / Michelle BoxallTel: +44 (0)20 8943 4685neil.hunter@ibcomms.agency / michelle@ibcomms.agencyFor French Investor Enquiries:Seitosei ActifinGhislaine GasparettoTel: +33 (0)1 56 88 11 22ggasparetto@actifin.frCertain statements  beliefs and opinions in this press release are forward-looking  which reflect the Company or  as appropriate  the Company directors‚Äô current expectations and projections about future events.

As a reminder  at constant rates and scope  our initial forecast for revenue growth was within a range of betw‚Ä¶,Several elements are currently impacting our business and leading us today to revise our forecasts for the 2023 financial year. As a reminder  at constant rates and scope  our initial forecast for revenue growth was within a range of between 4% and 6% while our initial forecast for ratio of Adjusted EBIT1 was within a range of between 13% and 14%. We now expect revenue growth at constant rates and scope within a range of between 0% and 4%. The ratio of Adjusted EBIT1 should now consolidate within a range of between 12% and 13% at constant exchange rates.On the one hand  we confirm the overall market growth slowdown observed during the first quarter  with decreasing volumes in many geographies while compared to 2022. On the other hand  we are facing production capacity‚Äôs limitations for dog and cat vaccines  temporary however larger than expected throughout this first semester. This situation weighs on our fixed costs‚Äô absorption as well as on our sales  given our low level of vaccine stocks. In addition to that  there is also the impact linked to the cyberattack of which we were victims on June 19  though we are not yet able to precisely measure all its consequences. Our teams remain fully mobilized to ensure business continuity and implement remediation plans with deployments currently executed with efficiency and speed.All of these elements prevent us from envisaging a catch-up by the end of the year  hence leading us today to adjust our sales forecasts for the year 2023 and subsequently our forecasts of Adjusted EBIT. The momentum of our activity remains positive in many geographies and we also remain confident about the group's 2030 forecasts that remain unchanged.1 ‚Äúcurrent operating profit before amortization of assets resulting from acquisitions‚Äù to ‚Äúrevenue‚Äù ratioA lifelong commitment to animal healthAt Virbac  we provide innovative solutions to veterinarians  farmers and animal owners in more than 100 countries around the world.

As a reminder ...,English FrenchSeveral elements are currently impacting our business and leading us today to revise our forecasts for the 2023 financial year. As a reminder  at constant rates and scope  our initial forecast for revenue growth was within a range of between 4% and 6% while our initial forecast for ratio of Adjusted EBIT1 was within a range of between 13% and 14%. We now expect revenue growth at constant rates and scope within a range of between 0% and 4%. The ratio of Adjusted EBIT1 should now consolidate within a range of between 12% and 13% at constant exchange rates.On the one hand  we confirm the overall market growth slowdown observed during the first quarter  with decreasing volumes in many geographies while compared to 2022. On the other hand  we are facing production capacity‚Äôs limitations for dog and cat vaccines  temporary however larger than expected throughout this first semester. This situation weighs on our fixed costs‚Äô absorption as well as on our sales  given our low level of vaccine stocks. In addition to that  there is also the impact linked to the cyberattack of which we were victims on June 19  though we are not yet able to precisely measure all its consequences. Our teams remain fully mobilized to ensure business continuity and implement remediation plans with deployments currently executed with efficiency and speed.All of these elements prevent us from envisaging a catch-up by the end of the year  hence leading us today to adjust our sales forecasts for the year 2023 and subsequently our forecasts of Adjusted EBIT. The momentum of our activity remains positive in many geographies and we also remain confident about the group's 2030 forecasts that remain unchanged.1 ‚Äúcurrent operating profit before amortization of assets resulting from acquisitions‚Äù to ‚Äúrevenue‚Äù ratioA lifelong commitment to animal healthAt Virbac  we provide innovative solutions to veterinarians  farmers and animal owners in more than 100 countries around the world.

After placing artificial intelligence at the core of our Collection  Disputes and CashApps solutions  we are now shaping the future of B2B credit risk management together with CreditPoint Software's teams as we build on the analysis from our Data Lake of over $4.6 billion worth of B2B transactions. Our technological advantage in AI over our competitors will only continue to assert itself and become even more evident. Working in tandem  the talents and technologies of both groups will enable Sidetrade to cement its global leadership position in Order-to-Cash.‚ÄùIntroducing CreditPoint Software and its state-of-the-art platform for instant credit risk managementFounded in 2006 in the city of Tulsa  Oklahoma  CreditPoint Software is an American software company specializing in comprehensive B2B credit risk management solutions.Following a decade of substantial R&D investment  CreditPoint Software has developed one of the world-leading cloud-based platforms that leverages real time connection and monitoring for over 20 credit rating agencies worldwide including Dun & BradstreetTM  CreditsafeTM  ExperianTM  EquifaxTM  TransUnionTM as well as S&P and MoodysTM. By standardizing external data from multiple sources within a single repository  CreditPoint Software makes it possible for companies to combine this information with their internal financial and customer data on credit risk exposure. This enables Credit Management teams to automate and streamline decision-making  thanks to the platform's unlimited configuration options  resulting in the ability to auto decide up to 100% of initial  increase and renewal decisions. The CreditPoint suite of products also includes highly configurable personalized credit application templates.Supported by customizable business rules and data points  the decision engine within CreditPoint Software secures compliance with internal credit delegations based on delegation of authority. CreditPoint Software also schedules regular reviews of current credit limits for existing clientele  while providing the option for sales teams and organizations to be made aware of credit availability so they may potentially generate additional sales. The end result: selling more to the best customers and pricing risk into the customers that may not be as healthy financially as others.What's more  CreditPoint Software's ""Onboarding Credit Application"" facilitates the initial process for customers to apply for a credit line  irrespective of whether the B2B purchasing experience is delivered offline or online. In an increasingly digitalized landscape  where digital transformation is key  providing real-time credit approval during the onboarding process of new customers becomes an essential competitive advantage for all businesses.To date  CreditPoint Software has an active portfolio of around 30 customers in North America and serves multinationals such as Nutrien  BP  Edelman and Caterpillar.In the fiscal year 2023  CreditPoint Software expects to break even  with revenue topping the $2 million mark.John C. Powers  CEO of CreditPoint Software  commented:""This deal with Sidetrade is a major step forward in our commitment to providing leading-edge solutions for B2B credit risk management. In today's uncertain economic environment  companies seek efficient solutions that anticipate risks and automate decisions to secure and increase their revenue streams. By leveraging Sidetrade's Data Lake with its predictive payment intelligence map of 21 million companies worldwide  we will deploy artificial intelligence in all our decisioning to provide companies with the risk management solution of the future. Propelled by Sidetrade's sales force and implementation resources  we will further expand this new offering throughout the United States and bring it to the European market for the first time.""Contextualizing CreditPoint Software  the solution designed for the B2B e-commerce boomWhile McKinsey & Company estimated that the majority of B2B corporations had next to no e-commerce capabilities at the start of the pandemic  the past two years have seen a rapid trend reversal. In its 2021 B2B Pulse Report   the US consulting firm found that 65% of B2B companies across all sectors offer e-commerce capabilities.A DHL study also reported that by 2025  80% of all B2B sales interactions between suppliers and professional buyers will take place digitally  representing a giant and unprecedented leap forward. And in its 2022 report  Statista expects total B2B e-commerce purchases to exceed $4.6 trillion in 2025. Clearly  e-commerce is no longer just a trendy new channel for B2B companies to discover  but instead an essential effective and strategic sales tool.Compared to B2C e-commerce  B2B e-commerce places more importance on credit and payment terms. A series of checks must be performed in real time to validate an order. However  managing such procedures instantly requires a step-by-step process. The latter involves identifying the company  integrating external financial data  decision-making and delegating approval based on the total order amount.Nevertheless  across the globe  very few companies can implement a solution to overcome the limitations of B2B e-commerce and offer a customer experience to match the B2C shopping experience.""The boom in e-commerce has revolutionized sales and consumption patterns. In B2B  the growth of e-commerce requires companies to find the right solution for the right emerging expectation. You need to determine an acceptable payment delay to minimize risk and instantly maximize sales."" commented Olivier Novasque  CEO of Sidetrade. ""For B2B companies that want to continue leading the way in their sectors  e-commerce is no longer just a nice to have  but an essential requirement. We will support them by utilizing our teams and the technology of CreditPoint Software. No matter the sector  it is a pressing need.""Focusing on the accretive acquisition of CreditPoint Software assetThis acquisition will be made in cash for an estimated ‚Ç¨3 million and paid in part on the signing of the agreement with the rest scheduled for end-2023  which is subject to certain customer renewals. The amount includes an earn out based on the sales achieved by Sidetrade for CreditPoint Software's solution over the next three years.Sidetrade is financing the transaction through its cash position  which totaled ‚Ç¨36 million (‚Ç¨12 million in treasury shares) as of June 30  2023.The transaction is part of the Group's Fusion 100 strategic plan which targets Annual Recurring Revenue (""ARR"") of $100 million by end-2025. Not only is it a catalyst for Sidetrade's product strategy  but also its target revenue for North America of close to $14 million in 2023 which will bolster the Group's presence in the United States.Sidetrade ContactsInvestor Relations Christelle Dhrif 00 33 6 10 46 72 00 cdhrif@sidetrade.comMedia Relations Rebecca Parlby +44 7824 5055 84 bparlby@sidetrade.comAbout Sidetrade ( www.sidetrade.com )Sidetrade (Euronext Growth: ALBFR.PA) provides a SaaS platform dedicated to securing and accelerating cash flow.

After placing artificial intelligence at the core of our Collection  Disputes and CashApps solutions  we are now shaping the future of B2B credit risk management together with CreditPoint Software's teams as we build on the analysis from our Data Lake of over $4.6 billion worth of B2B transactions. Our technological advantage in AI over our competitors will only continue to assert itself and become even more evident. Working in tandem  the talents and technologies of both groups will enable Sidetrade to cement its global leadership position in Order-to-Cash.‚ÄùIntroducing CreditPoint Software and its state-of-the-art platform for instant credit risk managementFounded in 2006 in the city of Tulsa  Oklahoma  CreditPoint Software is an American software company specializing in comprehensive B2B credit risk management solutions.Following a decade of substantial R&D investment  CreditPoint Software has developed one of the world-leading cloud-based platforms that leverages real time connection and monitoring for over 20 credit rating agencies worldwide including Dun & BradstreetTM  CreditsafeTM  ExperianTM  EquifaxTM  TransUnionTM as well as S&P and MoodysTM. By standardizing external data from multiple sources within a single repository  CreditPoint Software makes it possible for companies to combine this information with their internal financial and customer data on credit risk exposure. This enables Credit Management teams to automate and streamline decision-making  thanks to the platform's unlimited configuration options  resulting in the ability to auto decide up to 100% of initial  increase and renewal decisions. The CreditPoint suite of products also includes highly configurable personalized credit application templates.Supported by customizable business rules and data points  the decision engine within CreditPoint Software secures compliance with internal credit delegations based on delegation of authority. CreditPoint Software also schedules regular reviews of current credit limits for existing clientele  while providing the option for sales teams and organizations to be made aware of credit availability so they may potentially generate additional sales. The end result: selling more to the best customers and pricing risk into the customers that may not be as healthy financially as others.What's more  CreditPoint Software's ""Onboarding Credit Application"" facilitates the initial process for customers to apply for a credit line  irrespective of whether the B2B purchasing experience is delivered offline or online. In an increasingly digitalized landscape  where digital transformation is key  providing real-time credit approval during the onboarding process of new customers becomes an essential competitive advantage for all businesses.To date  CreditPoint Software has an active portfolio of around 30 customers in North America and serves multinationals such as Nutrien  BP  Edelman and Caterpillar.In the fiscal year 2023  CreditPoint Software expects to break even  with revenue topping the $2 million mark.John C. Powers  CEO of CreditPoint Software  commented:""This deal with Sidetrade is a major step forward in our commitment to providing leading-edge solutions for B2B credit risk management. In today's uncertain economic environment  companies seek efficient solutions that anticipate risks and automate decisions to secure and increase their revenue streams. By leveraging Sidetrade's Data Lake with its predictive payment intelligence map of 21 million companies worldwide  we will deploy artificial intelligence in all our decisioning to provide companies with the risk management solution of the future. Propelled by Sidetrade's sales force and implementation resources  we will further expand this new offering throughout the United States and bring it to the European market for the first time.""Contextualizing CreditPoint Software  the solution designed for the B2B e-commerce boomWhile McKinsey & Company estimated that the majority of B2B corporations had next to no e-commerce capabilities at the start of the pandemic  the past two years have seen a rapid trend reversal. In its 2021 B2B Pulse Report   the US consulting firm found that 65% of B2B companies across all sectors offer e-commerce capabilities.A DHL study also reported that by 2025  80% of all B2B sales interactions between suppliers and professional buyers will take place digitally  representing a giant and unprecedented leap forward. And in its 2022 report  Statista expects total B2B e-commerce purchases to exceed $4.6 trillion in 2025. Clearly  e-commerce is no longer just a trendy new channel for B2B companies to discover  but instead an essential effective and strategic sales tool.Compared to B2C e-commerce  B2B e-commerce places more importance on credit and payment terms. A series of checks must be performed in real time to validate an order. However  managing such procedures instantly requires a step-by-step process. The latter involves identifying the company  integrating external financial data  decision-making and delegating approval based on the total order amount.Nevertheless  across the globe  very few companies can implement a solution to overcome the limitations of B2B e-commerce and offer a customer experience to match the B2C shopping experience.""The boom in e-commerce has revolutionized sales and consumption patterns. In B2B  the growth of e-commerce requires companies to find the right solution for the right emerging expectation. You need to determine an acceptable payment delay to minimize risk and instantly maximize sales."" commented Olivier Novasque  CEO of Sidetrade. ""For B2B companies that want to continue leading the way in their sectors  e-commerce is no longer just a nice to have  but an essential requirement. We will support them by utilizing our teams and the technology of CreditPoint Software. No matter the sector  it is a pressing need.""Focusing on the accretive acquisition of CreditPoint Software assetThis acquisition will be made in cash for an estimated ‚Ç¨3 million and paid in part on the signing of the agreement with the rest scheduled for end-2023  which is subject to certain customer renewals.

This increase was mainly the result of the full-year effect of rents coming from the developments in 2022  rents ofthe warehouses delivered during the first half-year of 2023  as well as rent reviews that took place onJanuary 1  2023 (+4% on average).Significant events of the firsthalf-yearof 2023Since the beginning of the year  ARGAN pursued its development by delivering last March a logistics platform totaling 38 000 sq.m and located in Janneyrias (38) ‚Äì Lyon area ‚Äì by the A432 French highway. This platform  which is leased to BUT ‚Äì France's leading furniture retailer ‚Äì for a fixed term of 9.5 years  meets the highest standards for frugal energy choices.Under intended conditions  ARGAN also finalized last March its sale of a logistics platform of 20 000 sq.m located in Bonneuil-sur-Marne (94).Finally  ARGAN joined the EPRA Europe index on March 20  2023.A record development pipeline of over ‚Ç¨300mARGAN plans to deliver four new development projects and one extension in 2023  representing an investment volume of ‚Ç¨135m for new spaces totalling 100 000 sq.m. All these projects are already financed through amortizing mortgage loans that were taken out in 2022  before interest rates rose.After 2023  the very strong business momentum recorded in the first half of this year has already helped secure development projects representing a volume of over ‚Ç¨175m for more than 155 000 sq.m of spaces to be delivered in 2024. Half of this amount is already financed through amortizing mortgage loans and the other half should come from the sale of warehouses at the end of 2024 or early 2025  depending on market conditions.Among ongoing project developments  Argan has already announced works to extend two sites  with:The second phase for its logistics warehouse at La Cr√®che (79) leased to EURIAL  the milk division of the cooperative group AGRIAL  as part of a long-term lease covering a firm 12-year period. The two new negative cold cells represent a surface of 12 400 sq.m and will result in total spaces extended to 32 800 sq.m. This extension includes an improvement in the site‚Äôs carbon footprint  as photovoltaic panels will also be installed with a total production capacity of over 1 700 Mwh/year  thus covering 30% of the site‚Äôs energy needs. The project‚Äôs delivery is expected in December 2023;The extension of the fulfillment hub in Brugui√®res (31) leased to GEODIS  which will increase the site‚Äôs size to 13 400 sq.m. These works are also an opportunity to refurbish existing buildings and thus establish a long-term partnership with GEODIS through a new lease for a firm 12-year period. The project‚Äôs delivery is expected in December 2024.In the coming weeks  new announcements should further illustrate ARGAN‚Äôsstrong business momentum  whichprovidesvery good visibilityon future growth andrevenueof our real estate company.More broadly  the Group‚Äôs ability to pursue its growth reflects the combination of:Its identity as a pure player of the French logistics real estate market that remains buoyant   characterized by a strong demand and a limited offer ;; A proven business model that delivers growth with a long-term vision on property management based on Premium assets that meet customers‚Äô expectations both in terms of location and qualit y of tailor - made buildings ; andbased on that meet both in terms of and ; and Strong attention tothe higheststandards for frugal and efficient energy choicesbothfor ongoing and future projects under AutOnom¬Æ  the warehousethat generatesits own green energy  but also through an ambitious plan to refurbish existing facilities.As atJune 30  2023  Argans‚Äôsrental portfoliothus stoodat 3.5 million sq.m. and the occupancy rateremained at 100%.2023 rental income target for the year revised upwards to ‚Ç¨183mTaking into account theplanned delivery projects forthe second half of the year  ARGAN is revising its yearly target1 forrental income upwards to ‚Ç¨183m (compared with ‚Ç¨182m initially) for thefull-year 2023.Financial calendar 2023 (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)July 19: 2023 Half-year resultsOctober 2: 2023 3rd quarter salesAbout ArganARGAN is the only French real estate company specializing in the DEVELOPMENT & RENTAL OF PREMIUM WAREHOUSES listed on EURONEXT.As at December 31  2022  ARGAN‚Äôs portfolio amounted to 3.5 million sq.m  comprising approximately 100 warehouses located exclusively in France  valued at ‚Ç¨4.0 billion.

Our first poster at the World Glaucoma Congress presents the adaptive dose selection data  justifying the choice of the 0.1% NCX 470 dose for the rest of the trial. We have also looked across the whole trial and report is that more patients achieve a reduction of IOP of 10mmHg or more when on NCX 470 than those on latanoprost. We look forward to reporting other data at conferences and in planned publications.‚Äù said Doug Hubatsch  Chief Scientific Officer of NicoxPoster Title: NCX 470  a Nitric Oxide Donating Bimatoprost Compared with Latanoprost - Adaptive Design Period Results from the Phase 3 Mont Blanc Clinical TrialA dose finding Phase 2 trial (Dolomites) tested NCX 470 at several concentrations and the results suggested that the highest studied dose might still be below the top of the dose response curve. To test this a concentration of 0.065% and 0.1% were included in an adaptive dose selection period of the Phase 3 Mont Blanc trial  which compared the safety and efficacy of NCX 470 ophthalmic solution vs. latanoprost ophthalmic solution in adult subjects with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. At the Week 2 timepoint  NCX 470 0.065% demonstrated 1.37 mmHg greater mean diurnal IOP reduction from baseline than latanoprost and NCX 0.1% demonstrated 1.73 mmHg greater mean diurnal IOP reduction from baseline than latanoprost.The adaptive dose selection period was used in place of additional dose ranging studies to select the 0.1% concentration of NCX 470 for the duration of the 3-month Phase 3 Mont Blanc clinical trial as well as the second Phase 3 trial  Denali.Poster Title: NCX 470  a Nitric Oxide Donating Bimatoprost versus Latanoprost has Greater Proportion of Subjects Achieving ‚â•10 mmHg IOP Decrease in Phase 3 TrialNCX 470 met the primary efficacy endpoint of non-inferiority to latanoprost at all 9 of 9 timepoints measured in the Mont Blanc trial. Furthermore  NCX 470 demonstrated a statistically greater proportion of subjects with 10 mmHg or more IOP reduction compared to latanoprost at Week 2  Week 6  and Month 3 ranging from 69% to 46% in the NCX 470 group compared to 60% to 34% in the latanoprost group. NCX 470 was safe and well tolerated.Poster Title: Effects of NCX 470  a Nitric Oxide (NO)-Donating Bimatoprost  in in vitro 3D-Human Trabecular Meshwork (TM) / Schlemm's Canal (SC) Tissue ModelBioengineered 3D-human TM/SC (3D-HTM/HSCTM) constructs and Cynomolgus monkeys were used to provide insights on the cellular and molecular mechanism/s accounting for NCX 470-mediated intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering activity. NCX 470 significantly improved outflow facility in 3D-HTM/HSCTM. Furthermore  unlike most IOP-lowering agents  a clinically effective dose (0.1% ophthalmic solution) of NCX 470 affected both conventional and uveoscleral pathways to increase aqueous humor drainage from monkey eyes. NCX 470 dual-acting modality (NO and prostaglandin analog) explains the robust reduction of IOP exerted by this drug in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.About NCX 470NCX 470 is a novel NO-donating bimatoprost eye drop currently in Phase 3 clinical development for the lowering of IOP in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The first Phase 3 trial  Mont Blanc  a randomized  double-masked  multi-center  parallel group trial that was conducted in the U.S.  compared NCX 470 (0.1%) to latanoprost (0.005%) was completed in October 2022. The second Phase 3 trial  Denali  similarly designed to the Mont Blanc trial  and which includes a long-term safety extension  is ongoing.Update on planned Phase 3b trials on NCX 470The timing of the planned Phase 3b trials investigating the dual mechanism of action (nitric oxide and prostaglandin analog) in IOP lowering and potential retinal benefits of NCX 470 is currently being assessed and we will provide an update on these in the Q2 Press Release in mid-July.,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,positive,0.77,0.23,0.0,True,English,"['Mont Blanc Adaptive Design Data', 'Additional Subset Analysis', 'World Glaucoma Congress', 'NCX 470 Phase 3', 'Nicox', 'Superiority', 'Latanoprost', '1.73mmHg greater mean diurnal intraocular pressure', 'randomized, double-masked, multi-center, parallel group trial', '1.37 mmHg greater mean diurnal IOP reduction', '1.73 mmHg greater mean diurnal IOP reduction', '3-month Phase 3 Mont Blanc clinical trial', 'novel NO-donating bimatoprost eye drop', 'NCX 470-mediated intraocular pressure', 'adaptive dose selection period', 'Adaptive Design Period Results', 'additional dose ranging studies', 'Mont Blanc Phase 3 trial', 'Phase 3 Mont Blanc trial', '10th World Glaucoma Congress', 'adaptive dose selection data', 'Phase 3 clinical development', 'second Phase 3 trial', 'Phase 3b trials', 'highest studied dose', 'dose response curve', 'Euronext Growth Paris', 'international ophthalmology company', 'Chief Scientific Officer', '3D-Human Trabecular Meshwork', 'SC) Tissue Model', 'Bioengineered 3D-human TM/SC', 'aqueous humor drainage', 'potential retinal benefits', 'first Phase 3 trial', 'IOP)-lowering activity', 'primary efficacy endpoint', 'long-term safety extension', 'Q2 Press Release', 'NO)-Donating Bimatoprost', 'NCX 470 ophthalmic solution', 'NCX 470 dual-acting modality', 'latanoprost ophthalmic solution', 'Phase 2 trial', 'greater proportion', 'IOP) reduction', 'additional data', 'dose finding', 'effective dose', 'robust reduction', 'NCX 470 group', 'latanoprost group', 'open-angle glaucoma', 'IOP Decrease', '0.1% NCX 470 dose', 'first poster', 'other data', 'IOP lowering', 'Sophia Antipolis', 'large volume', 'patient subgroups', 'greatest effect', 'Doug Hubatsch', 'Poster Title', 'Nitric Oxide', 'several concentrations', 'ocular hypertension', 'Cynomolgus monkeys', 'molecular mechanism', 'outflow facility', 'IOP-lowering agents', 'uveoscleral pathways', 'monkey eyes', 'prostaglandin analog', 'U.S.', 'dual mechanism', 'Nicox SA', 'Week 2 timepoint', 'adult subjects', '10 mmHg', 'baseline', 'July', 'CET', 'France', 'ALCOX', 'WGC', 'June', 'Rome', 'Italy', 'opportunity', 'detail', 'choice', 'rest', 'report', 'patients', '10mmHg', 'conferences', 'planned', 'publications', 'Dolomites', 'place', '0.1% concentration', 'duration', 'Denali', 'inferiority', '9 timepoints', 'Effects', 'vitro', 'Schlemm', 'Canal', 'insights', 'cellular', '3D-HTM/HSCTM', 'most', 'conventional', 'drug', 'October', 'Update', 'timing', 'action', '7:30']",2023-07-03,2023-07-04,marketscreener.com

This increase was mainly the result of the full-year effect of rents coming from the developments in 2022  rents ofthe warehouses delivered during the first half-year of 2023  as well as rent reviews that took place onJanuary 1  2023 (+4% on average).Significant events of the first half-year of 2023Since the beginning of the year  ARGAN pursued its development by delivering last March a logistics platform totaling 38 000 sq.m and located in Janneyrias (38) ‚Äì Lyon area ‚Äì by the A432 French highway. This platform  which is leased to BUT ‚Äì France's leading furniture retailer ‚Äì for a fixed term of 9.5 years  meets the highest standards for frugal energy choices.Under intended conditions  ARGAN also finalized last March its sale of a logistics platform of 20 000 sq.m located in Bonneuil-sur-Marne (94).Finally  ARGAN joined the EPRA Europe index on March 20  2023.A record development pipeline of over ‚Ç¨300mARGAN plans to deliver four new development projects and one extension in 2023  representing an investment volume of ‚Ç¨135m for new spaces totalling 100 000 sq.m. All these projects are already financed through amortizing mortgage loans that were taken out in 2022  before interest rates rose.After 2023  the very strong business momentum recorded in the first half of this year has already helped secure development projects representing a volume of over ‚Ç¨175m for more than 155 000 sq.m of spaces to be delivered in 2024. Half of this amount is already financed through amortizing mortgage loans and the other half should come from the sale of warehouses at the end of 2024 or early 2025  depending on market conditions.Among ongoing project developments  Argan has already announced works to extend two sites  with:The second phase for its logistics warehouse at La Cr√®che (79) leased to EURIAL  the milk division of the cooperative group AGRIAL  as part of a long-term lease covering a firm 12-year period. The two new negative cold cells represent a surface of 12 400 sq.m and will result in total spaces extended to 32 800 sq.m. This extension includes an improvement in the site‚Äôs carbon footprint  as photovoltaic panels will also be installed with a total production capacity of over 1 700 Mwh/year  thus covering 30% of the site‚Äôs energy needs. The project‚Äôs delivery is expected in December 2023;The extension of the fulfillment hub in Brugui√®res (31) leased to GEODIS  which will increase the site‚Äôs size to 13 400 sq.m. These works are also an opportunity to refurbish existing buildings and thus establish a long-term partnership with GEODIS through a new lease for a firm 12-year period. The project‚Äôs delivery is expected in December 2024.In the coming weeks  new announcements should further illustrate ARGAN‚Äôs strong business momentum  which provides very good visibility on future growth and revenue of our real estate company.More broadly  the Group‚Äôs ability to pursue its growth reflects the combination of:Its identity as a pure player of the French logistics real estate market that remains buoyant   characterized by a strong demand and a limited offer ;; A proven business model that delivers growth with a long-term vision on property management based on Premium assets that meet customers‚Äô expectations both in terms of location and qualit y of tailor - made buildings ; andbased on that meet both in terms of and ; and Strong attention to the highest standards for frugal and efficient energy choices both for ongoing and future projects under AutOnom¬Æ  the warehouse that generates its own green energy  but also through an ambitious plan to refurbish existing facilities.As at June 30  2023  Argans‚Äôs rental portfolio thus stood at 3.5 million sq.m. and the occupancy rate remained at 100%.2023 rental income target for the year revised upwards to ‚Ç¨183mTaking into account the planned delivery projects for the second half of the year  ARGAN is revising its yearly target1 for rental income upwards to ‚Ç¨183m (compared with ‚Ç¨182m initially) for thefull-year 2023.Financial calendar 2023 (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)July 19: 2023 Half-year resultsOctober 2: 2023 3rd quarter salesAbout ArganARGAN is the only French real estate company specializing in the DEVELOPMENT & RENTAL OF PREMIUM WAREHOUSES listed on EURONEXT.As at December 31  2022  ARGAN‚Äôs portfolio amounted to 3.5 million sq.m  comprising approximately 100 warehouses located exclusively in France  valued at ‚Ç¨4.0 billion.

This approval and waiver will be valid provided the Spin-Off occurs on or before 31 December 2024.The Issuer is currently considering the exact Transaction structure  including separation of its businesses by way of the Spin-Off (i.e. full spin-off of BRS whereby BRS shall no longer be consolidated within the Issuer‚Äôs group) or partial spin-off of BRS whereby BRS shall remain consolidated within the Issuer‚Äôs group. The Issuer intends to take into account the results of the Consent Solicitation for the purposes of determining the appropriate Transaction structure and will assess its options as to implementation of the full or partial spin-off of BRS  bearing in mind that the partial spin-off does not require the approval of the Bondholders.The Consent Solicitation is being made on the terms and subject to the conditions set out in the Consent Solicitation Memorandum dated July 3  2023 (the ‚ÄúConsent Solicitation Memorandum‚Äù). Capitalised terms used in this announcement but not defined have the meanings given to them in the Consent Solicitation Memorandum.THE DEADLINE FOR RECEIPT BY THE INFORMATION AND TABULATION AGENT OF ELECTRONIC VOTING INSTRUCTIONS FROM BONDHOLDERS WISHING TO VOTE IN FAVOUR OF THE RELEVANT EXTRAORDINARY RESOLUTION AND TO BE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE THE EARLY VOTING FEE IS 5.00 P.M. (PARIS TIME) ON JULY 13  2023  AS MAY BE EXTENDED OR AMENDED AT THE SOLE AND ABSOLUTE DISCRETION OF THE ISSUER.The ProposalSodexo (the ‚ÄúIssuer‚Äù) is a global leader in quality-of-life services. The business of the Issuer is currently built around two business units:On-Site Services (‚ÄúOSS‚Äù) which provides food and facility management services for companies  campuses  governments  healthcare & seniors and schools. Food services include an increasing range of services on top of the traditional onsite restaurants  with on-site and off-site production  click & collect  smart fridges  delivery and commissiary services; and Benefits & Rewards Services operating under the name ‚ÄúPluxee‚Äù (‚ÄúBRS‚Äù) which provides a wide range of employee benefits  focused on meal and food benefits  as well as a range of other connected activities  such as employee rewards & recognition  engagement  gift cards  public benefits delivered through paper vouchers  cards  etc. and fuel & fleet management.On April 5  2023  the Issuer announced that its Board has unanimously approved the potential Transaction which is expected to take place in 2024 subject to market conditions and following the completion of a number of customary steps  including consultation of the employee representative bodies.Detailed Transaction parameters and terms will be presented at a later stage and submitted to the approval of the Issuer‚Äôs Board and shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting. The main shareholder of Sodexo  Bellon S.A.  holding 42.75% of share capital and 57.5% of the exercisable voting rights of the Issuer as at the date of the Consent Solicitation Memorandum  has indicated its support for the potential Transaction and its intention to continue to play a long-term controlling shareholder role in both OSS and BRS.The potential Transaction is not expected to have any negative impact on strategy  operational or financial conditions or the rating profile of the Issuer. It can be explained by the limited synergies existing between OSS and BRS which have different growth and profitability drivers  different business models  different client bases and different geographies.OSS Net Debt resulting from the Spin-Off assumes an improvement of OSS‚Äô cash position in excess of 1.0 billion euros  by way of (i) a repayment by BRS to the Issuer of its existing intercompany loan in the amount of approximately 545 million euros and (ii) a debt allocation to BRS from the Issuer in an amount of approximately 500 million euros at the time of completion of the Spin-Off. These numbers remain indicative as of the date hereof and subject to finalization of the Spin-Off structure.It is important to note that the Issuer remains committed to its long-standing target net debt ratio1 of 1.0x - 2.0x  and a strong investment grade rating following the Spin-Off as has been clearly stated in the April 2023 announcements of both the Issuer and its major shareholder Bellon SA. Given the robust cash generation and increase in EBITDA expected during Fiscal Year 2023  combined with the cash improvement outlined above  the Issuer intends to reduce its net debt ratio so that it would fall close to the targeted range within 12 to 18 months of the Spin-Off completion  and would remain within that range over the medium term. This is in line with the Issuer‚Äôs clear track record of maintaining a conservative financial policy over many years.The Issuer expects that as a result of the implementation of the Transaction the rating of both the Bonds and the Issuer will remain stable at BBB+ from S&P Global Ratings Europe Ltd (‚ÄúS&P‚Äù) and Baa1 from Moody‚Äôs France S.A.S (‚ÄúMoody‚Äôs‚Äù)  respectively. In addition  the Issuer also initiated a rating by Fitch Ratings Ireland Limited (‚ÄúFitch‚Äù) that assigned the rating of BBB+ to the Issuer and expects that as a result of the implementation of the Transaction the rating of the Issuer assigned by Fitch will remain stable at BBB+. Therefore  the potential Transaction  including by way of the Spin-Off  is not expected to have any impact on the solvency of the Issuer and its financial structure would remain solid.In anticipation of the potential Transaction  the Issuer obtained unconditional approvals of the Transaction from its lender creditors under the Revolving Credit Facilities.The Issuer  therefore  seeks approval by the Bondholders of the Proposal in case the Issuer subsequently decides to implement the potential Transaction by way of the Spin-Off.The Proposed Modifications in relation to each Series of Bonds described in the Consent Solicitation Memorandum shall be conditional upon each Consent Solicitation in relation to each other Series of Bonds being successful (the ‚ÄúCross Condition‚Äù)  provided that the Issuer reserves the right to  in its sole discretion  waive the Cross Condition at any time before the notice of results of the relevant Meeting is published by the Issuer.Assuming the passing of the relevant Extraordinary Resolution at the Meeting of any Series of Bonds  such Extraordinary Resolution will be binding on all the Bondholders of such Series  including those Bondholders of such Series who do not vote in favour of such Extraordinary Resolutions or who do not attend the Meeting and/or vote.The Early Voting FeesSubject to (i) the Extraordinary Resolution relating to the Meeting of the Bondholders being duly passed at the Meeting or at an Adjourned Meeting of such first convened Meeting  as the case may be  (ii) the Issuer not having previously terminated the Consent Solicitation in accordance with the provisions for such termination set out in the Consent Solicitation Memorandum  and (iii) the Cross Condition being satisfied or waived  each Bondholder who submits an Electronic Voting Instruction in favour of the Extraordinary Resolution relating to the Meeting of the Bondholders which is received by the Information and Tabulation Agent on or prior to the Early Instruction Deadline and does not subsequently validly revoke such instruction  shall be eligible to receive a one-time cash payment in an amount of 0.25 per cent. of the principal amount of its Bonds of such Series specified in the table above which are the subject of such Electronic Voting Instruction (an ‚ÄúEarly Voting Fee‚Äù).Expected timetableThe times and dates below are indicative only.

27221,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.independent.ie/business/irish/monday-insight-medtech-firm-healthbeacon-targeting-prosperity-in-us-market/a1483781853.html,Monday Insight: Medtech firm HealthBeacon targeting prosperity in US market,HealthBeacon is finding its stride. ‚ÄúWe feel really  really good about our US business ‚Äù says Jim Joyce  the company‚Äôs founder and chief executive.,HealthBeacon is finding its stride. ‚ÄúWe feel really  really good about our US business ‚Äù says Jim Joyce  the company‚Äôs founder and chief executive.Joyce anticipates that a sense of growing momentum across the Atlantic will help the medtech firm pave a way towards profitability.HealthBeacon  which listed on Euronext Dublin in 2021  develops smart tools to assist patients to manage their medications from their homes. The company‚Äôs smart sharp bins remind patients when to take necessary injections.Mr Joyce founded the company 10 years ago following a decade spent working in the pharmaceutical industry. There he learned more about patients with chronic medical conditions who needed to adhere to a medication schedule.HealthBeacon‚Äôs IPO raised ‚Ç¨25m  with the company reporting a market capitalisation of ‚Ç¨98.4m on the day of its public listing. This figure now stands at around ‚Ç¨32m on Euronext Dublin  while shares have slid around 58pc in the past year.In the past month  however  the share price has jumped 111pc. Mr Joyce attributes this to a surge in activity in the US  with a few key areas giving ‚Äúall that optimism that we‚Äôve got the right product fit.‚ÄùThe first area is the specialty pharmacy industry.‚ÄúWe‚Äôve done a number of deals with specialty pharmacy organisations in the US ‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúOrganisations like Accredo  where they integrated the technology into their fundamental offering.‚ÄúThat means if you‚Äôre on a high-value injectable medication and you‚Äôre working with certain large pharmacy systems  you‚Äôre going to be offered the HealthBeacon device as part of going on that medication.‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a really exciting thing that we have been working on for years. That‚Äôs taken us a long time to get it there.‚ÄùHealthBeacon‚Äôs offerings will also be reimbursed by insurers in the US  he explains.‚ÄúThere‚Äôs been a new category developed with Medicare [federal health insurance] which allows for remote therapeutic monitoring. Clinicians in certain therapeutic areas can now provide the HealthBeacon to their patients and they can bill back to the insurance companies for that.‚ÄùMr Joyce spends most of his time in the market  building up teams and engaging with customers in the relevant channels. He is eager to build new partnerships  while others have been extended.This includes its partnership with Hamilton Beach Brands Inc earlier this month. Hamilton Beach is an American company focused on designing  marketing and distributing branded electric household  commercial or specialty products.‚ÄúHamilton Beach is going to be working with us on our manufacturing and supply chain ‚Äù Mr Joyce says. ‚ÄúThey are going to be taking over the management of our inventory and the actual shipping of our product directly to the patient.‚ÄúAs part of that  it frees up a lot of working capital. People are looking at this saying ‚Äòhey  from a working capital perspective  when do we get profitable? When do we start generating cash?‚Äô‚ÄùHe believes the Hamilton Beach deal extension will help answer some of those questions.‚Äú[The deal] reduces our cash burn as we invest and roll out in the States.‚ÄùThe scale of Hamilton Beach‚Äôs operations also reduces the costs of goods for the medtech firm. He describes the move as ‚Äúquite transformative financially.‚Äù‚Äú[Investors] were excited about us leaning into our supply chain and trying to really cleverly manage the cost of producing devices and getting it distributed to customers ‚Äù he adds.This was noted by Goodbody analyst Adam Barker following the announcement.‚ÄúThe expanded partnership will significantly improve HealthBeacon‚Äôs cashflows ‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúIn addition  it will also allow the company to leverage Hamilton Beach‚Äôs supply chain  distribution  and procurement capabilities to produce and distribute its health devices across the US more efficiently as it scales significantly in the region over the coming quarters.‚ÄùMore US partnerships are coming down the line with speciality pharmacy organisations  pharma companies  as well as clinical practices  Mr Joyce says.HealthBeacon has over 20 employees in the US market  with offices in Boston and Orlando.

(TSXV:TRU) (OTCQB:TRUIF) (""TRU"" or the ""Company"") is pleased to announce that","TORONTO  ON / ACCESSWIRE / July 4  2023 / TRU Precious Metals Corp. (TSXV:TRU) (OTCQB:TRUIF) (""TRU"" or the ""Company"") is pleased to announce that it has entered into a binding subscription agreement (the ""Agreement"") with Ormonde Mining Plc (""Ormonde"") (LON:ORM)  with respect to a non-brokered private placement of the Company to be carried out by a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ormonde for gross proceeds of CAD$3 000 000 (the ""Offering""). Pursuant to the Offering  the Company will issue a total of 60 000 000 units (""Units"") at a price of CAD$0.05 per Unit  with each Unit being comprised of one common share of the Company (each  a ""Common Share"") and 0.5 of one Common Share purchase warrant (each whole warrant  a ""Warrant""). Each Warrant would be exercisable to acquire one Common Share at a price of CAD$0.075 for a period of 36 months following the closing date of the Offering.Completion of the Offering is subject to Ormonde obtaining shareholder approval and delisting from both the LSE Alternative Investment Market (""AIM"") and Euronext Growth  and subsequently to Ormonde completing such delisting. Completion of the Offering is also subject to the Company obtaining shareholder and TSX Venture Exchange approval  as discussed below.Joel Freudman  Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer of TRU  commented: ""On behalf of TRU management and our board of directors  we're very excited to work with Ormonde towards them becoming a significant stakeholder of the Company. Their intended investment in TRU  which would mark Ormonde's first foray into mineral exploration in North America  validates that TRU is significantly undervalued at current share price levels  and cements us on the right path to value-creation ahead. Both parties are extremely committed to successfully completing the Offering. We're confident Ormonde will become an increasingly important partner of TRU  as we draw on their extensive technical expertise  successful transactional experience in the resource sector  and general capital markets savvy as we continue our efforts to develop our Golden Rose Project in central Newfoundland.""Ormonde is a natural resources company listed on AIM and on the Euronext Growth market in Dublin. Headquartered in Ireland  Ormonde is focused on evaluating and executing new opportunities in the mineral exploration sector  through which they can leverage their existing balance sheet to create shareholder value. Ormonde is run by a seasoned team with a wide range of experience in natural resources including base and precious metals  investment banking and advisory services  and senior advisory roles. Ormonde has a proven track record in the successful acquisition and sale of natural resource assets  including its most recent transaction  the sale of the La Zarza gold  copper and zinc deposit property located in the Iberian Pyrite Belt in Spain.Upon completion of the Offering  and assuming no other share issuances by TRU  Ormonde would own approximately 36.19% of the Company's issued and outstanding Common Shares  or 45.97% of the Common Shares on a partially-diluted basis if Ormonde were to exercise all the Warrants that would be issued to it under the Offering.In connection with the Offering  and provided Ormonde would hold greater than 33% of the issued and outstanding Common Shares  (a) Ormonde would have the right to appoint three out of five nominees to the board of directors of the Company (the ""Board"") (subject to TSX Venture Exchange approval)  and (b) management of the Company would nominate the Ormonde nominees for election as directors of the Company at each annual meeting of shareholders held following closing and the Company would be required to use its best efforts (subject to fiduciary obligations) to ensure that that nominees are elected as directors.As a further demonstration of the parties' commitment to completing the Offering  the Company has appointed Brian Timmons  the Chairman of the board of directors of Ormonde  to the Board. Mr. Timmons has over 30 years of experience in senior positions within financial institutions and a range of companies across the corporate sector including companies operating in the alternative energy  natural resource  healthcare technology  bioscience and software IT sectors. He is a Fellow of the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants.To accommodate Mr. Timmons joining the Board  Barry Greene has resigned as a director of TRU. Mr. Freudman added: ""On behalf of the entire TRU team  we sincerely thank Barry for his longstanding service to the Company since its developmental days in late 2020  first as our inaugural Vice-President of Property Development  and more recently as Chair of the Technical Committee of the Board. We wish Barry much success in his future endeavours. We also take this opportunity to welcome Brian Timmons to our Board  and look forward to his governance and transactional advice.""The proceeds from the Offering will be used for the development of the Company's Golden Rose Project  as well as for general corporate and working capital purposes. No finder's fees or commissions will be paid in connection with the Offering.Given that  following the completion of the Offering  Ormonde will have a right to appoint a majority of the directors to the board of directors of the Company  and will hold greater than 20% of the outstanding Common Shares  the Offering will require shareholder approval pursuant to the applicable policies of the TSX Venture Exchange  as Ormonde will be deemed to be a new ""Control Person"" of the Company. The Company has called an annual and special meeting of shareholders of the Company  which will be held on July 31  2023  for (among other things) the purpose of obtaining the requisite shareholder approvals for the Offering.The directors of the Corporation have unanimously approved the terms of the Offering.The securities to be issued pursuant to the Offering have not been  and will not be  registered under the United States Securities Act of 1933  as amended (the ""U.S. Securities Act"") or any U.S. state securities laws and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an available exemption from the registration requirement of the U.S. Securities Act and applicable U.S. state securities laws.
