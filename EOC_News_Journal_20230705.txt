The company  which is committed to driving the transition to zero emissions in public transport  is hereby laying the foundations for its future ESG strategy.Based on the belief that electric is the future  Ebusco has spent the past decade proving that zero emission is a choice. With more than 420 Ebusco buses on the road by 2022  the deployment of electric buses in that year alone saved 48 million grams of nitrogen and a further 28 million kilograms of CO 2 . Although sustainability is deeply rooted in Ebusco's DNA  the publication of the Sustainability Report is the first formal step towards a strategic ESG framework.Peter Bijvelds  CEO at Ebusco  explains: ""Over the past decade  the market perception of electric transport has changed dramatically. Initially  the focus was mainly on cost and range limitations  meanwhile  governments are actively steering towards zero emission driving and the stage is set for a major shift. With the Ebusco 2.2 and Ebusco 3.0  we have proven that zero emission driving is a choice  now it is up to us as a company to extend this focus on sustainability to other facets within our organisation. The publication of our very first Sustainability Report is a next step in that direction.""Key points covered in the 2022 report include:Towards a sustainable ESG policy : as a pioneer in zero emission transport  Ebusco is also striving to reduce its own environmental footprint. This year  among other things  the company provided insight into its Scope 1 and 2 emissions  as well as a comprehensive materiality analysis. This analysis serves as the basis for the further development of its ESG policy  which will focus on health & safety  sustainable innovation and supplier due diligence.: as a pioneer in zero emission transport  Ebusco is also striving to reduce its own environmental footprint.

This analysis serves as the basis for the further development of its ESG policy  which will focus on health & safety  sustainable innovation and supplier due diligence. Smart use of materials for sustainable impact : by opting for a composite body  the Ebusco 3.0 not only realises a huge weight saving and emission reduction  but also offers an expected lifetime of up to 25 years. Moreover  Ebusco is committed to promoting composite recycling in the long term. For example by collaborating with universities and colleges to study the reuse of composite beams' waste fibres in the production process.: by opting for a composite body  the Ebusco 3.0 not only realises a huge weight saving and emission reduction  but also offers an expected lifetime of up to 25 years.

Working together for personal growth: in 2022  Ebusco's workforce grew from 309 to 607 FTEs. To structurally support the personal growth of employees  the Ebusco Academy was launched. Here employees can find a mix of more than 400 e-learnings and live trainings.The Sustainability Report is compiled in line with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and serves as a basis to improve Ebusco's sustainability performance. Currently  Ebusco is already included in ESG-rankings by Sustainalytics and MSCI.Matthijs Versteeg  Sustainability Manager at Ebusco  explains: ""At Ebusco  we wish to make a sustainable impact in the transition to electric public transport. We are committed to doing this in a transparent manner. We do so in a practical way by developing innovative zero emission buses  but also by clearly reporting on our ESG initiatives- and progress.

passenger volumes amidst strikes,The low-cost airline revealed that 17.4 million people flew on its planes last month  a 9 per cent increase on the 15.9 million who travelled with the group in June 2022.,Ryanair achieved record passenger numbers in June despite industrial action in France causing multiple flight cancellations.The low-cost airline revealed that 17.4 million people flew on its planes last month  a 9 per cent increase on the 15.9 million who travelled with it in June 2022 and around 400 000 higher than in May.Customer levels would have been even greater had French air traffic controllers not staged a series of walkouts over President Emmanuel Macron's controversial pension reforms  which included raising the retirement age by two years.Popular: Ryanair revealed that 17.4m people flew on its planes last month  a 9% increase on the 15.9m who travelled with the group in June 2022Ryanair said it 'regrettably' axed more than 900 flights in June  impacting about 160 000 passengers  but still had 96 250 flights in total.The Dublin-based firm scrapped about 400 trips on 6 June  the same day French unions began a national day of action  and around 130 more on 29 June when the country's airport workers were staging a 34-hour strike.Air traffic controllers in France have organised 60 strike days this year alone  causing massive disruption to hundreds of thousands of travellers.Under French law  domestic flights must keep running during strike periods  but international flights are prohibited from flying over the country.Nonetheless  air carriers have seen their passenger volumes continue to recover strongly thanks to loosening Covid-related international travel restrictions.Russ Mould  investment director at AJ Bell  said: 'The frequent recurrence of these issues means a lot of travellers have become used to the problems that come with flying  but they still go ahead and book flights.'Airlines will be thankful for that  although they would prefer a much smoother experience for the customer.'On a 12-month rolling basis to June 2023  173.4million customers have flown with Ryanair  a 29 per cent jump on the 134.5million recorded the previous year.Though further industrial action is expected across Europe this summer and countries contend with cost-of-living pressures  many airlines and airports are anticipating their busiest summer ever.In May  Ryanair declared it would be operating its 'largest ever schedule' this season  covering nearly 2 500 routes and more than 3 000 daily flights.Soon afterwards  Hungarian rival Wizz Air said it was 'ready to deliver record summer traffic ' having been badly affected last year by staff shortages  industrial action and airport capacity limits.The Budapest-headquartered company also revealed its traffic figures for June on Tuesday  telling investors that 5.3 million people travelled with the firm  almost a million more than in the same month last year.In June  the group announced another 10 new routes on its Albanian network  with flights from Tirana to Birmingham  Edinburgh and Liverpool due to commence during the winter season.Wizz Air shares were 1.5 per cent higher at £28.36 this morning  while Ryanair shares on the Euronext Dublin were 0.4 per cent lower at €17.25.,neutral,0.01,0.87,0.11,mixed,0.13,0.12,0.75,True,English,"['monthly passenger volumes', 'Ryanair',

Mr. Marco Piana  thanking the Chairperson  informs the attendees that throughout the financial year that ended on 31 December 2022  the Board focussed on finding a suitable Target for the Company. Since the IPO  the Board has assessed a wide variety of potential suitable Targets and has engaged in discussions with several of them. Certain potential Targets were  following investigation  considered not to meet the Target business criteria or would otherwise not result in a Business Combination at an acceptable valuation  while others elected to pursue other strategic avenues such as a private sale or were reluctant to pursue a Business Combination due to macroeconomic events. Mr. Marco Piana reminds that on 9 June 2023 the Company announced its entry into a Binding Term Sheet with Supermoney  with the aim to agree a business combination. Supermoney is a primary Italian online broker offering price comparison and technological services  mainly in the energy  gas and telecommunications sector.

Moreover  the Company is working hard to move the transaction forward with a view to enter into a business combination agreement with Supermoney before 21 October 2023  which is the new business combination deadline if the shareholders approve the extension on 21 July 2023. The potential Business Combination with Supermoney will in any event be further discussed at that extraordinary general meeting.

As part of the transaction  Aegon received EUR 2.2 billion cash proceeds and a 29.99% stake in a.s.r.“The completion of this transaction marks a major milestone in Aegon’s history and in our long-term ambition to create leaders in investments  protection  and retirement solutions”  said Lard Friese  CEO of Aegon. “The combination creates the number two insurance company in the Netherlands  with significant scale across different segments  benefiting all our stakeholders. I want to take this opportunity to thank all of the Aegon employees who will now move to a.s.r. for their significant contribution over the years. I wish them all every success for the future.”The relationship agreement has been slightly amended so that two matters now require unanimous approval of a.s.r.’s Supervisory Board. These relate to CEO succession in the case the current CEO of a.s.r. steps down before the end of his current term  and material decisions on capital management which would lead to a change in the risk profile. The rest of the relationship agreement  including affirmative votes on significant changes to a.s.r.’s dividend policy  certain dilutive transactions  and certain M&A transactions  remains unchanged.The completion of the transaction will result in a significant increase of Aegon’s Cash Capital at the Holding. As previously indicated  Aegon expects to initiate a EUR 1.5 billion share buyback program over a 12-month period shortly.Contacts Media relations Investor relations Carolien van der Giessen Jan Willem Weidema +31(0) 6 11953367 +31(0) 70 344 8028 carolien.vandergiessen@aegon.com janwillem.weidema@aegon.comAbout AegonAegon is an international financial services holding company.

Neil England  Chairman of Augmentum Fintech plc commented:“Despite challenging markets  the bulk of your Company’s investments have performed well and I am pleased to report that they made a positive contribution to the Company’s NAV per share after performance fee  which increased by 3.7p to 158.9p.Your Company has now successfully exited five portfolio investments  all of which have been at or above the last reported holding value. This should provide investors with comfort that our valuations process is rigorous and corroborates the discipline our Portfolio Manager has exercised when evaluating new investments and their reporting on the portfolio.We maintained our investment discipline over the last year and  with our strong cash reserves (£38.5 million at 31 March 2023  £50.0 million at 30 June 2023) we are well placed both to take advantage of new opportunities and to reinforce our appeal as a supportive investor.Your Board believes that the Company will see a closing of the discount at which its shares trade over time and  with the underlying growth of the portfolio generally being very strong  expects that patient shareholders will be well rewarded.” Tim Levene  CEO of Augmentum Fintech Management Limited commented:“Our 10 highest value holdings have seen revenue growth at an impressive average of 117% year-on-year and raised over US$300 million in capital during a challenging macroeconomic and fundraising environment. Despite an increased focus from venture investors on companies displaying a clear path to profitability and reducing cash burn  the growth in our portfolio through the cycle reflects the quality of many of our companies and the unabated advance of digital transformation in the financial services sector.We are seeing a material increase in the number of compelling investment opportunities at more pragmatic valuations and expect that to continue into 2024. Our fintech specialism and strong balance sheet position leave us well positioned to take advantage of more favourable investment conditions.” Notes 1 The Board considers the NAV per share after any performance fees payable to be the most accurate way to reflect the underlying value of each share.2 Annualised IRR on invested capital and realisations since inception using valuations at the last reporting date.

Please see the Glossary and Alternative Performance Measures on page 79. To read about our KPIs see page 22. I am pleased to present our fifth annual report since the launch of the Company in March 2018. This report covers the year ended 31 March 2023. Investment Policy Your Company invests in early stage European fintech businesses which have technologies that are disruptive to the traditional financial services sectors and/or support the trend to digitalisation and market efficiency. A typical investment will offer the prospect of high growth and the potential to scale. Our objective is to provide long-term capital growth to shareholders by offering them exposure to a diversified portfolio of private fintech companies during what is often their period of rapid value accretion. Performance Shareholders will be fully aware of the significant market volatility throughout the year under review. The war in Europe  inflation  rising interest rates after a prolonged period of close to free money  highly priced US technology stocks falling in value and the contagion from that have all been factors. Fast growing companies that need cash to fuel that growth have generally been out of favour. Despite difficult markets  the bulk of your Company’s investments performed very well and I am pleased to report that they made a positive contribution to the Company’s net asset value (“NAV”) per share after performance fee1*  which increased by 3.7p to 158.9p. The operational performance of portfolio companies was generally strong  with some stand out results  and the majority have cash runways that will fund their businesses through to profitability. In normal markets these performances would be expected to produce a strong NAV improvement  but valuations were negatively affected in some cases by declines in public market comparators. The modest increase in the Company’s NAV per share after performance fee is nonetheless encouraging in a market where many others have suffered significant valuation write downs and illustrates that the diversified portfolio of investments we hold is important when individual sectors become stressed. It is disappointing that the NAV growth we have enjoyed over the past five years is not reflected in our share price. For a long period  your Company enjoyed the highest premiums of any investment company listed in London. This reflected the opportunity for a public market investor to gain exposure to fast growing private fintech companies  which was otherwise not available to them. That opportunity in a vast addressable market is undimmed  yet the price at which the Company’s shares traded fell again across the period. The share price touched a low of 86.8p during the year and ended the period at 97.0p  representing a 27.1% reduction from the price at 31 March 2022. The share price falling to a discount to NAV from the beginning of 2022 correlates with market sentiment turning against growth stocks and private equity generally  but is frustrating because it does not reflect the underlying performance or the potential of the Company’s portfolio and seemingly gives little credit to the rigour of our valuations process. The proceeds from our recent portfolio disposals provide an illustration of the latter. 1* Note: The Board considers the NAV per share after any performance fees provision to be the most accurate way to reflect the underlying value of each share  whereas accounting standards require the Group’s consolidated NAV per share to be presented before such fees are deducted as a consequence of our Portfolio Manager being within our Group structure and the fees therefore being eliminated on consolidation. Portfolio The most significant portfolio transaction in the year was the receipt of proceeds of £42.8 million early in the period from the completion of abrdn’s acquisition of interactive investor (“ii”)  which was the Company’s largest investment. The transaction delivered an 84.8% IRR and 11.1 times multiple on invested capital . Post year end  another significant disposal was made when the Company sold its holding in Cushon to NatWest Group. The £22.8 million proceeds of this sale  which is fully reflected in the year end valuation  represents a multiple of 2.1 times invested capital and an IRR of 61.6%. Your Company has now made five successful portfolio investment exits  all of which have been at or above the last reported holding value. This should provide investors with comfort that our valuations process is rigorous and corroborates the discipline our Portfolio Manager has exercised when evaluating new investments and their reporting on the portfolio. Deployments in the year included new investments of £4.0 million in Israeli payments monitoring and acceptance fintech Kipp and €3 million (£2.6 million) in Berlin-based cyber insurance platform Baobab. A further £13.1 million of follow-on funding was made to support existing portfolio companies. These included Zopa (£4.0 million)  Anyfin (£2.7 million)  Previse (£2.0 million)  Habito (£1.3 million)  Wayhome (£0.9 million) and Cushon (£0.8 million). Since the year end we have also participated in the Series B fundraising of Volt  investing a further £5.3 million. There is a full review of the portfolio and investment transactions in the year in the Portfolio Manager’s Review beginning on page 15. Portfolio Management Our investment team continues to evaluate a wide range of opportunities  reviewing financial and commercial metrics in order to identify those most likely to be successful. We are active investors and work closely with the companies we invest in  often taking either a board or an observer seat  and working closely with management to guide strategy consistent with long-term value creation. Our portfolio is already diversified across different fintech sectors and maturity stages and we are keen to expand it further. We are committed to responsible investing. We integrate Environmental  Social and Governance (“ESG”) factors in our investment analysis  due diligence and operating practices as we believe that these are key in mitigating risk and creating sustainable  profitable investments. Valuations Your Board considers its governance role in the valuations process to be of utmost importance. Shareholders in investment companies with a private portfolio are understandably sceptical of valuations when they don’t see them change as much or as rapidly as they do in many public companies. The results we are reporting reflect an in-depth and challenging process  supported by our advisers. We have always maintained a consistent  rigorous and disciplined approach to valuations. We did not write up the value of your Company’s investments to the levels attributed to many fintech companies when the market was very bullish. It follows that the level of any adjustments we have needed to make this year is relatively small in comparison to some other funds  quite apart from strong growth offsetting reductions in comparative multiples. We have carefully reviewed both the status and the forecasts of all of the portfolio companies  used appropriate and consistent methodologies to determine the value of each investment and to sense check our conclusions. We also benefit from some of our investments occupying a senior position in the capital structures of the investee companies  protecting against downside risk. Discount Control The Company’s shares traded at a discount to NAV for the whole of the year under review and up to the date of this report  notwithstanding the underlying value and strong prospects of the portfolio. The Board has instigated a programme of highly accretive buybacks  seeking to convey to the market our confidence in the value of the portfolio. Directors and others associated with the Company have also purchased shares. We continued with these accretive buybacks through the year under review  with all the shares purchased by the Company being held in treasury to potentially reissue when the share price returns to a premium. 5 806 934 shares were bought back into treasury during the year to 31 March 2023  at an average price of 102.9p per share  representing an average discount to the prevailing NAV per share after performance fee of 34.1% and adding 1.8p/1.1% to the NAV per share. A further 3 918 878 shares have been bought back since March  up to 30 June 2023  at an average price of 98.6p per share. We will seek to renew shareholders’ authorities to issue and buy back shares at the forthcoming AGM. Potential Returns of Capital As set out on page 24 of this annual report  the Company may  at the discretion of the Directors  return a proportion of the gains realised during a year from the disposal of investments. Factors influencing this will include the quantum of any sale proceeds  the opportunities offered by the investment pipeline and the working capital requirements of the Company. I explained in last year’s report that following the sale of ii we considered whether some of the proceeds should be returned to shareholders or retained to facilitate future investment opportunities. The Company has not reached the scale to which we aspire and the current share price discount and unfavourable market conditions are frustrating our ability to raise new capital for investment. After consultation with major shareholders last year we decided to retain a good proportion of these proceeds for reinvestment to support our capital growth objective and utilise the balance to support an accretive share buyback programme when the discount is high. The Board reconsidered this decision during the year and decided to commit further to the buyback programme whilst retaining funds to take advantage of new investment opportunities and to provide follow-on support to existing investments  which are often available on favourable terms. Dividend No dividend has been declared or recommended for the year. Your Company is focused on providing capital growth and has a policy to only pay dividends to the extent that it is necessary to maintain the Company’s investment trust status. Registrar Shareholders should note that  as part of our regular review of service providers  we have decided to change the Company's registrar from Link Group to Computershare Investor Services PLC. This change will take place on 18 December 2023. AGM Our AGM will be held on Tuesday 19 September 2023 at 11.00 a.m. at the Augmentum Fintech Management Limited office at 4 Chiswell Street EC1Y 4UP. The Notice of AGM will be published shortly after the publication of this annual report. Your Board strongly encourages shareholders to register their votes in advance by voting online using the Registrar’s portal  www.signalshares.com or  if they are not held directly  by instructing the nominee company through which the shares are held. Registering votes online will not preclude shareholders from attending the meeting. One of our resolutions will be to seek shareholder authority to issue shares by reference to the NAV per share after performance fee as we believe this to be the best reflection of value  as explained in the note at the foot of page 2. Further details of this and other resolutions will be found in the Notice of AGM  which will be published and sent to shareholders shortly after the publication of this annual report. Both documents will also be available to view on or download from the Company’s website at www.augmentum.vc. Your Directors consider all the resolutions that will be listed in the Notice of AGM to be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders and recommend voting in favour of them  as your Directors intend to do in respect of their own holdings. Outlook Inflation remains high  along with interest rates as the authorities strive to bring it back to target levels. Early stage growth portfolios may currently be out of favour  but Augmentum has proved its model  well-illustrated by our realisations all producing returns in excess of their previous carrying value. Our largest 5 investments  in particular  are performing well. The underlying need to digitalise and transform last century’s infrastructure remains  as nearly all financial services sectors continue to be dominated by traditional operators whose operations cannot ignore the rapid development of less costly  and in many cases more secure  business models. We maintained our investment discipline over the last year and  with our strong cash reserves (£38.5 million at 31 March 2023  £50.0 million at 30 June 2023)  we are well placed both to take advantage of new opportunities and to reinforce our appeal as a supportive investor. Your Board believes that the Company will see a closing of the discount at which its shares trade over time and  with the underlying growth of the portfolio generally being very strong  expects that patient shareholders will be well rewarded. Neil England Chairman 3 July 2023 . PORTFOLIO MANAGER’S REVIEW Overview I write to you after another 12 months of uncertainty following the economy-wide adjustment to a higher interest rate environment. Having flown the furthest under the market conditions of 2020-21  it is the listed technology sector that has faced the most significant correction to valuations in response to rising rates. Despite a bounce  in particular by the FAANG stocks  listed tech stocks continue to trade well below their 10-year average. The increased cost of capital has reordered priorities from growth to profitability  and returned focus to core business lines and expense control. The market has become more discerning of companies with strong fundamentals and those without  and the significant rotation of capital into low-risk assets means that valuation multiples for listed growth stocks  and fintechs within this  remain compressed. The stability of Augmentum’s NAV per share over the past twelve months therefore belies the real story of continued progress and maturity in the portfolio. Our 10 highest value holdings have seen revenue growth at an impressive average of 117% year-on-year and raised over US$300 million in equity capital despite a more challenging macroeconomic and fundraising environment. Yet this strong performance has largely been offset by multiple compression in comparable public markets. The growth in our portfolio through the cycle reflects the quality of many of our companies and the unabated advance of digital transformation in the financial services sector. The digital-asset sector suffered from a series of high-profile collapses and subsequent contagion during 2022. These events highlighted critical gaps in regulation and naivety in the nascent market structure. The response from regulators has been an acceleration in policy development and enforcement action. Europe has positioned itself as a leader through the Markets in Crypto Asset (MiCA) regulation that will apply from 2024 and brings welcome clarity to digital asset firms who are committed to building compliant  legitimate businesses. This clarity is lacking in the US market where enforcement action against high profile firms has increased and we expect to see the biggest players in the market move their domicile from the US to Europe  the Middle East or Asia unless this changes in the coming year. Recent advances in generative AI have instigated a wave of interest in the technology and its future application in financial services. We believe that generative AI will significantly increase the efficiency of generalisable content-related tasks across industries such as coding and marketing. For more complex financial services use cases  where accuracy and compliance are imperative  it is still early from both a technology and regulatory perspective. For now we remain in discovery mode but it is our job as thesis driven investors to be ahead of the curve on the investment opportunities that these innovative technologies create. From our perspective  it has taken the full year of 2022 and the first half of 2023 for the valuation expectations of founding teams and investors to reconverge. Our level of new investment activity  lower than previous periods  has reflected this. We expect the second half of 2023 to be more active than the first half as a result of a larger number of better quality fintechs coming to the market for more capital. Following the reset to private market valuations  this will be an exciting time to deploy early-stage capital. We are a specialist investor in high potential businesses that are disrupting one of the largest and most profitable sectors of the economy. Our fintech specialism and strong balance sheet position leave us well positioned to take advantage of normalised investment conditions. We remain committed to a diversified  private-market strategy to deliver long-term returns. Investment Activity Investment activity during the year totalled £19.9 million. This is lower than the Company’s annual average since IPO of £36.4 million but has been appropriate during the period of adjustment that the investment environment has moved through. New investment activity followed from high conviction thesis development in the areas of digital payments and cyber-insurance  and has been the product of our pan-European strategy  with both new investments located outside the UK. In my half-year report I introduced our investment in Kipp  an Israeli innovator in online payment acceptance. In the period since  we have welcomed German cyber-insurance provider Baobab to the portfolio. Both companies characterise our early-stage strategy with teams who bring deep domain-expertise  technology that drives differentiation and a competitive advantage  and large  growing market opportunities. These new investments  totalling £6.6 million  were secured off-market  outside of competitive investment processes  on the basis of strong relationships with the founding teams and their confidence in Augmentum as the right investment partner. Our thesis driven approach is particularly important when identifying early-stage opportunities ahead of our competition. We continue to take advantage of our ability to support the strong performers in the portfolio with further capital and completed eight follow-on investments totalling £13.1 million. With proceeds  now received  from our fifth portfolio exit  of Cushon to NatWest Group  the Company ends the period with a strong balance sheet. New Investments Falling within our thesis of optimisation in the digital payment technology stack  Augmentum invested £4.0 million in Kipp in May 2022. The acceptance of card payments in ecommerce transactions remains a critical issue for merchants and issuing banks  particularly in cross-border payment contexts. Kipp’s platform enables these parties to engage in real time information sharing to reduce rates of false-positive payment decline. Kipp is delivering significant additional conversion of transactions that would otherwise be lost across their initial cohort of international merchant customers. Cyber-attacks represent a growing risk to businesses of all sizes and the insurance market is undergoing a rapid expansion  with the value of premiums expected to scale to US$22 billion by 20251. An integrated  data-driven approach is critical to understanding risk at an individual business level and to price policies accordingly. Incumbent insurers are not effectively set up to carry out data collection and assessment at scale and herein lies the opportunity for fintechs. In January 2023 Augmentum invested £2.6 million in Baobab  who provide coverage to SMEs in Germany and Austria with capacity provided by Zurich Insurance. 1 Munich Re  2022 Portfolio As I wrote to you in my half-year report  our team’s experience as operators and active engagement through board positions has played a significant role in helping our companies to navigate the change in market conditions. Throughout 2022 and 2023 cost control and sustainable growth have been core areas of focus. Follow-on funding is also another avenue of portfolio support and we completed eight investments into the existing portfolio during the period. The funding rounds we participated in either supported companies with runway to breakeven or provided additional time ahead of their next funding round. For the companies that will fundraise in the year ahead we expect conditions to be more favourable  assuming they have used this period of market resettlement to realign strategy and costs to current conditions. Follow-on Investments and Other Top 10 Early in the period  in July 2022  we invested £2.0 million in Previse’s £14.5 million Series B funding round led by Tencent. Previse provides embedded lending and payment technology within B2B supply chains. They are the technology provider behind Mastercard’s virtual card solution for businesses available in more than 100 markets. During 2023 Previse has taken steps to rationalise its product suite and there has been compression in the valuation multiples of listed peers. The fair value of our holding has accordingly reduced £1.9 million in the year. In November 2022 we invested a further £2.7 million into Anyfin  the leading consumer credit refinancing player in the Nordics and Germany. Augmentum’s investment formed part of a €30 million Series C round which will take the company to breakeven in 2024. The round was led by existing investors along with a strategic investment from the venture investment arm of Citibank. Anyfin has seen strong counter cyclical demand for its product but has maintained discipline in underwriting approach given market conditions. The revaluation of our holding  down £3.3 million  reflects compression in market multiples in the listed lending vertical. In January 2023 we invested £4 million into Zopa which  along with a £0.5 million uplift  takes the total value of our holding to £30.1 million. Zopa continues to deliver exceptional performance as a fully licensed bank with increasingly diversified lending activity and total deposits approaching £4 billion. The company is performing ahead of budget and on track to achieve full year profitability in 2023. The ability to maintain low cost of capital through deposits and to draw from a 17 year lending track record translate into a distinct competitive advantage for Zopa that is particularly powerful in the current economic environment. We made four small investments of under £1.5 million each as part of funding rounds for Farewill  Wayhome and Habito  and supported Cushon through their acquisition process with a short-term investment that has since been returned as part of exit proceeds. At the beginning of the calendar year we received a dividend of £0.6 million from BullionVault following strong trading performance and profitability  driving a £2.1 million valuation increase. The company is a leading precious metals investment marketplace and continues to trade well during periods of volatility in mainstream markets. Grover (valuation up £0.7 million in the year) has enjoyed a successful year in its transition towards long-termprofitable growth. Total subscription value as at the reporting date was rapidly nearing €250 million representing 50% year-on-year growth in the top line despite a near 50% year-on-year reduction in quarterly marketing spend. Average cost of customer acquisition has fallen by 25% since Q1 2022 with net revenue retention above 100%. Grover’s nascent B2B offering now represents fully 15% of overall subscription revenue  with the international business growing at nearly 20% month-on-month and growth outstripping the retail business in the domestic market. Our second largest holding  Tide  is well established as the leading digital business banking platform for SMEs in the UK with half a million customers and market share of 9%. In the last 12 months considerable progress has been made on revenue diversification and geographical expansion with the official launch of Tide India taking place in December 2022. Year-on-year revenue growth of 74% has more than offset valuation multiple compression to deliver an 18% (£7.5 million) increase in our holding value. Tide completed their first acquisition; absorbing SME credit marketplace Funding Options into the business to broaden credit access for Tide customers. Tide is well positioned to consider additional acquisitions in the current market environment in order to further broaden product capabilities or geographical presence. Fifty countries and counting now have an Open Banking initiative in place and account-to-account (“A2A”) payments - where funds are moved in real-time between transacting parties - is the fastest growing use case. Volt are established as a leading provider of account-to-account payment connectivity. Through a unique network aggregation model  Volt’s coverage is expanding in line with the global roll-out of Open Banking initiatives  delivering the consistency and quality of service demanded by the highest-volume ecommerce merchants and facilitators in twenty-five countries and counting. In June 2023 Worldpay  the world’s largest merchant acquirer  and ecommerce software giant Shopify selected Volt as their global A2A partner. The increase in the value of our holding  of £8.6 million  has been supported by exceptional revenue growth and post-period end Volt announced a Series B fundraising of US$60 million led by US based IVP with Augmentum investing a further £5.3 million. Monese continues to advance their B2B strategy while maintainingmoderated growth in their pan-European retail banking platform. In May 2023 the company announced their coreless banking platform under the new brand XYB. The last twelve months have been a period of adjustment for the company to the new strategy and market environment and we take confidence from the quality of customers that XYB has been able to secure  supported by a healthy pipeline. In September 2022  the strategic venture arm of HSBC joined Investec Bank with a £30 million investment driven by their interest in XYBs technology and delivery capability. Despite this positive newsflow Monese's valuation fell £1.5 million. Onfido’s product is primarily used in customer on-boarding withvolumes therefore influenced by product demand. With a mix of financial services verticals represented in the customer base  reduced on-boarding in areas such as digital assets has been offset by continued expansion in verticals such as digital banking. Onfido are another of our portfolio who have taken advantage of value-pricing in the market to extend product capabilities through acquisition  announcing the acquisition of Airside Mobile in May 2023 to accelerate product development in the area of re-usable digital ID. The reduction in the fair value of our holding  of £5.1 million  is reflective of compression in the valuation multiples of listed peers despite a positive year-on-year growth rate and being on a fully funded pathway to profitability. Our investments in the digital asset sector make up 5.2% (2022: 8.6%) of the portfolio. Our thesis has focused on backing companies that have a long-term view and are intent on building an institutional grade proposition underpinned by robust regulatory frameworks. Despite our continued conviction in this approach  our investments so far have disappointed  and we are reporting significant reductions in the fair value of our positions in Gemini  Tesseract and Parafi  of £2.2 million  £6.3 million and £2.0 million  respectively. In the last 12 months digital asset markets have been undermined by actors operating without regard for regulation and the general reduction in the demand for risk assets in the new macroeconomic environment. The growth trajectories of our companies have been impacted by these events and each has taken steps to adjust costs and strategy to current trading conditions. Exits The Company saw its second significant exit during the year  with interactive investor  the direct-to-consumer fixed fee investment platform  acquired by abrdn in May 2022 for £1.49 billion. This resulted in proceeds for the Company of £42.8 million  delivering an IRR of 84.8% and multiple on capital invested of 11.1 times. interactive investor was an early investment in the Augmentum portfolio  quite antithetical to most venture capital radars at the point of investment. Under strong leadership and disciplined focus the company grew rapidly to over £55 billion of customer assets under administration  becoming the second largest self-directed investment platform in the UK. The acquisition of workplace pensions provider Cushon by NatWest Group was announced during the period in February 2023 and  following regulatory approval  completed post-period end on 1st June. Augmentum received proceeds of £22.8 million from the sale  giving an IRR of 61.6% and multiple on capital invested of 2.1 times. Realised value represents a c40% uplift on the holding value we reported in the Company’s half year results. This marks the fifth exit from the portfolio and is a further example of our measured approach to valuation; each exit to date has been realised above or on-par with the previously reported carrying value. Performance For the year to 31 March 2023 we are reporting gains on investments of £9.9 million (2022 £56.7 million). Since IPO this represents an IRR of 18.5% on the capital that we have deployed. We continue to take a consistent and disciplined approach to arrive at fair values for the Company’s portfolio positions. The valuation methodology (or methodologies) applied to each company is selected with consideration of individual stage and circumstance. Our growing track record of exits shows realisations above or on-par with the last reported holding value. In recent reports we have spoken more actively to shareholders about the downside protections that form an integral part of the structure of our typical investments. The most common protections across the portfolio are liquidation preferences and anti-dilution provisions with 21 out of 25 portfolio positions protected by at least one of these. These structures differentiate our shareholdings from ordinary shares held in public or private companies because they protect value in the eventuality that a company’s headline valuation is reduced. Through the market volatility of 2022 these structures provided additional support to the holding value of some of our positions  particularly those held in earlier stage companies. Our diversified portfolio approach also remains important. This extends across verticals  stages of maturity and geographies and reduces our overall exposure to market impact on any one of these. Outlook In the dislocation that follows from periods of economic turbulence  entrepreneurs are presented with new opportunities to establish ground-breaking businesses. This principle can also apply to venture capital firms that operate with a clear purpose and we have welcomed the general retreat of ‘tourist capital’ and the so-called ‘mega-rounds’ that played a distortionary role in private markets during the second half of 2020 and 2021. Quality deal flow is visibly improving as companies funded internally through the turbulence of 2022 are now returning to market. Amongst them are high potential prospects in line with our mandate which are bolstering the investment pipeline. Increasing levels of “dry powder” in the market maintain competition for quality companies but our thesis driven approach and unique proposition – fintech specialism  patient capital and operating experience – continue to cut through. Less compelling investment opportunities are also returning to market  and we anticipate a further shakeout and consolidation of companies to come. Several of our established portfolio companies have already found value-opportunities to add product and personnel capabilities through acquisition. As fast-growing market leaders in their respective fintech verticals they are well positioned to consider further opportunities in the period ahead. Investors should see this is another signal of maturity in the portfolio along with progression towards profitability and exit. The headroom for further disruption in financial services remains significant and recent policy dialogue provides us many reasons for optimism around the future of the technology sector in the UK and Europe. Strong cross-party support was in evidence at the recent London Tech Week (June 2023) where both the Prime Minister and Leader of the Opposition spoke in favour of further investment and progressive regulation in the UK in order to capture the economy-wide benefits of a generational opportunity in AI. Reforms such as the removal of the fee cap on defined contribution pension funds and a potential UK sovereign wealth fund will begin to address the historic under-investment from UK institutions in the venture capital asset class. In the interests of the UK building on its preeminent position in European fintech we hope and expect that those with the power to implement these measures proceed to do so in a full and timely fashion. As we navigate an evolving investment and technology landscape where change is not uniform across countries  it is ever more important to continue to develop our brand across Europe. We are well positioned to identify and win exceptional investment opportunities and build on our reputation as one of Europe’s leading fintech venture investors. Tim Levene CEO Augmentum Fintech Management Ltd 3 July 2023 . INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE AND POLICY Investment objective The Company’s investment objective is to generate capital growth over the long term through investment in a focused portfolio of fast growing and/or high potential private financial services technology (“fintech”) businesses based predominantly in the UK and wider Europe. Investment policy In order to achieve its investment objective  the Company invests in early or later stage investments in unquoted fintech businesses. The Company intends to realise value through exiting these investments over time. The Company seeks exposure to early stage businesses which are high growth  with scalable opportunities  and have disruptive technologies in the banking  insurance and wealth and asset management sectors as well as those that provide services to underpin the financial sector and other cross-industry propositions. Investments are expected to be mainly in the form of equity and equity-related instruments issued by portfolio companies  although investments may be made by way of convertible debt instruments. The Company intends to invest in unquoted companies and will ensure that the Company has suitable investor protection rights where appropriate. The Company may also invest in partnerships  limited liability partnerships and other legal forms of entity. The Company will not invest in publicly traded companies. However  portfolio companies may seek initial public offerings from time to time  in which case the Company may continue to hold such investments without restriction. The Company may acquire investments directly or by way of holdings in special purpose vehicles or intermediate holding entities (such as the Partnership*). The Management Team has historically taken a board or board observer position at investee companies and  where in the best interests of the Company  will do so in relation to future investee companies. The Company’s portfolio is expected to be diversified across a number of geographical areas predominantly within the UK and wider Europe  and the Company will at all times invest and manage the portfolio in a manner consistent with spreading investment risk. The Management Team will actively manage the portfolio to maximise returns  including helping to scale the team  refining and driving key performance indicators  stimulating growth  and positively influencing future financing and exits. Investment restrictions The Company will invest and manage its assets with the object of spreading risk through the following investment restrictions: • the value of no single investment (including related investments in group entities or related parties) will represent more than 15 per cent. of Net Asset Value; • the aggregate value of seed stage investments will represent no more than 1 per cent. of Net Asset Value; and • at least 80 per cent. of Net Asset Value will be invested in businesses which are headquartered in or have their main centre of business in the UK or wider Europe. In addition  the Company will itself not invest more than 15 per cent. of its gross assets in other investment companies or investment trusts which are listed on the Official List of the FCA. Each of the restrictions above will be calculated at the time of investment and disregard the effect of the receipt of rights  bonuses  benefits in the nature of capital or by reason of any other action affecting every holder of that investment. The Company will not be required to dispose of any investment or to rebalance the portfolio as a result of a change in the respective valuations of its assets. Hedging and derivatives Save for investments made using equity-related instruments as described above  the Company will not employ derivatives of any kind for investment purposes  but derivatives may be used for currency hedging purposes. Borrowing policy The Company may  from time to time  use borrowings to manage its working capital requirements but shall not borrow for investment purposes. Borrowings will not exceed 10 per cent. of the Company’s Net Asset Value  calculated at the time of borrowing. Cash management The Company may hold cash on deposit and may invest in cash equivalent investments  which may include short-term investments in money market type funds and tradeable debt securities. There is no restriction on the amount of cash or cash equivalent investments that the Company may hold or where it is held. The Board has agreed prudent cash management guidelines with the AIFM and the Portfolio Manager to ensure an appropriate risk/return profile is maintained. Cash and cash equivalents are held with approved counterparties. It is expected that the Company will hold between 5 and 15 per cent. of its Gross Assets in cash or cash equivalent investments  for the purpose of making follow-on investments in accordance with the Company’s investment policy and to manage the working capital requirements of the Company. Changes to the investment policy No material change will be made to the investment policy without the approval of Shareholders by ordinary resolution. Non-material changes to the investment policy may be approved by the Board. In the event of a breach of the investment policy set out above or the investment and gearing restrictions set out therein  the Management Team shall inform the AIFM and the Board upon becoming aware of the same and if the AIFM and/or the Board considers the breach to be material  notification will be made to a Regulatory Information Service. * Please refer to the Glossary on page 79. .

STRATEGIC REPORT Business Review The Strategic Report  set out on pages 18 to 30  provides a review of the Company’s business  the performance during the year and its strategy going forward. It also considers the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Company. It also includes information for shareholders to assess how the Directors have performed their duty to promote the success of the Company. In this respect  information on how the Directors have discharged their duties under Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 can be found on pages 26 and 27. The Strategic Report contains certain forward-looking statements. These statements are made by the Directors in good faith based on the information available to them up to the date of this report and such statements should be treated with caution due to the inherent uncertainties  including both economic and business risk factors  underlying any such forward-looking information. Strategy and Strategic Review Throughout the year under review  the Company continued to operate as an approved investment trust  following its investment objective and policy  seeking to generate capital growth over the long term through investment in a focused portfolio of fast growing and/or high potential private financial services technology (“fintech”) businesses based predominantly in the UK and wider Europe. The Company is an alternative investment fund (“AIF”) under the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Regulations (“UK AIFMD”) and has appointed Frostrow Capital LLP as its alternative investment fund manager (“AIFM”). During the year  the Board  Frostrow Capital LLP as AIFM  and the Portfolio Manager undertook all strategic and administrative activities. Principal Risks and Risk Management The Board considers that the risks detailed below are the principal risks currently facing the Company. These are the risks that could affect the ability of the Company to deliver its strategy. The Board is responsible for the ongoing identification  evaluation and management of the principal risks faced by the Company and has established a process for the regular review of these risks and their mitigation. This process accords with the UK Corporate Governance Code and the FRC’s Guidance on Risk Management  Internal Control and Related Financial and Business Reporting. The Board has carried out a robust assessment of the emerging and principal risks facing the Company  including those that would threaten its business model  future performance  solvency and liquidity. Further details of the risk management processes that are in place can be found in the Corporate Governance Statement. The Board's policy on risk management has not materially changed during the course of the reporting period and up to the date of this report. The Company maintains a framework of the key risks  with the policies and processes devised to monitor  manage and mitigate them where possible. This risk map is reviewed regularly by the Audit Committee. Further details of the financial risks are included in note 13 starting on page 61. The Company’s key risks fall broadly under the following categories: Principal Risks and Uncertainties Mitigation Macroeconomic Risks The performance of the Group’s investment portfolio is materially influenced by economic conditions. These may affect demand for services supplied by investee companies  foreign exchange rates  input costs  interest rates  debt and equity capital markets and the number of active trade and financial buyers. All of these factors could have an impact on the Group’s ability to realise a return from its investments and cannot be directly controlled by the Group. Particular current factors include high inflation  recession fears and sanctions related to the situation in Ukraine. Within the constraints dictated by its objective  the Company’s portfolio is diversified across a range of sectors  has no leverage  a net cash balance and  as set out below  the Portfolio Manager structures investments to provide downside protection  where possible. The Board  AIFM and Portfolio Manager monitor the macroeconomic environment and this is discussed at each Board meeting  along with the potential impact. The Portfolio Manager also provides a detailed update on the investments at each meeting  including  inter alia  developments in relation to the macro environment and trends. Strategy Implementation Risks The Group is subject to the risk that its long-term strategy and its level of performance fail to meet the expectations of its shareholders. A robust and sustainable corporate governance structure has been implemented with the Board responsible for continuing to act in the best interests of shareholders. An experienced fintech Portfolio Manager has been retained in order to deliver the strategy. Investment Risks The performance of the Group’s portfolio is influenced by a number of factors. These include  but are not limited to: (i) the quality of the initial investment decision; (ii) reliance on co-investment parties; (iii) the quality of the management team of each underlying portfolio company and the ability of that team to successfully implement its business strategy; (iv) the success of the Portfolio Manager in building an effective working relationship with each team in order to agree and implement value-creation strategies; (v) changes in the market or competitive environment in which each portfolio company operates; (vi) the macroeconomic risks described above; and (vii) environmental  social and governance (“ESG”) factors. Any of these factors could have an impact on the valuation of an investment and on the Group’s ability to realise the investment in a profitable and timely manner. The Company also invests in early-stage companies which  by their nature  may be smaller capitalisation companies. Such companies may not have the financial strength  diversity and the resources of larger and more established companies  and may find it more difficult to operate  especially in periods of low economic growth. The Portfolio Manager has put in place a rigorous investment process which ensures disciplined investment selection and portfolio management. This includes detailed due diligence  regular portfolio reviews and in many cases active engagement with portfolio companies by way of board representation or observer status. Investing in young businesses that may be cash consuming for a number of years is inherently risky. In order to reduce the risks of permanent capital loss the Portfolio Manager will  where possible  structure investments to afford a degree of downside protection through mechanisms such as a liquidation preference and/or anti-dilution provisions. As noted above the Portfolio Manager provides a detailed update at each Board meeting  including  inter alia  investee company developments and funding requirements. Portfolio Diversification Risk The Group is subject to the risk that its portfolio may not be diversified  being heavily concentrated in the fintech sector and the portfolio value may be dominated by a single or limited number of companies. The Group attempts to mitigate this risk by making investments across a range of companies in a range of fintech company subsectors and in companies at different stages of their lifecycle in accordance with the Investment Objective and Investment Policy. There is also geographic diversification with 66.6% of the portfolio being based in the UK and 33.4% in continental Europe  Israel and the US. Given the nature of the Company’s Investment Objective this remains a significant risk. Cash Risk Returns to the Company through holding cash and cash equivalents are currently low. The Company may hold significant cash balances  particularly when a fundraising has taken place  and this may have a drag on the Company’s performance. The Company may require cash to fund potential follow-on investments in existing investee companies. If the Company does not hold sufficient cash to participate in subsequent funding rounds carried out by portfolio companies  this could result in the interest the Company holds in such businesses being diluted. This may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position and returns for shareholders. To mitigate this risk the Board has agreed prudent cash management guidelines with the AIFM and Portfolio Manager. The Group maintains sufficient cash resources to manage its ongoing operational and investment commitments. Regular discussions are held to consider the future cash requirements of the Company and its investments to ensure that sufficient cash is maintained. Credit Risk As noted the Company may hold significant cash balances. There is a risk that the banks with which the cash is deposited fail and the Company could be adversely affected through either delay in accessing the cash deposits or the loss of the cash deposit. When evaluating counterparties there can be no assurance that the review will reveal or highlight all relevant facts and circumstances that may be necessary or helpful in evaluating the creditworthiness of the counterparty. The Board has agreed prudent cash management guidelines with the AIFM to ensure an appropriate risk/return profile is maintained. Cash and cash equivalents are held with approved counterparties  who are required to have a high credit rating and financial strength. Compliance with these guidelines is monitored regularly and reported to the Board on a quarterly basis. Valuation Risk The valuation of investments in accordance with IFRS 13 and International Private Equity and Venture Capital (IPEV) Valuation Guidelines requires considerable judgement and is explained in note 19.17. The Company’s investments are illiquid and a sale may require consent of other interested parties. Such investments may therefore be difficult to value and realise. Such realisations may involve significant time and cost and/or result in realisations at levels below the value of such investments as estimated by the Company. Valuations are often based on comparator prices and market-based multiples  which can be affected by equity market sentiment and comparators’ situations that may not reflect the individual positions of companies invested in. The Company has a rigorous valuation policy and process as set out in notes 19.4 and 19.17. This process is led by the Board and includes benchmarking valuations against actual prices received when a sale of shares is made  as well as taking account of liquidity issues and/or any restrictions over investments. Operational Risk The Board is reliant on the systems of the Group and Company’s service providers and as such disruption to  or a failure of  those systems could lead to a failure to comply with law and regulations leading to reputational damage and/or financial loss to the Group and/or Company. To manage these risks the Board: • receives a quarterly compliance report from the AIFM and the Portfolio Manager  which includes  inter alia  details of compliance with applicable laws and regulations; • reviews internal control reports  where available  key policies  including measures taken to combat cybersecurity issues  and also the disaster recovery procedures of its service providers; • maintains a risk matrix with details of risks to which the Group and Company are exposed  the controls relied on to manage those risks and the frequency of operation of the controls; and • receives updates on pending changes to the regulatory and legal environment and progress towards the Group and Company’s compliance with these. Key person risk There is a risk that the individuals responsible for managing the portfolio may leave their employment or may be prevented from undertaking their duties. The Board manages this risk by: • receiving reports from AFML at each Board meeting  such reports include any significant changes in the make-up of the team supporting the Company; • delegating to the Management Engagement & Remuneration Committee oversight of the remuneration of employees of AFML; • meeting the wider team  outside the designated lead managers  at the Portfolio Manager’s offices and by video conference  and encouraging the participation of the wider AFML team in investor updates; and • delegating to the Management Engagement & Remuneration Committee responsibility to perform an annual review of the service received from AFML  including  inter alia  the team supporting the lead managers and succession planning. Emerging Risks The Company has carried out a robust assessment of the Company’s emerging and principal risks and the procedures in place to identify emerging risks are described below. The International Risk Governance Council definition of an ‘emerging’ risk is one that is new  or is a familiar risk in a new or unfamiliar context or under new context conditions (re-emerging). Failure to identify emerging risks may cause mitigating actions to be reactive rather than being proactive and  in the worst case  could cause the Company to become unviable or otherwise fail or force the Company to change its structure  objective or strategy. The Audit Committee reviews the risk map at least half-yearly. Emerging risks are discussed in detail as part of this process and also throughout the year to try to ensure that emerging (as well as known) risks are identified and  so far as practicable  mitigated. The experience and knowledge of the Directors are useful in these discussions  as are update papers and advice received from the Board’s key service providers such as the Portfolio Manager  the AIFM and the Company’s Brokers. In addition  the Company is a member of the AIC  which provides regular technical updates as well as drawing members’ attention to forthcoming industry and/or regulatory issues and advising on compliance obligations. Ukraine The Board continues to monitor events in Ukraine and related sanctions. The Board remains confident that the situation should have no direct impact on the Company and has not identified any Russian shareholders in the Company. The portfolio companies have no Russian operations. ESG As mentioned above under Investment Risks  the Board recognises the risks posed by environmental  social and governance (“ESG”) factors  particularly with respect to the portfolio. Investment companies are currently exempt from reporting under the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”) and the Company has not voluntarily adopted the requirements  but recognises the potential for reputational risk should the Company not meet investor expectations in relation to ESG. This  together with ESG factors that might affect portfolio companies  is considered to be an emerging risk area for the Company. ESG risk assessment is embedded in the Portfolio Manager's due diligence and decision-making process when investing in new companies and monitored thereafter. Performance and Prospects Performance The Board assesses the Company’s performance in meeting its objective against the following Key Performance Indicators (“KPIs”). Due to the unique nature and investment policy of the Company  with no direct listed competitors or comparable indices  the Board considers that there is no relevant external comparison against which to assess the KPIs and as such performance against the KPIs is considered on an absolute basis. Information on the Company’s performance is provided in the Chairman’s Statement and the Portfolio Manager’s Review. The KPIs have not changed from the prior year: • The Net Asset Value (“NAV”) per share after performance fee total return* The Directors regard the Company’s NAV per share after performance fee total return as being the critical measure of value delivered to shareholders over the long term. The Board considers that the NAV per share after performance fee better reflects the current value of each share than the consolidated NAV per share figure  the calculation of which eliminates the performance fee. This is an Alternative Performance Measure (“APM”) and its calculation is explained in the Glossary on page 79 and in note 16 on page 64. Essentially  it adds back distributions made in the period to the change in the NAV after performance fee to arrive at a total return. The Group’s NAV per share after performance fee total return for the year was 2.4% (2022: 19.0%). This result is discussed in the Chairman's Statement on page 2. • The Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”)* The Directors also regard the Company’s TSR as a key indicator of performance. Like the NAV per share after performance fee total return discussed above  this is an APM and its calculation is explained in the Glossary on page 79. The TSR is similar in nature to the NAV per share after performance fee total return  except that it adds back distributions made in the period to the change in the share price  to reflect more closely the return in the hands of shareholders. Share price performance is monitored closely by the Board. The Company's TSR for the year was (27.1%) (2022: (16.4%)) reflecting the swing in market sentiment against listed growth and tech stocks from the beginning of 2022 and the associated wide discount to NAV at which the Company's shares have traded. • Ongoing Charges Ratio (“OCR”)* Ongoing charges represent the costs that shareholders can reasonably expect to pay from one year to the next  under normal circumstances. The Board is cognisant of costs and reviews the level of expenses at each Board meeting. It works hard to maintain a sensible balance between strong service and keeping costs down. The terms of appointment of the Company’s AIFM and the Portfolio Manager are set out on pages 23 and 24. In reviewing their continued appointment the Board took into account the ongoing charges ratio of other investment companies with specialist mandates. The Group’s OCR for the year was 1.9% (2022: 1.7%). Discount/Premium* The Board monitors the price of the Company's shares in relation to their net asset value after performance fee and the premium/discount at which the shares trade. Shareholder approvals are sought each year to issue and buy back shares  which can assist in reducing share price volatility. However  the level of discount or premium is understood to be mostly a function of investor sentiment and demand for the shares  over which the Board has little influence. The Portfolio Manager  the management fee arrangements and the Company’s cost base generally have not changed and the current discount follows an extended period during which the shares traded at a premium to NAV. The Board does not believe that Company specific factors have influenced the discount. Rather  the share price falling to a discount to NAV at the beginning of 2022 correlates with market sentiment turning against growth stocks generally  with the Company's shares being affected notwithstanding the portfolio’s potential. This situation continued unabated through the year under review. The Board has sought to communicate its faith in the underlying value of the portfolio and simultaneously to take advantage of the discount by undertaking a programme of accretive share buybacks  to the benefit of remaining shareholders. It is thought that helping to create additional market liquidity for sellers in this way also had an effect on stabilising the share price. All shares purchased are held in treasury and will potentially be reissued when the share price returns to a premium to NAV after performance fee. Shareholder authorities to issue and buy back shares are being sought at the forthcoming AGM. * See Glossary on page 79 Prospects The Company’s current position and prospects are described in the Chairman’s Statement and Portfolio Manager’s Review sections of this annual report. Performance and Future developments The Board’s primary focus is on the Portfolio Manager’s investment approach and performance. The subject is thoroughly discussed at every Board meeting. In addition  the AIFM updates the Board on company communications  promotions and investor feedback  as well as wider investment issues. An outline of performance  investment activity and strategy  market background during the year and the outlook is provided in the Chairman’s Statement on pages 2 to 4 and the Portfolio Manager’s Review on pages 15 to 17. Viability Statement The Board has considered the Company’s financial position  including its ability to liquidate portfolio assets and meet its expenses as they fall due  and notes the following: As part of its review the Board considered the impact of a significant and prolonged decline in the Company’s performance and prospects. This included a range of plausible downside scenarios such as reviewing the effects of substantial falls in investment values and the impact on the Company’s ongoing charges. The expenses of the Company are predictable and modest in comparison with the assets and there are no capital commitments currently foreseen which would alter that position. In considering the Company’s longer-term viability  as well as considering the principal risks on pages 18 to 21 and the financial position of the Company  the Board considered the following factors and assumptions: • The Company is and will continue to be invested primarily in long-term illiquid investments which are not publicly traded; • The Board reviews the liquidity of the Company  regularly considers any commitments it has and cash flow projections; • The Board  AIFM and Portfolio Manager will continue to adopt a long-term view when making investments and anticipated holding periods will be at least five years; • As detailed in the Directors’ Report  the Valuations Committee oversees the valuation process; • There will continue to be demand for investment trusts; • Regulation will not increase to a level that makes running the Company uneconomical; and • The performance of the Company will continue to be satisfactory. Whilst acknowledging that market and economic uncertainty remain heightened in view of current inflation  concerns about a recession and the Ukraine conflict  based on the results of its review  and taking into account the long-term nature of the Company  the Board has a reasonable expectation that the Company will be able to continue its operations and meet its expenses and liabilities as they fall due for the foreseeable future  taken to mean at least the next five years. The Board has chosen this period because  whilst it has no information to suggest this judgement will need to change in the coming five years  forecasting over longer periods is imprecise. The Board’s long-term view of viability will  of course  be updated each year in the annual report. Going Concern In light of the conclusions drawn in the foregoing Viability Statement and as set out in note 19.1 to the financial statements on page 65  the Company has adequate financial resources to continue in operational existence for at least the next 12 months from the date of signing of this report. Therefore  the Directors believe that it is appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. In reviewing the position as at the date of this report  the Board has considered the guidance on this matter issued by the Financial Reporting Council.
