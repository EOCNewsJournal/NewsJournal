One maj…,Belgium hosts a number of international financial market infrastructures (FMIs)  such as Swift and Euroclear  which act as critical nodes in the smooth functioning of Belgian and international financial markets and payment services. One major event that marked 2022 was of course Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Since the invasion and particularly the sanctions that were imposed as a result  these institutions have become more widely known to the general public  as they contribute to the implementation of these sanctions. In this challenging geopolitical environment  cyber security is of the utmost importance to FMIs. The video below shows how the National Bank of Belgium encourages the financial sector to take the necessary steps to improve its cyber resilience.The Financial Market Infrastructures and Payment Services Report provides an overview of the impact of the sanctions resulting from Russia's invasion of Ukraine on some of the institutions subject to the National Bank of Belgium's oversight and supervision. It also reviews the regulatory changes and supervisory activities in 2022 relating to these institutions.These critical players need to manage their operational risk very carefully in order to guarantee financial stability. Digital operational resilience was therefore again one of the NBB's top priorities in 2022. The Report provides an update on the EU Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA)  which entered into force in January 2023 and is intended to mitigate the risks associated with the digital transformation of the financial sector by introducing common rules. Furthermore  a thematic article on the TIBER-BE programme illustrates how the National Bank aims to improve the cyber resilience of Belgian critical market infrastructures and core financial institutions.Emerging technologies such as distributed ledger technology (DLT) are being closely monitored by the authorities to assess their potential impact on financial stability. The EU Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA)  for example  seeks to ensure a level playing field for consumer protection while stimulating innovation  financial stability  monetary policy transmission and monetary sovereignty. The Report also provides an update on the ongoing investigation phase regarding the implications of the issuance of a digital euro.Environmental and climate-related risks are another type of risk that has been receiving increased attention from the NBB and society at large. Another thematic article provides an update on these risks within the FMI landscape.,neutral,0.0,0.99,0.0,negative,0.0,0.06,0.94,True,English,"['financial market infrastructures', 'payment service providers', 'Banque nationale', 'Cyber resilience', 'top priority', 'Belgique', 'Belgium', 'EU Digital Operational Resilience Act', 'international financial market infrastructures', 'The Financial Market Infrastructures', 'Belgian critical market infrastructures', 'The EU Markets', 'international financial markets', 'One major event', 'challenging geopolitical environment', 'distributed ledger technology', 'level playing field', 'ongoing investigation phase', 'monetary policy transmission', 'core financial institutions', 'Payment Services Report', 'cyber resilience', 'digital transformation', 'The Report', 'digital euro', 'operational risk', 'critical nodes', 'financial sector', 'critical players', 'financial stability', 'monetary sovereignty', 'smooth functioning', 'general public', 'cyber security', 'National Bank', 'necessary steps', 'regulatory changes', 'supervisory activities', 'top priorities', 'common rules', 'thematic article', 'TIBER-BE programme', 'Emerging technologies', 'Crypto-Assets Regulation', 'consumer protection', 'FMI landscape', 'potential impact', 'climate-related risks', 'Belgium', 'number', 'FMIs', 'Swift', 'Euroclear', 'course', 'Russia', 'invasion', 'Ukraine', 'sanctions', 'result', 'implementation', 'importance', 'video', 'overview', 'oversight', 'supervision', 'order', 'NBB', 'update', 'DORA', 'force', 'January', 'DLT', 'authorities', 'MiCA', 'example', 'innovation', 'implications', 'issuance', 'Environmental', 'type', 'attention', 'society', '2022']",2023-07-05,2023-07-06,marketscreener.com

Today  Stellantis brands offer 26 vehicle nameplates in those segments on a variety of platforms. Up to two million vehicles per year can be built on the STLA Medium platform in several plants across the world  starting in Europe this year.“What we see today is the product of just over two years of no-compromise innovation to deliver clean  safe and affordable mobility  supported by our €30 billion investment in electrification and software through 2025 ” said Carlos Tavares  Stellantis CEO. “The STLA Medium platform demonstrates the power of the global Stellantis technical community  delivering products that are hyper-focused on our customers and rewriting long-held assumptions of transportation as we drive for carbon net zero by 2038.”STLA Medium is the first of four global BEV platforms  outlined on EV Day 2021  that underpin the Company’s future products and are key to achieving the bold targets of the Stellantis Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan  including reaching a 100% passenger car battery electric vehicle (BEV) sales mix in Europe and a 50% passenger car and light-duty truck BEV sales mix in the United States by 2030. Dare Forward 2030 is led by deep emission cuts to slash CO2 in half by 2030  benchmarking the 2021 metrics  and achieve carbon net zero by 2038  with single-digit percentage compensation of the remaining emissions.STLA Medium Is Fitted to Exceed Customer ExpectationsThe BEV-by-design STLA Medium platform delivers best-in-class range of more than 700 km (435 miles) with a Performance pack  while a Standard pack is rated at more than 500 km (310 miles) on the Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure (WLTP). With a useful energy up to 98 kilowatt-hours (kWh)  STLA Medium is best in class in embedded energy between the wheels.STLA Medium  which uses a 400-volt electric architecture  will deliver best-in-class energy efficiency and charging time and connectivity to a charging and services ecosystem that enhances every journey. Depending on the application  consumption can be less than 14 kWh per 100 km  which is best in class in energy efficiency. Owners will be able to take their battery from 20% to 80% charge in 27 minutes  a rate of 2.4 kWh per minute.Vehicles based on STLA Medium will be sold globally and be available with front-drive propulsion or all-wheel drive with the addition of a second electric drive module at the rear  with BEV power output range from 160 to 285 kW.Body styles will include passenger cars  crossovers and SUVs. The flexibility of STLA Medium gives Stellantis designers the freedom to create vehicles with:A wheelbase that can range between 2 700-2 900 millimetersAn overall length range of 4.3-4.9 metersGround clearance of more than 220 mm to ensure off-road capability and performanceWheels up to 750 mm in diameter  a key attribute for the platform design.Stellantis engineering and manufacturing experts focused on making installation of the modular  high-energy density single-layer battery pack at the assembly plant as efficient as possible  maximizing space inside the vehicle and improving ride and handling with a low center of gravity. Platform components  such as the cabin heating/cooling system  steering  braking assist and propulsion are designed to minimize energy consumption. Those efforts combine with extensive use of lightweight and rigid materials to optimize vehicle range and deliver exemplary ride and handling performance.STLA Medium will deliver best-in-class battery packaging cost that also enhances production volumes. The perimeter dimensions of the battery pack are constant among the stored energy options  with common tray and cooling designs.Future-Proof PlatformsThe STLA platform family (Small/Medium/Large/Frame) is engineered to be future proof – modular and inherently flexible in wheelbase  width  overhang  ride height and suspension design. The capabilities and performance of STLA based vehicles will adapt and improve over the years with the implementation of the STLA Brain architecture  STLA SmartCockpit and STLA AutoDrive platforms – enabling over-the-air updates to software and enhanced hardware.The engineered-in flexibility includes propulsion – front-drive  rear-drive  all-wheel drive and multi-energy – covered by a family of three  scalable electric drive modules (EDMs).The platforms are designed with provisions for future battery chemistries  including nickel- and cobalt-free and solid-state batteries. This enables Stellantis brands to tailor vehicle capabilities for the ideal balance of cost and performance.# # #About StellantisStellantis N.V.

They ride Colnago bikes which have an Italian heritage but the company is now owned by Chimera  one of the many companies chaired by TBZ.The team can be traced back to 1990 when it was Colnago-LampreIneos Grenadiers (Great Britain) is a petrochemicals company that manufactures and supplies the chemicals to make the plastics that surround us and it’s grown so big it’s now drilling for oil and gas for raw materials and energy to power its chemical plants. It’s a private firm owned by James “Jim” Ratcliffe  Britain’s third richest person who left a career at oil major BP to buy up unloved chemical factories. He bought the cycling team for fun and also has a sailing team  owns French football club OGC Nice  is a sponsor and part owner of the Mercedes Formula 1 team and is currently bidding for Manchester United. Why? Because he can  and they help with dealmaking too  VIP opportunities galore. The Grenadiers name is a side project to produce a genuine utility vehicle but comes with a premium price tag so you won’t see it on many farms; the team doesn’t use it either.The team began in 2010 as Team Sky and was built on the back of Team GB’s success on the road and trackGroupama-FDJ (France) is 50-50 joint venture owned by its two sponsors. If you want to sound très French then pronounce it Groupama-FDG. Groupama is a giant mutual insurance company which means policy holders own the company  it’s not quite a non-profit but you get the picture. The rural logo hints at the original name Groupe des Assurances Mutuelles Agricoles. FDJ is short for La Française des Jeux. It’s the French lottery which is now privatised but has committed to fund both the men’s and women’s teams for several years so no change on the horizon. The team is quintessentially French right down to the tricolore kit but look to them to add some more foreign signings soon. The team doesn’t have a women’s team but it does share FDJ and also bike sponsor Lapierre with FDJ-Suez  interestingly the women’s team is packed with blue chip corporate sponsors like Suez  France’s Carte Bleue (a Gallic version of Visa/Mastercard) and so on  a sign how women’s cycling is on the up with a big lift from the Tour Féminin.The team began in 1997 and has kept the same sponsor all along; in 2012 it was FDJ-BigMat and then Groupama took a 50% share for 2018EF Education-Easypost (USA) is owned by EF Education First  a language education business that was started in Sweden and now HQ’d in Switzerland  presumably for tax rather than the mountain air. EF Education First sounds like a pleonasm but loyal readers will know the initials EF actually stand for Europeiska Ferieskolan  Swedish for “European Holiday Schools” because this is what the founder Bertil Hult named his venture and it’s grown to a big business making the Hult family billionaires. The team’s seemingly changed name every year but this year has seen continuity from last thanks to Easypost  a company ships small goods and packets for e-commerce.The team began as a junior development team in 2003  became a pro team in 2007Soudal-Quick-Step (Belgium  Luxembourg) has seen Belgian chemicals company Soudal switch teams over the winter  the company owner attracted by the prospect of backing Remco Evenepoel  an unsticky move for a company that normally markets how strong its adhesives are  it makes glue for building sites  think tile adhesives and that sort of thing. Quick-Step may seem quintessentially Flemish but it belongs to a in Amsterdam… Amsterdam  New York called Mohawk Industries  a giant supplier of commercial and residential flooring. The team vibes construction site sponsors which part explains the blue overalls team kit – workers in Europe often wear blue dungarees – is owned by Zdeněk Bakala  a Czech billionaire and benefactor who’s a keen cyclist and he has helped to top up the budget over the years.Quick Step’s sponsorship began in 2003 but the team is an assembly of mergers over the years and can be traced back to the 1990sBahrain Victorious (Bahrain) is backed by the oil-rich island in the Middle East. It’s harsh regime that sits 171st of the press freedom index and scores as badly for other measures of openness and freedoms but this blogger better say nice things about because you can get jailed for tweeting criticism. It’s a case study in “sportwashing”  using sport to present a dynamic image of the sponsor all while not ever washing anything away  more a power play to plant a flag. It’s also personal project led by a Bahrain prince who likes his cycling  triathlon and more.Started in 2017Bora-Hansgrohe (Germany) is a German team sponsored by two Mittelstand manufacturers. Bora makes kitchen extractor fans with the selling point that the fans are located beside the cooking hob rather than above The firm has experienced prodigious growth since it started sponsoring a team and has a cycling-mad boss  he even hired Les Amis de Paris-Roubaix  the group that protects the pavé  to clay cobbles on the driveway of the new corporate HQ. Hansgrohe make plumbing parts like taps and shower heads and if they have a Germany history since being founded by Herr Hans Grohe in 1901 are these days majority owned by US conglomerate Masco. Don’t confuse them with arch rival Grohe  the plumbing version of Adidas vs Puma.The team started in 2010 as Team NetAppLidl-Trek (USA  Belgium) is the brand new combination of Germany discount supermarket Lidl and US bike brand Trek  with Lidl replacing coffee firm Segafredo. The German retailer is expanding around the world  opening up new shops in the US these days with an established presence across Europe and this means the new sponsor wants riders from around the world. The new retail sponsorship means more money and the squad is going on a shopping spree in the transfer market as you read this. It’s worth saying aloud that this is one of the few big semi-global consumer-facing companies to come and sponsor a team.Began in 2011 as Leopard-TrekAg2r Citroën (France) features French social insurance company Ag2r La Mondiale  which offers top-up health insurance and pension plans to savers in France. A rival to Groupama  it’s also mutually-owned and has grown via mergers to become one of France’s biggest insurance companies although the kind that if they didn’t sponsor a team maybe nobody would have heard of it. The co-sponsor Citroën  the car manufacturer that is now a brand within Stellantis  one of those companies named by an agency  that also owns Opel  Dodge  Maserati  Fiat and Chrysler among other brands. It’s a big sponsor that has helped the team up the budget but they blew a chunk of it on good but ageing riders on the decline and are now shopping for riders to replace the likes of Greg Van Avermaet.Ag2r is a title sponsor since 2000 and the team was founded in 1992 as ChazalAlpecin-Deceuninck (Belgium) are newly promoted in the World Tour. Alpecin is a shampoo brand from Germany with caffeine in it (reviewed on this blog) and you wonder if they’re forbidden from signing a balding rider. Oddly for a team that gets giant exposure in France  the shampoo’s not for sale in supermarkets nor pharmacies in France. Continuing the Belgian construction site theme  Deceuninck’s a Belgian maker of PVC windows and doors  a company worth €315 million on the Euronext stock exchange.It began as a cyclo-cross team in 2009Intermarché-Circus-Wanty (Belgium) is sponsored by Intermarché  a supermarket group from Brittany in France but the sponsorship deal is with the Belgian subsidiary rather than the parent company which is odd given they’re racing around France now  you’d think the HQ could chip in as well. Circus is a bookmaker and casino in Belgium and Wanty does civil engineering  think building bridges or specialist demolition projects. Are you a member of a cycling club? If so  could it ride the Tour de France in the future? Unlikely but this team began out of a tiny local cycling club  the VC Ath  in the 1970s and has climbed up the rungs  becoming a regional team  then a national U23 team  then a UCI Continental and now it’s in the World Tour and racing around France this month.It went pro in 2011 as Willems Veranda-AccentCofidis (France) is a French consumer lending company which has now expanded to offering loans in Spain  Italy and central Europe making the cycling team a useful marketing tool. It’s aimed at those needing cash at the lower end of the market  for all the “cycling is the new golf” in the US  UK and Australia  in France and other core nations it’s cycling is still a working class demographic and so Cofidis can reach its target market. They have a paracycling team and a women’s team as well. Cofidis is now part of the Crédit Mutuel financial group which also owns online bank Arkéa  more of which soon.A continuous presence since 1997Movistar (Spain) is a mobile telecoms operator that belongs to Telefonica with activities in Spain and Latin America and has a sub brand in O2 which is used in Spain but also Germany  the UK and other markets. They’ve signed a small agreement with the Saudi Arabia cycling federation to “share knowledge” with the unspoken goal of taking on sponsorship from the kingdom but as reported by Relevo  the “speed is a little slower than we’d sometimes like”. Business deals with Saudi Arabia can take time and unlike Jumbo-Visma the team can’t wow the sponsors in the same way  it’s not the same franchise.This is the longest surviving team in the peloton with a lineage going back to 1980 and the Reynolds team with José Miguel Echavarri at the helm for most of the time before handing over to Eusebio Unzué  and now his son Sebastian Unzué is picking up the reinsTeam dsm-firmenich (Switzerland  Netherlands) DSM used to mean Dutch State Mines  a company founded in 1902 to extract coal from the Limburg region but it’s become a life sciences group that makes chemicals for vitamins as well as Dyneema  a type of plastic that is popular as material for sailing boats and used in lightweight cycling shoes too. It’s just merged with Swiss chemicals company Firmenich so the sponsor is two names but one company – based in Switzerland – and the team is seen as part of the marketing message  so much so that it’s getting a top up in cash to shop for new names which might alter the developmental vocation of the squad. Dutch telecoms provider Youfone is very visible on the kit  at times more than DSM  but just a co-sponsor.A quiet story of growth that goes back to Shimano–Memory Corp in 2005 via Skil and Argos OilIsrael-PremierTech (Israel) is backed by Israeli-Canadian real estate billionaire Sylvain Adam  a keen cyclist who recently migrated to Israel and has been spending his fortune to promote the country. You might play Velogames and spend an imaginary 100 credits  Adams does it with his cash although he used up a lot of budget to hire Chris Froome and the team got relegated and it’s now looking to change its image. PremierTech is a Canadian horticulture company that start out digging up and selling peat  today it sells fertiliser as well.Adams bought the Katusha licence which bought Oleg Tinkov’s Tinkoff Credit systems team which began in 2006Jayco-Al Ula (Australia  Switzerland) is backed by Gerry Ryan  one of Australia’s wealthiest people thanks to his Jayco caravan business – Australia’s largest vehicle manufacturer ever since Ford and GM/Opel pulled out – and canny investments along the way such as the Walking With Dinosaurs show. For years the team has been hunting for a commercial sponsorship deal to top up their Australian benefactor and they’ve got Al Ula  a tourist destination in Saudi Arabia.Greenedge began in 2012 and has struggled to land a title sponsor  it’s had Orica and Scott along the wayArkéa-Samsic (France) isn’t just a French team it’s a Breton team  with Arkéa being an online consumer banking brand inside the Crédit Mutuel group  the parent company of Cofidis too. Samsic is a recruitment agency also from Brittany but growing across Europe  it has operations in Italy for example which means the team likes to race in Italy too. Newly promoted to the World Tour after some crafty points-hunting in the past seasons  they’ve made the top tier but now seem to be wondering what to do  there’s talk of signing Arnaud Démare but he’ll be 32 soon and an improvement as their house sprinter but this is a team in need of a project. Samsic’s stepping down at the end of the year and the Breton team will get B&B Hotels on board  the fast-growing hotel operator returning to the sport.The team began in 2005 as Bretagne–Jean Floc’h and under the patronage of Breton political bigwig Jean-Yves Le Drian  the former French foreign minister (2017-2022)Lotto-Dstny (Belgium) is the longest continuous team sponsorship in pro cycling with the Belgian state lottery backing a team through various name changes over the years ever since 1985 and the national lottery makes them a national team in Belgian  with the need to recruit both Flemish and Walloon riders. Relegated last year  the fall didn’t stop them from getting Dstny on board  it’s a Belgian telecoms and communications company that now operates in several European countries and CEO Daan De Wever said he didn’t quite realise the team’s predicament at the time. He’s is an active sponsor who has been vocal in wanting more results from the deal but if he’s patient the team’s got a good pipeline of U23 talent.The team goes back to 1985Astana (Kazakhstan  Luxembourg) was the capital of Kazakhstan – it’s Kazakh for “capital city” – but the city was renamed Nur-Sultan in tribute to the country’s long term ruler Nursultan Nazarbayev. The Astana name has been consistent for years but the funding source being the team has changed  the country’s sovereign wealth fund backed the team but when rider wages became unpaid the Presidential Sports Club took over. But this was closed down last year and the Samruk Kazyna fund is back to bankrolling the team. Once one of the top teams in the sport  it’s budget has stayed flat while rivals have overtaken it and it’s becoming a bit a career graveyard  riders who join can struggle to get out.Title sponsor since 2007 when the team was born out of the ashes of the Liberty Seguros team which was engulfed by Operation PuertoUno-X (Norway) is a new name in the Tour de France  a chain of fuel stations that’s pivoting to become a supplier of charging points for electric vehicles in Norway and Denmark too. There are several names on the kit like Uno-X  Reitan and Rema-1000 but they’re all under the same corporate umbrella of Reitan  a Norwegian conglomerate with activities in Denmark too but that’s it  the publicity this July and beyond is all about reaching the audiences there and paradoxically the more success Jonas Vinegaard has  the more their exposure rises in Denmark. The squad’s looking for a co-sponsor and given the rumours about the signings they’ve been making  must have found one. They’re an invitee team riding on a wildcard but look set to become a fixture given the strength of the squad.Goes back to 2010 as third tier Conti outfit Team Ringeriks-Kraft and moved up to the second tier in 2020TotalEnergies (France) is backed by French oil major Total  or TotalEnergies as it’s now called. The oil giant got into cycling by accident when it acquired Direct Energie  an alternative electricity supplier in France but has used the team as a vehicle to help with the rebranding from Total to TotalEnergies and the sponsor does everything from service stations to lubricants  alternative energy to drilling for oil and gas. The team’s heart is from the Vendée region and unlike its sponsors  very much a family business more than a multinational. The signing of Peter Sagan can be spun as beneficial for the way he helped inspire others but results-wise it’s a Total flop and the team need to rebuild and reinvest otherwise they’ll be a precarious position and could find themselves without an invitation to the Tour in the coming years which would be ruinous but if there’s a sponsor with cash to spare it’s TotalEnergies  current market value is €130 billion.Born out of the Vendée-U team  the pro team began in 2000 as Bonjour and was Bouygues and Europcar along the wayConclusionThere’s no single theme here  although if you want to build a home in northern France with some finance you could tap into a lot of the sponsors. Some sponsors are in it as a marketing project and want to influence your spending habits and wallet  others have less strict criteria. Some barely seem to have commercial purposes and marketing goals  there are benefactors and sugar-daddy sponsors in it for fun  and also nation states whether just Belgium and its state lottery  or Middle-Eastern countries hungry for recognition and trying to convert some of their petrodollars into soft power. It’s can be called sportswashing but there’s no lather  there’s no laundry  it’s almost the opposite where sponsors with dirty linen can drape this in public and everyone else has to deal with it.Pro cycling as a “product” is complicated  with vastly different audience demographics from country to country which makes it an awkward sell for many consumer-facing brands  in one country it reaches high income professionals  it another it’s the other end of the scale.Finally for all the big companies involved  the biggest sponsors in cycling aren’t at the Tour de France. At $450 billion United Healthcare might have a market capitalisation bigger than any of the companies named above combined  Novo Nordisk is similar too and both have teams but for now they’re side projects and second tier UCI Pro Teams rather than flagship sponsorship projects.,positive,0.6,0.4,0.01,mixed,0.52,0.2,0.28,True,English,"['pro team sponsors', 'inrng', 'Sheikh Tahnoun bin Zayed Al Nahyan', 'Groupe des Assurances Mutuelles Agricoles', 'La Française des', 'blue chip corporate sponsors', 'Norwegian IT services company', 'giant mutual insurance company', 'real estate Sheikh', 'start list order', 'Dutch supermarket chain', 'leading food retailers', 'Wout van Aert', 'national security advisor', 'James “Jim” Ratcliffe', 'third richest person', 'genuine utility vehicle', 'premium price tag', 'Tour Féminin', 'European Holiday Schools', 'payroll services company', 'unloved chemical factories', 'French football club', 'EF Education First', 'language education business', 'United Arab Emirates', 'gas rich state', 'Chinese replacement sponsor', '50-50 joint venture', 'Tour de France', 'Mercedes Formula 1 team', 'junior development team', 'The Grenadiers name', 'Belgian chemicals company', 'Pro Team Sponsors', 'giant supplier', 'UAE-Team Emirates', 'Ineos Grenadiers', 'chemical plants', 'Manchester United', 'French lottery', 'EF Education-Easypost', 'initials EF', 'big business', 'many sponsors', 'two sponsors', 'petrochemicals company', 'company owner', 'household goods', 'closer look', 'next yearf', 'Saudi Arabia', 'new backer', 'Abu Dhabi', 'last minute', 'ruling family', 'sports fan', 'Colnago bikes', 'Italian heritage', 'many companies', 'raw materials', 'private firm', 'major BP', 'OGC Nice', 'part owner', 'VIP opportunities', 'side project', 'many farms', 'policy holders', 'rural logo', 'original name', 'several years', 'tricolore kit', 'foreign signings', 'sponsor Lapierre', 'Carte Bleue', 'Gallic version', 'big lift', 'same sponsor', 'mountain air', 'loyal readers', 'Europeiska Ferieskolan', 'Bertil Hult', 'Hult family', 'last thanks', 'small goods', 'Remco Evenepoel', 'unsticky move', 'building sites', 'New York', 'UAE flag', 'UAE president', 'Kwantum team', 'Lampre team', 'sailing team', 'Team Sky', 'Team GB', 'Great Britain', 'cycling team', '22 teams', 'variety', 'governments', 'Jumbo-Visma', 'Netherlands', 'Yumbo', 'family-owned', 'Belgium', 'deal', 'sponsorship', 'end', 'notice', 'funding', 'Superconfex', 'Buckler', 'Wordperfect', 'Rabobank', 'Belkin', 'LottoNL', 'Switzerland', 'federation', 'kingdoms', 'capital', 'oil', 'time', 'success', 'jersey', 'brother', 'TBZ', 'region', 'Chimera', 'Colnago-Lampre', 'plastics', 'energy', 'career', 'road', 'track', 'Groupama-FDJ', 'Groupama-FDG', 'picture', 'Jeux', 'women', 'change', 'horizon', 'FDJ-Suez', 'Visa/Mastercard', 'FDJ-BigMat', '50% share', 'USA', 'Sweden', 'tax', 'pleonasm', 'founder', 'continuity', 'packets', 'e-commerce', 'Soudal-Quick-Step', 'Luxembourg', 'winter', 'prospect', 'strong', 'adhesives', 'tile', 'sort', 'thing', 'Amsterdam', 'commercial']",2023-07-05,2023-07-06,inrng.com

As at December 31  2022 ...,Press release - Thursday  July 6  2023 - 5.45pmArgan repaid its bond in an amount of €130mwithout refinancing needs thus confirming tight control over its debtAs planned  ARGAN has just proceeded to the repayment of its bond in an amount of €130m  issued in June 2017  at a fixed rate of 3.25%. Note that ARGAN had set this amount aside following the bond in an amount of €500m that was issued at particularly favourable conditions in November 2021 (with a rate of 1.011% for a maturity in November 2026). Most of Argan's debt (68% at end of 2022) is comprised of mortgage loans (asset by asset) with ongoing amortization  which - as a result - does not require any refinancing in the short term.Estimated at 2.4% for 2023  the cost of debt remains under tight controlMoreover  as Argan's cost of debt is marginally exposed to Euribor 3-month rate variations (only 8% of the gross debt at the end of 2022)  it thus has very little sensitivity to the increase of market interest rates observed since the first half-year of 2022.As a result  taking into account an average projected Euribor 3-month rate at 3.4% for the full year 2023  the average cost of debt would stand at 2.4%.With a BBB- (stable outlook) rating that was confirmed last February by S&P  ARGAN is thus reinforcing the quality of its signature. Announced at the start of the year  Argan's debt reduction strategy results in gradual and constant decrease in the amount of gross debt. This is linked to a double effect stemming from the natural amortization of mortgage loans (about €100m / year) and  selectively  from the proceeds of targeted sales of warehouses at the end of 2024 or early 2025  depending on market conditions.Financial calendar 2023 (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)July 19: 2023 Half-year resultsOctober 2: 2023 3rd quarter salesAbout ArganARGAN is the only French real estate company specializing in the DEVELOPMENT & RENTAL OF PREMIUM WAREHOUSES listed on EURONEXT.As at December 31  2022  ARGAN's portfolio amounted to 3.5 million sq.m  comprising approximately 100 warehouses located exclusively in France  valued at €4.0 billion.
