The bulk of the seized funds is at Euroclear  where it reportedly generated around ‚Ç¨750 million in interest during the first quarter of the year.""We‚Äôve all faced the Euroclear and Clearstream problem. We believe that one of the Persian Gulf states could host the new financial depository  given the concentration of the capital in that region ‚Äù Kostin said  at the Bank of Russia Financial Congress in St. Petersburg.Euroclear settles securities trades on European exchanges and serves as a securities central depository for financial institutions operating in Europe. The company ceased transactions with Russia‚Äôs National Settlement Depository (NSD) and blocked NSD accounts within its system in line with sanctions against the Russian clearing house imposed in mid-2022. The move effectively made Russians unable to access their assets held within Euroclear. It has been estimated that Russian assets stuck at Euroclear amount to ‚Ç¨196.6 billion ($211.1 billion)  the vast majority of which is owned by the country‚Äôs central bank.Kostin also called for an alternative to SWIFT  the international financial messaging system. Russian banks were cut off SWIFT last year  which made it impossible for them to carry out transactions with foreign financial institutions.According to the banker  new tools to attract capital should also be developed.‚ÄúToday it‚Äôs mostly Eurobonds. The entire financial infrastructure is built in the West. We propose to create new instruments which would respond to the needs of national currency and market regulation ‚Äù Kostin explained. The new financial infrastructure will attract Western investors and companies  he added.Following the imposition of sanctions against it  Russia and its trading partners among developing nations have intensified efforts to reduce the use of the Western financial system and replace the US dollar and the euro with national currencies for settlements in trade. The trend is supported by the members of BRICS  the economic bloc uniting Brazil  Russia  India  China and South Africa  and many other nations who want to join the union. Among the currencies that have been used instead of the US dollar are the Russian ruble  Chinese yuan  and UAE dirham.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section",neutral,0.01,0.98,0.0,negative,0.0,0.15,0.85,True,English,"['EU clearing houses', 'Russia', 'alternative', 'international depository settlement hub', 'international financial messaging system', 'new securities depository exchange', 'EU securities transactions companies', 'securities central depository', 'National Settlement Depository', 'new financial depository', 'entire financial infrastructure', 'new financial infrastructure', 'foreign financial institutions', 'many other nations', 'largest bank VTB', 'Russian clearing house', 'Western financial system', 'Persian Gulf states', 'Russia Financial Congress', 'Central Bank assets', 'securities trades', 'new tools', 'new instruments', 'developing nations', 'national currency', 'Western investors', 'Russian assets', 'Russian banks', 'Russian ruble', 'first quarter', 'St. Petersburg', 'European exchanges', 'vast majority', 'market regulation', 'trading partners', 'US dollar', 'economic bloc', 'South Africa', 'Chinese yuan', 'UAE dirham', 'business section', 'national currencies', 'Western sanctions', 'top banker', 'NSD accounts', 'Andrey Kostin', 'Clearstream problem', 'Euroclear amount', 'alternative', 'CEO', 'Thursday', 'Belgium', 'Luxembourg', 'billions', 'Moscow', 'bulk', 'funds', 'interest', 'year', 'concentration', 'capital', 'region', 'company', 'line', 'mid-20', 'move', 'Russians', 'country', 'SWIFT', 'Eurobonds', 'needs', 'efforts', 'settlements', 'trend', 'members', 'BRICS', 'Brazil', 'India', 'China', 'union', 'stories', 'economy', 'finance']",2023-07-06,2023-07-07,rt.com

No. 556713-3425  proposes that the annual general meeting on 17 August 2023 resolves to implement a long-term incentive program for the company's CBDO and COO  based on issue of warrants (the ""Warrants Program 2023/2028"").The English text is an unofficial translation. In case of any discrepancies between the Swedish text and the English translation  the Swedish text shall prevail.As the warrants in the Warrants Program 2023/2028 will be issued to the participants at their fair market value  it is the company's assessment that no social costs will occur for the company as a result of the Warrants Program 2023/2028. The costs related to theIn case all warrants are exercised for subscription of new shares  the share capital will increase with SEK 6 750.A share that has been issued by virtue of a warrant confers the right to dividend the first time on the record date for dividends that occurs immediately following effectuation of subscription to such extent that the share has been recorded in the company's share ledger as interim share.Subscription of shares by virtue of the warrants may be effected from and including 1 June 2028 to and including 30 June 2028.Each warrant entitles the right to subscribe for one new share in the company for a subscription price per share corresponding to 200 per cent of the volume weighted average price according to Spotlight Stock Market's official price list for shares in the company during the ten trading days that follows immediately after the publication of the company's interim report for April - June 2023. The subscription price shall be rounded to the nearest whole √∂re  whereupon 0.5 √∂re shall be rounded upwards. The amount that exceeds the share's quota value shall be added to the free share premium fund.Payment for the warrants shall be made against cash consideration no later than one week from the time of subscription  with a right for the board of directors to prolong this period.The warrants shall be issued to the fair market value of the warrants at the time of subscription  which shall be determined by an independent valuation institute in accordance with the Black & Scholes valuation formula.

The dilution had only had a marginal effect on the key figure earnings per share for the financial year 2022/2023.There are currently outstanding incentive programs in the company in the form of three warrants programs through which a maximum of 582 000 new shares may be issued if all warrants issued and held by participants are exercised for subscription of shares. If all warrants issued and held by participants and are proposed to be issued under Warrants Program 2023/2028 are fully exercised for subscription of shares  a total of 732 000 new shares will be issued  which corresponds to a total dilution of approximately 2.46 per cent of the company's share capital and votes after full dilution.The above calculations regarding dilution and impact on key ratios are subject to recalculation of the warrants in accordance with the customary recalculation terms set out in the complete terms and conditions for the warrants.Preparation of the proposalThe proposal for the Warrants Program 2023/2028 has been prepared by the board of directors in consultation with external consultants.Majority requirementsThe board of directors' proposal to implement the Warrants Program 2023/2028 is subject to the provisions in Chapter 16 of the Swedish Companies Act  and a valid resolution hence requires that the proposal is supported by shareholders representing at least nine-tenths of the votes cast as well as of all shares represented at the meeting.____________________The company's Chairman of the board of directors  or anyone appointed by him  shall be authorized to make minor formal adjustments of the resolution which may be required for registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office or Euroclear Sweden AB.____________________Lund in July 2023The Board of Directors of EQL Pharma AB (publ)3",neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,negative,0.0,0.16,0.84,True,English,"['long-term incentive program', 'EQL Pharma', 'Resolution', 'implementation', 'free share premium fund', 'EQL Pharma Group', 'negative taxation consequences', ""shareholders' preferential rights"", 'annual general meeting', 'EQL Pharma AB', 'ten trading days', 'key figure earnings', 'outstanding incentive programs', 'Spotlight Stock Market', 'independent valuation institute', 'Scholes valuation formula', 'fair market value', 'official price list', 'long-term incentive program', 'nearest whole √∂re', 'three warrants programs', 'separate subscription list', 'one new share', 'preliminary valuation', 'quota value', 'average price', 'overall reason', 'competent staff', 'following distribution', 'following terms', 'English text', 'unofficial translation', 'Swedish text', 'English translation', '200 per cent', 'interim report', 'cash consideration', '0.51 per cent', 'full utilization', 'marginal effect', 'financial year', 'share capital', 'share ledger', 'interim share', 'social costs', 'limited costs', 'new shares', 'subscription price', 'record date', 'lower number', 'full dilution', '0.5 √∂re', '150,000 warrants', 'participants', 'time', 'company', 'agreement', 'employment', 'connection', 'allotment', '15 September', 'board', 'directors', 'period', 'implementation', 'deviation', 'possibilities', 'CBDO', 'COO', 'accordance', 'maximum', 'framework', 'issue', 'conditions', 'Reg.', '17 August', 'case', 'discrepancies', 'assessment', 'result', 'SEK', 'virtue', 'dividends', 'effectuation', 'extent', '1 June', '30 June', 'volume', 'publication', 'April', 'amount', 'Payment', 'Black', 'assignment', 'turn', 'administration', 'notice', 'total', 'votes']",2023-07-06,2023-07-07,marketscreener.com

The bulk of the seized funds is at Euroclear  where it reportedly generated around ‚Ç¨750 million in interest during the first quarter of the year.""We‚Äôve all faced the Euroclear and Clearstream problem. We believe that one of the Persian Gulf states could host the new financial depository  given the concentration of the capital in that region ‚Äù Kostin said  at the Bank of Russia Financial Congress in St. Petersburg.Euroclear settles securities trades on European exchanges and serves as a securities central depository for financial institutions operating in Europe. The company ceased transactions with Russia‚Äôs National Settlement Depository (NSD) and blocked NSD accounts within its system in line with sanctions against the Russian clearing house imposed in mid-2022. The move effectively made Russians unable to access their assets held within Euroclear. It has been estimated that Russian assets stuck at Euroclear amount to ‚Ç¨196.6 billion ($211.1 billion)  the vast majority of which is owned by the country‚Äôs central bank.Kostin also called for an alternative to SWIFT  the international financial messaging system. Russian banks were cut off SWIFT last year  which made it impossible for them to carry out transactions with foreign financial institutions.According to the banker  new tools to attract capital should also be developed.‚ÄúToday it‚Äôs mostly Eurobonds. The entire financial infrastructure is built in the West. We propose to create new instruments which would respond to the needs of national currency and market regulation ‚Äù Kostin explained. The new financial infrastructure will attract Western investors and companies  he added.Following the imposition of sanctions against it  Russia and its trading partners among developing nations have intensified efforts to reduce the use of the Western financial system and replace the US dollar and the euro with national currencies for settlements in trade. The trend is supported by the members of BRICS  the economic bloc uniting Brazil  Russia  India  China and South Africa  and many other nations who want to join the union. Among the currencies that have been used instead of the US dollar are the Russian ruble  Chinese yuan  and UAE dirham.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section",neutral,0.01,0.98,0.0,negative,0.0,0.15,0.85,True,English,"['EU clearing houses', 'Russia', 'alternative', 'international depository settlement hub', 'international financial messaging system', 'new securities depository exchange', 'EU securities transactions companies', 'securities central depository', 'National Settlement Depository', 'new financial depository', 'entire financial infrastructure', 'new financial infrastructure', 'foreign financial institutions', 'many other nations', 'largest bank VTB', 'Russian clearing house', 'Western financial system', 'Persian Gulf states', 'Russia Financial Congress', 'Central Bank assets', 'securities trades', 'new tools', 'new instruments', 'developing nations', 'national currency', 'Western investors', 'Russian assets', 'Russian banks', 'Russian ruble', 'first quarter', 'St. Petersburg', 'European exchanges', 'vast majority', 'market regulation', 'trading partners', 'US dollar', 'economic bloc', 'South Africa', 'Chinese yuan', 'UAE dirham', 'business section', 'national currencies', 'Western sanctions', 'top banker', 'NSD accounts', 'Andrey Kostin', 'Clearstream problem', 'Euroclear amount', 'alternative', 'CEO', 'Thursday', 'Belgium', 'Luxembourg', 'billions', 'Moscow', 'bulk', 'funds', 'interest', 'year', 'concentration', 'capital', 'region', 'company', 'line', 'mid-20', 'move', 'Russians', 'country', 'SWIFT', 'Eurobonds', 'needs', 'efforts', 'settlements', 'trend', 'members', 'BRICS', 'Brazil', 'India', 'China', 'union', 'stories', 'economy', 'finance']",2023-07-06,2023-07-07,rt.com

If you want to skip our analysis of the stock market  market indexes  and recent developments  head on over to 5 Best NASDAQ Stocks To Buy Today.The U.S. economy finally appears to be stabilizing. Throughout 2023  worries of a recession have plagued investor minds as many worried that the Federal Reserve had gone too far in its interest rate hikes. However  June dealt markets a nice surprise as the Commerce Department upgraded its estimates for the first quarter of 2023's GDP growth. This third revision showed that the economy had posted an annual growth rate of 2% in Q1 2023  up by 70 basis points (0.7%) from the previous estimates.This data came as two and a half days of trading were left before the 4th of July holiday  and after opening at 13 592 on the day of the release  the NASDAQ Composite index closed at 13 816 the day before the holiday to pocket a modest 1.6% growth. The effect of this release was also reflected in the currency markets  with the U.S. dollar tumbling against major currencies as investors readjusted their sentiments of potential interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.Crucially though  2023's first half has proven to be remarkable for the stock market. The NASDAQ Composite and NASDAQ 100 are up by 33% and 40% this year (its best first half performance in history) - quite different from what many investors were expecting heading into this year riding on the back of high interest rates and high inflation. The two NASDAQs are also among the best performing indexes this year  as the S&P500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average have gained 16.51% and 3.87%  respectively.The NASDAQ also ranks second on the list of the world's biggest stock exchanges. As of January 2023  the total market capitalization of all firms listed on it stood at $18 trillion - surpassed only by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) which had a market capitalization of $22 trillion. This value is greater than the world's third and fourth biggest stock exchanges  namely the Euronext N.V. exchanges and the Japan Exchange Group Exchanges.Yet  even as the stock market appears to be robust  the debate has already started about a bigger market - the bond market. The apparent simmering upshoots of negativity in the bond market came to the forefront on the same day that Commerce upgraded its GDP estimates. In an opinion piece  former New York Federal Reserve president Bill Dudley claimed that the yields on 10 year U.S. bonds will shoot up to 4.5% - up from the roughly 3.75% right now. He explained that due to the tight labor market  persistent inflation  and robust economy  the Fed might be forced to maintain high interest rates for longer. He also added that the Fed is also forced to ensure that inflation remains around 2% since if it falls too much then its utility to stimulate economic growth also falls. Finally  he factored in the reduced demand for U.S. government treasuries to indicate that the risk premium investors demand for these bonds will go up. Putting all these together  he arrived at a 4.5% yield estimate - and one that has generated quite a bit of controversy.Leading the charge against the former Fed official with years of experience in investment banking  are analysts from Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS). They believe that instead of the yields shooting up to 4.5% (which indicates a sharp decrease in the bond price and creates an incentive for existing bondholders to sell their instruments)  the yields will actually drop to 2% and 3% from the current 3.85%. They also countered the components of Mr. Dudley's 4.5% estimate  namely the one involving 1% short term interest rates. The Morgan Stanley analysts believe that short term rates can increase to a maximum 0.5%  with average inflation expected to sit at 2% instead of 2.5% over the long term as assumed by Dudley.But what if both stocks and bonds were headed for a downturn this year? Well  that's what's on the mind of the world's largest hedge fund Bridgewater Associate's co-chief investment officer Mr. Greg Jensen  who outlined in a recent podcast:My view is you end up with growth disappointing a bit and inflation disappointing on the high side a bit  ending up probably bad for bonds and probably a little bit bad for equities and generally weak growth. And if that weak growth starts to translate into a rising savings rate  you could easily end up in a recession and one that‚Äôs going to be difficult to deal with. I‚Äôve tamed and we‚Äôve tamed at Bridgewater  to some degree  our view on growth. While still negative  [IT'S] not as extreme as it appeared and it‚Äôs a more gradual process that‚Äôs unfolding.With these details in mind  let's take a look at some top NASDAQ stocks that might be interesting to look at. Out of these  the notable picks are DexCom  Inc. (NASDAQ:DXCM)  Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)  and WillScot Mobile Mini Holdings Corp.

However  this naturally biases the list in favor of mega cap stocks  leaving little utility to our list of top NASDAQ stocks. So  we filtered the list by including only those firms that were rated Hold or better. While choosing stocks rated Hold sounds counterintuitive  it provides a better contrast between analyst sentiment and hedge fund sentiment since some Hold stocks might have more investors than Buy stocks.

For too long they have had to rely upon large volume paracentesis  a therapy developed by the ancient Egyptians and with little improvement in the last two thousand years. This important patient population is forecast to grow strongly due to the increasing prevalence of NASHi / fatty liver disease  one of the key health challenges in North America today. We believe that the data recently presented at the EASL Liver meeting demonstrates the potential for alfapump to transform patient lives ‚Äì virtually eliminating needle paracentesis and delivering clinically important improvement in patient quality of life.‚ÄúWe look forward to submit our Pre-Market Approval to the US FDA later this year and are preparing for commercial launch of the alfapump in North America through our own specialty salesforce.‚ÄùA 63-year old alfapump patient from Canada said: ‚ÄúThe alfapump changed my life. I thought I was going to die. I got lucky with the alfapump  my daily routine is getting back  with no pain and suffering  just feeling good about taking care of myself. My approach to life totally changed since the alfapump. I look at it as a second chance in life.‚Äùa lfa pump ‚Äì continuous ascites removal to the bladderSequana Medical‚Äôs alfapump is a fully implantable  wirelessly charged device that continuously collects ascites as it forms in the abdominal cavity and moves it into the bladder  where it is naturally passed from the body through urination. Since the first alfapump was implanted at the end of 2008  there has been a steady increase in the number of patients benefiting from the improved quality of life that the alfapump brings. During that time  more than 100 000 liters of ascites have been removed safely with the alfapump.Strong clinical alfa pump profile demonstrated in pivotal POSEIDON studyHighlights from the Company‚Äôs flagship POSEIDON study  which met all primary endpoints  were recently presented at the EASL Liver meeting in Viennaii:alfa pump was effective in the control of ascites  virtually eliminating the need for large volume paracentesispump was effective in the control of ascites  virtually eliminating the need for large volume paracentesis Safety was in line with expectations  particularly given disease progression in these patients.

These patients can have up to 15 liters of extra fluid in their bodies  causing major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility that severely impacts daily life. Although diuretics are standard of care  the problem is that in many patients they are no longer effective and / or tolerable. There are limited effective treatment options for these patients  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing ‚Äúdiuretic-resistant‚Äù patient population.alfapump¬Æ and DSR¬Æ are Sequana Medical‚Äôs proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  delivering major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients and reducing costs for healthcare systems.

As global net-zero pledges ‚Ä¶,"DGB Group N.V. (""DGB"" or ""the Group"") (Euronext: DGB: NL0009169515)  a leading carbon project developer and ecosystem restoration company  projects a continuation of strong demand for high-quality carbon credits in the rapidly evolving voluntary carbon market. As global net-zero pledges increase  DGB expects a continued shift towards high-quality removal credits from nature-based solutions.Carbon credits allow organisations to reduce their emissions through offsets today while taking cost-effective action to reduce future emissions through sustainability in their business models. Carbon credits are thus an essential tool for businesses to achieve their decarbonisation goals.DGB is one of the fastest-growing project developers in the carbon marketplace and recognises the following trends in the market:Rising demand for carbon credits : The surging significance of carbon credits for attaining net-zero targets has led to an escalated demand  particularly for nature-based credits. Organisations such as JP Morgan  Microsoft  and Apple are investing substantially in high-quality carbon projects. This trend is reinforced by new guidance on carbon credit claims for net zero from the Voluntary Carbon Markets Integrity Initiative ("" VCMI "")  which enhances market transparency and could boost growth.: The surging significance of carbon credits for attaining net-zero targets has led to an escalated demand  particularly for nature-based credits. Organisations such as JP Morgan  Microsoft  and Apple are investing substantially in high-quality carbon projects. This trend is reinforced by new guidance on carbon credit claims for net zero from the Voluntary Carbon Markets Integrity Initiative ("" "")  which enhances market transparency and could boost growth. Preference for AR credits over REDD+ : By 2030  there is an expected shift towards high-quality  verifiable afforestation/reforestation (AR) credits. DGB acknowledges that both avoidance and removal credits are pivotal for achieving global climate goals. Still  it anticipates greater demand for AR removal credits due to their quality and verifiability  thus phasing out the reliance on REDD+.: By 2030  there is an expected shift towards high-quality  verifiable afforestation/reforestation (AR) credits. DGB acknowledges that both avoidance and removal credits are pivotal for achieving global climate goals. Still  it anticipates greater demand for AR removal credits due to their quality and verifiability  thus phasing out the reliance on REDD+. Adoption of Article 6 of the Paris Agreement : For project developers and buyers  it's becoming increasingly essential to consider Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. In fact  the implementation of Article 6.2 is now often seen as a prerequisite by buyers. Article 6.2 of the agreement facilitates countries to trade Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOs)  which are essentially emission reductions and removals  through bilateral or multilateral agreements. This provision creates a more interconnected global carbon market  promoting more efficient and widespread emission reduction efforts.: For project developers and buyers  it's becoming increasingly essential to consider Article 6 of the Paris Agreement.

This provision creates a more interconnected global carbon market  promoting more efficient and widespread emission reduction efforts. Enhanced regulation and monitoring : Organisations like the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and the VCMI are progressively impacting the growth and shaping the trends of the market. The role of a credible Monitoring  Reporting  and Verification (MRV) framework is gaining importance in credit-purchase decisions to ensure the measurable impact of purchased credits.: Organisations like the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and the VCMI are progressively impacting the growth and shaping the trends of the market. The role of a credible Monitoring  Reporting  and Verification (MRV) framework is gaining importance in credit-purchase decisions to ensure the measurable impact of purchased credits. Growing emphasis on nature projects and tree planting : Nature-based solutions  including tree planting  are increasingly considered essential for corporate net-zero strategies. A prominent example is AstraZeneca's AZ Forest initiative  which commits to planting and maintaining 200 million trees worldwide by 2030.The outlook for the carbon market remains robust and promising  based on projections from various prominent institutions. The range of price estimates is wide  with the voluntary carbon market projected to grow to anywhere between $10 billion and $100 billion by 2030. This significant growth trend is primarily fueled by the rising number of companies setting net-zero targets and the surge in demand for carbon credits  which are central to offsetting carbon footprints.EY  McKinsey  and BCG  alongside Morgan Stanley  all anticipate a multi-fold expansion  suggesting a market value ranging from $30 billion to $50 billion by 2030. The more optimistic outlooks from Goldman Sachs and Wood Mackenzie forecast a market size of $100 billion by 2030  indicating potential for exponential growth if the right conditions and commitments persist. A conservative projection comes from PwC  estimating the growth of up to $30 billion by the same year-still a 10-fold growth compared to today's $3 billion market. The consensus across all price predictions is the rapid and substantial growth of the market  marking it as a promising long-term investment opportunity.DGB likewise sees a positive outlook for the carbon credit market as demand for high-quality credits increases. DGB foresees a significant price increment towards 2030 due to a shortage of carbon credits from removal projects. DGB predicts that the volume of credits required globally will increase at least 20-fold by 2035  with prices rising to a central estimate of $80-$150 per tonne by 2035. It forecasts a verified emissions reduction-price rise of 9.5% to 15.0% per year towards 2035 and a 4.0% to 6.0% price increase from 2035 to 2050.ConclusionDGB underscores the monumental role of high-quality carbon credits in realising a sustainable future. Not only do they serve as an integral tool for achieving net-zero targets  they also stimulate economic growth  facilitate ecosystem restoration  and aid in biodiversity conservation. High-quality credits help to bridge the gap between current emissions and future reduction goals  enabling immediate  measurable impact.'We see the escalating demand  underscored by increasing corporate net-zero commitments and regulatory support  as a clear indicator of the sector's growth trajectory. Despite occasional price volatility  the significant investments by major corporations reflect confidence in the robustness and long-term sustainability of this market'  said Selwyn Duijvestijn  CEO of DGB. Duijvestijn added  'This burgeoning carbon market holds the promise of an unprecedented investment opportunity. DGB stands at the forefront of this rapidly evolving market. With the dual advantage of attractive returns and positive environmental impact  investing in the carbon credit market can be a game-changer in the world's quest for sustainability. There is a remarkable potential of high-quality carbon credits as an indispensable part of the decarbonisation toolkit.'For further insights on DGB's performance during Q2 of 2023. please refer to DGB's quarterly update which was released today.DGB GROUP NVpress@dgb.earth+31108080126www.green.earthDGB is a project developer of high-quality  large-scale carbon and biodiversity projects accredited by third parties.

During this time  the Group made significant strides in strengthening its financial position‚Ä¶,"DGB Group N.V. (""DGB"" or ""the Group"") (Euronext: DGB: NL0009169515)  a leading carbon project developer and ecosystem restoration company  provides an update on its performance during Q2 of 2023. During this time  the Group made significant strides in strengthening its financial position and advancing its project pipeline.DGB is a project developer of nature-based projects that originate high-integrity carbon credits known as Verified Emission Reduction Carbon Credits (""Carbon Credits""). Carbon Credits are also commonly known as carbon offsets  and each Carbon Credit equals one tonne of verified emissions reduction. Carbon reduction markets are rapidly expanding  and there is universal consensus from governments and corporations that the market needs to grow to match global net-zero needs.Throughout Q2 of 2023  DGB persistently strived to enhance global partnerships with governments and organisations to develop impactful Carbon Credit projects. These collaborations aim to provide sustainable benefits to local communities while conserving biodiversity. Some key milestones of the quarter include:DGB's flagship large-scale 44 255-hectare AR carbon project in Cameroon is progressing with the validation by an external auditor for certification with Verra.DGB's large-scale 27 800-hectare AR carbon project in Kenya is further advancing and also undergoing validation by an external auditor for certification with Verra  while continuing to plant trees with farmers.The Hongera Energy Efficient Cookstoves Project is on track to produce and distribute 75 000 cookstoves in 2023 (out of the project's total 150 000).The Bulindi Chimpanzee Habitat Restoration Project (Uganda AR) has started planting and is scheduled to start validation with an external auditor in Q3 of 2023.The cookstove project in Cameroon is currently undergoing technical design testing  assessing localisation needs from the base Hongera design.The commencement of an additional cookstove project in Kenya  targeting schools and other educational institutions  is undergoing a feasibility study and technical testing of the units already installed.The feasibility study of DGB's biochar project in Uganda is progressing  and DGB is performing technical testing on potentially integrating biochar projects into its other existing project footprints (in Kenya and Cameroon).Following the execution of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with AGRO-MAP and the Republic of C√¥te d'Ivoire  DGB expects to finalise the feasibility study in Q3 and commence project activities.The initiation of pre-feasibility studies for Carbon Credit projects in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)  Kazakhstan  and Mozambique is also progressing.DGB now has 7 large-scale projects under development and management. The operational team is conducting feasibility studies on 10 more projects. Projects need two to six years of financing before they start to originate Carbon Credits. The current project pipeline consists of 40 million tonnes of Carbon Credits.In 2022  DGB demonstrated its expertise in developing and overseeing substantial carbon and biodiversity initiatives. DGB currently manages seven large-scale projects structured according to high-ranking verification standards. A surge of ‚Ç¨21.45 million in DGB's project value has led to an aggregate asset worth of ‚Ç¨27.66 million  as reported in the annual report and position paper on valuation  published in Q2.A successful new green bond issuance in the second quarter has driven further expansion of DGB's projects since. Additionally  DGB generated a cash flow totalling ‚Ç¨720 000 from the (forward) sales of Carbon Credits during the same period.Negotiations and project due diligence on large forward carbon credit purchases proceeded unabated. DGB's CEO  Selwyn Duijvestijn  emphasised the strong purchase interest expressed by (commodity) trading houses and corporations:'We have initiated dialogues with most of the trading houses and discovered that larger corporations with net zero pledges are providing more favourable terms  offering extended contract durations  and are proving to be the most supportive on the buying front for now. The competitive landscape has intensified as other buyers recognise our ability to develop large-scale projects independently.'Duijvestijn drew attention to the high interest buyers show in reforestation and ecosystem restoration projects  with restoration efforts currently outpacing conservation projects:'Buyers demonstrate an increasing preference for carbon removal projects. They seek projects that contribute to the wellbeing of the community  ecosystem restoration and bolster biodiversity. These combined factors have allowed us to offer significant premiums on our projects.'He further added that DGB's projects would secure price premiums on its contracts because these projects have extensive scale-implementation potential.DGB's financial outlook is based on current project documentation  Carbon Credit generation projections  and market transactions. In 2023  the Group aims to:Further expand its project pipeline from 40 million to 100 million tonnes of Carbon Credits.Increase (forward) sales of Carbon Credits. The Group expects to close (forward) sales for minimally 5 million Carbon Credits in the second half of 2023.Launch its platform for biodiversity credits and sell the first tailor-made biodiversity credits.For further insights on the market trends and role of high-quality carbon credits in the global shift towards decarbonisation  please refer to our quarterly market outlook  which was released today.DGB GROUP NVpress@dgb.earth+31108080126DGB is a project developer of high-quality  large-scale carbon and biodiversity projects accredited by third parties.

These transformation projects cover all formats developed by Carrefour  including hypermarkets  supermarkets and convenience stores  and respond to societal changes with a focus on achieving three key ambitions:- Continue to integrate Carrefour centers into neighbourhoods redeveloped in consultation with elected representatives and local authorities- Develop schemes adapted to their surroundings by integrating mixed-used programmes into existing land-take sites- Support the ecological urban transition by creating new green spaces and promoting local non-mechanised forms of transportThis long-term partnership will enable Carrefour and Nexity to develop mixed-used programmes with high environmental performance for housing  serviced residences  retail outlets  offices and hotels. Forty city-centre sites will be fully redeveloped  with the reintegration of a food sales area. The other thirty-six sites  located on the outskirts of towns and cities or in commercial areas  relate to existing parking spaces which will be reassigned to urban projects. The seventy-six sites cover approximately 800 000 sq.m. of land  and their development will lead to the creation of 12 000 homes  120 000 sq.m. of retail space  with the reconstruction of selected stores  10 000 sq.m. of office space and businesses and 17 000 sq.m. of hotels.The property venture  known as a ‚Äúv√©hicule de portage foncier‚Äù  which is expected to be up and running by the first quarter of 2024 at the latest  will be 80% owned by Carrefour and 20% by Nexity.Alexandre Bompard  CEO of the Carrefour Group says: ‚ÄúThis ambitious urban redevelopment programme will enable us to fully realise the value of our property portfolio and our assets to recreate a more vibrant  diverse urban fabric around our commercial areas. Thanks to our partnership with Nexity  we will benefit from the expertise of a leading group in the sector and urban mixed developments. The project also reflects our commitment to the ecological transition  helping us to make the best possible use of our footprint and to limit land take.V√©ronique B√©dague  CEO of Nexity says: ‚ÄúI am delighted to have signed this long-term partnership with Carrefour  which is fully in line with our joint 2026 strategic plans. For Nexity  it is an opportunity to implement a transformative and exemplary approach to urban regeneration and to rise to the challenges of urban sprawl and the energy transition. To achieve very high environmental performance (2028 or 2031 thresholds under RE2020 [France‚Äôs environmental regulations on new builds])  we can rely on our leadership in construction process industrialisation to shorten construction times and reduce environmental nuisance. Lastly  for Nexity  it is a way of continuing to offer our fellow citizens all types of housing as part of the residential path we are building.‚ÄùAbout CarrefourWith a multi-format network of over 14 000 stores in 43 countries  the Carrefour Group is one of the world's leading food retailers.

The expected increased Q4 FY23 revenue growth of +12-15% on a like-for-like (LFL) basis  up from its previous outlook for +10% growth  is fuelled by strong momentum in Prestige and the recovery in the China market.

27436,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://wwd.com/beauty-industry-news/beauty-features/coty-raises-fourth-quarter-full-year-2023-guidance-1235727396/,Coty Raises Q4  Fiscal Year 2023 Guidance,The company  which is considering a dual Paris-New York listing  held its first investor conference in the French capital.,PARIS ‚Äî As Coty Inc. explores a possible second stock market listing  in Paris  the company on Thursday hosted its first investor conference in the French capital.The meeting  which took place in a room at the H√¥tel du Louvre decorated with vintage Coty perfume posters  was notably ‚Äî and symbolically ‚Äî held in French. That began not long after Coty revealed in a release that it has raised guidance for the fourth quarter and full fiscal-year 2023.The group now expects 12 percent to 15 percent like-for-like sales growth for the three months ended June 30  and 10 percent to 11 percent like-for-like sales gains for the full fiscal year.Coty has also  for the third time this year  increased its profit outlook for fiscal 2023  when it now expects to reach adjusted EBITDA of $965 million to $970 million  against the former guidance of $955 million to $965 million  despite incurring close to $70 million in negative currency-exchange impacts. That will include more than $10 million in the fourth quarter.During the conference  Sue Nabi  chief executive officer of Coty  detailed how the company is leveraging its European heritage and end-to-end capabilities to achieve strong and balanced growth. She shined a light  as well  on certain product categories  geographic zones and retail channels that will help bolster business  including ultra-premium skin care and scenting  plus China  Brazil and travel retail.Nabi fielded questions from journalists.After one  she confirmed that Coty remains in a purely exploratory phase when it comes to a listing on the Euronext Paris exchange. The CEO explained such a move would make good sense for numerous reasons  including the fact Coty was born in Paris.‚ÄúFinancial investors on the European market are probably very impassioned by beauty and luxury ‚Äù both categories that Coty is in  she continued  adding a dual listing  including the current one in New York  could enrich the firm‚Äôs investor base.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs quite natural ‚Äù said Nabi  of the possible listing  but emphasized it is too early to confirm whether it will happen or any details if it does.The subject of the Gucci fragrance and beauty license was raised  as it‚Äôs long been speculated that Kering would like to take the business in-house.It has been estimated that the long-term license with the Italian luxury group is due to expire in 2028. Nabi didn‚Äôt mention a specific date  but reiterated that none of the licenses Coty has are due to expire within the next five years. She also highlighted the balanced growth among the company‚Äôs brands  both licensed and owned.‚ÄúNone of Coty‚Äôs brands represents more than 10 percent of [overall] sales ‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúAnd it will probably go even more in this direction.‚Äù That is  as brands  particularly in categories such as skin care and premium fragrance  grow.So whatever scenario vis-√†-vis Gucci  Nabi said: ‚ÄúIt will have no impact on the growth algorithm of the Coty group.‚ÄùGucci Alchemist GardenWhen asked about the evolution of the U.S. market  the executive said: ‚ÄúIn the U.S.  we do not see a slowdown in the markets in which we operate.‚ÄùThat is to say  primarily in the prestige fragrance and makeup categories.Regarding whether acquisitions of new licenses or brands are in the offing  Nabi said that during the next two years  as the company‚Äôs turnaround continues  Coty will be obsessed with what it has ‚Äî a portfolio of brands that can stretch into other categories ‚Äî and build up brands‚Äô marketing and equity.‚ÄúWe‚Äôve revitalized all our brands ‚Äù she said.Meanwhile  Coty continues to pay down debt  and when it equals two-times EBITDA  Nabi said that‚Äôs when the company can ask itself: ‚ÄúDid we win all our bets  or not? What are those that would require a new brand or license?‚ÄùShe emphasized Coty has deep roots in Europe  with its Franco-American heritage  and said the company has made significant strides over the past few years with a strategy driven by numerous motors of growth  which have greatly improved the group‚Äôs financial standing.Its six strategic pillars include: stabilizing and growing consumer beauty makeup brands and fragrances; accelerating luxury fragrance to become a key player in prestige makeup; building the skin care portfolio across both the consumer beauty and prestige divisions; building e-commerce and direct-to-consumer expertise and capabilities; expanding in China and travel retail  led by prestige brands  and becoming a beauty leader in sustainability.Coty sees significant white space in China  which rings up an estimated 13 percent of beauty sales worldwide and 4 percent of the group‚Äôs sales overall. The country is swiftly becoming a major fragrance market. Sales of prestige perfumes there are up 66 percent versus three years ago and growing 1.5-times faster than China‚Äôs prestige beauty segment.Coty‚Äôs ambition is to more than double its sales in the country to more than $600 million by fiscal-year 2026.Travel retail is another white space for the group. It generates 8 percent of Coty‚Äôs sales  versus about 10 percent of the beauty industry‚Äôs total. The company has gained significant market share in the channel in major geographic zones  including 90 basis points in the Americas  180 basis points in the Europe  Middle East and Africa zone and 44 basis points in the Asia Pacific region in calendar year 2022 versus 2021.Coty aims to increase its travel-retail sales by about 50 percent to more than $600 million by fiscal-year 2026.According to McKinsey & Company  the global beauty market generated $427 billion in 2022  with an estimated 6 percent compound annual growth rate expected between 2022 and 2027. That compares with $66 billion and about 8 percent CAGR for beauty in China  and $47 billion and about 11 percent CAGR for beauty in travel retail.As Coty continues homing in on key beauty growth areas  such as prestige skin care  its revenue mix by category is expected to change.In fiscal 2023 year-to-date  prestige fragrances make up 56 percent  consumer beauty cosmetics 24 percent and body care 7 percent of overall company sales. The goal for those categories by fiscal-year 2026 is to have them grow by low 50-something percent  low 20-something percent and high single-digits  respectively.Coty today owns 26 percent of hair care giant Wella  and considers the investment to be a financial asset worth about $1 billion.Coty plans to sell its stake in Wella between now and 2025  according to Laurent Mercier  the group‚Äôs chief financial officer.The company maintained its mid-term guidance of sales CAGR to be in the upper end of the 6 percent to 8 percent range through fiscal-year 2026 and beyond.,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.46,0.2,0.33,True,English,"['Fiscal Year', 'Coty', 'Guidance', 'possible second stock market listing', 'H√¥tel du Louvre', 'vintage Coty perfume posters', 'consumer beauty makeup brands', 'negative currency-exchange impacts', 'six strategic pillars', 'major fragrance market', 'next five years', 'next two years', 'ultra-premium skin care', 'U.S. market', 'chief executive officer', 'Gucci Alchemist Garden', 'first investor conference', 'full fiscal year', 'Euronext Paris exchange', 'significant white space', 'prestige beauty segment', 'skin care portfolio', 'Italian luxury group', 'possible listing', 'European market', 'prestige makeup', 'consumer expertise', 'dual listing', 'investor base', 'significant strides', 'prestige fragrance', 'makeup categories', 'beauty leader', 'beauty industry', 'Gucci fragrance', 'premium fragrance', 'luxury fragrance', 'prestige divisions', 'prestige perfumes', 'fourth quarter', 'full fiscal-year', 'three months', 'third time', 'profit outlook', 'European heritage', 'geographic zones', 'retail channels', 'travel retail', 'exploratory phase', 'good sense', 'numerous reasons', 'Financial investors', 'current one', 'New York', 'specific date', 'new brand', 'deep roots', 'Franco-American heritage', 'numerous motors', 'financial standing', 'key player', 'The comp', 'beauty license', 'balanced growth', 'growth algorithm', 'beauty sales', 'prestige brands', 'long-term license', 'product categories', 'other categories', 'brands‚Äô marketing', 'French capital', 'sales gains', 'former guidance', 'end capabilities', 'overall] sales', 'new licenses', 'two-times EBITDA', 'sales growth', 'Coty Inc.', 'Sue Nabi', '12 percent to', 'Coty group', '15 percent', '10 percent', '11 percent', '13 percent', '4 percent', '8 percent', 'company', 'Thursday', 'meeting', 'place', 'room', 'release', 'strong', 'light', 'business', 'scenting', 'China', 'Brazil', 'questions', 'journalists', 'CEO', 'move', 'fact', 'firm', 'details', 'subject', 'Kering', 'house', 'none', 'direction', 'scenario', 'evolution', 'slowdown', 'markets', 'acquisitions', 'offing', 'turnaround', 'equity', 'debt', 'bets', 'past', 'strategy', 'fragrances', 'commerce', 'sustainability', 'country', 'ambition', 'total']",2023-07-06,2023-07-07,wwd.com

(‚ÄúStellantis‚Äù) and NioCorp Developments Ltd. (‚ÄúNioCorp‚Äù or the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù) (Nasdaq:NB) (TSX:NB) today announced the signing of a Rare Earth Offtake Term Sheet (‚ÄúTerm Sheet‚Äù). The objective is to enter into a definitive rare earth supply agreement to support Stellantis‚Äô commitment to build resilient supply chains and reach carbon net zero by 2038 and to help accelerate NioCorp‚Äôs path to commercial production of magnetic rare earth oxides in the U.S.The Term Sheet executed today envisions a definitive agreement for a 10-year offtake contract for specific amounts of neodymium-praseodymium oxide  dysprosium oxide  and terbium oxide that NioCorp aims to produce at its Elk Creek Critical Minerals Project (the ‚ÄúElk Creek Project‚Äù) in southeast Nebraska  subject to the receipt of adequate project financing. Final volumes would be set in a definitive agreement.‚ÄúStellantis intends to lead the industry with the commitment to be carbon net zero by 2038 ‚Äì a goal that requires innovation and a complete redefinition of our sourcing strategies ‚Äù said Stellantis Chief Purchasing and Supply Chain Officer Maxime Picat. ‚ÄúBy working with partners like NioCorp  we are taking important steps  with the aim of decarbonizing mobility and ensuring strategic supplies of raw materials necessary for the success of the Company‚Äôs global electrification plans highlighted in our Dare Forward 2030 strategy.‚Äù‚ÄúWe are very pleased to announce that NioCorp and Stellantis have agreed to collaboratively develop Stellantis‚Äô magnetic rare earth supply chain  including helping to identify a sintered rare earth permanent magnet manufacturer that provides additional geographic optionality to Stellantis  in support of their ambitious commitment to reach carbon net zero by 2038 ‚Äù said Mark Smith  Executive Chairman and CEO of NioCorp. ‚ÄúWe believe that NioCorp‚Äôs position as a potential U.S. supplier of multiple critical minerals needed for vehicle electrification offers Stellantis important optionality to secure supply chains and support its growth targets.‚ÄùAs no economic analysis has been completed on the rare earth mineral resource comprising the Elk Creek Project  further studies are required before determining whether extraction of rare earth elements can be reasonably justified and is economically viable after taking account of all relevant factors.The entrance into a binding off-take agreement is subject to the satisfactory completion of due diligence  the negotiation and settlement of final terms  the negotiation of definitive documentation  and customary closing conditions  including regulatory approvals.

Other members include Michael Smurfit and Michael Smurfit jnr; Hilary O‚ÄôMeara  the managing director of Accenture; and David Widger  head of A&L Goodbody‚Äôs corporate department. According to the business school‚Äôs website  the advisory board is ‚Äúa well-established feature of our governance‚Äù  and draws on ‚Äúthe support and collaboration of many exceptional business leaders who bring their collective knowledge  commitment and insight to help us deliver our academic and other goals‚Äù.Forbes‚Äôs continued membership of the board might be a little awkward. That‚Äôs because two leading UCD professors ‚Äì Niamh Brennan and Dr Margaret Cullen ‚Äì have been commissioned by the government to review corporate governance at RT√â. They‚Äôll be checking whether failures or weaknesses in RT√â‚Äôs culture led to the payment of secret top-ups and the public understatement of earnings between 2017 and 2022. Checking Forbes‚Äôs homework  in other words.A spokeswoman for the Smurfit Business School confirmed Forbes was still on the advisory board  and would not offer further comment.RT√â Player reaches for Sky viewersDue to the top-up scandal  RT√â has had to hold back on issuing a press release about a positive development: the launch on June 27th of the RT√â Player app on Sky Q  one of the most popular TV platforms in Ireland. Sky customers are now offered it before Netflix  Amazon  Apple  Spotify or other rival apps  which should drive more viewers to the Player. In fairness  RT√â has sorted out most of the glitches with its digital service  and streams are up 20 per cent this year  with time spent viewing up 50 per cent.READ MOREIncidentally  I‚Äôm told there‚Äôs no payment to Sky from RT√â in return for the Player‚Äôs premier positioning on the platform.

Photograph: Yui Mok/PA WirePaddy McKillen snr has been appointed honorary consul for Vietnam  a country in which he has invested for 30 years  most notably in road construction but also a biotechnology campus in Hanoi. The official announcement will point out that this is the first time Vietnam has ever had an official representative in Dublin  since diplomatic relations have been handled via its embassy in London.Two years ago  McKillen told the Financial Times that he had been inspired by the Viet Cong in his refurbishment of Claridge‚Äôs in London. The developer wanted to double the size of the hotel while keeping it open  which engineers insisted was impossible. ‚ÄúI went down the Cu Chi tunnels in Vietnam  outside Saigon  dug by hand with spoons ‚Äù McKillen said. ‚ÄúThey built hospitals and schools down there  and that‚Äôs how they defeated the Americans ‚Äì with this network of tunnels. I came back and said  ‚ÄòAre you saying we don‚Äôt have the technology today to do the same under Claridge‚Äôs? Of course we have  we must have.‚Äô‚ÄùHis office as honorary consul is to be at 6 St Stephen‚Äôs Green in Dublin.Business Post Group liberated by Swedish investment‚ÄúWe are no longer prisoners of geography on our little North Atlantic island. We are liberated by technology and the power of AI ‚Äù businessman and round-the-world sailor Enda O‚ÄôCoineen told staff at the Business Post on Tuesday after the conclusion of exhaustive talks with the Swedish publishing group Bonnier News  which has taken a strategic minority investment in the Business Post Group. The protracted process should ensure the future of the newspaper  with the expectation being that a company as big as Bonnier  which had a turnover of ‚Ç¨762 million last year  is unlikely to remain a minority shareholder to Kilcullen Kapital forever.O‚ÄôCoineen can expect a nice pay-day whenever he exits the Business Post  having almost tripled the group‚Äôs turnover  from ‚Ç¨7.5 million to ‚Ç¨22 million  since taking over in September 2018. While the newspaper is modestly profitable  as is the group‚Äôs conference company iQuest  the star performer is the polling company Red C Research.Bonnier already has a media presence in Ireland  having launched a book publishing imprint  Eriu  under the directorship of Deirdre Nolan last year. Among the titles it will be publishing this autumn are Born to be a Footballer  the autobiography of Liam Brady; We need to Talk by Dr Tony Holohan  the former chief medical officer; and Cocaine Cowboys  the first of two books it has commissioned from journalist Nicola Tallant.NTMA and bonusesThe National Treasury Management Agency made performance-related payments to 239 employees last year  totalling ‚Ç¨2.24 million. The highest individual bonus was ‚Ç¨30 000. One of those who didn‚Äôt benefit was the former chief executive Conor O‚ÄôKelly  whose term expired in June.What a difference 20 years makes. In 2003  the chief executive of the NTMA was Michael Somers  and he received a bonus of ‚Ç¨303 000  or 69.6 per cent of his salary. In 2008  his second-last year in the job  Somers was paid ‚Ç¨565 000 and a bonus of ‚Ç¨403 000. Still  being chief executive of the NTMA is a good deal less onerous these days. With the economy awash with cash  Ireland will need to borrow much less on international markets over the coming years.Not that the culture of high pay has been entirely banished from the agency. According to its annual report  some 23 officials earned salaries of ‚Ç¨200 000 or more last year  maintaining its reputation as the best remunerated precinct of the Irish public service.Euronext‚Äôs plea on share trading stamp dutyEuronext Dublin chief executive Daryl Byrne. Photograph: Dara Mac D√≥naillEuronext Dublin  as the Irish stock exchange is now known  warned the Department of Finance at a meeting on March 15th that it was ‚Äúunlikely to keep three listings‚Äù of companies. Minutes of the meeting  which I obtained under the Freedom of Information Act  show that chief executive Daryl Byrne and Gillian Leeson  the exchange‚Äôs head of regulatory affairs  told civil servants that companies were potentially going to remove their secondary listing from Dublin ‚Äúso they can move to the US‚Äù. While the companies are not named  we presume the reference was to CRH  Flutter and Diageo  which announced on April 13th that it was cancelling its Dublin listing. The drinks company left the exchange on May 30th.The dire consequences of CRH‚Äôs and Flutter‚Äôs departures had been spelt out in a warning letter to Minister for Finance Michael McGrath on March 3rd  in which Euronext appealed for help in keeping them. ‚ÄúThe importance of equity capital markets as a funding mechanism for Irish companies was best demonstrated in 2020  during the pandemic  when Irish-listed companies raised over ‚Ç¨4.2 billion from shareholders in secondary fundraising ‚Äù Byrne argued.Underlining the importance of Flutter and CRH  Byrne estimated they generated more than 60 per cent of the total stamp duty on trading in shares of Irish companies  worth ‚Ç¨250 million-‚Ç¨300 million to the exchequer.So far the Department of Finance has taken no action. Euronext‚Äôs hope must be that McGrath will announce in the budget that the 1 per cent tax on share purchases is being halved.,negative,0.0,0.01,0.99,mixed,0.23,0.11,0.66,True,English,"['Dee Forbes‚Äô position', 'Smurfit Business School', 'advisory board', 'UCD', 'former chief executive Conor O‚ÄôKelly', 'The National Treasury Management Agency', 'former chief medical officer', 'little North Atlantic island', 'many exceptional business leaders', 'two leading UCD professors', 'former director general', 'Hilary O‚ÄôMeara', 'A&L Goodbody', 'Dr Margaret Cullen', 'popular TV platforms', 'Yui Mok/PA Wire', 'Enda O‚ÄôCoineen', 'Red C Research', 'book publishing imprint', 'Dr Tony Holohan', 'journalist Nicola Tallant', 'other rival apps', 'Smurfit Business School', 'Michael Smurfit jnr', 'Cu Chi tunnels', 'strategic minority investment', 'highest individual bonus', 'Swedish publishing group', 'Business Post Group', 'Irish advisory board', 'Paddy McKillen snr', 'RT√â Player app', 'little something', 'Swedish investment', 'two books', 'managing director', 'minority shareholder', 'Michael Somers', 'Other members', 'other goals', 'other words', 'standing member', 'David Widger', 'corporate department', 'collective knowledge', 'continued membership', 'Niamh Brennan', 'secret top-ups', 'public understatement', 'top-up scandal', 'press release', 'positive development', 'digital service', 'premier positioning', 'barter accounts', 'honorary consul', 'Financial Times', 'Viet Cong', 'road construction', 'biotechnology campus', 'official announcement', 'official representative', 'diplomatic relations', '6 St Stephen', 'exhaustive talks', 'Kilcullen Kapital', 'nice pay-day', 'star performer', 'media presence', 'Deirdre Nolan', 'Liam Brady', 'Cocaine Cowboys', 'performance-related payments', 'Sky Q', 'Sky customers', 'conference company', 'polling company', 'corporate governance', 'first time', 'Bonnier News', 'Dee Forbes', 'Sky viewers', 'Accenture', 'head', 'website', 'feature', 'support', 'collaboration', 'commitment', 'insight', 'academic', 'government', 'failures', 'weaknesses', 'culture', 'earnings', 'homework', 'spokeswoman', 'comment', 'launch', 'June', 'Ireland', 'Netflix', 'Amazon', 'Apple', 'Spotify', 'fairness', 'glitches', 'streams', 'READ', 'return', 'Vietnam', 'refurbishment', 'Claridge', 'London', 'Photograph', 'country', '30 years', 'Hanoi', 'Dublin', 'embassy', 'developer', 'size', 'hotel', 'engineers', 'Saigon', 'hand', 'spoons', 'hospitals', 'schools', 'Americans', 'network', 'Green', 'prisoners', 'geography', 'power', 'businessman', 'world', 'sailor', 'staff', 'Tuesday', 'conclusion', 'process', 'future', 'newspaper', 'expectation', 'turnover', 'September', 'iQuest', 'Eriu', 'directorship', 'titles', 'autumn', 'Footballer', 'autobiography', 'NTMA', 'bonuses', '239 employees', 'term', 'difference']",2023-07-07,2023-07-07,irishtimes.com

Lagarde has said high inflation remains a persistent problem in the 20 countries that make up the euro currency zone.In Italy  Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni last week blasted the ECB for steadily raising interest rates  calling the policy ""simplistic"" and ""likely to do more harm than good."" The fear in Italy is that higher interest rates will act as a drag on economic growth and impact countries' fragile economic recoveries.Meloni was not the only European leader to criticize the ECB rate hike plan  though she was the most vocal about it.On Thursday  selling early in the session gained momentum throughout the day.By the time of the closing bell  the main index on the Italian Stock Exchange in Milan was down 2.5 percent; in Frankfurt  blue chips were down 2.6 percent; in Paris 3.1 percent; in Madrid by 2.1 percent; and in Amsterdam  the main index was down 2.2 percent.Broad indexes were also lower  with the Euronext 100 losing 2.8 percent of its value and the Stoxx Europe 600 falling 2.3 percent. Even Euronext  the holding company that runs seven European stock exchanges  suffered losses  with its shares falling 4.4 percent  their biggest one-day decline since September.The euro currency  meanwhile  gained against the U.S. dollar Thursday as the likelihood of higher interest rates in Europe attracted the attention of currency traders.The ECB raised interest rates for the eighth consecutive meeting in June  bringing them to their highest level in 22 years. The ECB is trying to bring inflation down to its target of 2 percent  though its models indicate that will not happen until 2025.Preliminary figures show the eurozone's year-on-year inflation rate in June was 5.5 percent  down from 6.1 percent a month earlier.Inflation in Europe started surging last year  fueled by record-high energy prices  which in turn were triggered by the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. While energy prices have stabilized in recent months  inflation has remained stubbornly high due to persistently high prices in some sectors  including food production and transportation.The next meeting of the ECB is scheduled to take place on July 27 in Frankfurt.",negative,0.02,0.45,0.53,negative,0.0,0.07,0.93,True,English,"['ECB interest rate hikes', 'European stocks retreat', 'worries', 'U.S. Federal Reserve', 'Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni', 'major European stock exchanges', 'seven European stock exchanges', 'ECB rate hike plan', 'ECB chief Christine Lagarde', 'U.S. dollar', 'Italian Stock Exchange', 'biggest one-day decline', 'fragile economic recoveries', 'European Central Bank', 'eighth consecutive meeting', 'record-high energy prices', 'higher interest rates', 'aggressive monetary policy', 'year inflation rate', 'euro currency zone', 'European leader', 'rate hikes', 'economic growth', 'high prices', 'currency traders', 'investor worries', 'blue-chip indexes', 'other currencies', 'recent weeks', 'persistent problem', 'closing bell', 'main index', 'blue chips', 'Broad indexes', 'holding company', 'The ECB', 'highest level', 'Preliminary figures', 'recent months', 'food production', 'next meeting', 'high inflation', 'Stoxx Europe', 'Europe countries', '20 countries', 'ROME', 'Xinhua', 'Thursday', 'sell', 'off', 'steam', 'session', '2 percent', 'prospect', 'July', 'pleas', 'leaders', 'Italy', 'harm', 'fear', 'drag', 'momentum', 'time', 'Milan', 'Frankfurt', 'Paris', 'Madrid', '2.1 percent', 'Amsterdam', 'Euronext', '2.8 percent', 'value', 'losses', 'shares', 'September', 'likelihood', 'attention', 'June', '22 years', 'target', 'models', 'eurozone', '5.5 percent', '6.1 percent', 'turn', 'conflict', 'Russia', 'Ukraine', 'sectors', 'transportation', 'place', '3.1']",2023-07-07,2023-07-07,thestar.com.my
