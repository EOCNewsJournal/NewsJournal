Other members include Michael Smurfit and Michael Smurfit jnr; Hilary O’Meara  the managing director of Accenture; and David Widger  head of A&L Goodbody’s corporate department. According to the business school’s website  the advisory board is “a well-established feature of our governance”  and draws on “the support and collaboration of many exceptional business leaders who bring their collective knowledge  commitment and insight to help us deliver our academic and other goals”.Forbes’s continued membership of the board might be a little awkward. That’s because two leading UCD professors – Niamh Brennan and Dr Margaret Cullen – have been commissioned by the government to review corporate governance at RTÉ. They’ll be checking whether failures or weaknesses in RTÉ’s culture led to the payment of secret top-ups and the public understatement of earnings between 2017 and 2022. Checking Forbes’s homework  in other words.A spokeswoman for the Smurfit Business School confirmed Forbes was still on the advisory board  and would not offer further comment.RTÉ Player reaches for Sky viewersDue to the top-up scandal  RTÉ has had to hold back on issuing a press release about a positive development: the launch on June 27th of the RTÉ Player app on Sky Q  one of the most popular TV platforms in Ireland. Sky customers are now offered it before Netflix  Amazon  Apple  Spotify or other rival apps  which should drive more viewers to the Player. In fairness  RTÉ has sorted out most of the glitches with its digital service  and streams are up 20 per cent this year  with time spent viewing up 50 per cent.READ MOREIncidentally  I’m told there’s no payment to Sky from RTÉ in return for the Player’s premier positioning on the platform. Not even a little something from one of the barter accounts.McKillen becomes Vietnam’s honorary consulPaddy McKillen told the Financial Times he had been inspired by the Viet Cong in his refurbishment of Claridge’s in London. Photograph: Yui Mok/PA WirePaddy McKillen snr has been appointed honorary consul for Vietnam  a country in which he has invested for 30 years  most notably in road construction but also a biotechnology campus in Hanoi. The official announcement will point out that this is the first time Vietnam has ever had an official representative in Dublin  since diplomatic relations have been handled via its embassy in London.Two years ago  McKillen told the Financial Times that he had been inspired by the Viet Cong in his refurbishment of Claridge’s in London. The developer wanted to double the size of the hotel while keeping it open  which engineers insisted was impossible. “I went down the Cu Chi tunnels in Vietnam  outside Saigon  dug by hand with spoons ” McKillen said. “They built hospitals and schools down there  and that’s how they defeated the Americans – with this network of tunnels. I came back and said  ‘Are you saying we don’t have the technology today to do the same under Claridge’s? Of course we have  we must have.’”His office as honorary consul is to be at 6 St Stephen’s Green in Dublin.Business Post Group liberated by Swedish investment“We are no longer prisoners of geography on our little North Atlantic island. We are liberated by technology and the power of AI ” businessman and round-the-world sailor Enda O’Coineen told staff at the Business Post on Tuesday after the conclusion of exhaustive talks with the Swedish publishing group Bonnier News  which has taken a strategic minority investment in the Business Post Group. The protracted process should ensure the future of the newspaper  with the expectation being that a company as big as Bonnier  which had a turnover of €762 million last year  is unlikely to remain a minority shareholder to Kilcullen Kapital forever.O’Coineen can expect a nice pay-day whenever he exits the Business Post  having almost tripled the group’s turnover  from €7.5 million to €22 million  since taking over in September 2018. While the newspaper is modestly profitable  as is the group’s conference company iQuest  the star performer is the polling company Red C Research.Bonnier already has a media presence in Ireland  having launched a book publishing imprint  Eriu  under the directorship of Deirdre Nolan last year. Among the titles it will be publishing this autumn are Born to be a Footballer  the autobiography of Liam Brady; We need to Talk by Dr Tony Holohan  the former chief medical officer; and Cocaine Cowboys  the first of two books it has commissioned from journalist Nicola Tallant.NTMA and bonusesThe National Treasury Management Agency made performance-related payments to 239 employees last year  totalling €2.24 million. The highest individual bonus was €30 000. One of those who didn’t benefit was the former chief executive Conor O’Kelly  whose term expired in June.What a difference 20 years makes. In 2003  the chief executive of the NTMA was Michael Somers  and he received a bonus of €303 000  or 69.6 per cent of his salary. In 2008  his second-last year in the job  Somers was paid €565 000 and a bonus of €403 000. Still  being chief executive of the NTMA is a good deal less onerous these days. With the economy awash with cash  Ireland will need to borrow much less on international markets over the coming years.Not that the culture of high pay has been entirely banished from the agency. According to its annual report  some 23 officials earned salaries of €200 000 or more last year  maintaining its reputation as the best remunerated precinct of the Irish public service.Euronext’s plea on share trading stamp dutyEuronext Dublin chief executive Daryl Byrne. Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillEuronext Dublin  as the Irish stock exchange is now known  warned the Department of Finance at a meeting on March 15th that it was “unlikely to keep three listings” of companies. Minutes of the meeting  which I obtained under the Freedom of Information Act  show that chief executive Daryl Byrne and Gillian Leeson  the exchange’s head of regulatory affairs  told civil servants that companies were potentially going to remove their secondary listing from Dublin “so they can move to the US”. While the companies are not named  we presume the reference was to CRH  Flutter and Diageo  which announced on April 13th that it was cancelling its Dublin listing. The drinks company left the exchange on May 30th.The dire consequences of CRH’s and Flutter’s departures had been spelt out in a warning letter to Minister for Finance Michael McGrath on March 3rd  in which Euronext appealed for help in keeping them. “The importance of equity capital markets as a funding mechanism for Irish companies was best demonstrated in 2020  during the pandemic  when Irish-listed companies raised over €4.2 billion from shareholders in secondary fundraising ” Byrne argued.Underlining the importance of Flutter and CRH  Byrne estimated they generated more than 60 per cent of the total stamp duty on trading in shares of Irish companies  worth €250 million-€300 million to the exchequer.So far the Department of Finance has taken no action. Euronext’s hope must be that McGrath will announce in the budget that the 1 per cent tax on share purchases is being halved.,negative,0.0,0.01,0.99,mixed,0.23,0.11,0.66,True,English,"['Dee Forbes’ position', 'Smurfit Business School', 'advisory board', 'UCD', 'former chief executive Conor O’Kelly', 'The National Treasury Management Agency', 'former chief medical officer', 'little North Atlantic island', 'many exceptional business leaders', 'two leading UCD professors', 'former director general', 'Hilary O’Meara', 'A&L Goodbody', 'Dr Margaret Cullen', 'popular TV platforms', 'Yui Mok/PA Wire', 'Enda O’Coineen', 'Red C Research', 'book publishing imprint', 'Dr Tony Holohan', 'journalist Nicola Tallant', 'other rival apps', 'Smurfit Business School', 'Michael Smurfit jnr', 'Cu Chi tunnels', 'strategic minority investment', 'highest individual bonus', 'Swedish publishing group', 'Business Post Group', 'Irish advisory board', 'Paddy McKillen snr', 'RTÉ Player app', 'little something', 'Swedish investment', 'two books', 'managing director', 'minority shareholder', 'Michael Somers', 'Other members', 'other goals', 'other words', 'standing member', 'David Widger', 'corporate department', 'collective knowledge', 'continued membership', 'Niamh Brennan', 'secret top-ups', 'public understatement', 'top-up scandal', 'press release', 'positive development', 'digital service', 'premier positioning', 'barter accounts', 'honorary consul', 'Financial Times', 'Viet Cong', 'road construction', 'biotechnology campus', 'official announcement', 'official representative', 'diplomatic relations', '6 St Stephen', 'exhaustive talks', 'Kilcullen Kapital', 'nice pay-day', 'star performer', 'media presence', 'Deirdre Nolan', 'Liam Brady', 'Cocaine Cowboys', 'performance-related payments', 'Sky Q', 'Sky customers', 'conference company', 'polling company', 'corporate governance', 'first time', 'Bonnier News', 'Dee Forbes', 'Sky viewers', 'Accenture', 'head', 'website', 'feature', 'support', 'collaboration', 'commitment', 'insight', 'academic', 'government', 'failures', 'weaknesses', 'culture', 'earnings', 'homework', 'spokeswoman', 'comment', 'launch', 'June', 'Ireland', 'Netflix', 'Amazon', 'Apple', 'Spotify', 'fairness', 'glitches', 'streams', 'READ', 'return', 'Vietnam', 'refurbishment', 'Claridge', 'London', 'Photograph', 'country', '30 years', 'Hanoi', 'Dublin', 'embassy', 'developer', 'size', 'hotel', 'engineers', 'Saigon', 'hand', 'spoons', 'hospitals', 'schools', 'Americans', 'network', 'Green', 'prisoners', 'geography', 'power', 'businessman', 'world', 'sailor', 'staff', 'Tuesday', 'conclusion', 'process', 'future', 'newspaper', 'expectation', 'turnover', 'September', 'iQuest', 'Eriu', 'directorship', 'titles', 'autumn', 'Footballer', 'autobiography', 'NTMA', 'bonuses', '239 employees', 'term', 'difference']",2023-07-07,2023-07-08,irishtimes.com

27481,EuroNext,Bing API,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4615529-aalberts-industries-i-expect-an-annualized-total-return-of-15-percent-until-2026,Aalberts: I Expect An Annualized Total Return Of 15% Until 2026 (OTCMKTS:AALBF),Aalberts is a leader in the valves and pipes sector and has ambitious growth plans. Learn how AALBF is able to deploy its growth capital at good ROCE.,"imagedepotpro/iStock via Getty ImagesIntroductionI remember the exact moment when I wrote my previous article on Aalberts N.V. (OTCPK:AALBF)  a Dutch leader in the valves and pipes sector. The COVID crisis was at its peak and the article was published on April 2 nd 2020  when the share price had dropped to less than 21 EUR. This meant the company had lost about 50% of its value in just six weeks and was trading at a six-year low. I argued the selloff was overdone (which was hardly rocket science back in the day  as investors were dumping pretty much everything they had)Yahoo FinanceAalberts Industries has a very liquid listing on Euronext Amsterdam  where the average daily volume is roughly 225 000 shares per day. The ticker symbol in Amsterdam is AALB  and as Aalberts has 110.6M shares outstanding  the market cap currently is approximately 4.25B EUR.Slow but steady growthThis article is meant as an update to my thesis from 2020. I'd like to recommend you to have another look at that older article to get a better understanding of the company's business model.Unfortunately  the company publishes detailed financial results only every six months and the Q1 update was really just a trading update without any numbers. This means it makes more sense to have a look back at the company's FY 2022 results. And 2022 was a good year for Aalberts  as it reported a revenue increase of almost 10% to 3.23B EUR. Unfortunately  this did not translate into a higher net income and  as you can see below  while the total operating expenses increased by almost 200M EUR  the lack of ""other net income"" made it difficult for Aalberts to report a higher operating profit.Aalberts Investor RelationsThat's not necessarily a big problem. Excluding the ""other income "" the operating profit in FY 2021 would have been just 330M EUR while the FY 2022 operating income would have come in at around 390M EUR  a clear improvement. The relatively high ""other income"" generated in the first quarter of 2021 was almost entirely related to the sale of a division. Aalberts sold its Lasco division and reported a 174M EUR gain on the disposal  while the disposal of VTI Ventil Tecnik and Elkhart in the first quarter of the current financial year resulted in a gain of less than 40M EUR  as you can see below.Aalberts Investor RelationsThis means we can't really hold the lower reported operating income against Aalberts  as the operating income in FY 2021 was clearly boosted by non-recurring elements and a comparison of the adjusted operating profit excluding these non-recurring items.In any case  the reported net income of 322.3M EUR (of which 317.3M EUR was attributable to the shareholders of Aalberts) still includes a chunk of non-recurring items  which likely contributed about 10% of the after-tax income. The EPS in FY 2022 was approximately 2.87 EUR per share  which means the stock is currently trading at 13 times the net income and about 14-14.5 times the net income excluding the non-recurring items.The cash flow statement also helps to isolate the impact of the non-recurring items. As you can see below  the reported operating cash flow does not take the (non-cash) gain on asset sales into account. The total reported operating cash flow was 247M EUR  but this includes a 243M EUR investment in the working capital position  which means the underlying operating cash flow was 491M EUR and about 478M EUR after deducting the total amount of taxes owed based on the FY 2022 result versus the total amount of tax that was actually paid.Aalberts Investor RelationsFrom the 478M EUR  we should also deduct the 37M EUR in lease payments  which means the adjusted operating cash flow was 441M EUR. And as you can see below  the total capex was approximately 202M EUR (excluding acquisitions but including the purchase of intangibles).Aalberts Investor RelationsThis means the FY 2022 free cash flow result was approximately 239M EUR excluding the impact from the gain on the asset dispositions and including a total capex + lease payments of 239M EUR versus a total depreciation expense of just 188M EUR (this clearly shows Aalberts is still investing in growth). The total capex will likely increase further this year as Aalberts continues to pursue high-margin growth. Its financial objectives for the 2022-2026 era are to generate a ROCE of in excess of 18% on its investments.Aalberts Investor RelationsAnd using the 3.23B EUR in 2021 revenue as a starting point and applying a 4% annual revenue growth from here on  the FY 2026 revenue would increase to 3.75B EUR and a 17% EBITA margin (not a typo  Aalberts does not provide an EBITDA guidance but an EBITA guidance) would result in a total EBITA of 642M EUR. That's approximately 30% higher than the FY 2022 EBITA of 500M EUR. This would add about 1-1.10 EUR per share to the earnings profile.Investment thesisWhile Aalberts isn't cheap right now (the stock is trading at a free cash flow yield of 5% (including growth investments)  the market is clearly forward-looking and likes the 2022-2026 plan. This means that by 2026 the sustaining free cash flow will likely exceed 3.75-3.80 EUR per share (excluding the impact from dispositions)  and that is not necessarily expensive for a leader in its sector. Applying a 7% required free cash flow yield  the fair share price would be around 55 EUR per share in 2026  and in order to get there the share price would have to increase by 13% per year. Add the 3% dividend yield and the potential for a total annual return of 15% is pretty realistic.I currently don't have a position in Aalberts  but I like how this company is managed and I like the anticipated 18-20% ROCE on growth investments. I will likely write some out of the money put options  as I would like to pick up stock in the mid-30 EUR range.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.
