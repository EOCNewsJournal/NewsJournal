This building of 4   600 sq.m will be operated by DSV Road  as part of a lease with a 9-year fixed term .After entering the French Normandie market in 2022 by delivering two logistics platforms near Rouen and Caen  ARGAN is now developing a new site in this area. The group has indeed initiated the construction of a distribution centre totalling 4 600 sq.m  on the municipality of Eslettes  located about 15 kilometres away from the Northern limits of Rouen.The agency under development will be operated by DSV  a major international player that offers transport and logistics services  through its DSV Road subsidiary  as part of a lease with a 9-year fixed term. This is the second time that DSV and ARGAN work together  as our group already owns the site located in Gennevilliers that is also operated by the company specializing in transport and logistics solutions.With this new development  ARGAN is confirming its ability to support its lease customers' growth.A particular attention was given to limiting the site's carbon footprint. With an Aut0nom® label  the building will generate and use its own green energy thanks to a photovoltaic power plant on its roof  together with batteries for energy storage. This equipment will help cover a significant part of DSV's energy needs; it will also contribute to one of the group's targets included in its approach to decarbonizing transportation and logistics through consistent improvement in its buildings'eco-efficiency.All of these investments are beneficial to targeting a 'BREEAM Very Good' certification.Jean-Claude Le Lan  President of the Supervisory Board of ARGAN  concluded:“Developed around the most important French harbour  and as close as possible to the Ile-de-France region  the French Normandie market is buoyant. This is why we have a particular focus on this area and want to take part in its economic development. On this basis  the warm welcome demonstrated by local officials is a very favourable factor. Working with the Municipalities Association (Communauté de Communes) ofInter-Caux Vexin and the City officials of Eslettes has helped the positive deployment of this project  which will give a further boost to the regions' economic momentum.”Financial calendar 2023 (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)July 19: 2023 Half-year results October 2: 2023 3rd quarter salesAbout ArganARGAN is the only French real estate company specializing in the DEVELOPMENT & RENTAL OF PREMIUM WAREHOUSES listed on EURONEXT.As at December 31  2022  ARGAN's portfolio amounted to 3.5 million sq.m  comprising approximately 100 warehouses located exclusively in France  valued at €4.0 billion.

July 10  2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NANOBIOTIX (Euronext: NANO –– NASDAQ: NBTX – the ‘‘Company’’)  a late-clinical stage biotechnology company pioneering physics-based approaches to expand treatment possibilities for patients with cancer  today announced a global licensing  co-development  and commercialization agreement with Janssen Pharmaceutica NV (“Janssen”)  one of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson  for the investigational  potential first-in-class radioenhancer NBTXR3.NBTXR3 is currently being evaluated in several studies across solid tumor indications including NANORAY-312  a global Phase 3 pivotal study evaluating NBTXR3 for the treatment of patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer. NBTXR3 is also being evaluated for its potential as a systemic agent in combination with anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors for patients with metastatic cancers.Under the terms of the license agreement  in collaboration with the Interventional Oncology R&D Unit at Johnson & Johnson  Nanobiotix will grant Janssen a worldwide license for the development and commercialization of NBTXR3. The license is exclusive  excepting territories previously licensed to Nanobiotix partner LianBio. Dial-in information for a conference call Nanobiotix will host to discuss the agreement can be found below.“As pioneers in the field of nanotherapeutics for the past 20 years  we knew that the true impact of our innovation in oncology would be in its potential to reach millions of patients around the world. For that  we needed to find the right partner  at the right time  with proven global development and commercialization capabilities ” said Laurent Levy  Nanobiotix chairman of the executive board. “We are delighted to collaborate with Janssen as we aim to improve the lives of patients with cancer around the world.”Nanobiotix will receive near term cash and operational support valued up to $60 million. This includes an upfront cash licensing fee of $30 million  and in-kind regulatory and development support for study NANORAY-312 valued at up to $30 million that Janssen may provide at its sole discretion. Nanobiotix will maintain operational control of NANORAY-312 and all other currently ongoing studies  along with NBTXR3 manufacture  clinical supply  and initial commercial supply. Janssen will be fully responsible for an initial Phase 2 study evaluating NBTXR3 for patients with stage three lung cancer and will have the right to assume control of studies currently led by Nanobiotix.Nanobiotix is eligible for success-based payments of up to $1.8 billion  in the aggregate  relating to potential development  regulatory  and sales milestones. Moreover  the agreement includes a framework for additional success-based potential development and regulatory milestone payments of up to $650 million  in the aggregate  for five new indications that may be developed by Janssen at its sole discretion; and of up to $220 million  in the aggregate  per indication that may be developed by Nanobiotix in alignment with Janssen.Following commercialization  Nanobiotix will also receive tiered double-digit royalties on net sales of NBTXR3.“We expect this agreement  and the collaboration it enables  to further drive the expansion of NBTXR3 development and accelerate the realization of its promise for patients in need ” said Bart van Rhijn  Nanobiotix chief financial officer. “We look forward to maximizing the value of NBTXR3 for our global stakeholders.”Separately  Nanobiotix is eligible to receive up to $30 million in equity investments from Johnson & Johnson Innovation – JJDC  Inc. (“JJDC”) including  as part of capital increases without preferential subscription rights: (1) an initial tranche equal to the lower of 5% of the Company and $5 million; and (2) a second tranche of $25 million subject to certain maximum ownership caps in connection with a future financing.The price of the initial tranche will be equal to $5.21 per American Depositary Share (“ADS”) if that price (1) is approved by Nanobiotix shareholders or (2) exceeds 85% of the volume-weighted average price (“VWAP”) of Nanobiotix ordinary shares on Euronext: Paris for three consecutive trading days  starting with the fourth trading day after the date of agreement  in each case if occurring within the ninety trading days following the date f the agreement. Also  JJDC may elect any time during that ninety-trading day period to instead consummate the initial tranche at a price per ADS equal to 85% of the VWAP of Nanobiotix ordinary shares on Euronext for three consecutive trading days starting with the fourth trading day after the date of the agreement. The second  $25 million tranche is conditioned upon  and at the same price as  a concurrent Nanobiotix financing with gross proceeds of at least $25 million (excluding the potential investment by JJDC) occurring prior to certain long-term development milestones or December 31  2027  at the latest.For illustrative purposes only1  in the event that the initial tranche is implemented at $5.21 per ADS  the dilutive impact for shareholders resulting from this capital increase would be 0.97% and JJDC group would own 2.65% of the Company’s share capital.The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory clearances including clearance by US antitrust authorities under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act  and will become effective as soon as these conditions have been met.As of the date the license agreement becomes effective  prior to utilizing the second tranche of equity investment outlined above and excluding near term development milestones  Nanobiotix expects to extend its cash runway into the first quarter of 2024.The above statements are subject to the assumptions and risks described in the Cautionary Statement section of this press release below.Conference Call and WebcastNanobiotix will host a conference call and live audio webcast on Monday  July 10  2023  at 8:30 AM EDT / 2:30 PM CEST  prior to the open of the U.S. market.

The launch of the Phase 3 program follows promising results from the SARA-INT Phase 2b study and discussions with health authorities in 2022. Based on the results of the previous study and feedback from the U.S. government agency  Biophytis is starting its Phase 3 program by filing the first ever Phase 3 application (SARA-31) in sarcopenia with the FDA. This follows the recent submission to the European Medicines Agency. The objective of the SARA-31 phase 3 study in sarcopenia is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Sarconeos (BIO101) in the treatment of sarcopenic patients at risk of mobility disability. Approximately 900 patients over 65 years of age with severe sarcopenia (3 ≤ SPPB ≤ 7) with low walking speed (4-m Gait speed ≤ 0.8 m/s) and low grip strength (HGS < 20kg for women and < 35.5 kg for men) will be included. They will be treated for a minimum of 12 months and a maximum of 36 months  receiving either placebo or 350mg of Sarconeos (BIO101) twice daily. The primary endpoint will be the assessment of the risk of Major Mobility Disability (MMD)  measured by the ability to walk 400m in less than 15 minutes over time. In addition to this primary endpoint  the following secondary endpoints will be assessed: walking speed (4-m walking speed from the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) test)  handgrip strength (HGS) and patient-reported quality of life (Patient Reported Outcome SarQol  a questionnaire developed specifically for sarcopenia). Biophytis expects a response from the regulatory authorities during the third quarter of 2023  which would enable Biophytis to initiate the study in the United States. The principal investigator will be Roger A. Fielding  PhD  who heads the Nutrition  Physiology  Exercise and Sarcopenia (NEPS) Laboratory at Tufts University in Boston. Stanislas Veillet  Chairman and CEO of Biophytis stated: « Following the success of SARA-INT's phase 2b clinical trial  the filing of an application with the EMA in mid-May and with the FDA today for the launch of a phase 3 clinical trial in sarcopenia is a major milestone in the development of our drug candidate. We are pioneers in the field of sarcopenia and intend to be the first company to launch  in partnership with global or regional pharmaceutical companies  a phase 3 clinical development program in this indication. » * * * * About BIOPHYTIS Biophytis SA is a clinical-stage biotechnology company specializing in the development of drug candidates for age-related diseases.
