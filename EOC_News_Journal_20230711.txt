This building of 4 600 sq.m will be operated by DSV Road  as part of a lease with a 9-year fixed term.After entering the French Normandie market in 2022 by delivering two logistics platforms near Rouen and Caen  ARGAN is now developing a new site in this area. The group has indeed initiated the construction of a distribution centre totalling 4 600 sq.m  on the municipality of Eslettes  located about 15 kilometres away from the Northern limits of Rouen.The agency under development will be operated by DSV  a major international player that offers transport and logistics services  through its DSV Road subsidiary  as part of a lease with a 9-year fixed term. This is the second time that DSV and ARGAN work together  as our group already owns the site located in Gennevilliers that is also operated by the company specializing in transport and logistics solutions.With this new development  ARGAN is confirming its ability to support its lease customers‚Äô growth.A particular attention was given to limiting the site‚Äôs carbon footprint. With an Aut0nom¬Æ label  the building will generate and use its own green energy thanks to a photovoltaic power plant on its roof  together with batteries for energy storage. This equipment will help cover a significant part of DSV‚Äôs energy needs; it will also contribute to one of the group‚Äôs targets included in its approach to decarbonizing transportation and logistics through consistent improvement in its buildings‚Äôeco-efficiency.All of these investments are beneficial to targeting a ‚ÄòBREEAM Very Good‚Äô certification.Jean-Claude Le Lan  President of the Supervisory Board of ARGAN  concluded: ‚ÄúDeveloped around the most important French harbour  and as close as possible to the Ile-de-France region  the French Normandie market is buoyant. This is why we have a particular focus on this area and want to take part in its economic development. On this basis  the warm welcome demonstrated by local officials is a very favourable factor. Working with the Municipalities Association (Communaut√© de Communes) ofInter-Caux Vexin and the City officials of Eslettes has helped the positive deployment of this project  which will give a further boost to the regions‚Äô economic momentum.‚ÄùFinancial calendar 2023 (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)July 19: 2023 Half-year resultsOctober 2: 2023 3rd quarter salesAbout ArganARGAN is the only French real estate company specializing in the DEVELOPMENT & RENTAL OF PREMIUM WAREHOUSES listed on EURONEXT.As at December 31  2022  ARGAN‚Äôs portfolio amounted to 3.5 million sq.m  comprising approximately 100 warehouses located exclusively in France  valued at ‚Ç¨4.0 billion.

It involves an order to supply up to 25 Ebusco 2.2 buses in 12-metre versions.S√ºdwestdeutsche Landesverkehrs GmbH (SWEG) is a public transport company in southwest Germany. Together with its subsidiaries  it operates a fleet of around 470 buses. The company plans to deploy the buses in the Baden-W√ºrttemberg region. The buses are expected to drive around 60 000 km per year  saving roughly 55 000 kilograms of CO2 and over 90 000 grams of nitrogen per bus on an annual basis.It is not the first time for SWEG to take Ebusco buses on the road. Last year  the German transport company already placed an order for 10 Ebusco 2.2 12-metre buses  the first of which are now in operation. These are low-floor buses  equipped with two doors and an extended battery pack (>400 kWh).With Ebusco 2.2 buses in cities such as Berlin  Munich and Frankfurt  the Ebusco 2.2 is now a proven success in Germany. The bus is known for its very low energy consumption and high battery capacity. The Ebusco 2.2 comes standard with LFP batteries and  depending on the capacity chosen  has a range of up to 450 km. This makes the bus a very reliable choice for transport companies making the switch to electric.Wolfgang Hackauf  Sales Director at Ebusco  comments:""We are very proud that SWEG has once again chosen Ebusco. The Ebusco 2.2 is a hugely reliable and energy-efficient bus  making it a good choice. We  therefore  look forward to continuing our cooperation with SWEG and continuing our journey towards zero emissions together.""Dr Thilo Grabo  Managing Director at SWEG  commented ""After our first experiences with the Ebusco 2.2  we are particularly impressed by the long range of the vehicle. We are very pleased to further expand the use of electric mobility in our bus operations with this contract and thus make our fleet even more environmentally friendly.""",neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,positive,0.85,0.15,0.0,True,English,"['Ebusco N', 'follow-up order', 'footprint', 'Germany', 'SWEG', 'S√ºdwestdeutsche Landesverkehrs GmbH', 'S√ºdwestdeutsche Landesverkehrs-GmbH', 'Baden-W√ºrttemberg region', 'extended battery pack', 'low energy consumption', 'Dr Thilo Grabo', 'public transport company', 'German transport company', 'high battery capacity', '10 Ebusco 2.2 12-metre buses', 'transport companies', '12-metre versions', 'charging systems', 'annual basis', 'first time', 'two doors', 'proven success', 'LFP batteries', 'Wolfgang Hackauf', 'Sales Director', 'zero emissions', 'Managing Director', 'first experiences', 'low-floor buses', 'electric mobility', 'The Ebusco', 'new contract', 'southwest Germany', 'good choice', 'long range', 'electric buses', '25 Ebusco 2.2 buses', 'Ebusco buses', 'energy-efficient bus', 'bus operations', '470 buses', 'Deurne', 'pioneer', 'frontrunner', 'development', 'SWEG', 'order', 'subsidiaries', 'fleet', '60,000 km', 'year', '55,000 kilograms', 'CO2', '90,000 grams', 'nitrogen', 'road', '>400 kWh', 'cities', 'Berlin', 'Munich', 'Frankfurt', '450 km', 'switch', 'reliable', 'cooperation', 'journey', 'vehicle']",2023-07-10,2023-07-11,marketscreener.com

July 10  2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NANOBIOTIX (Euronext: NANO ‚Äì‚Äì NASDAQ: NBTX ‚Äì the ‚Äò‚ÄòCompany‚Äô‚Äô)  a late-clinical stage biotechnology company pioneering physics-based approaches to expand treatment possibilities for patients with cancer  today announced a global licensing  co-development  and commercialization agreement with Janssen Pharmaceutica NV (‚ÄúJanssen‚Äù)  one of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson  for the investigational  potential first-in-class radioenhancer NBTXR3.NBTXR3 is currently being evaluated in several studies across solid tumor indications including NANORAY-312  a global Phase 3 pivotal study evaluating NBTXR3 for the treatment of patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer. NBTXR3 is also being evaluated for its potential as a systemic agent in combination with anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors for patients with metastatic cancers.Under the terms of the license agreement  in collaboration with the Interventional Oncology R&D Unit at Johnson & Johnson  Nanobiotix will grant Janssen a worldwide license for the development and commercialization of NBTXR3. The license is exclusive  excepting territories previously licensed to Nanobiotix partner LianBio. Dial-in information for a conference call Nanobiotix will host to discuss the agreement can be found below.‚ÄúAs pioneers in the field of nanotherapeutics for the past 20 years  we knew that the true impact of our innovation in oncology would be in its potential to reach millions of patients around the world. For that  we needed to find the right partner  at the right time  with proven global development and commercialization capabilities ‚Äù said Laurent Levy  Nanobiotix chairman of the executive board. ‚ÄúWe are delighted to collaborate with Janssen as we aim to improve the lives of patients with cancer around the world.‚ÄùNanobiotix will receive near term cash and operational support valued up to $60 million. This includes an upfront cash licensing fee of $30 million  and in-kind regulatory and development support for study NANORAY-312 valued at up to $30 million that Janssen may provide at its sole discretion. Nanobiotix will maintain operational control of NANORAY-312 and all other currently ongoing studies  along with NBTXR3 manufacture  clinical supply  and initial commercial supply. Janssen will be fully responsible for an initial Phase 2 study evaluating NBTXR3 for patients with stage three lung cancer and will have the right to assume control of studies currently led by Nanobiotix.Nanobiotix is eligible for success-based payments of up to $1.8 billion  in the aggregate  relating to potential development  regulatory  and sales milestones. Moreover  the agreement includes a framework for additional success-based potential development and regulatory milestone payments of up to $650 million  in the aggregate  for five new indications that may be developed by Janssen at its sole discretion; and of up to $220 million  in the aggregate  per indication that may be developed by Nanobiotix in alignment with Janssen.Following commercialization  Nanobiotix will also receive tiered double-digit royalties on net sales of NBTXR3.‚ÄúWe expect this agreement  and the collaboration it enables  to further drive the expansion of NBTXR3 development and accelerate the realization of its promise for patients in need ‚Äù said Bart van Rhijn  Nanobiotix chief financial officer. ‚ÄúWe look forward to maximizing the value of NBTXR3 for our global stakeholders.‚ÄùSeparately  Nanobiotix is eligible to receive up to $30 million in equity investments from Johnson & Johnson Innovation ‚Äì JJDC  Inc. (‚ÄúJJDC‚Äù) including  as part of capital increases without preferential subscription rights: (1) an initial tranche equal to the lower of 5% of the Company and $5 million; and (2) a second tranche of $25 million subject to certain maximum ownership caps in connection with a future financing.The price of the initial tranche will be equal to $5.21 per American Depositary Share (‚ÄúADS‚Äù) if that price (1) is approved by Nanobiotix shareholders or (2) exceeds 85% of the volume-weighted average price (‚ÄúVWAP‚Äù) of Nanobiotix ordinary shares on Euronext: Paris for three consecutive trading days  starting with the fourth trading day after the date of agreement  in each case if occurring within the ninety trading days following the date f the agreement. Also  JJDC may elect any time during that ninety-trading day period to instead consummate the initial tranche at a price per ADS equal to 85% of the VWAP of Nanobiotix ordinary shares on Euronext for three consecutive trading days starting with the fourth trading day after the date of the agreement. The second  $25 million tranche is conditioned upon  and at the same price as  a concurrent Nanobiotix financing with gross proceeds of at least $25 million (excluding the potential investment by JJDC) occurring prior to certain long-term development milestones or December 31  2027  at the latest.For illustrative purposes only1  in the event that the initial tranche is implemented at $5.21 per ADS  the dilutive impact for shareholders resulting from this capital increase would be 0.97% and JJDC group would own 2.65% of the Company‚Äôs share capital.The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory clearances including clearance by US antitrust authorities under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act  and will become effective as soon as these conditions have been met.As of the date the license agreement becomes effective  prior to utilizing the second tranche of equity investment outlined above and excluding near term development milestones  Nanobiotix expects to extend its cash runway into the first quarter of 2024.The above statements are subject to the assumptions and risks described in the Cautionary Statement section of this press release below.Conference Call and WebcastNanobiotix will host a conference call and live audio webcast on Monday  July 10  2023  at 8:30 AM EDT / 2:30 PM CEST  prior to the open of the U.S. market.

In this context  the Company is strengthening its Board of Directors with a view to further enriching the diversity of skills and expertise of its independent members. To that end  the Board of Ubisoft has proposed the nomination of two new independent directors with strong international executive backgrounds at its upcoming September Annual General meeting (AGM). Claude France  who joined the Board in July 2022 to bring her digital and tech expertise as well as her experience in managing large scale organizations  will be appointed as the new Lead Independent Director as well as Chairwoman of the Audit & Risk Committee.Proposed nomination of two new independent DirectorsUbisoft‚Äôs Board of Directors  upon the recommendation of the Nomination  Compensation and Governance Committee  has decided to submit to the vote of shareholders the appointment of Katherine Hays and Olfa Zorgati  as new independent board members.Katherine Hays (47) has more than 20 years of experience across esports  gaming  advertising  media and entertainment as an entrepreneur and executive. She is currently an independent member of the Board of Technicolor Creative Studios (since 2022)  serves as an advisor to numerous esports start-ups  and is a senior advisor to institutional investors within the United Arab Emirates. In 2008  she was appointed as the CEO of Genarts  Inc.  based in Cambridge  USA  and led the company to become the top provider of special effects software for the professional market. In 2003  she co-founded Massive  an in-game advertising company until its acquisition by Microsoft in 2006. She started her career as an equity research analyst at Salomon Smith Barney and Goldman Sachs. Katherine holds an MBA from Harvard Business School and a Bachelor of Art from Princeton University and is of American nationality.Olfa Zorgati (49) has extensive financial and management experience  with a deep expertise in technology. She is currently Chief Financial Officer as well as Executive Vice-President Operations and is on the Executive Committee of ESI Group  a c.‚Ç¨1bn market cap software and technology company listed on Euronext Paris  which she joined in 2018. She was the CFO of MetaPack (2016-2017)  a London-based global SaaS leader for e-commerce logistics systems. Prior to this  she was CFO  then COO  of VentureBeat (2013-2015)  based in San Francisco  USA. Olfa started her career with Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale in mergers and acquisitions and with Vivendi at various finance functions. She holds an MBA from HEC Paris and is a dual Tunisian and French citizen.The Board has carried out this evolution of its composition through a thorough and diligent process  over several months  led by the Nomination  Compensation & Governance Committee with the support of Egon Zehnder  a leading international executive search firm. Profiles considered included highly skilled candidates with significant international experience as CEO/CFO or directors of listed companies and/or relevant expertise in the technology  entertainment  or video game industries.Should the AGM approve the nomination of the two proposed candidates  half of the independent members of the Board will have been renewed over the past 12 months.These candidates will succeed two Board members: as planned  Didier Crespel will not be renewed at the upcoming AGM. Florence Naviner has expressed her wish to allocate more time on professional ventures and has therefore requested to be relieved from her Board position as of the next AGM.New Lead Independent Director and additions to committeesOver the past decade  Ubisoft‚Äôs Board has demonstrated its commitment to continuously adapting its governance to the best standards. To that end  the Board created the Lead Independent Director (LID) role in 2016  added independent directors so that they comprised a majority of all Board members in 2016. The Audit Committee and the Nomination  Compensation and Governance Committee have been fully independent since 2013. The Board also complied with the Cop√©-Zimmermann law to have at least 40% gender diversity by 2017. If the two candidates proposed by the Board are approved by shareholders  the Board will have female representation of 55%.In line with these guiding principles  Ubisoft today announces that Claude France  who had joined Ubisoft‚Äôs Board as an independent director of Ubisoft in July 2022  has been appointed as the new Lead Independent Director (LID)  replacing Didier Crespel. Throughout her career  Claude has held various leadership positions in Tech and digital businesses  including most recently as a member of the Executive Committee of Worldline  a CAC-40 global leader in payment technologies where she managed a business unit of 4 000+ people as well as significant transformation projects.Additional evolutions to the Board composition have been implemented with the appointment of Claude France as Chairwoman of the Audit & Risk Committee. Given their profiles and extensive financial expertise  the two proposed director candidates would be ideally positioned to contribute to the work of the Audit & Risk Committee in due time.Lionel Bouchet  as employee representative  is joining the Nomination  Compensation & Governance Committee  in line with French AFEP-MEDEF recommendations. As a reminder  Ubisoft‚Äôs Board of Directors includes three employee representatives.Yves Guillemot  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  said: ‚ÄúWe are committed to continuously adapting Ubisoft‚Äôs organization  including its Board  to best respond to the rapidly changing industry  while accelerating on the execution of our strategy to reach a significantly larger audience and grow our recurring revenues. We are pleased to present to our shareholders‚Äô vote two highly qualified candidates  Katherine Hays and Olfa Zorgati. With their appointment and together with the additional Director refreshments made over the last 3 years  we further strengthen the Board with a diverse set of relevant skills  experiences and perspectives to the benefit of Ubisoft and its shareholders. On behalf of the entire Board of Directors  I would like to thank Didier Crespel and Florence Naviner for their commitment and key contributions to the Board‚Äôs work.""About Katherine HaysKatherine Hays (47) has more than 20 years of experience across esports  gaming  advertising  media and entertainment as an entrepreneur and executive.

In this context  the Company is strengthening its Board of Directors with a view to further enriching the diversity of skills and expertise of its independent members. To that end  the Board of Ubisoft has proposed the nomination of two new independent directors with strong international executive backgrounds at its upcoming September Annual General meeting (AGM). Claude France  who joined the Board in July 2022 to bring her digital and tech expertise as well as her experience in managing large scale organizations  will be appointed as the new Lead Independent Director as well as Chairwoman of the Audit & Risk Committee.Proposed nominationof two new independent DirectorsUbisoft‚Äôs Board of Directors  upon the recommendation of the Nomination  Compensation and Governance Committee  has decided to submit to the vote of shareholders the appointment of Katherine Hays and Olfa Zorgati  as new independent board members.Katherine Hays (47) has more than 20 years of experience across esports  gaming  advertising  media and entertainment as an entrepreneur and executive. She is currently an independent member of the Board of Technicolor Creative Studios (since 2022)  serves as an advisor to numerous esports start-ups  and is a senior advisor to institutional investors within the United Arab Emirates. In 2008  she was appointed as the CEO of Genarts  Inc.  based in Cambridge  USA  and led the company to become the top provider of special effects software for the professional market. In 2003  she co-founded Massive  an in-game advertising company until its acquisition by Microsoft in 2006. She started her career as an equity research analyst at Salomon Smith Barney and Goldman Sachs. Katherine holds an MBA from Harvard Business School and a Bachelor of Art from Princeton University and is of American nationality.OlfaZorgati (49) has extensive financial and management experience  with a deep expertise in technology.

Prior to this  she was CFO  then COO  of VentureBeat (2013-2015)  based in San Francisco  USA. Olfa started her career with Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale in mergers and acquisitions and with Vivendi at various finance functions. She holds an MBA from HEC Paris and is a dual Tunisian and French citizen.The Board has carried out this evolution of its composition through a thorough and diligent process  over several months  led by the Nomination  Compensation & Governance Committee with the support of Egon Zehnder  a leading international executive search firm. Profiles considered included highly skilled candidates with significant international experience as CEO/CFO or directors of listed companies and/or relevant expertise in the technology  entertainment  or video game industries.Should the AGM approve the nomination of the two proposed candidates  half of the independent members of the Board will have been renewed over the past 12 months.These candidates will succeed two Board members: as planned  Didier Crespel will not be renewed at the upcoming AGM. Florence Naviner has expressed her wish to allocate more time on professional ventures and has therefore requested to be relieved from her Board position as of the next AGM.New Lead Independent Director and additions to committeesOver the past decade  Ubisoft‚Äôs Board has demonstrated its commitment to continuously adapting its governance to the best standards. To that end  the Board created the Lead Independent Director (LID) role in 2016  added independent directors so that they comprised a majority of all Board members in 2016. The Audit Committee and the Nomination  Compensation and Governance Committee have been fully independent since 2013. The Board also complied with the Cop√©-Zimmermann law to have at least 40% gender diversity by 2017. If the two candidates proposed by the Board are approved by shareholders  the Board will have female representation of 55%.In line with these guiding principles  Ubisoft today announces that Claude France  who had joined Ubisoft‚Äôs Board as an independent director of Ubisoft in July 2022  has been appointed as the new Lead Independent Director (LID)  replacing Didier Crespel. Throughout her career  Claude has held various leadership positions in Tech and digital businesses  including most recently as a member of the Executive Committee of Worldline  a CAC-40 global leader in payment technologies where she managed a business unit of 4 000+ people as well as significant transformation projects.Additional evolutions to the Board composition have been implemented with the appointment of Claude France as Chairwoman of the Audit & Risk Committee. Given their profiles and extensive financial expertise  the two proposed director candidates would be ideally positioned to contribute to the work of the Audit & Risk Committee in due time.Lionel Bouchet  as employee representative  is joining the Nomination  Compensation & Governance Committee  in line with French AFEP-MEDEF recommendations. As a reminder  Ubisoft‚Äôs Board of Directors includes three employee representatives.Yves Guillemot  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  said: ‚ÄúWe are committed to continuously adapting Ubisoft‚Äôs organization  including its Board  to best respond to the rapidly changing industry  whileaccelerating on the execution of our strategy to reach a significantly larger audience and grow our recurring revenues. We are pleased to present to our shareholders‚Äô vote two highly qualified candidates Katherine Hays and OlfaZorgati. With their appointment and together with the additional Director refreshments made over the last 3 years  we further strengthen the Board with a diverse set of relevant skills  experiences and perspectives to the benefit of Ubisoft and its shareholders.

Key target indications for the platforms include Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD)  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) and high-risk tibial fractures.Following the merger in October 2022  BioSenic combined the strategic positionings and strengths of Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics. The merger enables Biosenic to add to its innovative cell therapy platform and strong IP for tissue repair protection  an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/OATO (oral ATO)..BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com .About BioSenic technology platformsBioSenic‚Äôs technology is based on two main platforms:The allogeneic cell and gene therapy platform  developed by BioSenic with differentiated bone marrow sourced Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs)  that can be stored at the point of use in hospitals. Its current investigational medicinal product  ALLOB  represents a unique  proprietary approach to organ repair and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated stromal cells from healthy donors into bone-forming cells on the site of injury. These cells are produced via a BioSenic's scalable manufacturing process. Following the CTA (Clinical Trial Application) approval by regulatory authorities in Europe  BioSenic had initiated patient recruitment for the Phase IIb clinical trial with ALLOB in patients with difficult tibial fractures  using its optimized production process. ALLOB has been evaluated in a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase IIb study in patients with high-risk tibial fractures  using its optimized production process  after a successful first safety and efficacy study (Phase 1/2a) on fractured long bones  with late delayed union. The patient recruitment has been halted late February 2023 with 57 patients and the new rules permitted for statistical analysis allowed BioSenic to get the main results of this trial much earlier than anticipated in the original protocol. In June 2023  BioSenic decided to suspend its interventional trial on fracture healing using ALLOB  following negative results obtained for the primary endpoint in the exploratory Phase IIb clinical trial with ALLOB  focused on safety and treatment timing efficacy (choice between early or late treatment). The Arsenic TriOxide (ATO) platform developed by Medsenic. The immunomodulatory properties of ATO have demonstrated a double basic effect on cells of the immune system. The first effect is the increase of the cell oxidative stress in activated B  T or other cells of the innate/adaptative immune system to the point they will enter a cell death program (apoptosis) and be eliminated. The second effect is potent immunomodulatory properties on several pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in inflammatory or autoimmune cell pathways  with return to homeostasis. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. GvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). GvHD is primarily mediated by the transplanted immune cells that can lead to severe multiorgan damage. Medsenic has been successful in a Phase II trial with its intravenous formulation  with orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA. The company is heading towards an international Phase III confirmatory study  with its new  IP protected  oral (OATO) formulation. Moderate to severe forms of Systemic Lupus erythematosus (SLE) is another selected target  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae and the gastro-intestinal tract) in an early Phase IIa study.Systemic Sclerosis is also part of the clinical pipeline of BioSenic. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive. This gives good grounds to launch a Phase II clinical protocol. This serious chronic disease badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and has no actual current effective treatment.In addition  BioSenic is working on a next-generation  off-the-shelf  enhanced viscosupplement  JTA  for knee osteoarthritis (OA)  made of a unique combination of mammalian plasma proteins  derivatives of hyaluronic acid (a natural component of synovial fluid in the knee) and a third active component. JTA or some derivatives intend to provide added lubrication and protection to the cartilage of the arthritic joint and to alleviate osteoarthritic pain (OA) and inflammation. In March 2023  after the clinical identification of distinct OA subtypes  BioSenic delivered a new post-hoc analysis of its Phase III JTA-004 trial on knee OA  demonstrating positive action on the most severely affected patient sub-population. This new post-hoc analysis drastically changes the therapeutic profile of the combined components and allows for better patient targeting in future clinical developments. The company  which does not intend to allocate R&D resources to support the clinical development of JTA-004  will focus its R&D and clinical activities on an accelerated development of its autoimmune (ATO/OATO) platform.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAFran√ßois Rieger  PhD  Chief Executive OfficerTel: +33 (0)671 73 31 59investorrelations@biosenic.comInternational Media Enquiries:IB CommunicationsNeil Hunter / Michelle BoxallTel: +44 (0)20 8943 4685neil.hunter@ibcomms.agency / michelle@ibcomms.agencyFor French Investor Enquiries:Seitosei ActifinGhislaine GasparettoTel: +33 (0)1 56 88 11 22ggasparetto@actifin.frCertain statements  beliefs and opinions in this press release are forward-looking  which reflect the Company or  as appropriate  the Company directors‚Äô current expectations and projections about future events.

HIGHLIGHTS Follow up drilling planned at Mineral Jackpot  M2 copper prospect and the OMCO MineRhyolite Dome at Olympic Gold Project now a focus of exploration activityPositive results from soil sampling at M5 and Rock HouseFurther pre-mined material identified for processing INTRODUCTION During the past winter  Great Western carried out a thorough desktop review of most of the Company's claims in Nevada and in the first three months of field operations has followed this up with work on the ground which is still ongoing  in particular soil sampling and analysis in areas considered prospective for both precious metals and base metals. A total of 53 soil samples and 43 grab samples have been taken to date  covering (1) the Olympic Gold Project (2) Rock House where the Company successfully drilled in 2021 and 2022 and (3) the Jack Springs group (also known as JS) which is considered to be prospective but has not until now been selected as an exploration priority. Positive results have been achieved in all three areas. Olympic Gold Project In 2020 Great Western acquired a 4-year option to purchase the 800-acre Olympic Gold Project and one further payment of $40 000  due no later than May 2024  will complete this purchase. Olympic contains multiple gold prospects and was host to the prolific and high-grading OMCO gold mine between the two world wars. Drilling History: Over the last two years  Great Western has drilled numerous holes at Olympic covering three prospects: Trafalgar Hill  West Ridge and the OMCO Mine site. The best intercept at Trafalgar Hill was 8.9 g/t au. There were no intercepts at West Ridge  but subsequent analysis indicates that follow-up holes are warranted. In the OMCO Mine area  Hole OMRC015 drilled in 2022 significantly discovered what the Company believes to be an extension of the abandoned OMCO gold mine. In the spring of this year the Company mobilised a diamond core rig to twin OMRC015 at the OMCO Mine site (figure 1)  firstly to try and gain a more detailed understanding of the mineralisation in the vein and secondly to test the feasibility of diamond core drilling in this environment. In the event  recovery issues were encountered  particularly at the anticipated depth of mineralisation  believed to be due to the profoundly shattered and tectonised nature of the OMCO fault in this area Due to the recovery issues in this hole  last year's OMRC015  with a best intercept of 1.52 m at 8.110 g/t  remains the most successful measurement of the unmined portions of the OMCO vein.Rhyolite Dome: is an under-explored target in the southeastern part of the Olympic Gold Project (figure 1)  consisting of a suite of clay-altered andesite volcanics surrounding a rhyolite dome with scattered gold anomalies. Despite a large area of prospective geology and substantial areas of alteration  very few surface samples were taken by previous claim holders and reconnaissance sampling this year has shown that there is a considerable area of surface anomaly. A cluster of eight samples in a valley to the south of the dome structure produced grades ranging from below detection limit (BDL) to 0.187 g/t Au  including three above 0.118 g/t. Four samples from an outcrop 700 m northeast of Rhyolite Dome returned grades ranging from 0.08 - 0.135 g/t Au. These results illustrate the strong prospectivity of the Rhyolite Dome target and will be followed-up with a programme of 146 new samples during the course of this summer. Further Material for Processing: Additional surface dumps at Olympic were bulk sampled  two of which returned appreciable grades of gold as follows: A bulk sample taken from a waste heap located near an adit at the northern end of Trafalgar Hill returned a grade of 5.88 g/t Au from a 13.9 kg sample. This heap has a volume of approximately 60 m 3 . A dump situated southwest of a previously identified coarse stockpile exploration target at the OMCO Mine site returned a grade of 1.413 g/t Au from a 11.2 kg bulk sample. This dump has an approximate volume of 120 m 3 . Seven other dumps returned grades between 0.028 and 0.128 g/t Au. The two higher grade features will be resampled to check the representativity of the results and added to the inventory of materials available for processing by the Company's Western Milling JV  due on stream shortly.Figure 1. Recent grab samples and drillhole at the Olympic claims. Jack Springs (JS Group) The M5 prospect in the southeastern part of the Jack Springs claim group was identified early in the Company's history. It is a gabbro intrusion in limestones and rhyolites  mineralisation being associated with the alteration zone around the gabbro  and forms a prominent northeast trending ridge  standing proud of the surrounding tertiary lavas. The desktop review justified a closer look at M5's potential and five new soil traverses across the northeasterly trend of the M5 ridge have now been conducted. Spacings of 50 m between lines and 15 m between samples on each line were used with 37 samples collected. This sampling was successful  identifying anomalous gold values (>10 ppb Au) in 18 of the samples. Some of the best results included 395  195  148 ppb Au. Three lines to the southwest of the survey area contained most of the anomalous samples and the anomaly is open to the SE  SW and NW. In addition to soil sampling  several grab samples were taken from features of interest. Two  from old workings  were particularly notable and a sample taken from a small pit on the southeastern flank of the M5 hill returned a grade of 1.247 g/t Au. This shows that discrete mineralised structures withpotentially economic grades of gold are present at M5. The majority of the anomalous soil anomalies are up-slope from this single working. Another working on the northeast flank of the hill  120 m away from the nearest soil sample  returned a grade of 0.291 g/t Au  534 g/t Ag  and 0.105% Cu from a malachite-bearing quartz vein sample. This represents the first identification of significant silver results from M5  the previous most silver-rich samples being 24 g/t and 18 g/t in grab samples from the crest of the hill. Three grab samples taken from low topography 500m east of the M5 hill returned anomalous values for Au in the range of 0.018 0.040 g/t  indicating the potential for a far larger zone of prospectivity around the M5 ridge. Three other samples in this vicinity ranged from BDL to 8 ppb Au. During this summer  the soil coverage at M5 will be expanded in the open directions  with 165 samples planned. Further grabs will be taken from altered / veined outcrops. Figure 2. Recent soil and grab samples taken at M5. Rock House Group In an area of historic mines  the claims making up the Rock House group had never previously been explored. Great Western identified the potential mineralisation of the area from satellite imagery and consequently staked claims. In 2019 an initial 100 m x 100 m reconnaissance grid was soil-sampled at Rock House (figure 3)  leading to the identification of several targets  including the Southern Alteration Zone (SAZ)  the Northern Slate Zone (NAZ) and the Eastern Shear Zone (ESZ). The NAZ and ESZ have not been followed up since then  the Company's primary focus being on drilling at the SAZ. First drilling was carried out in 2021. A significant 1.5 km long north-south trending structure extends through the NAZ and to the SAZ  passing close to the best drillhole of 2021 (RHRC006) which intercepted 9.14 m at 1.635 g/t Au from 89.92 m  including 1.52 m at 8.02 g/t Au from 97.5 m.",positive,0.99,0.01,0.0,mixed,0.63,0.04,0.33,True,English,"['Great Western Mining', 'Exploration Update', 'Great Western Mining Corporation PLC', 'prominent northeast trending ridge', 'two higher grade features', 'coarse stockpile exploration target', 'high-grading OMCO gold mine', 'Jack Springs claim group', '800-acre Olympic Gold Project', 'previous claim holders', 'two world wars', 'last two years', 'Jack Springs group', 'diamond core rig', 'clay-altered andesite volcanics', 'Seven other dumps', 'surrounding tertiary lavas', 'Western Milling JV', 'OMCO Mine site', 'first three months', 'Additional surface dumps', 'multiple gold prospects', 'M2 copper prospect', 'thorough desktop review', 'diamond core drilling', 'current exploration activity', 'OMCO Mine area', 'Recent grab samples', '11.2 kg bulk sample', 'Rhyolite Dome target', 'three prospects', '13.9 kg sample', 'OMCO fault', 'gold anomalies', 'West Ridge', '43 grab samples', 'copper targets', 'JS Group', 'surface samples', 'exploration priority', 'surface anomaly', 'OMCO vein', 'dome structure', '53 soil samples', 'eight samples', 'Four samples', '146 new samples', 'Euronext Growth', 'Mineral Jackpot', 'soil sampling', 'Rock House', 'past winter', 'field operations', 'precious metals', 'base metals', 'three areas', '4-year option', 'numerous holes', 'Trafalgar Hill', 'best intercept', 'follow-up holes', 'twin OMRC015', 'detailed understanding', 'recovery issues', 'tectonised nature', 'successful measurement', 'unmined portions', 'southeastern part', 'large area', 'prospective geology', 'reconnaissance sampling', 'considerable area', 'detection limit', 'strong prospectivity', 'northern end', 'M5 prospect', 'Olympic claims', 'substantial areas', 'following update', 'Positive results', 'Drilling History', 'subsequent analysis', 'Hole OMRC015', 'Further Material', 'waste heap', 'approximate volume', 'gabbro intrusion', 'alteration zone', 'appreciable grades', 'GWM', 'Company', '8GW', 'silver', 'Nevada', 'HIGHLIGHTS', 'focus', 'INTRODUCTION', 'work', 'ground', 'total', 'payment', 'May', 'purchase', 'prolific', 'intercepts', 'extension', 'figure', 'mineralisation', 'feasibility', 'environment', 'event', 'depth', '1.52 m', '8.110 g', 'suite', 'scattered', 'cluster', 'valley', 'BDL', '0.118 g', 'outcrop', 'programme', 'course', 'summer', 'Processing', 'adit', '5.88 g', '1.413 g', '120 m', '0.128 g', 'representativity', 'inventory', 'materials', 'drillhole', 'limestones', 'rhyolites', '8.9', '0.187', '0.08', '0.135', '60']",2023-07-10,2023-07-11,marketscreener.com

This serious chronic disease badly affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and has no actual current effective treatment.In addition  BioSenic is working on a next-generation  off-the-shelf  enhanced viscosupplement  JTA  for knee osteoarthritis (OA)  made of a unique combination of mammalian plasma proteins  derivatives of hyaluronic acid (a natural component of synovial fluid in the knee) and a third active component. JTA or some derivatives intend to provide added lubrication and protection to the cartilage of the arthritic joint and to alleviate osteoarthritic pain (OA) and inflammation. In March 2023  after the clinical identification of distinct OA subtypes  BioSenic delivered a new post-hoc analysis of its Phase III JTA-004 trial on knee OA  demonstrating positive action on the most severely affected patient sub-population. This new post-hoc analysis drastically changes the therapeutic profile of the combined components and allows for better patient targeting in future clinical developments. The company  which does not intend to allocate R&D resources to support the clinical development of JTA-004  will focus its R&D and clinical activities on an accelerated development of its autoimmune (ATO/OATO) platform.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAFran√ßois Rieger  PhD  Chief Executive OfficerTel: +33 (0)671 73 31 59investorrelations@biosenic.comInternational Media Enquiries:IB CommunicationsNeil Hunter / Michelle BoxallTel: +44 (0)20 8943 4685neil.hunter@ibcomms.agency / michelle@ibcomms.agencyFor French Investor Enquiries:Seitosei ActifinGhislaine GasparettoTel: +33 (0)1 56 88 11 22ggasparetto@actifin.frCertain statements  beliefs and opinions in this press release are forward-looking  which reflect the Company or  as appropriate  the Company directors‚Äô current expectations and projections about future events.

July 10  2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Legrand¬Æ   a longstanding leader in the innovation and manufacture of electrical wiring devices  has announced the launch of their first Electric Vehicle (EV) Charger for residential applications.""We're about delivering access to power  wherever and however people need it "" states Scott Bausch  VP and General Manager for Legrand's wiring device business. ""With more drivers making the switch to electric vehicles  the need for simple  safe and fast ways to charge EVs at home is growing rapidly. We saw meeting this need as a natural extension of what the Pass & Seymour line has been providing for over a century  as pioneers in electrical safety and a long-trusted manufacturer of receptacles and lighting controls. Our team is excited to be offering an EV charging solution designed with the same safety focus  attention to quality and expert support people have come to expect from our products.""Getting started with Legrand's Plug-In Home Level 2 EV Charger is easy. Simply plug the non-networked unit into a 50A power outlet  indoors or out  and start charging ‚Äì no complicated setup or configuration required. Equipped with a SAE J1772 Connector  the North American standard  the charger works with any electric vehicle (adapter required for Tesla models).Compact yet powerful  Legrand's unit is rated for 40A and provides an output of 9.6kW  making for a considerably faster charge than Level 1 models and taking the EV's battery from 0 to 100% in 8-10 hours. It also delivers an extended range of up to 38 miles per hour of charging.""On top of safety and speed  we also wanted to provide a charger that simply wasn't going to get in the way "" adds Kevin Kohl  Legrand's Director Product Management  User Experiences  who took the lead on this project. ""For many people  their garages and driveways don't have a lot of room to spare. The unit itself is sleek and compact so that it can provide convenient charging access without adding bulk to the space. Its cord is 18' long  so that it can easily reach multiple spots and get where it needs to  but it then easily rolls up and stores on the unit's included hook and holster. Perfect for keeping it tidy and out of the way when not in use.""Energy Star¬Æ Certified for efficiency  Legrand's EV charger can also qualify users for potential rebates and tax credits. Eligibility details can be found on www.energystar.gov .Legrand's Plug-In Home Level 2 EV Charger is available now (US Only).

In contrast  in the following pages  the Company confirms that:The Austrian related-party agreement is contracted on an arm's length basis and reported every year to Auditors.SES-imagotag's Audit Committee is comprised of independent directors with the right mix of skills and experience to oversee the Company's financial reporting process.The independent directors are indeed independent according to the strict criteria of the AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance code  including with their direct and indirect SES-imagotag shares ownership.The SESIM management holding company  which is a common vehicle used by many French listed companies  has been fully disclosed in every aspect since its inception; it advances an alignment of interest for its participants with all shareholders  as well as a genuine entrepreneurial spirit and a long-term commitment  all of which are beneficial to the Company.The terms of the sale of the China JV in September 2022 are aligned with SES-imagotag's interests; the figures reported regarding this entity and this transaction are accurate and consistent with each other.There is no round-trip double-counting transactions between SES-imagotag and the China JV: intercompany transactions are eliminated in the Company's consolidated financial statements.EBITDA figures are consistent and reconciled with consolidated financial statements  prepared under IFRS accounting standards.There are indeed a few typos in the English translations of the URD and Annual Report.The partnership with Wirecard was part of a strategy to digitize the end-to-end shopping journey. Many other large international corporations had partnerships with Wirecard at the time. The comparison with Wirecard's accounting irregularities makes no sense.As already communicated and given the considerable damage caused by this repeated attack  the Company has filed a complaint with the French National Financial Prosecutor[1] in particular  for disseminating false and misleading information. It has also notified the French Financial Markets Authority[2] of the numerous regulation breaches committed by Gotham City.SES-imagotag and its teams once again thank its shareholders for their support in the face of this shameless attempt to destabilize and manipulate the Company's share price. The Company remains fully focused on its customers  its partners  and the implementation of the Vusion ‚Äò27 strategic plan.Corporate GovernanceThe Austrian related-party agreement is contracted on an arm's length basis and is reported every year to auditors.MM. Moosburger and Roessl are not part of the Board of SES-imagotag SA (in contradiction to the incorrect assertion by GC on page 11 of their second publication). They are  in fact  managing directors of SES-imagotag's Austrian subsidiary. Therefore  the so called ‚Äúundisclosed related party agreement‚Äù does not require to be disclosed in the SES-imagotag SA related-party disclosure set out in section 3 of the Annual Report. This Austrian related party agreement is reported every year to the Deloitte auditors in Austria as MM. Roessl and Moosburger are SES-imagotag GmbH (Austrian entity) directors.MM. Moosburger and Roessl fully comply with the personal conflict of interest's declaration according to the Group internal conflict of interest procedure. This procedure is clearly mentioned on page 115 of the 2022 URD[3] in the ESG 2022 key achievements section.The leasing terms were carefully negotiated on an arms' length basis and benchmarked with market prices before signature; the monthly lease price is ‚Ç¨ 12.45/m2 (‚Ç¨ 149/year). The same price is charged to other companies renting spaces in the building. The total annual lease is approx. ‚Ç¨ 400 K.SES-imagotag's audit committee chairwoman independenceGC publication states about Ms. H√©l√®ne Ploix  independent director and Chair of the Audit committee that ‚ÄúWhile having an impressive entrepreneurial track record  as well as presence on many other company's Boards  Ploix appears to have limited experience in audit or financial reporting‚Äù.Such statement is wrong and does not take into account Ms. H√©l√®ne Ploix deep and longstanding experience in finance-related functions  either in management roles or when sitting at the Board of directors and Audit committees of leading listed companies.First of all  Ms. H√©l√®ne Ploix founded a private equity firm  and Chaired its investment committee. Work at a private equity firm typically involves a day-to-day review of potential investment opportunities and the monitoring of the existing portfolio  which includes going into deep details in the Company's financial statements  budget and controlling procedures.Ms. H√©l√®ne Ploix also undertook leading roles with financial or credit institutions  as Chair and Chief Executive Officer of Banque Industrielle et Mobili√®re Priv√©e from 1982 to 1984 and director of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank from 1986 to 1989. During the following 6 years  she served as Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Caisse des D√©p√¥ts et Consignations  in charge of the economic and financial activities and was Chair of CDC Participations  Chair of the Supervisory board of CDC Gestion and Chair of the Caisse Autonome de Refinancement.In addition  Ms. H√©l√®ne Ploix currently is or was Chair or member of the audit committees or member of the Board of directors of companies including some of the largest French listed companies. Ms. Ploix was a member of the Board of directors of BNP Paribas  the first European bank  and a member of the Supervisory board of Publicis  a member of the French CAC 40 index. In addition  Ms. Ploix was the Chair of the Audit Committee of the Swiss company Ferring Pharmaceuticals SA  up to June 30  2023 and has been a director and Chair of the Audit Committee of Sofina  a Belgian listed company.The above experience of Ms. H√©l√®ne Ploix  which is fully disclosed in page 73 of the 2022 URD  clearly shows that she has ‚Äúparticular competences in finance  accounting or auditing‚Äù  in accordance with article L.823-19 of the French Code de commerce and is ‚Äúcompetent in finance or accounting‚Äù  as per paragraph 17.1 of the AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code.GC publication states that ¬´ the disclosure above claims Ploix's ‚ÄúShare ownership: 0‚Äù. We find that highly misleading given that she owns shares via an unusual structure called SESIM (which we discuss further below). ¬ªThe share ownership of Ms. H√©l√®ne Ploix in SESIM (which is not an unusual structure at all  as further discussed below) is properly disclosed in the following parts of the 2022 URD:Paragraph 3.2.4  table showing ‚ÄúSummary of transactions mentioned in article L.621-18-2 of the French Monetary and Financial Code carried out during the 2022 fiscal year‚Äù  page 83 of the 2022 URD: it is mentioned in the sixth line of the table that Ms. H√©l√®ne Ploix subscribed to 154 142 shares issued by SESIM on October 13  2022. This transaction was also disclosed in a declaration made to the French Financial Markets Authority on October 18  2022 and published on the French Financial Markets Authority's website on October 19  2022  pursuant to applicable regulations.Paragraph 7.1.1 ‚ÄúBreakdown of the share capital and voting‚Äù  page 234 of the 2022 URD: it is clearly stated in a footnote to the table showing the breakdown that ‚ÄúSESIM is [‚Ä¶] owned in particular by the Company's management team and certain of its directors (Mr. Brabeck-Letmathe  Mr. Moison  Ms. Johnson  Ms. Ploix)‚ÄùGC publication states that ¬´ Ms. Ploix is listed as an ‚ÄúIndependent‚Äù Director  but her stake in SESL shares  via the SESIM vehicle  seems to ensure that she will be conflicted  especially if SESL were to face an accounting investigation. ¬ªAs stated in sub-paragraph (iv) of paragraph 3.2.1.2 ‚ÄúDirectors‚Äù  page 70 of the 2022 URD (which was approved by the French Financial Markets Authority on May 2  2023 under number R.23-025)  the four independent directors in office at December 31  2022 (including Ms. H√©l√®ne Ploix) fulfill all the independence criteria stipulated by the AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code  as further set out in the table  with tick marks indicating that each of the eight independence criteria is met.In particular  the Board of directors  upon recommendation of the ESG  Nomination and Remuneration committee  considered that criteria 8 relating to the significant shareholder status was met for Ms. H√©l√®ne Ploix. By way of reminder  the AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code stipulates that ‚Äúdirectors representing major shareholders of the Company or its parent company may be considered as independent if these shareholders do not participate in the control of the Company. However  beyond a threshold of 10% of the share capital or voting rights  the Board  on the basis of a report by the ESG  Nomination and Remuneration Committee  systematically examines the qualification of independence  taking into account the composition of the Company's share capital and the existence of a potential conflict of interest‚Äù.Given the relatively limited size of the stake of Ms. H√©l√®ne Ploix in SESIM (i.e. approximately 0.5% of SESIM's share capital)  which itself only owns a minority interest in SES-imagotag at 11.97% (which translates into an indirect stake in SES-imagotag for Ms. H√©l√®ne Ploix of c. 0.06% of the share capital)  it is therefore obvious that (i) Ms. H√©l√®ne Ploix does not ‚Äúparticipate in the control of the Company‚Äù as referred to in the AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance code and (ii) does not cross the 10% threshold set out in the AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance code.The acquisition of 5 000 shares of SES-imagotag on June 27  2023 by Ms. H√©l√®ne Ploix (which represents c. 0.03% of SES-imagotag's share capital and was disclosed to the French Financial Markets Authority on June 29  2023 in accordance with applicable regulations)  does not affect this conclusion. In addition  it has been noted by the Board of directors that the limited value of Ms. H√©l√®ne Ploix's stake in SESIM and SES-imagotag compared to the value of her whole assets allows her to exercise her duties as a director of SES-imagotag regardless of any considerations linked to her financial investment in SESIM and SES-imagotag  which would affect her independence as a director.Such an approach is followed by many French listed companies where directors hold (directly or indirectly) stakes at comparable levels. The holding of shares by directors is also a very common practice and is even encouraged by certain French organizations  such as the Association fran√ßaise de gestion financi√®re (AFG)  which in paragraph 2.4.7 of its recommendations on corporate governance  recommends  that ‚Äúany member of the Board of directors or Supervisory board must hold a minimum (not symbolic) number of shares of the company  as long as local laws allows it‚Äù.GC's statements in this respect are completely incorrect  demonstrating that GC is using any and all means to discredit SES-imagotag's governance.It is reminded that in accordance with the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code  the independence of directors is assessed on an annual basis by the Board of directors of SES-imagotag and upon renewal or appointment of any director.Ms. Cenhui HE  director  and Mr. Franck MOISON  independent directorGC calls into question Ms. Cenhui HE's experience and legitimacy as a member of the Audit committee  arguing that ‚ÄúMs. HE may not be fluent in French and/or IFRS reporting standards. Worse  this BOE-linked member's judgment and/or interests may conflict with SESL's interests  given BOE's multifaceted role as SESL shareholder/supplier/customer/creditor/etc.‚Äù.As is the case for many French listed companies with non-French speakers sitting at their Board of directors and Board committees  the meetings of the Board and its committees are conducted in English (language in which all Board members are perfectly fluent) and all supporting materials are in English.In addition  Ms. Cenhui HE has a strong background in finance roles  gained within the BOE group  which benefits the Audit committee. Ms. Cenhui HE has always demonstrated independent and professional judgment in her role as Audit committee member.As BOE was the controlling shareholder of SES-imagotag until very recently  and still holds a significant stake  the presence of a director appointed by such shareholder at the Board and one of the Board's committees is not unusual in light with the practice followed by French listed companies with controlling or significant shareholder.It is reminded that the composition of the Audit committee is compliant  and has always complied  with the recommendations of the AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code  with at least two thirds of its members being independent directors (in the present case  Ms. H√©l√®ne Ploix and Mr. Franck Moison).GC sees ‚ÄúMr. Franck MOISON facing a similar problem as the audit committee chair  Ploix: he owns SESL shares via the SESIM structure  compromising his independence  in our view‚ÄùIt is reminded that Mr. Franck Moison holds 192 678 shares of SESIM  to which he subscribed on October 13  2022  in the context of a share capital increase of SESIM. This holding of SESIM shares by Mr. Franck Moison has been properly disclosed by the Company in paragraph 3.2.4  page 83 of the 2022 URD (seventh line). This transaction was also disclosed in a declaration made to the French Financial Markets Authority on October 18  2022 and published on the French Financial Markets Authority's website on October 19  2022  pursuant to applicable regulations. In addition  Mr. Franck Moison is clearly identified as a shareholder of SESIM in paragraph 7.1.1 ‚ÄúBreakdown of the share capital and voting‚Äù  page 234 of the 2022 URD: ‚ÄúSESIM is [‚Ä¶] owned in particular by the Company's management team and certain of its directors (Mr. Brabeck-Letmathe  Mr. Moison  Ms. Johnson  Ms. Ploix)‚Äù.As set out in sub-paragraph (iv) of paragraph 3.2.1.2 ‚ÄúDirectors‚Äù  page 70 of the 2022 URD  the Board of directors considered that Mr. Franck Moison fulfills all the independence criteria stipulated by the AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code  as further set out in the table  with tick marks indicating that each of the eight independence criteria is met. In particular  the Board of directors considered that criteria 8 relating to the significant shareholder status was met.The same reasoning as the one applying to Ms. H√©l√®ne Ploix (see above) applies here. Indeed  the limited amount of Mr. Franck Moison's stake in SESIM (i.e. approximately 0 7% of SESIM's share capital)  which itself only owns a minority interest in SES-imagotag at 11.97% (which translates into an indirect stake in SES-imagotag for Mr. Franck Moison of c. 0 083% of the share capital)  shows that (i) Mr. Franck Moison does not ‚Äúparticipate in the control‚Äù of the Company as referred to in the AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code and (ii) does not cross the 10% threshold set out in the AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code. In addition  it has been noted by the Board of directors that the limited value of Mr. Franck Moison's stake in SESIM compared to the value of his whole assets allows him to exercise his duties as a director of SES-imagotag regardless of any considerations linked to his financial investment in SESIM  which would affect his independence as a director.SESIMGC states that ‚ÄúIn our experience as investors  we have never seen management and board members collectively hold their shares in their public company via a pooled  illiquid private vehicle.Usually  management or board members own shares and/or transact directly in their publicly listed shares ¬ª. GC also finds ‚Äúthe large investment management made into SESIM surprising  compared to management's disclosed compensation‚Äù.SESIM (acronym for SES IMAGOTAG MANAGEMENT) is an investment vehicle in SES-imagotag shares  created in 2017 to federate SES-imagotag managers and employees who 1) already heldSES-imagotag shares - from direct market purchases  or from the sale of their start-up  or from past free shares and stock-options plans  and/or 2) wished to invest their own savings in SES-imagotag - possibly by means of a personal bank loan - through this holding company.In this way  managers and employees have jointly created SES-imagotag's second-largest shareholder over the years. At the end of 2022  SESIM held 11.97% of SES-imagotag  i.e. 1 897 837 SES-imagotag shares.In order to strengthen SESIM's position in SES-imagotag's capital  SESIM has also opened up its capital in very minority proportions to a number of people close to the company  i.e. former shareholders of the start-ups it has acquired and a financial partner. SESIM has also taken out bank loans for this purpose.One of SES-imagotag's strengths lies in its strong entrepreneurial dimension  which gives management a long-term vision and creates an alignment of interests between management and shareholders.For someone claiming ‚Äúexperience as investors‚Äù  GC's statement is very surprising and raises serious questions about their professionalism and experience of capital markets.Indeed  the use of a vehicle dedicated to the holding of the management's stake in the company  with the management (and in some cases members of the Board) holding shares in such vehicle  is observed in many SBF 120 French listed companies. As a matter of fact  the use of such vehicle is usually seen as an efficient way of managing the management's stake over time (in particular when the size of such stake is significant  as is the case for SESIM)  especially its liquidity. Indeed  it is perceived by investors as a mean to avoid constant sales on the market by managers (if such managers were to hold shares directly)  which could have a negative impact on the stock price  and allows for managers to be locked-in for a certain period of time (usually until the vehicle is liquidated  except for specific circumstances where shareholders are provided liquidity early). Generally speaking  the structuring of the management's shareholding through this kind of vehicle commits them towards a long-term shareholding  thus ensuring an alignment of their interests with those of investors.In this regard  GC's vision is again completely incorrect and demonstrates their bad faith.The management's investment in and commitments towards the Company is one of the pillars of the Group's strategy  allowing an alignment of interests for the benefit of all stakeholders. The Group also relies on a management team who strongly believes in the Group's strategy and vision  and wishes to support it in the long-term. It is therefore not ‚Äúsurprising‚Äù that the amount invested in SESIM was significant  although invested at a time where the market cap was much lower.SESIM borrowed to buy SESL shares on November 17  2022Although there is no clear grief emerging from this paragraph of GC publication  one can assume between the lines that GC blames SESIM for having financed the purchase of 240 000 shares ofSES-imagotag with a loan secured by a pledge over the SES-imagotag shares held by SESIM  as disclosed in paragraph 3.2.4 of the 2022 URD.Implementing a secured financing for the acquisition of shares of a listed company is a usual practice allowed under French law. Again  GC's judgment is totally disconnected from the way financial transactions are usually structured.Absence of conflict of interest for Independent Board membersGC questions again the independence of Board members invested in SESIM  i.e. Mr. Franck Moison  Ms. H√©l√®ne Ploix  Ms. Candace Johnson and Mr. Peter Brabeck-Letmathe (holding its shares through The Glasshouse SA). GC asserts in particular that ‚Äúwith key independent board members highly invested in SESIM  which itself has pledged shares (for debt)  independent board members of SESL that are invested in SESIM are unlikely able to make tough decisions in the interest of the common shareholder‚Äù.We have already responded above regarding the situation of Mr. Franck Moison and Ms. H√©l√®ne Ploix and the fact that in light of their limited stake in SESIM  the Board of directors has considered that their independence is not affected by such circumstance. The same applies to Ms. Candace Johnson  who holds 19 267 shares in SESIM.Regarding Mr. Peter Brabeck-Letmathe  his investment is made through The Glasshouse SA  both (i) directly  through the holding of 275 435 shares in SES-imagotag (i.e. 1.73% of SES-imagotag share capital)  and (ii) indirectly  through the holding of 1 445 086 shares of SESIM (i.e. 4.47% of SESIM share capital  translating into a 0.53% indirect holding in SES-imagotag).The Board of directors has assessed the independence of Mr. Peter Brabeck-Letmathe pursuant to the criteria set forth in the AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code and in light in particular of his direct and indirect shareholding in SES-imagotag. Based on the recommendation of the ESG  Nomination and Remuneration Committee (on Nov. 25  2022)  the Board of directors concluded that the limited value of Mr. Brabeck-Letmathe's stake in SESIM and SES-imagotag compared to the value of his whole assets allows him to exercise his duties as a director of SES-imagotag regardless of any considerations linked to his financial investment in SESIM and SES-imagotag  which would affect his independence as a director. In addition  the total stake (both direct and indirect  i.e. 2.26%) of The Glasshouse SA inSES-imagotag  although larger than the ones of the other directors  does not grant any control over SES-imagotag and remains below the 10% threshold referred to in the AFEP-MEDEF Corporate Governance Code. As a final point in this matter  the Board of directors has noted the considerable and successful experience of Mr. Brabeck-Letmathe  which brings significant added value to the work of the Board of directors  in support of the ambitious growth strategy of the Company set out in its 2027 VUSION plan.2. Joint-VentureGC claims the following: ‚Äú There's a $10 million discrepancy between SESL and Chinese sources account of the 2019 JV investment.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe 2019 transactions as presented by SESL do not match figures from Chinese sources‚Äù. ‚ÄúEUR 13.867 million is a suspiciously large use of cash for SESL in 2019‚ÄùAt inception  China JV shareholders agreed to inject US$ 30mn in the China JV. The SES-imagotag prorata ownership position was 51% or US$ 15.3mn.A first paid-in capital contribution from all the shareholders was effective in 2019 for US$ 10mn  including US$ 5.1mn (51%) for SES-imagotag.These amounts are entirely consistent with those reported by ‚ÄúChinese sources‚Äù in the column ‚Äúsubscribed capital contribution 15.3 million (USD)‚Äù and the column ‚Äúpaid in capital contribution 5.1 million (USD)‚Äù. The information is therefore fully consistent.The Group did not make a paid-in capital contribution of US$ 15.3mn / ‚Ç¨ 13.8mn in the China JV in 2019.The US$ 10.2mn remaining were paid later by the Group in 2020 and 2021 as agreed in the shareholder agreement.There is no discrepancy between sources  cash balance figures reported are correct and the Group did not inject ‚Ç¨ 13.8mn cash in the China JV in 2019.The JV's divestiture was done on a fair valuation.GCR claims the following: ‚Äú The 2022 JV divestiture makes no sense: why dispose of a growing business for a low price?‚Äù. ‚ÄúIn 2022  the JV's ‚Äúrevenue and profits have steadily increased‚ÄùThe Group already explained the reason for the China JV divestiture in the previous answer referring to GC Part I.It is important to remind shareholders that the revenue growth from the JV was limited and the company had consistently reported losses until its disposal.The valuation of the China JV was set US$ 10mn above the cash injected despite its cumulative losses.It was therefore not a ‚Äúlow price‚Äù but a fair market value  which was confirmed by the fairness opinion issued by an external independent expert.SES-imagotag has no relation whatsoever with the WeChat post mentioned which was published more than 5 months after SES-imagotag exited and deconsolidated the JV. The marketing-oriented WeChat message does not give any financial indication and does not reflect the performance of the Company prior to 2022.GC claims the following: ‚Äú SESL divested its 51% interest in the JV for EUR 13.867 million  the same price it originally purchased the JV‚ÄùThe divestiture from the China JV was a transaction in-kind and not in cash. SES-imagotag sold its stake in the China JV but did not receive cash in return. SES-imagotag sold its stake in the China JV and received YiYun's shares in return.At the time of China JV's divestiture both the valuation of YiYun and China JV were reviewed by an external independent expert which issued a fairness opinion. The valuation of the China JV was set at approx. US$ 40mn for 100% of the company  which is US$ 10mn more than the total cash injection from all the shareholders in this company (US$ 30mn). The valuation of China JV for the transaction is reported in the Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2022 URD and amounts to‚Ç¨ 18 668 K or approx. US$ 20.4mn (US$ 40mn x 51%). It happens to be a figure close to the one corresponding to the cash impact of the China JV deconsolidation  but this is a coincidence  and these figures are unrelated.SES-imagotag did not sell its stake in the China JV for ‚Ç¨ 13.8mn cash. The Group received YiYun shares valued at ‚Ç¨ 18.7mn.Note: there is a typo in the footnote to the Note 3 as the ‚Ç¨ 18.6mn refers to YiYun stake and not to the Japan entity.GC writes the following: ‚Äú At what valuation was BOE YiYun assessed at?‚ÄùAt the time of the transaction  the 51% stake in China JV was exchanged for a 9.5% stake in YiYun which valued YiYun at approx. US$ 200mn.The GC publication refers to two alternative valuations  which are not valid valuation methods of YiYun at the time of the transaction:The ‚Ç¨ 75mn valuation to which GC refers to is the par value of the share capital increase performed to remunerate the contribution of the China JV shares. It omits the value of the premium.The ‚Ç¨ 65mn in BOE books refers to a valuation in 2020 which obviously increased given the performance of YiYun between 2020 and 2022.GC writes the following: ‚Äú How much of BOE YiYun does SESL own: 9.5% or 8.9%?‚ÄùFollowing the transaction with SES-imagotag  YiYun made another capital increase to welcome a new investor. SES-imagotag did not subscribe to this capital increase  which therefore diluted its stake from 9.5% to 8.9% (and was made on the basis of a higher valuation of YiYun).As of December 31  2022  SES-imagotag's stake in YiYun was therefore 8.9%.Cash impact of the JV deconsolidationGC claims the following: ‚Äú We are unable to reconcile the JV's available cash as presented by SESL in its 2022 AR.‚Äù ‚ÄúEUR 13.8 million in cash [at deconsolidation time is] not credible.‚ÄùAt the end of Q3 2022  when the Group deconsolidated the China JV  the balance sheet of this legal entity showed a working capital and a cash position amounting respectively to ‚Ç¨ 4.8mn and ‚Ç¨ 13.8mn. The impact disclosed in the section 5.1.3 of the 2022 URD is the addition of these 2 figures totaling‚Ç¨ 18.6mn.The ‚Ç¨ 13.8mn cash position is reported in the Consolidated statement of cash flows as shown below:It is reminded that this ‚Ç¨ 13.8mn amount does not correspond to the selling price of the 51% stake in the JV China. It is the amount of cash on the balance sheet of the China JV when the Group deconsolidated this entity. It is indeed an impact of change in scope.It also happens to be nearly the same amount as the initial investment of SES-imagotag (i.e. 51% of US$ 30mn = US$ 15.3mn = ‚Ç¨ 13.9mn) but it is pure coincidence  and these two figures are unrelated.The ‚Ç¨ 4.8mn impact from the change in working capital is included in the line ‚ÄúDeconsolidation of the JV and other variations‚Äù. The ‚Ç¨ 3.8mn reported on this line in the note consists of ‚Ç¨ 4.8mn working capital position from the JV account and ‚Ç¨ -1.0mn from ‚Äúother variations‚Äù.The scope of consolidation impact of the deconsolidation of the China JV was therefore in the cash flow statements.Additionally  GC considers the cash balance at the time of deconsolidation should have been higher.Their statement is based on the calculation they made as reported in Appendix to their Part II publication:GC considers that cash flows equal net income. The firm made the same mistake in Part I of their publication  omitting the ‚Ç¨ 4.8mn working capital impact in the case of the China JV.GC claims the following: ‚ÄúWe are unable to reconcile how the Group generated a capital gain in the consolidated financial statements of EUR 6.7 million:- SESL acquired its JV stake for EUR 13.867 million in 2019 and disposed of its JV stake for EUR 13.867 million. It's unclear what the capital gain here is.- If by ‚Äòcapital gain' SESL is referring to the difference in the price it disposed of its JV stake for (EUR 13.867 million) and the price it acquired its stake in BOE YiYun for (EUR 18.669 million)  that difference is EUR 4.8 million  not EUR 6.7 million.‚ÄùAs already stated  the Group did not dispose of its stake in the China JV for ‚Ç¨ 13.8mn.In a transaction in-kind the selling price equals the value of the shares received in exchange of the disposal (in this case ‚Ç¨ 18.668mn).There is only one way to define and calculate a capital gain: it equals the difference between the selling price and the value of the divested company in the books of the seller. When it is measured in the local statutory financial statements of the selling company  the difference is made between the selling price and the value of the divested company in the local statutory financial statements. When it is measured in the consolidated financial statements of the Group  the difference is made between the selling price and the value of the divested company in the consolidated financial statements of the Group.In the stand-alone parent company's statutory financial statement  GC correctly calculated the capital gain (‚Ç¨ 4.8mn)  but in the consolidated financial statements  they failed to understand that the capital gain was higher.The capital gain in the consolidated financial statements also factors in the cumulated results of the company divested over the period when it was consolidated. This explains why the capital gain in the Group's consolidated financial statements is higher than the capital gain in the stand-alone parent company's statutory financial statement. The cumulated losses were already apprehended in the P&L of the Group year after year from 2019 to Q3-2022.The capital gain resulting from the disposal of the 51% stake in the China JV amounts to ‚Ç¨ 6.7mn in the consolidated financial statements.3. BOE / ChongqingGC claims the following: ‚Äú EUR 3.9 million in payments from SESL to JV: are these round-trip revenue?‚ÄùAll inter-company transactions between SES-imagotag and JV are eliminated in the Group's consolidated financial statements.One of the roles of the Joint-Venture has been to identify cost-down opportunities by sourcing some components from Chinese local suppliers (example: e-paper display modules makers). Therefore SES-imagotag has purchased some components from the Joint-Venture. As all inter-company transactions  they are eliminated in the consolidated accounts and are by no means round-trip revenues.The Chongqing exclusivity agreement was in the interest of SES-imagotag .The artificially fabricated controversy around the exclusivity contract reflects GC's lack of understanding of SES-imagotag's supply chain strategy.As part of its industrial partnership with SES-imagotag  BOE had invested in highly automated production lines. SES-imagotag wanted to retain the exclusive benefit of these production lines for a minimum period of time.At the same time  SES-imagotag has continued its multi-sourcing strategy  already widely explained to the market  and has developed partnerships with other high-performing EMS (Electronic Manufacturing Services)  in Vietnam and later in Mexico.Therefore  the contradiction suggested between these different pillars of SES-imagotag's successful supply chain strategy is totally false.The Chongqing exclusivity agreement has not incurred additional debt.GC claims the following: ‚Äú SESL was severely cash-strapped and could not afford to pay without incurring debt.‚ÄùAs stated in the Annual Report  the payment of the exclusivity agreement was fully completed in 2020.There was no additional debt increase because of this payment.According to the IFRS 16 accounting standards  the exclusivity contract has to be accounted for as a financial leasing and disclosed in the financial statements as ‚Äúleasing related debts‚Äù. This reflects only the application of the IFRS16 accounting standard  but it has no impact on cash transactions. Therefore  SES-imagotag still reports it as a leasing contract in the 2022 financial accounts according to IFRS16 application.SES-imagotag Japan K.K was incorporated in 2022 with a capital subscription of ‚Ç¨ 39 000.The Japanese subsidiary was incorporated on January 05th  2022. To this end  SES-imagotag paid the capital of ‚Ç¨ 39 000 on December 27th  2021. Consequently  the investment was published in the 2021 Annual Report as an increase of financial assets  with the following footnote: ‚ÄúIn connection with the subsidiary created in Japan end of December 2021. The activity has started early January 2022‚Äù.In the 2022 URD  there is a typo in the footnote 6 below the note 3 related to financial assets. The amount of ‚Ç¨ 18 668 000 is related to YiYun investment and not Japan's subsidiary investment.4. Other allegationsDeferred revenue and accounts receivableIn the French Annual Report  the amount of trade receivable is ‚Ç¨ 109 247 thousand  the amount of deferred revenue is ‚Ç¨ 10 249 thousand and the amount of other debts and accrual accounts is ‚Ç¨ 91 275 thousand. The financial statements in the Annual Report are correct. There was a typo in the footnote 5 and a typo in the footnote 14 in the English translation of the report.Value-added servicesThe figure reported in the Note 15 to the consolidated income statement is ‚Ç¨ 15mn higher than the Value-added services figure in the Management Report (section 5.1 of the Annual Report) due to the Fixings revenues which are not considered as VAS.2021 goods and services revenuesThe Group first reported in 2022 on the revenue split between goods and services. The 2021 goods revenue figure in the 2022 URD is lower than the figure disclosed in the 2021 URD as it refers to a different scope.2022 EBITDA reconciliation: IFRS 16The cash flow statement disclosed in the section 5.1.3 as management report on financial results  is based on the financial statement before taking IFRS 16 into account. The reconciliation table between the financial operation result and the EBITDA includes IFRS 16. Therefore  there is no inconsistency but a different scope of analysis.Market Hub ownership stake historyThe percentage controlled in 2018 is 60%. This information has been disclosed in the French v Annual Report.

In May  employee figures include the addition of the two acquisitions made by SES-imagotag in 2023  i.e. In the Memory and Belive.ai.Breakdown of COGSThe consolidated income statement format under IFRS is standardized and the Group is reporting under this format in its consolidated financial statements as shown in section I.2 of the URD.A business presentation is made in section 5.1 which shows the variable cost margin.Annual Reports available on websiteSince 2006  all French Annual Reports are available on the website.

One of our top-selling.,NANOBIOTIX Announces License Agreement for Worldwide Co-development and Commercialization of Potential First-In-Class Radioenhancer NBTXR3Details Category: More News Published on Tuesday  11 July 2023 10:16 Hits: 221PARIS  France and CAMBRIDGE  MA  USA I July 10  2023 INANOBIOTIX (Euronext: NANO ‚Äì‚Äì NASDAQ: NBTX ‚Äì the ‚Äò‚ÄòCompany‚Äô‚Äô)  a late-clinical stage biotechnology company pioneering physics-based approaches to expand treatment possibilities for patients with cancer  today announced a global licensing  co-development  and commercialization agreement with Janssen Pharmaceutica NV (‚ÄúJanssen‚Äù)  one of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson  for the investigational  potential first-in-class radioenhancer NBTXR3.NBTXR3 is currently being evaluated in several studies across solid tumor indications including NANORAY-312  a global Phase 3 pivotal study evaluating NBTXR3 for the treatment of patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer. NBTXR3 is also being evaluated for its potential as a systemic agent in combination with anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors for patients with metastatic cancers.Under the terms of the license agreement  in collaboration with the Interventional Oncology R&D Unit at Johnson & Johnson  Nanobiotix will grant Janssen a worldwide license for the development and commercialization of NBTXR3. The license is exclusive  excepting territories previously licensed to Nanobiotix partner LianBio. Dial-in information for a conference call Nanobiotix will host to discuss the agreement can be found below.‚ÄúAs pioneers in the field of nanotherapeutics for the past 20 years  we knew that the true impact of our innovation in oncology would be in its potential to reach millions of patients around the world. For that  we needed to find the right partner  at the right time  with proven global development and commercialization capabilities ‚Äù said Laurent Levy  Nanobiotix chairman of the executive board. ‚ÄúWe are delighted to collaborate with Janssen as we aim to improve the lives of patients with cancer around the world.‚ÄùNanobiotix will receive near term cash and operational support valued up to $60 million. This includes an upfront cash licensing fee of $30 million  and in-kind regulatory and development support for study NANORAY-312 valued at up to $30 million that Janssen may provide at its sole discretion. Nanobiotix will maintain operational control of NANORAY-312 and all other currently ongoing studies  along with NBTXR3 manufacture  clinical supply  and initial commercial supply. Janssen will be fully responsible for an initial Phase 2 study evaluating NBTXR3 for patients with stage three lung cancer and will have the right to assume control of studies currently led by Nanobiotix.Nanobiotix is eligible for success-based payments of up to $1.8 billion  in the aggregate  relating to potential development  regulatory  and sales milestones. Moreover  the agreement includes a framework for additional success-based potential development and regulatory milestone payments of up to $650 million  in the aggregate  for five new indications that may be developed by Janssen at its sole discretion; and of up to $220 million  in the aggregate  per indication that may be developed by Nanobiotix in alignment with Janssen.Following commercialization  Nanobiotix will also receive tiered double-digit royalties on net sales of NBTXR3.‚ÄúWe expect this agreement  and the collaboration it enables  to further drive the expansion of NBTXR3 development and accelerate the realization of its promise for patients in need ‚Äù said Bart van Rhijn  Nanobiotix chief financial officer. ‚ÄúWe look forward to maximizing the value of NBTXR3 for our global stakeholders.‚ÄùSeparately  Nanobiotix is eligible to receive up to $30 million in equity investments from Johnson & Johnson Innovation ‚Äì JJDC  Inc. (‚ÄúJJDC‚Äù) including  as part of capital increases without preferential subscription rights: (1) an initial tranche equal to the lower of 5% of the Company and $5 million; and (2) a second tranche of $25 million subject to certain maximum ownership caps in connection with a future financing.The price of the initial tranche will be equal to $5.21 per American Depositary Share (‚ÄúADS‚Äù) if that price (1) is approved by Nanobiotix shareholders or (2) exceeds 85% of the volume-weighted average price (‚ÄúVWAP‚Äù) of Nanobiotix ordinary shares on Euronext: Paris for three consecutive trading days  starting with the fourth trading day after the date of agreement  in each case if occurring within the ninety trading days following the date f the agreement. Also  JJDC may elect any time during that ninety-trading day period to instead consummate the initial tranche at a price per ADS equal to 85% of the VWAP of Nanobiotix ordinary shares on Euronext for three consecutive trading days starting with the fourth trading day after the date of the agreement. The second  $25 million tranche is conditioned upon  and at the same price as  a concurrent Nanobiotix financing with gross proceeds of at least $25 million (excluding the potential investment by JJDC) occurring prior to certain long-term development milestones or December 31  2027  at the latest.For illustrative purposes only1  in the event that the initial tranche is implemented at $5.21 per ADS  the dilutive impact for shareholders resulting from this capital increase would be 0.97% and JJDC group would own 2.65% of the Company‚Äôs share capital.The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory clearances including clearance by US antitrust authorities under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act  and will become effective as soon as these conditions have been met.As of the date the license agreement becomes effective  prior to utilizing the second tranche of equity investment outlined above and excluding near term development milestones  Nanobiotix expects to extend its cash runway into the first quarter of 2024.The above statements are subject to the assumptions and risks described in the Cautionary Statement section of this press release below.About NANOBIOTIXNanobiotix is a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering disruptive  physics-based therapeutic approaches to revolutionize treatment outcomes for millions of patients; supported by people committed to making a difference for humanity.
