Indeed  since the Covid-19 health crisis  Hong Kong has become the primary art market hub in the entire Asia-Pacific region. This year  however – and for the first time in ten years – Hong Kong is experiencing a slight contraction in its art market activity. Meanwhile  mainland China is slowly returning to a growth path.China’s Fine Art auction turnover Artist Zhang Xiaogang in his studio  with Wan Jie  CEO of the Artron Group (left)  and thierry Ehrmann  President of Artmarket.com and Founder of Artprice (right)thierry Ehrmann  President of Artmarket.com and Founder of Artprice: ""We have had a privileged partnership with the Chinese group Artron for over a decade  and it is this long collaboration that allows our joint reports to identify and analyze the stabilization of China's art market  with an effective reorganization of its market"".Two works fetched over $30 millionAt $33.1 million  on 24 February 2023 in Beijing  Yongle Auction hammered China's best fine art result of H1 for an ink on paper by Cui Ruzhuo  Rafting In Wind And Rain (2019). It was also the best result in mainland China for over five years. But it was only the 18th best fine art auction result in mainland China's auction history  a long way behind the $140 million hammered in 2017 for the 12 drawings that make up Qi Baishi's Screens of Landscapes (1925).In Hong Kong  on 5 April 2023  an ink on paper enhanced with gold by Zhang Daqian  Pink Lotuses on Gold Screen (1973)  was acquired for $32.1 million at Sotheby's. The island still fosters and promotes exchanges between East and West  recording multi-million dollar results for works by Yoshitomo Nara and Yayoi Kusama and works by Pablo Picasso and Jean-Michel Basquiat. At the start of the year  canvases by Miro  Magritte  Zao-Wou-ki  and Chagall naturally blended with sculptures by Jeff Koons and ultra-contemporary works by Matthew Wong  Nicolas Party  and Avery Singer in the finest Hong Kong catalogs.In total  Artprice has detailed data for nearly 16 000 fine art lots sold at auctions throughout China between 1 January and 30 June 2023. Hong Kong retains the highest average fine art lot price in the world (just under $230 000) with 2 600 works generating $595 million (incl. buyer's fees). But mainland China's data is also honorable with over 10 000 lots fetching an average price of $78 000.+180% growth in mainland ChinaWhile the art market is experiencing a sharp contraction in almost all Western countries  mainland China has posted relatively positive figures for H1 2023. Although it is still far from its exceptional performances of ten years ago  the country's fine art auction market generated almost three times more turnover than in H1 2022  which was hampered by the country's zero-covid policy at the time. However  the recent dynamism may have been boosted by sales that were simply rescheduled from last year; so it remains to be seen if the second half will post equally buoyant figures.The performances of Chinese auction houses China Guardian  Poly  Yongle  Rombon  and Xilling have once again become all the more important since Western auction operators are no longer hosting sales in mainland China for the time being. Their sales have been entirely focused on Hong Kong  consolidating a turnover that has been growing steadily over the last two decades.There is little doubt that the international art market is eager to see key works by the superstars of contemporary Chinese art resurface on the market. In H1 we saw several 7-digit results for works by Chen Yifei  Liu Ye  and Zhou Chunya  among others  and Bonhams sold Zeng Fanzhi Mask 2000 No. 3 (2000) for $3.1 million in Hong Kong. This result is consistent with those recorded ten years ago for the same series  but the works of these great names of 'new Chinese painting' have been circulating with much less intensity  and their masterpieces have been surprisingly discreet in auction rooms over the past three years.Images: [https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/07/image1-china-s-fine-art-auction-turnover.png][https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/07/image2-Zhang-Xiaogang-Wan-Jie-thierry-Ehrmann.jpg]Copyright 1987-2023 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to contact our Econometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: econometrics@artprice.comfor your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: econometrics@artprice.com Try our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demo(free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demo Subscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

SNCF Voyageurs  through its internal electricity provider SNCF Energie  will acquire the entire production from a 37.4-megawatt wind farm located in the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region of France. This wind farm  named Rives Charentaises2  consists of 17 wind turbines with an individual capacity of 2.2 megawatts  resulting in a total installed capacity of 37.4 megawatts. The annual production is estimated to be around 78 gigawatt-hours  accounting for 1.4% of SNCF Voyageurs' traction electricity consumption. The commissioning of the wind farm is scheduled for the first half of 2024.This new commitment aligns perfectly with SNCF Voyageurs intention to actively participate in the energy transition. In this context  SNCF Voyageurs confirms its ambition to achieve 40 to 50% renewable energy sources - including 20% from Corporate PPAs - in its electricity consumption mix for train traction by 2026.To achieve this goal  its subsidiary SNCF Energie has been leading the ""Corporate PPA"" program for SNCF Voyageurs since 2018. With these new contracts  by 2027  more than 560 gigawatt-hours per year will come from additional photovoltaic and wind power plants. SNCF Voyageurs aims to have 1 100 gigawatt-hours of renewable electricity from CPPAs by 2027-2028  representing 20% of its electrical needs for train traction.This is not the first collaboration between SNCF Energie and Voltalia. In June 2019  the two companies signed their first large-scale renewable electricity3 direct purchase agreement  covering a capacity of 143 megawatts for a duration of 25 years. Voltalia committed to developing  constructing  and operating three solar power plants located in Gard and Var  France. It was the first agreement of this scale signed between a renewable energy producer and an independent major consumer in France.Sébastien Clerc  CEO of Voltalia  states: ""The signing of this new CPPA reflects the determination of SNCF Voyageurs and Voltalia to pursue an ambitious and proactive common policy regarding the consumption and production of responsible energy. Voltalia is thus assisting its partners in meeting their decarbonisation and low-carbon impact commitments. SNCF Voyageurs and Voltalia share common values by placing Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) at the heart of their strategies and publicly affirming their Purpose: 'Acting for a moving  united  and sustainable society' for SNCF  and 'Improving global environment  fostering local development' for Voltalia.""Richard Fécamp  CEO of SNCF Energie  states: ""This wind CPPA brings real diversification to SNCF Voyageurs' renewable electricity sourcing program. Its negotiation relied on the shared experience of the SNCF Energie and Voltalia teams developed during previous contracts. The decarbonisation is significant  with a carbon content of 14 grams of CO2eq per kilowatt-hour  and the wind production profile complements the profile of the photovoltaic power plants. We are all very proud of this achievement in a challenging economic context for renewable energy production.""Next on the agenda: Q2 2023 turnover  on July 26  2023 (after-market hours)About SNCF VoyageursSNCF Voyageurs is the SNCF Group company dedicated to passenger rail transport.

In particular  smaller budget videogames with limited marketing spend with which to drive the launch and create a consumer base. With a tightening economy  consumers are playing the same games for longer rather than spending on new and different experiences. Attracting gamers to new games IP requires significantly larger marketing investments.The Group has launched  in the period  Crime Boss: Rockay City (launched end of the third quarter  fiscal year). Crime Boss has met expectations and will continue to be supported by recurring drops of additional content. Assetto Corsa continued to outperform expectations and has contributed 24.5 million Euro revenues for the full fiscal year.Alongside the above properties  the Group has also launched (end of Q3 and during Q4) a significant number of new but smaller videogames  these games have not met expected results as originally forecast.This has resulted in revenues significantly below expectations. Actual revenues show a decline of 13.2% compared to the previous fiscal year despite original forecasts. EBIT was previously forecast at the same level as last year (36M Euro). Giving consideration to the above  it is now expected to be in a range between 19 million and 21 million Euro already considering significant write offs related to the videogames recently launched.,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.23,0.2,0.57,True,English,"['Digital Bros S', 'Trade Update', 'FTSE Italia Small Cap index', 'PRESS RELEASE TRADE UPDATE', 'Euronext Tech Leaders', 'limited marketing spend', 'larger marketing investments', 'significant write offs', 'full fiscal year', 'previous fiscal year', 'Digital Bros Group', 'Euronext STAR Milan', 'Current market conditions', 'LAST FISCAL YEAR', 'smaller budget videogames', '24.5 million Euro revenues', 'last year', 'significant number', 'smaller videogames', '36M Euro', 'FY23 GROUP', 'DIB:MI', 'videogames company', 'consumer base', 'tightening economy', 'different experiences', 'The Group', 'Crime Boss', 'Rockay City', 'third quarter', 'recurring drops', 'additional content', 'Assetto Corsa', 'Actual revenues', 'original forecasts', 'same level', '21 million Euro', 'same games', 'FY23 EBIT', 'new games', '116 MILLION', '36 MILLION', '19 million', 'BETWEEN', 'ISIN', 'part', '30 June', 'launch', 'consumers', 'gamers', 'IP', 'period', 'expectations', 'properties', 'Q3', 'results', 'decline', 'consideration', 'range']",2023-07-11,2023-07-12,marketscreener.com

SNCF Voyageurs  through its internal electricity provider SNCF Energie  will acquire the entire production from a 37.4-megawatt wind farm located in the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region of France. This wind farm  named Rives Charentaises2  consists of 17 wind turbines with an individual capacity of 2.2 megawatts  resulting in a total installed capacity of 37.4 megawatts. The annual production is estimated to be around 78 gigawatt-hours  accounting for 1.4% of SNCF Voyageurs' traction electricity consumption. The commissioning of the wind farm is scheduled for the first half of 2024.This new commitment aligns perfectly with SNCF Voyageurs intention to actively participate in the energy transition. In this context  SNCF Voyageurs confirms its ambition to achieve 40 to 50% renewable energy sources - including 20% from Corporate PPAs - in its electricity consumption mix for train traction by 2026.To achieve this goal  its subsidiary SNCF Energie has been leading the ""Corporate PPA"" program for SNCF Voyageurs since 2018. With these new contracts  by 2027  more than 560 gigawatt-hours per year will come from additional photovoltaic and wind power plants. SNCF Voyageurs aims to have 1 100 gigawatt-hours of renewable electricity from CPPAs by 2027-2028  representing 20% of its electrical needs for train traction.This is not the first collaboration between SNCF Energie and Voltalia. In June 2019  the two companies signed their first large-scale renewable electricity3 direct purchase agreement  covering a capacity of 143 megawatts for a duration of 25 years. Voltalia committed to developing  constructing  and operating three solar power plants located in Gard and Var  France. It was the first agreement of this scale signed between a renewable energy producer and an independent major consumer in France.Sébastien Clerc  CEO of Voltalia  states: ""The signing of this new CPPA reflects the determination of SNCF Voyageurs and Voltalia to pursue an ambitious and proactive common policy regarding the consumption and production of responsible energy. Voltalia is thus assisting its partners in meeting their decarbonisation and low-carbon impact commitments. SNCF Voyageurs and Voltalia share common values by placing Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) at the heart of their strategies and publicly affirming their Purpose: 'Acting for a moving  united  and sustainable society' for SNCF  and 'Improving global environment  fostering local development' for Voltalia.""Richard Fécamp  CEO of SNCF Energie  states: ""This wind CPPA brings real diversification to SNCF Voyageurs' renewable electricity sourcing program. Its negotiation relied on the shared experience of the SNCF Energie and Voltalia teams developed during previous contracts. The decarbonisation is significant  with a carbon content of 14 grams of CO2eq per kilowatt-hour  and the wind production profile complements the profile of the photovoltaic power plants. We are all very proud of this achievement in a challenging economic context for renewable energy production.""Next on the agenda: Q2 2023turnover  on July 26  2023 (after-market hours)About SNCF VoyageursSNCF Voyageurs is the SNCF Group company dedicated to passenger rail transport.

Construction is scheduled to begin in the 1st half of 2027. The plant is planned to deliver up to 30 tons of green hydrogen per day into the pipeline of the mosaHYc hydrogen island network. In this way  both partners are making an important contribution to the transformation and future viability of Saarland as an industrial location and the entire Grande Région (Saarland-Lorraine-Luxemburg).Specifically  existing pipelines around Völkingen (Germany)  Carling (France)  Bouzonville (France) and Perl (Germany) are being examined for their suitability as hydrogen pipelines. In addition  the construction of new pipelines from Bouzonville in the direction of Dillingen is planned. Along the mosaHYc pipeline there are a number of industrial consumers who can benefit from the advantages of green hydrogen.""We welcome the fact that the state of Saarland and the city of Perl are focusing on the rapid expansion of a hydrogen infrastructure based on renewable energies. For the construction of the plant  we use state-of-the-art electrolysis technologies with smart software so that the feed-in of electricity from renewable sources can be optimised. The project will make a significant contribution to providing competitive and cost-competitive green hydrogen for industry in Saarland"" says Luc Graré  Head of Central & Eastern Europe at Lhyfe.Hydrogen plays a key role in the decarbonisation of the transport and mobility sector. To achieve the climate targets  capacities must be ramped up nationwide. Projects like the one in Perl prove that close cooperation with municipal decision-makers can make a significant contribution to climate neutrality in industry.Perl's mayor  Ralf Uhlenbruch  welcomes the cooperation and emphasises: ""The Saarland has officially been part of the HyExpert hydrogen model region since August 2020. The planned Lhyfe plant is a significant milestone in the expansion of the regional hydrogen economy. This project is a prime example of the industrial transformation initiated by the EU to supply established industries with green hydrogen  emission-free and across borders. Moreover  it lays the foundation for a new economic sector  new jobs and further important investments in the border triangle. The Lhyfe production facility and the mosaHYc pipeline are only the beginning of a sustainable and innovative development. In the future  our citizens should also be able to benefit directly from the use of hydrogen  for example in local public transport and in the energy supply.""The project's implementation is subject to the granting of operating authorizations and construction permits  as well as to financial investment decisions.For an interview with the spokespersons above  please contact the press department.Click to access the Lhyfe Media Kit (press kit and visuals)About LhyfeLhyfe is a European group devoted to energy transition  and a producer and supplier of green and renewable hydrogen.

In Italy  where only one in ten family businesses survive through to the first generation  we have officially taken the first step on our path of corporate transformation while staying true to our DNA.

In the fast-paced world of global fashion  it's crucial for brands to find suppliers who can deliver both production flexibility and a steadfast commitment to sustainability. This very issue is now deeply woven into the fabric of luxury brand strategies. At Gentili Mosconi  we embrace this challenge wholeheartedly. Our mission is to create beauty without compromise  employing sustainable production processes and partnering with meticulously chosen suppliers who share our unwavering ethical principles. We strive to be more than just a supplier; we aspire to be a hub of culture and excellence - a trusted cornerstone for both supply chains and luxury brands alike.

(NASDAQ: LNZA) signed a Joint Collaboration Agreement to create a new pathway to sustainable ethylene utilizing their combined technologies. Together LanzaTech's carbon capture and utilization technology with Technip Energies' Hummingbird® technology transform waste carbon into ethylene  the most common building block in petrochemicals.Ethylene is a building block for thousands of chemicals and materials  including plastics  detergents  and coatings that keep hospitals sterile  people safe  and food fresh. Its traditional production process is also one of the largest sources of carbon dioxide emissions in the chemical industry and remains one of its most challenging processes to decarbonize. This new joint process uses carbon emissions as the starting point rather than virgin fossil carbon. First  up to 95% of the CO2 in the flue gas is captured from the furnaces of an ethylene cracker and mixed with hydrogen. Next LanzaTech's biorecycling technology transforms the captured waste carbon into ethanol. Finally  Technip Energies' Hummingbird® technology dehydrates the ethanol to ethylene.Technip Energies and LanzaTech have collaborated on other sustainable solutions since 2020  including a partnership with Borealis and On  the Swiss running shoe company  to make EVA foam for the sole of running shoes. Technip Energies also partners with LanzaJet  an independent company formed and spun off by LanzaTech  which includes the Hummingbird® technology in the LanzaJet™ Alcohol-to-Jet process which makes sustainable aviation fuel from ethanol.Arnaud Pieton  CEO of Technip Energies  stated: ""We are very pleased to work with LanzaTech on another sustainable solution  this time to decarbonize ethylene. This breakthrough technology will not only capture carbon but will use it to make a valuable end product.""Dr. Jennifer Holmgren  CEO of LanzaTech  said: ""By combining and integrating our process with that of Technip Energies  we have the potential to retrofit onto ethylene crackers around the world  supporting decarbonization of a sector that has limited choices today. The sustainable production of one of the most used commodity chemicals will have an impact on the lives of billions of people daily. Through partnerships such as this one with Technip Energies  we are creating meaningful pathways to break free from virgin fossil inputs for the things we use in our daily lives.""About Technip EnergiesTechnip Energies is a leading Engineering & Technology company for the energy transition  with leadership positions in Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG)  hydrogen and ethylene as well as growing market positions in blue and green hydrogen  sustainable chemistry and CO2 management. The company benefits from its robust project delivery model supported by extensive technology  products and services offering.Operating in 35 countries  our 15 000 people are fully committed to bringing our client's innovative projects to life  breaking boundaries to accelerate the energy transition for a better tomorrow.Technip Energies is listed on Euronext Paris with American depositary receipts (""ADRs"").

They improve the productivity  flexibility  and environmental footprint of cutting rooms.PARIS  July 11  2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Lectra supports the transformation of fashion  automotive and furniture players by providing them with technological solutions that accelerate their transition to a more efficient and more sustainable Industry 4.0. The Group announces the launch of a new generation of intelligent  connected low-ply equipment for the fashion industry  VectorFashion iX2 and VectorFashion Q2. They are particularly well suited to ensuring a quick  easy transition from small-volume production to larger order volumes  while maintaining optimal cutting quality. Developed with an eco-design approach  their environmental and social impact has been significantly improved.Lectra VectorFashion iX2In fashion  the current trend is towards capsule collections and the constant renewal of products. Manufacturers therefore have to produce smaller volumes of the same design and the number of orders to process and materials to cut is increasing. VectorFashion iX2 and VectorFashion Q2 allow manufacturers to cut variable volumes in an agile manner  in all types of materials.""As economies of scale are increasingly difficult to achieve  fashion manufacturers need to gain flexibility while controlling the costs associated with the production of the orders they receive. With optimized running costs and enhanced performance  the new generation of VectorFashion iX2 and VectorFashion Q2 cutting solutions offers them a better return on investment  and helps them increase their margins while also reducing their environmental footprint. As corporate social responsibility is a major priority for Lectra  we have reinforced the integration of eco-design principles in the development of this new range. This enables our customers to meet the fashion industry's two major challenges: reducing energy and material consumption "" explains Maximilien Abadie  Chief Product Officer at Lectra.A reduced environmental footprintFashion players also have increasingly high expectations regarding the environmental footprint of their business. Lectra meets their needs by applying eco-design principles. VectorFashion iX2 and VectorFashion Q2 use 30% to 40% less energy than the previous versions  which were already renowned for their energy performance  for superior efficiency. They weigh 200 kg less than their predecessors  and are more compact in size. As a result  the carbon footprint associated with transporting the equipment  and with the resources used in its production and maintenance  is also significantly reduced.Ergonomics and operator protection  Lectra's key concerns  have been completely reconsidered  with the introduction of new standards for electronic cards  the integration of motion detection radars  and the reduction of equipment noise levels. This guarantees optimum operator comfort and safety  while minimizing equipment downtime.More connectivity  more intelligence  more efficiencyVectorFashion iX2 and VectorFashion Q2 offer a high level of connectivity thanks to numerous built-in sensors  which makes them fully compatible with Industry 4.0.Thanks to data intelligence and improved connectivity  manufacturers have all the data they need to increase the efficiency of their processes  boost productivity  improve product quality and better meet the challenges of tomorrow.They also benefit from new associated services  as well as predictive maintenance with enriched digital content for greater autonomy. Maintenance operations are halved  resulting in lower consumable costs  and a significant increase in equipment availability compared to the previous generation.About Lectra:As a major player in the fashion  automotive and furniture markets  Lectra contributes to the Industry 4.0 revolution with boldness and passion by providing best-in-class technologies.The Group offers industrial intelligence solutions - software  equipment  data and services - that facilitate the digital transformation of the companies it serves.

These positive trends made it possible to largely offset the contraction in the IT outsourcing activities and the withdrawal from South Africa.Alongside this  its flexible organization and streamlined cost structure enabled the Group to further strengthen its agility and turn around its profitability.Lastly  the financing set up with the issue of ORNAN bonds redeemable in cash and/or new shares has enabled the Group to cover its short and medium-term cash requirements  while supporting the strengthening of its financial structure.EarningsThe Group's full-year revenues at March 31  2023 climbed to €20.6m  with +12.3% year-on-year growth (+13.4% at constant exchange rates). Specifically  this progress reflects a robust second-half performance (+9.8% compared with the first half of the year)  driven by the development of the technology division (+24.2% compared with the first half of the year).The Group would like to confirm that the growth reported in the press release from May 15  2023 (+15.6%) was incorrect due to a reporting error with revenues for the previous year. For FY 2022-23  the Digital division (€11.9m; 58% of consolidated revenues) is up +12.9% year-on-year. The technology division (€8.7m; 42% of consolidated revenues) recorded year-on-year growth of +11.6%. International operations represent 25.7% of the Group's business.Current operating income came to -€0.3m  compared with -€0.9m at March 31  2022. It broke even for the second half of the year (H1 : -€0 3m; H2 : €0m). The increase in the gross margin in a context of stronger value-added growth and the effective management of overheads  which were reduced by -40% over the last three years  are the main factors behind this improvement in operational profitability.Both business segments  Digital and Technology  improved their results over the full year. Profit from recurring operations was positive by €0.1m for the Digital division (+€0.5m on the previous year) and by €0.3m for the Technology division (+€0.2m on the previous year).€m 2022-23 2021-22 Digital Technology Holding march-23 Digital Technology Holding march-22 Revenues 11.9 8.7 20.6 10.6 7.8 18.3 Current operating income 0.1 0.3 (0.7) (0.3) (0.4) 0.0 (0.5) (0.9) % of revenues 1.1% 3.1% - (1.3)% (3.9)% 0.6% - (4.8)%Net income (Group share) was impacted by €(0.3)m of non-recurring costs  linked in particular to the early exit from the lease in Trappes following the deconsolidation of the company Etud Intégral in 2021  and €(0.2)m of provisions for liabilities. It shows a -€0.8m loss  compared with -€1.3m at March 31  2022.Financial positionShareholders' equity (Group share) at March 31  2023  after factoring in earnings for the year  totaled +€2.8m  compared with +€1.6m the previous year. It includes a total of €2.2m for the capital increases carried out through the conversion of 220 ORNAN bonds[1] issued in connection with the financing agreement set up on September 30  2020. This financing also enabled the Group to repay part of its debt.The Group's net financial debt at March 31  2023 totaled €6.5m  compared with €7.6m at March 31  2022  down -14.6%. Cash and cash equivalents totaled €0.6m  down -€0.2m from the previous year.Gross financial debt includes €3.5m of debt linked to the Eolen Group's acquisition (put and vendor loan)  €1.9m for the factoring advance  €0.7m of bank debt (including overdrafts) and €0.5m for the restatement of lease charges  in addition to 30 ORNAN bonds and 37 convertible bonds for €0.3m and a €0.2m partner current account[2]. The Company estimates that its business plan and its effective management of fixed costs will enable it to cover its cash requirements for the next 12 months.In addition  on May 12  the Group set up new financing with an ORNAN bond issue for a maximum nominal total of €10m  in accordance with the delegation of authority granted to the Board of Directors by the Shareholders' Meeting on September 29  2022 under the terms of its 17th resolution. These additional potential financial resources  without any drawdown requirements  will also make it possible to finance external growth operations  if required  as well as investments in organic growth. Under the delegation granted to it  the Board of Directors decided on June 27 to draw down a first tranche of ORNAN bonds for a total of €0.25m.OutlookThe Group is continuing to move forward with its development strategy  combining technology and digital  in order to drive convergence across its two business lines  offer strategic differentiation  further strengthen its positions on its growing markets - telecommunications  transport  IT – and respond to the new challenges linked to the digital  ecological and energy transformation of organizations and businesses.Alongside this  the Group is moving forward with the diversification of its business model  capitalizing on technological alliances and commercial partnerships  especially in France  Israel and Brazil  to market new smart products and services with strong potential  focusing in particular on the smart city market (smart traffic systems  smart public lighting  internet of things  etc.).With the innovative mindset that has guided the Group since it was founded  its expert management of major projects  and its ability to drive progress with new technological companies  the Group is looking ahead to the future with confidence. The improvement in its results and the strengthening of its financial structure confirm the relevance of the strategic plan implemented  including gains on several markets and the higher billing rates  aligned with the premiumization of the services offered.For FY 2023-24  in a still uncertain economic environment  the Group is setting itself objectives to continue building on its organic revenue growth and further improve its operational profitability.Additional informationThe statutory auditors have completed the audit procedures on the corporate and consolidated accounts.

In terms of technology offerings  we announced two new products: our new data management platform  ngenea®2  which fully enhances the power of our processors; and the next generation of our DPU processor  Coolidge™2.We're at a time of increasing awareness of the importance of technologies like AI  and a recognition of the huge market potential for processors such as ours that make implementing these technologies possible. With these headwinds  Kalray continues to strive to become the European leader in data intensive processing solutions. For 2023  we confirm our growth target and our objective to improve results  while continuing to invest for the future.""CONSOLIDATED REVENUE UP 219% AS A RESULT OF STRONG SALES MOMENTUMIn the first half of 2023  Kalray posted consolidated revenue of €15.3M  as compared to €4.8M a year earlier[1]  a sharp increase of 219% that demonstrates strong sales momentum in storage markets (media  artificial intelligence  health and scientific research).Consolidated revenue can be broken down as follows: United States (52%)  Europe including the United Kingdom (46%)  and other countries (2%). The hardware/software breakdown remains relatively constant with 2/3 of revenue coming from software and 1/3 coming from hardware.MAJOR MEDIA CONTRACTKalray continues to roll out its storage and data management solutions  which combine its ""historical"" hardware offering based on DPU processors with software offerings. This puts Kalray in a strong position to respond to the storage and data intensive processing needs of today's enterprises and large organizations.As such  Kalray signed its first major contract with a US leader in the entertainment industry for the newly announced ngenea®2. This new solution simplifies and accelerates extremely complex workflows across the organization and provides a single high-performance access point for all multimedia content distributed across multiple sites.The contract covers both Kalray's software solutions and its fast DPU-based storage offering and represents several million euros in revenue for the year 2023.STRENGTHENED PARTNERSHIP WITH DELL TECHNOLOGIESSimilarly  Kalray's partnership with Dell Technologies  entered into as part of the Extended Technologies Complete (ETC) program and offering end user customers combined Dell/Kalray solutions  has been strengthened.In the first six months of the year  Kalray booked several million euros in revenue from this partnership and expects sales activity to ramp up in the second half of the year as a result of sales cycles. Orders which have  to date  principally been made in the United States could represent several hundreds of thousands of euros per client.NEW PRODUCT OFFERINGS MEET MARKET DEMAND TO SUPPORT INCREASINGLY COMPLEX DATA INTENSIVE STORAGE AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SOLUTIONSSeveral new products were launched in the first half of 2023.In April  Kalray announced its second generation data management platform  ngenea®2  which further extends its offering and opens up new sales opportunities. The ngenea®2 platform  which has already enjoyed its first major commercial success (see above)  can be used with the performance of Kalray's DPUs to offer optimally efficient storage solutions.In parallel  Kalray showcased its new high-performance NVMe Tier-0 solution  based on Kalray's DPU acceleration boards and Dell Technologies' servers  at Dell Technologies World (DTW). Designed for data-intensive workloads and applications  this solution offers unique benefits in terms of performance per watt and performance per euro.Kalray also recently announced the production launch of its Coolidge™2 DPU processor  which will deliver computing performance up to 10 times better than the previous version[2]. Coolidge™2 has been specifically optimized to supplement Kalray's current range of NVMe storage solutions and to meet the needs of new edge computing and AI applications.Coolidge™2 will be included in Kalray's existing ""jumbo contract”[3]. This previously announced contract is proceeding as planned. The qualification phase for the high-performance board that includes four Kalray MPPA® DPU Coolidge™2 processors is scheduled to be complete by the end of fiscal year 2023 and represents an initial tranche of $1M ($500K of which is to be booked in the second half of 2023). As has been communicated in prior updates  this contract offers Kalray potential sales of several tens of millions of euros per year beginning in 2025.Discussions are being held in parallel with other major customers about contracts with similar potential levels of revenue and that could accelerate growth over the coming years.RECOGNITION OF KALRAY'S SOVEREIGN TECHNOLOGY AND PUBLIC FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR THE NEXT GENERATION OF PROCESSORS FOR THE FAST-GROWING AI AND EDGE COMPUTING MARKETSIn May 2023  Kalray announced that it had secured support from the French government as a result of the IP-CUBE[4] project  led by Kalray  and was selected for the ""France Relance 2030 - Future Investments"" plan related to the artificial intelligence acceleration strategy. This project seeks to meet new technological challenges (high performance  low power consumption  low latency  and security) and aims to create the foundations of a French semiconductor ecosystem in the fields of edge computing and embedded AI  based on the national leaders in the field  namely Arteris  Kalray  Secure-IC  and Thales. Kalray will receive funding of €10M to support its next-generation Dolomites™ DPU processor.In parallel  Kalray announced that it had been selected for the French Tech 2030[5] program  aimed at encouraging the development of breakthrough innovations that meet the challenges of society and sovereignty. Kalray's innovative MPPA® DPU[6] high-performance  low-power processor optimized for artificial intelligence  next-generation data centers and 5G will benefit from this initiative. The winners also benefit from enhanced support for France 2030 public financing in conjunction with Bpifrance.ONGOING INVESTMENT - 2023 TARGETS CONFIRMED: REVENUE OF €40M AND IMPROVEMENT IN EBITDAIn fiscal year 2023  Kalray continues to build its management  sales  and sales support teams as part of its ongoing commitment to structure the company for future growth. Kalray is also continuing recruitment and investment in its new ""Dolomites"" generation of processors (partly funded by the IP-Cube project)  which is expected to be released at the end of 2025.From a financial perspective  Kalray confirms its 2023 revenue target of €40M with expected strong acceleration in the second half of the year  as announced at the start of the financial year  and an improvement in EBITDA.Next financial meeting: 2023 half-year results  September 21  2023ABOUT KALRAYKalray is a leading provider of hardware and software technologies and solutions for high-performance  data-centric computing markets  from cloud to edge.

They improve the productivity  flexibility  and environmental footprint of cutting rooms.PARIS  July 11  2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Lectra supports the transformation of fashion  automotive and furniture players by providing them with technological solutions that accelerate their transition to a more efficient and more sustainable Industry 4.0. The Group announces the launch of a new generation of intelligent  connected low-ply equipment for the fashion industry  VectorFashion iX2 and VectorFashion Q2. They are particularly well suited to ensuring a quick  easy transition from small-volume production to larger order volumes  while maintaining optimal cutting quality. Developed with an eco-design approach  their environmental and social impact has been significantly improved.Lectra VectorFashion iX2In fashion  the current trend is towards capsule collections and the constant renewal of products. Manufacturers therefore have to produce smaller volumes of the same design and the number of orders to process and materials to cut is increasing. VectorFashion iX2 and VectorFashion Q2 allow manufacturers to cut variable volumes in an agile manner  in all types of materials.""As economies of scale are increasingly difficult to achieve  fashion manufacturers need to gain flexibility while controlling the costs associated with the production of the orders they receive. With optimized running costs and enhanced performance  the new generation of VectorFashion iX2 and VectorFashion Q2 cutting solutions offers them a better return on investment  and helps them increase their margins while also reducing their environmental footprint. As corporate social responsibility is a major priority for Lectra  we have reinforced the integration of eco-design principles in the development of this new range. This enables our customers to meet the fashion industry's two major challenges: reducing energy and material consumption "" explains Maximilien Abadie  Chief Product Officer at Lectra.A reduced environmental footprintFashion players also have increasingly high expectations regarding the environmental footprint of their business. Lectra meets their needs by applying eco-design principles. VectorFashion iX2 and VectorFashion Q2 use 30% to 40% less energy than the previous versions  which were already renowned for their energy performance  for superior efficiency. They weigh 200 kg less than their predecessors  and are more compact in size. As a result  the carbon footprint associated with transporting the equipment  and with the resources used in its production and maintenance  is also significantly reduced.Ergonomics and operator protection  Lectra's key concerns  have been completely reconsidered  with the introduction of new standards for electronic cards  the integration of motion detection radars  and the reduction of equipment noise levels. This guarantees optimum operator comfort and safety  while minimizing equipment downtime.More connectivity  more intelligence  more efficiencyVectorFashion iX2 and VectorFashion Q2 offer a high level of connectivity thanks to numerous built-in sensors  which makes them fully compatible with Industry 4.0.Thanks to data intelligence and improved connectivity  manufacturers have all the data they need to increase the efficiency of their processes  boost productivity  improve product quality and better meet the challenges of tomorrow.They also benefit from new associated services  as well as predictive maintenance with enriched digital content for greater autonomy.

Those posted a 128% increase in volume over the first six months of the year compared with the first half of 2022. In value terms  gross sales of Sibnayal® rose by 51% over the same period to 0.96 million euros (vs. 0.64 million euros in first-half 2022). Sibnayal® became the Group's leading product  ahead of Likozam® and Levidcen® with sales of 0.93 and 0.33 million euros respectively. Overall  gross sales for the Neurology franchise (Likozam® and Levidcen®) rose by more than 8% over the period.The discrepancy between growth in value and volume is largely due to the implementation of partnerships and the transfer pricing structure. A more detailed analysis of sales shows an acceleration in half-yearly growth in both volume and value.Gross sales (m€) S1 2023 S1 2022 Growth Sibnayal® 0 96 0 64 +51% Neurology 1 26 1 17 +8% of which Likozam® 0 93 0 87 +11% of which Levidcen® 0 33 0 30 +7% Total 2 22 1 80 +23%Didier Laurens  Chief Executive Officer of Advicenne  commented: ""The first half of 2023 saw the implementation of our partnerships throughout Europe  and their first results. This first half is in line with our expectations  with more and more patients being treated across Europe and beyond; and very limited drop-out. It fits with our mission to meet unmet medical needs in rare diseases with drugs that significantly improve the daily lives of patients and their families.”Sibnayal® achievements and prospects in Europe:Setting up marketing structures in the UK and France: these are beginning to bear fruit. In the UK  although negotiations with hospitals are taking time  several agreements with major hospitals were signed in the first half of the year  with more to follow in the second half. In France  the number of hospitals to be supplied has risen significantly  reflecting the growing distribution of the product across the country; to date  Sibnayal® has been delivered to 76 hospitals.Continued deployment of commercial partnerships in the rest of Europe: all partners  including the most recently signed  are now recording sales in their respective geographic zones  particularly in Germany  Denmark  and certain Eastern European countries. The first sales have also been recorded in the Middle East  thanks to the implementation of early access programs.First publication of long-term results for ADV7103 in the treatment of distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA): presented at the European Renal Association congress in Milan  these 72-month follow-up results for patients treated with ADV7103 enabled European doctors specializing in rare kidney diseases to assess the benefits of the drug in this indication.About AdvicenneAdvicenne (Euronext: ALDVI) is a specialty pharmaceutical company founded in 2007  specializing in the development of innovative treatments in Nephrology.
