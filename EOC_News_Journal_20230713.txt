Sanctio…,"MOSCOW  July 12 (Reuters) - One of Russia's oldest asset managers  First AM  has filed a claim for 184.8 billion roubles ($2.04 billion) with the Moscow Arbitration Court against Euroclear Bank  court documents showed  trying to protect investors whose assets were frozen.Sanctions on Russia's National Settlement Depository (NSD)  as well as other Western measures aimed at restricting Russia's access to global financial infrastructure  have blocked many Russian investors' access to securities held in jurisdictions outside Russia.First AM  formerly known as Sber Asset Management  had 1.44 trillion roubles in assets under management as of September 2022. It said it was trying to use every available opportunity to protect its clients' interest.""We have filed a lawsuit...to protect the rights and interests of our clients  whose assets were frozen "" First AM told Reuters. ""The defendant is the European central depositary Euroclear. In 2022  it blocked Russian investors' operations on assets which were accounted for in the NSD account.""Belgium-based Euroclear did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Euroclear has previously said various counterparties from Russia have turned to the courts in Russia and the European Union to challenge it in a bid to recover frozen payments. The Kremlin says Russia and its entrepreneurs have been robbed by Western asset freezes.In case these lawsuits have any material impact  the company has said it had decided to separate its sanctions-related earnings from its underlying financial results when evaluating its own performance and resources.Euroclear  a core part of the global securities settlement system  posted a record year in 2022 after cutting ties with Russian customers  boosted by interest on Russian cash that it is holding.Late last year  First AM applied to European authorities to unblock its assets at Euroclear and Clearstream. It has also applied to the finance ministries of Belgium and Luxembourg directly.($1 = 90.5500 roubles) (Reporting by Elena Fabrichnaya and Alexander Marrow; Editing by Sharon Singleton)",neutral,0.01,0.78,0.22,negative,0.0,0.18,0.82,True,English,"['Russian asset manager', '$2 bln Euroclear lawsuit', 'Moscow', 'global securities settlement system', ""many Russian investors' access"", 'National Settlement Depository', 'global financial infrastructure', 'oldest asset managers', 'other Western measures', 'Western asset freezes', 'underlying financial results', ""Russian investors' operations"", 'European central depositary', 'Sber Asset Management', 'Moscow Arbitration Court', 'Russian customers', 'Russian cash', 'court documents', 'European Union', 'European authorities', 'First AM', 'available opportunity', 'various counterparties', 'frozen payments', 'The Kremlin', 'material impact', 'sanctions-related earnings', 'core part', 'record year', 'finance ministries', 'Elena Fabrichnaya', 'Alexander Marrow', 'Sharon Singleton', '184.8 billion roubles', '1.44 trillion roubles', 'NSD account', 'Euroclear Bank', 'Belgium-based Euroclear', ""clients' interest"", '90.5500 roubles', 'Reuters', 'claim', 'assets', 'jurisdictions', 'September', 'lawsuit', 'rights', 'interests', 'defendant', 'request', 'comment', 'courts', 'bid', 'entrepreneurs', 'case', 'company', 'performance', 'resources', 'Clearstream', 'Luxembourg', 'Editing']",2023-07-12,2023-07-13,marketscreener.com

Indeed  since the Covid-19 health crisis  Hong Kong has become the primary art market hub in the entire Asia-Pacific region. This year  however – and for the first time in ten years – Hong Kong is experiencing a slight contraction in its art market activity. Meanwhile  mainland China is slowly returning to a growth path.China's Fine Art auction turnoverhttps://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/07/image1-china-s-fine-art-auction-turnover.pngArtist Zhang Xiaogang in his studio  with Wan Jie  CEO of the Artron Group (left)  and thierry Ehrmann  President of Artmarket.com and Founder of Artprice (right)https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/07/image2-Zhang-Xiaogang-Wan-Jie-thierry-Ehrmann.jpgthierry Ehrmann  President of Artmarket.com and Founder of Artprice: “We have had a privileged partnership with the Chinese group Artron for over a decade  and it is this long collaboration that allows our joint reports to identify and analyze the stabilization of China's art market  with an effective reorganization of its market”.Two works fetched over $30 millionAt $33.1 million  on 24 February 2023 in Beijing  Yongle Auction hammered China's best fine art result of H1 for an ink on paper by Cui Ruzhuo  Rafting In Wind And Rain (2019). It was also the best result in mainland China for over five years. But it was only the 18th best fine art auction result in mainland China's auction history  a long way behind the $140 million hammered in 2017 for the 12 drawings that make up Qi Baishi's Screens of Landscapes (1925).In Hong Kong  on 5 April 2023  an ink on paper enhanced with gold by Zhang Daqian  Pink Lotuses on Gold Screen (1973)  was acquired for $32.1 million at Sotheby's. The island still fosters and promotes exchanges between East and West  recording multi-million dollar results for works by Yoshitomo Nara and Yayoi Kusama and works by Pablo Picasso and Jean-Michel Basquiat. At the start of the year  canvases by Miro  Magritte  Zao-Wou-ki  and Chagall naturally blended with sculptures by Jeff Koons and ultra-contemporary works by Matthew Wong  Nicolas Party  and Avery Singer in the finest Hong Kong catalogs.In total  Artprice has detailed data for nearly 16 000 fine art lots sold at auctions throughout China between 1 January and 30 June 2023. Hong Kong retains the highest average fine art lot price in the world (just under $230 000) with 2 600 works generating $595 million (incl. buyer's fees). But mainland China's data is also honorable with over 10 000 lots fetching an average price of $78 000.+180% growth in mainland ChinaWhile the art market is experiencing a sharp contraction in almost all Western countries  mainland China has posted relatively positive figures for H1 2023. Although it is still far from its exceptional performances of ten years ago  the country's fine art auction market generated almost three times more turnover than in H1 2022  which was hampered by the country's zero-covid policy at the time. However  the recent dynamism may have been boosted by sales that were simply rescheduled from last year; so it remains to be seen if the second half will post equally buoyant figures.The performances of Chinese auction houses China Guardian  Poly  Yongle  Rombon  and Xilling have once again become all the more important since Western auction operators are no longer hosting sales in mainland China for the time being. Their sales have been entirely focused on Hong Kong  consolidating a turnover that has been growing steadily over the last two decades.There is little doubt that the international art market is eager to see key works by the superstars of contemporary Chinese art resurface on the market. In H1 we saw several 7-digit results for works by Chen Yifei  Liu Ye  and Zhou Chunya  among others  and Bonhams sold Zeng Fanzhi Mask 2000 No. 3 (2000) for $3.1 million in Hong Kong. This result is consistent with those recorded ten years ago for the same series  but the works of these great names of ‘new Chinese painting' have been circulating with much less intensity  and their masterpieces have been surprisingly discreet in auction rooms over the past three years.Images: [ https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/07/image1-china-s-fine-art-auction-turnover.png ][ https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/07/image2-Zhang-Xiaogang-Wan-Jie-thierry-Ehrmann.jpg ]Copyright 1987-2023 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to c ontact our E conometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: econometrics@artprice.comTry our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demoSubscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

Indeed  since the Covid-19 health crisis  Hong Kong has become the primary art market hub in the entire Asia-Pacific region. This year  however – and for the first time in ten years – Hong Kong is experiencing a slight contraction in its art market activity. Meanwhile  mainland China is slowly returning to a growth path.China’s Fine Art auction turnover Artist Zhang Xiaogang in his studio  with Wan Jie  CEO of the Artron Group (left)  and thierry Ehrmann  President of Artmarket.com and Founder of Artprice (right)thierry Ehrmann  President of Artmarket.com and Founder of Artprice: ""We have had a privileged partnership with the Chinese group Artron for over a decade  and it is this long collaboration that allows our joint reports to identify and analyze the stabilization of China's art market  with an effective reorganization of its market"".Two works fetched over $30 millionAt $33.1 million  on 24 February 2023 in Beijing  Yongle Auction hammered China's best fine art result of H1 for an ink on paper by Cui Ruzhuo  Rafting In Wind And Rain (2019). It was also the best result in mainland China for over five years. But it was only the 18th best fine art auction result in mainland China's auction history  a long way behind the $140 million hammered in 2017 for the 12 drawings that make up Qi Baishi's Screens of Landscapes (1925).In Hong Kong  on 5 April 2023  an ink on paper enhanced with gold by Zhang Daqian  Pink Lotuses on Gold Screen (1973)  was acquired for $32.1 million at Sotheby's. The island still fosters and promotes exchanges between East and West  recording multi-million dollar results for works by Yoshitomo Nara and Yayoi Kusama and works by Pablo Picasso and Jean-Michel Basquiat. At the start of the year  canvases by Miro  Magritte  Zao-Wou-ki  and Chagall naturally blended with sculptures by Jeff Koons and ultra-contemporary works by Matthew Wong  Nicolas Party  and Avery Singer in the finest Hong Kong catalogs.In total  Artprice has detailed data for nearly 16 000 fine art lots sold at auctions throughout China between 1 January and 30 June 2023. Hong Kong retains the highest average fine art lot price in the world (just under $230 000) with 2 600 works generating $595 million (incl. buyer's fees). But mainland China's data is also honorable with over 10 000 lots fetching an average price of $78 000.+180% growth in mainland ChinaWhile the art market is experiencing a sharp contraction in almost all Western countries  mainland China has posted relatively positive figures for H1 2023. Although it is still far from its exceptional performances of ten years ago  the country's fine art auction market generated almost three times more turnover than in H1 2022  which was hampered by the country's zero-covid policy at the time. However  the recent dynamism may have been boosted by sales that were simply rescheduled from last year; so it remains to be seen if the second half will post equally buoyant figures.The performances of Chinese auction houses China Guardian  Poly  Yongle  Rombon  and Xilling have once again become all the more important since Western auction operators are no longer hosting sales in mainland China for the time being. Their sales have been entirely focused on Hong Kong  consolidating a turnover that has been growing steadily over the last two decades.There is little doubt that the international art market is eager to see key works by the superstars of contemporary Chinese art resurface on the market. In H1 we saw several 7-digit results for works by Chen Yifei  Liu Ye  and Zhou Chunya  among others  and Bonhams sold Zeng Fanzhi Mask 2000 No. 3 (2000) for $3.1 million in Hong Kong. This result is consistent with those recorded ten years ago for the same series  but the works of these great names of 'new Chinese painting' have been circulating with much less intensity  and their masterpieces have been surprisingly discreet in auction rooms over the past three years.Images: [https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/07/image1-china-s-fine-art-auction-turnover.png][https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/07/image2-Zhang-Xiaogang-Wan-Jie-thierry-Ehrmann.jpg]Copyright 1987-2023 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to contact our Econometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: [email protected]for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: Try our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demo(free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demo Subscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

Of the order amount  around two million euros will be recognized as revenue in the current fiscal year  with the remaining sum being recognized as revenue at the beginning of 2024.The fuel cells are used by BauWatch in camera towers  which are mainly used for monitoring construction sites. The camera systems can be used to remotely monitor the progress of the construction project in real-time while increasing protection against criminal activity. Furthermore  BauWatch's security applications are also used for wind farms  solar parks and infrastructural projects. For power supply  one camera tower is equipped with batteries and solar panels respectively. As an intelligent power generator  the EFOY Pro fuel cell monitors the battery's state of charge and switches itself on fully automatically when the voltage drops due to weather-related influences in order to continuously recharge the battery. The fuel cell then switches back to standby mode. This happens maintenance-free  for weeks without user intervention  and reduces operating costs to a minimum. Thus  SFC Energy's energy solution ensures uninterrupted transmission of the camera system around the clock. The power generation is absolutely environmentally friendly. Compared to commonly used diesel generators  the EFOY Pro fuel cells do not emit any environmentally harmful exhaust gases such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) or carbon monoxide (CO) and no particulate matter.“BauWatch has been a partner and customer of SFC Energy for more than 10 years. The renewed order shows that the partnership is continuing to bear fruit in the future. The EFOY Pro fuel cells provide uninterrupted power and therefore longer uptime ensuring seamless economical monitoring and protection of properties. This makes them the ideal power supply for camera towers and other security applications. With their environmentally friendly  clean and silent power generation technology EFOY Pro fuel cells are the sustainable alternative to conventional generators positively impacting BauWatch’s carbon footprint ” says Dr. Peter Podesser  CEO of SFC Energy AG.For more information on SFC Energy's Clean Energy and Clean Power Management solutions  visit sfc.com.About SFC Energy AGSFC Energy AG is a leading provider of hydrogen and methanol fuel cells for stationary and mobile hybrid power solutions.

Russia Plans to Build Many MoreThe Ukrainian civilians woke long before dawn in the bitter cold  lined up for the single toilet and were loaded at gunpoint into the livestock trailer. They spent the next 12 hours or more digging trenches on the front lines for Russian soldiers.Many were forced to wear overlarge Russian military uniforms that could make them a target  and a former city administrator trudged around in boots five sizes too big. By the end of the day  their hands curled into icy claws  The Associated Press said.Nearby  in the occupied region of Zaporizhzhia  other Ukrainian civilians dug mass graves into the frozen ground for fellow prisoners who had not survived. One man who refused to dig was shot on the spot — yet another body for the grave.Thousands of Ukrainian civilians are being detained across Russia and the Ukrainian territories it occupies  in centers ranging from brand-new wings in Russian prisons to clammy basements. Most have no status under Russian law.And Russia is planning to hold possibly thousands more. A Russian government document obtained by The Associated Press dating to January outlined plans to create 25 new prison colonies and six other detention centers in occupied Ukraine by 2026.In addition  Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree in May allowing Russia to send people from territories with martial law  which includes all of occupied Ukraine  to those without  such as Russia. This makes it easier to deport Ukrainians who resist Russian occupation deep into Russia indefinitely  which has happened in multiple cases documented by the AP.Many civilians are picked up for alleged transgressions as minor as speaking Ukrainian or simply being a young man in an occupied region  and are often held without charge. Others are charged as terrorists  combatants  or people who “resist the special military operation.” Hundreds are used for slave labor by Russia’s military  for digging trenches and other fortifications  as well as mass graves.Torture is routine  including repeated electrical shocks  beatings that crack skulls and fracture ribs  and simulated suffocation. Many former prisoners told the AP they witnessed deaths. A United Nations report from late June documented 77 summary executions of civilian captives and the death of one man due to torture.Russia does not acknowledge holding civilians at all  let alone its reasons for doing so. But the prisoners serve as future bargaining chips in exchanges for Russian soldiers  and the UN has said there is evidence of civilians being used as human shields near the front lines.The AP spoke with dozens of people  including 20 former detainees  along with ex-prisoners of war  the families of more than a dozen civilians in detention  two Ukrainian intelligence officials and a government negotiator. Their accounts  as well as satellite imagery  social media  government documents and copies of letters delivered by the Red Cross  confirm a widescale Russian system of detention and abuse of civilians that stands in direct violation of the Geneva Conventions.Some civilians were held for days or weeks  while others have vanished for well over a year. Nearly everyone freed said they experienced or witnessed torture  and most described being shifted from one place to another without explanation.“It’s a business of human trafficking ” said Olena Yahupova  the city administrator who was forced to dig trenches for the Russians in Zaporizhzhia. “If we don’t talk about it and keep silent  then tomorrow anyone can be there — my neighbor  acquaintance  child.”INVISIBLE PRISONERS The new building in the compound of Prison Colony No. 2 is at least two stories tall  separated from the main prison by a thick wall.This facility in Russia’s eastern Rostov region has gone up since the war started in February 2022  according to satellite imagery analyzed by the AP. It could easily house the hundreds of Ukrainian civilians who are believed detained there  according to former captives  families of the missing  human rights activists and Russian lawyers. Two exiled Russian human rights advocates said it is heavily guarded by soldiers and armored vehicles.The building in Rostov is one of at least 40 detention facilities in Russia and Belarus  and 63 makeshift and formal in occupied Ukrainian territory where Ukrainian civilians are held  according to an AP map built on data from former captives  the Ukrainian Media Initiative for Human Rights  and the Russian human rights group Gulagu.net. The recent UN report counted a total of 37 facilities in Russia and Belarus and 125 in occupied Ukraine.Some also hold Russian prisoners accused or convicted of a variety of crimes. Other  more makeshift locations are near the front lines  and the AP documented two locations where former prisoners say Ukrainians were forced to dig trenches.The shadowy nature of the system makes it difficult to know exactly how many civilians are being detained. Ukraine’s government has been able to confirm legal details of a little over 1 000 who are facing charges.At least 4 000 civilians are held in Russia and at least as many scattered around the occupied territories  according to Vladimir Osechkin  an exiled Russian human rights activist who talks to informants within Russian prisons and founded Gulagu.net to document abuses. Osechkin showed AP a Russian prison document from 2022 saying that 119 people ‘‘opposed to the special military operation’’ in Ukraine were moved by plane to the main prison colony in the Russian region of Voronezh. Many Ukrainians later freed by Russia also described unexplained plane transfers.In all  Ukraine’s government believes around 10 000 civilians could be detained  according to Ukrainian negotiator Oleksandr Kononeko  based on reports from loved ones  as well as post-release interviews with some civilians and the hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers returned in prisoner exchanges. Ukraine said in June that about 150 civilians have been freed to Ukrainian-controlled territory  and the Russians deny holding others.“They say  ‘We don’t have these people  it’s you who is lying ’” Kononeko said.The detention of two men from the Kherson region in August 2022 offers a glimpse at how hard it is for families to track down loved ones in Russian custody.Artem Baranov  a security guard  and Yevhen Pryshliak  who worked at a local asphalt plant with his father  had been friends for over a decade. Their relationship was cemented when both bought dogs during the coronavirus pandemic  according to Baranov’s common-law wife  Ilona Slyva. Their evening walks continued even after Russia seized their hometown of Nova Kakhovka — shy Baranov with a giant black Italian mastiff and Pryshliak with a toy poodle whose apricot fur matched his beard.Their walk ran late the night of Aug. 15  and Pryshliak decided to stay at Baranov’s apartment rather than risk being caught breaking the Russian curfew. Neighbors later told the family that 15 armed Russian soldiers swooped in  ransacked the apartment and seized the men.For a month  they were in the local jail  with conditions relaxed enough that Slyva was able to talk to Pryshliak through the fence. Baranov  he told her  couldn’t come out.She sent in packages of food and clothes but did not know if they were reaching him. Finally  on Baranov’s birthday  she bought his favorite dessert of cream eclairs  smashed them up  and slipped in a scrap of paper with her new Russian phone number scrawled on it. She hoped the guards would have little interest in the sticky mess and just pass it along.A month went by  and the families learned the men had been transferred to a new prison in Sevastopol  in Crimea. Then the trail went dark.Four more months passed. Then a call came from the family of a man they had never met but would soon come to know well: Pavlo Zaporozhets.Zaporozhets  a Ukrainian from the occupied Kherson region charged with international terrorism  was sharing a cell in Rostov with Baranov. Since he faced charges  he had a lawyer.It was then that Slyva knew her gift of eclairs — and the phone number smuggled within them — had reached its destination. Baranov had memorized her number and passed it through a complex chain that finally got news of him to her on April 7.Baranov wrote that he was accused of espionage — an accusation that Slyva scorned as falling apart even under Russia’s internal logic. He was detained in August  and Russia illegally annexed the regions only in October.“When he was detained  he was on his own national territory ” she said. “They thought and thought and invented a criminal case against him for espionage.”Baranov wrote home that he was transported across prisons with his eyes closed in two planes  one of which had about 60 people. He and Pryshliak were separated at their third transfer in late winter. Pryshliak’s family has received a form letter from the Rostov prison denying he is an inmate there.The number of civilian detainees has grown rapidly over the course of the war. In the first wave early on  Russian units moved in with lists of activists  pro-Ukrainian community leaders  and military veterans. Melitopol Mayor Ivan Fedorov was taken when Russian forces seized control of his city but exchanged within a week for nine Russian soldiers  he said.Then they focused on teachers and doctors who refused to work with the occupation authorities. But the reasons for apprehending people today are as mundane as tying a ribbon to a bicycle in the Ukrainian colors of blue and yellow.“Now there is no logic ” Fedorov said.He estimated that around 500 Ukrainian civilians are detained just in his city at any time — numbers echoed by multiple people interviewed by the AP.A Ukrainian intelligence official said the Russian fear of dissidents had become “pathological” since last fall  as Russians brace for Ukraine’s counteroffensive. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the situation.The AP saw multiple missing person notices posted on closed Ukrainian social media chats for young men seized off the streets. The messages  written in Ukrainian  describe detentions at gunpoint at home and on the street  with pleas to send information and emojis of hearts and praying hands.The Geneva Conventions in general forbid the arbitrary detention or forced deportation of civilians  and state that detainees must be allowed to communicate with loved ones  obtain legal counsel and challenge allegations against them. But first they must be found.After months writing letter after letter to locate Pryshliak  his sister-in-law Liubov thinks she knows why the prisoners are moved around: “So that the families cannot find them. Just to hide the traces of crimes.”SLAVES IN THE TRENCHES Hundreds of civilians end up in a place that is possibly even more dangerous than the prisons: the trenches of occupied Ukraine.There  they are forced to build protection for Russian soldiers  according to multiple people who managed to leave Russian custody. Among them was Yahupova  the 50-year-old civil administrator detained in October 2022 in the Zaporizhzhia region  possibly because she is married to a Ukrainian soldier.Under international humanitarian law  Yahupova is a civilian — defined as anyone who is not an active member of or volunteer for the armed forces. Documented breaches of the law constitute a war crime and  if widespread and systematic  “may also constitute a crime against humanity.”But the distinctions between soldiers and civilians can be hard to prove in a war where Ukraine has urged all its citizens to help  for example by sending Russian troop locations via social media. In practice  the Russians are scooping up civilians along with soldiers  including those denounced by neighbors for whatever reason or seized seemingly at random.They picked Yahupova up at her house in October. Then they demanded she reveal information about her husband  taping a plastic bag over her face  beating her on the head with a filled water bottle and tightening a cable around her neck.They also dragged her out of the cell and drove her around town to identify pro-Ukrainian locals. She didn’t.When they hauled her out a second time  she was exhausted. As a soldier placed her in front of a Russian news camera  she could still feel the dried blood on the back of her neck. She was going to give an interview  her captors told her.Behind the camera  a gun was pointed at her head. The soldier holding it told her that if she gave the right answers to the Russian journalist interviewing her  she could go free.But she didn’t know what the right answers were. She went back to the cell.Three months later  without explanation  Yahupova was again pulled outside. This time  she was driven to a deserted checkpoint  where yet another Russian news crew awaited. She was ordered to hold hands with two men and walk about 5 meters (yards) toward Ukraine.The three Ukrainians were ordered to do another take. And another  to show that Russia was freeing the Ukrainian civilians in its custody.Except  at the end of the last take  Russian soldiers loaded them into a truck and drove them to a nearby crossroads. One put shovels into their hands.“Now you will do something for the good of the Russian Federation ” he said.And so Yahupova ended up digging trenches until mid-March with more than a dozen Ukrainian civilians  including business owners  a student  a teacher  and utility workers. She could see other crews in the distance  with armed guards standing over them. Most wore Russian military uniforms and boots  and lived in fear that Ukrainian artillery would mistake them for the enemy.The AP confirmed through satellite imagery the new trenches dug in the area where Yahupova and a man on the Ukrainian crew with her said they were held. He requested anonymity because his relatives still live under occupation.“Sometimes we even worked there 24 hours a day  when they had an inspection coming ” he said.The man also spoke with other Ukrainian civilians digging mass graves nearby for at least 15 people. He said one civilian had been shot for refusing to dig. Satellite imagery shows a mound of freshly-dug earth in the spot the man described.The man escaped during a Russian troop rotation  and Yahupova also made her way out. But both said hundreds of others are still in the occupied front lines  forced to work for Russia or die.When Yahupova returned to her home after more than five months  everything had been stolen. Her beloved dog had been shot. Her head ached  her vision was blurred  and her children — long since out of the occupied territories — urged her to leave.She traveled thousands of miles through Russia  north to the Baltics and back around to the front line in Ukraine  where she reunited with her husband serving with Ukrainian forces. Earlier married in a civil ceremony  the two got wed this time in church.Now safe in Ukrainian territory  Yahupova wants to testify against Russia — for the months it stole from her  the concussion that troubles her  the home she has lost. She still reflexively touches the back of her head  where the bottle struck her over and over.“They stole not only from me  they stole from half the country ” she said.TORTURE AS POLICY The abuse Yahupova described is common. Torture was a constant  whether or not there was information to extract  according to every former detainee interviewed by the AP. The UN report from June said 91% of prisoners “described torture and ill-treatment.”In the occupied territories  all the freed civilians interviewed by the AP described crammed rooms and cells  tools of torture prepared in advance  tape placed carefully next to office chairs to bind arms and legs  and repeated questioning by Russian’s FSB intelligence agency. Nearly 100 evidence photos obtained by the AP from Ukrainian investigators also showed instruments of torture found in liberated areas of Kherson  Kyiv and Kharkiv  including the same tools repeatedly described by former civilian captives held in Russia and occupied regions.Many former detainees spoke of wires linking prisoners’ bodies to electricity in field telephones or radios or batteries  in a procedure one man said the Russians dubbed “call your mother” or “call Biden.” UN human rights investigators said one victim described the same treatment given to Yahupova  a severe beating on the head with a filled water bottle.Viktoriia Andrusha  an elementary school math teacher  was seized by Russian forces on March 25  2022  after they ransacked her parents’ home in Chernihiv and found photos of Russian military vehicles on her phone. By March 28  she was in a prison in Russia. Her captors told her Ukraine had fallen and no one wanted any civilians back.For her  like so many others  torture came in the form of fists  batons of metal  wood and rubber  plastic bags. Men in black  with special forces chevrons on their sleeves  pummeled her in the prison corridor and in a ceramic-tiled room seemingly designed for quick cleaning. Russian propaganda played on a television above her.“There was a point when I was already sitting and saying: Honestly  do what you want with me. I just don’t care anymore ” Andrusha said.Along with the physical torture came mental anguish. Andrusha was told repeatedly that she would die in prison in Russia  that they would slash her with knives until she was unrecognizable  that her government cared nothing about a captive schoolteacher  that her family had forgotten her  that her language was useless. They forced captives to memorize verse after verse of the Russian national anthem and other patriotic songs.“Their job was to influence us psychologically  to show us that we are not human ” she said. “Our task was to make sure that everything they did to us did not affect us.”Then one day  without explanation  it was over for her and another woman kept with her. Guards ordered them to pack up  cuffed them and put them in a bus. The weight Andrusha had lost in prison showed starkly in the cast-off jacket that hung from her shoulders.They were soon joined by Ukrainian soldiers held captive elsewhere. On the other side  Andrusha saw three Russian soldiers. Although international law forbids the exchange of civilians as prisoners of war  the UN report on June 27 said this has happened in at least 53 cases  and Melitopol Mayor Fedorov confirmed it happened to him.A man detained with Andrusha in March 2022 is in captivity still. She doesn’t know the fate of the others she met. But many former captives take it upon themselves to contact the loved ones of their former cellmates.Andrusha recalled hours spent memorizing whispered phone numbers in a circle with other Ukrainians  on the chance one of them might get out. When she was freed  she passed them along to Ukrainian government officials.Andrusha has since regained some of her weight. She talks about her six months in prison calmly but with anger.“I was able to survive this ” she said  after a day back in the classroom with her students. “There are so many cases when people do not return.”In the meantime  for loved ones  the wait is agony.Anna Vuiko’s father was one of the earliest civilians detained  in March last year. A former glass factory worker on disability  Roman Vuiko had resisted when Russian soldiers tried to take over his home in suburban Kyiv  neighbors told his adult daughter. They drove a military truck into the yard  shattered the windows  cuffed the 50-year-old man and drove off.By May 2022  Vuiko was in a prison in Kursk  Russia  hundreds of kilometers (miles) away. All his daughter has gotten from him since is a handwritten letter  which arrived six months after he was taken away and four months after he wrote it. The standard phrases told his daughter nothing except that he was alive  and she suspects he has not received any of her letters.“I think about it every day ” she said. “It’s been a year  more than a year. ...

Together LanzaTech’s carbon capture and ut…,CHICAGO  July 12  2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Technip Energies (PARIS:TE) and LanzaTech Global  Inc. (NASDAQ: LNZA) signed a Joint Collaboration Agreement to create a new pathway to sustainable ethylene utilizing their combined technologies. Together LanzaTech’s carbon capture and utilization technology with Technip Energies’ Hummingbird® technology transform waste carbon into ethylene  the most common building block in petrochemicals.Ethylene is a building block for thousands of chemicals and materials  including plastics  detergents  and coatings that keep hospitals sterile  people safe  and food fresh. Its traditional production process is also one of the largest sources of carbon dioxide emissions in the chemical industry and remains one of its most challenging processes to decarbonize. This new joint process uses carbon emissions as the starting point rather than virgin fossil carbon. First  up to 95% of the CO 2 in the flue gas is captured from the furnaces of an ethylene cracker and mixed with hydrogen. Next LanzaTech’s biorecycling technology transforms the captured waste carbon into ethanol. Finally  Technip Energies’ Hummingbird® technology dehydrates the ethanol to ethylene.Technip Energies and LanzaTech have collaborated on other sustainable solutions since 2020  including a partnership with Borealis and On  the Swiss running shoe company  to make EVA foam for the sole of running shoes. Technip Energies also partners with LanzaJet  an independent company formed and spun off by LanzaTech  which includes the Hummingbird® technology in the LanzaJet™ Alcohol-to-Jet process which makes sustainable aviation fuel from ethanol.Arnaud Pieton  CEO of Technip Energies  stated: “We are very pleased to work with LanzaTech on another sustainable solution  this time to decarbonize ethylene. This breakthrough technology will not only capture carbon but will use it to make a valuable end product.”Dr. Jennifer Holmgren  CEO of LanzaTech  said: “By combining and integrating our process with that of Technip Energies  we have the potential to retrofit onto ethylene crackers around the world  supporting decarbonization of a sector that has limited choices today. The sustainable production of one of the most used commodity chemicals will have an impact on the lives of billions of people daily. Through partnerships such as this one with Technip Energies  we are creating meaningful pathways to break free from virgin fossil inputs for the things we use in our daily lives.”About Technip EnergiesTechnip Energies is a leading Engineering & Technology company for the energy transition  with leadership positions in Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG)  hydrogen and ethylene as well as growing market positions in blue and green hydrogen  sustainable chemistry and CO 2 management. The company benefits from its robust project delivery model supported by extensive technology  products and services offering.Operating in 35 countries  our 15 000 people are fully committed to bringing our client’s innovative projects to life  breaking boundaries to accelerate the energy transition for a better tomorrow.Technip Energies is listed on Euronext Paris with American depositary receipts (“ADRs”).

The IMO adopts an accelerated GHG Strategy for reaching net-zero GHG emissions in international shipping by  or around  2050. The strategy presents an ambitious roadmap for reducing shipping's contribution to global GHG emissions  underscoring the industry's commitment to environmental sustainability.Picture from the MEPC 80 in London: The United Nation’s (UN) IMO has just adopted a revised strategy to decarbonize global shipping at the Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC 80) climate summit in London. Photo credit: IMO.In this landmark decision  the IMO  the UN agency responsible for regulating shipping  has recently announced a comprehensive revision of its GHG reduction strategy  designed to combat climate change and align with global sustainability goals.“This is fantastic news for the future of the global shipping industry as IMO adopts an accelerated strategy for cleaner shipping in the years to come  with an ultimate ambition of achieving a zero-emission future. There is no doubt that fuel cell technology will play an essential role in achieving the revised targets set forth by the IMO ” said Tore Enger  Group CEO  TECO 2030. “This proves that the industry has to stand shoulder by shoulder in solving the largest challenge the industry has faced to date by eliminating harmful emissions while freight volumes are increasing. TECO 2030 is ready to deliver purpose developed fuel cells for the marine industry from 2024  with large volumes from 2025 "" Enger adds.Fuel cells are hydrogen engines which generate electricity through a mechanism that doesn’t require combustion. This means they produce fewer pollutants than conventional  combustion-based power generation technologies. Fuel cells are also highly efficient  producing more power per unit of fuel when compared to fossil fuel. As a result  fuel cells offer an alternative to traditional power generation with significant health  reliability  and environmental benefits. TECO 2030 is currently establishing themselves as a marine and heavy-duty fuel cell manufacturer and building up Europe’s first fuel cell Giga factory in Narvik  Norway.""The adoption of the 2023 IMO Greenhouse Gas Strategy is a monumental development for IMO and opens a new chapter towards maritime decarbonization "" says IMO Secretary-General Kitack Lim.The IMO is the United Nations specialized agency with responsibility for the safety and security of shipping and the prevention of marine and atmospheric pollution by ships. The IMO's primary purpose is to develop and maintain a comprehensive regulatory framework for shipping  and its remit today includes safety  environmental concerns  legal matters  technical cooperation  maritime security  and the efficiency of shipping.If you are interested in learning more about the GHG strategy  IMO’s press release and full report can be found here.Contact:Tore Enger  Group CEO  +47 920 83 800  tore.enger@teco2030.noAbout TECO 2030 ASA:TECO 2030 is building up Europe's first Giga production facility of hydrogen PEM fuel cell stacks and modules in Narvik  Norway.

Ekinops generated 2% of its revenue in Asia-Pacific in H1 this year.Lastly  in its domestic market  Ekinops posted H1 revenue growth of +9% vs. the year-earlier period  particularly driven by a doubling in sales of Optical Transport solutions.

This robust H1 performance  achieved despite the very challenging comparative figures after an exceptional 2022  comes in an overall less buoyant market context and a weaker economic environment. Despite this  we expect H1 sales to show good profitability in terms of gross margin.Visibility is weaker for H2 given the economic environment  and Ekinops is making it a priority to ramp up its commercial activity across all its geographies.""Reminder of 2023's guidanceHalfway through 2023  Group's guidance remains unchanged:revenue growth of over +12% ;; EBITDA margin between 15% and 19%  including human and technological investments to support its growth.In terms of external growth  Ekinops maintains its ambition to complete a transaction during the year  favoring a non-dilutive source of financing.2023 financial calendarDate Release July 27  2023 H1 2023 results October 11  2023 Q3 2023 revenue January 10  2024 FY 2023 revenueAll press releases are published after the close of trading on Euronext Paris.EKINOPS ContactDidier BrédyChairman and CEO[email protected]InvestorsMathieu OmnesInvestor relationTel.: +33 (0)1 53 67 36 92[email protected]PressAmaury DugastPress relationTel.: +33 (0)1 53 67 36 74[email protected]Logo - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/814911/Ekinops_Logo.jpgSOURCE Ekinops",neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.54,0.18,0.28,True,English,"['Ekinops', '2023 revenue', 'New three-month record sales figure', 'overall less buoyant market context', '2023 financial calendar Date Release', 'constant exchange rates', 'Didier Brédy', 'challenging comparative figures', 'Optical Transport solutions', 'key strategic region', 'weaker economic environment', 'Optical Transport activity', 'strong growth trajectory', 'US dollar terms', 'robust H1 performance', 'buoyant activity', 'domestic market', 'overall growth', 'H1 revenue growth', 'telecommunication solutions', 'challenging basis', 'WDM solutions', 'Access solutions', 'strong demand', 'commercial activity', 'leading provider', 'telecom operators', 'unaudited data', 'OTN technology', 'North America', 'Middle East', 'good profitability', 'gross margin', 'EBITDA margin', 'technological investments', 'dilutive source', 'Mathieu Omnes', 'Investor relation', 'Amaury Dugast', 'consolidated revenue', 'Services revenue', 'total revenue', 'Q3 2023 revenue', 'lower sales', 'Access sales', 'quarterly growth', 'half-year growth', 'slight growth', 'International growth', 'solid growth', 'external growth', '+42% sales growth', 'Euronext Paris', 'same period', 'year-earlier period', 'press releases', 'Press relation', 'good H1', 'H1 2023 results', 'Group revenue', 'FY 2023 revenue', 'H1 sales', 'Q2 2023 revenue', 'Q2 revenue', 'EMEA region', 'Q2 sales', 'full year', 'Q1 revenue', 'EKINOPS Contact', 'SOURCE Ekinops', 'robust +42', '25% growth', '+80% growth', 'revenues', 'July', 'PRNewswire', 'enterprises', 'April', 'June', 'IFRS', 'reminder', 'comparison', 'continuity', 'jump', 'success', 'appeal', 'Europe', 'Asia-Pacific', 'France', 'Software', '+13% rebound', 'dip', 'start', 'Africa', '+13% increase', 'recovery', 'Business', 'mid-year', 'doubling', 'Chairman', 'CEO', 'line', 'expectations', 'exceptional 2022', 'Visibility', 'H2', 'geographies', 'guidance', 'human', 'ambition', 'transaction', 'financing', 'close', 'trading', 'Investors', 'Tel.', 'Logo', '33', '1 53']",2023-07-12,2023-07-13,prnewswire.com

The mechanism of action of this active ingredient blocks the accumulation of glycosphingolipids and neuroinflammation  thereby significantly reducing neuronal death  the cause of progressive loss of function in patients. For patients over 17 years of age in the Phase 1/2 study  the product is administered in solid form. In the Phase 3 study  it will be administered in a liquid form  more suited to a paediatric population.Study design Phase 1/2: This is an open-label study involving 6 patients over 17 years of age with Batten CLN3 disease  treated with miglustat up to 600 mg/day for 2 years. The primary endpoint was safety and tolerability  assessed by adverse event reporting  bioassays and ECG  as well as miglustat pharmacokinetics. Secondary endpoints included efficacy parameters: the Unified Batten Disease Rating Scale  visual acuity  measurement of brain volumes by magnetic resonance imaging and measurement of retinal neuronal layer thickness by optical coherence tomography. Batten-1 dose escalation to a maximum of 600 mg/d was well tolerated  with no serious adverse events or discontinuations. The most frequently reported adverse events were gastrointestinal  reversible and mostly mild to moderate in intensity  demonstrating the good safety profile of Batten-1 in this population. Batten-1 will continue to be evaluated in these patients for a total of 24 months. Further information is available at https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/showithNCT05174039.About Batten diseaseJuvenile Batten disease or Spielmeyer-Vogt disease  also known as CLN3 disease  is a rare  fatal genetic disorder of the nervous system for which there is no cure. It belongs to the group of neuronal ceroid-lipofuscinoses (NLC). Over 400 mutations in 13 genes have been associated with NLC variants  which differ essentially in the age of onset of symptoms. The first symptom of the juvenile form  progressive vision loss  appears between the ages of 4 and 6. This is followed by cognitive and behavioral problems and motor difficulties. Convulsions appear within 2 to 4 years of onset. Gradually  patients decline both physically and mentally. Eventually  they become wheelchair-bound or even bedridden  before dying prematurely.The disease is always fatal - usually in late adolescence or early adulthood. In the USA and Europe  Batten disease is the most prevalent NLC  affecting around 2 000 patients[1] . From a pathophysiological point of view  interactions between neurons and glial cells play a key role in the onset and progression of all NLCs.About the Beyond Batten Disease Foundation (BBDF)The Beyond Batten Disease Foundation (BBDF) is the world's largest non-profit organization dedicated to funding research to treat and cure juvenile Batten disease (CLN3). Since its creation in 2008  over $35 million has been invested in research through donations  co-funding and strategic partnerships. BBDF spearheads a unique and coherent strategy  integrating independent scientific resources and collaboration with related organizations to conduct research into juvenile Batten disease. BBDF-sponsored research initially uncovered the mechanisms of the disease[2] . Today  a treatment is in sight. BBDF-funded research has led to the discovery of a drug  Batten-1  which slows disease progression in models of Batten disease.

Indeed  since the Covid-19 health crisis  Hong Kong has become the primary art market hub in the entire Asia-Pacific region. This year  however – and for the first time in ten years – Hong Kong is experiencing a slight contraction in its art market activity. Meanwhile  mainland China is slowly returning to a growth path.China's Fine Art auction turnoverhttps://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/07/image1-china-s-fine-art-auction-turnover.pngArtist Zhang Xiaogang in his studio  with Wan Jie  CEO of the Artron Group (left)  and thierry Ehrmann  President of Artmarket.com and Founder of Artprice (right)https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/07/image2-Zhang-Xiaogang-Wan-Jie-thierry-Ehrmann.jpgthierry Ehrmann  President of Artmarket.com and Founder of Artprice: “We have had a privileged partnership with the Chinese group Artron for over a decade  and it is this long collaboration that allows our joint reports to identify and analyze the stabilization of China's art market  with an effective reorganization of its market”.Two works fetched over $30 millionAt $33.1 million  on 24 February 2023 in Beijing  Yongle Auction hammered China's best fine art result of H1 for an ink on paper by Cui Ruzhuo  Rafting In Wind And Rain (2019). It was also the best result in mainland China for over five years. But it was only the 18th best fine art auction result in mainland China's auction history  a long way behind the $140 million hammered in 2017 for the 12 drawings that make up Qi Baishi's Screens of Landscapes (1925).In Hong Kong  on 5 April 2023  an ink on paper enhanced with gold by Zhang Daqian  Pink Lotuses on Gold Screen (1973)  was acquired for $32.1 million at Sotheby's. The island still fosters and promotes exchanges between East and West  recording multi-million dollar results for works by Yoshitomo Nara and Yayoi Kusama and works by Pablo Picasso and Jean-Michel Basquiat. At the start of the year  canvases by Miro  Magritte  Zao-Wou-ki  and Chagall naturally blended with sculptures by Jeff Koons and ultra-contemporary works by Matthew Wong  Nicolas Party  and Avery Singer in the finest Hong Kong catalogs.In total  Artprice has detailed data for nearly 16 000 fine art lots sold at auctions throughout China between 1 January and 30 June 2023. Hong Kong retains the highest average fine art lot price in the world (just under $230 000) with 2 600 works generating $595 million (incl. buyer's fees). But mainland China's data is also honorable with over 10 000 lots fetching an average price of $78 000.+180% growth in mainland ChinaWhile the art market is experiencing a sharp contraction in almost all Western countries  mainland China has posted relatively positive figures for H1 2023. Although it is still far from its exceptional performances of ten years ago  the country's fine art auction market generated almost three times more turnover than in H1 2022  which was hampered by the country's zero-covid policy at the time. However  the recent dynamism may have been boosted by sales that were simply rescheduled from last year; so it remains to be seen if the second half will post equally buoyant figures.The performances of Chinese auction houses China Guardian  Poly  Yongle  Rombon  and Xilling have once again become all the more important since Western auction operators are no longer hosting sales in mainland China for the time being. Their sales have been entirely focused on Hong Kong  consolidating a turnover that has been growing steadily over the last two decades.There is little doubt that the international art market is eager to see key works by the superstars of contemporary Chinese art resurface on the market. In H1 we saw several 7-digit results for works by Chen Yifei  Liu Ye  and Zhou Chunya  among others  and Bonhams sold Zeng Fanzhi Mask 2000 No. 3 (2000) for $3.1 million in Hong Kong. This result is consistent with those recorded ten years ago for the same series  but the works of these great names of ‘new Chinese painting' have been circulating with much less intensity  and their masterpieces have been surprisingly discreet in auction rooms over the past three years.Images: [ https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/07/image1-china-s-fine-art-auction-turnover.png ][ https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/07/image2-Zhang-Xiaogang-Wan-Jie-thierry-Ehrmann.jpg ]Copyright 1987-2023 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to c ontact our E conometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: econometrics@artprice.comTry our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demoSubscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

(Prosus) (AEX and JSE: PRX): Prosus shareholders are advised that notice is hereby given  in terms of the notice of annual general meeting published today  on 12 July 2023  that the hybrid annual general meeting of Prosus (the Annual General Meeting)will be held at 14:00 CET on Wednesday  23 August 2023  at The Warehouse  Generaal Vetterstraat 51-A  1059 BT Amsterdam  the Netherlands. Prosus will  in any event  ensure virtual access to the Annual General Meeting in a manner consistent with the arrangements for a virtual meeting. Virtual participation will be subject to Prosus's terms and conditions for general meetings.Prosus shareholders can virtually attend and vote at the Annual General Meeting on all resolutions via www.abnamro.com/evoting  and  if they wish  vote in real time online.Prosus shareholders registered in the Prosus shareholders’ register or in the (sub)registers designated by the board of directors of Prosus (the Prosus Board) on Wednesday  26 July 2023 (i.e. the record date)  or their authorised representatives  who wish to attend and/or vote at the Annual General Meeting must apply via www.abnamro.com/evoting by no later than on Wednesday  16 August 2023  at 17:30 CET.The notice of the Annual General Meeting  including the agenda with explanatory notes  together with the power of attorney and a shareholder circular  which contains relevant information pertaining to the Proposed Transaction (as defined below) (the Shareholder Circular)  is available on Prosus’ website at www.prosus.com/investors/shareholder-centre/shareholder-meetings. Prosus’ remuneration report and the proposed remuneration policy are included in the 2023 annual report of Prosus that has already been made available to Prosus shareholders.The record date in order to be eligible to vote at the Annual General Meeting is Wednesday  26 July 2023.Removal of the Cross-Holding StructureOn 27 June 2023  the board of directors of Naspers Limited (Naspers) and the Prosus Board announced that Naspers and Prosus (together with their consolidated subsidiaries  the Group) intend to implement a proposed transaction in terms of which the cross-holding structure between Naspers and Prosus will be removed (the Proposed Transaction).Prosus shareholders are advised that further information pertaining to the Proposed Transaction in relation to Prosus is set out in the Shareholder Circular that Prosus has published today  on 12 July 2023  simultaneously with the notice of Annual General Meeting  on Prosus’ website at www.prosus.com/investors/shareholder-centre/shareholder-meetings.The agenda and explanatory notes  including the shareholder resolutions that must be approved by the Prosus shareholders in order to implement the Proposed Transaction  are set out in the notice of Annual General Meeting. Voting on these matters necessary to implement the Proposed Transaction in so far as it relates to Prosus will consequently take place at the Annual General Meeting.Prosus shareholders are advised to read the Shareholder Circular carefully and in its entirety. Any decision to approve the shareholder resolutions pertaining to the Proposed Transaction at the Annual General Meeting should be made only on the basis of the information in the Shareholder Circular and/or the notice of Annual General Meeting.Subject to obtaining the requisite approvals of the Prosus shareholders and the Naspers shareholders  further details pertaining to the implementation of the Proposed Transaction  including the applicable salient dates and times for implementation and the entitlement ratio of the Prosus capitalisation issue to be implemented pursuant to the Proposed Transaction  will be outlined in the announcement to be released by Prosus following the annual general meeting of Naspers  expected to be held on Thursday  24 August 2023.Dividend /Capital declarationFurther to the announcement made on 27 June 2023  the board recommended that  in total  shareholders receive a distribution (in the form of a capital repayment for holders of ordinary shares N and a dividend for holders of ordinary shares B and ordinary shares A1) of approximately €175m. The distribution per share to which shareholders are entitled will be impacted by the Proposed Transaction as follows:should the Proposed Transaction be implemented and Prosus issue the additional shares  Prosus shareholders will receive  in the form of a capital repayment  7 euro cents per Prosus ordinary share N. Naspers  as the holder of Prosus ordinary shares B  will receive 0.000007 euro cents per Prosus ordinary share B. Holders of Prosus ordinary shares A1 will receive an amount per Prosus ordinary share A1 equal to the outcome of the formula set forth in the Prosus articles of association  as amended; or should the Proposed Transaction not be implemented and the issued share capital remain as it currently is  Prosus shareholders will receive  in the form of a capital repayment  15 euro cents per Prosus ordinary share N. Naspers  as the holder of Prosus ordinary shares B  will receive 0.000015 euro cents per Prosus ordinary share B. Holders of ordinary shares A1 will receive an amount per Prosus ordinary share A1 equal to the outcome of the formula set forth in the articles of association.Therefore  it is currently expected that the aggregate distribution to be paid to Prosus shareholders will be approximately the same under either option.Furthermore  the Prosus Board recommends that those holders of Prosus ordinary shares N as at 3 November 2023 (the Dividend Record Date) who do not wish to receive a distribution in the form of a capital repayment  can choose to receive a dividend payment instead. A choice for one option implies an opt-out from the other. If the distribution is confirmed by the Prosus shareholders at the Annual General Meeting  elections to receive a dividend payment instead of a capital repayment will need to be made by holders of Prosus ordinary shares N by 20 November 2023.Capital repayments and dividend payments will be payable to the Prosus shareholders registered in the Prosus shareholders’ register or in the (sub)registers designated by the Prosus Board on the Dividend Record Date and paid on 28 November 2023. Capital repayments will be paid from qualifying share capital for Dutch tax purposes. No dividend withholding tax will be withheld on the amounts of capital reductions paid to the Prosus shareholders. However  if holders of Prosus ordinary shares N rather elect to receive a dividend payment from retained earnings  such dividend payments will be subject to the Dutch dividend withholding tax rate of 15%.Dividend payments payable to holders of Prosus ordinary shares N who elect to receive a dividend payment and who hold their Prosus ordinary shares N through the listing of Prosus on the JSE will  in addition to the 15% Dutch dividend withholding tax  be subject to South African dividend tax at a rate of up to 20%. The amount of additional South African dividend tax will be calculated by deducting from the 20% a rebate equal to the Dutch dividend withholding tax paid in respect of the dividend payment (without right of recovery). Prosus shareholders holding their Prosus ordinary shares N through the listing of Prosus on the JSE  unless exempt from paying South African dividend tax or entitled to a reduced withholding tax rate in terms of an applicable tax treaty  will be subject to the maximum rate of South African dividend tax of 20%.The issued share capital of Prosus as at today  on 12 July 2023  is 1 851 020 628 Prosus ordinary shares N  4 456 650 Prosus ordinary shares A1 and 1 128 507 756 Prosus ordinary shares B.Repurchase ProgrammeProsus shareholders are referred to the various announcements that have been released pertaining to the ongoing  open-ended repurchase of Prosus ordinary shares N  which commenced on 27 June 2022 (the Repurchase Programme).In order to have a stable share count for purposes of both the Proposed Transaction and the distribution (whether as capital repayment or as dividend payment)  it is expected that the Repurchase Programme will be temporarily suspended for a short period immediately before these events  in order to allow for efficient and effective implementation of the Proposed Transaction and the capital repayments and dividend payments  respectively. The Repurchase Programme will resume after each suspension and Prosus shareholders will be updated accordingly.The Group will also continue to provide weekly updates on the Repurchase Programme by means of press releases and announcements on SENS and on the Prosus website (www.prosus.com).JSE sponsor to ProsusInvestec Bank LimitedInternational Legal Advisor: Allen & Overy LLPLegal Advisor: Webber WentzelAbout ProsusProsus is a global consumer internet group and one of the largest technology investors in the world.

They will require the use of embedded microdisplays that can offer high luminance and contrast  but also very low power consumption from super lightweight batteries. Among competing technologies  organic LED (OLED) demonstrate an excellent overall performance compared to classic LED ones  and they are increasingly used for see-through Near-Eye Displays (NED) in viewfinder eyepieces for cameras.Recent announcements for new mixed-reality headsets that could reach the shelves in 2024 have boosted the AR market  including applications for industry and security segments. The global market for microdisplays designed for AR/VR use could reach $4 billion by 2027  according to a 2022 report by KBV Research  a 4x increase compared to 2020  with 10% of the total value captured by OLED technologies. 15 million units of AR smart glasses could be shipped worldwide by 2027  according to CCS Insight.Among the handful of international players able to design and manufacture these low energy consumption OLED microdisplays  MICROOLED can address both consumer and recreational markets (the ActiveLook head up display module to be embedded in glasses for real time visual information in hand free activity use cases)  and industry/security ones.

Indeed  since the Covid-19 health crisis  Hong Kong has become the primary art market hub in the entire Asia-Pacific region. This year  however – and for the first time in ten years – Hong Kong is experiencing a slight contraction in its art market activity. Meanwhile  mainland China is slowly returning to a growth path.China’s Fine Art auction turnover Artist Zhang Xiaogang in his studio  with Wan Jie  CEO of the Artron Group (left)  and thierry Ehrmann  President of Artmarket.com and Founder of Artprice (right)thierry Ehrmann  President of Artmarket.com and Founder of Artprice: ""We have had a privileged partnership with the Chinese group Artron for over a decade  and it is this long collaboration that allows our joint reports to identify and analyze the stabilization of China's art market  with an effective reorganization of its market"".Two works fetched over $30 millionAt $33.1 million  on 24 February 2023 in Beijing  Yongle Auction hammered China's best fine art result of H1 for an ink on paper by Cui Ruzhuo  Rafting In Wind And Rain (2019). It was also the best result in mainland China for over five years. But it was only the 18th best fine art auction result in mainland China's auction history  a long way behind the $140 million hammered in 2017 for the 12 drawings that make up Qi Baishi's Screens of Landscapes (1925).In Hong Kong  on 5 April 2023  an ink on paper enhanced with gold by Zhang Daqian  Pink Lotuses on Gold Screen (1973)  was acquired for $32.1 million at Sotheby's. The island still fosters and promotes exchanges between East and West  recording multi-million dollar results for works by Yoshitomo Nara and Yayoi Kusama and works by Pablo Picasso and Jean-Michel Basquiat. At the start of the year  canvases by Miro  Magritte  Zao-Wou-ki  and Chagall naturally blended with sculptures by Jeff Koons and ultra-contemporary works by Matthew Wong  Nicolas Party  and Avery Singer in the finest Hong Kong catalogs.In total  Artprice has detailed data for nearly 16 000 fine art lots sold at auctions throughout China between 1 January and 30 June 2023. Hong Kong retains the highest average fine art lot price in the world (just under $230 000) with 2 600 works generating $595 million (incl. buyer's fees). But mainland China's data is also honorable with over 10 000 lots fetching an average price of $78 000.+180% growth in mainland ChinaWhile the art market is experiencing a sharp contraction in almost all Western countries  mainland China has posted relatively positive figures for H1 2023. Although it is still far from its exceptional performances of ten years ago  the country's fine art auction market generated almost three times more turnover than in H1 2022  which was hampered by the country's zero-covid policy at the time. However  the recent dynamism may have been boosted by sales that were simply rescheduled from last year; so it remains to be seen if the second half will post equally buoyant figures.The performances of Chinese auction houses China Guardian  Poly  Yongle  Rombon  and Xilling have once again become all the more important since Western auction operators are no longer hosting sales in mainland China for the time being. Their sales have been entirely focused on Hong Kong  consolidating a turnover that has been growing steadily over the last two decades.There is little doubt that the international art market is eager to see key works by the superstars of contemporary Chinese art resurface on the market. In H1 we saw several 7-digit results for works by Chen Yifei  Liu Ye  and Zhou Chunya  among others  and Bonhams sold Zeng Fanzhi Mask 2000 No. 3 (2000) for $3.1 million in Hong Kong. This result is consistent with those recorded ten years ago for the same series  but the works of these great names of 'new Chinese painting' have been circulating with much less intensity  and their masterpieces have been surprisingly discreet in auction rooms over the past three years.Images: [https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/07/image1-china-s-fine-art-auction-turnover.png][https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2023/07/image2-Zhang-Xiaogang-Wan-Jie-thierry-Ehrmann.jpg]Copyright 1987-2023 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to contact our Econometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: [email protected]for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: Try our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demo(free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demo Subscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

After a drone strike on Ukraine’s Odesa port unsettled the wheat market on Tuesday  attention turned back to strong competition from Russian exports  traders said.Farm office FranceAgriMer forecast that French soft wheat exports outside the European Union would fall 5% from last season to 9.6 million metric tons  citing stiff competition led by Russia  though intra-EU demand was seen higher amid drought in Spain.Traders said Morocco remained one of the few active export destinations for EU wheat currently.“The main importers are able to buy Russian wheat at over $20 a (metric) ton cheaper than in the west EU so Russian wheat is likely to meet the main export demand in the near future ” one German trader said.“But Morocco is a positive exception with EU wheat in demand and some German wheat has just been sold for nearby July shipment there.” Import demand was relatively quiet and a tender issued by Algeria for delivery to two smaller ports only was expected to bring a limited volume.Traders continued to await the outcome of talks over a Black Sea grain deal  which allows Ukrainian shipments  amid Russian warnings it could quit the arrangement next week.In France  the market was waiting for harvesting to progress in key northern grain belts after the farm ministry on Tuesday forecast the soft wheat crop below some recent estimates. “There is a bit of disappointment.
