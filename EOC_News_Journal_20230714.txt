In an investor circula…,"* JPM uncovers possible shortfall in retailer Magnit's shares* Magnit buying back foreigners' blocked shares at 50% discount* JPM plans to participate in Magnit tender offer -documentLONDON  July 13 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan has become the latest major bank struggling to find Russian stocks linked to some client investments  adding to fears for investors still hoping to recoup some value from stranded assets in the country.In an investor circular dated July 12 and seen by Reuters  the Wall Street bank said ""it was actively seeking to recover"" shares in Russian retail group Magnit  which underpinned depositary receipts (DRs) JPM had issued to investors before Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.Western sanctions and Russian countermeasures have marooned assets held by individuals and companies on both sides.Moscow has rewritten rules governing foreign ownership of Russian company shares in response to those sanctions  triggering confusion among investors and increasing their risks of heavy losses.Reforms include upending the role of global banks in the supervision of depositary receipt programs originally designed to increase international investment in Russia's major companies  and requiring substantial discounts for so-called ""unfriendly"" investors' sales of stock.A spokesperson for JPM confirmed the authenticity of the investor circular but declined to comment further.DRs are certificates issued by a bank representing shares in a foreign company traded on a local stock exchange. Swapping DRs for shares in the Russian company is a first step towards an effort to recover money.MISSING SHARESJPM said the shares in question ""may be missing"" after ""certain holders"" cancelled their DRs twice  firstly under a business-as-usual process in April last year and again in August after Moscow introduced laws on the mandatory conversion of DRs to reduce foreign influence over Russian companies.According to JPM's circular  the shares currently unaccounted for are estimated to be less than 1% of the shares held in custody at another financial institution.The possible shortfall in Magnit shares held on behalf of JPM's investors comes soon after Deutsche Bank warned clients it could no longer guarantee full access to Russian stocks belonging to them  Reuters exclusively reported in June.""Any cash equivalent of the missing shares that is recovered will be distributed pro rata among the remaining DR holders "" JPM said in the circular  echoing a plan also pursued by Deutsche Bank.Lawyers and other advisers contacted by Reuters have previously described the process faced by global investors seeking to convert Russian depositary receipts into the company stock belonging to them as ""complete chaos"".Deutsche attributed its shortfall to Moscow's decision to allow investors to convert some of the DRs into local stock without its ""involvement or oversight"". This meant Deutsche was unable to reconcile the company shares held at another custodian bank with the depositary receipts on its own books.The Bank of Russia did not immediately respond to a request for comment on JP Morgan's search for the potentially missing Magnit shares.Krasnodar-based Magnit and Russia's National Settlement Depository (NSD) did not immediately reply to requests for comment.The NSD has previously said that it was not responsible for implementing Russia's forced conversion law and had no information about its consequences.BUYBACK OFFERMagnit  Russia's second-largest retailer with almost 28 000 food and home goods stores across Russia and Uzbekistan  is offering to buy back blocked shares from foreign shareholders at a 50% discount -- as demanded by the Kremlin -- the first proposal of its kind.Last month  Magnit tripled the size of its offer to almost 30% of its outstanding shares on strong demand from Western investors keen to exit Russian holdings and this week extended that to include shareholders holding stakes through Euroclear.More than 60% of Magnit's shares are free-float  with shareholders including major global asset managers  Refinitiv data shows.When first announcing the plans  Magnit said its voluntary tender offer was also addressed to JPM  regarding shares held in its DR program custody account.In its July 12 circular  JPM said it intends to participate in Magnit's tender offer  and that any GDR holders not wishing to have their shares tendered should surrender them by 2100 GMT on July 14.Magnit has already obtained government approval  something Western executives have said is a lengthy and difficult process.Two sources with knowledge of Magnit's plans have told Reuters that should Magnit's offer succeed  it could open the door for other companies to follow suit and allow Western investors to recoup more blocked funds.

Most Read from BloombergSingapore Arrests Minister ,(Bloomberg) -- International bond sales out of Latin America are on the rise again as hopes for US rate cuts this year fade  leading companies and governments back to the capital markets.Most Read from BloombergIssuers from the private and public sector have raised more than $49 billion by selling bonds denominated in reserve and local currencies through July 13  according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s just $9 billion short of the $58 billion raised in all of 2022  the slowest year in terms of sales since 2008. For this year  bankers at Citigroup Inc. forecast close to $100 billion in international bond sales from the region  while BNP Paribas SA expects about $60 billion of such deals.Central banks in the region started tightening their monetary policy ahead of their counterparts in the US and elsewhere  allowing for potential rate cuts. In the US  traders are pricing in another 25-basis points rate hike  which would bring the Federal Reserve’s benchmark rate to a target range between 5.25% and 5.5% — around 100 basis points higher than what market participants were forecasting in May for the end of the year  according to data compiled by Bloomberg.“Some sovereigns still have some funding needs and might look to pre-fund next year’s budget given the constructive primary market tone ” said Anna Abadias  a vice president in BNP’s LatAm debt capital markets team. The bank expects highly ranked corporates and financial institutions to consider tapping the market “now that rates are expected to remain higher for longer ” she said.Several deals could come to market in the second half of the year. Brazil hired Banco Itau BBA  JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Banco Santander Brasil SA to assist with the nation’s first-ever sustainable bond sale  a long-awaited transaction that’s expected to hit markets by the end of the year.The Brazilian Treasury said Friday it would also monitor market conditions for possible issuances of traditional external debt. The Latin American nation may tap its 6% bond due in 2033  a person familiar with the matter said last month.Banco Internacional  a Chilean commercial bank  recently conducted a series of video conferences ahead of a potential five-year benchmark transaction  denominated in dollars  people familiar with the matter said earlier this week. A press officer for the Santiago-based bank didn’t immediately respond to a request for a comment.Chile and Paraguay  as well as oil majors Petroleo Brasileiro SA and Ecopetrol SA  were among the Latin American issuers that priced dollar-denominated transactions in June. Petrobas raised $1.25 billion with a 10-year bond that attracted an order book 3.4 times of the deal size  the company said in a July 3 statement. The company is monitoring the markets and weighing additional transactions that would reduce the cost of capital by canceling its most expensive debt ahead of time  Chief Financial Officer Sergio Caetano Leite said in an interview.“The time had come to put our feet in the water and see what the temperature was ” he said. “The acceptance was good  which leads us to continue looking at the debt markets. Petrobras is back to the game.”Latin American corporates are venturing back into the market  said Adrian Guzzoni  Latin America head of debt capital markets at Citi. The expectation is that the “market will continue to improve in terms of volumes” said Guzzoni. “When some of the corporates start coming  obviously lot many others follow suit.”Another driver for new issues could be the need to refinance bank facilities that companies took on to avoid having to tap the bond markets during recent periods of market volatility  said Juan Fullaondo  head of Latin America and Caribbean debt capital markets at Bank of Nova Scotia.Issuers are also registering investor demand for bond sales in local currencies. Uruguay  Chile  Peru and the Dominican Republic this year have priced local-currency debt in a format that makes easy to buy for domestic and international investors alike. These bonds can usually be settled by clearing houses widely used by international investors  including Euroclear.“Seeing transactions in local currency with some international investors is a good sign in terms of openness in the market because those trades typically are done in healthy markets ” said Guzzoni.Mexico will offer a sustainable bond maturing in May 2035 with an 8% coupon on July 20  the country’s central bank said Wednesday.Read more: World-Beating Currency Rally Spurs Latin America Debt SalesEmerging-market yields have stabilized in recent months  but remain at significantly higher levels than a year ago. That however isn’t deterring issuers. “Issuers are taking advantage of the constructive market tone to refinance upcoming maturities and extend their maturity profiles ” BNP’s Abadias said.“While in many cases these exercises lead to more costly new debt  nobody can predict whether demand for longer-dated credit will be there next year ” Abadias said.--With assistance from Mariana Durao  Michael O'Boyle  Maria Elena Vizcaino and Andrea Niper.(Adds detail Brazil’s ESG bond issuance plans from fifth paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek©2023 Bloomberg L.P.,neutral,0.04,0.95,0.01,mixed,0.39,0.15,0.47,True,English,"['Latin American Bond Issuers', 'High Rates Persist', 'Chief Financial Officer Sergio Caetano Leite', 'LatAm debt capital markets team', '25-basis points rate hike', 'Banco Santander Brasil SA', 'potential five-year benchmark transaction', 'constructive primary market tone', 'Caribbean debt capital markets', 'The Latin American nation', 'Latin America Debt Sales', 'potential rate cuts', 'The Brazilian Treasury', 'traditional external debt', 'Banco Itau BBA', 'Petroleo Brasileiro SA', ""Michael O'Boyle"", 'Maria Elena Vizcaino', 'constructive market tone', 'costly new debt', 'World-Beating Currency Rally', 'Latin American corporates', 'Chilean commercial bank', 'sustainable bond sale', 'Latin America head', 'Latin American issuers', 'US rate cuts', 'BNP Paribas SA', 'International bond sales', 'benchmark rate', 'financial institutions', 'press officer', 'debt markets', 'expensive debt', 'local-currency debt', 'Banco Internacional', 'Ecopetrol SA', 'bond markets', 'new issues', 'local currency', 'healthy markets', 'international investors', '10-year bond', 'public sector', 'local currencies', 'Citigroup Inc.', 'Central banks', 'monetary policy', 'target range', 'funding needs', 'vice president', 'second half', 'JPMorgan Chase', 'possible issuances', 'video conferences', 'oil majors', 'order book', 'deal size', 'many others', 'recent periods', 'Juan Fullaondo', 'Nova Scotia', 'Dominican Republic', 'good sign', 'Emerging-market yields', 'recent months', 'higher levels', 'upcoming maturities', 'maturity profiles', 'many cases', 'dated credit', 'Mariana Durao', 'Santiago-based bank', 'bank facilities', 'market participants', 'market conditions', 'market volatility', 'dollar-denominated transactions', 'additional transactions', 'Federal Reserve', 'Several deals', 'investor demand', 'Anna Abadias', 'July 3 statement', 'Adrian Guzzoni', 'slowest year', '6% bond', 'Bloomberg', 'rise', 'hopes', 'companies', 'governments', 'private', 'bonds', 'data', 'terms', 'bankers', 'region', 'counterparts', 'traders', 'May', 'end', 'sovereigns', 'budget', 'Co.', 'person', 'matter', 'series', 'dollars', 'people', 'request', 'comment', 'Paraguay', 'June', 'Petrobas', 'company', 'time', 'interview', 'feet', 'water', 'temperature', 'acceptance', 'Petrobras', 'game', 'expectation', 'volumes', 'lot', 'suit', 'driver', 'Uruguay', 'Peru', 'format', 'domestic', 'houses', 'Euroclear', 'openness', 'trades', 'Mexico', '8% coupon', 'country', 'advantage', 'exercises', 'assistance']",2023-07-14,2023-07-14,finance.yahoo.com

The Bitcoin ETF by Jacobi Asset Management — a London-based multi-asset investment platform — was set to debut on the Euronext Amsterdam exchange in July 2022.However  unprecedented market conditions caused by the collapse of the Terra ecosystem in May 2022  as well as the FTX collapse in November  forced the asset manager to postpone the listing. The Jacobi Bitcoin ETF received approval from the Guernsey Financial Services Commission (GFSC) to launch its Bitcoin ETF in October 2021.The asset manager told the Financial Times that it has decided to launch the ETF now because it has seen a gradual shift in demand compared with 2022. The asset manager told Cointelegraph that it is still assessing the launch and will share a date soon.The Jacobi Bitcoin ETF is a centrally cleared crypto-backed financial instrument with custody supported by Fidelity Digital Assets  a major shift from the usual exchange-traded notes (ETNs). In Europe  all crypto-backed traditional financial instruments were structured as ETNs  rather than funds.The major difference between an ETN and an ETF is that the ETF shareholder owns a portion of the fund’s underlying assets  while ETN investors own debt security. ETFs  unlike ETNs  cannot be leveraged or use derivatives  which could otherwise lead to market manipulation risks.Related: Grayscale resolves lawsuit with Fir Tree over proposed changes to Bitcoin TrustWhile Europe approved its first spot Bitcoin ETF in October 2021  the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has rejected all spot Bitcoin ETFs to date.

This success is the result of close collaboration with long-standing partners  including pick-up point operator Relais Colis and sports retailer Decathlon.“This achievement is a major milestone  thanks to the support from our strategic partners. As we continue to roll out a vast open and shared parcel locker network in France  we're actively preparing to welcome even more new partners ” explains Benoit Berson  Chief Solution Officer  Parcel Locker Solutions at Quadient. “We are observing a number of players deploying their own locker network  creating a multiplication of urban storage units to the detriment of public space. Besides being unsustainable in the long term  this solution is not thought through from a customer experience point of view. We have designed our network of universal lockers to fit into the urban environment  offering an open solution shared between the various players in transportation  local retail  and service companies. It is the only solution capable of combining the last mile and first mile in a way that is truly service-oriented  eco-friendly and rational over the long term.""For several years now  Quadient has been gradually extending its network of smart lockers across many countries  offering consumers a convenient  fast and secure solution for collecting their online orders. Available in Decathlon stores for their Click & Collect offer  but also in Carrefour retail stores  shopping malls  train stations and other public areas in France  Parcel Pending by Quadient lockers are an efficient solution for managing deliveries and collections 24/7. In the near future  they will also be available for returns and second-hand parcel depots.Christophe Cornilleau  General Manager of Relais Colis  said: ""We are delighted to celebrate this remarkable achievement with Quadient.

27742,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://ambcrypto.com/bitcoin-etf-finds-home-not-in-the-u-s-but/,Bitcoin ETFs expand out of U.S.  find root in…,As per a recent Financial Times report  Jacobi will launch its BTC ETF this month. It will be Europe's first BTC ETF to get listed.,Jacobi Asset Management  headquartered in London  first announced its plans to launch the Bitcoin ETF in July 2022.But the company shelved its plans due to last year’s disastrous crypto failures.In an extraordinary development  Europe’s first Bitcoin [BTC] exchange-traded fund (ETF) is set to launch this month.According to a recent Financial Times report  Jacobi Asset Management will soon list its Bitcoin ETF publicly on the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange.The asset management firm  headquartered in London  received regulatory approval from the Guernsey Financial Services Commission (GFSC) for its ETF in October 2021. It announced its plans to launch the ETF on the Euronext Amsterdam exchange in July 2022.However  the firm did not launch the product last year. We can attribute the reasons for this one-year delay to multiple crypto failures in 2022.Last year  we saw the collapse of the Terra [LUNA] ecosystem in May and that of the FTX crypto exchange in November.According to experts  these disastrous events prompted Jacobi to proceed with caution in launching its Bitcoin ETF. It will be out soon with the BCOIN ticker.The asset management firm is collaborating with Fidelity Digital Assets to offer asset custody services to its users. It is also partnering with Flow Traders and DRW to allow the trading of the ETF on the exchange.Jacobi underlines the nature of its Bitcoin ETFThe report stresses upon a significant factor underlying the nature of Bitcoin.So far  all digital assets exchange traded products in Europe have been structured as exchange traded notes (ETNs)  rather than funds (ETFs).ETF shareholders own a portion of a fund’s underlying shares. However  an ETN shareholder owns a portion of debt security  not the underlying asset itself.The firm’s co-founder and Chief Operating Officer (COO) Peter Lane told Ignites Europe last year There has been so much misinformation and misuse of the term ETF by [ETN] issuers  presumably to obfuscate the risks that are inherent in acquiring and investing in ETNs.Jacobi has strongly underlined the fact that the firm is launching a (Bitcoin) ETF  rather than an ETN.

June's figure compares with May's 4.0% and forecasts of 3.1%.A rate hike on July 26  however  remains the most likely outcome. ""Fed officials continue to think that 4.8 percent is still too hot and that the risk of a reversal in inflation expectations and inflation is still to be carefully managed. Because the favorable base effect due to energy prices will begin to fade in the coming months and the inflation outcome will be less palatable. The current increase in energy prices could then fuel price dynamics again in the coming months  and if China manages to fuel growth through broad monetary and fiscal stimulus  the impact on headline inflation could be felt "" commented Ipek Ozkardeskaya  Senior Analyst at Swissquote Bank.""Moreover  a potential Chinese boost to inflation looks much less threatening today than it did a couple of months ago. Chinese exports tumbled 12 percent in June  worse than the 7.5 percent drop in May and market forecasts of a 9.5 percent drop. June's drop in Chinese exports marked the steepest decline in sales since February 2020.

Vallourec now expects second quarter EBITDA to be around €370 million  and total cash generation to be around €110 million. Vallourec expects net debt at the end of Q2 2023 to be around €870 million compared to €1 billion at the end of Q1 2023. Vallourec notes that these results are still subject to Board approval1.Major contributing factors to this better-than-expected EBITDA were strong results in the Eastern Hemisphere  specifically in the Middle East  and smaller than anticipated losses in Germany. The higher total cash generation additionally benefitted from efficient working capital management.Vallourec Further Clarifies Full-Year 2023 OutlookIn its Q1 2023 results communication  Vallourec noted expectations that 2023 EBITDA would improve versus 2022 and would be somewhat first-half-weighted. Now  Vallourec further clarifies that it expects full-year 2023 EBITDA to range between €950 million and €1 100 million. Total cash generation in the second half of 2023 is expected to be positive excluding any potential benefit of asset sales.

Vallourec now expects second quarter EBITDA to be around €370 million  and total cash generation to be around €110 million. Vallourec expects net debt at the end of Q2 2023 to be around €870 million compared to €1 billion at the end of Q1 2023. Vallourec notes that these results are still subject to Board approval1.Major contributing factors to this better-than-expected EBITDA were strong results in the Eastern Hemisphere  specifically in the Middle East  and smaller than anticipated losses in Germany. The higher total cash generation additionally benefitted from efficient working capital management.Vallourec Further Clarifies Full-Year 2023 OutlookIn its Q1 2023 results communication  Vallourec noted expectations that 2023 EBITDA would improve versus 2022 and would be somewhat first-half-weighted.

(Euronext Amsterdam: NXFIL)  the global provider of breakthrough direct nanofiltration (dNF) technology for pure and affordable water with strong sustainability benefits  today reports its half-year 2023 revenue and increasing lead-time in pilot conversion  resulting in an adjusted full-year 2023 revenue outlook.NX Filtration is experiencing a delay in revenue growth that is caused by longer lead times to convert pilot projects into large full-scale projects. This accounts for both pilot trajectories taking longer than anticipated  as well as longer lead times towards larger projects after the pilot phase amongst others caused by permitting lead times  decision making and engineering.Half-year 2023 revenues came in at €3.7m (similar as in the first half-year of 2022)  lower than anticipated  caused by longer lead times to convert pilot projects into large full-scale projects. Full-year 2023 revenue is still expected to increase substantially from full-year 2022  but anticipated to come in lower than our previous outlook of €18m to €22m. For the full-year 2023  NX Filtration revises its outlook on total revenues to €10 to €14m. Gross margins remain strong at 58.9% in the first half-year of 2023  an increase compared to 55.3% in the first half-year of 2022.All underlying business drivers continue to develop in a very favorable direction  and our medium- and long term objectives on revenue growth and profitability remain unchanged.o 104 pilots projects in the first half-year of 2023  28% more than in the first half-year of 2022)  with strong results and therewith planting the seeds for future growth.o Strong and rapidly growing pipeline of commercial opportunities that is more than 50% larger than at the end of the first half of 2022.o Major steps forward with key OEMs (e.g. Veolia  Aqualia  Suez  Greentech and Nijhuis Saur) who further intensified their pilot programs  entered into cooperation agreements with NX Filtration  and started offering NX Filtration's products in full-scale projects.o Stronger than ever market trends to address global water issues  driven by droughts and pollution  causing many countries to implement regulations and investment plans: e.g. in France (53 new measures to combat droughts in summer period)  Spain (recently announced a €2.2bn package amongst others for wastewater reuse)  and in the US (proposal for the first-ever national drinking water standard for PFAS).o Strong recognition by industry institutions for our technology: Global Water Intelligence Distinction Awards for Water Technology Company of the Year and Water Project of the Year and Frost & Sullivan award for exceptional performance in the global industrial water and wastewater treatment membrane market.o On-track with our new megafactory: strong progress on the construction  with completion anticipated by Q1 2024 and start-up in H1 2024  within the anticipated Capex budget.Jeroen Pynenburg  CEO of NX Filtration  states:""I am thrilled to have joined NX Filtration and am excited to work with a global team that has such a strong drive and competence to make an impact on the water transition. Unfortunately today we have to update the market on the delay in our revenue growth. Although we have to adjust our full-year 2023 revenue outlook  I am highly confident that we are on the right track of our future growth path. The current delay in revenue growth is caused by longer lead times to convert pilots into large full-scale projects. This accounts for both pilot trajectories taking longer than anticipated  as well as longer lead times towards larger projects after the pilot phase amongst others caused by permitting lead times  decision making and engineering.We remain closely collaborating with our customers and continue to be positive on the conversion of our pilots. Our major opportunities that we had planned to deliver in the first half of 2023 are still part of our pipeline today. In fact  the underlying drivers for our business are stronger than ever: the market is developing very favorably  our pipeline continues to grow  and we experience great traction with major customers that are clearly entering the next stage of roll-out of our technology. We put our shoulders to the wheel and continue to stick to our medium- and long-term objectives.""NX Filtration's 2023 half-year report will be published on 29 August 2023 and will be available on the Investor Relations section of the website www.nxfiltration.com.About NX FiltrationNX Filtration is a provider of direct nanofiltration membrane technology for producing pure and affordable water to improve quality of life.

(Euronext Amsterdam: NXFIL)  the global provider of breakthrough direct nanofiltration (dNF) technology for pure and affordable water with strong sustainability benefits  today reports its half-year 2023 revenue and increasing lead-time in pilot conversion  resulting in an adjusted full-year 2023 revenue outlook. NX Filtration is experiencing a delay in revenue growth that is caused by longer lead times to convert pilot projects into largefull-scaleprojects. This accounts for both pilot trajectories taking longer than anticipated  as well as longer lead times towards larger projects after the pilot phase amongst others caused by permitting lead times  decision making and engineering. Half-year2023 revenues came in at €3.7m (similar as in the first half-year of 2022)  lower than anticipated  caused by longer lead times to convert pilot projects into large full-scale projects. Full-year2023 revenue is still expected to increase substantially from full-year 2022  but anticipated to come in lower than our previous outlook of €18m to €22m. For the full-year 2023  NX Filtration revises its outlook on total revenues to €10 to €14m. Gross margins remain strong at 58.9% in the first half-year of 2023  an increase compared to 55.3% in the first half-year of 2022. All underlying business drivers continue to develop in a very favorable direction  and our medium- and long term objectives on revenue growth and profitability remain unchanged. 104 pilots projects in the first half-year of 2023  28% more than in the first half-year of 2022)  with strong results and therewith planting the seeds for future growth. Strong and rapidly growing pipeline of commercial opportunities that is more than 50% larger than at the end of the first half of 2022. Major steps forward with key OEMs (e.g. Veolia  Aqualia  Suez  Greentech and Nijhuis Saur) who further intensified their pilot programs  entered into cooperation agreements with NX Filtration  and started offering NX Filtration's products in full-scale projects. Stronger than ever market trends to address global water issues  driven by droughts and pollution  causing many countries to implement regulations and investment plans: e.g. in France (53 new measures to combat droughts in summer period)  Spain (recently announced a €2.2bn package amongst others for wastewater reuse)  and in the US (proposal for the first- ever national drinking water standard for PFAS).Strong recognition by industry institutions for our technology : Global Water Intelligence Distinction Awards for Water Technology Company of the Year and Water Project of the Year and Frost & Sullivan award for exceptional performance in the global industrial water and wastewater treatment membrane market. On-track with our new megafactory : strong progress on the construction  with completion anticipated by Q1 2024 and start-up in H1 2024  within the anticipated Capex budget. Jeroen Pynenburg  CEO of NX Filtration  states: ""I am thrilled to have joined NX Filtration and am excited to work with a global team that has such a strong drive and competence to make an impact on the water transition. Unfortunately today we have to update the market on the delay in our revenue growth. Although we have to adjust our full-year 2023 revenue outlook  I am highly confident that we are on the right track of our future growth path. The current delay in revenue growth is caused by longer lead times to convert pilots into large full-scale projects. This accounts for both pilot trajectories taking longer than anticipated  as well as longer lead times towards larger projects after the pilot phase amongst others caused by permitting lead times  decision making and engineering. We remain closely collaborating with our customers and continue to be positive on the conversion of our pilots. Our major opportunities that we had planned to deliver in the first half of 2023 are still part of our pipeline today. In fact  the underlying drivers for our business are stronger than ever: the market is developing very favorably  our pipeline continues to grow  and we experience great traction with major customers that are clearly entering the next stage of roll-out of our technology. We put our shoulders to the wheel and continue to stick to our medium- and long- term objectives.""

A further update to be provided at the H1 2023 results in mid-AugustOperations updateProduction from the Moma Mine in Q2 2023 and H1 2023 was as follows:Q2 2023 Q2 2022 Q1 2023 H1 2023 H1 2022 tonnes % variance % variance tonnes % variance Excavated ore1 2 9 606 000 -5% 9% 18 380 000 -3% Grade1 2 4.03% -5% -8% 4.19% -4% Production HMC production 318 900 -10% 1% 633 900 -14% HMC processed 322 900 -12% 3% 637 600 -14% Ilmenite 221 300 -9% 8% 425 500 -15% Primary zircon 11 600 -15% 2% 23 000 -13% Rutile 1 900 -10% 12% 3 600 -10% Concentrates3 10 400 6% 3% 20 500 0% Shipments 285 100 48% 5% 556 800 31%1. Excavated ore tonnage and grade prior to any floor losses.2. Excavated ore volumes and grade for Q1 2023 are restated as 8 774 000 tonnes and 4.36% from 9 258 000 tonnes and 4.13% to exclude tailings excavated by WCP C.3. Concentrates include secondary zircon and mineral sands concentrate.Kenmare’s rolling 12-month LTIFR to 30 June 2023 was 0.18 per 200 000 hours worked (Q2 2022: 0.0)  with one Lost Time Injury recorded during Q2 2023. Kenmare is committed to building a strong  employee-led safety culture at Moma and is focused on improving safety leadership and ensuring best practices for identifying  assessing and mitigating risks at Moma are fully implemented.HMC production was 318 900 tonnes in Q2 2023  representing a 10% decrease compared to Q2 2022 (353 600 tonnes). This was a product of a 5% decrease in ore grades to 4.03% (Q2 2022: 4.23%) and a 5% decrease in excavated ore volumes to 9.6 million tonnes (Q2 2022: 10.1 million tonnes).HMC production in Q2 was impacted by:Poor power quality as interruptions from the grid and unplanned maintenance by Electricidade de Moçambique reduced mining operating hours.Lower recoveries at WCP A due to high slimes levels; recoveries have improved since June due to the introduction of supplementary clean water to the spirals  aiding separation efficiency.WCP B was unable to operate in a fully automated mode in Q2 because of a shortage of spares following the lightning strike in Q1. This impacted recoveries from mining  as did lower-than-expected grades. WCP B is now operating on a fully automated basis. Mining rates and recoveries were also impacted by buried root matter; while these conditions are not expected to recur in 2023  screening improvements have been implemented and successfully addressed this issue.WCP C undertook a planned transition through a tailings area from March 2023 to reach a new mining zone: this took longer than expected but was completed in June.Kenmare expects higher HMC production in H2 2023 benefitting from higher grades at WCP A  full production at WCP C and the resolution of the issues detailed above.All transportation of HMC from WCP B to the Mineral Separation Plant (“MSP”) is now being undertaken by the positive displacement pumps. H1 2023 has seen a significant improvement in the performance of the pumps which have consistently run at design throughputs and utilisations  eliminating the need for trucking of HMC.Ilmenite production was 221 300 tonnes  a 9% decrease compared to Q2 2022 (242 900 tonnes)  benefitting from drawdown of magnetic intermediate stocks compared to the 12% reduction in HMC processed.The Mine has experienced an under-recovery of ilmenite in the HMC at WCP B. The higher-grade fraction of ilmenite in an area of Pilivili appears more weathered  reducing the apparent density and magnetism of the material  impacting recoveries to final product. Further test work and calibration of equipment is ongoing to maximise the recoveries of this high TiO 2 ilmenite.Primary zircon production was 11 600 tonnes in Q2 2023  a 15% decrease compared to Q2 2022 (Q2 2022: 13 600 tonnes). Despite higher zircon grades in feed  particularly from WCP B  zircon production was affected by lower HMC availability. There was also a build of non-magnetic intermediate stocks  reducing zircon production  which is expected to unwind in H2 2023.The Rotary Uninterruptible Power Supply (“RUPS”) has not been operational in Q2  due to the failure of some electrical equipment. This has meant that grid power instability has impacted recoveries in the MSP. Design corrections have been identified and the RUPS is expected to fully resume operations in July.Rutile production was 1 900 tonnes  down 10% (Q2 2022: 2 100 tonnes). As with zircon  this reflects lower HMC processed  offset by increased rutile in feed.Concentrates production was 10 400 tonnes  up 6% (Q2 2022: 9 800 tonnes)  with higher content of monazite. Higher recoveries were also achieved in the secondary zircon circuit.Total shipments in Q2 2023 were 285 100 tonnes  a 48% increase compared to Q2 2022 (192 800 tonnes)  benefitting from increased shipping capacity in the period. Shipments comprised 258 100 tonnes of ilmenite  11 200 tonnes of primary zircon  3 500 tonnes of rutile  and 12 300 tonnes of concentrates. Shipments for H1 2023 were up 31% on the prior year to 556 800 tonnes (H1 2022: 424 300 tonnes).Closing stock of HMC at the end of Q2 2023 was 15 000 tonnes  compared to 19 000 tonnes at the end of Q1 2023. Closing stock of finished products at the end of Q2 2023 was 129 000 tonnes  compared to 169 300 tonnes at the end of Q1 2023  reflecting a drawdown of finished product inventories in Q2 2023.2023 guidanceIn the Q1 2023 Production Report  Kenmare indicated that it expected ilmenite production to be at the bottom of the original guidance. However  due to lower-than-expected production in Q2 2023  ilmenite guidance for 2023 is now updated as follows:Unit Updated2023 Guidance Original2023 Guidance Production Ilmenite tonnes 980 000 – 1 040 000 1 050 000 – 1 150 000 Primary zircon tonnes No change 51 000 – 57 000 Rutile tonnes No change 8 000 – 9 000 Concentrates1 tonnes No change 37 000 – 41 000 Costs Total cash operating costs $m No change 208 – 228Concentrates include secondary zircon and mineral sands concentrate.H2 2023 is anticipated to be a much stronger period of production  benefitting from increased grades and tonnes mined.It is expected that the shortfall in ilmenite will be partially offset by the increased content of zircon and rutile in feed  particularly from WCP B. The lower end of the revised ilmenite guidance range includes a conservative allowance for unexpected impacts on production.Total cash operating costs are anticipated to be in line with original guidance. Cash operating costs per tonne will be a function of lower production volumes and total cash operating costs.Market updateIlmenite prices and sales volumes remained stable in H1 2023.Downstream titanium pigment demand was subdued in Q2  as higher interest rates globally affected industrial activity and the housing markets in many regions. Underlying demand in China has not rebounded as quickly as expected  but domestic pigment production remains robust. As a result  pigment producers outside China are facing increased competition from Chinese pigment exports.Sustained production of pigment in China has supported the ilmenite market in Q2 2023. However  slower pigment market conditions reduced demand for high-grade feedstocks  due to lower chloride pigment utilisations. There has been continued disruption to and depletion of titanium feedstock mine supply globally; however  an increase in concentrates for processing in China has kept the market in balance.Lower demand for titanium pigment is likely to continue in the short term; however  Kenmare has contracted a high proportion of ilmenite sales in Q3 2023.Challenging macroeconomic conditions have softened demand for zircon. Ceramics producers are operating at reduced utilisation levels  leading to higher inventories. Reported zircon sand prices have remained stable  although spot prices for shipments to China and India softened in Q2 2023 and remain below contracted prices moving into Q3.Finance updateOn 19 May 2023  Kenmare paid its record 2022 final dividend of USc43.33 per share. This was the balancing payment of a 2022 full year dividend of USc54.31 per share  representing a dividend payout ratio of 25% of profit after tax  and up 66% from 2021.Following the 2022 final dividend distribution of $44.1 million and debt principal repayments of $15.7 million  cash and cash equivalents were $108.8 million as at 30 June 2023 (31 December 2022: $108.3 million)  while gross bank loans and lease obligations  including accrued interest  were $66.6 million (31 December 2022: $82.6 million).Accordingly  as at 30 June 2023  Kenmare’s net cash increased by $16.5 million to $42.2 million  compared to $25.7 million net cash at 31 December 2022.Kenmare continues to generate strong free cashflow and in line with its capital allocation policy  the Company is considering a share buyback of approximately $30 million  subject to trading conditions  business performance and Board and other necessary approvals.

We are therefore updating guidance for ilmenite production for the full year. However  guidance for other products remains unchanged. We anticipate significantly stronger production in H2 2023  supported by higher grades and increased tonnes mined.Cash generation has remained strong  supported by product pricing and shipments. In addition to paying record dividends and scheduled debt repayments  the business has continued to build cash. In line with our capital allocation policy  we are considering a share buyback of approximately $30 million.

A further update to be provided at the H1 2023 results in mid-AugustOperations updateProduction from the Moma Mine in Q2 2023 and H1 2023 was as follows:Q2 2023 Q2 2022 Q1 2023 H1 2023 H1 2022 tonnes % variance % variance tonnes % variance Excavated ore1 2 9 606 000 -5% 9% 18 380 000 -3% Grade1 2 4.03% -5% -8% 4.19% -4% Production HMC production 318 900 -10% 1% 633 900 -14% HMC processed 322 900 -12% 3% 637 600 -14% Ilmenite 221 300 -9% 8% 425 500 -15% Primary zircon 11 600 -15% 2% 23 000 -13% Rutile 1 900 -10% 12% 3 600 -10% Concentrates3 10 400 6% 3% 20 500 0% Shipments 285 100 48% 5% 556 800 31%1. Excavated ore tonnage and grade prior to any floor losses.2. Excavated ore volumes and grade for Q1 2023 are restated as 8 774 000 tonnes and 4.36% from 9 258 000 tonnes and 4.13% to exclude tailings excavated by WCP C.3. Concentrates include secondary zircon and mineral sands concentrate.Kenmare’s rolling 12-month LTIFR to 30 June 2023 was 0.18 per 200 000 hours worked (Q2 2022: 0.0)  with one Lost Time Injury recorded during Q2 2023. Kenmare is committed to building a strong  employee-led safety culture at Moma and is focused on improving safety leadership and ensuring best practices for identifying  assessing and mitigating risks at Moma are fully implemented.HMC production was 318 900 tonnes in Q2 2023  representing a 10% decrease compared to Q2 2022 (353 600 tonnes). This was a product of a 5% decrease in ore grades to 4.03% (Q2 2022: 4.23%) and a 5% decrease in excavated ore volumes to 9.6 million tonnes (Q2 2022: 10.1 million tonnes).HMC production in Q2 was impacted by:Poor power quality as interruptions from the grid and unplanned maintenance by Electricidade de Moçambique reduced mining operating hours.Lower recoveries at WCP A due to high slimes levels; recoveries have improved since June due to the introduction of supplementary clean water to the spirals  aiding separation efficiency.WCP B was unable to operate in a fully automated mode in Q2 because of a shortage of spares following the lightning strike in Q1. This impacted recoveries from mining  as did lower-than-expected grades. WCP B is now operating on a fully automated basis. Mining rates and recoveries were also impacted by buried root matter; while these conditions are not expected to recur in 2023  screening improvements have been implemented and successfully addressed this issue.WCP C undertook a planned transition through a tailings area from March 2023 to reach a new mining zone: this took longer than expected but was completed in June.Kenmare expects higher HMC production in H2 2023 benefitting from higher grades at WCP A  full production at WCP C and the resolution of the issues detailed above.All transportation of HMC from WCP B to the Mineral Separation Plant (“MSP”) is now being undertaken by the positive displacement pumps. H1 2023 has seen a significant improvement in the performance of the pumps which have consistently run at design throughputs and utilisations  eliminating the need for trucking of HMC.Ilmenite production was 221 300 tonnes  a 9% decrease compared to Q2 2022 (242 900 tonnes)  benefitting from drawdown of magnetic intermediate stocks compared to the 12% reduction in HMC processed.The Mine has experienced an under-recovery of ilmenite in the HMC at WCP B. The higher-grade fraction of ilmenite in an area of Pilivili appears more weathered  reducing the apparent density and magnetism of the material  impacting recoveries to final product. Further test work and calibration of equipment is ongoing to maximise the recoveries of this high TiO 2 ilmenite.Primary zircon production was 11 600 tonnes in Q2 2023  a 15% decrease compared to Q2 2022 (Q2 2022: 13 600 tonnes). Despite higher zircon grades in feed  particularly from WCP B  zircon production was affected by lower HMC availability. There was also a build of non-magnetic intermediate stocks  reducing zircon production  which is expected to unwind in H2 2023.The Rotary Uninterruptible Power Supply (“RUPS”) has not been operational in Q2  due to the failure of some electrical equipment. This has meant that grid power instability has impacted recoveries in the MSP. Design corrections have been identified and the RUPS is expected to fully resume operations in July.Rutile production was 1 900 tonnes  down 10% (Q2 2022: 2 100 tonnes). As with zircon  this reflects lower HMC processed  offset by increased rutile in feed.Concentrates production was 10 400 tonnes  up 6% (Q2 2022: 9 800 tonnes)  with higher content of monazite. Higher recoveries were also achieved in the secondary zircon circuit.Total shipments in Q2 2023 were 285 100 tonnes  a 48% increase compared to Q2 2022 (192 800 tonnes)  benefitting from increased shipping capacity in the period. Shipments comprised 258 100 tonnes of ilmenite  11 200 tonnes of primary zircon  3 500 tonnes of rutile  and 12 300 tonnes of concentrates. Shipments for H1 2023 were up 31% on the prior year to 556 800 tonnes (H1 2022: 424 300 tonnes).Closing stock of HMC at the end of Q2 2023 was 15 000 tonnes  compared to 19 000 tonnes at the end of Q1 2023. Closing stock of finished products at the end of Q2 2023 was 129 000 tonnes  compared to 169 300 tonnes at the end of Q1 2023  reflecting a drawdown of finished product inventories in Q2 2023.2023 guidanceIn the Q1 2023 Production Report  Kenmare indicated that it expected ilmenite production to be at the bottom of the original guidance. However  due to lower-than-expected production in Q2 2023  ilmenite guidance for 2023 is now updated as follows:Unit Updated 2023 Guidance Original 2023 Guidance Production Ilmenite tonnes 980 000 – 1 040 000 1 050 000 – 1 150 000 Primary zircon tonnes No change 51 000 – 57 000 Rutile tonnes No change 8 000 – 9 000 Concentrates1 tonnes No change 37 000 – 41 000 Costs Total cash operating costs $m No change 208 – 228Concentrates include secondary zircon and mineral sands concentrate.H2 2023 is anticipated to be a much stronger period of production  benefitting from increased grades and tonnes mined.It is expected that the shortfall in ilmenite will be partially offset by the increased content of zircon and rutile in feed  particularly from WCP B. The lower end of the revised ilmenite guidance range includes a conservative allowance for unexpected impacts on production.Total cash operating costs are anticipated to be in line with original guidance. Cash operating costs per tonne will be a function of lower production volumes and total cash operating costs.Market updateIlmenite prices and sales volumes remained stable in H1 2023.Downstream titanium pigment demand was subdued in Q2  as higher interest rates globally affected industrial activity and the housing markets in many regions.

Revenues were Euro 543.9 million  with a splendid growth of +31.0% at current exchange rates (+30.5% at constant exchange rates) compared to 1H 2022;All geographical areas were very positive: Americas +23.9%  Europe +22.6%  Italy +23.7%  Asia +55.6%;Significant increase in revenue in both sales channels: retail +41.6%  wholesale +15.8%;The excellent half year that has just ended  the more than punctual progress of winter deliveries  and the favour we breathe around our brand and product proposition  allow us to revise our revenue growth estimate for 2023 upwards  from +15% to a range between +17% and +19%;Chanel together with Brunello Cucinelli in the prestigious Lanificio Cariaggi: a very special collaboration that further enhances the value of the entire Italian supply chain. Brunello Cucinelli  Executive Chairman and Creative Director of the Fashion House commented: The first half of this year ended with more than excellent results. We like to think that we are reaping what the brand stands for in its style and in the way of conceiving the balance between work and the relationship with creation. Thanks to the strong demand for handcrafted and exclusive products  we continue to have a very positive outlook on the absolute luxury world market. As a result  we are very confident about the future performance of the business for the current year  where we expect to close the year with an increase in sales of between +17 and +19%. Given the excellent sell-out of the Spring-Summer 2023 collections and the significant order intake for the Men's Spring-Summer 2024 collection so far  we expect a healthy growth of around +10% next year. 1Solomeo  July 13  2023 - The Board of Directors of Brunello Cucinelli S.p.A. - a ""Casa di Moda"" operating in the luxury goods sector  listed on the Italian Stock Exchange (now Euronext) - today reviewed the preliminary sales for the first half of 2023  in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board. *** The first half of 2023 was really very good for us. The sales growth of +31.0%  which exceeded our expectations at the beginning of the year  was achieved thanks to the positive and synergetic contribution of both sales channels and was  in our opinion  very well distributed and balanced geographically. We feel we can say that at this time the allure around the brand and our product offering are particularly appreciated internationally  in a market context that is very favourable for the absolute luxury segment  and characterised in terms of taste by the search for sobriety of style. In the second quarter we achieved a turnover of Euro 278.6 million  up +27.5% year-on-year  offering further proof of the excellent health of all core markets in this first part of the year. Revenues for the first two quarters of 2023 are very similar in absolute terms  producing a half-year result that is  both in terms of channel mix (retail 63%  wholesale 37%) and geographic mix (Americas 35%  Europe 37%  Asia 28%)  very close with our year-end expectations. Specifically  the American market shows a structurally increasing demand for the high-end luxury segment  which has allowed us to achieve a very important growth of +23.9% in the first half of 2023. The increase in Q2 was very solid  even considering last year's basis of comparison  with Q2 2022 showing an increase of +67%. The particular dynamism of the American customer and its search for special garments contributed not only to the results in the domestic market  but also to the strong growth in Europe and Italy  which reported half-yearly growth of +22.6% and +23.7% respectively. In Asia  and in particular in China  we report very high value growth of +55.6% in the first six months of 2023  always bearing in mind that our share of sales in these markets is still limited. At product level  sales in the quarter were driven by the excellentsell-outs of the Spring-Summer2023 collections for both men's and women's  in both the retail and wholesale channels  generating a very interesting volume of reassortments during the season. In the second quarter in particular  the more than punctual delivery progress on the Fall Winter 2023 collections contributed to the excellent performance in the wholesale channel  meeting the desire of many customers to receive the new products as soon as possible. Throughout the semester  we still felt a slight shortage of high-end products on the market. The very positive feedback received following the presentations of the Autumn Winter 2023 collections also allows us to be confident about the quality of the product in our boutique and multi-brand customers in the second half of this year. The order collection for the Spring-Summer2024 men's collection is almost completed with important results  having been warmly welcomed by customers and journalists during the recent Pitti Uomo and Milan Fashion Week. 2The results achieved in the first half-year and the positive outlook for the coming months allow us to update our growth estimate for the whole of 2023  forecasting an increase in revenue of between +17% and +19%  compared to the previous expectation of +15%. As far as the second half of the year is concerned  we therefore envisage significant growth and strong consolidation  with a balanced increase over the excellent second half of 2022. Indeed  we recall that last year we described the first quarter as 'good'  the second quarter as 'more than good'  and the third and fourth quarters as 'excellent'. *** Agreement with Chanel to enhance Cariaggi's excellence With the agreement signed on 23 May 2023  the prestigious Maison Chanel acquired a minority shareholding in the prestigious Lanificio Cariaggi S.p.A.  excellence in the supply and processing of cashmere of the highest quality. As a result of this transaction  Brunello Cucinelli's shareholding in Lanificio Cariaggi went from 43% to 24.5%; with the sale of 6% of the capital by the Cariaggi family to Chanel  the company's share capital is now owned 51% by the Cariaggi family and 24.5% each by Brunello Cucinelli and Chanel. We are particularly honoured by this project  not least because for the first time the very prestigious Chanel  'a benchmark in style  manner and kindness'  is collaborating with another brand within a manufacturing company  sharing the same understanding of the value of exclusivity and craftsmanship at the very top end of the luxury market. We also believe that this agreement can contribute to the protection and further development of a symbol of Italian manufacturing excellence in the world such as Cariaggi. Brunello Cucinelli  on the occasion of the signing  commented as follows: ""I am particularly happy on this day of truly historic importance. The agreement we have reached represents a splendid diadem that will enhance the value of the entire Italian supply chain  enormously pleased by the fact that a Maison of absolute excellence in global fashion like Chanel has chosen to invest in Made in Italy by sharing with us the beautiful Cariaggi wool mill project. I therefore consider it a joyful day of celebration  which we believe will be followed by years full of great achievements by virtue of this very  very special collaboration. After all  with Chanel we are in the presence of a true international icon of style  elegance and beauty and I am immensely honoured that they have decided to work with us. This agreement  I am certain  will constitute for all of us the best possible leaven for magnificent growth as humans  not just professionals  over the coming decades. By virtue of all these healthy and concrete elements  I sincerely thank the esteemed Cariaggi family  to whom my family and I have always been tied in a virtuous relationship of shared values  and the equally esteemed Bruno Pavlovsky  President of fashion at the prestigious French Maison  which gives this memorable accord an added value of great beauty."" 3The launch of Brunello Cucinelli Fragrances: the identity of perfumes and the beginning of distribution After three years of work on the creation of our first two fragrances  and about three months after the presentation press conference  we have started to receive the first product feedback  hand in hand with the activation of distribution in the specialised channel. The perfumes are currently on sale  besides in our direct boutiques in Europe  in a beautiful group of 90 independent  high-end Italian perfumeries. We are truly honoured by the preference given to us by these very important multibrand clients  our initial distribution target. With great pleasure  we can now highlight their positive feedback of the fragrances  which they described as modern  contemporary and distinctive. Many loyal customers of our boutiques share the feeling of finding in the fresh  delicate and precious notes of our men and women's fragrances the same idea of taste and quiet refinement that they seek in our clothes. At product level  for these first two references  our research was guided by the desire to transfer the brand identity into olfactory notes  resulting in an 'essential' product capable of representing us over time  like a 'cashmere choker'. We believe that the initial comments reinforce our idea that we have succeeded in activating a new sense  consistent with the sobriety  the quality and the exclusivity naturally associated with our brand. Beginning in the second half of July  with a focus on the domestic market  the advertising campaign will also begin to take shape  which was considered by industry players to be highly original for the category even at the time of its presentation. During the summer we will begin distribution in the multi-brand channel in the rest of Europe  seeking  with the same country-by-country attention  a presence in spaces that for their beauty  relevance and exclusive profile can represent the best local showcases for our product. We also expect to start serving the North American and Middle Eastern markets from the autumn  and the Asian markets with the beginning of the new year. The completion of the distribution will still take several months  but we have decided to devote the 'right amount of time' to this aspect as well  considering it essential to build a solid distribution platform  capable of guaranteeing in the long term a clear connotation of exclusivity  and a possible materiality of our business in this category. *** 4",neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.82,0.1,0.08,True,English,"['Preliminary Net Revenues', 'first half', 'Thursday', 'Board', 'Directors', 'Brunello Cucinelli S.p.A.', 'International Financial Reporting Standards', 'entire Italian supply chain', 'International Accounting Standards Board', 'absolute luxury world market', 'Italian Stock Exchange', 'luxury goods sector', 'absolute luxury segment', 'MODA BRUNELLO CUCINELLI', 'constant exchange rates', 'prestigious Lanificio Cariaggi', 'recent Pitti Uomo', 'high-end luxury segment', 'current exchange rates', 'Milan Fashion Week', 'first two quarters', 'first six months', 'Fall Winter 2023 collections', 'Autumn Winter 2023 collections', 'significant order intake', 'Casa di Moda', 'punctual delivery progress', 'revenue growth estimate', 'high value growth', 'excellent half year', 'punctual progress', 'winter deliveries', 'Fashion House', 'Spring-Summer 2023 collections', 'Spring-Summer2023 collections', 'high-end products', 'first half', 'absolute terms', 'splendid growth', 'healthy growth', 'excellent health', 'first part', 'important growth', 'strong growth', 'half-yearly growth', 'excellent performance', 'market context', 'American market', 'domestic market', 'order collection', 'second half', 'Press Release', 'geographical areas', 'special collaboration', 'Executive Chairman', 'Creative Director', 'strong demand', 'exclusive products', 'future performance', 'synergetic contribution', 'channel mix', 'geographic mix', 'increasing demand', 'particular dynamism', 'American customer', 'special garments', 'wholesale channels', 'interesting volume', 'new products', 'slight shortage', 'current year', 'excellent results', 'sales growth', 'Significant increase', 'product proposition', 'product offering', 'product level', 'positive outlook', 'Spring-Summer 2024 collection', 'second quarter', 'many customers', 'positive feedback', 'multi-brand customers', 'important results', 'sales channels', 'preliminary sales', 'core markets', 'year-end expectations', 'last year', 'preliminary revenues', 'half-year result', 'Spring-Summer2024 men', 'Directors', '1H', 'Americas', 'Europe', 'Italy', 'Asia', 'retail', 'favour', 'range', 'Chanel', 'style', 'way', 'balance', 'work', 'relationship', 'creation', 'handcrafted', 'business', 'Solomeo', 'Euronext', 'accordance', 'IFRS', 'beginning', 'opinion', 'time', 'allure', 'taste', 'search', 'sobriety', 'turnover', 'proof', 'Q2', 'basis', 'comparison', 'China', 'mind', 'share', 'excellentsell-outs', 'women', 'reassortments', 'season', 'desire', 'presentations', 'quality', 'boutique', 'journalists']",2023-07-13,2023-07-14,marketscreener.com

The full report is attached to this release and will be available on Volta’s website shortly (www.voltafinance.com).PERFORMANCE and PORTFOLIO ACTIVITYAfter a very strong performance in May  the June performance of Volta Finance settled for a modest 0.0%. Looking back at the fund’s performance for the first half of the year though  Volta returned +11% which we believe is a very strong number.The performance of Volta was supported by the generous carry that CLOs offer indeed  but it was ultimately the confirmation that the asset class successfully managed to withstand the volatility induced by rates and the banking sector jitters.Volta’s underlying sub asset classes monthly performances** were as follow: -3.7% for Bank Balance Sheet transactions  +1.9% for CLO Equity tranches  +0.5% for CLO Debt tranches and 0% for Cash Corporate Credit and ABS (which represent slightly less than 2.0% of the fund’s NAV). This month  being long USD against Euro was detrimental to the performance and contributed to circa -0.5% of the monthly performance.The fund’s performance is mainly driven by the solid cash flows paid by Volta’s assets on a quarterly basis. June is usually a very quiet month in terms of payments but on a rolling-6-month basis Volta received the equivalent of €23.5m  ie. a 20.1% annualized cash flow to NAV. We expect a very solid month in July in terms of CLO Equity payments as we observed yet again that CLO managers were able to -modestly- increase the WAS (Weighted Average Spread) of their underlying loan pools (mainly using loan prepayments proceeds to re-deploy in fresh loans with higher spreads).In terms of risk  a bit more defaults materialized both in the European and in the US loan market in June. At the end of June 2023  the usual measure of default rate was respectively at 1.0% and 1.7% for European and US loans (we ended 2022 with respectively 0.4 and 0.7%). This evolution  although negative  is still in line with our view that loan default rates should increase in 2023 but at a pace that will remain manageable and that will not significantly impact CLO equity distributions). For the reminder  we believe that 2023 default rates should remain below 2% in Europe and below 3% in the US.As expected  we are now clearly seeing a bias toward higher prepayment rates for both US and European loan market. After nearly 10% prepayment rate in 2022 we are now running prepayments at a pace that is closer to 15%. We can illustrate how strategic prepayments are to CLO structures with some simple Math. Taking the assumption that loan reinvestments are implemented at a cash price of 96px on average  said prepayments (investors get 100px back) generate 0.60% of par creation per year ((100-96)% * 15%). When using a conservative 50% recovery rate for defaults  0.6% of par creation can essentially compensate 1.2% defaults per year. We believe that this mechanism of par creation has been essential in supporting CLO managers to absorb part of the stress observed in the last 15 months.For sure  this mechanism alone will not insulate CLOs from the expected increase in default rates  but it will contribute to soften their impact and to eventually maintain Equity payments. Since we see more loans maturing in 2025/26 rather than 2024  we expect such prepayment rate to get to 20% in 2024  which shall generate even more par creation next year. It shall also help increasing WAS of the underlying loan pools and ultimately support CLO Equity payments.We believe that those factors combined with higher interest rates may produce higher cashflow generations in the coming quarters.As of end of June 2023  Volta’s NAV was €231.9m  i.e. €6.34 per share.*It should be noted that approximately 6.18% of Volta’s GAV comprises investments for which the relevant NAVs as at the month-end date are normally available only after Volta’s NAV has already been published. Volta’s policy is to publish its NAV on as timely a basis as possible to provide shareholders with Volta’s appropriately up-to-date NAV information. Consequently  such investments are valued using the most recently available NAV for each fund or quoted price for such subordinated notes. The most recently available fund NAV or quoted price was 1.13% as at 31 May 2023  5.05% as at 31March 2023.** “performances” of asset classesare calculated as the Dietz-performance of the assets in each bucket  taking into account the Mark-to-Market of the assets at period ends  payments received from the assets over the period  and ignoring changes in cross-currency rates. Nevertheless  some residual currency effects could impact the aggregate value of the portfolio when aggregating each bucket.CONTACTSFor the Investment ManagerAXA Investment Managers ParisSerge Demayserge.demay@axa-im.com+33 (0) 1 44 45 84 47Company Secretary and AdministratorBNP Paribas S.A  Guernsey Branchguernsey.bp2s.volta.cosec@bnpparibas.com+44 (0) 1481 750 853Corporate BrokerCenkos Securities plcAndrew WorneDaniel Balabanoff+44 (0) 20 7397 8900*****ABOUT VOLTA FINANCE LIMITEDVolta Finance Limited is incorporated in Guernsey under The Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 (as amended) and listed on Euronext Amsterdam and the London Stock Exchange's Main Market for listed securities.
