The assets are expected to generate around €3 billion in interest. A large chunk of the funds is held at the Belgian settlement giant Euroclear  where it generated nearly €750 million in taxable profit by the first quarter of this year  according to the clearing house’s own data.The EU leaders have repeatedly called to use the funds ‘to rebuild’ Ukraine and agreed last month to begin work on a windfall tax to acquire the interest generated on the funds.However  ECB President Christine Lagarde warned during a meeting on Thursday that a windfall tax could undermine the euro and lead to a re-think among reserve holders  Bloomberg reported  quoting people familiar with the discussions.Lagarde reportedly said that the amount at stake was far greater than the few billions that the move would generate for Ukraine. Any decision should only happen if the G7 nations  among which are Canada  Japan  the United Kingdom and the United States  are on board too  she added.European commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis reportedly countered Lagarde’s arguments by saying that the windfall option does not affect Russia’s assets themselves nor does it apply to the EU’s role in safekeeping securities. Lagarde is said to have shaken her head at Dombrovskis’ counterarguments.Some member states support Lagarde’s position while others believe that it was only a question of how to advance  and not if  Bloomberg concludes.Moscow has repeatedly described any seizure of its assets by Western governments as theft and illegal under international law.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section,neutral,0.1,0.84,0.06,negative,0.01,0.08,0.92,True,English,"['Russian assets', 'EU', 'Bloomberg', 'European commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis', 'Belgian settlement giant Euroclear', 'The European Central Bank', 'ECB President Christine Lagarde', 'Dombrovskis’ counterarguments', 'anonymous sources', 'Russian state', 'military operation', 'large chunk', 'taxable profit', 'first quarter', 'clearing house', 'windfall tax', 'reserve holders', 'G7 nations', 'United Kingdom', 'United States', 'windfall option', 'safekeeping securities', 'member states', 'Western governments', 'international law', 'business section', 'EU sanctions', 'EU leaders', 'Russian assets', 'bloc', 'plans', 'profits', 'Bloomberg', 'Friday', 'reserves', 'beginning', 'Moscow', 'Ukraine', 'interest', 'funds', 'year', 'data', 'work', 'meeting', 'Thursday', 'think', 'people', 'discussions', 'amount', 'stake', 'billions', 'move', 'decision', 'Canada', 'Japan', 'board', 'role', 'head', 'position', 'others', 'question', 'seizure', 'stories', 'economy', 'finance']",2023-07-15,2023-07-16,rt.com
