(Euronext Amsterdam: VVY; NL00150002Q7) (Vivoryon)  a clinical stage company focused on the discovery and development of small molecule medicines to modulate the activity and stability of pathologically altered proteins  today provided a clinical development update highlighting the progress of its unique N3pE-amyloid-targeting small molecule varoglutamstat in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The update included data presented at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference (AAIC)  being held July 16-20  2023  in Amsterdam  the Netherlands. The Company is also providing updates from the ongoing clinical Phase 2 studies VIVIAD in Europe and VIVA-MIND in the U.S.“In light of the renewed momentum within the Alzheimer’s disease drug development space with the first full approval of a potentially disease-modifying medication  I am particularly encouraged by the opportunity to be testing varoglutamstat within our Phase 2 Proof-of-Concept trial ” commented Dr. Howard Feldman  Professor of Neurosciences and Director of the ADCS at UC San Diego School of Medicine  and the VIVA-MIND study director. “As a small molecule alternative that can conveniently be taken at home and potentially without comparable risks of brain swelling and bleeding seen with amyloid lowering monoclonal antibodies  varoglutamstat may hold significant advantages in safety and ease of use by patients.”“As varoglutamstat continues to progress through clinical development  we are very pleased to report that VIVIAD’s independent Data Safety Monitoring Board has determined that the VIVIAD study can continue without modifications and no additional meetings will be required until the meeting scheduled at study completion ” added Dr. Ulrich Dauer  CEO of Vivoryon. “This is the first time varoglutamstat long-term safety data from patients suffering from Alzheimer’s disease with a treatment duration of more than a year and up to two years have been reviewed independently. Our path forward both from a clinical and regulatory perspective is promising and we see the outcomes of this meeting as an important point of validation for our approach. The growing evidence supporting varoglutamstat as a potential novel medicine to treat Alzheimer’s disease with a favorable safety profile is incredibly encouraging  particularly as we think about its positioning within the broader treatment landscape. We look forward to reporting on the final data  which we expect to read out in the first quarter of 2024. In tandem  given the excellent progress of VIVIAD  we have decided to initiate preparations for an open label extension study  which  following positive VIVIAD study outcome  could provide a long-term therapeutic option to patients who have been treated under VIVIAD or VIVA-MIND protocols.”Varoglutamstat Clinical Program:Varoglutamstat is a differentiated investigational small-molecule medicine in development to treat Alzheimer’s disease. It is currently being investigated in two large Phase 2 studies  VIVIAD (NCT04498650) in Europe and VIVA-MIND (NCT03919162) in the U.S.  where it continues to show evidence of a favorable safety profile at the therapeutic dose of 600 mg twice daily (BID)  a dose demonstrated to result in a target occupancy of nearly 90%.Varoglutamstat is designed to prevent N3pE- Abeta formation  rather than aiming to clear existing plaques  making it an intervention upstream of other approaches such as monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Through a second mode of action  varoglutamstat also modulates neuroinflammation via the CCL2 pathway  which  in turn  has an impact on tau pathology.Varoglutamstat was shown to be well-tolerated in both a completed first-in-human Phase 1 study in over 200 participants and the subsequent first-in-patient Phase 2a study  SAPHIR (NCT02389413)  which enrolled 120 patients suffering from early AD. Importantly  after only 12 weeks of treatment  this study showed evidence of improving not only pathological hallmarks  but also synaptic function and connectivity  cognition  memory and attention in AD patients  including statistically significant changes from baseline in working memory.VIVIAD (NCT04498650) is a state-of-the-art Phase 2b study being conducted in Europe and designed to evaluate the safety  tolerability  and efficacy of varoglutamstat in 259 (final number of randomized participants) subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild Alzheimer’s disease (AD).Data f rom AAIC 2023: P1-18 / P1-904 Poster #82642 – “VIVIAD  a Phase 2b Study Investigating Varoglutamstat in Patients with MCI or Mild AD: Analysis of Baseline Cognition Data.” These data demonstrate that Vivoryon’s strategy of recruiting individuals with evidence of baseline deficits on the WAIS-IV Coding test  a well-known measure of cognitive function  successfully enriches study cohorts with respect to deficits in attention and working memory  enabling reliable assessment of potential cognitive improvement after treatment. A new enrichment strategy was applied in the VIVIAD study to ensure that study participants exhibited rescuable deficits in attention and working memory at baseline. VIVIAD uses the WAIS-IV Coding test to select patients with rescuable cognitive deficits in the target domains. The study inclusion criteria encompassed a score of at least 0.5 SD (standard deviations) below age-adjusted mean on the WAIS-IV Coding subtest. Approximately 20% of screened patients did not meet the inclusion criteria during screening due to good performance on the WAIS-IV Coding test. In addition  for selecting patients with mild disease  the MMSE cut-off was set at 20  leading to 8% of patients not meeting the inclusion criteria due to falling under this cut-off value. The WAIS-IV Coding test performance shows reasonably good correlation with the measures that comprise the primary outcome  i.e. detection (DET)  identification (IDN) and one back test (ONB) of the Cogstate NTB as judged by the Spearman correlation coefficients of 0.27  0.44  and 0.47  respectively  using the blinded baseline data of all randomized patients.P1-18 / P1-904 Poster #82642 – “VIVIAD  a Phase 2b Study Investigating Varoglutamstat in Patients with MCI or Mild AD: Analysis of Baseline Cognition Data.” These data demonstrate that Vivoryon’s strategy of recruiting individuals with evidence of baseline deficits on the WAIS-IV Coding test  a well-known measure of cognitive function  successfully enriches study cohorts with respect to deficits in attention and working memory  enabling reliable assessment of potential cognitive improvement after treatment.The use of MMSE and WAIS-IV Coding test  together with inclusion criteria based on CSF biomarkers (Abeta and p-tau) are valuable tools in identifying and recruiting patients with MCI or mild AD who already have deficits in working memory and attention.Safety Results: Data from all 259 randomized patients showed no clinical signs of ARIA at the cutoff date of June 14  2023. Both the total number of SAEs and the discontinuation rate were considerably lower than the respective numbers at the 800 mg BID varoglutamstat dose in Vivoryon’s completed Phase 2a SAPHIR study  while retaining a similar level of target inhibition at the dosing in both studies.Data from all 259 randomized patients showed no clinical signs of ARIA at the cutoff date of June 14  2023. Both the total number of SAEs and the discontinuation rate were considerably lower than the respective numbers at the 800 mg BID varoglutamstat dose in Vivoryon’s completed Phase 2a SAPHIR study  while retaining a similar level of target inhibition at the dosing in both studies. After carefully reviewing the updated safety data  the independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) decided in its recent meeting on June 22  2023  that the study should continue as planned and that no additional DSMB meeting will be required until study completion.The study is on track for the final data readout in Q1/2024.Open label extension (OLE) study: Vivoryon commenced preparations for an OLE study to provide a long-term treatment option to patients after completion of treatment under the VIVIAD or VIVA-MIND protocol. The launch of the OLE study is contingent on the outcome of VIVIAD.VIVA-MIND (NCT03919162) is a complementary Phase 2 study for varoglutamstat conducted in the U.S. which seeks to enroll 180 patients with early AD into the Phase 2a adaptive dose finding portion and enroll a further 234 patients in the Phase 2b portion of the study.Study Updates: The first cohort was fully randomized into the study as planned and the study is now recruiting participants into the second cohort  with 19 sites open across the U.S. In its June 12  2023  meeting  the study’s independent DSMB recommended to continue the study without modification  supporting the rationale for accelerated uptitration to 600 mg BID dosing. The Company anticipates a decision on final trial size following the data readout of the VIVIAD study. Vivoryon intends to provide a study update in Q4/2023.The first cohort was fully randomized into the study as planned and the study is now recruiting participants into the second cohort  with 19 sites open across the U.S.###About VIVIADVIVIAD is a state-of-the-art Phase 2b study being conducted in Europe and designed to evaluate the safety  tolerability and efficacy of varoglutamstat in 250 subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild AD compared to placebo over the course of 48 to 96 weeks of treatment. The highest dose investigated in the study (600 mg twice daily) was selected by an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) as final dose after the dose-escalation portion of the study. Enrollment was completed with a total of 259 participants and the study was adapted in 2022 to enable an average treatment duration of ~82 weeks. The primary endpoint is a composite of the Neuropsychological Test Battery (NTB) focusing on changes in working memory and attention with secondary endpoints including multiple cognitive  safety and biomarker assessments.About VIVA-MINDVIVA-MIND is a complementary Phase 2 study being conducted in the U.S.  coordinated by the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS) at the University of California San Diego (UCSD) School of Medicine and supported by the National Institute on Aging (NIA)  part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) with a $15 million grant (NIA award number R01AG061146). The study seeks to enroll 180 patients into the Phase 2a adaptive dose-finding portion with the Phase 2b portion  enrolling an additional 234 patients treated at the selected dose for at least 72 weeks  with a total of 414 patients being treated on stable doses of varoglutamstat for 18 months. The VIVA-MIND design was adapted in 2022 to enable all 180 patients in the Phase 2a portion to be treated for at least 72 weeks  allowing for the opportunity to progress seamlessly to a potential Phase 3 study. The flexible study design is aimed at increasing the probability of success by broadening option space for adjustments in clinical development based on learnings from VIVIAD and other developments in the field. The primary endpoint for this study is clinical dementia rating scale - sum of boxes (CDR-SB)  an established approvable endpoint measuring a combination of cognitive abilities and activities of daily living. Secondary efficacy endpoints include quantitative EEG theta power  ADAS-Cog 13 and others. Exploratory endpoints include Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)  Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)  quantitative EEG alpha power  relative QPCT activity in CSF and others.About Vivoryon Therapeutics N.V.Vivoryon is a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on developing innovative small molecule-based medicines.

27821,EuroNext,Bing API,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4617369-euronext-stock-attractive-valuation-buy-again,Euronext Stock: Attractive Valuation  Buy Again (OTCMKTS:EUXTF),We appreciate that trading volume is easing on a monthly basis. Euronext appears attractive  as it trades at a 40% discount on a P/E basis vs. its peers group. We confirm our buy rating. Buy-side hedge professionals conducting fundamental  income oriented ...,"Luis AlvarezSince our last update  ""Euronext Continues To Deleverage "" the company stock price declined by an additional 10% (OTCPK:EUXTF). Today  we are not providing a buy case recap; however  we would like to focus on a few positive  positive catalysts that might drive Euronext re-rating over the medium-term horizon. Before going into detail  we should report that the company has done a relevant job diversifying and growing its business over the last decade. Indeed  thanks to organic initiatives and inorganic acquisitions  the company exponentially increased its top-line sales since its Initial Public Offering in 2014. Revenue is three times higher now  and cash trading (Euronext variable revenue generation) as a percentage of the total company's sales declined to 18% compared to 36% in 2014. Despite that  the cash and post-trading activities result in lower revenue growth generation versus its direct competitors. And they are also volatile; this is one of the reasons why the company's structural growth is currently lower than other European stock exchanges (London Stock Exchange Group plc and Deutsche Börse - both covered by Mare Evidence Lab). However  despite forecasting another quarter of negative growth for Q2  we believe a few positive catalysts will likely drive a stock re-pricing. The Allfunds offer caused confusion  but we think it was a wake-up call for future M&A with less leverage with new targets with accretive EPS and ROIC above WACC. Even if no transactions happen in the short-medium time horizon  Euronext could deliver above shareholders' capital generation  increasing dividends while deleveraging. Here at the Lab  we won't be surprised by a buyback announcement.Mare Past AnalysisBefore moving on with our Q2 preview  there are relevant factors that go in line with our buy rating:Globally  in H1 2023  there were 615 IPOs with collections of $60.9 billion. According to EY  transaction numbers and capital raised declined by 5% and 36% on a yearly basis  respectively. On a quarterly basis  Q2 shows a gradual recovery. Restrictive monetary policies  market volatility  and other unfavorable conditions also characterized the second quarter. However  IPO in some emerging markets are increasing  with the technology sector that maintains leadership. A positive surprise was the Italian case. Italy goes against this negative trend  with growth in the number of IPOs (+25%) and capital raised collection  which achieved a plus 12%. Sixteen transactions were finalized in H1 with four listings on the main Euronext market (EuroGroup Laminations €393m  Lottomatica €600m  Italian Design Brands €70m  Ferretti Yacht: €265m) and allowed the company to become the tenth market in terms of capital raised in the period with an IPO cumulative market cap of over €1.5 billion. On a negative note  but already implied in our numbers  are the companies' delistings. This involved seven companies with a cumulative market capitalization of €1 billion. To sum up  in our numbers  we are pricing a positive delta of plus €500 million  which is negligible given the total market cap of companies on the Euronext stock exchange  which is circa €5.40 trillion. Despite that  it might be seen as a positive sign for Wall Street analyst's sentiment; In a previous publication released in Sept. 2022 called ""We Are Still Positive "" we detailed a positive framework from the EU legislators. In addition  we also emphasized how the Italian regulators were proactively working to streamline IPO admin costs and simplify IPO listing rules. Today  there is support from other countries to unify rule across the European region. There are tax haven countries within the area  such as Ireland  Luxembourg  and the Netherlands  where companies have better fiscal and bureaucratic conditions. The EU does not enjoy the financial uniqueness that NYSE and NASDAQ have. To safeguard Euronext  which the Italian and French Governments also own  the EU Antitrust President was clear that there would be rules to prevent differentiated treatment applied in other countries. This is key to Euronext re-rating given the fact that the EU is the world's wealthiest continent  where only 9.8% of the world's population resides but accounts for 50% of the total global wealth; Last month  Euronext signed an agreement to sell the 11.1% stake in LCH SA  a French clearing house  to the London Stock Exchange Group for a disclosed amount of €111 million. This transaction is expected to take place in early July. At an accounting level  in 2023 Q3  Euronext will record a capital gain of around €40 million pre-tax  given that LCH's book value was at €70.6 million at 2022 year-end. Again  this will help the company's deleveraging plan. This disposal increases our 2023 forecast EPS estimates by 2%.Looking ahead to Q2  we expect lower volumes given the negative currency effect on a weaker NOK and lower trading volumes. While trading revenues significantly decreased in Q1  signing a minus 15% on a yearly basis  we forecast a minus 6% in Q2. We are also lowering our estimates for Q3 and Q4 by 2%. This is supported by the latest data released on a monthly basis by Euronext.Euronext Latest Month VolumesSource: Euronext StatsConsidering a positive EPS implication on LCH stake disposal  our overall EPS impact signed a minus 3% in 2023. Our estimates  including the cash flow generation  arrived at a debt of €1.7 billion at year-end. Without additional M&A  our two-year forecast on financial debt  decreased to €835 million with net debt on adj. EBITDA at 1x. Currently  the company is inexpensive compared to history and closest peers (by approximately 40%). Thanks to the company's 2024 strategy  they forecast a 3-4% organic revenue growth generation with a 5-6% organic EBITDA in the period  thanks to Borsa Italiana consolidation. Here at the Lab  we believe that it offers an attractive valuation. Volume pressure will ease on a quarterly basis  and even valuing the company with a P/E of 15x (still applying a 25% discount vs. peers)  we derive a valuation of €85 per share. On average  the main competitors (DB1  LSEG  ICE  and Nasdaq) are trading at 19x. In addition  the Euronext FCF yield is at 8% and well covers the current dividend yield. This adds a margin of safety in evaluating buying additional company shares.Risks to our buy rating includes lower trading volumes  significant non-accretive acquisitions and potential integration problems  lower volatility & activities in financial markets  and regulatory changes.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.
