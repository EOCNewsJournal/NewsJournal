Leading DeFi protocols are adopting CCIP to power cross-chain smart contracts   including Synthetix  which is live on CCIP mainnet  as well as Aave  with BGD Labs now integrating CCIP on mainnet into the protocol. On July 20  CCIP will become available to all developers across five testnets: Arbitrum Goerli  Avalanche Fuji  Ethereum Sepolia  Optimism Goerli  and Polygon Mumbai.The Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) has entered early access with Aave (BGD Labs) and SynthetixCCIP is the most secure  reliable  and easy-to-use interoperability protocol for building cross-chain applications and services. Not only are developers given the flexibility to build their own cross-chain solutions on top of CCIP using Arbitrary Messaging  but CCIP also provides Simplified Token Transfers—which enables protocols to quickly start transferring tokens across chains using audited token pool contracts they control without writing custom code and in a fraction of the time it would take to build on their own.""DeFi has faced billions of dollars in cross-chain hacks  with developers often having to patch together bridges to build dApps that interact across different blockchains. Chainlink CCIP finally gives developers one platform for building applications that securely operate across any blockchain. Backed by the Chainlink Network's time-tested infrastructure and novel security approaches  which have enabled over $8 Trillion in Transaction Value  CCIP is a cross-chain solution that banking and DeFi builders both need to 10x the on-chain economy in their respective verticals '' stated Sergey Nazarov  Co-Founder of Chainlink.Synthetix is a DeFi protocol that acts as a liquidity layer for an ecosystem of on-chain derivatives and financial instruments. One of its recent additions  the Synth Teleporter  provides users with a streamlined method for transferring Synth liquidity between chains. This feature operates by burning sUSD (the protocol's unit of account) on the source chain  then minting an equivalent amount of sUSD on the destination chain.The Synth Teleporter employs Chainlink CCIP to burn and mint tokens across chains safely and accurately  ensuring security and reliability. This unique burn-and-mint model promotes higher capital efficiency without the need for liquidity pools. In doing so  Synth Teleporters enable Synthetix liquidity to flow toward areas with the highest demand  bypassing constraints associated with traditional token bridges.""Security is critical when dealing with on-chain assets  which is why we leverage Chainlink CCIP for our cross-chain Synths Teleporter. As one of the first users of Chainlink Data Feeds  we're thrilled to get first access to CCIP and all the functionality it unlocks for Synthetix "" stated Kain Warwick  Founder of Synthetix.Aave is a lending protocol that allows users to borrow and lend assets on-chain. BGD Labs   a Web3 development initiative  is integrating Chainlink CCIP into the Aave Protocol to future-proof its cross-chain governance system. The continued integration of more chains into CCIP will give AAVE the ability to easily launch itself onto more chains and to conduct key operations like governance through a highly secure solution.""We're excited to leverage Chainlink CCIP for secure  reliable  and scalable cross-chain communication on the next iteration of the Aave protocol. With seamless integration into the cross-chain governance mechanism  CCIP is set to save valuable developer time that can be better spent enhancing the core features of Aave "" stated Ernesto Boado  Co-Founder of BGD Labs.In addition to CCIP's adoption by the world's leading DeFi applications  Swift and over a dozen financial institutions and financial market infrastructure providers have already begun working with CCIP for both messages and token transfers across public and private chains. The initial group participating in the CCIP collaboration is made up of the world's largest market infrastructures  global banks and largest custodians by AUM  including The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC)  Euroclear  Citi  BNY Mellon  BNP Paribas  Lloyds Banking Group  Clearstream  SIX Digital Exchange (SDX)  and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ). This collaboration aims to both send value between banks and from banks onto public blockchains  effectively laying the groundwork for connecting the global financial system to on-chain financial products (such as AAVE and Synthetix) with a globally accepted interoperability standard.""CCIP is solving both sides of the connectivity puzzle by connecting the world's leading DeFi dApps to any chain and then connecting the world's leading global banks to any chain. CCIP will be the only connectivity standard that allows value to flow between multi-trillion dollar traditional capital markets systems and the rapidly growing Web3 application ecosystem. Our goal with CCIP is not only to create connectivity within these two critical groups  but to create a way for them to securely and efficiently transact with each other. If we're successful  I believe that the blockchain industry could see tens of trillions of dollars in market value added to it  via the sending of value from banks into public blockchains "" stated Sergey Nazarov.Learn more about the Chainlink CCIP Mainnet Early Access launch: https://blog.chain.link/ccip-mainnet-early-access/About ChainlinkChainlink is the industry-standard Web3 services platform.

Leading DeFi protocols are adopting CCIP to power cross-chain smart contracts   including Synthetix  which is live on CCIP mainnet  as well as Aave  with BGD Labs now integrating CCIP on mainnet into the protocol. On July 20  CCIP will become available to all developers across five testnets: Arbitrum Goerli  Avalanche Fuji  Ethereum Sepolia  Optimism Goerli  and Polygon Mumbai.The Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) has entered early access with Aave (BGD Labs) and SynthetixCCIP is the most secure  reliable  and easy-to-use interoperability protocol for building cross-chain applications and services. Not only are developers given the flexibility to build their own cross-chain solutions on top of CCIP using Arbitrary Messaging  but CCIP also provides Simplified Token Transfers—which enables protocols to quickly start transferring tokens across chains using audited token pool contracts they control without writing custom code and in a fraction of the time it would take to build on their own.""DeFi has faced billions of dollars in cross-chain hacks  with developers often having to patch together bridges to build dApps that interact across different blockchains. Chainlink CCIP finally gives developers one platform for building applications that securely operate across any blockchain. Backed by the Chainlink Network's time-tested infrastructure and novel security approaches  which have enabled over $8 Trillion in Transaction Value  CCIP is a cross-chain solution that banking and DeFi builders both need to 10x the on-chain economy in their respective verticals '' stated Sergey Nazarov  Co-Founder of Chainlink.Synthetix is a DeFi protocol that acts as a liquidity layer for an ecosystem of on-chain derivatives and financial instruments. One of its recent additions  the Synth Teleporter  provides users with a streamlined method for transferring Synth liquidity between chains. This feature operates by burning sUSD (the protocol's unit of account) on the source chain  then minting an equivalent amount of sUSD on the destination chain.The Synth Teleporter employs Chainlink CCIP to burn and mint tokens across chains safely and accurately  ensuring security and reliability. This unique burn-and-mint model promotes higher capital efficiency without the need for liquidity pools. In doing so  Synth Teleporters enable Synthetix liquidity to flow toward areas with the highest demand  bypassing constraints associated with traditional token bridges.""Security is critical when dealing with on-chain assets  which is why we leverage Chainlink CCIP for our cross-chain Synths Teleporter. As one of the first users of Chainlink Data Feeds  we're thrilled to get first access to CCIP and all the functionality it unlocks for Synthetix "" stated Kain Warwick  Founder of Synthetix.Aave is a lending protocol that allows users to borrow and lend assets on-chain. BGD Labs   a Web3 development initiative  is integrating Chainlink CCIP into the Aave Protocol to future-proof its cross-chain governance system. The continued integration of more chains into CCIP will give AAVE the ability to easily launch itself onto more chains and to conduct key operations like governance through a highly secure solution.""We're excited to leverage Chainlink CCIP for secure  reliable  and scalable cross-chain communication on the next iteration of the Aave protocol. With seamless integration into the cross-chain governance mechanism  CCIP is set to save valuable developer time that can be better spent enhancing the core features of Aave "" stated Ernesto Boado  Co-Founder of BGD Labs.In addition to CCIP's adoption by the world's leading DeFi applications  Swift and over a dozen financial institutions and financial market infrastructure providers have already begun working with CCIP for both messages and token transfers across public and private chains. The initial group participating in the CCIP collaboration is made up of the world's largest market infrastructures  global banks and largest custodians by AUM  including The Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (DTCC)  Euroclear  Citi  BNY Mellon  BNP Paribas  Lloyds Banking Group  Clearstream  SIX Digital Exchange (SDX)  and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ). This collaboration aims to both send value between banks and from banks onto public blockchains  effectively laying the groundwork for connecting the global financial system to on-chain financial products (such as AAVE and Synthetix) with a globally accepted interoperability standard.""CCIP is solving both sides of the connectivity puzzle by connecting the world's leading DeFi dApps to any chain and then connecting the world's leading global banks to any chain. CCIP will be the only connectivity standard that allows value to flow between multi-trillion dollar traditional capital markets systems and the rapidly growing Web3 application ecosystem. Our goal with CCIP is not only to create connectivity within these two critical groups  but to create a way for them to securely and efficiently transact with each other. If we're successful  I believe that the blockchain industry could see tens of trillions of dollars in market value added to it  via the sending of value from banks into public blockchains "" stated Sergey Nazarov.Learn more about the Chainlink CCIP Mainnet Early Access launch: https://blog.chain.link/ccip-mainnet-early-access/About ChainlinkChainlink is the industry-standard Web3 services platform.

As a reminder  at constant rates and scope  our initial forecast for revenue growth was within a range of between 4% and 6% while our initial forecast for ratio of Adjusted EBIT1 was within a range of between 13% and 14%. We now expect revenue growth at constant rates and scope within a range of between 0% and 4%. The ratio of Adjusted EBIT1 should now consolidate within a range of between 12% and 13% at constant exchange rates.On the one hand  we confirm the overall market growth slowdown observed during the first quarter  with decreasing volumes in many geographies while compared to 2022. On the other hand  we are facing production capacity’s limitations for dog and cat vaccines  temporary however larger than expected throughout this first semester. This situation weighs on our fixed costs’ absorption as well as on our sales  given our low level of vaccine stocks. In addition to that  there is also the impact linked to the cyberattack of which we were victims on June 19  though we are not yet able to precisely measure all its consequences. Our teams remain fully mobilized to ensure business continuity and implement remediation plans with deployments currently executed with efficiency and speed.All of these elements prevent us from envisaging a catch-up by the end of the year  hence leading us today to adjust our sales forecasts for the year 2023 and subsequently our forecasts of Adjusted EBIT.

As a reminder ...,English FrenchSeveral elements are currently impacting our business and leading us today to revise our forecasts for the 2023 financial year. As a reminder  at constant rates and scope  our initial forecast for revenue growth was within a range of between 4% and 6% while our initial forecast for ratio of Adjusted EBIT1 was within a range of between 13% and 14%. We now expect revenue growth at constant rates and scope within a range of between 0% and 4%. The ratio of Adjusted EBIT1 should now consolidate within a range of between 12% and 13% at constant exchange rates.On the one hand  we confirm the overall market growth slowdown observed during the first quarter  with decreasing volumes in many geographies while compared to 2022. On the other hand  we are facing production capacity’s limitations for dog and cat vaccines  temporary however larger than expected throughout this first semester. This situation weighs on our fixed costs’ absorption as well as on our sales  given our low level of vaccine stocks. In addition to that  there is also the impact linked to the cyberattack of which we were victims on June 19  though we are not yet able to precisely measure all its consequences. Our teams remain fully mobilized to ensure business continuity and implement remediation plans with deployments currently executed with efficiency and speed.All of these elements prevent us from envisaging a catch-up by the end of the year  hence leading us today to adjust our sales forecasts for the year 2023 and subsequently our forecasts of Adjusted EBIT. The momentum of our activity remains positive in many geographies and we also remain confident about the group's 2030 forecasts that remain unchanged.1 “current operating profit before amortization of assets resulting from acquisitions” to “revenue” ratioA lifelong commitment to animal healthAt Virbac  we provide innovative solutions to veterinarians  farmers and animal owners in more than 100 countries around the world.

This civilian player is strengthening its operational capabilities to meet the growing number of current and future offshore projects  such as offshore wind farms. The sale also demonstrates the synergies between Exail's activities  since this first-rate customer already uses the Group's navigation and positioning systems. This first DriX order could be followed by a second for the same client.This is the third DriX order in 2023  for a total of almost €6 million  not counting smaller preliminary demonstration orders  such as the one for the US Navy which took place in Bahrain in the first quarter 2023. These various commercial successes demonstrate the strong commercial momentum of the DriX  which is making inroads into the hydrography market thanks to its high reliability  10-day autonomy and very low carbon footprint  around 100 times smaller than that of a hydrography vessel.To strengthen its presence in the United States  Exail has also formed a partnership with the University of New Hampshire (UNH)  recognized as an international leader in ocean mapping. On July 15  Exail and UNH announced at a dedicated event the creation of a new innovation hub near Boston. This hub will engage in all aspects of marine autonomous operations  including surface vehicles for exploration and ocean mapping  to help meet the challenges of the growing blue economy.In particular  the new hub will work with one of the world's most advanced centers for coastal and ocean mapping  the CCOM[1]  managed by UNH and NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration)  which already operates DriX drones for various types of mission.The new facility  which will be able to house a DriX remote control center  maintenance operations and training courses  is an important lever for increasing Exail's autonomous drone deliveries to U.S. civil and defense customers.About Exail TechnologiesExail Technologies is the new name of Groupe Gorgé  adopted after the transformation of the group at the end of 2022  now focused on the activities of its subsidiary Exail.

H1 2022 % rev. Ch. Ch. (%) TOTAL REVENUE 8 394 8 145 249 +3% Licences 3 777 45% 4 197 52% -420 -10% Maintenance 2 392 28% 2 081 26% +311 +15% Services 2 225 27% 1 867 23% +358 +19% Third-party sales - - - - - - “Platforms” business 5 568 66% 5 372 66% +196 +4% “Legacy” business 2 826 34% 2 773 34% +53 +2%(*) H1 2023 revenue is currently being audited._ GROWTH IN “PLATFORM” REVENUE AND CONTINUATION OF STRUCTURAL PROJECTSThe new team on mission and team on the run critical business and communications platforms  for which revenue rose by 4% to €5.6 million in the first half of 2023  still represent the Group's main revenue source (66%) and will be major growth drivers over the coming years.As previously announced  the mass roll-out of the PCSTORM project is currently underway  with the forthcoming deployment of the largest MCPTT platform in the world in terms of simultaneous end users.The type of revenue related to the project will therefore change as the project progresses  moving from licence revenue (€2.4 million in 2021 and €3 million in 2022) to revenue from maintenance and services (new operational condition maintenance contract from mid-2022). The changes in licence revenue (down €0.4 million) and maintenance revenue (up €0.3 million) recorded at 30 June 2023 are therefore mainly due to this change to the PCSTORM contract. The growth in recurring revenue from maintenance will be confirmed in the coming months.Regarding the breakdown of the €5.6 million in revenue from the “platforms” business at 30 June 2023  revenue from licences (€2.9 million) fell by €0.6 million  following the base effects referred to above  while recurring revenue from maintenance (€0.7 million) and services (€2 million) increased by €0.4 million each. Business therefore grew by €0. 2 million in the first half of 2023  with new projects being rolled out  particularly in France  in the transport and energy sectors.The legacy telecom operator solutions business grew slightly by 2% in H1 2023 (up €0.1 million) and accounted for 34% of first-half revenue (€2.8 million). Licence sales  which are intrinsically non-recurring  rose in the first half of 2023 (up €0.3 million) to €1 million at 30 June 2023  mainly as a result of one new project in the United States and two platforms upgrade projects for French operators. Legacy maintenance flows fell slightly (by €0.1 million) following the discontinuation of increased support for one French customer  to €1.7 million at 30 June 2023. Legacy services (€0.1 million) remained insignificant in the first half of 2023 (€0.2 million)._ OUTLOOK: PROVEN TECHNOLOGY AND DIVERSIFICATION OF REVENUE SOURCESAs announced in the 2022 earnings release published in March  the level of 2023 revenue currently anticipated is satisfactory  but remains closely correlated with the final calendar of official notices and the operational deployment of French and European ministerial projects.In the short term  the Group is still awaiting official notice regarding the Italian project  which the Group won several months ago. The impact on revenue could be more or less significant from the second half of the year  depending on the date and value of the first order issued and received. Other projects could also come to fruition in the second half of 2023  notably in France (“platforms” business  team on the run and legacy)  but also in Europe (“platforms” business  team on mission) and the United States (legacy).Over the medium term  public safety projects and projects for the armed forces  and the widespread adoption of new-generation communications solutions are expected to accelerate.The Group's direct or indirect involvement in virtually all ongoing critical communications projects (in Southern Europe  Central Europe  the UK and the Middle East) underlines the quality and technological edge offered by its solution (team on mission). The platform technology developed by the Group has become a must for most major players in the sector. The Group has the human and financial resources to maintain and further increase the technological lead of its solutions and to support changes in the MCx market in order to capitalise on its certain future growth.With regard to the team on the run solution  the Group's continuous developments in recent years  which have been integrated into secure and scalable sovereign technical architectures  offer distinct advantages over current rival solutions. The new modules added recently (Field Service Management - FSM - and Geofencing  i.e. virtual physical barriers and the associated alert system) further enhance an already functionally rich solution. Over the coming months  the Group should be able to respond effectively to the needs of major players  enabling them to free themselves from current technical and organisational constraints. These various projects  based on specific but strategic use cases  could represent a significant new source of revenue for the Group.First-half trends are therefore expected to continue during the second half. Major projects are set to be approved in the coming months in all Group business lines (platforms and legacy). While variables such as time and the speed at which new communications and mission-critical technologies are adopted and become widespread remain unknown factors  the Group remains confident in the technological lead demonstrated by its various solutions  and in its ability to maintain the profitable growth momentum it has demonstrated and sustained over several years.Next financial release: H1 2023 earnings  Monday 18 September 2023_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________About STREAMWIDE (Euronext Growth: ALSTW)A major player for 20 years in the critical communications market  STREAMWIDE has successfully developed its Team on mission (mission critical) and Team on the run (business critical) software solutions for administrations and businesses.

Currently  only 10% to 20% of patients are diagnosed at a stage where the tumour is resectable.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays an increasingly important role in the early diagnosis of prostate cancer. The European Association of Urology recommends MRI before considering a biopsy. However  prostate MRI is difficult to interpret and requires a good level of expertise to avoid the high variability of interpretations and diagnostic errors highlighted in some studies.3However  thanks to advances in artificial intelligence  it is possible to develop a machine learning system that uses supervised learning algorithms trained using large volumes of medical data from patients with suspected prostate cancer. By training artificial intelligence on these data  it becomes possible to create a model capable of detecting the early signs of prostate cancer.The PI-CAI Grand Challenge  a competition to advance the diagnosis of prostate cancerThe PI-CAI Grand Challenge  launched in November 2022 on the detection of prostate cancer  aims to encourage technological advances in early diagnosis and accurate detection of prostate cancer and to evaluate the performance of participants' artificial intelligence algorithms.Bringing together more than 320 academic and industrial teams  including Guerbet  each invited to submit an artificial intelligence algorithm capable of diagnosing more than 10 000 prostate MRI examinations in order to be compared to diagnoses of radiologists specialised in prostate imaging.The PI-CAI Grand Challenge was divided into two stages. During the first stage  the organisation proposed that the participating teams train their algorithm on approximately 1 500 data  which was then tested by the organisers on a cohort of internal data from 1 000 patients. It was at the Annual Meeting of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) 2022 in Chicago that the Guerbet team was recognised  ranking first and second according to performance metricsFor the second stage of the challenge  the organisers proposed that the 5 finalists from the first stage train their algorithm on a much wider database of 9 100 MRIs in order to evaluate their performance. Guerbet once again responded magnificently to the challenge  ranking first in all categories  according to the results revealed on 10 July at the Medical Imaging with Deep Learning (MIDL) conference in Nashville in the United States.At the same time as this artificial intelligence challenge  the organisation conducted a multi-centre  multi-reader study on the same database with the next objective being to compare radiologists' results to those of algorithms. This second part of the study will be published next.""This recognition demonstrates our commitment to innovation and research to improve the diagnosis and care of cancer patients. We will continue to invest in advanced technology solutions to fight this disease  collaborate with healthcare professionals to further improve our technology and accessibility. An initial AI prostate cancer algorithm marketing pathway will be created within the framework of the non-exclusive licensing agreement signed with Intrasense in the first half of 2024: an agreement that provides for the marketing of a product incorporating the Guerbet prostate algorithm during the first quarter of 2024 "" says François Nicolas  Senior Vice President  Research  Development and Innovation  and Chief Digital Officer at Guerbet.About GuerbetAt Guerbet  we build lasting relationships so that we enable people to live better. That is our purpose. We are a world leader in medical imaging  offering a complete range of pharmaceutical products  medical devices and digital and AI solutions for diagnostic and interventional imaging.

Currently  only 10% to 20% of patients are diagnosed at a stage where the tumour is resectable.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays an increasingly important role in the early diagnosis of prostate cancer. The European Association of Urology recommends MRI before considering a biopsy. However  prostate MRI is difficult to interpret and requires a good level of expertise to avoid the high variability of interpretations and diagnostic errors highlighted in some studies.3However  thanks to advances in artificial intelligence  it is possible to develop a machine learning system that uses supervised learning algorithms trained using large volumes of medical data from patients with suspected prostate cancer. By training artificial intelligence on these data  it becomes possible to create a model capable of detecting the early signs of prostate cancer.The PI-CAI Grand Challenge  a competition to advance the diagnosis of prostate cancerThe PI-CAI Grand Challenge  launched in November 2022 on the detection of prostate cancer  aims to encourage technological advances in early diagnosis and accurate detection of prostate cancer and to evaluate the performance of participants' artificial intelligence algorithms.Bringing together more than 320 academic and industrial teams  including Guerbet  each invited to submit an artificial intelligence algorithm capable of diagnosing more than 10 000 prostate MRI examinations in order to be compared to diagnoses of radiologists specialised in prostate imaging.The PI-CAI Grand Challenge was divided into two stages. During the first stage  the organisation proposed that the participating teams train their algorithm on approximately 1 500 data  which was then tested by the organisers on a cohort of internal data from 1 000 patients. It was at the Annual Meeting of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) 2022 in Chicago that the Guerbet team was recognised  ranking first and second according to performance metricsFor the second stage of the challenge  the organisers proposed that the 5 finalists from the first stage train their algorithm on a much wider database of 9 100 MRIs in order to evaluate their performance. Guerbet once again responded magnificently to the challenge  ranking first in all categories  according to the results revealed on 10 July at the Medical Imaging with Deep Learning (MIDL) conference in Nashville in the United States.At the same time as this artificial intelligence challenge  the organisation conducted a multi-centre  multi-reader study on the same database with the next objective being to compare radiologists' results to those of algorithms. This second part of the study will be published next.""This recognition demonstrates our commitment to innovation and research to improve the diagnosis and care of cancer patients. We will continue to invest in advanced technology solutions to fight this disease  collaborate with healthcare professionals to further improve our technology and accessibility. An initial AI prostate cancer algorithm marketing pathway will be created within the framework of the non-exclusive licensing agreement signed with Intrasense in the first half of 2024: an agreement that provides for the marketing of a product incorporating the Guerbet prostate algorithm during the first quarter of 2024 "" says François Nicolas  Senior Vice President  Research  Development and Innovation  and Chief Digital Officer at Guerbet.About GuerbetAt Guerbet  we build lasting relationships so that we enable people to live better.

Aramis Group has focused on adapting the mix of vehicles offered to its customers  with a selection of cars that are less expensive and better aligned with their expectations. Particular attention has also been paid to arbitration between the different sourcing channels  to capture purchasing opportunities at the best price in a rebalancing market. Lastly  the Group’s best practices are being rolled out at the most recent refurbishing centers  while the most mature ones are benefiting from continuous improvement initiatives.

For the 2022 scope  i.e. excluding the acquisitions in Austria and Italy  B2C segment revenues show a slight contraction.Revenues for the refurbished cars segment totaled €349.7 million  up +6.7% compared with the third quarter of 2022 on a reported basis. During the quarter  19 361 vehicles were delivered  achieving +5.5% growth compared with the same period in 2022.For the 2022 scope  revenues linked to refurbished vehicles are down -5.1% to €311.0 million  with contrasting performances by country  resulting from both the underlying trends on the various markets and the operational decisions taken locally by Aramis Group.The number of refurbished vehicles sold was down -6.6% for the third quarter of 2023 compared with the same period in 2022. France and the UK performed on average in line with their local market for used vehicles less than eight years old  Aramis Group’s core target. In Spain  following six years of exponential growth  the Villaverde refurbishing center has been adapting its production methods over the past few months to changes in the types of vehicles to be refurbished  impacting its production levels and therefore its sales. Alongside this  Aramis Group is actively working on the geographical expansion of its operations in the country.Revenues for the pre-registered cars segment came to €61.6 million  up a strong +33.7% from the third quarter of 2022. As a reminder  only Aramis Group’s French and Belgian subsidiaries sell pre-registered vehicles. 3 726 units were sold over the period  up +66.9% compared with the third quarter of 2022. The performance achieved in France was exceptional  with a +92% increase in volumes thanks to the experience and the major network of suppliers built up by Aramis Group across Europe over the last 22 years. Compared with the second quarter of 2023  the total volumes of pre-registered vehicles sold are up +23.7%  once again confirming this market’s reacceleration.B2B – sales of cars to professional customers (11% of revenues)Revenues for the B2B segment came to €52.1 million for the third quarter of 2023  down -14.7% compared with the third quarter of 2022. For reference  this activity’s development reflects the automotive market pricing trends and the proportion of vehicles sourced from private owners  some of which are resold to professionals (mainly vehicles over eight years old or 150 000 km). Given the rebalancing of Aramis Group’s sourcing towards more vehicles from professional channels (48% of the refurbished vehicles sold in the third quarter of 2023)  B2B revenues are logically down.Services (5% of revenues)Services generated €25.6 million of revenues during the third quarter of 2023  up +10.0% compared with the third quarter of 2022. The penetration rate for financing solutions contracted slightly to 45% on average over the period.Governance rotationSince Aramis Group was founded in 2001  Guillaume Paoli and Nicolas Chartier have alternated positions to serve as its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and its Deputy Chief Executive Officer  based on a two-year rotation. The Board of Directors on June 7  2023  approved the rotation of their positions. Since June 8  2023  and for the next two years  Guillaume Paoli will now be Aramis Group’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  with Nicolas Chartier serving as its Deputy Chief Executive Officer.

For the 2022 scope  i.e. excluding the acquisitions in Austria and Italy  B2C segment revenues show a slight contraction.Revenues for therefurbished cars segment totaled €349.7 million  up +6.7% compared with the third quarter of 2022 on a reported basis. During the quarter  19 361 vehicles were delivered  achieving +5.5% growth compared with the same period in 2022.For the 2022 scope  revenues linked to refurbished vehicles are down -5.1% to €311.0 million  with contrasting performances by country  resulting from both the underlying trends on the various markets and the operational decisions taken locally by Aramis Group.The number of refurbished vehicles sold was down -6.6% for the third quarter of 2023 compared with the same period in 2022. France and the UK performed on average in line with their local market for used vehicles less than eight years old  Aramis Group’s core target. In Spain  following six years of exponential growth  the Villaverde refurbishing center has been adapting its production methods over the past few months to changes in the types of vehicles to be refurbished  impacting its production levels and therefore its sales. Alongside this  Aramis Group is actively working on the geographical expansion of its operations in the country.Revenues for thepre-registered cars segment came to €61.6 million  up a strong +33.7% from the third quarter of 2022. As a reminder  only Aramis Group’s French and Belgian subsidiaries sell pre-registered vehicles. 3 726 units were sold over the period  up +66.9% compared with the third quarter of 2022. The performance achieved in France was exceptional  with a +92% increase in volumes thanks to the experience and the major network of suppliers built up by Aramis Group across Europe over the last 22 years. Compared with the second quarter of 2023  the total volumes of pre-registered vehicles sold are up +23.7%  once again confirming this market’s reacceleration.B2B – sales of cars to professional customers (11% of revenues)Revenues for the B2B segment came to €52.1 million for the third quarter of 2023  down -14.7% compared with the third quarter of 2022. For reference  this activity’s development reflects the automotive market pricing trends and the proportion of vehicles sourced from private owners  some of which are resold to professionals (mainly vehicles over eight years old or 150 000 km). Given the rebalancing of Aramis Group’s sourcing towards more vehicles from professional channels (48% of the refurbished vehicles sold in the third quarter of 2023)  B2B revenues are logically down.Services (5% of revenues)Services generated €25.6 million of revenues during the third quarter of 2023  up +10.0% compared with the third quarter of 2022. The penetration rate for financing solutions contracted slightly to 45% on average over the period.Governance rotationSince Aramis Group was founded in 2001  Guillaume Paoli and Nicolas Chartier have alternated positions to serve as its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and its Deputy Chief Executive Officer  based on a two-year rotation. The Board of Directors on June 7  2023  approved the rotation of their positions. Since June 8  2023  and for the next two years  Guillaume Paoli will now be Aramis Group’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  with Nicolas Chartier serving as its Deputy Chief Executive Officer.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Sanofi and AstraZeneca’s Beyfortus™ (nirsevimab-alip) for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) in newborns and infants born during or entering their first RSV season  and for children up to 24 months of age who remain vulnerable to severe RSV disease through their second RSV season. The companies plan to make Beyfortus available in the U.S. ahead of the upcoming 2023-2024 RSV season.RSV is the leading cause of hospitalization for infants under the age of one in the U.S.  averaging 16 times higher than the annual rate for influenza.1 2 Each year  an estimated 590 000 RSV disease cases in infants under one require medical care  including physician office  urgent care  emergency room visits and hospitalizations.3ThomasTriompheExecutive Vice President  Vaccines  Sanofi“Today’s approval marks an unprecedented moment for protecting infant health in the U.S.  following an RSV season that took a record toll on infants  their families  and the U.S. healthcaresystem.Beyfortusistheonly monoclonal antibodyapprovedforpassive immunizationtoprovidesafeand effective protection for all infantsduring their first RSV season. I am proud that  by prioritizing this potential game-changer  we are now about to bring Beyfortus to American families.”IskraReicExecutive Vice President  Vaccines and Immune Therapies  AstraZeneca“Beyfortusrepresentsanopportunityforaparadigm-shiftinpreventingseriousrespiratorydisease due to RSV across a broad infant population in the U.S.The science that Beyfortus is built on demonstrates AstraZeneca’s continued leadership in addressing the needs of the most vulnerable populations and reducing the burden on healthcare systems.”The FDA decision follows the positive recommendation of the FDA Antimicrobial Drugs Advisory Committee and was based on the extensive Beyfortus clinical development program spanning three pivotal late-stage clinical trials. Across all clinical endpoints  a single dose of Beyfortus demonstrated high and consistent efficacy against RSV LRTD extending through five months  a typical RSV season.Beyfortus was well tolerated with a favorable safety profile that was consistent across all clinical trials. The overall rates of adverse events were comparable between Beyfortus and placebo and the majority of adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. The most common adverse events were rash and injection site reactions.The single administration of Beyfortus was developed to correspond with the beginning of the RSV season for babies born prior to the season or at birth for those born during the RSV season. In clinical trials  Beyfortus helped prevent RSV LRTD requiring medical care in all infant populations studied  including those born healthy at term  late preterm or preterm  or with specific health conditions that make them vulnerable to severe RSV disease. RSV diseaserequiring medical care included physician office  urgent care  emergency room visits and hospitalizations.Beyfortus  jointly developed by Sanofi and AstraZeneca  was approved in the European Union in October 2022  in Great Britain in November 2022  and recently received approval in Canada in April 2023. Regulatory applications are also currently under review in China  Japan and several other countries.AboutRSVRSV is a very contagious virus that can lead to serious respiratory illness for infants  according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). RSV symptoms can include runny nose  coughing  sneezing  fever  decrease in appetite  and wheezing.4 Two out of three infants are infected with RSV during their first year of life and almost all children are infected by their second birthday.4 5 In the U.S.  RSV is the leading cause of hospitalization in infants under 12 months  averaging 16 times higher than the annual rate for influenza.1 2 Approximately 75% of infants hospitalized for RSV are born healthy and at term with no underlying conditions.6 Each year in the U.S.  an estimated 590 000 RSV disease cases in infants under one require medical care  including physician office  urgent care  emergency room visits and hospitalizations.3AboutBeyfortusIn the U.S.  Beyfortus is a single-dose long-acting antibody designed to help prevent RSV lower respiratory tract disease in all infants through their first RSV season. Beyfortus is also indicated for children up to 24 months of age who remain vulnerable to severe RSV disease through their second RSV season.Beyfortus  provided directly to newborns and infants as a single dose  offers rapid protection via an antibody to help prevent LRTD caused by RSV  without requiring activation of the immune system.7 Beyfortus administration can be timed to the start of the RSV season.In March 2017   Sanofi and AstraZeneca announced an agreement to develop and commercialize Beyfortus. Under the terms of the agreement  AstraZeneca leads development and manufacturing activities and Sanofi leads commercialization activities and records revenues. Under the terms of the global agreement  Sanofi made an upfront payment of€120m  has paid development and regulatory milestones of €55m and will pay up to a further€440m upon achievement of certain regulatory and sales-related milestones. The two companies share costs and profits in all territories except in the U.S. where Sanofi consolidates 100% of the economic benefits in its Business Operating Income.Beyfortus has been granted special designations to facilitate expedited development by several regulatory agencies around the world. These include Breakthrough Therapy Designation and Priority Review designation by The China Center for Drug Evaluation under the National Medical Products Administration; Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration; access granted to the European Medicines Agency(EMA) PRIority MEdicines (PRIME) scheme and EMA accelerated assessment; Promising Innovative Medicine designation by the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency; and has been named “a medicine for prioritized development” under the Project for Drug Selection to Promote New Drug Development in Pediatrics by the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development.Beyfortus has been granted marketing authorization in the European Union  Great Britain and Canada for the prevention of RSV lower respiratory tract disease in newborns and infants from birth through their first RSV season and is currently undergoing regulatory review in China  Japan and several other countries. In Canada  nirsevimab is also approved for children up to 24 months of age who remain vulnerable to severe RSV disease through their second RSV season and such indication is under review at the EMA level.AbouttheclinicaltrialsThe Phase 2b trial (Trial 03) was a randomized  placebo-controlled trial designed to measure the efficacy of Beyfortus against medically attended lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) caused by RSV through 150 days post-dose in healthy preterm infants of 29 to less than 35 weeks’ gestation (n=1 453). Infants were randomized (2:1) to receive a single 50 mg intramuscular injection of Beyfortus (n=969) or placebo (n=484) regardless of weight at the RSV season start. The primary endpoint was met  significantly reducing the incidence of medically attended RSV LRTD by 70.1% (95% CI: 52.3  81.2; P<0.001) compared to placebo. In a prespecified secondary endpoint  Beyfortus reduced medically attended RSV LRTD with hospitalization by 78.4% (95% CI 51.9  90.3) versus placebo.The Beyfortus dosing regimen was determined based on further exploration of the Phase 2b data and was used in subsequent trials as a single 50 mg dose for those who weigh less than 5 kg  or a single 100 mg dose for those who weigh 5 kg or greater. A post-hoc analysis of the Phase 2b study that applied the recommended 50 mg dose in a subgroup of infants weighing less than 5 kg showed the efficacy of Beyfortus against medically attended RSV LRTD and medically attended RSV LRTD with hospitalization was 86.2% (95% CI 68.0  94.0) and 86.5%(95% CI 53.5  96.1)  respectively.The Phase 3 MELODY trial (Trial 04) was a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial conducted across 21 countries designed to determine the safety and efficacy of Beyfortus against medically attended LRTD caused by RSV in healthy term and late preterm infants (35 weeks gestational age or greater) entering their first RSV season  including efficacy against severe disease such as hospitalization  through 150 days after dosing. The primary endpoint was met  reducing the incidence of medically attended RSV LRTD by 74.9% (95% CI 50.6  87.3; P<0.001) compared to placebo. The efficacy of Beyfortus against the secondary endpoint of hospitalization was 60.2% (95% CI: -14.6  86.2).MEDLEY (Trial 05) was a Phase 2/3  randomized  double-blind  palivizumab-controlled trial with the primary objective of assessing safety and tolerability for Beyfortus in preterm infants of less than 35 weeks’ gestational age and infants with congenital heart disease (CHD) and/or chronic lung disease (CLD) of prematurity eligible to receive palivizumab. Between July 2019 and May 2021  a total of 925 infants at higher risk for severe RSV disease entering their first RSV season were randomized to receive Beyfortus or palivizumab. Safety was assessed by monitoring the occurrence of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and treatment emergent severe adverse events (TESAEs) through 360 days post-dose. Serum levels of Beyfortus following dosing (on day 151) in this trial were comparable with those observed in the Phase 3 MELODY trial (Trial 04)  indicating similar protection in this population to that in healthy term and late preterm infants is likely.The safety profile of Beyfortus was similar to palivizumab in the MEDLEY Phase 2/3 trial and consistent with the safety profile in healthy term  late preterm and preterm infants compared to placebo across the MELODY and Phase 2b trials. While uncommon  the most reported adverse reactions were rash 14 days post-dose  (the majority of which were mild to moderate) and non-serious injection site reactions within 7 days post-dose.The results of MELODY  Phase 2/3 MEDLEY and the Phase 2b trials illustrate that Beyfortus helps protect infants during their first RSV season against RSV disease with a single dose.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Sanofi and AstraZeneca’s Beyfortus™ (nirsevimab-alip) for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) in newborns and infants born during or entering their first RSV season  and for children up to 24 months of age who remain vulnerable to severe RSV disease through their second RSV season. The companies plan to make Beyfortus available in the U.S. ahead of the upcoming 2023-2024 RSV season.RSV is the leading cause of hospitalization for infants under the age of one in the U.S.  averaging 16 times higher than the annual rate for influenza.1 2 Each year  an estimated 590 000 RSV disease cases in infants under one require medical care  including physician office  urgent care  emergency room visits and hospitalizations.3Thomas TriompheExecutive Vice President  Vaccines  Sanofi“Today’s approval marks an unprecedented moment for protecting infant health in the U.S.  following an RSV season that took a record toll on infants  their families  and the U.S. healthcare system. Beyfortus is the only monoclonal antibody approved for passive immunization to provide safe and effective protection for all infants during their first RSV season. I am proud that  by prioritizing this potential game-changer  we are now about to bring Beyfortus to American families.”Iskra ReicExecutive Vice President  Vaccines and Immune Therapies  AstraZeneca“Beyfortus represents an opportunity for a paradigm-shift in preventing serious respiratory disease due to RSV across a broad infant population in the U.S. The science that Beyfortus is built on demonstrates AstraZeneca’s continued leadership in addressing the needs of the most vulnerable populations and reducing the burden on healthcare systems.”The FDA decision follows the positive recommendation of the FDA Antimicrobial Drugs Advisory Committee and was based on the extensive Beyfortus clinical development program spanning three pivotal late-stage clinical trials. Across all clinical endpoints  a single dose of Beyfortus demonstrated high and consistent efficacy against RSV LRTD extending through five months  a typical RSV season.Beyfortus was well tolerated with a favorable safety profile that was consistent across all clinical trials. The overall rates of adverse events were comparable between Beyfortus and placebo and the majority of adverse events were mild or moderate in severity. The most common adverse events were rash and injection site reactions.The single administration of Beyfortus was developed to correspond with the beginning of the RSV season for babies born prior to the season or at birth for those born during the RSV season. In clinical trials  Beyfortus helped prevent RSV LRTD requiring medical care in all infant populations studied  including those born healthy at term  late preterm or preterm  or with specific health conditions that make them vulnerable to severe RSV disease. RSV diseaserequiring medical care included physician office  urgent care  emergency room visits and hospitalizations.Beyfortus  jointly developed by Sanofi and AstraZeneca  was approved in the European Union in October 2022  in Great Britain in November 2022  and recently received approval in Canada in April 2023. Regulatory applications are also currently under review in China  Japan and several other countries.About RSVRSV is a very contagious virus that can lead to serious respiratory illness for infants  according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). RSV symptoms can include runny nose  coughing  sneezing  fever  decrease in appetite  and wheezing.4 Two out of three infants are infected with RSV during their first year of life and almost all children are infected by their second birthday.4 5 In the U.S.  RSV is the leading cause of hospitalization in infants under 12 months  averaging 16 times higher than the annual rate for influenza.1 2 Approximately 75% of infants hospitalized for RSV are born healthy and at term with no underlying conditions.6 Each year in the U.S.  an estimated 590 000 RSV disease cases in infants under one require medical care  including physician office  urgent care  emergency room visits and hospitalizations.3About BeyfortusIn the U.S.  Beyfortus is a single-dose long-acting antibody designed to help prevent RSV lower respiratory tract disease in all infants through their first RSV season. Beyfortus is also indicated for children up to 24 months of age who remain vulnerable to severe RSV disease through their second RSV season.Beyfortus  provided directly to newborns and infants as a single dose  offers rapid protection via an antibody to help prevent LRTD caused by RSV  without requiring activation of the immune system.7 Beyfortus administration can be timed to the start of the RSV season.In March 2017   Sanofi and AstraZeneca announced an agreement to develop and commercialize Beyfortus. Under the terms of the agreement  AstraZeneca leads development and manufacturing activities and Sanofi leads commercialization activities and records revenues. Under the terms of the global agreement  Sanofi made an upfront payment of€120m  has paid development and regulatory milestones of €55m and will pay up to a further€440m upon achievement of certain regulatory and sales-related milestones. The two companies share costs and profits in all territories except in the U.S. where Sanofi consolidates 100% of the economic benefits in its Business Operating Income.Beyfortus has been granted special designations to facilitate expedited development by several regulatory agencies around the world. These include Breakthrough Therapy Designation and Priority Review designation by The China Center for Drug Evaluation under the National Medical Products Administration; Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration; access granted to the European Medicines Agency(EMA) PRIority MEdicines (PRIME) scheme and EMA accelerated assessment; Promising Innovative Medicine designation by the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency; and has been named “a medicine for prioritized development” under the Project for Drug Selection to Promote New Drug Development in Pediatrics by the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development.Beyfortus has been granted marketing authorization in the European Union  Great Britain and Canada for the prevention of RSV lower respiratory tract disease in newborns and infants from birth through their first RSV season and is currently undergoing regulatory review in China  Japan and several other countries. In Canada  nirsevimab is also approved for children up to 24 months of age who remain vulnerable to severe RSV disease through their second RSV season and such indication is under review at the EMA level.About the clinical trialsThe Phase 2b trial (Trial 03) was a randomized  placebo-controlled trial designed to measure the efficacy of Beyfortus against medically attended lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) caused by RSV through 150 days post-dose in healthy preterm infants of 29 to less than 35 weeks’ gestation (n=1 453). Infants were randomized (2:1) to receive a single 50 mg intramuscular injection of Beyfortus (n=969) or placebo (n=484) regardless of weight at the RSV season start. The primary endpoint was met  significantly reducing the incidence of medically attended RSV LRTD by 70.1% (95% CI: 52.3  81.2; P<0.001) compared to placebo. In a prespecified secondary endpoint  Beyfortus reduced medically attended RSV LRTD with hospitalization by 78.4% (95% CI 51.9  90.3) versus placebo.The Beyfortus dosing regimen was determined based on further exploration of the Phase 2b data and was used in subsequent trials as a single 50 mg dose for those who weigh less than 5 kg  or a single 100 mg dose for those who weigh 5 kg or greater. A post-hoc analysis of the Phase 2b study that applied the recommended 50 mg dose in a subgroup of infants weighing less than 5 kg showed the efficacy of Beyfortus against medically attended RSV LRTD and medically attended RSV LRTD with hospitalization was 86.2% (95% CI 68.0  94.0) and 86.5%(95% CI 53.5  96.1)  respectively.The Phase 3 MELODY trial (Trial 04) was a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial conducted across 21 countries designed to determine the safety and efficacy of Beyfortus against medically attended LRTD caused by RSV in healthy term and late preterm infants (35 weeks gestational age or greater) entering their first RSV season  including efficacy against severe disease such as hospitalization  through 150 days after dosing. The primary endpoint was met  reducing the incidence of medically attended RSV LRTD by 74.9% (95% CI 50.6  87.3; P<0.001) compared to placebo. The efficacy of Beyfortus against the secondary endpoint of hospitalization was 60.2% (95% CI: -14.6  86.2).MEDLEY (Trial 05) was a Phase 2/3  randomized  double-blind  palivizumab-controlled trial with the primary objective of assessing safety and tolerability for Beyfortus in preterm infants of less than 35 weeks’ gestational age and infants with congenital heart disease (CHD) and/or chronic lung disease (CLD) of prematurity eligible to receive palivizumab. Between July 2019 and May 2021  a total of 925 infants at higher risk for severe RSV disease entering their first RSV season were randomized to receive Beyfortus or palivizumab. Safety was assessed by monitoring the occurrence of treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and treatment emergent severe adverse events (TESAEs) through 360 days post-dose. Serum levels of Beyfortus following dosing (on day 151) in this trial were comparable with those observed in the Phase 3 MELODY trial (Trial 04)  indicating similar protection in this population to that in healthy term and late preterm infants is likely.The safety profile of Beyfortus was similar to palivizumab in the MEDLEY Phase 2/3 trial and consistent with the safety profile in healthy term  late preterm and preterm infants compared to placebo across the MELODY and Phase 2b trials. While uncommon  the most reported adverse reactions were rash 14 days post-dose  (the majority of which were mild to moderate) and non-serious injection site reactions within 7 days post-dose.The results of MELODY  Phase 2/3 MEDLEY and the Phase 2b trials illustrate that Beyfortus helps protect infants during their first RSV season against RSV disease with a single dose. This all-infant population includes healthy term  late preterm  and preterm infants  as well as infants with specific health conditions that make them vulnerable to severe RSV disease.These trials form the basis of regulatory submissions that began in 2022.About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives.

The coupon rate  which was determined in accordance with the provisions described in conditions 5(c) and 5(e) of the terms and conditions of the Securities  will be applicable to the coupon period that begins onJuly 15  2023 and ends on October 15  2023.Due to the cessation of USD LIBOR  the calculation agent was unable to determine the 10-year USD LIBOR ICE swap rate or to obtain the 10-year USD LIBOR swap rate quotations required to calculate an alternative comparable swap rate. Subsequently  the trustee has determined the coupon rate for the next coupon period on the basis of the USD SOFR spread-adjusted ICE swap rate as published by ICE Benchmark Administration  which is in line with the methodology suggested by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC) in its white paper. The resulting coupon rate is the aggregate of (i) the 10-year USD SOFR ICE swap rate as of July 13  2023  (ii) a spread adjustment of 0.28694% and (iii) a credit spread of 0.10%. The spread adjustment is based on the fallback formula proposed by the ARRC  and the aggregate of (i) and (ii) is equal to the USD SOFR spread-adjusted ICE swap rate.ContactsMedia relations Investor relations Richard Mackillican Hielke Hielkema +31(0) 62 741 1546 +31(0) 70 344 7697 richard.mackillican@aegon.com hielke.hielkema@aegon.comAbout AegonAegon is an international financial services holding company.

July 17  2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Zai Lab Limited (NASDAQ: ZLAB; HKEX: 9688) and argenx SE (Euronext & Nasdaq: ARGX) today announced positive topline results from the ADHERE study evaluating VYVGART Hytrulo (efgartigimod alfa and hyaluronidase-qvfc) in adults with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). The study met its primary endpoint (p=0.000039)  demonstrating a significantly lower risk of relapse with VYVGART Hytrulo compared to placebo. Detailed data from ADHERE will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting.ADHERE HighlightsPrimary endpoint met (p=0.000039); VYVGART Hytrulo demonstrated 61% reduction (HR: 0.39 95% CI: 0.25; 0.61) in the risk of relapse versus placebo67% of patients in open-label Stage A demonstrated evidence of clinical improvement (ECI)  indicating that IgG autoantibodies play a significant role in the underlying biology of CIDPSafety and tolerability profile consistent with confirmed safety profile of VYVGART91% (226/249) of eligible patients continued to the ADHERE-Plus open-label extension study“CIDP is a rare chronic immune-mediated peripheral neuropathy characterized by weakness and sensory dysfunction in the limbs  significantly impacting the daily life and work of patients ” said Dr. Chongbo Zhao  M.D.  Ph.D.  Deputy Director of Department of Neurology  Huashan Hospital Affiliated to Fudan University  Director of Working Group of Huashan Rare Disease Center. “Currently  intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg)  plasma exchange (PLEX)  and glucocorticoids are the main treatments used during the induction and maintenance phases. However  the accessibility and convenience of IVIg and PLEX are limited  and glucocorticoids have significant side effects  leaving urgent needs for treatment options that are more effective and safe. We are excited about the therapeutic potential of VYVGART Hytrulo  a promising treatment that may become a therapeutic alternative for CIDP in China.”“The positive ADHERE trial data provides strong clinical evidence that VYVGART Hytrulo meaningfully improves and stabilizes disease symptoms in CIDP patients with a favorable safety profile and a simple route of administration ” said Dr. Harald Reinhart  President and Head of Global Development  Neuroscience  Autoimmune & Infectious Diseases  Zai Lab. “We are proud to have contributed to the ADHERE study and are looking forward to working with our partner to bringing this therapy to CIDP patients in China.”Detailed ADHERE ResultsADHERE is the largest clinical trial of CIDP patients to date  enrolling adults who were treatment naïve (not on active treatment within the past six months) or currently on immunoglobulin therapy or corticosteroids. The trial consisted of a run-in period where current treatment was stopped followed by an open-label Stage A  after which responders to VYVGART Hytrulo advanced to a randomized  placebo-controlled Stage B.322 patients enrolled in Stage A and received treatment with VYVGART Hytrulo.67% (214/322) demonstrated evidence of clinical improvement (ECI) after a run-in withdrawal period based on the Inflammatory Neuropathy Cause and Treatment (INCAT) Disability Score  the Inflammatory Rasch-built Overall Disability Scale (I-RODS) or grip strength70% (214/304) demonstrated ECI excluding patients ongoing in Stage A at the time of the 88 th event who did not have the full opportunity to achieve a responseevent who did not have the full opportunity to achieve a response 78% (214/275) demonstrated ECI in a sensitivity analysis of patients who received at least four injections to reach the full IgG-lowering effect of VYVGART HytruloResponse rates similar across all prior CIDP medication subgroups with consistent efficacy on INCAT  I-RODS and grip strength221 responders from Stage A entered Stage B  where the primary endpoint was the relative risk of relapse based on time to relapse on the INCAT Disability Score.VYVGART Hytrulo significantly reduced the risk of CIDP relapse compared to placebo Primary endpoint was met (p=0.000039); VYVGART Hytrulo demonstrated a 61% reduction (HR: 0.39 95% CI: 0.25; 0.61) in the risk of relapse compared to placebo based on time to the first adjusted INCAT deterioration of ≥1 point VYVGART Hytrulo patients had a lower relapse rate compared to placebo at Week 24 (26% versus 54%) and Week 48 (34% versus 60%) VYVGART Hytrulo patients experienced longer time to relapse compared to those on placebo with a rapid separation of the Kaplan–Meier curves beginning at Week 4 and sustained through Week 48 VYVGART Hytrulo patients demonstrated a clinically meaningful mean improvement of 7.7 points on I-RODS and 12.3kPa on grip strength in Stage A. This clinically meaningful benefit was maintained in Stage B by treated patients and lost in placebo patients Clinical benefit observed across all efficacy scales and patient subgroups  regardless of prior therapyVYVGART Hytrulo was well-tolerated with a safety profile that is consistent with prior clinical trials and the known profile of VYVGART. The most frequent treatment-related adverse event was injection site reactions (ISRs)  which occurred in a lower percentage of patients than previous VYVGART Hytrulo trials (20% in Stage A; 10% in Stage B). All ISRs were mild to moderate and resolved over time.Zai Lab has an exclusive license agreement with argenx for the development and commercialization of VYVGART and VYVGART Hytrulo in Greater China. Through this agreement  Zai Lab dosed the first patient in the Greater China portion of the global registrational ADHERE trial in November 2021  and contributed a significant number of patients into this trial.About ADHERE Trial DesignThe ADHERE trial was a multicenter  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial evaluating VYVGART® Hytrulo (efgartigimod alfa and hyaluronidase-qvfc) for the treatment of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). ADHERE enrolled 322 adult patients with CIDP who were treatment naïve (not on active treatment within the past six months or newly diagnosed) or being treated with immunoglobulin therapy or corticosteroids. The trial consisted of an open-label Stage A followed by a randomized  placebo-controlled Stage B. In order to be eligible for the trial  the diagnosis of CIDP was confirmed by an independent panel of experts. Patients entered a run-in stage  where any ongoing CIDP treatment was stopped and in order to be eligible for Stage A had to demonstrate active disease  with clinically meaningful worsening on at least one CIDP clinical assessment tool  including INCAT  I-RODS  or mean grip strength. Treatment naïve patients were able to skip the run-in period with proof of recent worsening. To advance to Stage B  patients needed to demonstrate evidence of clinical improvement (ECI) with VYVGART Hytrulo. ECI was achieved through improvement of the INCAT score  or improvement on I-RODS or mean grip strength if those scales had demonstrated worsening during the run-in period. In Stage B  patients were randomized to either VYVGART Hytrulo or placebo for up to 48 weeks. The primary endpoint was measured once 88 total relapses or events were achieved in Stage B and was based on the hazard ratio for the time to first adjusted INCAT deterioration (i.e. relapse). After Stage B  all patients had the option to roll-over to an open-label extension study to receive VYVGART Hytrulo.About Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating PolyneuropathyChronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is a rare and serious autoimmune disease of the peripheral nervous system. Although confirmation of disease pathophysiology is still emerging  there is increasing evidence that IgG antibodies play a key role in the damage to the peripheral nerves. People with CIDP experience fatigue  muscle weakness and a loss of feeling in their arms and legs that can get worse over time or may come and go. These symptoms can significantly impair a person's ability to function in their daily lives. Without treatment  one-third of people living with CIDP will need a wheelchair.About CIDP in ChinaThe prevalence of CIDP in China is estimated at 50 000 patients.1 Current treatment options are primarily corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg)  with plasma exchange (PLEX) generally reserved for refractory patients. There is limited access to PLEX or IVIg in many parts of the world  including China. As most patients require treatment for an extended period of time there remains a significant unmet need for alternate treatment options that are effective  well-tolerated  and convenient for patients with CIDP in China.1 Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy and diabetes  2020.About VYVGART® HytruloVYVGART Hytrulo is a subcutaneous combination of efgartigimod alfa  a human IgG1 antibody fragment marketed for intravenous use as VYVGART®  and recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20)  Halozyme’s ENHANZE® drug delivery technology to facilitate subcutaneous injection delivery of biologics.

27868,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/24562/fx-2023---trends-and-opportunities,FX 2023 - Trends and Opportunities (Chandresh Pande),Executive Summary  The institutional FX market is evolving at a rapid pace. World events like the C...,Executive SummaryThe institutional FX market is evolving at a rapid pace. World events like the Covid pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war have led to worldwide supply chain shortages pushing inflation to unprecedented levels in major economies. Central banks are responding by adjusting the interest rates  which has a knock-on effect on FX demand and supply dynamics  causing market volatility spikes. Apart from these macroeconomic changes  an ever-increasing regulatory ask  an explosion of data and its technological ramifications on the trading infrastructure are threatening the status quo of the traditional FX marketplace. The writing is pretty much on the wall - traditional FX ecosystems are undergoing a swift changeover  and the participants who do not act in time to adapt to the changing order will have their clocks cleaned.In this paper  we first highlight some key trends evolving in the FX value chains due to the changing dynamics of the FX marketplace. Then we list down a few opportunities these trends open for the different FX participants that may help them navigate through these turbulent times with flying colors.Growth in FX Trading Volumes (Avg. Daily Volumes) in the last two decades2004 - 1.94 trillion $2007 - 3.33 trillion $2010 - 3.98 trillion $2013 - 5.36 trillion $2016 - 5.07 trillion $2019 - 6.59 trillion $2022 - 7.51 trillion $TrendsMacroeconomicsThe FX volumes continue to pile. The global FX turnover continued its upswing and reached a staggering $ 7.5 trillion per day in 2022  up 14% from 2019. It stands approximately equal to one-third of the estimated annual GDP of the USA in 2023.Volatility makes a comeback. Volatility and turbulence in FX markets have made an uptick since the last year due to multiple disruptive macroeconomic events and hawkish interest rate policies adopted by countries to counter their economic impact.Market StructureRapid evolution of FX clearing. Traditional pure “OTC” play in FX markets is being challenged as cleared workflows are gaining traction due to regulatory demands of minimizing bilateral credit exposure (as per the UMR and SA-CCR directives). The Cleared FX volumes (especially NDF “Non-deliverable forward” clearing) show a distinct rise1 3. The volumes may increase further  spurred by the buy side demand and adoption of new  innovative product offerings (like Blocks4  Exchange for Physicals5) by various exchanges like CME and Eurex.Further fragmentation of liquidity pools is on the cards. FX trading seems to be moving away from multilateral platforms towards private  bilateral methods (ex. via single dealer platforms  via client portals or direct trading) as per the latest BIS 2022 triennial survey2 of FX markets.Threat from new entrants. Non-Banking electronic market makers like Citadel  Virtu  Jump Trading etc.  are challenging the erstwhile monopoly of traditional FX Dealers in market making. These firms leverage technology (ex. high frequency algorithmic trading strategies) to gain competitive advantage  and their share  especially in spot e-trading with buy-side clients is on the rise.Electronic trading is on the rise. Electronic trading of NDFs and FX Swaps has risen significantly1 2 over the last few years. NDFs are increasingly being used by Hedge funds and PTFs10 for taking directional bets and executing arbitrage strategies. FX Swaps provide a natural choice for dealers and smaller banks to meet their funding and hedging requirements. Growing volumes of these products will push greater electronification in trading by streaming and CLOB (central limit order book) based trading models.High levels of settlement risk exposure. There is considerable settlement risk in the FX markets. As per the latest BIS 2022 triennial report2  “FX settlement risk… can result in significant losses and undermine financial stability. Netting and payment versus payment (PvP) mechanisms help to mitigate this risk. However  almost a third of deliverable FX turnover  or $2.2 trillion  was still at risk on any given day in April 2022  up from $1.9 trillion in April 20192”.The FX global code9 also calls for market participants to eliminate their settlement risk by using PvP arrangements whenever practicable or by using bilateral/multilateral netting of settlement obligations.Business ModelsDemand for digital. A wider range of firms lead by high alpha seeking Hedge funds and PTFs10 are increasingly demanding access to more digital currency exposure. Market participants are therefore looking for safe  legal and compliant ways to trade digital currencies.Listed FX and OTC under the same roof. Acquisition of independent OTC e-trading venues/aggregators by exchanges (for ex. Deutsche Bourse and 360T  LSEG and Refinitiv FXAll  Euronext and Fastmatch etc.) to offer their customers efficiencies of trading OTC and listed FX under one roof has been an ongoing trend since last few years.Product innovation is the way to go. Innovative trading models and products will drive efficiency  reduce redundant processes  and generate new revenue opportunities.Technology and AnalyticsAnalytics-driven future. Data Analytics will play a critical role across pre  during and post-trade phases bestowing multiple benefits to participants like increased transparency  ensuring best execution  reducing costs and generating new  actionable business insights.Increased demand on technology. The need for faster  automated trading workflows  better risk tools  the ability to handle burgeoning datasets and seamless API based integrations will drive the next wave of technology upgrades by all market participants. It will also help them reduce operational costs and improve overall profitability.OpportunitiesLiquidity Makers - Bank and Non-Bank financial institutions1) Operating model improvisationsLiquidity Providers will need to upgrade their technology systems to leaner  faster  scalable versions across front to back. It will enable them to handle challenges like latency reduction  abrupt volume spikes  real-time credit assessment  reduction in order hold times  modification of custom price streams for different clients in changing market conditions etc.  to remain competitive in a heavily crowded marketplace.Ability to electronically connect real-time (via APIs) with multiple liquidity pools. Thus  the distribution of liquidity smartly to various channels will increase profitability.2) Enhancing customer value propositionThe buy-side increasingly demand access to cross-asset liquidity from their execution platforms as many begin operating multi-asset trading desks.An increase in demand for prime brokerage offerings and algorithmic trading from the buy-side will lead to algorithmic optimizations and sophisticated  transparent routing models.Connectivity is needed with a) clearing houses to allow customers access to cleared liquidity and to be able to report bilateral trades for post-trade clearing and b) settlement systems to reduce credit/settlement risk exposure and shrink funding requirements.The ability to trade FX options electronically (via “request for quote” RFQ  streaming  CLOB mechanisms) with clients and auto-pricing even amidst high volatility could bring in significant gains for liquidity providers as buy-side look for high-return trading opportunities because of increased volatility.Liquidity Takers - Asset Managers and other financial institutionsDemand for analytics-driven insights around pricing quality  execution metrics  transaction costs  counterparty and venue performance to find better ways to source and interact with liquidity.Access to peer-to-peer trading platforms is starting to gain more traction from institutional investors as an alternate source of liquidity.Adoption of trade automation will help the buy-side firms ensure execution consistency  at the same time freeing up trader bandwidth that can be aligned to working on more complex  high-touch orders.Seamless integration of Order Management system (OMS) and Execution Management system (EMS) to gain operational efficiencies and reduce high standalone costs of running these disparate platforms.Liquidity Takers - Corporate treasuries and other non-financial institutionsStrong demand for better Ui/Ux experience and automated integration of the trading venue with their Treasury and risk management systems (TMS).Growth in demand for white-labelled solutions to consolidate and hedge liquidity requirements from multiple subsidiaries and branches.Exchanges and Clearing housesIntroduction of new innovative trading products and workflows offering more execution options to participants. For example  “rolling spot” futures7 offered by Eurex are perpetual self-rolling contracts that mimic OTC spot.Expanding the anonymous  order-driven CLOB trading model to products like emerging markets futures and FX Swaps  which are gaining demand as demonstrated by growing year-on-year volumes2.Electronic trading venues and Multilateral trading facilities (MTFs)Technology and business process innovations will pave the way for new revenue generation opportunities as trading moves towards disclosed  bilateral workflows2. For example  innovative credit intermediation solutions to de-couple credit and liquidity (like offering prime-brokered and prime-of-prime liquidity flows and other partnership-based models) will help draw client flow back towards MTFs.Introduction of API-based e-trading workflows like streaming and CLOB for (non-spot) products like NDFs  Swaps and Options.The inclusion of e-trading of digital currencies along with traditional FX Products will attract traction from PTFs10 and Hedge funds.Aggregated service providers will increase their customer base as participants look for consolidated liquidity across venues.Opportunity for providers of data analytics tools  artificial intelligence and machine learning solutions as participants look to use technology to reduce costs  mitigate risks  detect fraudulent activity and optimize decision-making  especially across their sales  trading and risk functions.Direct connectivity with settlement systems (ex. CLS) is imperative as market participants look to reduce their settlement and credit risk exposures.Settlement infrastructureInnovative use of technology to enable more participants to adopt PvP settlement. For example  driving down the costs of joining PvP arrangements may attract smaller players to integrate directly or via a direct participant.There is a scope for prospective and incumbent settlement systems to settle more currencies in PvP mode. CLS  a major player in this space  can settle 18 major currencies8 at present.Local nostro agents and central banks may work to extend their payment system uptimes to support PvP settlement across multiple geographies/time zones.ConclusionFX markets are undergoing a quick makeover buoyed by several micro- and macro-economic factors. Volatility returned and provided both a challenge and an opportunity. Trading volumes spiked to unprecedented levels as participants looked to hedge their currency risk and took speculative positions amidst high volatility. Interdealer trading increased  while trading by dealers with customers stagnated. Trading moved away from MTFs towards private  bilateral mechanisms  further fragmenting the marketplace and making it less transparent. Technological innovations continue to disrupt and drive the FX ecosystem into newer and exciting ventures like faster trading  flexible execution  digital currency  advanced risk management  cross-border payments and cutting-edge analytics. We expect a significant transformation of the FX landscape in the next few years as we continue to keep a pulse of these themes in the future as well.References10. “Proprietary trading firms” (PTFs) definition as per the Triennial Central Bank Survey of foreign exchange and over the counter (OTC) derivatives markets in 2022,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.14,0.11,0.76,True,English,"['Chandresh Pande', 'FX', 'Trends', 'Opportunities', 'high frequency algorithmic trading strategies', 'latest BIS 2022 triennial survey2', 'latest BIS 2022 triennial report', 'worldwide supply chain shortages', 'independent OTC e-trading venues', 'multiple disruptive macroeconomic events', 'central limit order book', 'Traditional pure “OTC” play', 'new, innovative product offerings', 'Non-Banking electronic market makers', 'The FX global code9', 'bilateral credit exposure', 'private, bilateral methods', 'global FX turnover', 'traditional FX ecosystems', 'increasing regulatory ask', 'interest rate policies', 'deliverable forward” clearing', 'buy side demand', 'single dealer platforms', 'FX value chains', 'deliverable FX turnover', 'Avg.

The study met its primary endpoint (p=0.000039)  demonstrating a significantly lower risk of relapse with VYVGART Hytrulo compared to placebo. Detailed data from ADHERE will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting.ADHERE HighlightsPrimary endpoint met (p=0.000039); VYVGART Hytrulo demonstrated 61% reduction (HR: 0.39 95% CI: 0.25; 0.61) in the risk of relapse versus placebo67% of patients in open-label Stage A demonstrated evidence of clinical improvement (ECI)  indicating that IgG autoantibodies play a significant role in the underlying biology of CIDPSafety and tolerability profile consistent with confirmed safety profile of VYVGART91% (226/249) of eligible patients continued to the ADHERE-Plus open-label extension study""CIDP is a chronic  progressive autoimmune disease that can cause substantial disability in those affected  often leading to impaired ambulation or difficulty completing normal daily tasks without help. The positive ADHERE data show that VYVGART Hytrulo may represent a new patient-forward treatment option that can prevent symptom deterioration while minimizing side effects and treatment burden ” commented Jeffrey Allen  M.D.  Associate Professor  Department of Neurology  University of Minnesota. “With ADHERE  argenx has set a new standard for innovative CIDP studies that more broadly inform the neuromuscular community. The findings from the trial indicate we may have a novel weapon to combat this debilitating condition in our ongoing efforts to improve the lives of individuals affected by CIDP.”“People living with CIDP often experience significant challenges with daily function including fatigue  numbness  tingling  pain and weakness while facing a future with limited mobility or independence. The promising ADHERE data bring hope to the CIDP community of a brighter future where they could experience more positive moments doing the things that make them most happy ” said Lisa Butler  Executive Director of the GBS-CIDP Foundation International.“With these positive ADHERE data  we have generated strong clinical evidence that CIDP has a significant IgG-driven pathogenesis component and that VYVGART Hytrulo can meaningfully improve and stabilize disease symptoms with a favorable safety profile and a simple route of administration ” commented Luc Truyen  M.D.  Ph.D.  Chief Medical Officer of argenx. “We are very grateful to the patients participating in the ADHERE trial and their supporters  the investigators  our collaborators and our argenx colleagues for the success of this innovative trial. Together  we are moving one step closer to transforming the treatment of autoimmunity.”Detailed ADHERE ResultsADHERE is the largest clinical trial of CIDP patients to date  enrolling adults who were treatment naïve (not on active treatment within the past six months) or currently on immunoglobulin therapy or corticosteroids. The trial consisted of a run-in period where current treatment was stopped followed by an open-label Stage A  after which responders to VYVGART Hytrulo advanced to a randomized  placebo-controlled Stage B.322 patients enrolled in Stage A and received treatment with VYVGART Hytrulo67% (214/322) demonstrated evidence of clinical improvement (ECI) after a run-in withdrawal period based on the Inflammatory Neuropathy Cause and Treatment (INCAT) Disability Score  the Inflammatory Rasch-built Overall Disability Scale (I-RODS) or grip strength70% (214/304) demonstrated ECI excluding patients ongoing in Stage A at the time of the 88 th event who did not have the full opportunity to achieve a responseevent who did not have the full opportunity to achieve a response 78% (214/275) demonstrated ECI in a sensitivity analysis of patients who received at least four injections to reach the full IgG-lowering effect of VYVGART HytruloResponse rates similar across all prior CIDP medication subgroups with consistent efficacy on INCAT  I-RODS and grip strength.221 responders from Stage A entered Stage B  where the primary endpoint was the relative risk of relapse based on time to relapse on the INCAT Disability ScoreVYVGART Hytrulo significantly reduced the risk of CIDP relapse compared to placebo Primary endpoint was met (p=0.000039); VYVGART Hytrulo demonstrated a 61% reduction (HR: 0.39 95% CI: 0.25; 0.61) in the risk of relapse compared to placebo based on time to the first adjusted INCAT deterioration of ≥1 point VYVGART Hytrulo patients had a lower relapse rate compared to placebo at Week 24 (26% versus 54%) and Week 48 (34% versus 60%) VYVGART Hytrulo patients experienced longer time to relapse compared to those on placebo with a rapid separation of the Kaplan–Meier curves beginning at Week 4 and sustained through Week 48 VYVGART Hytrulo patients demonstrated a clinically meaningful mean improvement of 7.7 points on I-RODS and 12.3kPa on grip strength in Stage A. This clinically meaningful benefit was maintained in Stage B by treated patients and lost in placebo patients. Clinical benefit observed across all efficacy scales and patient subgroups  regardless of prior therapyVYVGART Hytrulo was well-tolerated with a safety profile that is consistent with prior clinical trials and the known profile of VYVGART. The most frequent treatment-related adverse event was injection site reactions (ISRs)  which occurred in a lower percentage of patients than previous VYVGART Hytrulo trials (20% in Stage A; 10% in Stage B). All ISRs were mild to moderate and resolved over time.Conference Call Detailsargenx will host a conference call today at 2:30pm CET (8:30am ET) to discuss the ADHERE results.

ADHERE enrolled 322 adult patients with CIDP who were treatment naïve (not on active treatment within the past six months or newly diagnosed) or being treated with immunoglobulin therapy or corticosteroids. The trial consisted of an open-label Stage A followed by a randomized  placebo-controlled Stage B. In order to be eligible for the trial  the diagnosis of CIDP was confirmed by an independent panel of experts. Patients entered a run-in stage  where any ongoing CIDP treatment was stopped and in order to be eligible for Stage A had to demonstrate active disease  with clinically meaningful worsening on at least one CIDP clinical assessment tool  including INCAT  I-RODS  or mean grip strength. Treatment naïve patients were able to skip the run-in period with proof of recent worsening. To advance to Stage B  patients needed to demonstrate evidence of clinical improvement (ECI) with VYVGART Hytrulo. ECI was achieved through improvement of the INCAT score  or improvement on I-RODS or mean grip strength if those scales had demonstrated worsening during the run-in period. In Stage B  patients were randomized to either VYVGART Hytrulo or placebo for up to 48 weeks. The primary endpoint was measured once 88 total relapses or events were achieved in Stage B and was based on the hazard ratio for the time to first adjusted INCAT deterioration (i.e. relapse). After Stage B  all patients had the option to roll-over to an open-label extension study to receive VYVGART Hytrulo.argenx has an exclusive license agreement with Zai Lab for the development and commercialization of VYVGART and VYVGART Hytrulo in Greater China. Through this agreement  Zai Lab recruited Chinese patients into the ADHERE trial.About Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating PolyneuropathyChronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is a rare and serious autoimmune disease of the peripheral nervous system. Although confirmation of disease pathophysiology is still emerging  there is increasing evidence that IgG antibodies play a key role in the damage to the peripheral nerves. People with CIDP experience fatigue  muscle weakness and a loss of feeling in their arms and legs that can get worse over time or may come and go. These symptoms can significantly impair a person's ability to function in their daily lives. Without treatment  one-third of people living with CIDP will need a wheelchair.About VYVGART® HytruloVYVGART Hytrulo is a subcutaneous combination of efgartigimod alfa  a human IgG1 antibody fragment marketed for intravenous use as VYVGART®  and recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20)  Halozyme’s ENHANZE® drug delivery technology to facilitate subcutaneous injection delivery of biologics. In binding to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)  VYVGART Hytrulo results in the reduction of circulating IgG. It is the first-and-only approved FcRn blocker administered by subcutaneous injection.VYVGART Hytrulo is the proprietary name in the U.S. for subcutaneous efgartigimod alfa and recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20. It may be marketed under different proprietary names following approval in other regions.See Important Safety Information below and full Prescribing Information for VYVGART Hytrulo for additional informationImportant Safety InformationWhat is VYVGART® HYTRULO (efgartigimod alfa and hyaluronidase-qvfc)?VYVGART HYTRULO is a prescription medicine used to treat a condition called generalized myasthenia gravis  which causes muscles to tire and weaken easily throughout the body  in adults who are positive for antibodies directed toward a protein called acetylcholine receptor (anti-AChR antibody positive).IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONWhat is the most important information I should know about VYVGART HYTRULO?VYVGART HYTRULO may cause serious side effects  including:Infection. VYVGART HYTRULO may increase the risk of infection. The most common infections for efgartigimod alfa-fcab-treated patients were urinary tract and respiratory tract infections. More patients on efgartigimod alfa-fcab vs placebo had below normal levels for white blood cell counts  lymphocyte counts  and neutrophil counts. The majority of infections and observed lower white blood cell counts were mild to moderate in severity. Your healthcare provider should check you for infections before starting treatment  during treatment  and after treatment with VYVGART HYTRULO. Tell your healthcare provider if you have any history of infections. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have signs or symptoms of an infection during treatment with VYVGART HYTRULO such as fever  chills  frequent and/or painful urination  cough  pain and blockage of nasal passages/sinus  wheezing  shortness of breath  fatigue  sore throat  excess phlegm  nasal discharge  back pain  and/or chest pain. If a serious infection occurs  your doctor will treat your infection and may even stop your VYVGART HYTRULO treatment until the infection has resolved.VYVGART HYTRULO may increase the risk of infection.

VYVGART HYTRULO and efgartigimod alfa-fcab can cause the immune system to have undesirable reactions such as rashes  swelling under the skin  and shortness of breath. Hives were also observed in patients treated with VYVGART HYTRULO. In clinical studies  the reactions were mild or moderate and occurred within 1 hour to 3 weeks of administration  and the reactions did not lead to VYVGART HYTRULO discontinuation. Your healthcare provider should monitor you during and after treatment and discontinue VYVGART HYTRULO if needed. Tell your healthcare provider immediately about any undesirable reactions to VYVGART HYTRULO.Before taking VYVGART HYTRULO  tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions  including if you:Have a history of infection or you think you have an infection.Have received or are scheduled to receive a vaccine (immunization). Discuss with your healthcare provider whether you need to receive age-appropriate immunizations before initiation of a new treatment cycle with VYVGART HYTRULO. The use of vaccines during VYVGART HYTRULO treatment has not been studied  and the safety with live or live-attenuated vaccines is unknown. Administration of live or live-attenuated vaccines is not recommended during treatment with VYVGART HYTRULO.Are pregnant or plan to become pregnant and are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed.Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take  including prescription and over-the-counter medicines  vitamins  and herbal supplements.What are the common side effects of VYVGART HYTRULO?The most common side effects of efgartigimod alfa-fcab-treated patients were respiratory tract infection  headache  and urinary tract infection. Additional common side effects of VYVGART HYTRULO are injection site reactions  including rash  redness of the skin  itching sensation  bruising  pain  and hives.These are not all the possible side effects of VYVGART HYTRULO.

The study met its primary endpoint (p=0.000039)  demonstrating a significantly lower risk of relapse with VYVGART Hytrulo compared to placebo. Detailed data from ADHERE will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting.ADHERE HighlightsPrimary endpoint met (p=0.000039); VYVGART Hytrulo demonstrated 61% reduction (HR: 0.39 95% CI: 0.25; 0.61) in the risk of relapse versus placebo67% of patients in open-label Stage A demonstrated evidence of clinical improvement (ECI)  indicating that IgG autoantibodies play a significant role in the underlying biology of CIDPSafety and tolerability profile consistent with confirmed safety profile of VYVGART91% (226/249) of eligible patients continued to the ADHERE-Plus open-label extension study""CIDP is a chronic  progressive autoimmune disease that can cause substantial disability in those affected  often leading to impaired ambulation or difficulty completing normal daily tasks without help. The positive ADHERE data show that VYVGART Hytrulo may represent a new patient-forward treatment option that can prevent symptom deterioration while minimizing side effects and treatment burden ” commented Jeffrey Allen  M.D.  Associate Professor  Department of Neurology  University of Minnesota. “With ADHERE  argenx has set a new standard for innovative CIDP studies that more broadly inform the neuromuscular community. The findings from the trial indicate we may have a novel weapon to combat this debilitating condition in our ongoing efforts to improve the lives of individuals affected by CIDP.”“People living with CIDP often experience significant challenges with daily function including fatigue  numbness  tingling  pain and weakness while facing a future with limited mobility or independence. The promising ADHERE data bring hope to the CIDP community of a brighter future where they could experience more positive moments doing the things that make them most happy ” said Lisa Butler  Executive Director of the GBS-CIDP Foundation International.“With these positive ADHERE data  we have generated strong clinical evidence that CIDP has a significant IgG-driven pathogenesis component and that VYVGART Hytrulo can meaningfully improve and stabilize disease symptoms with a favorable safety profile and a simple route of administration ” commented Luc Truyen  M.D.  Ph.D.  Chief Medical Officer of argenx. “We are very grateful to the patients participating in the ADHERE trial and their supporters  the investigators  our collaborators and our argenx colleagues for the success of this innovative trial. Together  we are moving one step closer to transforming the treatment of autoimmunity.”Detailed ADHERE ResultsADHERE is the largest clinical trial of CIDP patients to date  enrolling adults who were treatment naïve (not on active treatment within the past six months) or currently on immunoglobulin therapy or corticosteroids. The trial consisted of a run-in period where current treatment was stopped followed by an open-label Stage A  after which responders to VYVGART Hytrulo advanced to a randomized  placebo-controlled Stage B.322 patients enrolled in Stage A and received treatment with VYVGART Hytrulo67% (214/322) demonstrated evidence of clinical improvement (ECI) after a run-in withdrawal period based on the Inflammatory Neuropathy Cause and Treatment (INCAT) Disability Score  the Inflammatory Rasch-built Overall Disability Scale (I-RODS) or grip strength70% (214/304) demonstrated ECI excluding patients ongoing in Stage A at the time of the 88 th event who did not have the full opportunity to achieve a responseevent who did not have the full opportunity to achieve a response 78% (214/275) demonstrated ECI in a sensitivity analysis of patients who received at least four injections to reach the full IgG-lowering effect of VYVGART HytruloResponse rates similar across all prior CIDP medication subgroups with consistent efficacy on INCAT  I-RODS and grip strength.221 responders from Stage A entered Stage B  where the primary endpoint was the relative risk of relapse based on time to relapse on the INCAT Disability ScoreVYVGART Hytrulo significantly reduced the risk of CIDP relapse compared to placebo Primary endpoint was met (p=0.000039); VYVGART Hytrulo demonstrated a 61% reduction (HR: 0.39 95% CI: 0.25; 0.61) in the risk of relapse compared to placebo based on time to the first adjusted INCAT deterioration of ≥1 point VYVGART Hytrulo patients had a lower relapse rate compared to placebo at Week 24 (26% versus 54%) and Week 48 (34% versus 60%) VYVGART Hytrulo patients experienced longer time to relapse compared to those on placebo with a rapid separation of the Kaplan–Meier curves beginning at Week 4 and sustained through Week 48 VYVGART Hytrulo patients demonstrated a clinically meaningful mean improvement of 7.7 points on I-RODS and 12.3kPa on grip strength in Stage A. This clinically meaningful benefit was maintained in Stage B by treated patients and lost in placebo patients. Clinical benefit observed across all efficacy scales and patient subgroups  regardless of prior therapyVYVGART Hytrulo was well-tolerated with a safety profile that is consistent with prior clinical trials and the known profile of VYVGART. The most frequent treatment-related adverse event was injection site reactions (ISRs)  which occurred in a lower percentage of patients than previous VYVGART Hytrulo trials (20% in Stage A; 10% in Stage B). All ISRs were mild to moderate and resolved over time.Conference Call Detailsargenx will host a conference call today at 2:30pm CET (8:30am ET) to discuss the ADHERE results.

ADHERE enrolled 322 adult patients with CIDP who were treatment naïve (not on active treatment within the past six months or newly diagnosed) or being treated with immunoglobulin therapy or corticosteroids. The trial consisted of an open-label Stage A followed by a randomized  placebo-controlled Stage B. In order to be eligible for the trial  the diagnosis of CIDP was confirmed by an independent panel of experts. Patients entered a run-in stage  where any ongoing CIDP treatment was stopped and in order to be eligible for Stage A had to demonstrate active disease  with clinically meaningful worsening on at least one CIDP clinical assessment tool  including INCAT  I-RODS  or mean grip strength. Treatment naïve patients were able to skip the run-in period with proof of recent worsening. To advance to Stage B  patients needed to demonstrate evidence of clinical improvement (ECI) with VYVGART Hytrulo. ECI was achieved through improvement of the INCAT score  or improvement on I-RODS or mean grip strength if those scales had demonstrated worsening during the run-in period. In Stage B  patients were randomized to either VYVGART Hytrulo or placebo for up to 48 weeks. The primary endpoint was measured once 88 total relapses or events were achieved in Stage B and was based on the hazard ratio for the time to first adjusted INCAT deterioration (i.e. relapse). After Stage B  all patients had the option to roll-over to an open-label extension study to receive VYVGART Hytrulo.argenx has an exclusive license agreement with Zai Lab for the development and commercialization of VYVGART and VYVGART Hytrulo in Greater China. Through this agreement  Zai Lab recruited Chinese patients into the ADHERE trial.About Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating PolyneuropathyChronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is a rare and serious autoimmune disease of the peripheral nervous system. Although confirmation of disease pathophysiology is still emerging  there is increasing evidence that IgG antibodies play a key role in the damage to the peripheral nerves. People with CIDP experience fatigue  muscle weakness and a loss of feeling in their arms and legs that can get worse over time or may come and go. These symptoms can significantly impair a person's ability to function in their daily lives. Without treatment  one-third of people living with CIDP will need a wheelchair.About VYVGART® HytruloVYVGART Hytrulo is a subcutaneous combination of efgartigimod alfa  a human IgG1 antibody fragment marketed for intravenous use as VYVGART®  and recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20)  Halozyme’s ENHANZE® drug delivery technology to facilitate subcutaneous injection delivery of biologics. In binding to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)  VYVGART Hytrulo results in the reduction of circulating IgG. It is the first-and-only approved FcRn blocker administered by subcutaneous injection.VYVGART Hytrulo is the proprietary name in the U.S. for subcutaneous efgartigimod alfa and recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20. It may be marketed under different proprietary names following approval in other regions.See Important Safety Information below and full Prescribing Information for VYVGART Hytrulo for additional informationImportant Safety InformationWhat is VYVGART® HYTRULO (efgartigimod alfa and hyaluronidase-qvfc)?VYVGART HYTRULO is a prescription medicine used to treat a condition called generalized myasthenia gravis  which causes muscles to tire and weaken easily throughout the body  in adults who are positive for antibodies directed toward a protein called acetylcholine receptor (anti-AChR antibody positive).IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONWhat is the most important information I should know about VYVGART HYTRULO?VYVGART HYTRULO may cause serious side effects  including:Infection. VYVGART HYTRULO may increase the risk of infection. The most common infections for efgartigimod alfa-fcab-treated patients were urinary tract and respiratory tract infections.

Learn more about STLA stock here.,"peepoWelcome to my 100th analysis published on Seeking Alpha!Although it feels like yesterday  it has already been seven years of fruitful investing since my first contribution in June 2016. Despite never picking a specific market niche  my research has primarily covered REITs  high-yield picks  and European companies.In today's article  I will indeed stick ""to the basics"" of my coverage  deep diving into a high-yielding European company: Euronext Milan and Euronext Paris-listed European carmaker Stellantis (NYSE:STLA). With a well-covered 8% dividend yield  Stellantis is a core holding of mine for the high-yield basket allocation. The stock remains underappreciated and undervalued by the market  and I expect double-digit returns for patient investors over the long term.However  there is more than meets the eye of this traditional ICE incumbent player. Beyond car sales  Stellantis is preparing for long-term success  transforming itself into a ""mobility tech company"" that produces ""intelligent vehicles"" thanks to widespread AI advancements and adoption. The company plans to invest more than €30 billion in electrification and software through 2025  which it expects to pay back quickly and generate revenues of €60 billion for Stellantis by 2030. That's a decade-long 14.3% CAGR vs. the 2021 baseline!But let's take one step back and understand why Stellantis is a bargain today.The investment thesis todayStellantis is the company that resulted from the 2021 merger between Italian-American Fiat Chrysler (FCA) and French PSA Group. Anchor shareholders include the Italian Agnelli family  which controls about 14% of the shares through the family's holding Exor NV (OTCPK:EXXRF)  and the Peugeot family  which owns about 7% of STLA shares. The investment case revolves around a few key points:The synergies: the consummated merger between FCA and PSA can produce additional savings. Management's initial objective called for €5.0 billion in annual run-rate cash flow synergies  of which €4.0 billion by the end of 2024. The company announced the achievement of €7.1 billion at the end of 2022. Still  synergies obtainable through the combination of technology and vehicle platforms are yet to unfold fully  as it takes 2-3 years to bring new products to the market.the consummated merger between FCA and PSA can produce additional savings.

The company announced the achievement of €7.1 billion at the end of 2022. Still  synergies obtainable through the combination of technology and vehicle platforms are yet to unfold fully  as it takes 2-3 years to bring new products to the market. The CEO: Carlos Tavares is an industry veteran who transformed the PSA Group from a loss-making carmaker facing bankruptcy risks to a top-performing firm  all within six years. Between 2014 and 2018  PSA's operating income increased more than five-fold. Tavares' can unlock significant value in Stellantis by following a similar process.Carlos Tavares is an industry veteran who transformed the PSA Group from a loss-making carmaker facing bankruptcy risks to a top-performing firm  all within six years. Between 2014 and 2018  PSA's operating income increased more than five-fold. Tavares' can unlock significant value in Stellantis by following a similar process. The margins: Stellantis' revenues have dwindled in recent years. The company shunned unprofitable growth  and now its operating margins rank extremely high among automaker peers. The FY22 adjusted operating income margin hit 13%  driven by a 16.4% AOI margin in its North American segment and a 9.9% AOI margin in the more competitive European market. The company has minimal exposure to China  which I also view as a positive considering the ongoing tensions with the US.Stellantis' revenues have dwindled in recent years.

The balance sheet: while arguably not as strong as the A+ credit rating of Toyota (TM)  Stellantis has a solid investment-grade BBB credit rating from S&P and Baa2 from Moody's. What is even nicer  the company closed 2022 with €50.0 billion in liquidity against €18.4 billion in long-term debt. I expect the solid cash position to shield the company against even the most severe macro downturn.Stellantis 2022 20-FThe FY22 results indicate FCF generation of €10.8 billion  which against capitalization €52.6 billion  implies that Stellantis offer investors a free cash flow yield in excess of 20%. When considering its market cap and sales  the company appears undervalued vs. peers  suggesting a potential immediate upside of about 50% up for grabs. Indeed  an FCF yield of 13%-14% could be appropriate  considering that automotive is (traditionally) a highly cyclical industry. While the high level of indebtedness could justify Volkswagen (OTCPK:VWAGY) trading at the lower range of the below table  I don't find any acceptable reason for Stellantis to trade as low.And Value For All / Seeking Alpha data (Jul17th)Buy and hold!Even though the current valuation appears more than reasonable  I am not too concerned about determining precisely how much Stellantis is worth today. Stellantis' fair value today could be approximately €25 per share  but even if shares eventually reach that price  I'd advise against selling.The next decade is shaping up extremely promising for STLA shareholders. Like its controlling families  I plan to hold Stellantis in my portfolio for the long term  as the company is making the right moves in evolving beyond car manufacturing.Stellantis has published a long-term strategic plan  ""Dare Forward 2030 "" in which the company highlights its vision of transforming into a sustainable mobility tech company  with electrification and software playing a pivotal role:StellantisThe company aims to double its revenue base by 2030  reaching €300 billion in sales. However  shareholders should not worry about profitability because Stellantis plans to double its industrial free cash flow and reach an FCF of €20.0 billion by the end of the decade  representing an 8% CAGR.Can Stellantis get there despite the increasingly competitive space  with new EV makers trying to steal market share from the ICE incumbents?I believe so. Stellantis' strategic vision for 2030 centers on two pillars: converting ICE sales to BEV and expanding service and software revenues. In particular  Stellantis expects to generate 20% of its total sales  or approximately €60 billion  from services  up from €18 billion in 2021.Quietly moving behind the scenes  the spotlight perennially stolen by younger EV players and their CEOs  Stellantis has made significant moves to jump ahead of competitors. The company has been investing in new technology development centers  opening new ones in Europe and Asia just in the last twelve months  and signed strategic partnerships with Qualcomm (QCOM)  Amazon (AMZN)  and Waymo (GOOG  GOOGL) to support its tech-fueled long-term strategic plan.The Midnight ProjectStellantis announced back in January its commitment to support Archer Aviation (ACHR) in building the first commercially viable eVTOL aircraft  the Midnight. Under the agreement  STLA will contribute the necessary manufacturing technology  capital  and personnel.With rising interest rates making access to corporate debt more difficult  Archer could need to raise additional equity to make it to the finish line  and STLA is keeping an opportunistic approach. On the one hand  Stellantis committed to extending $150M of equity capital for a potential draw by Archer at its discretion in 2023 and 2024. That represents approximately 12.5% of Archer's current valuation. On the other hand  the company also reportedly kept an interest in further purchasing ACHR shares on the open market. Fast forward six months and STLA quickly sealed the deal by disclosing a 10.6% ownership stake that sent ACHR stock flying well before its aircraft.Archer AviationWe've been working closely with Archer for the past two years  and I am continually impressed by their ingenuity and unwavering commitment to deliver - Carlos Tavares  CEO of Stellantis.In its 2021 investors' deck  ACHR made bold financial predictions to reach approximately $12.3 billion in revenues  $4.5 billion EBITDA  and $2.8 billion FCF by the decade's end. With STLA ownership (acquired and committed) potentially already hovering around 20%  my bold prediction is that  before 2030  Stellantis could move in to own 50% of this company and proportionally consolidate results or even try to take it private  depending on how well things go with the Midnight.Archer Aviation - 2021 investors presentation deckA 50% ownership would capture about $1.4 billion (€1.2 billion) of the projected free cash flow  representing 6% of Stellantis' forecasted total for 2030.After all  it makes total sense to envision a future where the thin line between cars  hybrid flying cars  and aircrafts gets increasingly blurred  with the products being 100% electric. The big question to answer to unfold the revolution is one: who is the pilot?An AI-powered revolutionWhile it may seem farfetched now  I do not think imagining AI taking over piloting functions in a decade or so is too much of a technological leap. Indeed  I'd expect the biggest hurdle to overcome in realizing such a scenario will probably be developing the related legislation rather than the technology. Autonomous driving (on roads) is already just a few steps away  but legislation is still lagging.Potentially  here lie the advantages of AI-powered flying cars over ""normal"" ones. If the entire fleet had an AI pilot  there wouldn't be a need to regulate accidents between human-driven and AI-driven vehicles. Probably  road accidents could also become a thing of the past. DUI will not happen with AI. The change could happen much more quickly because while almost everyone has a driver's license and can drive a car just as well  not many people have a pilot's license to show for it.Even if autonomous driving has a slow adoption rate  it remains the first step toward an AI-driven future  and starting in 2024  Stellantis will begin deploying three all-new AI-powered technology platforms across its four global vehicle platforms:StellantisThe centerpiece of the new Stellantis platform is the STLA Brain. This service-oriented architecture is entirely cloud integrated and allows real-time delivery of features and services through OTA updates. The chosen partner in cloud computing for this always-connected feature is Amazon. The STLA brain will integrate with the AutoDrive feature  which enables advanced driver assistance (ADAS) today and will allow for autopilot driving soon.Stellantis has already tested the L3 autonomy level  driving nearly one million kilometers on public roads  and a broader roll-out of this autonomy level is scheduled for 2024. The next step is L4/L5 intelligent vehicles  for which the company is partnering with Waymo and BMW (OTCPK:BMWYY).The third and final element of the new tech-driven Stellantis is the SmartCockpit  developed in partnership with Foxconn (OTCPK:HNHAF). I rate the partnership choice again top-notch  considering their experience with smartphones. After all  the SmartCockpit will likely evolve into an advanced entertainment system that also syncs with our other tech gadgets once AI does all the driving.While waiting for AI-based piloting on flying cars  the SmartCockpit will use AI applications to deliver features and services such as navigation  voice assistance  e-commerce  and payment services. With all the moving parts coming together  I see how AI represents an opportunity for Stellantis here  and as a first step  it will help triple STLA service and software revenues by 2030.Long-term valuation modelsThe Dare Forward 2030 financial assumptions are probably a good start to assess the full return potential of an investment in Stellantis:StellantisI don't think expecting STLA to trade at 7x-8x its 2030 FCF is preposterous. Even if the current 5x multiple seems frankly too low  not many automakers manage to steadily command a premium  with Ford (F) and Toyota coming to mind. However  with 20% of 2030 sales coming from SAAS/subscription software-based services  these steady revenues would naturally command higher multiples than cyclical hardware sales. Thus  I don't think such a re-rating would be a stretch. Considering that STLA has a net cash position  the market cap would be at least €160B  a 3x return toward $55-$60 per share.In my SOTP model  I tried to break down the value of the various moving parts  but I maintained the top-line assumptions of the Dare Forward strategy. The first part is the traditional auto manufacturing part  which should grow at a 7% CAGR through 2030. With €234 billion in sales and approximately €14 billion in FCF  I value this business division at about 6.5x 2030 FCF or 0.4x P/S.The second moving part is the AI-enabled service division  which will grow at about 14% CAGR through the decade  eventually reaching €60 billion in revenues and almost €6 billion in free cash flow. I value this division at a modest 12x FCF or 1.15x sales and argue it will be worth about €70 billion.The third and final part is the Archer investment/eVTOL business I discussed earlier in the analysis. The eVTOL opportunity is an optionality on top of the Dare Forward plan  which could increase the total FCF by about €1 billion and STLA valuation by €12 billion based on a 10x FCF multiple.And Value For AllAccording to this model  total STLA P/S would move towards 0.58x and P/FCF to about 8x in light of the increased weight of services and aviation.The value per share would move towards €55.5 ($63) without even accounting for the share repurchase plans that STLA has been carrying  which I expect  at a minimum  to cancel out any effect of share dilution. Still  it could potentially propel total return even higher.The presented bull case for Stellantis implies that if everything goes well  investors could book annualized total returns through 2030 of 25%-30% as the sum of dividends (currently 8% yield)  growth (8%  in line with FCF growth as STLA will continue to pay out DPS as a fixed proportion of FCF to shareholders) and 10%-15% share price appreciation on top  coming from valuation multiple expansion and realignment to fair value. While this is a massive upside  it is far from devoid of risks.Downside risksI see substantial execution risks for STLA on its way to achieving €60 billion in revenues from services and software by 2030. While STLA already earns a decent amount from financing and AS services (under the ""services"" categories in the 2021 pie graph  representing 12% of the total)  the current software revenue is zero. Although heavy investments should eventually start to pay off  the company has a long way to go.Competition in the automotive space has always been fierce. For some context about how difficult it is to succeed in this industry: before becoming FCA  Fiat was a severely distressed business  and in 2004 the company was about to sell out to General Motors (GM). Fiat eventually became Chrysler's owner (and transformed into FCA Group) because the Detroit firm filed for Chapter 11. As already said  PSA Group  before Tavares  was also on the brink of bankruptcy.Incumbent ICE players who have survived the M&A frenzy have recently enjoyed several years of robust margins. However  a new wave of pure-EV competitors  led by the apparent frontrunner Tesla (TSLA)  has emerged and will again put incumbent players to the test. Stellantis owns several appealing brands  although it arguably lacks a leading brand with worldwide recognition. Even for STLA brands well positioned in both NA and Europe  like Jeep  these generally lack the depth of rivals  focusing on one market segment (e.g.  SUVs and Crossovers in Jeep's case). The company entered the post-merger phase with 14 brands  to which Tavares has pledged support for the rest of the decade:StellantisArguably  struggling brands  such as DS and Lancia  will have a hard time surviving beyond 2030. For others  like Chrysler and Vauxhall  they are also most likely a ""maybe."" [For more info about STLA brands and their long-term survivability chances  readers may find an interesting Reddit discussion here].In my opinion  the situation is not overly concerning but  at minimum  contributes to creating a sub-optimal situation in which marketing efforts are fragmented  must be geographically targeted  and can't be as effective globally as STLA's competitors.The forecast I presented expects overall sales volumes to increase by 2% annually through 2030. I set the bar relatively low and believe STLA could attain such growth without stealing market share from the competition. On the plus side  I think the correct execution and revamping of brands such as Maserati and Alfa Romeo could offer some upside. Conversely  an apparent threat is coming in the BEV space from brands such as Tesla that could dilute STLA's market share. There is also some risk in expecting pricing to firm up at a CAGR of 5%  especially with inflation cooling off  but with the increasing amount of technology incorporated into new vehicles  it is foreseeable that future car purchases could take up a slightly higher fraction of the households' budget. Regardless of its theoretical viability  a 7% CAGR scenario should be considered a bullish scenario that may not come to light. But here comes the beauty of this stock: even by stress-testing it with much more baseline assumptions  STLA still comes out as a decent investment:And Value For AllUnder this bearish scenario  I calculated volumes to fall by 1% and pricing to grow more in line with inflation  resulting in a sales CAGR through 2030 of only 2%. Service revenues only grow at a modest 6%. Considering the CAPEX to develop AI-powered services poured in by STLA to increase these numbers  that would be a disappointing result. Also  I reduced sales and valuation gains from the Archer ownership stake by 1/3.Still  even after all these negative adjustments  I can see a path for Stellantis to return an annualized 10.5% to buy and hold investors from its 8% dividend yield and 2.5% FCF CAGR  and that still disregards any capital gains from a sale. However  the share price could almost double from €16.6 to €32.8.ConclusionsDespite the challenges  Stellantis is an incredible cash machine today. The company has one of the best margins in automotive and has a solid balance sheet with negative net debt  yet trades at extremely cheap multiples despite the obvious positives.I like the investment case here a great deal and assign a ""Strong Buy"" rating to STLA shares. While the short-term target could be €25  I am more interested in this company's long-term attractive total return potential. Even if the company achieves mediocre results  trims some brands  and grows mainly through pricing  shareholders should see attractive returns from the high dividend yield and modest free cash flow growth. STLA shares are cheap and unloved today  arguably because the company lacks a global brand in its portfolio capable of catalyzing attention. Nevertheless  most of Stellantis' brands are quite attractive at a regional level  plus some long shots that still have a fan base among motor enthusiasts could see a comeback.The significant upside comes from Stellantis' focus on transforming itself into a mobility tech company and the €60 billion revenues from services it envisioned in its 2030 strategic plan. If STLA successfully transitions to this new growth phase  I believe there could be ""blue skies ahead."" This reasoning comes from my belief that  in the 2030-2040 decade  AI and eVTOL will likely fuel the ""real"" revolution in e-mobility. I expect AI-piloted eVTOL technologies to rapidly mature and become available for the upper middle class (probably the top 10% of earners). Stellantis seems to be playing chess with the competition playing checkers  pushing ahead with smart investment decisions  and enjoying a significant first-mover advantage when the time comes.If that goes as planned  STLA shares could really take off by then.Editor's Note: This article was submitted as part of Seeking Alpha's Best AI Ideas investment competition  which runs through August 15.

SERCAN OZKURNAZLI / APOn Monday  July 17  Russia announced the suspension of the Ukrainian grain export agreement. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov announced without further details that the agreement  which has allowed the export of 33 million tons of grain since July 2022  would be operational again ""when the part on the Black Sea concerning Russia is implemented."" This suspension should have little impact in the immediate term  when the northern hemisphere is harvesting  but will inevitably create tensions and inflation in the medium term.Little immediate impactThe situation is very different from that of the end of February 2022  when Russia invaded Ukraine  closing the Black Sea to shipping – Ukraine's main export route for agricultural products. At the time  Ukraine was the world's leading exporter of sunflower oil and the fourth biggest exporter of wheat and corn.The opening of the corridor on August 1  2022  brought relief to importing countries  particularly in the Mediterranean and Africa  bringing down world prices  which had reached unprecedented levels in May.In two years  Ukraine has seen its grain production almost halved  with forecasts of 25 million metric tons of corn and 17.5 million metric tons of wheat for 2023-2024  compared with 42 million metric tons of corn and 33 million metric tons of wheat in 2021-2022  according to the latest report from the US Department of Agriculture. ""In 2023-2024  it is expected to export 6 million metric tons less wheat and 10 million metric tons less corn than in the previous season "" reported Gautier Le Molgat  an analyst at Agritel.Harvesting wheat in the Kharkiv region  July 22  2020. STRINGER / REUTERSThe situation is less tense  because there is less product to export and because the northern hemisphere is in the middle of the harvest. ""Future needs will become clearer at the end of the harvest. It's a calm period on the markets  which have reacted very little to the suspension of the agreement "" with the price of wheat rising by less than 1% on Euronext  as Le Molgat noted.What's more  in recent months  ""there has been a bottleneck in the Bosphorus  with very slow traffic "" due in particular to fewer Russian inspections of ships using the corridor  Edward de Saint-Denis  a broker at Plantureux & Associés  commented.The limits of the land-based alternativeEven before the corridor was opened  the European Union set up solidarity lanes  land and river corridors designed to facilitate Ukrainian exports across Europe. The Farm Foundation  a think-tank on global agricultural issues  estimates that half of Ukrainian exports currently go through these routes  notably via Poland and Romania. ""One of the questions is whether the EU  which has recovered 50% of Ukraine's grain supply since the start of the conflict  has the capacity to re-export these volumes "" Olia Tayeb Cherif  head of research at Farm  observed.The EU would like to improve overland supply  notably with a project to harmonize rail gauges at the borders between the European Union and Ukraine  but this will take time. ""We'll be able to increase the rate a little  but we won't solve the problem for the volumes involved "" said de Saint-Denis.Read more Article réservé à nos abonnés The Central European countries closing their borders to agricultural products from UkraineMedium-term concernsCurrently  the world has no shortage of wheat. But  as Damien Vercambre of Inter-Courtage pointed out  ""the bulk of exportable wheat is in Russia  with around 12.5 million metric tons of stocks  and it's the cheapest wheat in the world.""Russia could make up at least part of the Ukrainian shortfall  as could the EU  with what looks set to be a very good harvest. But this would accelerate third-country dependence on Moscow and would be difficult to manage in the event of a major climatic accident.It's important to differentiate between corn and wheat. China  by far the biggest beneficiary of the maritime corn corridor  will be able to turn to Brazil  which is currently selling at a lower price and has a record harvest.The situation is more complex for wheat. If volumes are available  importing countries can be supplied  but at what price? ""A lasting closure of the corridor will have an impact on food prices  which will affect food security "" warned Farm's Olia Tayeb Cherif. Some countries  such as Egypt recently  are already finding it difficult to meet payments for certain tenders.Moreover  food aid itself could be undermined  as ""Ukraine is a supplier to the World Food Program: around 8% of Ukrainian wheat exports have gone to the WFP  destined for countries such as Yemen  Afghanistan and the Horn of Africa "" Cherif pointed out.Read more Article réservé à nos abonnés The fertilizer market's dependence on Russia puts grain production at risk",neutral,0.0,0.92,0.08,mixed,0.24,0.14,0.62,True,English,"['Ukrainian grain', 'effect', 'suspension', 'agreement', 'exports', '10 million metric tons less corn', 'Bulk grain cargo ship', 'The Central European countries', 'Ukrainian grain export agreement', '25 million metric tons', '17.5 million metric tons', '42 million metric tons', '33 million metric tons', '6 million metric tons', '12.5 million metric tons', 'fewer Russian inspections', 'major climatic accident', 'main export route', 'global agricultural issues', 'Olia Tayeb Cherif', 'fourth biggest exporter', 'Gautier Le Molgat', 'The Farm Foundation', 'Little immediate impact', 'Edward de Saint-Denis', 'World Food Program', 'Ukrainian wheat exports', 'maritime corn corridor', '33 million tons', 'Ukrainian exports', 'European Union', 'Ukrainian shortfall', 'little impact', 'immediate term', 'leading exporter', 'grain production', 'less product', 'grain supply', 'biggest beneficiary', 'agricultural products', 'food prices', 'food security', 'food aid', 'TQ Samsun', 'Black Sea', 'SERCAN OZKURNAZLI', 'Kremlin spokesperson', 'Dmitry Peskov', 'northern hemisphere', 'medium term', 'sunflower oil', 'importing countries', 'unprecedented levels', 'two years', 'latest report', 'US Department', 'less wheat', 'previous season', 'Kharkiv region', 'Future needs', 'calm period', 'recent months', 'slow traffic', 'Associés', 'land-based alternative', 'solidarity lanes', 'river corridors', 'overland supply', 'rail gauges', 'Medium-term concerns', 'Damien Vercambre', 'lasting closure', 'fertilizer market', 'world prices', 'Bosphorus Strait', 'Harvesting wheat', 'exportable wheat', 'cheapest wheat', 'good harvest', 'third-country dependence', 'record harvest', 'lower price', 'entrance', 'Istanbul', 'Turkey', 'Monday', 'July', 'suspension', 'details', 'tensions', 'inflation', 'situation', 'February', 'Ukraine', 'opening', 'August', 'relief', 'Mediterranean', 'Africa', 'May', 'forecasts', 'Agriculture', 'analyst', 'Agritel', 'STRINGER', 'REUTERS', 'middle', 'markets', 'Euronext', 'bottleneck', 'ships', 'broker', 'Plantureux', 'limits', 'think-tank', 'half', 'routes', 'Poland', 'Romania', 'questions', 'start', 'conflict', 'capacity', 'volumes', 'head', 'research', 'project', 'borders', 'rate', 'problem', 'Article', 'shortage', 'Inter-Courtage', 'stocks', 'Moscow', 'event', 'China', 'Brazil', 'Egypt', 'payments', 'tenders', 'supplier', 'WFP', 'Yemen', 'Afghanistan', 'Horn', 'risk']",2023-07-18,2023-07-18,lemonde.fr
