The protocol is designed to serve and facilitate cross-chain transactions across a number of blockchains currently operating from within and alongside the Ethereum and EVM ecosystems.Notably  this innovative protocol is now live on several major blockchain platforms  namely Avalanche  Ethereum  Optimism  and Polygon.The integration of this service has already stimulated the market  evidenced by the near 10% uptick in the price of Chainlink's native token  LINK  which soared to a high of $7.30 in the wake of the announcement.Boosting Blockchain Connectivity with CCIPEarlier this week  Chainlink's official blog post unveiled the CCIP's early access availability on multiple blockchain platforms. This development not only enhances the potential for interconnectivity among various blockchain ecosystems but also empowers developers by providing a robust platform to create custom cross-chain solutions.A key advantage that the CCIP brings to the table is its ""Simplified Token Transfers"" feature. This functionality empowers protocols to expedite the process of sending tokens across chains  all under the assurance of audited token pool contracts.This cross-chain protocol is a collaborative undertaking involving Swift  the esteemed global financial messaging network. The CCIP leverages Swift's advanced messaging infrastructure  facilitating seamless token transfers across an array of public and private blockchains.Key Elements of The ProtocolThe Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) has been designed to cater to developers' needs by providing them with flexible tools to create custom cross-chain solutions. An example of this is its Arbitrary Messaging feature  which opens up the possibility for unique cross-chain applications. Additionally  Simplified Token Transfers  which utilize audited token pool contracts  streamline the process of moving tokens across chains. This feature saves development time by eliminating the need for writing custom code.A key element of CCIP's implementation strategy is its collaboration with established financial messaging network Swift (stylized in some cases as SWIFT)  along with several financial institutions. This collaboration focuses on utilizing existing messaging infrastructures to facilitate token transfers across diverse blockchain environments.By enabling traditional finance to connect with decentralized networks  this innovative approach lays a foundation for a new phase of collaborative advancement between these two sectors. The integration of CCIP into multiple major blockchains marks a significant stride in improving blockchain interoperability  fostering greater connectivity  and utility in decentralized networks. Chainlink is also partnered with Coinbase Cloud  which is designated as a node operator.Chainlink's co-founder  Sergey Nazarov  pointed out that the CCIP serves in such a way that it [functions to]:""connect the fragmented public blockchain landscape and the growing bank ecosystem into a single Internet of Contracts.""Nazarov further emphasized that such a technological advancement would be vital in shaping and sustaining a society powered by blockchain.Various prominent financial institutions and enterprises  including the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ)  BNP Paribas  BNY Mellon  Citi  Euroclear  and Lloyds Banking Group  are currently exploring the possibilities and benefits presented by the CCIP.Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

This patent application submission is a precondition for a pre-IND application with the FDA in the United States1 and a commitment to extending this new patent applicationinternationally.Patent application filed in the United States for the formulation of NFL-301 and commitment to extend it internationallyNFL Biosciences is continuing to move forward with its intellectual property strategy with the filing of a first patent for NFL-301. It aims to protect prolonged-release formulations of extracts of kudzu  a plant used in traditional Chinese medicine  as well as their uses for the treatment of alcohol consumption reduction.Under the co-development agreement set up at the start of 2022  NFL Biosciences and its industrial partner ATHENA Pharmaceutiques have developed a prolonged-release form of kudzu extracts in microgranule form  NFL-301.NFL Biosciences aims to develop the first oral delivery drug based on kudzu extracts to tackle excessive alcohol consumption. NFL-301 will stand out from kudzu-based nutritional supplements through:its positioning as a drug that is compliant with marketing authorization (MA) regulations;its dosage that is higher and in line with the expected efficacy range in the countries that limit daily concentrations as a nutritional supplement (e.g. France  Belgium and other European countries);its quality  controlled in accordance with good manufacturing practices (GMP);its prolonged effect enabling a single daily dose;its flexibility for taking and adapting dosage levels thanks to the microgranule form  compared with capsules or tablets.Preparation of a pre-IND application in the United States for NFL-301NFL is preparing a pre-IND application in the United States  which is expected to be submitted in September  with a view to obtaining FDA approval for the manufacturing process  product quality and development strategy through to MA.This project is being carried out working with Prof. Scott Lukas  Director of the Behavioral Psychopharmacology Research Laboratory and the McLean Hospital Imaging Center at Harvard Medical School in Boston  who is a world-renowned addiction research specialist and has led recent clinical trials covering the effect of the administration of kudzu extracts in terms of reducing alcohol consumption: “I am delighted with NFL Biosciences’ development of a prolonged-release form of pharmaceutical grade kudzu extract. We had reached the clinical development limits with the traditional forms. This formulation should enable us to continue developing this potentially disruptive treatment  because  to date  it has been very well tolerated  free from side-effects and effective”.Bruno Lafont  Chief Operating Officer leading the scientific development of the Company’s projects: “We would like to sincerely thank Athena Pharmaceutiques for the development of this formulation  which is the result of 18 months of work  as well as Ipsilon and Francis Ahner  a member of our Board of Directors and global intellectual property expert  for the preparation of this patent application. The clear commitment that we set out when we listed on the stock market to develop a second drug candidate in addition to NFL-101 is gradually being confirmed and it is expected that further progress will be established by the end of the year”.About NFL BiosciencesNFL Biosciences is a biopharmaceutical company based in the Montpellier area which develops botanical drug candidates for the treatment of addictions.

As the auto industry’s demand for semiconductors accelerates  Stellantis is implementing a multifaceted strategy designed to manage and secure the long-term supply of vital microchips. Developed by a cross-functional team  the strategy was created through a rigorous assessment of customer desires for advanced technology features and a keen focus on delivering the objectives laid out in the Stellantis Dare Forward 2030 plan.The robust strategy  which is refined continuously  includes:implementation of a semiconductor database to provide full transparency on the semiconductor content;systematic risk assessment to avoid and proactively remove legacy parts;long-term chip level demand forecasting to support capacity securitization agreements with chip makers and Silicon Foundries;implementation and enforcement of a Green List to reduce chip diversity and – in case of future chip shortages – to put Stellantis in control of the allocation; and the purchasing of mission-critical parts at chip makers including a long-term securitization of chip supply.Stellantis has started to engage with strategic semiconductor providers like Infineon  NXP® Semiconductors  onsemi  and Qualcomm to further improve its all-new  state-of-the-art STLA platforms and technologies. In addition  Stellantis is working with aiMotive and SiliconAuto to develop its own differentiating semiconductors in the future.“An effective semiconductor strategy requires a deep understanding of semiconductors and the semiconductor industry ” said Maxime Picat  Chief Purchasing and Supply Chain Officer at Stellantis. “We have hundreds of very different semiconductors in our cars. We have built a comprehensive ecosystem to mitigate the risk that one missing chip can stop our lines. At the same time  key vehicle capabilities directly depend on the innovation and performance of single devices. SiC MOSFETS extend the range of our electric vehicles while the computation performance of a leading-edge SoC is essential for the customer experience and safety.”To date  Stellantis has entered into direct agreements for semiconductors with a purchasing value of more than €10 billion through 2030. The supply agreements cover a variety of vital microchips  including:Silicon Carbide (SiC) MOSFETS  which are fundamental to the range of EVs.Microcontroller Unit (MCU)  a key part of the computing zones for the STLA Brain electrical architecture.System-on-a-chip (SoC)  where performance is essential for the high-performance computing (HPC) units that deliver the in-vehicle infotainment and autonomous driving assist functions.Semiconductors play key roles in the vehicles that are driving the Stellantis transformation into a sustainable mobility tech company  as outlined in Dare Forward 2030. This includes enabling features and functions in the BEV-native STLA global platforms (Small/Medium/Large/Frame) and the seamless connectivity  remote upgradability  and the flexible service-oriented electrical/electronic architecture that underpins the STLA Brain  STLA SmartCockpit  and STLA AutoDrive artificial intelligence-powered platforms.# # #About StellantisStellantis N.V.

The good momentum in Europe (+7.0%) and Asia-Pacific (+4.5%) fully offset the weak performance of the Latin America zone (-11%) penalized mainly by Chile. In Europe  our growth for the quarter was notably driven by France  where activity rebounded strongly (+21.6%) after a first quarter in decline. To a lesser extent  the region's growth was also driven by the United Kingdom  Southern Europe and benefited from the impact of the acquisition of our distributor in the Czech Republic (around €1 million). In Asia-Pacific  all of the sub-zones are progressing  excluding India and China  which performance remains stable compared to 2022. Finally  the activity of our subsidiary in North America is slightly growing by +0.4%.

In Asia-Pacific (+1.9% at constant rates)  our products for farm animals continue to fuel our growth in Australia and New Zealand  while our activity in India remains relatively stable compared to 2022. Sales in China were down  penalized by weak sales in the first quarter. The Latin America zone is declining (-6.8% at constant rates)  penalized by the significant drop in activity of our subsidiary in Chile (-32% at constant rates) in particular on the antibiotic and parasiticide ranges. Excluding Chile and at constant exchange rates  the change in activity is positive at +3.5%  supported by Mexico  Brazil and the countries of Central America  despite the decline in dogs and cats vaccines’ sales.

July 18  2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Advent Therapeutics  Inc.  a biotechnology company pioneering an optimized retinol palmitate (vitamin A) drug product as a breakthrough non-invasive inhaled neonatal lung therapy  has been awarded a $3 million National Institutes of Health (NIH) Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase IIB grant. This grant allows the Company to position its novel aerosolized vitamin A formulation for commercialization in 2025 to prevent Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD). BPD is a rare disease and the most common serious complication facing premature infants  resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. There are currently no approved therapies. With this grant  the Company has now received in excess of $6 million from NIH for its neonatal programs.“This NIH award will allow us to greatly accelerate the development and advance towards approval of our optimized vitamin A drug product ” commented David L. Lopez  Chief Executive Officer  Advent Therapeutics. “Advent’s novel  precisely optimized products are intended to address the unmet medical need of BPD facing premature infants and reduce morbidity and mortality in this fragile patient population. Our primary focus is to accelerate the path to commercialization  first in the US  then EU and worldwide. US launch of Advent’s initial vitamin A drug product for injection is possible in early 2025 with potential peak annual revenues in excess of $100 million for the prevention of BPD. In addition  we intend to pursue broader applications for our novel retinol palmitate drug product that have significant market potential.”This SBIR Phase IIB grant  awarded under the auspices of both the National Heart  Lung  and Blood Institute (NHLBI) and National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS)  will support development of Advent’s proprietary aerosolized formulation of vitamin A. The $3 million provided under the SBIR Phase IIB grant will be used to complete preclinical requirements and manufacturing scale-up leading to pivotal human clinical trials with Advent’s inhalable retinol palmitate product to potentially gain US and other worldwide marketing approvals.Dr. Virender Rehan  Advent’s Principal Investigator at the Lundquist Institute  Professor of Pediatrics  David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA  Chief of the Division of Neonatology  and Director of the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit  Harbor-UCLA Medical Center  said  “BPD is the most frequent serious complication that affects roughly 15 000 infants annually in the US  with an even greater number of premature infants at risk. With no approved drugs for BPD  these fragile  at-risk premature infants require prolonged mechanical ventilation or oxygen support and lengthy hospital stays often resulting in recurring hospitalizations and pulmonary infections. A baby with BPD adds significant emotional constraints for the family and financial burden to the healthcare system.”Advent has longstanding collaborations with Dr. Rehan and the world-renowned Lundquist Institute for Biomedical Innovation. The Lundquist Institute is one of the foremost independent  non-profit research institutes in the US and is partnered with Harbor-UCLA Medical Center.Dr. Virender continued  “I am extremely pleased to be involved in developing Advent’s novel form of inhalable vitamin A therapy. This product has the potential to be a “first-in-class” therapy capable of non-invasively delivering a safe and effective aerosolized vitamin A dose directly to the neonate’s lung. A lung-targeted inhalation therapy that could effectively reduce development of BPD would have significant clinical  financial  and societal implications by directly addressing co-morbidities suffered by these fragile patients.”Advent has previously been awarded Orphan Drug Designation in both US and Europe for its proprietary vitamin A formulation. Orphan Drug Designation provides incentives including assistance with drug development process and exemption from user fees  as well as a seven-year window of exclusive US marketing rights (10 years in Europe) following marketing approval.ABOUT BRONCHOPULMONARY DYSPLASIA (BPD)BPD is a rare disease and the most common serious complication facing premature infants  resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. It is an extremely costly respiratory disorder afflicting premature infants for which there is currently no approved drugs worldwide. Annually  in both US and Europe  there are approximately 100 000 premature infants at-risk for BPD and many more in Asia-Pacific  Latin America and throughout the world. Hospital costs in the US for treating a BPD infant in the first year are approximately $442 000 with an average first year hospital stay of 103 days. US healthcare costs of treating babies with BPD have been estimated as $2.4 billion per year.NOVEL VITAMIN A DRUG PRODUCT MANUFACTURINGAdvent is completing manufacturing scale-up of its proprietary optimized retinol palmitate drug product at Pace® Analytical Life Sciences. Commercial product for administration by injection is expected by 4Q 2024. Pace is a highly regarded contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) with facilities throughout the US  including San Diego  CA  where Advent’s manufacturing scale-up is being completed  and Salem  NH  where commercial batches will be produced.

(Advent) was founded by senior industry executives with extensive expertise and proven track records in developing products in respiratory diseases for neonatal  pediatric and similar Orphan Drug “niche” markets and therapies. Advent is committed to developing life-changing medicines for the most-fragile preterm infants and is focusing on novel approaches to addressing serious unmet medical needs facing this significantly underserved Orphan Drug patient population. Advent has developed a proprietary formulation of optimized retinol palmitate (vitamin A) specifically designed for dosing to preterm infants to address vitamin A deficiency and associated serious complications of prematurity such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)  retinopathy of prematurity (ROP)  and neonatal sepsis  all significantly impacting both short- and long-term clinical outcomes. The Company is also pursuing the potential of inhaled optimized retinol palmitate to mitigate acute lung injury (ALI) and address CBRN (chemical  biological  and radio-nuclear) threat agents  and pulmonary infections (bacterial  influenza  SARS-CoV-2)  which often progress to life-threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). These represent large therapeutic opportunities for which Advent expects to partner with others for development and commercialization.

If approved  this would represent the fourth indication for bimekizumab in the European Union across a range of IL-17 mediated diseases "" said Emmanuel Caeymaex  Executive Vice President  Immunology Solutions and Head of U.S.  UCB.The application for HS is supported by data from the Phase 3 BE HEARD I and BE HEARD II studies which were previously communicated.1 In both studies  bimekizumab demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements over placebo in signs and symptoms of HS at week 16  as measured by HiSCR50  the primary endpoint in the two studies  with maintained response to Week 48.1* Patients treated with bimekizumab also achieved deep levels of clinical response with a greater proportion achieving HiSCR75  a key secondary endpoint  at week 16 than placebo.1 The safety profile of bimekizumab across BE HEARD I and BE HEARD II was consistent with previous bimekizumab studies with no new safety signals observed.1In August 2021  bimekizumab▼ first received marketing authorization in countries of the European Union (EU)/European Economic Area (EEA) for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy.2 In June 2023  bimekizumab was approved in countries of the EU/EEA for the treatment of adults with active psoriatic arthritis  and for the treatment of adults with active axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA)  including non-radiographic axSpA and ankylosing spondylitis  also known as radiographic axSpA.2The safety and efficacy of bimekizumab in HS have not been established  and it is not approved for use in HS by any regulatory authority worldwide.Notes to editors:*p=0.006 and p=0.003 for BE HEARD I and BE HEARD II  respectively with bimekizumab every two weeks (Q2W); p=0.030 and p=0.004 for BE HEARD I and BE HEARD II  respectively with bimekizumab every four weeks (Q4W).About Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS)Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic  recurring  painful  and debilitating inflammatory skin disease  that is associated with systemic manifestations.3 4 The main symptoms are nodules  abscesses  and pus-discharging fistulas (channels leading out of the skin) which typically occur in the armpits  groin and buttocks.3 4 People with HS experience flare-ups of the disease as well as severe pain  which can have a major impact on quality of life.3 4HS develops in early adulthood  affects approximately one percent of the population in most studied countries.3 4 Approximately one third of people with HS have a family history of HS  and lifestyle factors such as smoking and obesity can also play a crucial role in the clinical course of HS.5The symptoms of pain  discharge and scarring are not only a physical burden. People with HS also experience stigma: worrying about or directly experiencing negative attitudes and reactions from society in response to their symptoms.6 These feelings can lead to embarrassment  social isolation  low self-esteem and sexual life impairment  and impact all areas of life  including interpersonal relationships  education and work.3 5About BE HEARD I and BE HEARD IIBE HEARD I is a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled  parallel group  multicenter  Phase 3 study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab in adults with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (HS).7 BE HEARD II is a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled  parallel group  multicenter  Phase 3 study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab in adults with moderate to severe HS.8 The two studies had a combined enrolment of 1 014 participants with a diagnosis of moderate to severe HS.7 8 The primary endpoint in both studies was HiSCR50 at week 16.8 A key secondary endpoint was HiSCR75 at week 16. HiSCR50 and HiSCR75 are defined as at least either a 50 or 75 percent reduction from baseline in the total abscess and inflammatory nodule count  with no increase from baseline in abscess or draining tunnel count.7 8 The two studies evaluated two dose regimens of bimekizumab (320 mg every two weeks [Q2W] and 320 mg every four weeks [Q4W]) versus placebo over the 16-week initial and the 32-week maintenance treatment periods.7 8About bimekizumabBimekizumab is a humanized monoclonal IgG1 antibody that is designed to selectively inhibit both interleukin 17A (IL-17A) and interleukin 17F (IL-17F)  two key cytokines driving inflammatory processes.9 The therapeutic indications in the European Union are:Plaque psoriasis : Bimekizumab is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy. 2Psoriatic arthritis : Bimekizumab is indicated alone or in combination with methotrexate  for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis in adults who have had an inadequate response or who have been intolerant to one or more disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). 2Axial Spondyloarthritis: Bimekizumab is indicated for the treatment of adults with active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis with objective signs of inflammation as indicated by elevated C-reactive protein (CRP)  and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) who have responded inadequately or are intolerant to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)  and for the treatment of adults with active ankylosing spondylitis who have responded inadequately or are intolerant to conventional therapy.2BIMZELX®▼(bimekizumab) EU/EEA* Important Safety InformationThe most frequently reported adverse reactions with bimekizumab were upper respiratory tract infections (14.5%  14.6%  16.3% in plaque psoriasis (PSO)  psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA)  respectively) and oral candidiasis (7.3%  2.3%  3.7% in PSO  PsA and axSpA  respectively). Common adverse reactions (≥1/100 to <1/10) were oral candidiasis  tinea infections  ear infections  herpes simplex infections  oropharyngeal candidiasis  gastroenteritis  folliculitis  headache  rash  dermatitis and eczema  acne  injection site reactions  fatigue. Elderly may be more likely to experience certain adverse reactions such as oral candidiasis  dermatitis and eczema when using bimekizumab.Bimekizumab is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the excipients and in patients with clinically important active infections (e.g. active tuberculosis).Bimekizumab may increase the risk of infections. Treatment with bimekizumab must not be initiated in patients with any clinically important active infection. Patients treated with bimekizumab should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms suggestive of an infection occur. If a patient develops an infection the patient should be carefully monitored. If the infection becomes serious or is not responding to standard therapy  treatment should be discontinued until the infection resolves. Prior to initiating treatment with bimekizumab  patients should be evaluated for tuberculosis (TB) infection. Bimekizumab should not be given in patients with active TB. Patients receiving bimekizumab should be monitored for signs and symptoms of active TB.Cases of new or exacerbations of inflammatory bowel disease have been reported with bimekizumab. Bimekizumab is not recommended in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. If a patient develops signs and symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease or experiences an exacerbation of pre-existing inflammatory bowel disease  bimekizumab should be discontinued and appropriate medical management should be initiated. Serious hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions have been observed with IL-17 inhibitors. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs  administration of bimekizumab should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated.Live vaccines should not be given in patients treated with bimekizumab.Please consult the summary of product characteristics in relation to other side effects  full safety and prescribing information.European SmPC date of revision: June 2023.http://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/product-information/bimzelx-epar-product-information_en.pdf*EU/EEA means European Union/European Economic Area▼ This medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring.

The transaction had no significant effect on SATO Corporation’s result.Despite the challenging competitive situation  SATO has succeeded in improving the occupancy rate.Summary for 1 April to 30 June 2023 (1 April to 30 June 2022)The economic occupancy rate was 95 . 0 % (95.0).Net sales totalled EUR 71 . 5 million (72.5).Net rental income was EUR 52 . 5 million ( 54.0 ).Profit before taxes was EUR -69 . 1 million (37.6).The unrealised change in the fair value of investment properties included in the result was EUR -75 . 1 million ( -42 . 3 ).Housing investments amounted to EUR 46 . 5 million (44.7).Earnings per share were EUR -1 . 05 (0.54).A total of 513 (191) rental apartments were acquired or completed.A total of 679 new rental apartments (1 001)  0 owner-occupied homes (0) and 0 FlexHomes (52) are under construction.In April 118 and in June 104 SATO rental homes were completed in Veräjämäki  Oulunkylä  Helsinki. In April 132 rental homes were completed in Hervantajärvi  Tampere  and in June 159 rental homes were completed in Keimolanmäki  Vantaa. Following full renovation  95 rental homes were completed in Kallio  Helsinki  and 30 rental homes were completed in Etelä-Haaga  Helsinki.President and CEO Antti Aarnio:- During the period under review  SATO’s occupancy rate improved and was 95.0% (94.8). After the coronavirus pandemic  demand for SATO rental homes has been picking up since spring 2022 and there is demand for rental homes in growth centres. Spurred by the war in Ukraine  the economic uncertainty and higher consumer prices and interest rates are also in part reflected in the rising demand for rental homes.- There has been a significant decline in the volume of new housing construction projects commenced  but previously started projects will still result in a large number of new homes being completed this year  maintaining intense competition for good tenants. Due to the competitive situation  it has not been possible to transfer the higher maintenance and interest rate costs in full to apartment rents  but the increase in demand  higher costs and  on the other hand  a significant decline in new construction may result in higher rents in the future.- As the level of inflation and interest rates appears to be staying higher than was anticipated  there may be upward pressure on the return requirement for real property. Going forward  this may affect the fair value of investment assets.- A large number of rental apartments were completed during the 1 April to 30 June 2023 review period: in April 118 and in June 104 SATO homes were completed in Veräjämäki  Helsinki  in April 132 homes in Hervantajärvi  Tampere  and in June 159 homes were completed in Keimolanmäki  Vantaa. Following full renovation  95 rental homes were completed in Kallio  Helsinki  and 30 in Etelä-Haaga  Helsinki  both in June.- This year will see the completion of a total of 978 SATO rental homes. The industry-wide volume of new construction projects commenced is  however  at a historically low level  and the supply of new rental homes will decrease over the years ahead. The full renovation of a total of 545 SATO homes will be completed this year.- We completed the divestment of our housing business in Russia on 14 April 2023. SATO had operated in St Petersburg since 2007 and owned 522 rental apartments. Following the transaction  SATO no longer has operations in Russia. The transaction had no significant effect on SATO Corporation’s result.- SATO is strongly invested in increasing its presence close to customers and in digital services. During the first half of this year  we continued to build a consistent and seamless customer service experience. We have developed and reformed our digital operating environment and our operational information systems that enable us to operate more efficiently and serve our customers even better at any time of the day.- In April  we outsourced SATO’s rent payments process to Ropo Capital Oy  which is now responsible for functions including sending our rent invoices  processing payments and customer service relating to payments.- Director for Marketing and Communications at SATO since 2020  Laura Laamanen  MA  was appointed Chief Commercial Officer and member of the Corporate Management Group effective 11 May 2023.- I would like to thank SATO employees for their great work to develop customer satisfaction and the housing comfort of our residents.Operating environmentOver the reporting period  SATO’s operating environment was affected especially by inflation and the continued high level of rental housing supply. Inflation has remained high despite the price pressure having become more moderate after the winter months thanks to lower energy prices in particular. Core inflation has  however  persisted at a high level and clearly above the two per cent target of the central banks. The European Central Bank still continued to hike rates in June. The market expects the interest rate hikes to still continue in July. Inflation is projected to slow to below two per cent in 2024.The persistently high inflation has weakened consumers’ purchasing power  but the good employment situation has maintained service sector demand and stimulated the economy. Due to the increased interest rates  Finland will likely drift into a mild recession this year  and GDP is projected to grow by approximately one per cent in 2024 thanks to slower inflation and higher income growth.The economic uncertainty  persistently high interest rate level and increases in living costs have affected the number of housing transactions. In 2023  transaction volumes of both new and old homes have been exceptionally low  which has had a strong impact on the number of housing construction projects commenced. The Confederation of Finnish Construction Industries RT forecast of 29 March projects that the volume of new housing construction will decline by almost a third this year to around 27 000 homes. According to a housing production survey published on 1 June  the number of new housing construction projects started will be clearly lower than that anticipated in March. Projects started in 2021 and in early 2022 will still maintain the supply of new homes at a high level in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area throughout 2023  which means competition for good tenants will be intense and rent increases moderate. Higher maintenance costs will be reflected in more substantial rent increases in the future.With the good employment situation continuing  migration to large growth centres has continued and Helsinki region’s migration gain in 2022 was 17 420 people. This is reflected in the demand for rental homes in growth centres. The economic uncertainty and the climbing home loan interest rates coupled with increasing energy and other costs may also contribute towards growth in demand for rental housing. Some of those looking for a home to buy are now also considering a rental home as an option.The urbanisation trend continues and dense urban housing is becoming increasingly popular in Finland. There is demand for rental homes in growth centres close to good public transport connections and services. The Helsinki Metropolitan Area (HMA)  Tampere and Turku continue to enjoy strong growth  while at the same time Statistics Finland forecasts a downturn in the nationwide population trend in 2031. The HMA is projected to grow by more than 200 000 new residents by 2040. Almost 80% of HMA residents already live in households with one to two members  and the number of small households continues to grow. The proportion of immigrants is projected to increase in the HMA from the current 17% to 25% by 2030. The ageing population is moving to growth centres providing access to services and expects more and more housing-related services. The demographic change and the price development of owner-occupied homes create a stable foundation for rental housing demand  especially in the HMA  Tampere and Turku.REVIEW PERIOD 1 JANUARY TO 30 JUNE 2023 (1 JANUARY TO 30 JUNE 2022)Net sales and profitIn January–June 2023  SATO Corporation’s consolidated net sales totalled EUR 142.4 million (147.2).Operating profit was EUR -68.6 million (166.8).

The main risks of SATO’s business are risks related to the business environment and financial risks.The war in Ukraine is a short-term risk affecting the operating environment  the duration and impacts of which on the Finnish economy are difficult to estimate. The war’s biggest impacts have been seen in the prices of energy  food and materials as well as in supply chains. The surge in prices has resulted in a rapid increase in the interest rate level. The increase in price level may slow economic growth  continue to considerably increase the interest rate level  and have a negative effect on the purchasing power of consumers as well as on their capacity to perform their obligations. Such a decline in the economy or economic activity may have an adverse effect on the financial performance or activities  finance costs or value of SATO-owned properties.The highest risks in apartment rental are to do with cyclical movements and changes in supply and demand. The market risk may push the supply of rental homes higher than their demand. This would result in idle rental housing stock and pressure for rents to level off or fall  especially as regards old housing stock.A decline in the housing market may have a negative effect on the market value of SATO’s housing stock. In line with its strategy  SATO has been focusing in its investments on growth centres and on renovating and repairing existing housing stock and  consequently  ensuring the rentability and value development of the apartments.Changes in regulation by the authorities and in legislation and related uncertainty may have a significant impact on the reliability of the investment environment and  consequently  on SATO’s business. SATO monitors and anticipates these changes and also calls attention to what it considers to be negative impacts of regulation.The management of financial risks is steered by the Group’s treasury policy. Our risk management principles have been defined in the treasury policy adopted by SATO’s Board of Directors. Our most significant financial risks relate to liquidity  refinancing and interest rates. We manage our liquidity and refinancing risks by diversifying the financing sources and maturity of our loan portfolio  and by holding sufficient liquidity reserves in the form of committed credit facilities and other financing commitments. The company has in place an EUR 2.0 billion Euro Medium Term Notes (EMTN) Programme  under which SATO has issued bonds in the total amount of EUR 750.0 million.The means for managing liquidity risk at SATO include cash assets  a bank account limit  EUR 700.0 million in committed credit facilities and a EUR 400.0 million commercial paper programme. We increase the amount of reserves as the funding requirements grow. Our objective is to keep the liquidity requirements of the next 12 months covered by committed agreements.Floating rate loans represent an interest rate risk which we manage by balancing the share of fixed and floating rate loans either by fixed rate debt arrangements or interest rate derivatives. In accordance with our treasury policy  our aim is for fixed-rate loans  including interest rate derivatives  to account for more than 60% of our debt portfolio. At the end of the review period  the fixed rate portion of the loan portfolio after hedging was 62.9% (excluding short-term loans).For a broader description of risks and risk management  see the Group’s website and Annual Report for 2022 at www.sato.fi/en.OutlookIn the operating environment  SATO’s business activities are mainly affected by consumer confidence  development of purchasing power  rent and price development for apartments  competitive situation and interest rate level. Inflation has remained high despite the price pressure having become more moderate after the winter months thanks to lower energy prices in particular. Core inflation has  however  persisted at a high level and clearly above the two per cent target of the central banks. The European Central Bank still continued to hike rates in June. The market expects the interest rate hikes to still continue in July. Inflation is projected to slow to below two per cent in 2024.The persistently high inflation has weakened consumers’ purchasing power  but the good employment situation has maintained service sector demand and stimulated the economy. Due to the increased interest rates  Finland will likely drift into a mild recession this year  and GDP is projected to grow by approximately one per cent in 2024 thanks to slower inflation and higher income growth.With the volume of new housing construction projects commenced declining  the supply of rental homes is also projected to decrease in the next few years. This is anticipated to improve the occupancy rate and opportunities to transfer the higher costs to apartment rents. Higher maintenance costs will be reflected in more substantial rent increases in the future.The urbanisation trend continues and dense urban housing is becoming increasingly popular in Finland. There is demand for rental homes in growth centres close to good public transport connections and services. The economic uncertainty and the climbing home loan interest rates coupled with increasing energy and other costs also contributes towards growth in demand for rental housing. Some of those looking for a home to buy are now also considering a rental home as an option.In line with its majority shareholder’s operating model  SATO Corporation will not publish guidance on its 2023 earnings.

As at 17 July 2023  the Company's shares were trading at a discount of 5.82% to Net Asset Value (""NAV""). The estimated NAV per share and mid-market share price stood at 101.19p and 95.30p respectively. The Company TwentyFour Income Fund Limited (the ""Company"" and ""TFIF"") was incorporated with limited liability in Guernsey  as a closed-ended investment company on 11 January 2013. The Company's shares (""Ordinary Shares""  being the sole share class) were listed with a Premium Listing on the Official List of the UK Listing Authority and admitted to trading on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange on 6 March 2013. On 16 September 2022  the Company was included in the London Stock Exchange's FTSE 250 Index. The inclusion was largely due to the increase in the net asset value of the Company  following its acquisition of the assets of UK Mortgages Limited (""UKML"") in March 2022. Investment Objective and Investment Policy The Company's investment objective is to generate attractive risk adjusted returns principally through income distributions. The Company's investment policy is to invest in a diversified portfolio of predominantly UK and European Asset Backed Securities (""ABS""). The Company maintains a Portfolio largely diversified by the issuer  it being anticipated that the Portfolio will comprise at least 50 Asset Backed Securities at all times. Target Returns The Company has a target annual net total return on the Company's NAV of between 6% and 9% per annum  which  until 21 September 2022  included quarterly dividends with a target yield each financial year of 6% (the equivalent of 6 pence per Ordinary Share) or higher  of the Issue Price*. On 21 September 2022  the annual target dividend was changed to 7% (the equivalent of 7 pence per Ordinary Share) or higher  of the Issue Price. The change became effective from the dividend declared in respect of the 3-month period ended 30 September 2022. On 24 February 2023  a further increase in the annual target dividend to 8% was agreed  (the equivalent of 8 pence per Ordinary Share) or higher  of the Issue Price. The change became effective from the dividend declared in respect of the 3-month period ended 31 March 2023. The increases in the annual target yield are intended to increase the rate of return to investors during the financial year  following recent increases in global interest base-rates. Ongoing Charges Ongoing charges for the year ended 31 March 2023 have been calculated in accordance with the Association of Investment Companies (the ""AIC"") recommended methodology. The ongoing charges for the year ended 31 March 2023 were 0.78% (31 March 2022: 0.97%). * The Issue Price being £1.00. This is a target only and not a profit forecast. There can be no assurance that this target will be met or that the Company shall pay any dividends at all. This target return should not be taken as an indication of the Company's expected or actual current or future results. The Company's actual return will depend upon a number of factors  including the number of Ordinary Shares outstanding and the Company's total expense ratio  as defined by the AIC's ongoing charges methodology. Potential investors should decide for themselves whether or not the return is reasonable and achievable in deciding whether to invest in or retain or increase their investment in the Company. Further details on the Company's financial risk management can be found in note 17. CHAIR'S STATEMENT for the year ended 31 March 2023 Bronwyn Curtis OBE In my capacity as Chair of the Board of Directors of TwentyFour Income Fund Limited  I am pleased to present my report on the Company's progress for the year ended 31 March 2023. Investment Performance The dividends declared by TFIF during the year ended 31 March 2023 were 9.46 pence per ordinary share  with 7.27p per ordinary share paid during the year  which is an excellent result for a period when equities  bonds and property have all been weak. The strategy of investing in higher yielding floating rate asset backed securities in a rising interest rate environment has enabled the Company to deliver these attractive dividends  as all excess investment income is paid out each year. We have also been able to increase the target base  annual income distribution for TFIF   initially to 7p in September 2022  and then to 8p per ordinary share in February 2023 (from 6p at the start of the year)  paid on a quarterly basis. Any additional income generated over and above the 8p will continue to be paid out in the final dividend. The market volatility seen in all fixed income products did impact the Company's NAV and share price. TFIF delivered a share price total return of positive 0.87% and the total return of the net asset value was negative 3.61%. Despite this difficult environment  TFIF shares mostly traded at a premium and 79.1m TFIF shares were issued during the financial year. The portfolio did not see any material interest deferrals or defaults during this financial year. The Company raised a net £34m at the triennial share realisation opportunity in October 2022 as demand for tendered shares in the subsequent placing programme exceeded supply. It was one of the few successful fund raisings that month in the London market  as it took place around the time of the UK mini budget when market turmoil was at its height. Market Overview The Russian invasion of Ukraine just prior to the start of the Company's financial year caused credit spreads to widen as risk sentiment in all markets deteriorated quickly. The Company did not have any direct or indirect exposure to Russia or Ukraine and  to date  has not had any direct impact from the various sanctions imposed on Russia. The resulting increase in energy prices caused inflation to surge to the highest level for 40 years and central banks responded by rapidly increasing key interest rates. As the Company invests in floating rate bonds  this has had a significant positive impact on income; all investments are either made in GBP or hedged back to GBP  so the income of the Company effectively tracks the Bank Rate set by the Bank of England. High interest rates and inflation  however  have put pressures on the cost of living  but as UK and European labour markets are still very tight and wage growth has been substantial  UK and European mortgage arrears remain at historically low levels. Non-prime consumer and auto loan arrears have started to increase and the Portfolio Manager has therefore increased the allocation towards other secured assets. The market turmoil following the UK mini budget resulted in the highest selling pressure in the European and UK Asset Backed Securities market since the Global Financial Crisis. With UK pension funds in need of liquidity  the Portfolio Manager saw this as an excellent opportunity to invest at yields not seen since the Company's launch in 2013  and the Board was supportive of the Portfolio Manager's decision to temporarily increase gearing to buy higher rated bonds that were accretive to the income. This was a liquidity event and the temporary sell off was not due to concerns about credit quality. In March 2023 bank debt spreads widened significantly after the collapse of various US regional banks and the unprecedented write-off of Credit Suisse contingent convertible bonds  which were ranked junior to shareholders in a surprise move by the Swiss regulator. Whilst RMBS are issued by banks (and other non-bank lenders) to fund mortgages  these loans have no exposure to the balance sheet of the originating banks  and the Board recognised the strong performance of the asset class during this period of broader market volatility. Dividend The Company distributes all its investment income to ordinary shareholders. In the current market the Company is targeting quarterly payments equivalent to at least 8p per year. The fourth interim dividend is used to distribute any residual income generated in the year. As mentioned above  dividends paid by the Company in the year ended 31 March 2023 totalled 7.27p per ordinary share. The increase in dividends this year was driven by two main factors; the increase in the UK Bank Rate (which rose by 3.5% from 0.75% to 4.25% in the year to 31 March 2023)  and the effect of bond amortisations and share issuance which enabled the Portfolio Manager to invest at the prevailing higher bond yields that were more accretive to the income of the Company. Premium/Discount and Share Capital Management The share price started the year at an 4.85% discount to NAV mainly due to market sentiment following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. However  from summer 2022 the shares have traded consistently at a 1-2% premium  except for a very short period after the UK mini budget  and a brief fall over the year end date to -0.47%. Discounts in the UK Investment Company sector have widened significantly at the time of writing and the board has been having regular discussions with the Company's broker to determine if any additional discount control measures will be required to help mitigate volatility in the Company's share price. Shares were issued to shareholders to an amount of 79 094 006 in the 12 months to 31 March 2023  of which £34m was in relation to the excess demand for shares at the realisation event  and £4m was raised through numerous ongoing tap issues throughout the year. The Board is grateful for the continued support from our investors  and has approved a continued share issuance program to reflect the continued investment opportunities in this sector. Annual General Meeting The Company's 2023 Annual General Meeting (""AGM"") will be held at the offices of Northern Trust International Fund Administration Services (Guernsey) Limited  Trafalgar Court  Les Banques  St Peter Port  Guernsey  Channel Islands on 14 September 2023 at 12:30 pm. Board Composition I assumed the Chair position on 14 October 2022  having joined the Board as Chair-elect on 12 July 2022. The former Chair  Trevor Ash stepped down as Chair- at the AGM  along with Ian Burns  who retired from his position as Senior Independent Director and Audit Chair  both having served on the Board since January 2013. John Le Poidevin has taken over as Audit Chair  and Joanne Fintzen became the Senior Independent Director during the year. John de Garis assumed the role of Chair of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee during the year. In line with the succession planning for Richard Burwood  Paul Le Page joined the Board on 16 March 2023. Richard will step down at the Company's forthcoming AGM. I would like to thank Trevor  Ian  and Richard for their hard work and valued contribution to the Company during their tenures on the Board. I have every confidence that the Shareholders are in very good hands with an experienced Board of diverse skills. The changes to the Board composition over the period have ensured that the Company is represented by an appropriate breadth of skills  diversity and knowledge. Realisation Opportunity As reported in the Company's Interim Financial Statements  the triennial share realisation opportunity took place in October 2022. It is very pleasing to note that the net fund raising that resulted was one of the very few successful fund raisings in October 2022 in the London market. The Board sees this result  against a very difficult back-drop  as a vote of confidence by our investors in the Company's investment strategy. Only 1.5% of shares were redeemed  whilst a net additional £34 million of share capital was raised as a result of the process. Corporate Events The Company was promoted to the London Stock Exchange's FTSE 250 index following the quarterly reshuffle  effective 16 September 2022. The Board welcomed the promotion as a positive development  increasing the Company's stock market profile and helping to diversify the investor base. Outlook Inflation and recessionary fears  in addition to the ongoing problems in commercial real estate and banks  are likely to persist into the 2023/24 financial year  and market volatility is likely to remain elevated. Current valuations reflect modest recessionary yields  so the Company is  in our view  in a good position to benefit from potential market dislocations. While a deterioration of fundamental performance of the investment asset class of the Company is expected (mostly co-related to unemployment  house prices  corporate earnings and defaults) the Board remains confident in the Portfolio Manager's underwriting and stress testing which the Board believes to be instrumental to avoiding bond defaults and significant price drops  especially as an economic recession is becoming more likely. The Company's income is expected to continue to benefit whilst interest rates in the UK and Europe remain elevated. Bronwyn Curtis OBE Chair 17 July 2023PORTFOLIO MANAGER'S REPORT for the year ended 31 March 2023 TwentyFour Asset Management LLP In our capacity as Portfolio Manager to the TwentyFour Income Fund Limited  we are pleased to present our report on the Company's progress for the year ended 31 March 2023. Investment Background For the first half of the reporting period (into autumn of 2022) market sentiment as a whole remained very weak across all fixed income markets during what has been a period of elevated volatility  characterised by risk-off direction  challenging liquidity  the ongoing conundrum of interest rates policy  inflation and recessionary fears  the escalating Russia-Ukraine conflict and its associated energy supply/cost concerns. This was punctuated by the disastrous UK mini budget causing extreme moves in UK Gilt yields and the ensuing liability-driven investment (""LDI"") liquidity-driven bond sell off. Amidst this we did see short periods of stability  which in turn gave rise to windows of opportunity in both primary and secondary markets. Conditions recovered towards the calendar year-end as market activity shifted in line with economic data and more benign central bank rhetoric. The start of 2023 saw markets get off to the strongest start to a year since 2019  as a number of the issues that had driven risk appetite in 2022 started to ease  although after a strong rally in most parts of financial markets in January  February and March marked a return to more negative broader market investor sentiment. Renewed inflation fears and strong labour markets in the US  UK and Europe lowered the likelihood of a dovish pivot by the central banks in the near term. For primary ABS markets  issuance was a little bifurcated; the start of the Russia/Ukraine conflict and developing challenges in tech and crypto markets saw a hiatus in issuance in March 2022 but sentiment recovered quite quickly and April provided an attractive opportunity for investors looking to add floating rate exposure following the Bank of England moving ahead with rate hikes. The month was very busy across all asset classes  even as spreads widened across the capital stack  but was followed by a virtual slowdown in May  and then a small rebound in June. Despite the ongoing market volatility and weaker views  several issuers placed deals in July ahead of the summer. While August proved to have a relatively more constructive tone but was typically quiet with virtually no primary issuance. September saw a modicum of normality returning to the primary pipeline  allowing issuers to price deals into a receptive investor base early in the month. However  market conditions deteriorated sharply later in the month  triggered by the UK mini budget  and issuance ceased abruptly forcing one UK prime RMBS issuer to retain a deal it had planned to sell. Secondary markets also sold off heavily  more than wiping out the gains from the rally earlier in the month. The subsequent stress in Gilts and wider rates markets was compounded by the now well-documented bond sales by pension funds running LDI strategies. The ABS market saw extremely high levels of secondary sales in the run-up to month-end; over €4bn of sales went through the typical BWIC (""bids wanted in competition""  meaning a request for bids submitted by an investor to a number of dealers) in the last week of the month  more than in the previous three months combined. In the main  most of the selling activity was concentrated in senior AAA and AA RMBS/ABS/CLOs and Australian RMBS. Execution was good on the whole in terms of volumes traded as investors with cash to spend were able to add bonds at yields not seen for many years (excluding the small window at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic)  and dealers were seen to be providing liquidity in selective and preferred asset classes. Pricing clarity was challenging but spreads could broadly be characterised as having widened by 50-75bp in seniors and 3-7 price points lower in mezzanine bonds. The volume of RMBS/ABS and CLOs sold on publicly offered BWICs was unprecedented over a three week period  comfortably in the region of around €6bn  and not including similar-sized volumes which were reported to have traded bilaterally. Selling began to subside towards the latter part of October 2022 as markets became more orderly  although some selling moved on to mezzanine lists. Interestingly  not a large amount of sub-investment grade was offered for sale  endorsing the fact that the sell-off was purely a drive for liquidity from a relatively small group of investors and nothing at all to do with any credit performance concerns. Encouragingly  whilst spreads were understandably wider (although no wider than any comparable markets such as covered bonds or financials)  all the selling volume was absorbed and any liquidity fears that may have lingered about European ABS and CLOs has been well and truly erased. In fact  anecdotal accounts of sellers being unable to source liquidity in corporate bonds and turning to ABS to achieve it were heard repeatedly. The typically higher cash price of ABS (due to their floating rate nature  and therefore immunisation from interest rate duration) meant they were an attractive  if not the ""go to"" asset to sell in these markets as the sales had a lower P&L impact - arguably making ABS an unintended victim of its own success. Secondary markets dominated ABS and CLO trading flows during October and November in the absence of much primary issuance. Rishi Sunak's appointment in late October 2022 reassured markets  and the CLO market saw the first rumblings of primary issuance after a very quiet period. A handful of deals priced in October 2022 with several more being announced into a marketing phase. Challenges remained around the arbitrage; the rising weighted average cost of capital (to as high as 350bps) being considerably higher than the average 160-180 average range in 2021. This is due to the cost of the liabilities  mainly the AAA tranches still clearing around +220 discount margin (""dm"")  however there were windows where the underlying loan prices sold off enabling managers to add collateral. Primary ABS issuance remained fairly muted again into year-end 2022 as issuers had previously pushed back plans and although there were some notably large  and upsized liquid deals from UK and European Prime issuers during the period all of which were very well received. In contrast  the CLO market saw eight new deals price in November 2022  on the heels of a fairly buoyant October 2022  for a notional value of around €3bn which proved to be the busiest month since March. Secondary markets saw a much better tone into the year end after the havoc inflicted by the LDI sell off in the previous 6 or 7 weeks. Spreads  by and large  retraced across all sectors with most of the tightening seen in the investment grade space  whilst sub-investment grade lagged a little into the month end. This brought the overall volume of placed issuance for the calendar year to around €80bn including €26bn in CLOs. RMBS accounted for €32bn of issuance with the rest split between Autos and Consumer at €18bn. The year also saw a drop in CMBS primary to just €0.9bn. While this overall number was the second lowest annual total in the post-2008 period  it could be suggested that given the macro backdrop over the course of 2022  it was actually a reasonable outcome  as evidenced by the strong levels of investor interest in deals that came to market during the windows of opportunity. Spread performance in general over the month was positive with a noticeable investor bias to add risk in both CLOs and ABS. BWIC volumes returned to a degree of normality and execution prices remained strong throughout the month. Following on from similar generic moves seen in November  this put the market on a reasonably positive footing going into 2023. Underlying performance of assets for 2022 remained strong although expectations remained that there would be some consumer deterioration given the economic backdrop. The primary market saw a solid start to 2023 with a small handful of deals; the main themes during the first two months were a very strong spread performance across all asset classes  with the understandable exception of CMBS  and a lot of demand for bonds across nearly all rating bands. Notably two UK Prime deals saw very high levels of demand from investors with over-subscription levels of approximately three times. The pricing represented a tightening of 11 bps versus a benchmark deal that printed at the end of 2022 which in the AAA Prime sector is a strong rally in spreads terms. Mezzanine tranches too provided useful pricing points for market participants where bonds were available. Secondary ABS market spreads began the year on a stable footing and initially lagged slightly  but as the wider credit market compression theme filtered through  the direction quickly changed driving a strong risk rally across securitised products. This was also helped by the supply-demand technical  driven by low-ish and orderly primary issuance together with an atypical month of supply in BWIC volume of around €1bn all seeing healthy demand. Secondary CLO spreads saw strong performance with steady tightening throughout February. Also during February 2023 the ABS market saw Blackstone default on a single loan within a CMBS transaction (the loan being for Finnish offices) after it failed to get bondholder approval for a maturity extension. Whilst the Company doesn't have exposure to this transaction  and we are aware the income from tenants is enough to service the debt and the LTV on the mortgage is low  we will be following the process closely. The Portfolio Managers have been cautious on CMBS for some time and after a full sector review  sold various deals in the second half of last year. An active March 2023 in primary markets quickly unravelled as the US and European banking ""hiccup"" struck financial markets mid-month  which put paid to any further issuance until the last week of the month as spreads widened in quick order and borrowers waited to observe market developments. The ABS market bounced back reasonably quickly to the extent that BMW was able to place a £400m deal into the UK together with another Prime Auto deal in Germany  and a Green RMBS deal in Spain both placed by month end as ABS spreads  in general  retraced nearly all of their intra-month widening. On the CLO side  issuance remained fairly muted for another month with the sector now having seen just below €7bn of issuance year to date. Overall issuance volume for the first quarter of 2023 was a reasonable €20bn including CLOs. Performance Review The Company started the reporting period just after the invasion of Ukraine by Russia  meaning the risk sentiment in the credit and equity markets changed significantly as investors sought liquidity. Additionally  general risk sentiment had evolved due to expectations of high inflation  increasing interest rates and the general higher risk of a slowdown of the UK and European economies. Following a brief relief during the summer  floating rate fixed income markets were again faced with a large liquidity event  which was the result of the UK mini-budget as GILT yields increased significantly and UK pension funds had to sell assets to settle margin calls on their books. During this period there were no defaults in the portfolio  however  spreads had widened for most of the first six months of the financial year. As risk appetite returned in October  spreads retraced roughly half of this spread widening in the second half of the Company's financial year. For the Company  this resulted in increased NAV volatility  particularly due to the negative performance of CLOs through the Period as they correlated with High Yield corporate bonds  demonstrating significant volatility showing negative performance. In October 2022 CLO spreads briefly reached 1100 and 1650bps for BB and B rated bonds  but spreads rapidly contracted in the first quarter of 2023. CMBS showed similar negative performance over this 12 month period  but credit spreads in the sector didn't significantly tighten as concerns over (global) commercial real estate valuations increased and this was reflected in bond valuations. The Portfolio Manager viewed the illiquidity following the UK mini-budget  and the following spread widening  as an opportunity to buy assets (predominantly BBB to B rated UK and Dutch RMBS and BB rated CLOs) and increased fund leverage in the fourth quarter of 2022 to fund these purchases. This leverage was reduced in the first quarter of 2023 when credit spreads tightened and the Portfolio Manager sought to lock in this performance. As the Portfolio Manager views a future recession in the UK and Europe as very likely  overall positioning has changed to a focus on secured collateral (RMBS and CLOs) over unsecured consumer loans and SMEs  from Western European countries and they have further improved the average rating of the underlying portfolio. As SONIA has continued to increase through the year  the NAV has benefited from increasingly higher coupon payments. The total NAV performance for the year was -3.61%. The Company's NAV per Share ended at 100.89 from 112.45 at the start of the period  with dividends totalling 7.27p paid during the period. Portfolio Allocation Secondary spreads which had been relatively stable and constructive earlier in April widened  driven by an elevated amount of ABS selling from macro and institutional investors in order to fund fixed income outflows amid broader volatility. Combined with the substantial primary supply  this took spreads to levels not seen since the COVID sell-off. Bank trading desks had little appetite to add risk in any fixed income product and investors were able to pick and choose selectively where to add risk at higher yields. This allowed the investment team of the Portfolio Manager to gradually increase the purchase yield of the portfolio  over and above the natural yield increase generated by the rises in interest rates. Outlook Floating rate ABS began 2023 well placed with a strong income component through high spreads and increased base rates with more rises expected. Performance caught up in the first two months of the year  spreads remain wider. Highlights for the sector are expected to include robust deal performance across mortgages although some weakness is expected in consumer pools. CMBS is expected to be the weakest performer  with Credit Real Estate (""CRE"") valuations decreasing  and we anticipate selective loans with short maturities will face refinancing challenges. Other sectors are expected to perform well. Liquidity conditions have been restored after Q3 volatility and 2023 so far has seen strong and active investor participation  which we expect to continue. Default rates and ratings are expected to outperform in ABS relative to credit markets. We anticipate volatility to remain a theme through this late cycle phase and assets with stronger liquidity characteristics are preferred. EU ABS issuance has surprised to the upside so far in 2023  despite demand driven reductions in lending in Europe  as early year tightening of spreads has accelerated issuer plans. Bank issuance has begun to represent a larger share. This is expected to continue but predicated by the potential for disruption by wider market events.

Business Model and Strategy The Company is a closed-ended investment company  incorporated with limited liability in Guernsey. The Company has been granted exemption from income tax within Guernsey and the Directors intend to continue to operate the Company so that this tax-exempt status is maintained. Investment Objectives and Policy The Company's investment objective and policy is set out in the Summary Information. The strategy for the Company is to target less liquid  higher yielding asset backed securities. These securities  whilst fundamentally robust  do not offer enough liquidity for use in the typical daily mark-to-market UCITs funds  but are well suited to a traded closed-ended vehicle  where investors can obtain liquidity by trading shares on the London Stock Exchange. The view of the Board is that this part of the fixed income market has been largely overlooked and therefore represents attractive relative value. High Income The Company's income consists wholly or mainly of investment income and the Ordinary Shares are designed to offer a high dividend yield. The Board intends to distribute substantially all of the Company's income after expenses and tax to the holders of the Ordinary Shares  paying quarterly interim dividends with equal amounts paid in June  September and December each year  with a final dividend paying any remaining income being paid in March. The full year dividend per share for 2023 totalled 9.46p (2022: 6.77p) representing 99.89% of the total comprehensive income for the year. This is in accordance with the dividend policy approved by shareholders at an extraordinary shareholders meeting in May 2019. Long Term Growth in Capital Value The asset value of the Company's portfolio is heavily influenced by external macro-economic factors. The Directors meet with the Portfolio Manager regularly to discuss the portfolio. Additional details are covered in the Chair's Statement and Portfolio Manager's Report. Future Prospects The Board's main focus is to generate attractive risk adjusted returns principally through income distributions. The future of the Company is dependent upon the success of the investment strategy. The investment outlook and future developments are discussed in both the Chair's Statement and the Portfolio Manager's Report. The Board meets at least annually  to consider the long-term strategy of the business  incorporating presentations and discussion on longer-term opportunities and threats to the business. Focus is placed on principal and emerging risks which have the potential to disrupt the business model. Business Environment Principal Risks  Emerging Risks and Uncertainties The Board is responsible for the Company's system of internal financial and reporting controls and for reviewing its effectiveness. The Board is satisfied that by using the Company's risk matrix as its core element in establishing the Company's system  internal financial and reporting controls while monitoring the investment limits and restrictions set out in the Company's investment objective and policy  that the Board has carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Company. The Board also regularly meets to discuss any emerging risks affecting the Company and to establish effective controls to manage them. The below risks are all considered principal risks affecting the Company. Market Risk and Investment Valuations Market risk is the risk associated with changes in market factors including spreads  interest rates  economic uncertainty  changes in laws and political circumstances. Due to inflation concerns and existing geo-political tensions  both the UK and Europe could go into a prolonged recessionary period  therefore  risk premiums demanded by the market could continue to rise as risk sentiment deteriorates and wider spreads could result in lower cash prices. Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the portfolios may not be able to sell securities at a given price and/or over the desired timeframe. Investments made by the Company may be relatively illiquid. Some investments held by the Company may take longer to realise than others and this may limit the ability of the Company to realise its investments and meet its target dividend payments in the scenario where the Company has insufficient income arising from its underlying investments. Credit Risk and Investment Performance (Issuer) Credit risk arises when the issuer of a settled security held by the Company experiences financing difficulties or defaults on its payment obligations resulting in an impact to the security market price. The Company holds Asset Backed Securities which comprises debt securities issued by companies  trusts or other investment vehicles which  compared to bonds issued or guaranteed by governments  are generally exposed to greater risk of default in the repayment of the capital provided to the issuer or interest payments due to the Company. The amount of credit risk is indicated by the issuer's credit rating which is assigned by one or more internationally recognised rating agencies. This does not amount to a guarantee of the issuer's creditworthiness but generally provides a strong indicator of the likelihood of default. Securities which have a lower credit rating are generally considered to have a higher credit risk and a greater possibility of default than more highly rated securities. There is a risk that an internationally recognised rating agency may assign incorrect or inappropriate credit ratings to issuers. Issuers often issue securities which are ranked in order of seniority which  in the event of default  would be reflected in the priority in which investors might be paid back. Whilst they have been historically low since the inception of the Company  the level of defaults in the portfolio and the losses suffered on such defaults may increase in the event of adverse financial or credit market conditions. In the event of a default under an Asset Backed Security  the Company's right to financial recovery will depend on its ability to exercise any rights that it has against the borrower under the insolvency legislation of the jurisdiction in which the borrower is incorporated. As a creditor  the Company's level of protection and rights of enforcement may therefore vary significantly from one country to another  may change over time and may be subject to rights and protections which the relevant borrower or its other creditors might be entitled to exercise. Information regarding investment restrictions that are currently in place in order to manage credit risk can be found in note 17. Foreign Currency Risk The Company is exposed to foreign currency risk through its investments in predominantly Euro-denominated assets. The Company's share capital is denominated in Sterling and its expenses are incurred in Sterling. The Company's financial statements are presented in Sterling. Amongst other factors affecting the foreign exchange markets  events in the Eurozone may impact upon the value of the Euro which in turn will impact the value of the Company's Euro-denominated investments. The Company manages its exposure to currency movements by using spot and forward foreign exchange contracts  which are rolled forward periodically. Counterparty Credit Risk Where a market counterparty to an Over the Counter (OTC) derivative transaction fails  any unrealised positive mark to market profit may be lost. The Company mitigates this risk by only trading derivatives against approved counterparties which meet minimum creditworthiness criteria and by employing central clearing and margining where applicable. Settlement Risk Settlement Risk is the risk of loss associated with any security price movements between trade date and eventual settlement date should a trade fail to settle on time (or at all). The Company mitigates the risk of total loss by trading on a delivery versus payment (DVP) basis for all non-derivative transactions and central clearing helps to ensure that trades settle on a timely basis. Reinvestment Risk The Portfolio Manager is conscious of the challenge to reinvest any monies that result from principal and income payments and to minimise reinvestment risk. Cash flow analysis is conducted on an ongoing basis and is an important part of the Portfolio Management process  ensuring such proceeds can be invested efficiently and in the best interests of the Company. The Portfolio Manager expects £123.9m of assets to have a Weighted Average Life of under 1 year. While market conditions are always subject to change  the Portfolio Manager does not currently foresee reinvestment risk significantly impacting the yield nor affecting each quarter's minimum dividend and recognises the need to be opportunistic as and when market conditions are particularly favourable in order to reinvest any proceeds or in order to take advantage of rapidly evolving pricing during periods of market volatility. Operational Risks The Company is exposed to the risk arising from any failures of systems and controls in the operations of the Portfolio Manager  Administrator  AIFM  Independent Valuer  Custodian and the Depositary amongst others. The Board and its Audit Committee regularly review reports from key service providers on their internal controls  in particular  focussing on changes in working practices. The Administrator  Custodian and Depositary report to the Portfolio Manager any operational issues for final approval of the Board as required. Accounting  Legal and Regulatory Risks The Company is exposed to the risk that it may fail to maintain accurate accounting records or fail to comply with requirements of its Admission document and fail to meet listing obligations. The accounting records prepared by the Administrator are reviewed by the Portfolio Manager. The Portfolio Manager  Administrator  AIFM  Custodian  Depositary and Corporate Broker provide regular updates to the Board on compliance with the Admission document and changes in regulation. Changes in the legal or the regulatory environment can have a major impact on some classes of debt. The Portfolio Manager monitors this and takes appropriate action. Income Recognition Risk The Board considers income recognition to be a principal risk and uncertainty. The Portfolio Manager estimates the remaining expected life of the security and its likely terminal value  which has an impact on the effective interest rate of the Asset Backed Securities which in turn impacts the calculation of interest income. This risk is considered on behalf of the Board by the Audit Committee as discussed below and is therefore satisfied that income is appropriately stated in all material aspects in the Financial Statements. Cyber Security Risks The Company is exposed to risk arising from a successful cyber-attack through its service providers. The Company requests of its service providers that they have appropriate safeguards in place to mitigate the risk of cyber-attacks (including minimising the adverse consequences arising from any such attack)  that they provide regular updates to the Board on cyber security  and conduct ongoing monitoring of industry developments in this area. The Board is satisfied that the Company's service providers have the relevant controls in place to mitigate this risk. Geopolitical Risk and Economic Disruption The Company is exposed to the risk of geopolitical and economic events impacting on the Company  Portfolio Manager and Shareholders  including disruption arising from the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic  elevated levels of global inflation  recessionary risks and the current war in Ukraine. The Company does not hold any assets in Ukraine  Belarus or Russia  however  the situation in the region and wider geo-political consequences remain volatile and the Board and Portfolio Manager continue to monitor the situation carefully and will take whatever steps are necessary and in the best interests of the Company's Shareholders. This includes but is not limited to ensuring that the requirements of all international sanctions are adhered to and ensuring that the Portfolio Manager  Administrator and other key suppliers continue to operate all protections  protocols and monitoring of heightened cyber threats. The Company's key suppliers do not have operations in Ukraine  Russia and Belarus and there is not expected to be any adverse impact from military operations on the activity  process or procedures of the Company. Climate Change Risk Climate change risk is the risk of the Company not responding sufficiently to pressure from stakeholders to assess and disclose the impact of climate change on investment portfolios and address concerns on what impact the Company and its portfolio has on the environment. Regular contact is maintained by the Portfolio Manager and Broker with major stakeholders and the Board receives regular updates from the Portfolio Manager on emerging policy and best practice within this area and can take action accordingly. Environmental  Social  and Governance (""ESG"") factors are assessed by the Portfolio Manager for every transaction as part of the investment process. Specifically for ABS  for every transaction an ESG assessment is produced by the Portfolio Manager and an ESG score is assigned. External ESG factors are factors related to the debt issuers of ABS transactions and they are assessed through a combination of internal and third-party data. Climate risks are incorporated in the ESG analysis under environmental factors and taken into consideration in the final investment decision. CO2 emissions are tracked at issuer and deal level where information is available. Given the bankruptcy-remoteness feature of securitisation transactions the climate risks which the manager considers more relevant and that are able to potentially impact the value of the investment are the ones related to the underlying collateral which include physical and transitional risks. Those risks are also assessed and considered as environmental factors in the ESG analysis. Board Diversity When appointing new Directors and reviewing its composition  the Board considers  amongst other factors  diversity  balance of skills  knowledge  gender  social and ethnic background and experience. As at 31 March 2023  the Board is comprised of two female and four male Directors  which is expected to be a temporary situation whilst the Board is going through a transitionary period of Director rotation and retirements. The Board notes the New Listing rules published in April 2022 andbelieves that the Company meets the diversity targets required. The Company has no employees. The Board believes it is fully compliant with Listing Rules LR 9.8.6R(9) and LR 14.3.33R(1) in relation to board diversity which are: At least 40% of the Board are women (currently 2 out of 6 Directors are female  but one male Director is due to retire at the next AGM);At least one senior position held by a woman ( Bronwyn Curtis is currently Chair and Joanne Fintzen is the current Senior Independent Director); andAt least one individual on the board to be from a minority ethnic background (please see table below). Additional detail is set out in the table below: Name Gender Ethnicity Bronwyn Curtis Female White European Richard Burwood Male White British John de Garis Male White British Joanne Fintzen Female British/European Indian Paul Le Page Male White British John Le Poidevin Male White British Environmental  Social and Governance The Board recognises the importance of Environmental  Social and Governance (""ESG"") factors in the investment management industry and the wider economy as a whole. The Company is a closed-ended investment company with a limited purpose and without employees. As such  it is the view of the Board that the direct environmental and social impact of the Company is limited and that ESG considerations are most applicable in respect of the asset allocation decisions made for its portfolio. The Company has appointed the Portfolio Manager to advise it in relation to all aspects relevant to the Investment Portfolio. In keeping with the Board's expectation that ESG factors be taken into account  the Portfolio Manager has a formal ESG framework which incorporates ESG factors into its investment process. The Portfolio Manager has an ESG Committee representing all areas of its business  reports into the Portfolio Manager's Executive Committee. While there are no official ESG guidelines  the Portfolio Manager considerers ESG factors for every asset which it purchases on behalf of the Company and attributes internal scores to the assets in the Portfolio. The Company does not have executive directors or employees. It has entered into contractual arrangements with a number of third party service providers  all of which have confirmed to the Company that they have appropriate ESG policies in place. Service Providers Further details of the ESG policies and practices of the Portfolio Manager can be found at: www.twentyfouram.com/responsible-investment-policy www.twentyfouram.com/corporate-social-responsibility www.twentyfouram.com/esg-at-twentyfour-integration-and-engagement The Board undertakes annual due diligence on  and ongoing monitoring of  all such Service Providers including obtaining a confirmation that each such Service Provider complies with relevant laws  regulations and good practice The Administrator is a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of Northern Trust Corporation  which has adopted the UN Global Compact principles  specifically: implementing a precautionary approach to addressing environmental issues through effective programs  undertaking initiatives that demonstrate the acknowledgement of environmental responsibility  promoting and using environmentally sustainable technologies  and UN Sustainable Development Goals  specifically: using only energy efficient appliances and light bulbs  avoiding unnecessary use and waste of water  implementing responsible consumption and production  and taking action to reduce climate change. Engagement and Voting Wherever possible  on behalf of its investors  the Company is committed to actively engaging at a corporate  industry and regulatory level. The Company has contracted the Portfolio Manager to perform this function. It is noted that the Investment Portfolio is comprised primarily of fixed income assets. The voting rights attributable to these types of securities are usually limited in scope  and the opportunity to engage at a corporate level shall therefore  in most cases  be via interaction with senior management of companies during the due diligence process. A copy of the Portfolio Manager's Engagement Policy can be found at https://www.twentyfouram.com/engagement-at-twentyfour. The Company engages on behalf of its investors at industry and regulatory level primarily through its Service Providers  including the Portfolio Manager  the Administrator  and through the Company's membership of the Association of Investment Companies. Under the AIC Code  in the event that 20% or more of the Shareholder votes are cast against a Board recommendation for a resolution  the Company should explain  when announcing the voting results  what actions it intends to take to consult Shareholders in order to understand the reasons behind the result and following such consultation  should provide a final summary to Shareholders and in the next annual report. There is nothing to report in respect of the Shareholder votes held in the year. Position and Performance PRIIPs KIDs The Company has published a Key Information Document (""KID"") in compliance with the Packaged Retail and Insurance-based Investment Products (""PRIIPs"") Regulation. The KID can be found on the Company website at the web address below: www.twentyfouram.com/funds/twentyfour-income-fund/fund-literature/ The process for calculating the risks  cost and potential returns are prescribed by regulation. The figures in the KID may not reflect the expected returns for the Company and anticipated returns cannot be guaranteed. Key Performance Indicators (""KPIs"") At each Board meeting  the Directors consider a number of performance measures to assess the Company's success in achieving its objectives. Below are the main KPIs which have been identified by the Board for determining the progress of the Company: Net Asset ValueEarnings/(Loss) Per ShareShare PriceDiscount/Premium to Net Asset ValueOngoing ChargesDividends Declared Net Asset Value The Net Asset Value (""NAV"") per Ordinary Share  including retained earnings  at 31 March 2023 was 100.97p  based on net assets as at this date of £724 982 762 divided by number of Ordinary Shares in issue of 718 036 661 (31 March 2022: 112.45p based on net assets of £718 477 218 divided by number of Ordinary Shares in issue of 638 942 655). The financial year of the Company started just after the invasion of Ukraine by Russia  meaning the risk sentiment in the credit and equity markets changed significantly as investors sought liquidity. Additionally  general risk sentiment has evolved due to expectations of high inflation  increasing interest rates and the general higher risk of a slowdown of the UK and European economies. Following a brief relief during the summer  floating rate fixed income markets were again faced with a large liquidity event  which was the result of the UK mini-budget as Gilt yields increased significantly and UK pension funds had to sell assets to settle margin calls on their books. During this period there were no impairments to the portfolio  however  spreads widened for most of the first half year. But as risk sentiment returned in October  spreads retraced roughly half of the spread widening in the second half of the year. As SONIA has continued to increase through the year  the NAV has benefited from increasingly higher coupon payments. The total NAV performance for the year was -3.61%. Additionally  the Company has paid out all of its income as dividend (9.46p) and this has had an impact on the NAV. Share Price The Share Price is the price per share per Ordinary Share trading on the London Stock Exchange. On 31 March 2023  the share price was 100.50p (31 March 2022: 107.00p). (Loss)/Earnings per Ordinary Share - Basic and Diluted (Loss)/Earnings per Ordinary Share is calculated by dividing the net loss for the year of £22 595 345 (31 March 2022: net gain of £36 303 495) by the weighted average number of shares for the year of 664 696 773 (31 March 2022: 512 445 511). The net loss for the year has been primarily driven by a decrease in unrealised gains on investments. Market sentiment is discussed in further detail within the Chair's statement. Discount/Premium to NAV The discount/premium to NAV is a percentage difference in the share price per share to the net asset value per share. It is calculated by subtracting the share price from the NAV per share and dividing it by the NAV per share. If the share price is lower than the NAV per share  the shares are trading at a discount. If the share price is higher than the NAV per Share  the shares are trading at a premium. On 31March 2023  the discount to NAV was 0.47% (31 March 2022: discount of 4.85%). Ongoing Charges Ongoing charges for the year ended 31 March 2023 have been calculated in accordance with the Association of Investment Companies (the ""AIC"") recommended methodology. The ongoing charges represent the Company's management fee and all other operating expenses  excluding finance costs  share issue or buyback costs and non-recurring legal and professional fees  expressed as a percentage of the average of the weekly net assets during the year. The ongoing charges for the year ended 31 March 2023 were 0.78% (31 March 2022: 0.97%). The ongoing charges were calculated as follows: 31.03.2023 31.03.2022 £ £ Ongoing Charges Average NAV for the year (a) 670 955 356 576 399 204 Total expenses 6 828 728 5 571 225 Less: Expenses not recognised as part of the AIC Ongoing Charges Methodology (1 566 191) (130) Total recognised expenses (b) 5 262 537 5 571 095 Ongoing Charges (b/a) 0.78% 0.97% Dividends Until 21 September 2022  the Company maintained a dividend target of 6 pence  per Ordinary Share  per year in accordance with the Company's prospectus. On 21 September 2022  the dividend target increased to 7 pence  per Ordinary Share per year and on 24 February 2022  it increased further to 8 pence per Ordinary Share per year. If the minimum target of 6p for the year is not met  a Continuation Vote is required. The dividend yield for the year ended 31 March 2023 was 9.41% (31 March 2022: 6.77%) meaning that the Company met its dividend target for the current year. During the year  the following dividends were declared: Period to Dividend rate per Share (£) Net dividend payable (£) Ex-dividend date Record date Pay date 30 June 2022 0.0150 9 584 140 21 July 2022 22 July 2022 5 August 2022 30 September 2022 0.0175 11 198 996 20 October 2022 21 October 2022 4 November 2022 31 December 2022 0.0175 12 268 142 19 January 2023 20 January 2023 3 February 2023 31 March 2023 0.0446 32 483 815 20 April 2023 21 April 2023 3 May 2023 The Directors will continue to monitor the appropriateness of the dividend policy. Viability Statement Under the UK Corporate Governance Code  the Board is required to make a ""Viability Statement"" which considers the Company's current position  principal risks  emerging risks and uncertainties combined with an assessment of the prospects of the Company in order to be able to state that they have a reasonable expectation that the Company will be able to continue in operation and that the business model is viable over the period of their assessment. The Board considers that three years is an appropriate period to assess the viability of the Company given the uncertainty of the investment world and the strategy period. In selecting this period  the Board considered the environment within which the Company operates and the risks associated with the Company. The Company's prospects are driven by its business model and strategy. The Company's aim is to provide investors with an attractive level of income with a high degree of certainty around that income and a focus on capital preservation in uncertain times  by investing in less liquid  high yielding asset backed securities. The Board's assessment of the Company over the three year period has been made with reference to the Company's current position and prospects  the Company's strategy  and the Board's risk appetite having considered each of the Company's principal risks  emerging risks and uncertainties summarised above. The Board has also considered the Company's expected cash flows  income flows  its likely ability to pay dividends and analysis of the portfolio with reference to: liquidity analysis  including but not limited to  the changes in liquidity of the Company over time based on the liquidity of the underlying assets;foreign exchange analysis  including but not limited to  monitoring the effectiveness of the Company's foreign exchange hedging strategy;credit analysis  including but not limited to  analysing the current credit ratings and credit rating outlooks of the underlying securities by the main rating agencies  as well as sufficient diversification across sectors;valuation analysis  including but not limited to  assessing the pricing accuracy of the underlying securities; andsignificant accounting judgements  estimates and assumptions  including but not limited to  the fair value of securities not quoted in an active market  estimated life of asset backed securities and determination of observable inputs. In this context  the Board's central case is that the prospects for economic activity will remain such that the investment objective  policy and strategy of the Company will be viable for the foreseeable future through a period of at least three years from the year ended 31 March 2023. In making this judgement  the Board has assessed that the main risks to the viability of the Company are key global and market uncertainties driven by factors external to the Company which in turn can impact on the liquidity and NAV of the investment portfolio.A simulation has been designed to estimate the impact of these uncertainties on the NAV of the Company at times of stress  based on historical performance data  using techniques which analyse how changes in the Company's ability to generate income (by assessing different levels of reinvestment rates available as well as changes in FX and interest income generation  over a 3-year period) would impact the annual dividend the Company is able to generate. All of the foregoing has been considered against the background of the Company's dividend target. Key assumptions covered by the Board in relation to the viability of the Company include: Dividend Target The ongoing viability of the Company and the validity of the going concern basis depend on the Company meeting its dividend target annually during the three-year period. In the event that the Company does not meet the dividend target annually  as disclosed in note 20  during the three-year period an Ordinary Resolution will be put to the Shareholders  at the AGM following any reporting period in which the minimum dividend target of 6p per year is not met  with the continuation vote requirements set out in note 17. During the year  the annual dividend target was increased  as outlined on Summary Information. The Company's ability to continue to meet its dividend target is further disclosed in the Chair's Statement. Realisation Opportunity The next Realisation Opportunity is due to occur just after the AGM in Autumn 2025. The Board's view is that should the share price remains at the current levels  relative to the NAV  they would not expect to see a major incentive to redeem. Whilst there is no degree of certainty  rather like the Realisation Opportunity that occurred during 2022  there may be some redemption requests. In the past  these have been matched by secondary selling of the redeemed shares to new purchasers. It is believed the Realisation Opportunity is currently a low risk to the viability prospects of the Company. Market Uncertainty In the prior year  most sectors saw negative return on the NAV per Ordinary Share  as a result of spread widening  the negative contribution was largest for RMBS at -2.09% followed by CLOs at -1.37%. Volatility during the 1 year period (monthly returns) was relatively high for the NAV per Ordinary Share compared to historical periods  at 3.00%. Risk of Credit Losses The risk of credit impairment and losses increased due to the risk of default  caused by higher levels of inflation and increasing global interest rates. The Portfolio Manager continues to stress test the holdings of the Company  under scenarios that specifically address the impact of these significant economic events on individual loan pools  and analyse the performance of the underlying investments. The Portfolio Manager remains of the view that there is no material risk of credit issues on any holdings in the portfolio  and the rapid price recovery seen since October 2022 support their view at the time that  relying on their stress modelling  the material price moves seen were largely attributable to market liquidity rather than concerns around credit performance. Between 31 March 2023 and the date of signing  the Company's portfolio witnessed no defaults and no deferrals of interest payments. Section 172 Statement Although the Company is domiciled in Guernsey  the Board has considered the guidance set out in the AIC Code in relation to Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 in the UK. Section 172 of the Companies Act requires that the Directors of the Company act in the way they consider  in good faith  is most likely to promote the success of the Company for the benefit of all stakeholders  including suppliers  customers and shareholders.

Business Review The Company TwentyFour Income Fund Limited (the ""Company"") was incorporated with limited liability in Guernsey  as a closed-ended investment company on 11 January 2013. The Ordinary Shares of the Company were listed with a Premium Listing on the Official List of the UK Listing Authority and admitted to trading on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange on 6 March 2013. Investment Objective and Policy The Company's investment objective and policy is set out in the Summary Information. Acquisition of UK Mortgages Limited Assets during the prior year On 8 February 2022  the Company announced that it had agreed terms of a proposed acquisition of the assets of UK Mortgages Limited  (the ""Scheme""). The Scheme was to be effected through the reconstruction of UKML  consisting of the winding up of UKML  the transfer of the assets of UKML to the Company and the issue of new Ordinary Shares by the Company to the shareholders of UKML. Under the terms of the Scheme  the assets of UKML were placed into a ""Rollover Pool"" for transfer to the Company  with cash and other net current assets placed into a ""Liquidation Pool"" in order to meet any outstanding UKML current and future liabilities. The Company and UKML agreed to bear their own costs in relation to the Scheme. The proposed acquisition value was 84p per UKML share  less the costs of UKML in relation to the Scheme and the retention to meet both unknown and ascertained liabilities  divided by the total number of UKML shares in issue (excluding any UKML shares held in treasury by UKML) as at 18 March 2022 (the ""Calculation Date"")  subject to certain adjustments in accordance with the Scheme. On 3 March 2022  the Company published a prospectus on the proposed Scheme  along with a timetable. On 18 March 2022  it was announced that the Shareholders of both UKML had approved the Scheme by a special resolution. Trading in UKML shares was suspended on the same day. On 23 March 2022  the Boards of both UKML and the Company announced the final Scheme entitlements as at the Calculation Date. The Company issue price at that date  per new Ordinary Share of the Company  to be issued to shareholders of UKML  was £1.1421. The acquisition value per UKML share was £0.8331. 130 427 846 new Ordinary Shares of the Company were issued under the Scheme to former shareholders of UKML. The new Ordinary Shares issued by the Company were admitted to the London Stock Exchange the following day  with share certificates dispatched the week commencing 28 March 2022. The total value of assets transferred were: 4 Profit Participating Notes (""PPNs"") valued at £87.1 million (consisting of RMBS assets); Listed notes of £19.0 million and cash of £38.5 million. Discount/Premium to NAV The Board monitors and manages the level of the share price discount/premium to NAV. In managing this  the Company operates a share buyback facility whereby it may purchase  subject to various terms as set out in its Articles and in accordance with The Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008  up to 14.99% of the Company's Ordinary Shares in issue immediately following Admission for trading on the London Stock Exchange. On 22 August 2022  a Realisation Opportunity was made under which investors were offered an opportunity to realise all or part of their Shareholding in the Company  with Shareholders opting to redeem 9 582 068 Ordinary Shares for a consideration of £8 814 544. Subsequently  a Realisation Opportunity  where Shareholders of the Company (the ""Shareholders"") may apply to redeem shares up to 56 days before the relevant annual general meeting date of the Company (the ""Reorganisation Date"")  will be offered at the annual general meeting of the Company every three years subject to the aggregate NAV of the continuing Ordinary Shares on the last Business Day before Reorganisation being not less than £100 million. The next Realisation Opportunity is due to take place in Autumn 2025. Shareholder Information Shareholder information is set out in the Summary Information. Going Concern The Directors believe that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Financial Statements in view of the Company's holdings in cash and cash equivalents and the liquidity of investments and the income deriving from those investments  meaning the Company has adequate financial resources and suitable management arrangements in place to continue as a going concern for at least twelve months from the date of approval of the Financial Statements. The Company also achieved its dividend target of 6 pence per Ordinary Share per year  for the year ended 31 March 2023  meaning that as per the Company's Articles  a Continuation Vote is not required. The Company's continuing ability to meet its dividend target  along with the Company's ability to continue as a going concern  in light of the external geo-political and macro factors  the increased risk of default due to rising inflation  increasing global interest rates and the next Realisation Opportunity has been considered as part of the Viability Statement. No material doubts to going concern have been identified. On 31 March 2023  the Company's cash balance was 3.76% of total net assets (2022: 8.31%). Post-year end  the Company has maintained a positive cash balance and continues to meet liabilities when they fall due. The Portfolio Manager considers that cash management plays a key part in the management of the Company and continuingly monitors liabilities  including the Company's quarterly dividends. Results The results for the year are set out in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. The Directors proposed dividends of £65 494 843 in respect of income available for distribution earned during the year ended 31 March 2023  a breakdown of which can be found in note 20. Dividends paid during the year amounted to £47 555 276 as recognised in the Statement of Changes in Equity. Income available for distribution in any quarter comprises (a) the accrued income of the portfolio for the period  and (b) an additional amount to reflect any income purchased in the course of any Ordinary Share subscriptions that took place during the period (so as to ensure that the income yield of the shares is not diluted as a consequence of the issue of new shares during an income period) and (c) any income on the foreign exchange contracts created by the risk-free rate differentials between each foreign currency pair  less (d) total expenditure for the period. Portfolio Manager The Company entered into a Portfolio Management Agreement with TwentyFour Asset Management LLP  the Portfolio Manager  on 29 May 2014. Pursuant to this agreement  the Portfolio Manager is entitled to a portfolio management fee paid monthly in arrears  at a rate of 0.75% per annum of the lower of NAV  which is calculated as of the last business day of each month  or market capitalisation of each class of shares. For additional information  refer to note 15. The Board considers that the interests of Shareholders  as a whole  are best served by the continued appointment of the Portfolio Manager to achieve the Company's investment objectives. Alternative Investment Fund Manager Alternative investment fund management services have been provided by Maitland Institutional Services Limited (""Maitland"") since their appointment as Alternative Investment Fund Manager (""AIFM"") on 29 May 2014. The AIFM fee is payable quarterly in arrears at a rate of 0.07% of the NAV of the Company below £50 million  0.05% on Net Assets between £50 million and £100 million and 0.03% on Net Assets in excess of £100 million.

The Company is also required to comply with the Code of Corporate Governance (the ""GFSC Code"") issued by the Guernsey Financial Services Commission. The UK Listing Authority requires all UK premium listed companies to disclose how they have complied with the provisions of the UK Code. This Corporate Governance Statement  together with the Going Concern Statement  Viability Statement and the Statement of Directors' Responsibilities indicate how the Company has complied with the principles of good governance of the UK Code and its requirements on Internal Control. The Company is a member of the AIC and by complying with the 2019 AIC Code of Corporate Governance (""the AIC Code"") is deemed to comply with both the UK Code and the GFSC Code. The Board has considered the principles and recommendations of the AIC Code and considers that reporting against these will provide appropriate information to Shareholders. To ensure ongoing compliance with these principles the Board reviews a report from the Corporate Secretary at each quarterly meeting  identifying how the Company is in compliance and identifying any changes that might be necessary. The AIC Code and the AIC Guide are available on the AIC's website  www.theaic.co.uk. The UK Code is available in the Financial Reporting Council's website  www.frc.org.uk. Throughout the year ended 31 March 2023  the Company has complied with the recommendations of the 2019 AIC Code and thus the relevant provisions of the UK Code  except as set out below. The UK Code includes provisions relating to: The role of the Chief Executive;Executive Directors' remuneration;Annually assessing the need for an internal audit function; andThe means for the workforce to raise concerns. For the reasons set out in the AIC Guide  the Board considers the first three provisions are not relevant to the position of the Company as it is an externally managed investment company. The Company has therefore not reported further in respect of these provisions. The fourth point is not applicable to the Company  as it has no employees. The Board established a Nomination and Remuneration Committee  which held its first meeting on 14 March 2023. Prior to that date  the Board  as a whole  fulfilled the function of a Nomination and Remuneration Committee. Details of compliance with the AIC Code are noted below. There have been no other instances of non-compliance  other than those noted above. The Company's risk exposure and the effectiveness of its risk management and internal control systems are reviewed by the Audit Committee at its meetings and at least annually by the Board. The Board believes that the Company has adequate and effective systems in place to identify  mitigate and manage the risks to which it is exposed. Role  Composition and Independence of the Board The Board is the Company's governing body and has overall responsibility for maximising the Company's success by directing and supervising the affairs of the business and meeting the appropriate interests of Shareholders and relevant stakeholders  while enhancing the value of the Company and also ensuring protection of investors. A summary of the Board's responsibilities is as follows: statutory obligations and public disclosure;strategic matters and financial reporting;risk assessment and management including reporting compliance  governance  monitoring and control; and other matters having a material effect on the Company. The Board's responsibilities for the Annual Report and Audited Financial Statements are set out in the Statement of Directors' Responsibilities. The Board currently consists of six non-executive Directors  all of whom are considered to be independent of the Portfolio Manager and as prescribed by the Listing Rules. The Board considers it has the appropriate balance of diverse skills and experience  independence and knowledge of the Company and the wider sector  to enable it to discharge its duties and responsibilities effectively and that no individual or group of individuals dominates decision making. The Chair is responsible for leadership of the Board and ensuring its effectiveness. Joanne Fintzen has served as Senior Independent Director  following the retirement of Ian Burns. Chair The Chair is Bronwyn Curtis  who took over the role on 14 October 2022  following the retirement of Trevor Ash. The Chair of the Board must be independent for the purposes of Chapter 15 of the Listing Rules. Bronwyn Curtis is considered independent because she: has no current or historical employment with the Portfolio Manager; andhas no current directorships in any other investment funds managed by the Portfolio Manager; Biographies of all the Directors can be found in Board Members. Board Role and Composition The Board is required to ensure that the Annual Report and Audited Financial Statements  taken as a whole  are fair  balanced and understandable and provide the information necessary for Shareholders to assess the Company's position and performance  business model and strategy. In seeking to achieve this  the Directors have set out the Company's investment objective and policy and have explained how the Board and its delegated Committees operate  and how the Directors review the risk environment within which the Company operates and set appropriate risk controls. Furthermore  throughout the Annual Report and Audited Financial Statements the Board has sought to provide further information to enable Shareholders to have a fair  balanced and understandable view. The Board has contractually delegated responsibility for the management of its investment portfolio  the arrangement of custodial and depositary services and the provision of accounting and company secretarial services. The Board is responsible for the appointment and monitoring of all service providers to the Company. The Directors are kept fully informed of investment and financial controls and other matters by all services providers that are relevant to the business of the Company and should be brought to the attention of the Directors. The Board has adopted a policy on the tenure of its independent Directors that aligns with the AIC Code of Corporate Governance (""the Code"") that none of the Directors  including the Chair of the Board should serve for more than 9 years  even though the Board considers that boards of investment companies are more likely to benefit from a director's long association with a company in that they will experience a number of investment cycles. During the year  two Directors who had been appointed on the incorporation of the Company retired: Trevor Ash; and Ian Burns. One of the current Directors  Richard Burwood  was appointed on the incorporation of the Company and he will retire as a Director  at the 2023 AGM. The Board has also given careful consideration to the recommendations of the Davies Review and their implementation. The Board has reviewed its composition and believes that the current Board mix  allied to its recruitment plans  provide an appropriate range of skills  experience and diversity. The Board is committed to continuing its implementation of the recommendations of the Davies Review as part of its succession planning over future years and by complying with the disclosure requirement of DTR 7.2.8 in terms of the Company's diversity policy. The Board holds quarterly Board meetings  to discuss general management  structure  finance  corporate governance  marketing  risk management  compliance  asset allocation and gearing  contracts and performance. The quarterly Board meetings are the principal source of regular information for the Board enabling it to determine policy and to monitor performance  compliance and controls but these meetings are also supplemented by communication and discussions throughout the year. A representative of the Portfolio Manager  AIFM  Administrator  Custodian and Depositary and Corporate Broker attend each Board meeting either in person or by telephone  thus enabling the Board to fully discuss and review the Company's operation and performance. Each Director has direct access to the Portfolio Manager and Company Secretary and may  at the expense of the Company  seek independent professional advice on any matter. The Audit Committee meets at least twice a year  the Management Engagement Committee meets at least once a year and a dividend meeting is held quarterly. In addition  ad hoc meetings of the Board to review specific items between the regular scheduled quarterly meetings can be arranged. Between formal meetings  there is regular contact with the Portfolio Manager  AIFM  Administrator  Custodian and Depositary and the Corporate Broker. Attendance at the Board and Committee meetings during the year was as follows: QuarterlyBoardMeetings Audit Committee Meetings Management Engagement Committee Meetings Remuneration and Nomination Committee Ad hoc Committee Meetings Held Attended Held Attended Held Attended Held Attended Held Attended Bronwyn Curtis 3 3 2 2 1 1 1 1 8 5 John Le Poidevin 4 4 3 3 1 1 1 1 11 11 Trevor Ash 2 1 1 - 1 1 - - 6 2 Ian Burns 2 2 1 1 1 1 - - 6 5 Richard Burwood 4 3 3 2 1 1 1 1 11 11 John de Garis 4 4 3 3 1 1 1 1 11 11 Joanne Fintzen 4 4 3 3 1 1 1 1 11 9 Paul Le Page 1 1 1 1 - - 1 1 - - The number of meetings held indicates the meetings held during each Director's membership of the relevant Board or Committee during the year ended 31 March 2023. In addition to the scheduled Board and Committee meetings  11 ad hoc Committee of the Board meetings were held during the year which were attended by those Directors available at the time. Board Performance and Training During the year  the Board commissioned a review of its performance by external evaluation practitioner Trust Associates Limited. The review determined the Board's approach to corporate governance and its supervision of its regulatory compliance to be good. The review also determined the Board to be effective with independent thought and action with the right balance of skills and experience necessary for its proper functioning and the safeguarding of Shareholders' interests. Re-Election of Directors Under the terms of their appointment  each Director is required to seek re-election on an annual basis. At the 14 October 2022 Annual General Meeting  Bronwyn Curtis was elected to the Board and all other continuing Directors were re-elected. Trevor Ash and Ian Burns  did not seek re-election. At the Company's next AGM  Paul Le Page will seek election and Richard Burwood will not seek re-election. The Company may terminate the appointment of a Director without compensation immediately on serving written notice. UK Criminal Finances Act 2017 In respect of the UK Criminal Finances Act 2017 which introduced a new Corporate Criminal Offence of `failing to take reasonable steps to prevent the facilitation of tax evasion'  the Board confirms that it is committed to zero tolerance towards the criminal facilitation of tax evasion. The Board also keeps under review developments involving other social and environmental issues  such as the General Data Protection Regulation (""GDPR"")  which came into effect on 25 May 2018  and Modern Slavery  and reports on those to the extent they are considered relevant to the Company's operations. There are no findings to report at year end. Board Committees and their Activities Terms of Reference All Terms of Reference of the Board's Committees are available from the Administrator upon request. Management Engagement Committee The Board has established a Management Engagement Committee which meets at least once a year and comprises the entire Board  with Richard Burwood serving as Chair. Its formal duties and responsibilities include the regular review of the performance of and contractual arrangements with the Portfolio Manager and other service providers and the preparation of the Committee's annual opinion as to the Portfolio Manager's services. The Management Engagement Committee carried out a review of the performance and capabilities of the Portfolio Manager and other service providers at its 20 September 2022 meeting and recommended the continued appointment of TwentyFour Asset Management LLP as Portfolio Manager is in the interest of Shareholders. The Management Engagement Committee also recommended that the appointment of all the Company's current service providers should continue. Audit Committee The Audit Committee comprises the entire Board  with the exception of the Chair of the Board  with John Le Poidevin acting as Chair since the retirement of Ian Burns on 14 October 2022. The terms of reference of the Audit Committee provide that the Committee shall be responsible  amongst other things  for reviewing the Interim and Annual Financial Statements  considering the appointment and independence of the external auditor  discussing with the external auditor the scope and results from the audit and reviewing the Company's compliance with the AIC Code. Further details on the Audit Committee can be found in the Audit Committee Report. Remuneration and Nomination Committee The Remuneration and Nomination Committee has been established consisting of all Directors. John de Garis has served as chair since its establishment. The Committee met for the first time on 15 March 2023  where the Committee approved its Terms of Reference and a succession plan to replace Richard Burwood  following his imminent retirement at the next AGM. International Tax Reporting For purposes of the US Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act  the Company registered with the US Internal Revenue Service (""IRS"") as a Guernsey reporting Foreign Financial Institution (""FFI"")  received a Global Intermediary Identification Number (8V9U53.99999.SL.831)  and can be found on the IRS FFI list. The Common Reporting Standard (""CRS"") is a global standard developed for the automatic exchange of financial account information developed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (""OECD"")  which has been adopted in Guernsey and which came into effect on 1 January 2016. The Board ensures that the Company is compliant with Guernsey regulations and guidance in this regard. Internal Controls In accordance with the AIC Code  the Board is ultimately responsible for establishing and maintaining the Company's system of internal financial and operating control and for maintaining and reviewing its effectiveness throughout the year. The Company's risk matrix remains the core element of the Company's risk management process in establishing the Company's system of internal financial and reporting control. The risk matrix is prepared by the Board  identifying the risks facing the Company and then collectively assessing the likelihood and impact of each risk and the strength of the controls operating over each risk. The system of internal financial and operating control is designed to manage rather than to eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives  safeguard Company assets and maintain reliable financial information and by its nature can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against misstatement and loss. The AIC Code requires Directors to conduct at least annually a review of the Company's system of internal financial and operating control  covering all controls  including financial  operational  compliance and risk management. The Board has evaluated the systems of internal controls of the Company. In particular  it has prepared a process for identifying and evaluating the significant risks affecting the Company and the policies by which these risks are managed. The Board also considers whether the appointment of an internal auditor is required and has determined that there is no requirement for a direct internal audit function at this time. The Board has delegated the day to day responsibilities for the management of the Company's investment portfolio  the provision of depositary services and administration  registrar and corporate secretarial functions including the independent calculation of the Company's NAV and the production of the Annual Report and Financial Statements which are independently audited. Formal contractual agreements have been put in place between the Company and service providers. Even though the Board has delegated responsibility for these functions  it retains accountability for these functions and is responsible for the systems of internal control. At each quarterly Board meeting  compliance reports are provided by the Administrator  Company Secretary  Portfolio Manager  AIFM and Depositary. The Board also receives confirmation from the Administrator of its accreditation under its Service Organisation Controls 1 report. The Company's risk exposure and the effectiveness of its risk management and internal control systems are reviewed by the Audit Committee at its meetings and at least annually by the Board. The Board believes that the Company has adequate and effective systems in place to identify  mitigate and manage the risks to which it is exposed. Principal Risks and Uncertainties are set out in the Strategic Report.

(NASDAQ: VEON  Euronext Amsterdam: VEON)  a global digital operator that provides converged connectivity and online services  today announces changes to its management team  creating a leaner Group management in line with its portfolio size  while strengthening operating company boards.Group Head of Portfolio Management Dmitry Shvets  Group Chief People Officer Michael Schulz and Group Chief Corporate Affairs Officer Matthieu Galvani will be stepping down from their executive roles effective 1 October 2023. They will continue to support the VEON Group as directors on VEON’s Operating Company Boards. VEON’s Group Executive Committee (GEC) will comprise 3 members - Group Chief Executive Officer Kaan Terzioglu  Group Chief Financial Officer Joop Brakenhoff and Group General Counsel Omiyinka Doris – with a flatter Group leadership team structure.“It has been a privilege to work with Dmitry  Michael and Matthieu in our Group Executive Committee and I would like to thank them for their outstanding service  their exemplary leadership and their contributions to navigating VEON through the past challenging period. VEON Group as whole  and specifically our operating companies  will continue to benefit from their vast expertise and depth of experience as they will continue to be members of our operating company Boards.” said Kaan Terzioglu  VEON Group CEO.With the transition to a smaller GEC  VEON is developing its distributed decision-making model further  with a lean headquarters and increasingly self-sufficient operating companies  each with a local Board of Directors. The leaner Group management will increase VEON’s agility in decision-making at the headquarters level  and support Group’s evolution into a more compact and faster-growing entity as the Group’s portfolio evolves.This also follows the decisions taken during VEON’s recent Annual General Meeting (AGM) where the Company’s shareholders supported a smaller VEON Board of Directors  reducing the Board’s size from 11 to 7 members.About VEONVEON is a global digital operator that currently provides converged connectivity and online services to over 160 million customers in six dynamic markets.
