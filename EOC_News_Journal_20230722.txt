Marketing Authorization Application for Bylvay® for cholestatic pruritus in patients with Alagille syndrome,PARIS  FRANCE  21 July 2023 – Ipsen (Euronext: IPN: ADR: IPSEY) today announced that the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has issued a positive opinion recommending the approval of Bylvay® (odevixibat) fo…,English FrenchPositive opinion from Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) based on Bylvay Phase III ASSERT clinical-trial data in Alagille syndrome (ALGS)Negative opinion from Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (COMP) recommending not to maintain orphan drug designation for treatment of ALGSIpsen to appeal negative COMP opinion  which might delay final European Commission decisionApproval already granted by U.S. FDA in June 2023 for the treatment of cholestatic pruritus in patients with ALGS aged 12 months and olderPARIS  FRANCE  21 July 2023 – Ipsen (Euronext: IPN: ADR: IPSEY) today announced that the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has issued a positive opinion recommending the approval of Bylvay® (odevixibat) for the treatment of cholestatic pruritus in patients with Alagille syndrome (ALGS) aged six months or older.“We are pleased with today’s CHMP positive opinion which is supported by the data from our Phase III ASSERT trial ” said Howard Mayer  Executive Vice President and Head of Research and Development for Ipsen. “These children endure a very poor quality of life. The severe itching  known as pruritus  caused by the back-up of bile acids in the liver and bloodstream of individuals living with Alagille syndrome  sometimes results in scratching so hard it leads to broken skin. We are committed to bringing a much-needed additional drug treatment option to Alagille patients and families in the E.U.”The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (COMP)  a scientific committee of the EMA  has concurrently issued a negative opinion for the maintenance of Bylvay’s orphan drug designation in ALGS.This negative COMP opinion prevents the retention of orphan-drug status in Bylvay’s marketing authorization in ALGS and might delay a final European Commission decision. Ipsen plans to submit an appeal in respect of the COMP opinion.Bylvay  is an orphan medicine already approved in the E.U. for the treatment of progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) in patients aged six months or older. In November 2022  a variation application to the current market authorization of was submitted. The application sought approval in the E.U. for a second orphan indication for Bylvay  the treatment of pruritus in patients with ALGS. In 2012  Bylvay received orphan designation for the treatment of ALGS in the E.U.  which supported the development of Bylvay through preclinical and clinical stages.The CHMP and COMP reviewed data from the Bylvay clinical-trial program  including ASSERT  a double-blind  randomized  placebo-controlled Phase III  multi-center efficacy and safety trial conducted in ALGS. Positive data from ASSERT presented at the 2023 European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) congress  demonstrated that Bylvay provided highly statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in pruritus  starting as early as one week after initiation of treatment and were sustained over the 24 weeks of the trial. More than 90% of patients were pruritus responders (≥ one point change at any time during 24 weeks). The overall incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was similar to placebo. No patients discontinued the trial  and 96% of patients rolled over into the open-label extension trial.Bylvay was approved in 2021 in the U.S. as the first medicine-treatment option for patients three months of age and older living with cholestatic pruritus due to PFIC  and for the treatment of PFIC in patients aged six months or older in the E.U. In June 2023  Bylvay was also approved in the U.S. for the treatment of cholestatic pruritus in patients from 12 months of age with ALGS.Bylvay has received orphan exclusivity for the treatment of PFIC  and orphan drug designations for the treatment of ALGS and biliary atresia  in the U.S. and the E.U. In a potential future third indication  the rare pediatric cholestatic liver disease  biliary atresia  Bylvay is in late-stage development with the Phase III BOLD trial.ENDSAbout Bylvay® (odevixibat)Bylvay is a potent  once-daily  non-systemic ileal bile acid transport inhibitor (IBATi) that acts locally in the small intestine and has minimal systemic exposure. It is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of pruritus in patients three months of age and older with PFIC  where it has orphan exclusivity. Bylvay was first launched as a treatment option for patients with PFIC in the U.S. in 2021  where it is supported by a program designed to assist with access to treatment and patient support. Bylvay is also approved in the E.U. for the treatment of PFIC in patients aged six months or older. It has launched in over nine countries and has secured public reimbursement across several major markets including Germany  Italy  the U.K.  France and Belgium. In June 2023  Bylvay was also approved in the U.S. for the treatment of cholestatic pruritus in patients from 12 months of age with Alagille syndrome.View full U.S. prescribing information here: ipsen.comView full E.U. prescribing information here: Bylvay  INN-odevixibat (europa.eu)Important Safety InformationPFIC: The most common adverse reactions are diarrhea  liver test abnormalities  vomiting  abdominal pain  and fat-soluble vitamin deficiency.ALGS: The most common adverse reactions are diarrhea  abdominal pain  hematoma  and weight decrease.Liver Test Abnormalities: Patients should obtain baseline liver tests and monitor during treatment. Dose reduction or treatment interruption may be required if abnormalities occur. For persistent or recurrent liver test abnormalities  consider treatment discontinuation.Diarrhea: Treat dehydration. Treatment interruption or discontinuation may be required for persistent diarrhea.Fat-Soluble Vitamin (FSV) Deficiency: Patient should obtain baseline vitamin levels and monitor during treatment. Supplement if deficiency is observed. If FSV deficiency persists or worsens despite FSV supplementation  discontinue treatment.ALGSALGS is an inherited rare  genetic disorder that can affect multiple organ systems in the body including the liver  heart  skeleton  eyes and kidneys. Liver damage may result from having fewer than normal  narrowed or malformed bile ducts  which leads to toxic bile acid build-up  which in turn can cause scarring and progressive liver disease. Approximately 95% of patients with the condition present with chronic cholestasis  usually within the first three months of life and as many as 88% also present with severe  intractable pruritus. The estimated global incidence of ALGS is 3 in 100 000 live births. Currently in the U.S.  it is estimated that there are 1 300 patients who may be eligible for IBATi treatment.ASSERT Phase III clinical trial dataASSERT is a double-blind  randomized  placebo-controlled trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 120 µg /kg/day Bylvay for 24 weeks in relieving pruritus in patients with ALGS with 32 sites across North America  Europe  Middle East  and Asia Pacific. The trial enrolled patients aged 0 to 17 years of age with a genetically confirmed diagnosis of ALGS. In the primary analysis  the study met the primary endpoint showing highly statistically significant improvement in pruritus as measured by the PRUCISION Observer-Reported Outcome scratching score (0-4 point scale)  from baseline at month 6 (weeks 21 to 24)  compared to the placebo arm (p=0.002). More than 90% of patients were pruritus responders (≥ 1 point change at any time during 24 weeks). The study also met the key secondary endpoint showing a highly statistically significant reduction in serum bile acid concentration from baseline to the average of weeks 20 and 24 (compared to the placebo arm p=0.001). Statistically significant improvements in multiple sleep parameters were observed as early as week 1-4 compared to patients on placebo with continued improvement through week 24. In the study  there were no patient discontinuations and 96% of patients rolled over into the open-label extension study. Bylvay had an overall adverse event incidence similar to placebo and a low incidence of drug-related diarrhea (11.4% vs. 5.9% placebo).About IpsenIpsen is a global  mid-sized biopharmaceutical company focused on transformative medicines in Oncology  Rare Disease and Neuroscience.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law. Ipsen’s business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers.

Analysts pointed out that they had already been expecting meager figures following the lowering of annual targets in June. On the other hand  the shares of the Paris-listed subsidiary Stedim Biotech started with significant price gains  although they lost part of these gains in the course of trading. The gain was mainly attributed to the fact that the recently completed acquisition of the French company Polyplus by Stedim will apparently not result in a capital increase.At lunchtime  Sartorius shares lost one percent to 321.70 euros  after having recovered in the meantime and risen to 328.20 euros. At the same time  shares of the technology provider for the biopharmaceutical industry gained 3.0 percent to 244.50 euros on Euronext. However  Sartorius and also Stedim shares are currently both struggling at their 50-day moving average line  which signals the medium-term trend to investors interested in charting.Analyst Richard Vosser of U.S. bank JPMorgan had already expected a weak start to trading after sales and operating profit in the second quarter missed analysts' estimates. The negative development in the order book and the signals around the reduction of inventories still did not indicate any improvement  added another expert.Warburg analyst Michael Heider also complained that although the figures were weak  which had been expected after the profit warning  incoming orders  for example  had fallen even more sharply than he had estimated. Moreover  the confirmation of the recently lowered outlook does not imply a significant recovery in the second half of the year. The expert justified his ""buy"" recommendation by the very strong fundamental market data and the ""excellent market position"" of Sartorius.In contrast  Odysseas Manesiotis  an analyst at Berenberg Bank  sees signs of optimism at Sartorius  whereas the weak second quarter had already been sufficiently anticipated. He referred to statements by CEO Joachim Kreuzburg  who advised of an upturn in orders in the third quarter that has just started. ""We believe that Sartorius has bottomed out "" Manesiotis wrote.According to him  the fact that shares of subsidiary Stedim are outperforming those of the parent company on the day  relatively speaking  is likely due to management's statements on the ratio of capital expenditures to sales for 2023 and the ratio of net debt to operating profit. This implies  he said  that the group still plans to finance the Polyplus acquisition entirely with debt. According to his discussions with the company  it is likely that the acquisition will be fully financed through bonds./ck/tav/stw",negative,0.0,0.0,1.0,mixed,0.1,0.08,0.82,True,English,"['Stedim shares', 'disappointment', 'Sartorius', 'demand', '50-day moving average line', 'strong fundamental market data', 'Warburg analyst Michael Heider', 'excellent market position', 'laboratory equipment manufacturer', 'CEO Joachim Kreuzburg', 'weak quarterly report', 'Analyst Richard Vosser', 'U.S. bank', 'significant price gains', 'weak second quarter', 'weak start', 'significant recovery', 'Berenberg Bank', 'second half', 'third quarter', 'annual targets', 'other hand', 'Paris-listed subsidiary', 'capital increase', 'same time', 'technology provider', 'biopharmaceutical industry', 'medium-term trend', 'operating profit', 'negative development', 'order book', 'profit warning', 'buy"" recommendation', 'capital expenditures', 'Stedim Biotech', 'subsidiary Stedim', 'French company', 'parent company', 'meager figures', 'one percent', ""analysts' estimates"", 'incoming orders', 'Odysseas Manesiotis', 'net debt', 'Stedim shares', 'Polyplus acquisition', 'Sartorius shares', '3.0 percent', 'FRANKFURT/PARIS', 'Friday', 'lowering', 'June', 'part', 'course', 'trading', 'lunchtime', '321.70 euros', 'meantime', '328.20 euros', '244.50 euros', 'Euronext', 'investors', 'JPMorgan', 'sales', 'signals', 'reduction', 'inventories', 'improvement', 'expert', 'example', 'confirmation', 'outlook', 'year', 'contrast', 'signs', 'optimism', 'statements', 'upturn', 'management', 'ratio', 'group', 'discussions', 'bonds', 'ck']",2023-07-21,2023-07-22,marketscreener.com

Marketing Authorization Application for Bylvay® for cholestatic pruritus in patients with Alagille syndrome,(marketscreener.com) Positive opinion from Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use based on Bylvay Phase III ASSERT clinical-trial data in Alagille syndrome Negative opinion from Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products recommending not to maintain orph…,Positive opinion from Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) based on Bylvay Phase III ASSERT clinical-trial data in Alagille syndrome (ALGS)Negative opinion from Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (COMP) recommending not to maintain orphan drug designation for treatment of ALGSIpsen to appeal negative COMP opinion  which might delay final European Commission decisionApproval already granted by U.S. FDA in June 2023 for the treatment of cholestatic pruritus in patients with ALGS aged 12 months and olderPARIS  FRANCE  21 July 2023 – Ipsen (Euronext: IPN: ADR: IPSEY) today announced that the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has issued a positive opinion recommending the approval of Bylvay® (odevixibat) for the treatment of cholestatic pruritus in patients with Alagille syndrome (ALGS) aged six months or older.“We are pleased with today’s CHMP positive opinion which is supported by the data from our Phase III ASSERT trial ” said Howard Mayer  Executive Vice President and Head of Research and Development for Ipsen. “These children endure a very poor quality of life. The severe itching  known as pruritus  caused by the back-up of bile acids in the liver and bloodstream of individuals living with Alagille syndrome  sometimes results in scratching so hard it leads to broken skin. We are committed to bringing a much-needed additional drug treatment option to Alagille patients and families in the E.U.”The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (COMP)  a scientific committee of the EMA  has concurrently issued a negative opinion for the maintenance of Bylvay’s orphan drug designation in ALGS.This negative COMP opinion prevents the retention of orphan-drug status in Bylvay’s marketing authorization in ALGS and might delay a final European Commission decision. Ipsen plans to submit an appeal in respect of the COMP opinion.Bylvay  is an orphan medicine already approved in the E.U. for the treatment of progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) in patients aged six months or older. In November 2022  a variation application to the current market authorization was submitted. The application sought approval in the E.U. for a second orphan indication for Bylvay  the treatment of pruritus in patients with ALGS. In 2012  Bylvay received orphan designation for the treatment of ALGS in the E.U.  which supported the development of Bylvay through preclinical and clinical stages.The CHMP and COMP reviewed data from the Bylvay clinical-trial program  including ASSERT  a double-blind  randomized  placebo-controlled Phase III  multi-center efficacy and safety trial conducted in ALGS. Positive data from ASSERT presented at the 2023 European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) congress  demonstrated that Bylvay provided highly statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in pruritus  starting as early as one week after initiation of treatment and were sustained over the 24 weeks of the trial. More than 90% of patients were pruritus responders (≥ one point change at any time during 24 weeks). The overall incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was similar to placebo. No patients discontinued the trial  and 96% of patients rolled over into the open-label extension trial.Bylvay was approved in 2021 in the U.S. as the first medicine-treatment option for patients three months of age and older living with cholestatic pruritus due to PFIC  and for the treatment of PFIC in patients aged six months or older in the E.U. In June 2023  Bylvay was also approved in the U.S. for the treatment of cholestatic pruritus in patients from 12 months of age with ALGS.Bylvay has received orphan exclusivity for the treatment of PFIC  and orphan drug designations for the treatment of ALGS and biliary atresia  in the U.S. and the E.U. In a potential future third indication  the rare pediatric cholestatic liver disease  biliary atresia  Bylvay is in late-stage development with the Phase III BOLD trial.ENDSAbout Bylvay® (odevixibat)Bylvay is a potent  once-daily  non-systemic ileal bile acid transport inhibitor (IBATi) that acts locally in the small intestine and has minimal systemic exposure. It is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of pruritus in patients three months of age and older with PFIC  where it has orphan exclusivity. Bylvay was first launched as a treatment option for patients with PFIC in the U.S. in 2021  where it is supported by a program designed to assist with access to treatment and patient support. Bylvay is also approved in the E.U. for the treatment of PFIC in patients aged six months or older. It has launched in over nine countries and has secured public reimbursement across several major markets including Germany  Italy  the U.K.  France and Belgium. In June 2023  Bylvay was also approved in the U.S. for the treatment of cholestatic pruritus in patients from 12 months of age with Alagille syndrome.View full U.S. prescribing information here: ipsen.comView full E.U. prescribing information here: Bylvay  INN-odevixibat (europa.eu)Important Safety InformationPFIC: The most common adverse reactions are diarrhea  liver test abnormalities  vomiting  abdominal pain  and fat-soluble vitamin deficiency.ALGS: The most common adverse reactions are diarrhea  abdominal pain  hematoma  and weight decrease.Liver Test Abnormalities: Patients should obtain baseline liver tests and monitor during treatment. Dose reduction or treatment interruption may be required if abnormalities occur. For persistent or recurrent liver test abnormalities  consider treatment discontinuation.Diarrhea: Treat dehydration. Treatment interruption or discontinuation may be required for persistent diarrhea.Fat-Soluble Vitamin (FSV) Deficiency: Patient should obtain baseline vitamin levels and monitor during treatment. Supplement if deficiency is observed. If FSV deficiency persists or worsens despite FSV supplementation  discontinue treatment.ALGSALGS is an inherited rare  genetic disorder that can affect multiple organ systems in the body including the liver  heart  skeleton  eyes and kidneys. Liver damage may result from having fewer than normal  narrowed or malformed bile ducts  which leads to toxic bile acid build-up  which in turn can cause scarring and progressive liver disease. Approximately 95% of patients with the condition present with chronic cholestasis  usually within the first three months of life and as many as 88% also present with severe  intractable pruritus. The estimated global incidence of ALGS is 3 in 100 000 live births. Currently in the U.S.  it is estimated that there are 1 300 patients who may be eligible for IBATi treatment.ASSERT Phase IIIclinical trial dataASSERT is a double-blind  randomized  placebo-controlled trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 120 µg /kg/day Bylvay for 24 weeks in relieving pruritus in patients with ALGS with 32 sites across North America  Europe  Middle East  and Asia Pacific. The trial enrolled patients aged 0 to 17 years of age with a genetically confirmed diagnosis of ALGS. In the primary analysis  the study met the primary endpoint showing highly statistically significant improvement in pruritus as measured by the PRUCISION Observer-Reported Outcome scratching score (0-4 point scale)  from baseline at month 6 (weeks 21 to 24)  compared to the placebo arm (p=0.002). More than 90% of patients were pruritus responders (≥ 1 point change at any time during 24 weeks). The study also met the key secondary endpoint showing a highly statistically significant reduction in serum bile acid concentration from baseline to the average of weeks 20 and 24 (compared to the placebo arm p=0.001). Statistically significant improvements in multiple sleep parameters were observed as early as week 1-4 compared to patients on placebo with continued improvement through week 24. In the study  there were no patient discontinuations and 96% of patients rolled over into the open-label extension study. Bylvay had an overall adverse event incidence similar to placebo and a low incidence of drug-related diarrhea (11.4% vs. 5.9% placebo).About IpsenIpsen is a global  mid-sized biopharmaceutical company focused on transformative medicines in Oncology  Rare Disease and Neuroscience.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law. Ipsen’s business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers.

Accordingly  the company recorded a decline in sales revenue in the first six months of the year and a lower but still relatively high profitability. Company management confirmed the full-year sales revenue and profitability outlook  which was adapted in mid-June.“Our markets remained challenging during the first six months of the year. The soft development of order intake lasted longer than we initially expected  as customers continued to destock and invested less due to free manufacturing capacities. We expect these adverse factors to be only temporary and anticipate that demand will gradually pick up during the second half of 2023. In light of the strong fundamental growth drivers of our markets  we are continuing our global investment program while also adding innovative technologies to our portfolio. In this regard  the successful closing of the Polyplus acquisition will further strengthen our offering for the strongly growing cell and gene therapy markets ” said René Fáber  CEO of Sartorius Stedim Biotech.Business development 1As expected  normalization of demand continued across all regions in the second quarter and therefore dominated the first half of 2023 overall. Following the exceptionally strong previous years due to the pandemic  the business performance of Sartorius Stedim Biotech was significantly impacted by the expected inventory reductions and a general reluctance to invest on the part of customers in the first six months of 2023. Accordingly  sales revenue declined by 18.5 percent in constant currencies (organic: - 19.6 percent; reported: - 18.7 percent) to 1 402 million euros from the high prior-year level. Excluding the Covid-19-related business  the decrease was slightly above 10 percent in constant currencies. Order intake declined by 37.2 percent in constant currencies (reported: -37.5 percent) to 1 142 million euros.Underlying EBITDA stood at 416 million euros in the first half of the year  a decline of 31.5 percent  mainly as a result of the volume development. The resulting margin was 29.7 percent  compared with 35.2 percent in the prior-year period. Price effects on the procurement and customer sides largely offset each other.Relevant net profit was 242 million euros  compared with 405 million euros in the prior-year period. Underlying earnings per share were 2.62 euros (prior-year period: 4.40 euros). The number of employees worldwide stood at 11 135 on June 30  2023  compared with 11 934 at the end of 2022.Key financial indicatorsSartorius Stedim Biotech continues to have a very sound balance sheet and financial base. Equity was 2 603 million euros as of June 30  2023  corresponding to an equity ratio 1 of 50.2 percent (December 31  2022: 2 514 million euros and 49.6 percent  respectively)  and gross debt was 1 359 million euros (December 31  2022: 1 136 million euros). Net debt stood at 1 248 million euros  resulting in a ratio of net debt to underlying EBITDA1 of 1.2 (December 31  2022: 1 029 million euros and 0.8  respectively). Cash flow from investing activities was -262 million euros  compared with -180 million euros in the same period last year . The ratio of capital expenditures (CAPEX) to sales revenue was 18.7 percent (prior-year period: 10.4 percent).Polyplus acquisition successfully completedOn July 18  2023  thus after the end of the second quarter  Sartorius Stedim Biotech successfully completed the acquisition of Polyplus which had been announced in March 2023.Outlook for fiscal 2023Company management confirms its 2023 sales revenue and profitability outlook  which was adapted in June 2023. Accordingly  Group sales revenue is expected to decline in the low to mid-teens percentage range in the full year; excluding Covid-19-related business  revenue would decline in the high single-digit to low teens percentage range. Acquisitions  including Polyplus  are expected to contribute around 2 percentage points to the sales revenue development (excluding Polyplus 1 percentage point). The underlying EBITDA margin is anticipated at around 30 percent (previous year 35.0 percent)  whereby the positive margin effect from the Polyplus acquisition is not expected to have any significant impact due to its inclusion during the year.The CAPEX ratio in 2023 is projected at around 15 percent and the ratio of net debt to underlying EBITDA at slightly below 4. While the Polyplus acquisition has been included in this outlook  possible future acquisitions are not.All forecasts are based on constant currencies  as in the past years. Management also points out that the dynamics and volatilities in the industry have increased significantly in recent years. In addition  uncertainties due to the changed geopolitical situation  such as the emerging decoupling tendencies of various countries  are playing an increasing role. This results in higher uncertainty when forecasting business figures .1 Sartorius Stedim Biotech publishes alternative performance measures that are not defined by international accounting standards.

These forward-looking statements are based on current plans  estimates and beliefs of management. All statements  other than statements of historical facts  are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements  including estimates of revenues  operating margins  capital expenditures  cash  other financial information  expected legal  arbitration  political  regulatory or clinical results or practices and other such estimates and results. By their nature  such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and assumptions which might cause the actual results  financial condition  performance or achievements of UCB  or industry results  to differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Important factors that could result in such differences include: the global spread and impact of COVID-19  changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  will progress to product approval or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products  which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB's efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover  sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment  including pricing pressure  political and public scrutiny  customer and prescriber patterns or practices  and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes.
