the ability of aircraft to fly over a country - during national ATC strikes following recent industrial action in France.Last week  EasyJet blamed 'unprecedented ATC disruption' for cancelling around 1 700 summer flights  affecting more than 180 000 passengers as a result.Both EasyJet and Ryanair are continuing to operate flights as normal to wildfire-ravage Rhodes despite other airlines cancelling all holiday travel to the island.Due to the fires  shares in London-listed air carriers and travel firms slipped lower on Monday morning  with Wizz Air Holdings shares down 3.9 per cent to £25.64  EasyJet shares 2.65 per cent lower at 463.4p and TUI shares 2.4 per cent down at 594.5p  making them among the top ten largest FTSE 250 fallers.Ryanair shares were 2.8 per cent lower at €15.98 on the Euronext Dublin exchange.Danni Hewson  head of financial analysis at AJ Bell  said: 'Reports of holidaymakers having to leave hotels and sleep in sports halls or on the street could cause others to think twice about booking last-minute breaks  for fear they too could get caught up in the chaos.'Falling share prices for the likes of Jet2  EasyJet and TUI suggest investors are worried that they won't achieve near-term earnings forecasts and they will potentially incur extra costs for having to run repatriation flights to bring customers home.',neutral,0.01,0.95,0.04,mixed,0.08,0.05,0.87,True,English,"['traffic forecasts', 'Ryanair', 'wildfires', 'airlines', 'inefficient ATC [Air Traffic Control] system', 'French air traffic controllers', 'up to two months', 'The Irish low-cost airline', 'Wizz Air Holdings shares', '300 new Boeing 737-Max-10 aircraft', 'record passenger traffic', 'national ATC strikes', 'unprecedented ATC disruption', 'Higher average airfares', 'President Emmanuel Macron', 'controversial pension reforms', 'annual passenger outlook', 'supply chain difficulties', 'annual passenger numbers', ""Michael O'Leary"", 'rising mortgage rates', 'unnecessary CO2 emissions', 'recent industrial action', 'Euronext Dublin exchange', 'near-term earnings forecasts', 'current summer season', 'Falling share prices', 'jet fuel costs', 'Budget airline Ryanair', 'air carrier', 'new aircraft', 'three months', 'list prices', 'extra costs', 'aircraft shipments', '1,700 summer flights', 'first quarter', 'expected growth', '290 per cent', 'bumper Easter', 'Strong performance', 'ancillary sales', 'operating expenses', '50 million people', 'expansion plan', 'shareholder approval', 'older 737NGs', 'Dublin-based group', 'chief executive', 'living pressures', 'fare stimulation', 'seat capacity', 'urgent reform', 'flight times', 'European Commission', 'wildfire-ravage Rhodes', 'other airlines', 'holiday travel', 'travel firms', 'Monday morning', 'largest FTSE 250', 'Danni Hewson', 'financial analysis', 'AJ Bell', 'sports halls', 'last-minute breaks', 'Ryanair shares', '3,200 daily flights', 'repatriation flights', 'company poll', 'London-listed rivals', '600,000 daily customers', 'flight delays', 'weaker demand', 'Ryanair profits', 'June', 'analysts', 'Trading', 'May', 'update', 'potential', 'concerns', 'impact', 'wildfires', 'continent', 'revenue', 'rise', 'More', 'period', 'hundreds', '51 jets', 'end', 'April', 'July', 'order', 'part', 'goal', 'biggest', 'schedule', 'call', 'overflights', 'ability', 'country', 'France', 'EasyJet', '180,000 passengers', 'result', 'island', 'TUI', 'top', 'head', 'Reports', 'holidaymakers', 'hotels', 'street', 'others', 'fear', 'chaos', 'likes', 'investors']",2023-07-24,2023-07-24,thisismoney.co.uk

Through this partnership with Airbus  Astrocast expects to continue capitalising on their shared technological successes and further enhance SatIoT Bandwidth and Quality of Service for all customers. This will allow them to benefit from a continuous improvement of data transmission capacity  efficiency  latency and security. Customers will  in turn  be able to further optimize their operational efficiency according to their needs.""Through this partnership extension  Airbus reaffirms its commitment to Astrocast's technology roadmap and its leadership in the SatIoT space. This collaboration also lays the important foundation for potential convergences with the future 5G NTN IoT communications standards that are currently in discussion for LEO constellations. In time  these enhanced capabilities for collecting and exchanging critical data with IoT assets from multiple applications will benefit users across various key industries worldwide. Astrocast is not only poised to address these challenges  its roadmap is designed to take them head on for the industry.
