Trust)  formed by Mrs. Anne Beaufour and Mr. Henri Beaufour in December 19  2019  will not be renewed and will end in accordance with its terms on December 19  2023  at which time the shareholders’ agreement  jointly holding 52.06% of the capital and 66.66% of the voting rights of Ipsen  will end.These changes do not modify the shareholding held by the various legal entities linked to Mrs. Anne Beaufour and Mr. Henri Beaufour  and the parties to the renewed shareholders’ agreement1  holding together 56.62% of the share capital and 72.36% of Ipsen’s voting rights  will therefore continue to act in concert in relation to Ipsen3.The Board of Directors also takes note of the renewed support of the principal shareholders for the Group’s strategy and its Management.ENDS1 As referred as the ‘Schwabe shareholders’ agreement’ in Ipsen’s 2022 URD2 As referred as the ‘Ipsen shareholders’ agreement’ in Ipsen’s 2022 URD3 As referred in the attached appendixFor further information:Ipsen ContactsInvestors Craig MarksVice President  Investor Relations+44 (0)7584 349 193 Nicolas BoglerInvestor Relations Manager+33 6 52 19 98 92Media Amy WolfVP  Head of Corporate Brand Strategy & Communications+41 79 576 07 23Ioana PiscociuSenior ManagerGlobal Media Relations+33 6 69 09 12 96Ipsen’s forward-looking statementsThe forward-looking statements  objectives and targets contained herein are based on Ipsen’s management strategy  current views and assumptions. Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law. Ipsen’s business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers. The risks and uncertainties set out are not exhaustive and the reader is advised to refer to Ipsen’s latest Universal Registration Document  available on ipsen.com.APPENDIXShare Capital Gross voting rights Net voting rights Number of shares % Number of shares % Number of shares % Beech Tree(1)  including: 21 816 679 26 03% 43 633 357 33 02% 43 633 357 33 26% Directly by Beech Tree SA 8 310 253 9 92% 16 620 505 12 58% 16 620 505 12 67% Indirectly through MR BMH 13 506 426 16 11% 27 012 852 20 45% 27 012 852 20 59% Highrock(2) 21 816 679 26 03% 43 633 358 33 02% 43 633 358 33 26% MR Schwabe(3) 3 636 455 4 34% 7 272 910 5 50% 7 272 910 5 54% Finvestan(3) 187 923 0 22% 375 846 0 28% 375 846 0 29% Beaufour-Schwabe Concert(4) 47 457 736 56 62% 94 915 471 71 84% 94 915 471 72 36% Total 83 814 526 100 00% 132 122 911 100 00% 131 177 206 100 00%Note: Based on the monthly shareholding and voting rights declaration as of June 30  2023  as reported by the company(1) Beech Tree is a limited company under Luxembourg law whose capital is controlled on the date of filing of this document  by Henri Beaufour.

ARGAN  the specialist of PREMIUM warehouses rental & development  is confirming its trust partnership with DECATHLON. Our Group will indeed work alongside the retail company as part of its development with a new logistics site of 19 000 sq.m  located in the town of Montbartier (82)  North of Toulouse. The building integrates the Aut0nom® system to generate and use its green energy.This is a new logistics building of 19 000 sq.m that was built from scratch on the Grand Sud Logistics activity area (French Zone d’Activité) in Montbartier (82). This site that contains an office bloc of 900 sq.m  is now rented to the DECATHLON teams who were previously located in the town of Castelnau d’Estrétefonds  about fifteen kilometers away. This turn-key site was designed to fit the operator’s needs. These included setting up a rooftop and a network of textile ducts to help deploy controlled temperature for all cells; but also installing a paving that would meet specific needs – in particular those in terms of surface flatness to allow the use of robots to help prepare orders.This new development  the 4th made by ARGAN for DECATHLON  proves and strengthens the partnership between the two companies. This long-lasting relationship started in 2010 when the first site was delivered to the French specialist of sports gear  in the Lyon area.As it is now the case for all new ARGAN developments  this site is branded Aut0nom®. The installation of a photovoltaic power plant on the roof together with batteries for energy storage will help generate and use green energy on site to cover all of DECATHLON’s needs in terms of heating  cooling and lighting. Electric heat pumps provide the site’s heating and cooling  thus having a positive impact by replacing traditional gas boilers that are very CO 2 intensive. Lastly – still in view to ensure DECATHLON’s energy self-consumption – additional shade-structure photovoltaic panels help further improve the carbon footprint of the whole warehouse. Together  all these investments secured a BREEAM ‘Very Good’ certification for the site.Montbartier is an attractive logistics area about thirty kilometres North of Toulouse  which is at the junction of the A62 and A20 French highways that connect respectively Toulouse to Bordeaux  and Paris. Moreover  ARGAN is also opening a transaction option for a second development phase of 17 000 sq.m. Administrative authorizations having already been obtained  this second phase will be available only 12 months after an off-plan lease (BEFA) is signed.Ronan Le Lan  Argan’s Chairman of the Board of Directors declared: “This new development with a long-term customer is a perfect demonstration of ARGAN’s DNA as we stand by our clients and territories for the long run.

(NASDAQ: VEON  Euronext Amsterdam: VEON)  a global digital operator that provides converged connectivity and online services  today announces that it has filed its Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31  2022 (the “Form 20-F”) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission at www.sec.gov. The Form 20-F is also available on the Investor Relations section of the company’s website www.veon.com.As a result of its Form 20-F filing  VEON expects the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”) will confirm that it has regained compliance with the Nasdaq listing rules through the exception granted by Nasdaq for its delayed filing. The exception granted by Nasdaq was previously reported on Form 6-K on June 13  2023 and stated that the Company needed to file its Form 20-F by October 30  2023 to regain compliance with listing rules.The Form 20-F filed today also contains a correction to VEON Ltd.’s financial statements for the year ended December 31  2022 impacting other comprehensive income (“OCI”) but with no impact to “total consolidated equity”. After the issuance of VEON Ltd.’s Dutch statutory financial statements for the year ended December 31  2022 filed on June 25  2023 (the “2022 Dutch Annual Report”) and prior to the filing of the Form 20-F for the same period  the Company discovered an error with respect to the accounting treatment for the derecognition of its Algerian operations following the sale of the Company’s non- controlling interest of US$ 824 million. The non-controlling interest was incorrectly derecognized in OCI  a component within “equity ” while it should have been derecognized directly in “equity” without an impact in OCI. This error has no impact on “total consolidated equity.” In accordance with IFRS and Dutch law  the Company will correct and disclose the error retrospectively in its half-yearly financial statements and subsequently in the full year 2023 Dutch statutory annual report.Management has corrected this error in the Form 20-F and derecognized the non- controlling interest of $824 million related to the sale of VEON’s Algerian subsidiary directly within “equity” in the “consolidated statement of changes in equity”  which results in an adjustment in the “consolidated statement of comprehensive income.” The error has no impact on the result on the sale of the Algerian operations as presented on the “consolidated income statement” and no impact on the “consolidated income statement” as a whole. Additionally  the error has no impact on the “consolidated statement of financial position ” “consolidatedstatement of cash flows ” “basic and diluted gain/(loss) per share attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent”  “Adjusted EBITDA”  nor on VEON’s financial covenants for its financing arrangements.In light of this error  the Company’s management has concluded that the Company has a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31  2022 relating to accounting and financial statement presentation for disposals of businesses. Management is taking and will continue to take steps to remediate the material weakness and to strengthen the Company’s control environment. Management has also concluded that as of December 31  2022  the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. They reached this conclusion due to the presence of the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting. Refer to the Form 20-F for further details  including Item 15. Controls and Procedures and Note 24 to the consolidated financial statements in the Form 20-F.Shareholders may request a hard copy of the Form 20-F  including VEON’s audited financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2022  free of charge  by contacting VEON’s Investor Relations Department at ir@veon.com.About VEONVEON is a global digital operator that currently provides converged connectivity and online services to over 160 million customers in six dynamic markets.

Excluding non-recurring sales from the COVID business (€40.6m)  growth for H1 2023 therefore reached +37%.On a comparable proforma basis  i.e. excluding perimeter effects linked to acquisitions and non-recurring items1  growth of the core business remained dynamic  at +7%.in €m H1 2022 H1 2023 change. / core at constant scope TOTAL COVID core Revenues 83.6 40.6 43.0 59.1 +37% +7% unauditedSuccessful deployment of the Group's strategyThe Group is successfully pursuing its strategy of targeted geographic and technological expansion  with the ambition of becoming a major international company in the specialty diagnostics market  providing its customers with a comprehensive molecular diagnostics offering  including its own solutions and those of its partners.Share of proprietary products reached 30% of revenuesThe share of proprietary products increased to a high level  representing 30% of revenues (compared to 18% of core revenues in 2022)  thanks in particular to the contribution of GenDx  consolidated in the Group's financial statements as of October 1st  2022.Continued international expansion of the GroupInternational sales are growing fast  representing 35% of first-half revenues (against 25% of core business revenues in 2022). This increase is mainly due to the new acquisitions made over the past year in Belgium (BMD) and the Netherlands (GenDx)  as well as increasing cross-selling of the Group's own products.A new international entity joined the Group on July 5  2023. Following approval from the Italian competition authorities  Eurobio Scientific completed the acquisition of 100% of the capital of Diagnostic International Distribution SPA (""DID"")  a company based in Milano and specialised in the distribution of in vitro diagnostic tests for infectious diseases throughout Italy. Effective for accounting purposes as of July 1st  2023  this transaction opens the doors of the Italian market  Europe's 3rd largest diagnostics market. DID's core business (excluding COVID) generated sales of €10 million in 2022.OutlookWith the confirmation of the strategic priorities chosen over the last few years  the Eurobio Scientific Group will continue to expand on its three pillars: the development of proprietary products  internationalisation and foray into new markets.The Group is also pursuing the integration of its subsidiaries  and has recently made changes to its governance by setting up a Group Executive Committee.Next financial meetingH1 2023 results : October 11  2023  after market closesAbout Eurobio ScientificEurobio Scientific is a key player in the field of specialty in vitro diagnostics.

The minimum we’re calling for is protection of overflights during French ATC strikes and that hasn’t been delivered. Most of the ATC providers… are short staffed inexplicably  and are incapable of providing the staffing that’s necessary ” he said.The strikes have caused chaos throughout Europe  with low-cost favourite Easyjet recently cancelling 1700 flights for the summer  citing airspace restrictions due to the ATC feud and war in Ukraine.Piling yet more misery on holidaymakers  Europe’s airspace coordinator Eurocontrol recently warned that air traffic control across the continent would be overloaded at key locations  with further strikes in the next six months a distinct possibility.This  coupled with recently announced industrial action at Gatwick  has provoked fears in Britain of a repeat of last summer’s travel chaos.O’Leary’s comments this morning came after Ryanair announced its first quarter results  which saw its first quarter profits fly past pre-pandemic levels to €663m.It’s the first hint of its performance ahead of what is being touted as a critical summer period for the aviation sector as it looks to recover from the heavy losses incurred during the pandemic.Despite soaring profits  the budget carrier’s outlook was more tempered than expected  with issues including delivery delays  ATC walk-outs and winter demand highlighted as hurdles for the coming months.Its shares fell over 3 per cent on the Euronext Dublin exchange following the announcement.The European Commission was contacted for comment.,negative,0.05,0.42,0.53,negative,0.02,0.24,0.73,True,English,"['French air traffic control strikes', 'Ryanair chief O’Leary', 'EU inaction', 'Ryanair boss Michael O’Leary', 'French air traffic control strikes', 'Ursula Von Der Leyen', 'budget airlines’ combative chief', 'Ryanair chief O’Leary', 'pension age reforms', 'low-cost favourite Easyjet', 'Euronext Dublin exchange', 'first quarter results', 'next six months', 'first quarter profits', 'critical summer period', 'French ATC strike', 'The European Commission', 'French strikes', 'major airlines', 'French airspace', 'French passengers', 'budget carrier', 'first hint', 'soaring profits', 'coming months', 'ATC providers', 'ATC feud', 'ATC walk-outs', 'European governments', 'strike action', 'EU inaction', 'conference call', 'continuing failure', 'commission president', 'great hope', 'airspace restrictions', 'airspace coordinator', 'key locations', 'distinct possibility', 'last summer', 'pre-pandemic levels', 'aviation sector', 'heavy losses', 'delivery delays', 'winter demand', 'industrial action', 'travel chaos', 'term', 'handling', 'staff', 'shambles', 'analysts', 'Macron', '60 days', 'slew', 'hands', 'dispute', '4,000 flights', 'protection', 'cancellations', 'attack', 'correspondence', 'Nothing', 'minimum', 'overflights', '1700 flights', 'war', 'Ukraine', 'misery', 'holidaymakers', 'Eurocontrol', 'continent', 'Gatwick', 'fears', 'Britain', 'repeat', 'comments', 'performance', 'issues', 'hurdles', 'shares', 'announcement']",2023-07-24,2023-07-25,cityam.com

This growth was driven by a particularly strong demand in Entertainment. Order growth in Entertainment and Enterprise was offset by Healthcare  where order intake declined compared to a strong 1H22. With a positive book-to-bill ratio in 1H23  the orderbook expanded to 505.8 million euro.Sales grew to 520.9 million euro  a year-over-year increase of 10% and representing an all-time high for a first semester at Barco. Sales growth was driven by both business units in the Entertainment division  and also by Meeting Experience. Sales grew in APAC  Americas and most pronounced in EMEA. In China specifically  sales declined as the recovery in economic activity from the pandemic is taking longer than expected. Within the first semester  after a strong year-over-year sales growth in the first quarter  sales grew at a slower rate in the second quarter as this is compared to a stronger quarter last year  when demand surged after the pandemic.Division topline - growth driven by Entertainment; Healthcare below last yearThe Healthcare division reported lower sales and order intake compared to the record-high levels of the first half of 2022. In Diagnostic Imaging  a normalization of customer investment levels following government-supported spending during the pandemic resulted in a slight dip in order intake levels. Diagnostic Imaging sales approached last year's level  while  notably  sales of digital pathology displays grew. Surgical and Modality had a soft start to the year  both in order intake and sales  due to a timing difference between phasing out and phasing in of large contracts  notably in Americas  and higher customer inventories. In all other regions  orders and sales grew in the mid-single digit range.In the Enterprise division  order intake increased 4% versus the same semester in 2022  with both business units registering gains. Enterprise sales were close to last year's level  reflecting high single digit growth in Meeting Experience offset by a decline for Large Video Walls. Meeting Experience saw growth across all regions  reflecting continued high demand for ClickShare  Barco's flexible hybrid conferencing solution. Sales declined for Large Video Walls in all regions. Order intake grew both in Europe and APAC but was soft in the Americas where an uncertain investment climate delayed orders. Barco completed its strategic review of this business  with an increased focus on software and workflow solutions; for more information about the strategic review please see the commentary on the Enterprise division's results in Part 2.The Entertainment division saw strong growth in orders and sales across all regions  despite weakness in China. Sales grew 43% year-over-year and resulted in a record-high first semester for both Cinema and Immersive Experience. Cinema performed particularly well  reflecting investments by cinemas across the world in the upgrade of their lamp-based projector fleet by state-of-the-art laser projectors of the latest generation. The growth in Immersive Experience was fueled by live events  and by simulation. Sales conversion for Entertainment improved as production is no longer constrained by the component shortages that impacted results for the same semester last year.EBITDA expanded year-over-year  driven by significant improvement in EntertainmentEBITDA was 65.0 million euro  up from 46.2 million a year ago. EBITDA margin was 12.5%  which is 2.7 percentage points higher than the EBITDA margin of 9.8% in 1H22  driven by gross profit margin improvements.Gross profit margin was 40.9%  up from 37.9% in first half of 2022 and 39.9% in the second half of 2022  largely due to higher margins in the Entertainment division  where last year's supply chain constraints have eased  and brokerage and logistic costs have declined.Free cash flow for 1H23 was negative 24.1 million  including 20.9 million capital expenditure  mainly for manufacturing and customer leases. ROCE improved to 18% of sales.Quote of co-CEOs An Steegen and Charles Beauduin""We are very pleased that Barco reached all-time high sales during the first half of this year. We delivered on the particularly strong demand in the Entertainment markets. ClickShare continued to thrive on the hybrid conferencing momentum. As expected  Healthcare results were softer than last year while our perspective on the long-term demand remains strong. During the semester we completed the strategic review of our Large Video Wall segment and are now implementing changes to our business model and growth strategy to ensure sustainable profitability. Although the recovery from the pandemic in China is taking longer than expected  we believe in the long-term potential for Barco in this market. We want to thank our teams for their contribution during the first half year and we are going full force for another strong second half.""Outlook- Reconfirming sustainable profitable growthThe following statements are forward looking on a like-for-like basis and actual results may differ materially.Sales and EBITDA margin are expected to be higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year. We are expecting tempered topline growth due to China  resulting in an expected sales growth for the full year in the high single-digit range.EBITDA accretion will be maintained. The impact of lower sales is offset by gross margin improvement and a favorable product mix. Management reaffirms its expectation for an EBITDA margin above 14% for the full year 2023.We reconfirm our long-term guidance for a high single-digit sales CAGR and an EBITDA margin in the range of 14-18%.Please read the full press release in attachment.DisclaimerThis press release may contain forward-looking statements.

The grant amount reserved for TECO 2030 is EUR 2.3 million. The principal goal of the project is to accelerate the transition towards safe use of sustainable fuels in waterborne transport through full-scale demonstration of hydrogen fuel cells within maritime applications.A picture of the key project impacts: The consortium aims to develop a full hydrogen infrastructure for a hydrogen-powered vessel.The consortium consists of 14 partners from seven European countries covering the whole innovation value chain  including technology developers  academic institutions  maritime engineering  class society  digital transformation and a shipyard.The project is a Horizon Innovation Action that aims to develop  build and demonstrate a 35 meter  300 passenger capacity vessel that will be powered by the FCM400 fuel cell system by TECO 2030. The vessel will be operated in Southern Europe. TECO 2030 will work closely with all the consortium partners to develop the entire value chain ensuring full operational requirements for the vessel. This includes a functional hydrogen refueling system  fulfilling infrastructure requirements  cost optimization during operations and efficient data management.The project proposal was submitted in April 2023 and has been evaluated by experts in the European Commission in terms of Excellence  Impact and Quality. The project was among the highest-scoring proposals of this Call and has now been invited for Horizon Europe Grant Agreement Preparation. We expect the grant preparation process to be finalized later this year  and the project start date to be around January 2024.“I’m proud to announce that we have won our second Horizon Europe project! Winning two EU-projects out of two attempts is an extraordinary achievement  and I would like to thank our partners and our internal proposal writing team for their strong efforts ” said Fredrik Aarskog  Director of Business Development  TECO 2030.“We are thrilled to continue to showcase how hydrogen can contribute to the reduction of harmful emissions within the marine industry. This project has the potential to enable seaborn passenger transport  without any emissions ” said Tore Enger  Group CEO  TECO 2030. “Our fuel cells are the first purpose-developed marine fuel cells  with an industry leading footprint without compromising efficiency ” Enger concludes.Renewable hydrogen is universally considered to be an important energy vector in the global efforts to combat climate change by limiting greenhouse gas emissions to the ""well below 2°C scenario""  as agreed by more than 190 states in the 2015 Paris Agreement.Waterborne transport  in particular the use of large seagoing vessels  remains a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions and this sector must step up its efforts significantly and through a wide range of measures. Within the International Maritime Organization (IMO)  a global agreement was reached in 2018 to reduce total GHG missions from maritime transport by at least 50% by 2050 compared to 2008 as a base year.Contact:Tore Enger  Group CEO  +47 920 83 800  tore.enger@teco2030.noAbout TECO 2030 ASA:TECO 2030 is building up Europe's first Giga production facility of hydrogen PEM fuel cell stacks and modules in Narvik  Norway.

The Board intends that the costs of the proposals will be borne equally by all shareholders (whether electing for the Rollover or a Cash Exit). As such  both the Rollover and the Cash Exit will be effected by reference to the latest announced NAV per share as at the completion of the orderly realisation.The Board intends to maintain the Company's listing during the realisation period and will seek to de-list the Company and enter the Company into liquidation shortly following the completion of the Rollover and the Cash Exit. A shareholder circular containing further details on the proposed Rollover  together with election forms for eligible shareholders wishing to participate in the Rollover  is expected to be published in the second half of 2024.Mr Emmanuel Gavaudan  who holds 15.92% of the Company's issued share capital as at the date of this announcement  has informed the Board that he intends to vote in favour of the Managed Wind-Down.The person responsible for arranging for the release of this announcement on behalf of the Company is Guillaume Vinatier  General Counsel of Boussard & Gavaudan Investment Management LLP.For further information please contact:Boussard & Gavaudan Investment Management  LLPEmmanuel Gavaudan+44 20 3751 5389JTC Fund Solutions (Guernsey) LimitedSecretary+44 (0) 1481 70240024 July 2023Website: www.bgholdingltd.comThe Company is established as a closed-ended investment company domiciled in Guernsey.

July 24  2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Qualigen Therapeutics  Inc. (Nasdaq: QLGN)  a therapeutics company focused on developing treatments for adult and pediatric cancers with potential for Orphan Drug Designation  announces today that it has sold its FastPack® diagnostics business to Chembio Diagnostics  Inc.  an American subsidiary of French diagnostics provider BIOSYNEX Group  a leader in the design and distribution of rapid tests.The all cash transaction  which closed on July 20  2023  enables the Company to further streamline operations and enhance its focus with additional capital on its therapeutics pipeline  in particular QN-302  its small molecule G-Quadruplex (G4) selective transcription inhibitor  and its pre-clinical pan-RAS inhibitor platform. QN-302 has strong binding affinity to G4s prevalent in cancer cells and is being developed for the potential treatment of solid tumors including pancreatic cancer  for which it was granted Orphan Drug Designation in January.Michael Poirier  Qualigen's Chairman and CEO  commented  “We are proud of the legacy our FastPack® rapid immunodiagnostics system has established by providing patients and doctors with quality laboratory solutions for over two decades. However  as we have transitioned our focus to cancer therapeutics  it is appropriate that we re-align our priorities and resources. BIOSYNEX  with their proven track record in rapid diagnostics  has the expertise and resources to further expand FastPack’s footprint throughout the in vitro diagnostics (IVD) market worldwide. In the meantime  we now have the ability to strengthen our efforts towards advancing our cancer therapeutics portfolio and look forward to reporting further developments soon.”About Qualigen Therapeutics  Inc.Qualigen Therapeutics  Inc. is a therapeutics company focused on developing treatments for adult and pediatric cancer. Our investigational QN-302 compound is a small molecule selective transcription inhibitor with strong binding affinity to G4s prevalent in cancer cells; such binding could  by stabilizing the G4s against “unwinding”  help inhibit cancer cell proliferation. The investigational compounds within Qualigen’s family of pan-RAS oncogene protein-protein interaction inhibitor small molecules are believed to inhibit or block the binding of mutated RAS genes’ proteins to their effector proteins  thereby leaving the proteins from the mutated RAS unable to cause further harm. In theory  such mechanism of action may be effective in the treatment of about one quarter of all cancers  including certain forms of pancreatic  colorectal  and lung cancers. Our investigational QN-247 compound inhibits nucleolin  a key multi-functional regulatory protein that is overexpressed in cancer cells; QN-247 may thereby be able to inhibit the cells’ proliferation. QN-247 has shown promise in preclinical studies for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML).About BIOSYNEXFounded in 2005  French laboratory BIOSYNEX is a leading healthcare diagnostics group  specializing in rapid tests  monitoring of biotherapy and molecular diagnostics.As a key player in the medicine of the future  promoting improved access to healthcare  BIOSYNEX offers innovative healthcare solutions to a large range of users  including laboratories  hospitals  doctors and the general public  to improve overall patient care.For the general public: the BIOSYNEX Pharma division  specialized in self-diagnostics and family health products.

Just 27 per cent of chief executive appointments on Lon…,FTSE 100 CEO churn reaches five year high  but women continue to miss out on top rolesJust 27 per cent of chief executive appointments on London’s premier stock index in the first six months of the year went to females  according to Russell Reynolds AssociatesWomen are much less likely than men to secure the top job at Britain’s largest companies despite FTSE 100 firms shaking up their boardrooms at the fastest pace in five years  a new study out today shows.Just 27 per cent of chief executive appointments on London’s premier stock index in the first six months of the year went to females  according to Russell Reynolds Associates.Experts said advances are still too slow toward achieving greater gender diversity in the C-suite at Britain’s largest firms.“The FTSE 100 is making progress towards gender parity and we are seeing a gradual ramping up of the rate at which women are being appointed CEO ” Laura Sanderson  UK country manager of Russell Reynolds Associates  said.Read more In defence of landlords  by the Bank of England“But we must also be impatient for change. Until half of the people being appointed CEO each quarter are women  there is still room for improvement ” she added.Efforts to expand female representation at board level have ramped up in recent years  with FTSE 350 constituents aiming to have four out of every 10 senior jobs held by women by 2025. They met that target early in February.That drive is likely to have helped push the last six months’ female CEO appointment rate above the five year average of 16 per cent. On the UK’s mid-cap FTSE 250 index  10 per cent of leadership appointments went to women.There may be a renewed campaign for greater gender balance in boardrooms in response to signs that boards still “overwhelmingly favour men” for top jobs  Russell Reynolds Associates said.FTSE 100 companies compare favourably to their international peers when it comes to female CEO appointments.Over the last five years  just nine per cent of those gigs on the S&P 500 have been given to women.European boards are the most likely to back women for the elite job  with females making up 20 per cent of CEO appointments on the Euronext 100 over the last five years.Some 11 per cent of FTSE 100 CEO positions changed hands in the first half of 2023  the biggest share in five years and up 38 per cent compared to the same period a year ago.A change of direction after the end of the Covid-19 crisis was cited as a motivating factor among FTSE 100 firms to oust their chief by Russell Reynolds Associates.“Much of this is still part of post-covid reset strategies  as businesses adjust to realities of a world no longer reeling from a pandemic ” Luke Meynell  managing director  co-lead and co-lead global board and CEO advisory partners of Russell Reynolds Associates  said.A global economic slowdown fashioned by inflation reaching multi-decade highs and central banks responding by hiking interest rates aggressively has helped push UK profit warnings up seven quarters in a row  the longest streak since the 2008 financial crisis.As a result boards may have been keen to revamp their leadership in a bid to repair their finances.Going forward  CEO churn may settle down due to C-suites sticking with “a safe pair of hands to steer them through the turbulent waters ahead ” Meynell added.In the last three months  Vodafone  British American Tobacco and Diageo announced new CEOs.,neutral,0.06,0.64,0.3,negative,0.02,0.29,0.69,True,English,"['FTSE 100 CEO', 'top roles', 'women', 'last six months’ female CEO appointment rate', 'first six months', 'last three months', 'female CEO appointments', 'premier stock index', 'Russell Reynolds Associates', 'last five years', 'post-covid reset strategies', 'global economic slowdown', 'British American Tobacco', 'CEO advisory partners', 'greater gender diversity', 'greater gender balance', 'UK country manager', 'UK profit warnings', 'mid-cap FTSE 250 index', 'FTSE 100 CEO positions', 'chief executive appointments', 'lead global board', 'nine per cent', 'five year average', 'female representation', 'CEO churn', 'gender parity', 'board level', 'recent years', '27 per cent', '16 per cent', '10 per cent', '20 per cent', '11 per cent', 'FTSE 100 firms', 'The FTSE 100', 'FTSE 350 constituents', 'FTSE 100 companies', 'first half', 'leadership appointments', 'top roles', 'top job', 'largest companies', 'fastest pace', 'new study', 'largest firms', 'gradual ramping', 'Laura Sanderson', '10 senior jobs', 'international peers', 'S&P 500', 'elite job', 'biggest share', 'same period', 'Covid-19 crisis', 'motivating factor', 'managing director', 'multi-decade highs', 'central banks', 'interest rates', 'seven quarters', 'longest streak', '2008 financial crisis', 'safe pair', 'turbulent waters', 'new CEOs', 'Luke Meynell', 'European boards', 'women', 'London', 'females', 'Britain', 'boardrooms', 'Experts', 'advances', 'C-suite', 'progress', 'defence', 'landlords', 'England', 'change', 'people', 'improvement', 'Efforts', 'four', 'target', 'February', 'drive', 'campaign', 'response', 'signs', 'gigs', 'Euronext', 'hands', 'direction', 'businesses', 'realities', 'world', 'pandemic', 'inflation', 'row', 'result', 'bid', 'finances', 'Vodafone', 'Diageo']",2023-07-24,2023-07-25,cityam.com

This performance enabled to achieve a revenue level close to last year's in the 1st half despite an unfavorable base effect. The efforts made in 2023 will allow Prodways to release its growth levers in 2024  for which the Group is starting to get positive signals in all activities  such as the rising consumption of 3D materials.Revenues by division(in € million) Q2 2023 Q2 2022 Variation(%) Organic variation(%) H1 2023 H1 2022 Variation(%) Organic variation(%) Systems 12.1 11.0 +10% +10% 24.1 26.6 -9% -9% Products 9.4 7.9 +19% +6% 19.1 15.3 +25% +12% Structure & intra-group eliminations -0.1 -0.1 n.a n.a -0.1 -0.2 n.a n.a Consolidated revenues 21.5 18.9 +14% +8% 43.1 41.6 +4% -1%Revenues for the 2nd quarter and 1st half of 2023 stand at a good level given the return to a more normal seasonal pattern at the start of the year[1]. Overall  the activity in the 2nd quarter was sustained across all activites  with a large number of actions deployed as part of the BOOST development plan which will only produce their full effects next year.These actions focused on:Industrial projects for mass production   with various world-class players in industrial and the medical sectors evaluating Prodways 3D printers and 3D materials.  with various world-class players in industrial and the medical sectors evaluating Prodways 3D printers and 3D materials. 3D materials framework contracts with existing customers  who are planning their 2024 production with increasing material consumption.with existing customers  who are planning their 2024 production with increasing material consumption.

The reinforcement of sales teams   with recruitments and major changes in order to increase the reach and quality of execution in this area.  with recruitments and major changes in order to increase the reach and quality of execution in this area. The start of geographic expansion of certain activities  notably in Software  which will enable us to serve new customers in additive manufacturing.Systems Division: robust revenues generated from 3D materials  but delay in orders for new 3D printersRevenues for the Systems division (which includes sales of 3D printers  3D Materials and 3D Software) rose by 10% this quarter compared with the second quarter 2022. Sales were driven by both recurring revenues generated by 3D Materials and the commercialization of 3D Software. This latter activity once again experienced a change in seasonality this half-year  albeit on a smaller scale than last year  with revenues realized in anticipation in the second quarter (of the order of €1 million transferred from the second half to the second quarter).However  the level of printer orders was penalized by the postponement of customer investments in new industrial projects. As a result  deliveries of new 3D printers  as well as sales of materials associated with these new printers  have been revised downwards for 2023  impacting revenue forecasts for the year (a dedicated press release was issued on this subject in June 2023).Printer orders have also been impacted by the concentration of sales efforts on key accounts  as illustrated by two recent orders for emblematic industrial customers (link to dedicated press release). These two orders involve a single printer each and small volumes of materials at this stage  but represent key milestones in the penetration of 3D printing for large-scale series production.Products Division: rising volumes and customer numbersThe Products division  which includes Digital Manufacturing (print-on-demand service) and Integrated Businesses (essentially the manufacture of custom parts for the audiology sector)  has enjoyed good momentum since the start of the year  with growth of +19% in the second quarter of 2023.The Digital Manufacturing business continues to make structural progress  gaining around a hundred new customers since the start of the year  while increasing the average volume of orders per customer thanks to growth in small series. Revenue growth in this business  at +9% for the second quarter and +17% for the first half as a whole  came from a wide range of industrial sectors.In the manufacture of custom parts for audiology  the integration of Auditech is now complete  with the pooling of production tools and sales channels. Growth of more than +30% this quarter testifies to Prodways' growing market share in the supply of custom hearing protection for all types of industrial customers. Revenue growth  already high  is however limited by an ongoing industrial optimization project to increase production capacity to meet growing demand from new clients. The effects of the new industrial organization should be felt as early as next year.Outlook: positive signals for 2024Despite the downward revision of the 2023 outlook during this year of preparation and transition  the various actions deployed internally and with the Group's customers since the beginning of the year lead Prodways to share its confidence in the future growth trajectory. The major industrial projects currently under negotiation are progressing well  with a number of successful technical assessments enabling to reach milestones. In the event of new large commercial success  some of this work could turn into orders towards the end of 2023 or the beginning of 2024  with several dozen orders for MovingLight® printers at stake  associated with significant volumes of 3D materials.3D material consumption signals are also positive for existing customers. Several of the Group's major customers have already announced their intention to increase their consumption through framework contracts for growing deliveries of materials in 2024.Geographic expansion of the 3D Software business began in Germany and the UK in the first half of this year  enabling Prodways to address a new fabric of industrial SMEs in its coverage area for 3D printers and print-on-demand services.Activities with shorter sales cycles are currently gearing up to increase their production capacity by 2024  and to keep pace with the trend towards greater customer numbers  which should be reinforced by the revitalization of sales teams. The Digital Manufacturing business acquired a new printer this quarter  and the Audiology business is optimizing the organization of end-user impressions and production workflows. The forthcoming arrival of a new sales manager will also enable this division to extend its sales scope beyond France.The performance of the second half of 2023 confirms the revenue and profitability outlook recently communicated for 2023  of around +5% revenue growth and around 8% current EBITDA margin. It also comforts Prodways' ability to bounce back in 2024 and achieve its ambition of reaching €200 million in revenues and a minimum current EBITDA margin of 15% by 2028.Next financial eventsSeptember 20  2023: half-yearly results 2023October 16  2023: activity of the third quarter 2023About Prodways GroupProdways Group is a specialist in industrial and professional 3D printing with a unique positioning as an integrated European player.

The campaign features the current F1® world champion and Heineken® 0.0 ambassador  Max Verstappen  who brings his star power to help promote responsible drinking to new and relevant audiences.HEINEKEN® LAUNCH NEW GLOBAL ‘WHEN YOU DRIVE  NEVER DRINK’ CREATIVE CAMPAIGN  ‘THE BEST DRIVER’  FEATURING F1® WORLD CHAMPION AND HEINEKEN® 0.0 AMBASSADOR  MAX VERSTAPPEN HEINEKEN® LAUNCH NEW GLOBAL ‘WHEN YOU DRIVE  NEVER DRINK’ CREATIVE CAMPAIGN  ‘THE BEST DRIVER’  FEATURING F1® WORLD CHAMPION AND HEINEKEN® 0.0 AMBASSADOR  MAX VERSTAPPENIn the new campaign  the Oracle Red Bull Racing driver is portrayed socialising with friends and repeatedly being chosen to take on the role of designated driver  due to him being 'The Best Driver'. The hero film cleverly emphasises that while some of the best drivers are from the world of F1® the decision should instead only be based on who hasn't had a drink… unless of course the drink is a Heineken® 0.0.The creative took inspiration from new research highlighting some of the arbitrary reasons for selecting a designated driver; including driving experience  enjoyment  or simply the person who volunteers[1]. Through this new campaign Heineken® aims to highlight that when it comes to getting a ride home after a night out the only person chosen to get behind the wheel should be the one that hasn't had alcohol.Max Verstappen said: ""As an F1® driver  making the right choices both on and off the track is vitally important for success. When driving  having that clarity and single-mindedness  particularly when it comes to safety  is crucial. On top of working on an upcoming  exciting new gaming initiative with Heineken® called Player 0.0  I'm proud as a Heineken® 0.0 ambassador to help advocate responsible drinking to motorsport fans all over the world. The campaign was great fun to shoot and I hope everyone not only enjoys the film  but also takes away the important message behind it.""Bram Westenbrink  Global Head of Heineken® Brand said: ""When You Drive Never Drink is a message we are very passionate about  and continues to be at the forefront of our long standing partnership with F1®. As the racing season begins to heat up over the summer months  we are excited to launch the latest phase of this campaign which we first kicked off in 2016. As we enjoy the incredible action on track  it's important to remember that when it comes to choosing a designated driver when out with friends – 'The Best Driver' is always the one that hasn't been drinking.""The new campaign  ideated and created by creative agency Le Pub  directed by Bradley & Pablo and produced by PRETTYBIRD  launched in the Netherlands today through social media and digital out-of-home platforms. The hero film and supporting digital assets will also be launching across online  social and digital OOH  with the campaign rolling out globally across the rest of 2023.Bruno Bertelli  Global CEO LePub  Global CCO Publicis Worldwide  CCO Publicis Groupe Italy  said: ""Heineken® continues to be a pivotal player when it comes to responsible consumption. In its own witty way  the brand has always been culturally aware and sensitive towards global issues and younger generations. ""When You Drive Never Drink"" is in fact a long-standing project and consistent brand pillar that Heineken® can boast and champion. Drinking and driving pose significant risks and consequences  and who better than one of the most globally renowned drivers to convey this key message? Max Verstappen has been thus enlisted  becoming the most prominent promoter of safe rides. This approach treats in a creative way the brand's commitment towards building an impressive platform that exemplifies brand equity and impact at scale.""Since entering the world of motorsport in 2016  Heineken® has been committed to real change around attitudes towards drink driving  continuing to innovate through their marketing campaigns with F1®. The brand consistently drives the message in a light-hearted way through their global 'When You Drive  Never Drink' campaigns  with new creative launched every season.

the ability of aircraft to fly over a country - during national ATC strikes following recent industrial action in France.Last week  EasyJet blamed 'unprecedented ATC disruption' for cancelling around 1 700 summer flights  affecting more than 180 000 passengers as a result.Both EasyJet and Ryanair are continuing to operate flights as normal to wildfire-ravage Rhodes despite other airlines cancelling all holiday travel to the island.Due to the fires  shares in London-listed air carriers and travel firms slipped lower on Monday morning  with Wizz Air Holdings shares down 3.9 per cent to £25.64  EasyJet shares 2.65 per cent lower at 463.4p and TUI shares 2.4 per cent down at 594.5p  making them among the top ten largest FTSE 250 fallers.Ryanair shares were 2.8 per cent lower at €15.98 on the Euronext Dublin exchange.Danni Hewson  head of financial analysis at AJ Bell  said: 'Reports of holidaymakers having to leave hotels and sleep in sports halls or on the street could cause others to think twice about booking last-minute breaks  for fear they too could get caught up in the chaos.'Falling share prices for the likes of Jet2  EasyJet and TUI suggest investors are worried that they won't achieve near-term earnings forecasts and they will potentially incur extra costs for having to run repatriation flights to bring customers home.',neutral,0.05,0.75,0.2,mixed,0.13,0.24,0.63,True,English,"['traffic forecasts', 'Ryanair', 'wildfires', 'airlines', 'inefficient ATC [Air Traffic Control] system', 'French air traffic controllers', 'up to two months', 'The Irish low-cost airline', 'Wizz Air Holdings shares', '300 new Boeing 737-Max-10 aircraft', 'record passenger traffic', 'national ATC strikes', 'unprecedented ATC disruption', 'Higher average airfares', 'President Emmanuel Macron', 'controversial pension reforms', 'annual passenger outlook', 'supply chain difficulties', 'annual passenger numbers', ""Michael O'Leary"", 'rising mortgage rates', 'unnecessary CO2 emissions', 'recent industrial action', 'Euronext Dublin exchange', 'near-term earnings forecasts', 'current summer season', 'Falling share prices', 'jet fuel costs', 'Budget airline Ryanair', 'air carrier', 'new aircraft', 'three months', 'list prices', 'extra costs', 'aircraft shipments', '1,700 summer flights', 'first quarter', 'expected growth', '290 per cent', 'bumper Easter', 'Strong performance', 'ancillary sales', 'operating expenses', '50 million people', 'expansion plan', 'shareholder approval', 'older 737NGs', 'Dublin-based group', 'chief executive', 'living pressures', 'fare stimulation', 'seat capacity', 'urgent reform', 'flight times', 'European Commission', 'wildfire-ravage Rhodes', 'other airlines', 'holiday travel', 'travel firms', 'Monday morning', 'largest FTSE 250', 'Danni Hewson', 'financial analysis', 'AJ Bell', 'sports halls', 'last-minute breaks', 'Ryanair shares', '3,200 daily flights', 'repatriation flights', 'company poll', 'London-listed rivals', '600,000 daily customers', 'flight delays', 'weaker demand', 'Ryanair profits', 'June', 'analysts', 'Trading', 'May', 'update', 'potential', 'concerns', 'impact', 'wildfires', 'continent', 'revenue', 'rise', 'More', 'period', 'hundreds', '51 jets', 'end', 'April', 'July', 'order', 'part', 'goal', 'biggest', 'schedule', 'call', 'overflights', 'ability', 'country', 'France', 'EasyJet', '180,000 passengers', 'result', 'island', 'TUI', 'top', 'head', 'Reports', 'holidaymakers', 'hotels', 'street', 'others', 'fear', 'chaos', 'likes', 'investors']",2023-07-24,2023-07-25,thisismoney.co.uk

Dubbed ""Pearlflex""  this new product will be available from September 2023  notably for the Extime JCDecaux Airport advertising sites at the Paris-Charles de Gaulle and Paris-Orly airports  as well as other French airports. This solution offers a number of advantages over current practices  including a reduced carbon footprint and optimised end-of-life treatment. This high-tech product also guarantees excellent image quality.This new fabric is the result of co-development between two experts in their sector: JCDecaux is present in 153 airports worldwide and offers a complete and innovative range of media solutions for brands  combining bespoke formats  digital screens and event solutions. Senfa  a subsidiary of Chargeurs PCC Fashion technologies (Chargeurs group)  is a recognised French manufacturer based in Sélestat  Alsace  and a leading expert in technical textiles for the visual communication  interior architecture and custom textile development markets.The new fabric is made in France via 100% European sourcing. The weave is made from recycled PET yarns. The solvents used for PVC are replaced by aqueous coating of the fabric  carried out in Sélestat. Finally  the fabric offers an improved end-of-life treatment  with energy recovery in the form of solid recovered fuel. Thanks to this new material and manufacturing process  the carbon footprint of Pearlflex fabric is more than halved compared with current fabrics  thereby contributing to the 2050 Net Zero Carbon objective  announced last June by JCDecaux.Available from 1 September 2023  these canvases will be gradually deployed across the majority of Extime JCDecaux Airport advertising sites.Michaël Fribourg  Chairman and CEO of Chargeurs group  said: ""The launch of Pearlflex  which responds to a global demand in the visual communications market  reflects the shared vision of the Chargeurs and JCDecaux groups for sustainable innovation. Pearlflex offers our two groups additional commercial opportunities to serve brands by combining visual and environmental excellence. By placing its trust in Chargeurs and its Senfa subsidiary  JCDecaux has chosen a partner with an international outreach  and a world leader in high-end print media with a long-term commitment to France and Europe.""Jean-Charles Decaux  Co-CEO of JCDecaux: ""We are delighted to have co-developed this new canvas with the Chargeurs group  whose expertise in high-tech print materials is second to none. As part of our company's commitment to an ambitious Climate Plan  we are deploying new solutions that combine quality and sustainability throughout our value chain. Pearlflex is a perfect example of this  and we look forward to bringing it to our airport advertising customers from September  helping them deploy impactful and responsible communications.

The decrease reflected softening market conditions  and push-outs in logic/foundry as earlier indicated with the Q1 2023 report.Year-on-year revenue growth for the second quarter 2023 was 21% at constant currencies (20% as reported).Normalized gross profit margin of 49.0%  excluding PPA expenses in the second quarter 2023  improved compared to 47.5% in the same quarter last year  mainly explained by mix.Normalized operating result for the second quarter 2023  excluding PPA expenses  improved from €148 million last year to €180 million this year due to strong revenue growth and higher gross margin.Net earnings included a negative impact of €9 million (net of tax) relating to PPA expenses. Normalized net earnings for the second quarter 2023 were €161 million  down from €164 million in Q2 last year  and included a translation gain of €8 million compared to a translation gain of €26 million in Q2 2022 and a translation loss of €7 million in Q1 2023.Details of (estimated) amortization and earn-out expenses (PPA expenses) relating to the 2022 acquisitions of LPE and Reno are found in Annex 2.Story continuesComment“Against a backdrop of slowing market conditions  ASM delivered a resilient performance in the second quarter ” said Benjamin Loh  President and CEO of ASM. “Revenue increased 21% at constant currencies compared to prior year to €669 million  in line with our previous guidance of €650-690 million. The gross margin improved year on year but decreased compared to the exceptionally high level in Q1 and amounted to a solid level of 49% in Q2  with a positive mix  and including again a relatively increased contribution from the Chinese market. Despite higher investments in R&D  and supported by the increased revenue  the operating result increased 23% at constant currencies to €180 million. As communicated previously  we still expect operating margin for the full year of 2023 to be 26% or slightly lower  explained by the expected lower sales level in the second half. We generated €86 million in free cash flow in Q2. We used €123 million in cash for the dividend payment  and €50 million for share repurchases.Orders dropped by 48% to €486 million in Q2. The lower order intake in Q2 was impacted by softening demand  and  as indicated with our Q1 results  by push-outs in leading-edge logic/foundry  reflecting softer end-market conditions and some delays in new customer fab readiness. In addition  the decrease in order intake also reflected some further normalization of the backlog compared to the relatively elevated level in 2022  following improved supply chain conditions.Demand in the memory market continued to be weak in Q2 and is not expected to recover in the remainder of the year. Logic/foundry orders dropped in Q2. Despite the near-term market softening  ASM remains well positioned for the next nodes. As our logic/foundry customers are preparing for the transition to gate-all-around (GAA) device technology we are confident that this transition will drive a meaningful double-digit increase in served available markets  with continued ALD leadership for ASM and opportunities for share gains in silicon Epi. We continue to expect a first meaningful contribution from GAA pilot-line orders in Q4 2023.Demand in the mature node markets remained solid in Q2. For our company  these markets are a smaller part of revenue and mainly a selective play in the power  analog and wafer manufacturer segments. Combined with solid momentum of new product introductions  such as our Sonora vertical furnace  we expect solid growth in this part of our business this year.Our silicon carbide Epi business increased substantially in Q2 and remains on track to achieve more than €130 million in sales in 2023. Since we acquired LPE last year  customer engagements have increased significantly. After winning a new leading North American customer earlier this year  we have received a first order from a major European SiC player.”OutlookOn a currency-comparable level  we project revenue of €580-620 million for Q3. As already communicated with our Q1 results  we expect Q3 orders will also show a drop compared to the level in Q1  albeit not as pronounced as in Q2. Our forecast for the second half is unchanged  we still expect a decrease in revenue of 10% or more compared to the first half of the year  based on the current visibility and at constant currencies. For FY 2023  we still expect revenue to show year-on-year a single-digit percentage increase  at constant currencies and including the consolidation of LPE.Wafer fab equipment (WFE) is now expected to drop by a mid-to-high-teens percentage in 2023. Memory WFE is expected to show the sharpest drop and leading-edge logic/foundry is impacted by push-outs and weaker market conditions  while the trend in mature node spending remains more positive. We expect to again outperform the WFE market this year.Share buyback programOn April 25  2023  ASM announced the start of the €100 million share buyback program. As of June 30  2023  50.1% of the share buyback program was completed at an average share price of €361.26.Investor DayWe will host our 2023 Investor Day on September 26.

The European built and hosted SaaS-platform guarantees full data privacy protection in line with the EU GDPR regulation.TradeLog provides companies with a detailed view of their employees’ transactions and holdings and allows them to gather employees’ consents to policies in one place. It also helps companies avoid wasting valuable time manually checking each individual’s prospective trade. The system checks whether each trade is in line with internal policies and regulations in order to pre-clear the trade.Finally  in selected geographies  TradeLog can also connect to custody accounts and automatically monitor employees’ trading. This model has been successfully implemented in Denmark and Norway  through Euronext’s own Central Securities Depositories  Euronext Securities Copenhagen and Euronext Securities Oslo.MiFID II requires firms to implement effective organisational and administrative internal policies and procedures to identify  prevent  manage  and disclose conflicts of interest by monitoring the share dealings of employees and requiring pre-clearance. The MAR regulation  which applies in the European Union  aims to protect investors by creating a standardised framework across EU members that helps prevent market abuse and thus encourages market activity.Richard Waller  Managing Director at ComplyLog  a Euronext Company  said: “Today  we make TradeLog available to all our clients across Europe. TradeLog is the perfect example of how the combination of our different capabilities across Euronext can solve our customers’ problems: it was developed by Euronext Securities - the Group’s Central Securities Depository business - and will now be scaled across Europe by Euronext Corporate Services. Two years after its successful launch in Denmark and Norway  we are thrilled to offer this innovative product to more corporates and financial institutions in Europe.
