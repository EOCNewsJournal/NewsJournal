A highly regarded industry leader  his expertise and international experience in clearing and financial infrastructure will be of great benefit to LME Clear as we evolve and drive forward our business and markets in a dynamic macro landscape.”The London Metal Exchange has been at the centre of controversy after it suspended trading on 8 March last year  when prices hit record highs of $100 000 per ton  driven by a failed short attempt by Chinese billionaire and Tsingshan Holdings owner Xiang Guangda.It then later decided to cancel eight hours of trades worth a combined sum of $3.9bn  as it determined prices no longer reflected market conditions.This decision triggered lawsuits from two investors who heavily lost out from the decision – Elliott Investment Management and Jane Street – worth a collective £360m.Their cases were heard in court last month  with a verdict expected in the autumn.The Bank of England has also confirmed LME Clear will face supervisory action following its own review of last March’s events  with a representative reporting back to the institution to ensure the clearing house is taking agreed steps to improve its risk management capabilities.,neutral,0.04,0.87,0.09,mixed,0.29,0.15,0.55,True,English,"['London Metal Exchange', 'new chief executive', 'court verdict', 'clearing', 'house', 'The London Metal Exchange', 'Belgian financial services group', 'dynamic macro landscape', 'Tsingshan Holdings owner', 'Elliott Investment Management', 'risk management capabilities', 'chief information officer', 'chief operations officer', 'various senior roles', 'interim chief executive', 'new chief executive', 'next long-term appointment', 'The Bank', 'oldest exchange', 'financial infrastructure', 'new role', 'senior team', 'Euroclear Group', 'LME Group', 'last year', 'nickel crisis', 'fresh changes', 'securities transaction', 'last 15 years', 'James Cressy', 'top table', 'legal counsel', 'industry leader', 'great benefit', 'record highs', 'short attempt', 'Chinese billionaire', 'Xiang Guangda', 'eight hours', 'combined sum', 'market conditions', 'two investors', 'Jane Street', 'supervisory action', 'Euroclear Sweden', 'Euroclear Finland', 'Euroclear UK', 'LME Clear', 'David Warren', 'international experience', 'last March', 'clearing house', 'court verdict', 'Michael Carty', '8 March', 'centre', 'controversy', 'world', 'continent', '2 October', 'raft', 'moves', 'organisation', 'chair', 'board', 'replacement', 'expertise', 'business', 'markets', 'trading', 'prices', 'ton', 'trades', 'decision', 'lawsuits', 'collective £', 'cases', 'autumn', 'England', 'review', 'events', 'representative', 'institution', 'steps']",2023-07-25,2023-07-26,cityam.com

The European built and hosted SaaS-platform guarantees full data privacy protection in line with the EU GDPR regulation.TradeLog provides companies with a detailed view of their employees’ transactions and holdings and allows them to gather employees’ consents to policies in one place. It also helps companies avoid wasting valuable time manually checking each individual’s prospective trade. The system checks whether each trade is in line with internal policies and regulations in order to pre-clear the trade.Finally  in selected geographies  TradeLog can also connect to custody accounts and automatically monitor employees’ trading. This model has been successfully implemented in Denmark and Norway  through Euronext’s own Central Securities Depositories  Euronext Securities Copenhagen and Euronext Securities Oslo.MiFID II requires firms to implement effective organisational and administrative internal policies and procedures to identify  prevent  manage  and disclose conflicts of interest by monitoring the share dealings of employees and requiring pre-clearance. The MAR regulation  which applies in the European Union  aims to protect investors by creating a standardised framework across EU members that helps prevent market abuse and thus encourages market activity.Richard Waller  Managing Director at ComplyLog  a Euronext Company  said: “Today  we make TradeLog available to all our clients across Europe.

The decrease reflected softening market conditions  and push-outs in logic/foundry as earlier indicated with the Q1 2023 report.Year-on-year revenue growth for the second quarter 2023 was 21% at constant currencies (20% as reported).Normalized gross profit margin of 49.0%  excluding PPA expenses in the second quarter 2023  improved compared to 47.5% in the same quarter last year  mainly explained by mix.Normalized operating result for the second quarter 2023  excluding PPA expenses  improved from €148 million last year to €180 million this year due to strong revenue growth and higher gross margin.Net earnings included a negative impact of €9 million (net of tax) relating to PPA expenses. Normalized net earnings for the second quarter 2023 were €161 million  down from €164 million in Q2 last year  and included a translation gain of €8 million compared to a translation gain of €26 million in Q2 2022 and a translation loss of €7 million in Q1 2023.Details of (estimated) amortization and earn-out expenses (PPA expenses) relating to the 2022 acquisitions of LPE and Reno are found in Annex 2.Comment“Against a backdrop of slowing market conditions  ASM delivered a resilient performance in the second quarter ” said Benjamin Loh  President and CEO of ASM. “Revenue increased 21% at constant currencies compared to prior year to €669 million  in line with our previous guidance of €650-690 million. The gross margin improved year on year but decreased compared to the exceptionally high level in Q1 and amounted to a solid level of 49% in Q2  with a positive mix  and including again a relatively increased contribution from the Chinese market. Despite higher investments in R&D  and supported by the increased revenue  the operating result increased 23% at constant currencies to €180 million. As communicated previously  we still expect operating margin for the full year of 2023 to be 26% or slightly lower  explained by the expected lower sales level in the second half. We generated €86 million in free cash flow in Q2. We used €123 million in cash for the dividend payment  and €50 million for share repurchases.Orders dropped by 48% to €486 million in Q2. The lower order intake in Q2 was impacted by softening demand  and  as indicated with our Q1 results  by push-outs in leading-edge logic/foundry  reflecting softer end-market conditions and some delays in new customer fab readiness. In addition  the decrease in order intake also reflected some further normalization of the backlog compared to the relatively elevated level in 2022  following improved supply chain conditions.Demand in the memory market continued to be weak in Q2 and is not expected to recover in the remainder of the year. Logic/foundry orders dropped in Q2. Despite the near-term market softening  ASM remains well positioned for the next nodes. As our logic/foundry customers are preparing for the transition to gate-all-around (GAA) device technology we are confident that this transition will drive a meaningful double-digit increase in served available markets  with continued ALD leadership for ASM and opportunities for share gains in silicon Epi. We continue to expect a first meaningful contribution from GAA pilot-line orders in Q4 2023.Demand in the mature node markets remained solid in Q2. For our company  these markets are a smaller part of revenue and mainly a selective play in the power  analog and wafer manufacturer segments. Combined with solid momentum of new product introductions  such as our Sonora vertical furnace  we expect solid growth in this part of our business this year.Our silicon carbide Epi business increased substantially in Q2 and remains on track to achieve more than €130 million in sales in 2023. Since we acquired LPE last year  customer engagements have increased significantly. After winning a new leading North American customer earlier this year  we have received a first order from a major European SiC player.”OutlookOn a currency-comparable level  we project revenue of €580-620 million for Q3. As already communicated with our Q1 results  we expect Q3 orders will also show a drop compared to the level in Q1  albeit not as pronounced as in Q2. Our forecast for the second half is unchanged  we still expect a decrease in revenue of 10% or more compared to the first half of the year  based on the current visibility and at constant currencies. For FY 2023  we still expect revenue to show year-on-year a single-digit percentage increase  at constant currencies and including the consolidation of LPE.Wafer fab equipment (WFE) is now expected to drop by a mid-to-high-teens percentage in 2023. Memory WFE is expected to show the sharpest drop and leading-edge logic/foundry is impacted by push-outs and weaker market conditions  while the trend in mature node spending remains more positive. We expect to again outperform the WFE market this year.Share buyback programOn April 25  2023  ASM announced the start of the €100 million share buyback program. As of June 30  2023  50.1% of the share buyback program was completed at an average share price of €361.26.Investor DayWe will host our 2023 Investor Day on September 26.

VIB is an independent research institute where some 1 800 top scientists from Belgium and abroad conduct pioneering basic research. As such  they are pushing the boundaries of what we know about molecular mechanisms and how they rule living organisms such as human beings  animals  plants  and microorganisms. Based on a close partnership with five Flemish universities – Ghent University  KU Leuven  University of Antwerp  Vrije Universiteit Brussel  and Hasselt University – and supported by a solid funding program  VIB unites the expertise of all its collaborators and research groups in a single institute. VIB’s technology transfer activities translate research results into concrete benefits for society such as new diagnostics and therapies and agricultural innovations. These applications are often developed by young start-ups from VIB or through collaborations with other companies.

The decrease reflected softening market conditions  and push-outs in logic/foundry as earlier indicated with the Q1 2023 report.Year-on-year revenue growth for the second quarter 2023 was 21% at constant currencies (20% as reported).Normalized gross profit margin of 49.0%  excluding PPA expenses in the second quarter 2023  improved compared to 47.5% in the same quarter last year  mainly explained by mix.Normalized operating result for the second quarter 2023  excluding PPA expenses  improved from €148 million last year to €180 million this year due to strong revenue growth and higher gross margin.Net earnings included a negative impact of €9 million (net of tax) relating to PPA expenses. Normalized net earnings for the second quarter 2023 were €161 million  down from €164 million in Q2 last year  and included a translation gain of €8 million compared to a translation gain of €26 million in Q2 2022 and a translation loss of €7 million in Q1 2023.Details of (estimated) amortization and earn-out expenses (PPA expenses) relating to the 2022 acquisitions of LPE and Reno are found in Annex 2.Comment“Against a backdrop of slowing market conditions  ASM delivered a resilient performance in the second quarter ” said Benjamin Loh  President and CEO of ASM. “Revenue increased 21% at constant currencies compared to prior year to €669 million  in line with our previous guidance of €650-690 million. The gross margin improved year on year but decreased compared to the exceptionally high level in Q1 and amounted to a solid level of 49% in Q2  with a positive mix  and including again a relatively increased contribution from the Chinese market. Despite higher investments in R&D  and supported by the increased revenue  the operating result increased 23% at constant currencies to €180 million. As communicated previously  we still expect operating margin for the full year of 2023 to be 26% or slightly lower  explained by the expected lower sales level in the second half. We generated €86 million in free cash flow in Q2. We used €123 million in cash for the dividend payment  and €50 million for share repurchases.Orders dropped by 48% to €486 million in Q2. The lower order intake in Q2 was impacted by softening demand  and  as indicated with our Q1 results  by push-outs in leading-edge logic/foundry  reflecting softer end-market conditions and some delays in new customer fab readiness. In addition  the decrease in order intake also reflected some further normalization of the backlog compared to the relatively elevated level in 2022  following improved supply chain conditions.Demand in the memory market continued to be weak in Q2 and is not expected to recover in the remainder of the year. Logic/foundry orders dropped in Q2. Despite the near-term market softening  ASM remains well positioned for the next nodes. As our logic/foundry customers are preparing for the transition to gate-all-around (GAA) device technology we are confident that this transition will drive a meaningful double-digit increase in served available markets  with continued ALD leadership for ASM and opportunities for share gains in silicon Epi. We continue to expect a first meaningful contribution from GAA pilot-line orders in Q4 2023.Demand in the mature node markets remained solid in Q2. For our company  these markets are a smaller part of revenue and mainly a selective play in the power  analog and wafer manufacturer segments. Combined with solid momentum of new product introductions  such as our Sonora vertical furnace  we expect solid growth in this part of our business this year.Our silicon carbide Epi business increased substantially in Q2 and remains on track to achieve more than €130 million in sales in 2023. Since we acquired LPE last year  customer engagements have increased significantly. After winning a new leading North American customer earlier this year  we have received a first order from a major European SiC player.”OutlookOn a currency-comparable level  we project revenue of €580-620 million for Q3. As already communicated with our Q1 results  we expect Q3 orders will also show a drop compared to the level in Q1  albeit not as pronounced as in Q2. Our forecast for the second half is unchanged  we still expect a decrease in revenue of 10% or more compared to the first half of the year  based on the current visibility and at constant currencies. For FY 2023  we still expect revenue to show year-on-year a single-digit percentage increase  at constant currencies and including the consolidation of LPE.Wafer fab equipment (WFE) is now expected to drop by a mid-to-high-teens percentage in 2023. Memory WFE is expected to show the sharpest drop and leading-edge logic/foundry is impacted by push-outs and weaker market conditions  while the trend in mature node spending remains more positive. We expect to again outperform the WFE market this year.Share buyback programOn April 25  2023  ASM announced the start of the €100 million share buyback program. As of June 30  2023  50.1% of the share buyback program was completed at an average share price of €361.26.Investor DayWe will host our 2023 Investor Day on September 26.

Inside information.Mechelen  July 25  2023 - Telenet Group Holding NV (""Telenet"" or the ""Company"") (Euronext Brussels: TNET) announces its unaudited consolidated results under International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (""EU IFRS"") for the six months ended June 30  2023.HIGHLIGHTSSoft operational performance in Q2 2023  reflecting the combined impact of (i) the June 2023 price adjustment  (ii) temporary IT system issues because of the migration of customers to our new IT platform  (iii) an overall intense competitive environment and (iv) a temporary halt to some of our marketing campaigns. As a result  our broadband and mobile postpaid RGU bases contracted by net 5 000 and 5 400 RGUs  respectively. Both our video and fixed-line telephony RGU base continued to decrease  mainly driven by macro trends and shifting consumer preferences.Continued FMC growth  reaching 839 900 FMC subscribers at June 30  2023  up 6% year-on-year and adding 5 500 net new FMC subscribers in Q2 2023.Revenue of €1 406.9 million in H1 2023  up 9% and 2% year-on-year on a reported and rebased(1)basis  respectively  driven by higher subscription and business services revenue. Top line growth in Q2 2023 retreated slightly relative to Q1 due to a lower contribution from our media franchise  having achieved 9% and 1% growth on a reported and rebased basis  respectively  to €704.1 million.In H1 2023  we incurred a net loss of €12.0 million  representing a significant decrease compared to the same period of last year when our €793.4 million net profit was favorably impacted by the gain related to the sale of our mobile infrastructure business to DigitalBridge in June last year.H1 2023 Adjusted EBITDA(2) of €677.0 million  up 1% and broadly stable year-on-year on a reported and rebased basis  respectively. Our Adjusted EBITDA in H1 and Q2 2023 included a €10.5 million decrease in costs associated with the one-time benefit from expected settlements of certain operational contingencies  as contemplated in our guidance. The latter also favorably impacted our Q2 2023 Adjusted EBITDA performance  up 4% on both a reported and rebased basis to €357.4 million.Adjusted EBITDAaL(2) of €619.1 million in H1 2023  +1% and +3% year-on-year on a reported and rebased basis  respectively (Q2 2023: €337.3 million  +7% and +9% on a reported and rebased basis  respectively). This reflected the same factors as those having impacted our H1 Adjusted EBITDA performance and also reflecting lower interest on the Fluvius lease as a result of the Wyre transaction.Accrued capital expenditures(3) of €356.7 million in H1 2023 (Q2 2023: €168.2 million). Excluding the recognition of certain football broadcasting rights and certain lease-related capital additions impacts  as per our guidance  our accrued capital expenditures were €342.2 million (Q2 2023: €166.3 million) or approximately 24% of revenue (Q2 2023: approximately 24% of revenue). Compared to last year  our capital intensity increased following higher investments in 5G and Fiber-to-the-Home.Adjusted EBITDA less property & equipment additions(4) of €334.8 million in H1 2023  -11% year-on-year as a result of increased capital intensity (Q2 2023: €191.1 million  up 2% year-on-year).Net cash from operating activities  net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities of €474.5 million  €297.2 million and €224.6 million  respectively  in H1 2023. Adjusted Free Cash Flow(5) of €102.5 million in H1 2023  -39% year-on-year due to (i) 17% higher cash capital expenditures as a result of our increased capital intensity as mentioned above  (ii) a negative trend in our working capital  (iii) higher payments for cash interest and cash derivatives compared to H1 last year and (iv) a €4.2 million lower contribution from our vendor financing program compared to H1 last year given phasing in some of our payments. In line with our FY 2023 outlook  we expect the trend in our Adjusted Free Cash Flow to significantly improve for the second half of the year  reconfirming our full year objective of around €250.0 million.Robust debt and liquidity profile characterized by (i) no debt maturities until March 2028  (ii) weighted average maturity of 5.0 years  (iii) fully hedged debt profile with weighted average cost of debt (including hedges) of around 3.0% (see section 2.8)  (iv) full access to €645.0 million of untapped liquidity under our revolving credit facilities  which represents a net €90.0 million increase relative to March 31  2023 and (v) €1 017.1 million of cash and cash equivalents at June 30  2023.",neutral,0.01,0.97,0.01,mixed,0.31,0.39,0.29,True,English,"['First Half 2023 Results', 'Telenet', 'fixed-line telephony RGU base', 'mobile postpaid RGU bases', 'International Financial Reporting Standards', 'Telenet Group Holding NV', 'temporary IT system issues', 'lease-related capital additions impacts', '5,500 net new FMC subscribers', 'Q2 2023 Adjusted EBITDA performance', 'H1 Adjusted EBITDA performance', '17% higher cash capital expenditures', 'new IT platform', 'mobile infrastructure business', 'Soft operational performance', 'unaudited consolidated results', 'intense competitive environment', 'football broadcasting rights', 'revolving credit facilities', 'accrued capital expenditures', 'vendor financing program', 'weighted average cost', 'Free Cash Flow', '€793.4 million net profit', 'net €90.0 million increase', 'million lower contribution', 'business services revenue', 'June 2023 price adjustment', 'Top line growth', 'full year objective', '839,900 FMC subscribers', 'financial instruments', 'temporary halt', 'equipment additions', '€10.5 million decrease', 'Net cash', 'FMC growth', 'capital intensity', 'working capital', 'higher subscription', 'operational contingencies', 'higher investments', 'financing activities', 'average maturity', 'full access', 'net loss', 'lower interest', 'cash interest', 'cash derivatives', 'cash equivalents', 'Royal Decree', 'regulated market', 'Euronext Brussels', 'European Union', 'EU IFRS', 'six months', 'combined impact', 'marketing campaigns', 'macro trends', 'consumer preferences', 'media franchise', 'rebased basis', 'significant decrease', 'same period', 'one-time benefit', 'expected settlements', 'same factors', 'Fluvius lease', 'Wyre transaction', 'less property', 'operating activities', 'investing activities', 'higher payments', 'FY 2023 outlook', 'second half', 'liquidity profile', 'untapped liquidity', 'Robust debt', 'debt maturities', 'debt profile', 'negative trend', 'last year', 'regulated information', '1% growth', '14 November', 'duties', 'issuers', 'trading', 'Mechelen', 'Company', 'TNET', 'HIGHLIGHTS', 'migration', 'customers', 'overall', 'broadband', '5,400 RGUs', 'video', 'Q1', 'gain', 'sale', 'DigitalBridge', 'costs', 'guidance', 'EBITDAaL', 'reported', 'recognition', '5G', 'Fiber', 'Home', 'phasing', 'March', '5.0 years', 'hedges', 'section', '5,000']",2023-07-25,2023-07-26,marketscreener.com

It puts the group on target to exceed the symbolic milestone of €1 billion in revenue before the end of 2023.Revenue by regionIn France  second-quarter revenue in 2023 amounted to €97.8 million compared to €105.2 million a year earlier  a more modest decline when comparing with the first quarter.Connectivity Solutions generated revenue of €69.7 million  down 7% compared to the second quarter of 2022  as the market overall remains under pressure. The group has gained market share with its biggest customer  and as expected  revenue from this service provider is growing. However  this increase has not compensated for the overall slowdown in this market segment. Furthermore  the price reductions applied by some customers in 2022 have only been partially offset by negotiating price increases to adjust for inflation.The market now seems to be stabilizing with a volume of between 800 000 and 900 000 new subscribers per quarter  down compared to 2021 when this business peaked during the pandemic (950 000 to 1 150 000 new subscribers per quarter). The number of fiber subscribers reached 19 million by the end of March 2023  out of 34 million premises currently eligible for fiber.Revenue from Energy Solutions amounted to €9.8 million compared to €12.9 million the previous year  down 24%. This business remains impacted by the end of smart meter deployments in France  which only contributed revenue of €1.8 million over the period. The deployment pace of new activities—mainly related to B2B2C renewable energies and electric mobility—is still irregular which is typical during the start-up phase  as customers adjust their business model and operational processes. This has overshadowed the otherwise good performance of the B2B photovoltaic business. Efforts to strengthen the group’s ability to execute in this sector and to expand its offerings are bearing fruit  as shown by the upward trajectory of both sales and invoicing. The acquisition of ELEC ENR announced today is strategic for Solutions30 as it will give the group total coverage of France and a base of operations in the northeast. This part of the country is experiencing strong growth in the deployment of photovoltaic power plants  given the availability and accessibility of land. ELEC ENR’s recognized operational capabilities and quality management chain helped it reach €5.6 million in revenue by the end of 2022  in a region where Solutions30 has already signed €10 million worth of projects.Finally  Technology Solutions posted revenue of €18.3 million  up 4% over the quarter  driven by the increase in payment solution and security system installations  as well as related maintenance.Over the first six months of the year  revenue in France is down 10.1% to €199.4 million.In the Benelux  revenue in the second quarter of 2023 amounted to €97.1 million compared to €51.8 million a year earlier  representing organic growth of 87.7%.Revenue from Connectivity Solutions more than doubled to reach €77.8 million during the quarter  compared to €37.4 million in the second quarter of 2022. This very strong growth is essentially due to the rapid roll-out of fiber optics across the country and the group’s ability to keep up with much faster installation schedules than anticipated.Revenue from Energy Solutions was up 43% to €14.6 million  compared with €10.2 million a year earlier. This business is driven by the ongoing deployment of smart meters in Flanders and the start of new contracts related to new energies  electric mobility  and smart grids.Lastly  Technology Solutions posted revenue of €4.7 million  up 14%.Over the entire first half of 2023  revenue rose by 82.7% to €179.9 million.In all other countries  the group posted quarterly revenue of €68.5 million  compared to €64.8 million a year earlier  representing purely organic growth of 5.8%.In Germany  revenue amounted to €14.5 million compared to €15.1 million a year earlier. Fiber-optic deployments are expected to start in the second half of the year.In Italy  revenue amounted to €17.1 million in the second quarter of 2023  compared to €18.4 million one year earlier. The conditions under which ultra-fast broadband infrastructure deployments are being executed have deteriorated in recent months due to the national service provider’s recurring operational difficulties. The entire sector has been affected  and Solutions30 has decided to slow down the pace of call-outs until the situation returns to normal and a more efficient way of operating has been found  in agreement with its various partners.On the Iberian Peninsula  revenue amounted to €14.3 million compared to €14.5 million a year earlier. This market is generally stable  and the group is reorganizing its offering to focus on its most profitable businesses.In Poland  revenue amounted to €12.2 million  up an impressive 51%. The country continues to benefit from market share gains  in both fixed and mobile networks.Finally  in the United Kingdom  Solutions30 posted quarterly revenue of €10.5 million  up 21%  reflecting FTTH deployments in Greater London.In all these countries  the group posted revenue of €139.3 million for the first half of 2023  an increase of 12.3% (12.25% organic growth) compared to the first half of 2022.OutlookThe solid performance of the first six months confirms the group’s objective of double-digit growth in 2023 and that it is on target to exceed €1 billion in revenue before the end of the year.Meanwhile  the group continues to work on improving its margins  the effects of which will become apparent during the first half of the year. In France  operational and organizational efforts to restore margins and improve conditions for certain telecoms contracts are beginning to bear fruit. In the Benelux  strong growth and rapid ramp-ups could temporarily weigh on the EBITDA margin (EBITDA/Revenue)  but this margin will remain above 10%. Lastly  the situation in Italy will have an impact on EBITDA margins for other countries in the first half of the year  but the group-wide impact will be limited. In this context  the group confirms that its margins will gradually improve throughout the year  with a significantly higher consolidated EBITDA margin for the first half of the year compared with the second half of 2022.The group intends to pursue its strategy of focusing on organic growth to achieve a critical mass everywhere it operates  while working to improve profitability. The group will leverage the scale effects it expects from its booming markets  returning to dynamic and profitable growth over the long term. As illustrated by the acquisition of ELEC ENR  the group is open to external growth opportunities that will expand its coverage or complement its expertise in high-potential markets.Upcoming event2023 HY Earnings Report September 21  2023About Solutions30 SEThe Solutions30 group is the European leader in solutions for new technologies.

Furthermore  the price reductions applied by some customers in 2022 have only been partially offset by negotiating price increases to adjust for inflation.The market now seems to be stabilizing with a volume of between 800 000 and 900 000 new subscribers per quarter  down compared to 2021 when this business peaked during the pandemic (950 000 to 1 150 000 new subscribers per quarter). The number of fiber subscribers reached 19 million by the end of March 2023  out of 34 million premises currently eligible for fiber.Revenue from Energy Solutions amounted to €9.8 million compared to €12.9 million the previous year  down 24%. This business remains impacted by the end of smart meter deployments in France  which only contributed revenue of €1.8 million over the period. The deployment pace of new activities—mainly related to B2B2C renewable energies and electric mobility—is still irregular which is typical during the start-up phase  as customers adjust their business model and operational processes. This has overshadowed the otherwise good performance of the B2B photovoltaic business. Efforts to strengthen the group’s ability to execute in this sector and to expand its offerings are bearing fruit  as shown by the upward trajectory of both sales and invoicing. The acquisition of ELEC ENR announced today is strategic for Solutions30 as it will give the group total coverage of France and a base of operations in the northeast. This part of the country is experiencing strong growth in the deployment of photovoltaic power plants  given the availability and accessibility of land. ELEC ENR’s recognized operational capabilities and quality management chain helped it reach €5.6 million in revenue by the end of 2022  in a region where Solutions30 has already signed €10 million worth of projects.Finally  Technology Solutions posted revenue of €18.3 million  up 4% over the quarter  driven by the increase in payment solution and security system installations  as well as related maintenance.Over the first six months of the year  revenue in France is down 10.1% to €199.4 million.In the Benelux  revenue in the second quarter of 2023 amounted to €97.1 million compared to €51.8 million a year earlier  representing organic growth of 87.7%.Revenue from Connectivity Solutions more than doubled to reach €77.8 million during the quarter  compared to €37.4 million in the second quarter of 2022. This very strong growth is essentially due to the rapid roll-out of fiber optics across the country and the group’s ability to keep up with much faster installation schedules than anticipated.Revenue from Energy Solutions was up 43% to €14.6 million  compared with €10.2 million a year earlier. This business is driven by the ongoing deployment of smart meters in Flanders and the start of new contracts related to new energies  electric mobility  and smart grids.Lastly  Technology Solutions posted revenue of €4.7 million  up 14%.Over the entire first half of 2023  revenue rose by 82.7% to €179.9 million.In all other countries  the group posted quarterly revenue of €68.5 million  compared to €64.8 million a year earlier  representing purely organic growth of 5.8%.In Germany  revenue amounted to €14.5 million compared to €15.1 million a year earlier. Fiber-optic deployments are expected to start in the second half of the year.In Italy  revenue amounted to €17.1 million in the second quarter of 2023  compared to €18.4 million one year earlier. The conditions under which ultra-fast broadband infrastructure deployments are being executed have deteriorated in recent months due to the national service provider’s recurring operational difficulties. The entire sector has been affected  and Solutions30 has decided to slow down the pace of call-outs until the situation returns to normal and a more efficient way of operating has been found  in agreement with its various partners.On the Iberian Peninsula  revenue amounted to €14.3 million compared to €14.5 million a year earlier. This market is generally stable  and the group is reorganizing its offering to focus on its most profitable businesses.In Poland  revenue amounted to €12.2 million  up an impressive 51%. The country continues to benefit from market share gains  in both fixed and mobile networks.Finally  in the United Kingdom  Solutions30 posted quarterly revenue of €10.5 million  up 21%  reflecting FTTH deployments in Greater London.In all these countries  the group posted revenue of €139.3 million for the first half of 2023  an increase of 12.3% (12.25% organic growth) compared to the first half of 2022.OutlookThe solid performance of the first six months confirms the group’s objective of double-digit growth in 2023 and that it is on target to exceed €1 billion in revenue before the end of the year.Meanwhile  the group continues to work on improving its margins  the effects of which will become apparent during the first half of the year. In France  operational and organizational efforts to restore margins and improve conditions for certain telecoms contracts are beginning to bear fruit. In the Benelux  strong growth and rapid ramp-ups could temporarily weigh on the EBITDA margin (EBITDA/Revenue)  but this margin will remain above 10%. Lastly  the situation in Italy will have an impact on EBITDA margins for other countries in the first half of the year  but the group-wide impact will be limited. In this context  the group confirms that its margins will gradually improve throughout the year  with a significantly higher consolidated EBITDA margin for the first half of the year compared with the second half of 2022.The group intends to pursue its strategy of focusing on organic growth to achieve a critical mass everywhere it operates  while working to improve profitability. The group will leverage the scale effects it expects from its booming markets  returning to dynamic and profitable growth over the long term. As illustrated by the acquisition of ELEC ENR  the group is open to external growth opportunities that will expand its coverage or complement its expertise in high-potential markets.Upcoming event2023 HY Earnings Report September 21  2023About Solutions30 SEThe Solutions30 group is the European leader in solutions for new technologies.

This is reflecting contrasted performances between our three end markets. Decline in Mobile communications revenue has partially been compensated by the sustained growth of Automotive & Industrial and Smart devices revenue.Mobile communicationsIn the first quarter of FY’24  Mobile communications revenue reached 89 million Euros  a 43% decline at constant exchange rates compared to the first quarter of FY’23. This temporary drop in revenue  which is essentially reflecting a decrease in volumes  is due to a well-anticipated RF-SOI wafers inventory absorption by Soitec customers in the context of weaker smartphone sales across the world. As indicated by Soitec early April 2023  and confirmed at its Capital Markets Day in June 2023  this inventory correction is expected to last another quarter before growth in RF-SOI wafer sales resumes. RF-SOI will continue to be supported by a greater penetration of high-end smartphones with further adoption of 5G and Wi-Fi 6/6E/7 leading to a higher content of Soitec substrates per smartphone  but also by the deployment of 5G infrastructure.Sales of FD-SOI wafers dedicated to front end modules continued to benefit from a positive momentum.Sales of POI (Piezoelectric-on-Insulator) wafers dedicated to RF filters for 5G smartphones become a solid growth driver compared to FY’23. In addition  Soitec continues working with several customers on qualifying different design architectures.Automotive & IndustrialAutomotive & Industrial revenue reached 37 million Euros in the first quarter of FY’24  a 57% growth at constant exchange rates compared to the first quarter of FY’23. Growth essentially reflects a strong increase in volumes and  to a lesser extent  a positive price / mix effect.Sales to the automotive industry continue to be driven by the rise in semiconductor content embedded in the latest generations of vehicles  Soitec products addressing the rising demand for multimedia and infotainment  functional safety  autonomous and assisted driving  as well as engine electrification.Sales of Power-SOI wafers significantly increased compared to the first quarter of FY’23.Sales of FD-SOI wafers also reached a higher level than in the first quarter of FY’23.In addition  Automotive & Industrial sales continue to benefit from Soitec’s SmartSiCTM technology. Production ramp-up is expected in FY’25.Smart devicesSmart devices revenue reached 31 million Euros in the first quarter of FY’24  a 10% increase at constant exchange rates compared to the first quarter of FY’23  reflecting mainly higher volumes.Sales of products dedicated to Smart devices continue to be driven by more complex sensors  higher connectivity functionalities and embedded intelligence  leading to more powerful and efficient chips for Edge Artificial Intelligence  Image Sensors  and Data Centers that support the Cloud Infrastructure.Sales of FD-SOI wafers were much higher than in the first quarter of FY’23  supported by structural demand for Edge Computing devices across consumer and industrial sectors.Sales of Photonics-SOI wafers  providing high speed connectivity solutions for Artificial Intelligence in the Cloud  and sales of Imager-SOI wafers for 3D imaging applications  were both lower than in the first quarter of FY’23.FY’24 outlookSoitec confirms expecting FY’24 total revenue to be stable at constant exchange rates and perimeter as compared to FY’23 with H1’24 total revenue to decline by around -15% year-on-year. The strong inventory correction which was anticipated for products dedicated to smartphones radiofrequency applications did materialize in Q1’24 and should last another quarter before a strong acceleration expected in the second part of FY’24. On the other hand  strong demand continues to be expected throughout FY’24 for both Automotive & Industrial and Smart devices.Soitec also confirms FY’24 EBITDA1 margin2 to remain around 36%.# # #Analysts conference call to be held in English on Wednesday 26th July at 8:00 am CET.To listen this conference call  the audiocast is available live and in replay at the following address: https://channel.royalcast.com/soitec/#!/soitec/20230726_1# # #AgendaQ2’24 revenue and H1’24 results are due to be published together on November 15th  2023  after market close.# # #DisclaimerThis document is provided by Soitec (the “Company”) for information purposes only.The Company’s business operations and financial position are described in the Company’s 2022-2023 Universal Registration Document (which notably includes the 2022-2023 Annual Financial Report) which was filed on June 14  2023 with the French stock market authority (Autorité des Marchés Financiers  or AMF) under number D.23-0482.

The strong inventory correction which was anticipated for products dedicated to smartphones radiofrequency applications did materialize in Q1’24 and should last another quarter before a strong acceleration expected in the second part of FY’24. On the other hand  strong demand continues to be expected throughout FY’24 for both Automotive & Industrial and Smart devices.Soitec also confirms FY’24 EBITDA1 margin2 to remain around 36%.# # #Analysts conference call to be held in English on Wednesday 26th July at 8:00 am CET.To listen this conference call  the audiocast is available live and in replay at the following address: https://channel.royalcast.com/soitec/#!/soitec/20230726_1# # #AgendaQ2’24 revenue and H1’24 results are due to be published together on November 15th  2023  after market close.# # #DisclaimerThis document is provided by Soitec (the “Company”) for information purposes only.The Company’s business operations and financial position are described in the Company’s 2022-2023 Universal Registration Document (which notably includes the 2022-2023 Annual Financial Report) which was filed on June 14  2023 with the French stock market authority (Autorité des Marchés Financiers  or AMF) under number D.23-0482.

Thanks to the hard work and talent of our 12 000 employees  this growth is proving ever more profitable  while we continue investing in our technology assets. We are pressing ahead with our Beyond 22-25 strategic plan to further penetrate our markets  enhance the experience of our clients  partner merchants and users  and enrich our offering of increasingly relevant solutions.During the first half  we notably strengthened our position as the most trusted global Employee Benefits platform by acquiring Reward Gateway  which operates in the UK  Australia and the US  and GOintegro in Latin America. The acquisition of these two leading employee engagement platforms will enable us to provide HR departments with an even more comprehensive range of solutions  making their organizations more attractive so they can attract and retain top talent. We also plan to expand Reward Gateway’s coverage to a selection of key countries in Continental Europe.Lastly  thanks to the agility of our platform  we are starting to distribute third-party services  such as salary advance solutions  to better meet the expectations of a fast-changing world of work.After this strong first half  our outlook for the second half of the year is just as promising  as we target EBITDA of between €1 020 million and €1 090 million for full-year 2023.”FIRST-HALF 2023 RESULTSAt its meeting on July 24  2023  the Board of Directors reviewed the Group’s interim consolidated financial statements for the six months ended June 30  2023.Key financial metrics:(in € millions) First-half 2023 First-half 2022 % change (reported) % change(like-for-like) Operating revenue 1 081 891 +21.3% +20.0% Other revenue 82 31 +166.4% +185.2% Total revenue 1 163 922 +26.1% +25.5% EBITDA 483 365 +32.5% +35.2% EBIT 399 295 +35.2% +40.3% Net profit  Group share 202 170 +18.8%Total revenue: €1 163 millionTotal revenue for first-half 2023 amounted to €1 163 million  up 26.1% as reported compared with first-half 2022. This increase includes unfavorable currency effects (-2.0%) and a positive scope effect (+2.7%) mainly linked to the acquisition of Reward Gateway  consolidated since May 2023. On a like-for-like basis  total revenue was up 25.5%.In the second quarter  total revenue climbed 25.5% as reported and 25.2% like-for-like  following on from the growth seen in the first quarter. The scope effect was positive over the period  adding 4.3% to revenue  while the currency effect was an unfavorable 4.0%.Operating revenue: €1 081 millionOperating revenue for the first six months of 2023 came to €1 081 million  up 21.3% as reported. This rise takes into account unfavorable currency effects (-1.4%) and a positive scope effect (+2.7%) mainly linked to the acquisition of Reward Gateway. On a like-for-like basis  operating revenue grew by 20.0% versus first-half 2022.Second-quarter operating revenue totaled €562 million  up 20.9% as reported and up 19.6% like-for-like. The strong sales momentum of previous quarters was confirmed across all business lines. It reflects both growth in revenues generated by existing clients and continued market penetration with new clients of all sizes  largely thanks to the enhanced attractiveness of Edenred’s solutions amid reduced purchasing power  a talent war  and a drive for better control over fleet expenses.Operating revenue by business line(in € millions) First-half 2023 First-half 2022 % change (reported) % change(like-for-like) Benefits & Engagement 662 528 +25.5% +22.8% Mobility 282 252 +12.0% +14.9% Complementary Solutions 137 111 +22.5% +18.0% Total 1 081 891 +21.3% +20.0%The Benefits & Engagement business line  which accounted for 61% of the Group’s business  generated €662 million in operating revenue in first-half 2023  representing like-for-like growth of 22.8% (+25.5% as reported)  including a 22.7% like-for-like rise (+27.3% as reported) in the second quarter.This strong growth was driven by the continued success of Edenred’s digital Ticket Restaurant® offering  popular with both large corporate accounts and SMEs. In addition  with public authorities in many countries raising the statutory maximum face value of benefits since the beginning of 2022  companies are continuing to gradually increase the amounts granted to their employees to help protect their purchasing power. Further increases in maximum face values were decided by public authorities in first-half 2023  including in France  Portugal and the Czech Republic.Performance was also boosted by the continued success of Beyond Food solutions. During the first half of the year  Edenred further expanded its range of employee engagement platforms thanks to the acquisitions of Reward Gateway and GOintegro2. They strengthen Edenred’s position in this market  both geographically (United Kingdom  Australia  United States and Latin America) and in terms of the range of services offered. Edenred’s offering now covers a unified suite of modules ranging from employee discounts and rewards and recognition solutions to well-being and social event solutions.The Group is also leveraging its digital platform to distribute third-party solutions  as illustrated by the partnership entered into in May 2023 with Stairwage  France’s leading salary payment on demand solution.The Mobility business line  which accounts for 26% of the Group’s business  generated €282 million in operating revenue in first-half 2023  representing like-for-like growth of 14.9% (+12.0% as reported)  including a rise of 14.2% in the second quarter on a like-for-like basis (+8.5% as reported).This sustained performance reflects the commercial success of the Beyond Fuel offering for fleet managers in both Europe and Latin America  notably driven by maintenance and toll solutions. These innovative products  such as the fully digital UTA One Next® solution  simplify fleet management and improve profitability  winning over clients of all sizes. However  growth was held back by the decline in fuel prices at the pump to a level significantly lower than in the second quarter of 2022  particularly in Brazil.Complementary Solutions  which includes Corporate Payment Services  Incentive & Rewards and Public Social Programs  generated operating revenue of €137 million in first-half 2023  representing 13% of the Group total. In first-half 2023  this business line was up 18.0% like-for-like (+22.5% as reported)  of which 17.3% like-for-like in the second quarter (+20.0% as reported).This business line’s growth reflects the strong business momentum of Corporate Payment Services in North America  driven by new contract wins in segments such as property management  energy and golf clubs. Edenred Pay USA (formerly Edenred CSI) also received a boost from the integration of IPS (acquired in October 2022)  which has enhanced its offering of payments with invoice automation solutions.Complementary Solutions’ performance also reflects the success of the Group’s innovative programs  such as insurance for involuntary job loss  which already has 270 000 users following its January 2023 launch within the C3Pay super-app in the United Arab Emirates.Operating revenue by region(in € millions) 2023 2022 % change (reported) % change(like-for-like) Europe 677 551 +22.9% +21.2% Latin America 312 270 +15.0% +14.7% Rest of the World 92 70 +33.1% +30.5% Total 1 081 891 +21.3% +20.0%In Europe   operating revenue amounted to €677 million in first-half 2023  an increase of 21.2% like-for-like and of 22.9% as reported. Second-quarter operating revenue rose by 21.9% like-for-like and by 25.7% as reported. Europe represented 63% of Group operating revenue.In France  operating revenue amounted to €169 million in first-half 2023  representing an increase of 12.0% like-for-like and 12.8% as reported. In the second quarter  operating revenue growth was 10.5% like-for-like and 12.0% as reported. This performance reflects sustained growth in Benefits & Engagement solutions  thanks to the commercial success of the Ticket Restaurant® offer with large corporate accounts and SMEs. Beyond Food solutions also posted a robust performance  particularly the ProwebCE employee engagement platform.Mobility solutions contributed to this performance  propelled by ongoing high demand  notably in the SME segment.Operating revenue in Europe excluding France totaled €508 million in first-half 2023  up 24.7% like-for-like and up 26.7% as reported. Second-quarter operating revenue for the region rose by 26.0% like-for-like (+30.5% as reported)  lifted in particular by the contribution of the United Kingdom’s Reward Gateway following first-time consolidation. Benefits& Engagement enjoyed strong momentum across the region  once again turning in a robust performance  boosted by the strong business traction of Ticket Restaurant® and the increase in amounts granted by clients to their employees amid rising maximum face values. Beyond Food solutions continued to enjoy solid growth in the second quarter.The region’s excellent performance also reflects the success of the Beyond Fuel strategy  driven in particular by the launch of the UTA One Next® single European toll box and growing demand for the tax refund services offered by Edenred EBV Finance to European transportation companies.Operating revenue in Latin America amounted to €312 million  up 14.7% like-for-like (+15.0% as reported)  with a 13.6% like-for-like increase and a 9.3% reported increase in the second quarter. The region represented 29% of Group operating revenue.In Brazil  operating revenue increased by 8.1% like-for-like in first-half 2023  reflecting gains of 5.9% in the second quarter. This growth reflects very good business momentum in Benefits & Engagement  spurred by the growing contribution of the Itaú Unibanco partnership in the SME segment. In Mobility  the strong sales performance was mitigated by the sharp drop in fuel prices at the pump compared with the second quarter of 2022  when prices were at their highest for the year. Performance was propelled in particular by the success of the Beyond Fuel strategy  which continues to prove its worth quarter after quarter  thanks to maintenance and toll management solutions.In Hispanic Latin America  operating revenue rose by 30.1% like-for-like in the first half  with a 31.9% increase in the second quarter. This solid performance reflects both Mobility’s continued penetration of the SME segment in Argentina and Mexico  and the strong momentum enjoyed by Benefits & Engagement.In the Rest of the World   operating revenue amounted to €92 million in first-half 2023  up 30.5% like-for-like and up 33.1% as reported. The region represented 8% of Group operating revenue. This strong growth was driven notably by the sustained business momentum of Edenred Pay USA’s corporate payment solutions  as well as by the success of digital solutions offered in countries including the United Arab Emirates and Taiwan.Other revenue: €82 millionOther revenue represented €82 million in first-half 2023  a rise of 166.4% as reported (+185.2% like-for-like). This first-half performance represents another significant increase  reflecting the impact of business growth on the float3 as well as favorable changes in interest rates in all regions where the Group operates. In the eurozone  the series of interest rate hikes that began in July 2022 continued into the first half of 2023  while interest rates in non-eurozone European countries and in Latin America were higher than a year earlier.EBITDA: €483 millionFor the six months ended June 30  2023  EBITDA came in at €483 million  representing growth of 32.5% as reported and 35.2% like-for-like.The EBITDA margin was 3.1 percentage points higher like-for-like  at a record first-half level of 41.5%. This performance demonstrates Edenred’s ability to capitalize on the operating leverage of its platform business model  while maintaining a high level of investment in innovation and technology. EBITDA also benefited from the contribution of other revenue  which was up sharply in the first half.Net profit: €202 millionNet profit  Group share amounted to €202 million versus €170 million in first-half 2022  an 18.8% increase primarily driven by growth in EBITDA.Net profit takes into account other income and expenses for a net expense of €18 million (net expense of €9 million in first-half 2022)  with the increase owing mainly to the costs of acquiring Reward Gateway. It also includes a net financial expense of €58 million (net financial expense of €17 million in first-half 2022)  representing an additional €41 million as a result of the rise in interest rates impacting the cost of debt  the financial expense linked to the debt raised to fund the acquisition of Reward Gateway  and the negative impact of hyperinflation in Argentina and Turkey. Lastly  net profit takes into account an income tax expense of €102 million (income tax expense of €84 million in first-half 2022)  and non-controlling interests for a negative €17 million (negative €16 million in first-half 2022).Strong cash flow generationEdenred leveraged its strongly cash-generative business model to deliver record-high funds from operations before other income and expenses (FFO) of €338 million in first-half 2023  up 12 9% as reported.At June 30  2023  Edenred had net debt of €1 851 million  versus €1 056 million at end-June 2022. The increase in net debt comes as a result of the £1.15 billion4 acquisition – the Group’s largest ever – of Reward Gateway in May 2023  financed by a €1.2 billion two-tranche bond issue in June 2023  and by €0.1 billion in available cash. It also reflects free cash flow generation of €868 million over the twelve months ended June 30  2023  €281 million returned to shareholders  and a negative €3 million impact of currency effects and non-recurring items.A solid financial positionEdenred enjoys a solid financial position with a high level of liquidity. In April 2023  Standard & Poor’s raised the Group’s rating to A- Strong Investment Grade with a stable outlook. This rating was confirmed following the acquisition of Reward Gateway  announced in May 2023.Commitment to ESG and extra-financial performanceIn the first half of 2023  Edenred further strengthened its commitment to social and environmental responsibility by becoming an official supporter of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)  joining 4 000 companies and organizations worldwide that have expressed their support for the TCFD’s recommendations.The Group’s ESG policy has also been recognized by other external bodies. For example  Edenred is now included in Axylia’s Vérité40 index  obtaining an A carbon score. This rating reflects Edenred’s commitment to protecting the environment by reducing its carbon impact  with the aim of achieving net zero carbon by 2050 in line with SBTi targets5  as well as supporting its clients in promoting a healthy  balanced diet and in their transition to sustainable mobility.OUTLOOKIn line with the good performance recorded in the first half of the year  Edenred will continue to roll out its Beyond 22-25 strategy  fully leveraging its B2B2C digital platform model.In particular  Edenred will capitalize on its strong business momentum to further develop its offering in still largely underpenetrated markets  notably in the SME segment. As the operating environment continues to be shaped by a talent war  reduced purchasing power and greater consideration among fleet managers of the risks and opportunities of the energy transition  the attractiveness of Edenred solutions will keep serving as a powerful growth driver.In line with its objectives  Edenred will also work to further extend its offering beyond food  beyond fuel and beyond payment  as illustrated perfectly by the integration and international expansion of newly acquired employee engagement platforms Reward Gateway and GOintegro.

This indicator reflects the Group’s business performance.Changes in activity (like-for-like or organic growth) represent changes in amounts between the current period and the comparative period  adjusted for currency effects and for the impact of acquisitions and/or disposals.The impact of acquisitions is eliminated from the amount reported for the current period. The impact of disposals is eliminated from the amount reported for the comparative period. The sum of these two amounts is known as the impact of changes in the scope of consolidation or the scope effect.The calculation of changes in activity is translated at the exchange rate applicable in the comparative period and divided by the adjusted amount for the comparative period.The currency effect is the difference between the amount for the reported period translated at the exchange rate for the reported period and the amount for the reported period translated at the exchange rate applicable in the comparative period.Business volume:Business volume comprises total issue volume of Benefits & Engagement solutions  Incentive and Rewards  Public Social Program solutions and Corporate Payment Services  plus the transaction volume of Fleet & Mobility Solutions and other solutions.Issue volume:Issue volume is the total face value of the funds preloaded on all of the payment solutions issued by Edenred to its corporate and public sector clients.Transaction volume:Transaction volume represents the total value of the transactions paid for with payment instruments  at the time of the transaction.b) Alternative performance measurement indicators included in the June 30  2023 Interim Financial ReportThe alternative performance measurement indicators outlined below are presented and reconciled with accounting data in the Annual Financial Report.Indicator Reference note in Edenred’s 2023 condensed interim consolidated financial statements Operating revenueOperating revenue corresponds to: operating revenue generated by prepaid vouchers managed by Edenred and operating revenue from value-added services such as incentive programs  human services and event-related services.It corresponds to the amount billed to the client company and is recognized on delivery of the solutions.

Thanks to the hard work and talent of our 12 000 employees  this growth is proving ever more profitable  while we continue investing in our technology assets. We are pressing ahead with our Beyond 22-25 strategic plan to further penetrate our markets  enhance the experience of our clients  partner merchants and users  and enrich our offering of increasingly relevant solutions.During the first half  we notably strengthened our position as the most trusted global Employee Benefits platform by acquiring Reward Gateway  which operates in the UK  Australia and the US  and GOintegro in Latin America. The acquisition of these two leading employee engagement platforms will enable us to provide HR departments with an even more comprehensive range of solutions  making their organizations more attractive so they can attract and retain top talent. We also plan to expand Reward Gateway’s coverage to a selection of key countries in Continental Europe.Lastly  thanks to the agility of our platform  we are starting to distribute third-party services  such as salary advance solutions  to better meet the expectations of a fast-changing world of work.After this strong first half  our outlook for the second half of the year is just as promising  as we target EBITDA of between€1 020 million and €1 090 million for full-year 2023.”FIRST-HALF 2023 RESULTSAt its meeting on July 24  2023  the Board of Directors reviewed the Group’s interim consolidated financial statements for the six months ended June 30  2023.Key financial metrics:(in € millions) First-half 2023 First-half 2022 % change (reported) % change(like-for-like) Operating revenue 1 081 891 +21.3% +20.0% Other revenue 82 31 +166.4% +185.2% Total revenue 1 163 922 +26.1% +25.5% EBITDA 483 365 +32.5% +35.2% EBIT 399 295 +35.2% +40.3% Net profit  Group share 202 170 +18.8%Total revenue: €1 163 millionTotal revenue for first-half 2023 amounted to €1 163 million  up 26.1% as reported compared with first-half 2022. This increase includes unfavorable currency effects (-2.0%) and a positive scope effect (+2.7%) mainly linked to the acquisition of Reward Gateway  consolidated since May 2023. On a like-for-like basis  total revenue was up 25.5%.In the second quarter  total revenue climbed 25.5% as reported and 25.2% like-for-like  following on from the growth seen in the first quarter. The scope effect was positive over the period  adding 4.3% to revenue  while the currency effect was an unfavorable 4.0%.Operating revenue: €1 081 millionOperating revenue for the first six months of 2023 came to €1 081 million  up 21.3% as reported. This rise takes into account unfavorable currency effects (-1.4%) and a positive scope effect (+2.7%) mainly linked to the acquisition of Reward Gateway. On a like-for-like basis  operating revenue grew by 20.0% versus first-half 2022.Second-quarter operating revenue totaled €562 million  up 20.9% as reported and up 19.6% like-for-like. The strong sales momentum of previous quarters was confirmed across all business lines. It reflects both growth in revenues generated by existing clients and continued market penetration with new clients of all sizes  largely thanks to the enhanced attractiveness of Edenred’s solutions amid reduced purchasing power  a talent war  and a drive for better control over fleet expenses.Operating revenue by business line(in € millions) First-half 2023 First-half 2022 % change (reported) % change(like-for-like) Benefits & Engagement 662 528 +25.5% +22.8% Mobility 282 252 +12.0% +14.9% Complementary Solutions 137 111 +22.5% +18.0% Total 1 081 891 +21.3% +20.0%The Benefits & Engagement business line  which accounted for 61% of the Group’s business  generated €662 million in operating revenue in first-half 2023  representing like-for-like growth of 22.8% (+25.5% as reported)  including a 22.7% like-for-like rise (+27.3% as reported) in the second quarter.This strong growth was driven by the continued success of Edenred’s digital Ticket Restaurant® offering  popular with both large corporate accounts and SMEs. In addition  with public authorities in many countries raising the statutory maximum face value of benefits since the beginning of 2022  companies are continuing to gradually increase the amounts granted to their employees to help protect their purchasing power. Further increases in maximum face values were decided by public authorities in first-half 2023  including in France  Portugal and the Czech Republic.Performance was also boosted by the continued success of Beyond Food solutions. During the first half of the year  Edenred further expanded its range of employee engagement platforms thanks to the acquisitions of Reward Gateway and GOintegro2. They strengthen Edenred’s position in this market  both geographically (United Kingdom  Australia  United States and Latin America) and in terms of the range of services offered. Edenred’s offering now covers a unified suite of modules ranging from employee discounts and rewards and recognition solutions to well-being and social event solutions.The Group is also leveraging its digital platform to distribute third-party solutions  as illustrated by the partnership entered into in May 2023 with Stairwage  France’s leading salary payment on demand solution.The Mobility business line  which accounts for 26% of the Group’s business  generated €282 million in operating revenue in first-half 2023  representing like-for-like growth of 14.9% (+12.0% as reported)  including a rise of 14.2% in the second quarter on a like-for-like basis (+8.5% as reported).This sustained performance reflects the commercial success of the Beyond Fuel offering for fleet managers in both Europe and Latin America  notably driven by maintenance and toll solutions. These innovative products  such as the fully digital UTA One Next® solution  simplify fleet management and improve profitability  winning over clients of all sizes. However  growth was held back by the decline in fuel prices at the pump to a level significantly lower than in the second quarter of 2022  particularly in Brazil.Complementary Solutions  which includes Corporate Payment Services  Incentive & Rewards and Public Social Programs  generated operating revenue of €137 million in first-half 2023  representing 13% of the Group total. In first-half 2023  this business line was up 18.0% like-for-like (+22.5% as reported)  of which 17.3% like-for-like in the second quarter (+20.0% as reported).This business line’s growth reflects the strong business momentum of Corporate Payment Services in North America  driven by new contract wins in segments such as property management  energy and golf clubs. Edenred Pay USA (formerly Edenred CSI) also received a boost from the integration of IPS (acquired in October 2022)  which has enhanced its offering of payments with invoice automation solutions.Complementary Solutions’ performance also reflects the success of the Group’s innovative programs  such as insurance for involuntary job loss  which already has 270 000 users following its January 2023 launch within the C3Pay super-app in the United Arab Emirates.Operating revenue by region(in € millions) 2023 2022 % change (reported) % change(like-for-like) Europe 677 551 +22.9% +21.2% Latin America 312 270 +15.0% +14.7% Rest of the World 92 70 +33.1% +30.5% Total 1 081 891 +21.3% +20.0%In Europe   operating revenue amounted to €677 million in first-half 2023  an increase of 21.2% like-for-like and of 22.9% as reported. Second-quarter operating revenue rose by 21.9% like-for-like and by 25.7% as reported. Europe represented 63% of Group operating revenue.In France  operating revenue amounted to €169 million in first-half 2023  representing an increase of 12.0% like-for-like and 12.8% as reported. In the second quarter  operating revenue growth was 10.5% like-for-like and 12.0% as reported. This performance reflects sustained growth in Benefits & Engagement solutions  thanks to the commercial success of the Ticket Restaurant® offer with large corporate accounts and SMEs. Beyond Food solutions also posted a robust performance  particularly the ProwebCE employee engagement platform.Mobility solutions contributed to this performance  propelled by ongoing high demand  notably in the SME segment.Operating revenue in Europe excluding France totaled €508 million in first-half 2023  up 24.7% like-for-like and up 26.7% as reported. Second-quarter operating revenue for the region rose by 26.0% like-for-like (+30.5% as reported)  lifted in particular by the contribution of the United Kingdom’s Reward Gateway following first-time consolidation. Benefits& Engagement enjoyed strong momentum across the region  once again turning in a robust performance  boosted by the strong business traction of Ticket Restaurant® and the increase in amounts granted by clients to their employees amid rising maximum face values. Beyond Food solutions continued to enjoy solid growth in the second quarter.The region’s excellent performance also reflects the success of the Beyond Fuel strategy  driven in particular by the launch of the UTA One Next® single European toll box and growing demand for the tax refund services offered by Edenred EBV Finance to European transportation companies.Operating revenue in Latin America amounted to €312 million  up 14.7% like-for-like (+15.0% as reported)  with a 13.6% like-for-like increase and a 9.3% reported increase in the second quarter. The region represented 29% of Group operating revenue.In Brazil  operating revenue increased by 8.1% like-for-like in first-half 2023  reflecting gains of 5.9% in the second quarter. This growth reflects very good business momentum in Benefits & Engagement  spurred by the growing contribution of the Itaú Unibanco partnership in the SME segment. In Mobility  the strong sales performance was mitigated by the sharp drop in fuel prices at the pump compared with the second quarter of 2022  when prices were at their highest for the year. Performance was propelled in particular by the success of the Beyond Fuel strategy  which continues to prove its worth quarter after quarter  thanks to maintenance and toll management solutions.In Hispanic Latin America  operating revenue rose by 30.1% like-for-like in the first half  with a 31.9% increase in the second quarter. This solid performance reflects both Mobility’s continued penetration of the SME segment in Argentina and Mexico  and the strong momentum enjoyed by Benefits & Engagement.In the Rest of the World   operating revenue amounted to €92 million in first-half 2023  up 30.5% like-for-like and up 33.1% as reported. The region represented 8% of Group operating revenue. This strong growth was driven notably by the sustained business momentum of Edenred Pay USA’s corporate payment solutions  as well as by the success of digital solutions offered in countries including the United Arab Emirates and Taiwan.Other revenue: €82 millionOther revenue represented €82 million in first-half 2023  a rise of 166.4% as reported (+185.2% like-for-like). This first-half performance represents another significant increase  reflecting the impact of business growth on the float3 as well as favorable changes in interest rates in all regions where the Group operates. In the eurozone  the series of interest rate hikes that began in July 2022 continued into the first half of 2023  while interest rates in non-eurozone European countries and in Latin America were higher than a year earlier.EBITDA: €483 millionFor the six months ended June 30  2023  EBITDA came in at €483 million  representing growth of 32.5% as reported and 35.2% like-for-like.The EBITDA margin was 3.1 percentage points higher like-for-like  at a record first-half level of 41.5%. This performance demonstrates Edenred’s ability to capitalize on the operating leverage of its platform business model  while maintaining a high level of investment in innovation and technology. EBITDA also benefited from the contribution of other revenue  which was up sharply in the first half.Net profit: €202 millionNet profit  Group share amounted to €202 million versus €170 million in first-half 2022  an 18.8% increase primarily driven by growth in EBITDA.Net profit takes into account other income and expenses for a net expense of €18 million (net expense of €9 million in first-half 2022)  with the increase owing mainly to the costs of acquiring Reward Gateway. It also includes a net financial expense of €58 million (net financial expense of €17 million in first-half 2022)  representing an additional €41 million as a result of the rise in interest rates impacting the cost of debt  the financial expense linked to the debt raised to fund the acquisition of Reward Gateway  and the negative impact of hyperinflation in Argentina and Turkey. Lastly  net profit takes into account an income tax expense of €102 million (income tax expense of €84 million in first-half 2022)  and non-controlling interests for a negative €17 million (negative €16 million in first-half 2022).Strong cash flow generationEdenred leveraged its strongly cash-generative business model to deliver record-high funds from operations before other income and expenses (FFO) of €338 million in first-half 2023  up 12 9% as reported.At June 30  2023  Edenred had net debt of €1 851 million  versus €1 056 million at end-June 2022. The increase in net debt comes as a result of the £1.15 billion4 acquisition – the Group’s largest ever – of Reward Gateway in May 2023  financed by a €1.2 billion two-tranche bond issue in June 2023  and by €0.1 billion in available cash. It also reflects free cash flow generation of €868 million over the twelve months ended June 30  2023  €281 million returned to shareholders  and a negative €3 million impact of currency effects and non-recurring items.A solid financial positionEdenred enjoys a solid financial position with a high level of liquidity. In April 2023  Standard & Poor’s raised the Group’s rating to A- Strong Investment Grade with a stable outlook. This rating was confirmed following the acquisition of Reward Gateway  announced in May 2023.Commitment to ESG and extra-financial performanceIn the first half of 2023  Edenred further strengthened its commitment to social and environmental responsibility by becoming an official supporter of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)  joining 4 000 companies and organizations worldwide that have expressed their support for the TCFD’s recommendations.The Group’s ESG policy has also been recognized by other external bodies. For example  Edenred is now included in Axylia’s Vérité40 index  obtaining an A carbon score. This rating reflects Edenred’s commitment to protecting the environment by reducing its carbon impact  with the aim of achieving net zero carbon by 2050 in line with SBTi targets5  as well as supporting its clients in promoting a healthy  balanced diet and in their transition to sustainable mobility.OUTLOOKIn line with the good performance recorded in the first half of the year  Edenred will continue to roll out its Beyond 22-25 strategy  fully leveraging its B2B2C digital platform model.In particular  Edenred will capitalize on its strong business momentum to further develop its offering in still largely underpenetrated markets  notably in the SME segment. As the operating environment continues to be shaped by a talent war  reduced purchasing power and greater consideration among fleet managers of the risks and opportunities of the energy transition  the attractiveness of Edenred solutions will keep serving as a powerful growth driver.In line with its objectives  Edenred will also work to further extend its offering beyond food  beyond fuel and beyond payment  as illustrated perfectly by the integration and international expansion of newly acquired employee engagement platforms Reward Gateway and GOintegro. In addition  by harnessing the flexibility of its platform model  the Group will seek to form new partnerships to broaden its offering  aggregating third-party products on its platform as well as having its own solutions distributed via indirect channels.Lastly  by continuing to invest in its first-in-class technology assets  Edenred intends to further enhance the user experience  notably by developing data-powered solutions and services.By seizing all these opportunities  the Group will continue to generate sustainable and profitable growth. The Group expects to generate full-year EBITDA of between €1 020 million and €1 090 million in 2023  versus €836 million in 2022.SIGNIFICANT EVENTS IN THE SECOND QUARTEREdenred accelerates the extension of its Benefits & Engagement solutions in the Employee Engagement arena by acquiring leading platform Reward GatewayEdenred announced the acquisition of 100% of the share capital of Reward Gateway  a leading Employee Engagement platform with strong positions in the UK and in Australia  and also present in the United States.

The issue will be used to finance a significant part of the £1.15 billion acquisition of Reward Gateway which was fully paid in cash by Edenred.Placed with a diverse base of international institutional investors  the bond issue was approximately three times oversubscribed. The great success of this issue highlights the market’s confidence in Edenred credit quality.Edenred joins the CAC 40Edenred’s inclusion in the CAC 40 index is recognition of the Group’s stock market performance since its IPO on July 2  2010.

This indicator reflects the Group’s business performance.Changes in activity (like-for-like or organic growth) represent changes in amounts between the current period and the comparative period  adjusted for currency effects and for the impact of acquisitions and/or disposals.The impact of acquisitions is eliminated from the amount reported for the current period. The impact of disposals is eliminated from the amount reported for the comparative period. The sum of these two amounts is known as the impact of changes in the scope of consolidation or the scope effect.The calculation of changes in activity is translated at the exchange rate applicable in the comparative period and divided by the adjusted amount for the comparative period.The currency effect is the difference between the amount for the reported period translated at the exchange rate for the reported period and the amount for the reported period translated at the exchange rate applicable in the comparative period.Business volume:Business volume comprises total issue volume of Benefits & Engagement solutions  Incentive and Rewards  Public Social Program solutions and Corporate Payment Services  plus the transaction volume of Fleet & Mobility Solutions and other solutions.Issue volume:Issue volume is the total face value of the funds preloaded on all of the payment solutions issued by Edenred to its corporate and public sector clients.Transaction volume:Transaction volume represents the total value of the transactions paid for with payment instruments  at the time of the transaction.b) Alternative performance measurement indicators included in the June 30  2023 Interim Financial ReportThe alternative performance measurement indicators outlined below are presented and reconciled with accounting data in the Annual Financial Report.Indicator Reference note in Edenred’s 2023 condensed interim consolidated financial statements Operating revenueOperating revenue corresponds to: operating revenue generated by prepaid vouchers managed by Edenred and operating revenue from value-added services such as incentive programs  human services and event-related services.It corresponds to the amount billed to the client company and is recognized on delivery of the solutions. Other revenueOther revenue is interest generated by investing cash over the period between:the issue date and the reimbursement date for vouchers and the loading date and the redeeming date for cards.

The invested amount for Trilantic Capital Partners includes an initial payment of $ 10 million.PERFORMANCENET ASSET VALUEThe NAV comprises total assets less total liabilities  and equates to total equity under International Financial Reporting Standards. The decrease in the NAV of € 74 million during the quarter reflects decreases in the estimated fair value of certain investments  including British American Tobacco p.l.c. (‘BAT’)  TruArc Partners and Prescient China funds  partially offset by dividends received from Pension Insurance Corporation Group Limited. Details of the Company’s NAV and details of movements in key investments can be found on pages 2 and 3 of this report. Reinet records its assets and liabilities in euro; the strengthening of sterling against the euro  offset by the weakening of the US dollar against the euro has resulted in an overall increase in the value of certain assets and liabilities in euro terms. Applying current quarter-end exchange rates to the March 2023 assets and liabilities would have resulted in an increase in the March 2023 NAV of some € 92 million. SHARE BUYBACK PROGRAMME The Company repurchased 14 151 395 ordinary shares between November 2018 and May 2022 under five share buyback programmes. The cost of the ordinary shares repurchased under these five share buyback programmes amounted to € 222 million  plus transaction costs. As at 30 June 2023  there was no share buyback programme in progress. All ordinary shares repurchased are held as treasury shares. NET ASSET VALUE PER SHARE The NAV per share of the Company is calculated by dividing the NAV by the number of shares outstanding (excluding treasury shares) of 181 790 891 (31 March 2023: 181 790 891). 30 June 2023 31 March 2023 Shares in issue 195 942 286 195 942 286 Treasury shares (14 151 395) (14 151 395) Net shares 181 790 891 181 790 891 € m € m NAV (see page 2) 5 646 5 720 € per share € per share NAV per share 31.06 31.46 SHARE PRICE The Company’s indicative share price as quoted on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange increased by 6 per cent in the quarter from € 18.80 at 31 March 2023 to € 20.00 at 30 June 2023.

Share prices as at 30 June 2023 and 31 March 2023 were as follows: 30 June 2023 31 March 2023 ZAR EUR ZAR EUR Luxembourg - 20.00 - 18.80 Amsterdam - 20.60 - 19.00 Johannesburg 416.95 - 365.06 - GLOBAL MARKETS BACKDROP Global markets continue to be impacted by the effects of the ongoing Ukraine crisis  increasing interest rates and rising inflation. Rising inflation continues to put significant pressure on households and consumers as many central banks continue to increase interest rates to mitigate the inflation concerns. The extent and impact of these factors remain uncertain. Reinet has no direct exposure to Russia or Ukraine through its underlying investments or banking relationships and has not experienced any significant direct impacts in respect of interest rate increases or rising inflation. Reinet has various banking relationships with highly rated institutions  and a well-diversified approach to cash and liquidity management. Reinet continues to value its investments in line with the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation (‘IPEV’) guidelines and its approved valuation procedures and methodologies. All investment valuations have been prepared using latest available data  including exchange rates and listed share prices as at 30 June 2023. Discussions have taken place with fund managers and investee companies to determine any significant changes in value and any impacts related to the Ukraine crisis  volatility in stock and currency markets  interest rates  inflation and exposure to certain financial institutions. Future valuations will take into account any new impacts of the above  which could affect the valuation of underlying investments. INVESTMENTS Reinet seeks  through a range of investment structures  to build partnerships with other investors  specialised fund managers and entrepreneurs to find and develop opportunities for long-term value creation for its shareholders. Since its formation in 2008  Reinet has invested some € 3.6 billion and at 30 June 2023 committed to provide further funding of € 618 million to its current investments. New commitments during the quarter under review amounted to € 38 million  and a total of € 43 million was funded during the quarter. LISTED INVESTMENTS BRITISH AMERICAN TOBACCO P.L.C. The investment in BAT remains one of Reinet’s largest investments and is kept under constant review  considering the company’s performance  the industry outlook  cash flows from dividends  stock market performance  volatility and liquidity. Reinet holds 48.3 million BAT shares representing some 2.16 per cent of BAT’s issued share capital as at 30 June 2023. The value of Reinet’s investment in BAT amounted to € 1 466 million at 30 June 2023 (31 March 2023: € 1 561 million)  being some 26.0 per cent of Reinet’s NAV. The decrease in value reflects the decrease in the BAT share price on the London Stock Exchange from £ 28.41 at 31 March 2023 to £ 26.08 at 30 June 2023 offset by the strengthening of sterling against the euro during the quarter. Further information on BAT is available at www.bat.com/annualreport OTHER LISTED INVESTMENTS Other listed investments comprised: 30 June 2023 31 March 2023 € m € m Grab Holdings Limited 33 29 Selecta Biosciences  Inc. 2 2 Soho China Limited 6 7 SPDR Gold shares 38 39 Twist Bioscience Corporation 8 6 87 83 The increase in value reflects increases in the listed share prices of Grab Holdings Limited and Twist Bioscience Corporation between 31 March 2023 and 30 June 2023  offset by the weakening of the US dollar against the euro during the quarter. UNLISTED INVESTMENTS Unlisted investments are carried at their estimated fair value. In determining fair value  Reinet Fund Manager S.A. (the ‘Fund Manager’) relies on audited and unaudited financial statements of investee companies  management reports and valuations provided by third-party experts. Valuation methodologies applied include the NAV of investment funds  discounted cash flow models and comparable valuation multiples  as appropriate. PENSION INSURANCE CORPORATION GROUP LIMITED On 27 February 2023  Pension Insurance Corporation Group Limited (‘Pension Corporation’) announced that Pension Insurance Corporation (‘PIC’) had concluded a buy-in with the Trustees of two schemes sponsored by RSA Group covering the pensions of 40 000 members. RSA Group is a wholly owned subsidiary of Intact Financial Corporation. This is the largest ever UK bulk annuity transaction and paves the way for other large transactions as part of the anticipated increase in volumes of new business coming to market. In April 2023  the shareholders of Pension Corporation approved an inaugural dividend of 7.50 pence per ordinary share. Reinet’s share of the dividend amounting to some € 57 million (£ 50 million) was received on 10 May 2023. On 19 June 2023  Pension Corporation published an update for the quarter ended 31 March 2023 which included new business premiums of £ 6.2 billion following the record buy-in of two schemes sponsored by RSA Group; an estimated solvency ratio of 193% (31 December 2022: 225%) assuming full implementation of the RSA Group transaction and confirming the payment of the inaugural dividend; and portfolio assets of £ 47 billion (31 December 2022: £ 41 billion). Reinet’s investment in Pension Corporation is carried at an estimated fair value of € 2 792 million at 30 June 2023 (31 March 2023: € 2 787 million). This value is based on Pension Corporation’s audited adjusted equity own funds value at 31 December 2022 of £ 5.9 billion (no adjustment has been made for the dividend paid of £ 100 million considering the value added by the new business written in the period)  corresponding valuation multiples drawn from industry data for a selected UK insurance peer group as at 30 June 2023 and a discount of 10 per cent which takes into account the illiquid nature of Reinet’s investment. The increase in Reinet’s estimated fair value of Pension Corporation over the quarter is mainly due to the strengthening of sterling against the euro in the quarter offset by a decrease in comparable company multiples derived from public information of listed peer-group companies in the UK insurance sector between 31 March 2023 and 30 June 2023. The investment in Pension Corporation represents some 49.5 per cent of Reinet’s NAV at 30 June 2023  compared to 48.7 per cent at 31 March 2023.

The women's team meanwhile achieved a League-Cup Double for the season and reached the Champions League quarterfinals (against Chelsea).As part of the review of clubs' positions going into the 2023/2024 season  the Professional Club Monitoring Panel of the DNCG took the decision to monitor Olympique Lyonnais' total wage bill and transfer spending. In response to an appeal from OL  the DNCG's decision was confirmed  despite the club's representations. The club notes that this cap remains in force but continues to explore possible avenues of recourse.After the first two payments (for a total of €40 million) under the LFP/CVC deal[2]  the Group is set to receive the third and final tranche (€50 million) in 2023/2024  provided the planned transactions between the LFP and CVC Capital Partners are completed.The Groupama Stadium once again has a rich program of events especially for the 2023/2024 season: the Red Hot Chili Peppers (11 July 2023) and Taylor Swift (2 and 3 June 2024)  Coldplay (22  23 and 25 June 2024)  together with sports events: 5 matches in the Rugby World Cup (September/October 2023)  the Rugby Six Nations match between France and England (16 March 2024)  a match involving the French national men's football team (March 2024)  11 men's and women's football matches as part of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games (July-August 2024)  the opening and closing ceremonies of the WorldSkills Lyon 2024 at the Groupama Stadium and the LDLC Arena (September 2024)  as well as the semi-finals of the rugby TOP 14 (June 2025).Construction of the LDLC Arena  100% assumed by OL Groupe  which began in January 2022  is now reaching completion. The operational opening of the venue is planned for late November 2023  with a strong line-up already booked including Florence Foresti  Lomepal  Sting  Calogero  Shaka Ponk  Michel Sardou  Hoshi  Grand Corps Malade  Slimane  Patrick Bruel  Alors On Danse  ERA  Molière Opéra Urbain  Starmania andGims. It will also host 13 Basketball Euroleague matches for LDLC Asvel.OL Groupe also reiterates its medium-term objectives  which are to achieve the following by 2025/26: (i) total revenue in the region of €400-420 million (scenario includes a Champions League qualification and player trading) and (ii) EBITDA in excess of €90 million.Regarding financial debt  OL Groupe is working actively with a number of leading French and international financial institutions on various refinancing programs for its “Stadium” debts  the government guaranteed loan (PGE – Prêt Garanti par l'État) and the revolving credit facility (RCF). It should be noted that outstanding “Stadium” debts and the RCF mature on 30 June 2024  whilst repayments on the PGE loan began at the beginning of 2023. The group will provide an update on its refinancing projects in due course.OL GROUPETel: +33 (0)4 81 07 55 00Fax: +33 (0)4 81 07 45 65Email: investisseurs@ol.frwww.ol.frEuronext Paris - Segment CIndices: CAC Small – CAC Mid & Small – CAC All-Tradable – CAC All-Share – CAC Consumer DiscretionaryISIN code: FR0010428771Reuters: OLG.PABloomberg: OLG FPICB: 40501030 Recreational services[1] Alternative Performance Indicator (API): “Total revenue” corresponds to the previous definition of “Total revenue”  i.e. revenue excluding player trading plus proceeds from the sale of player registrations.[2]Reminder: Following the creation by LFP of a commercial subsidiary  in which CVC Capital Partners acquired a stake in July 2022 (13% for €1.5 billion)  the governing body of Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 and the Board of Directors of the LFP approved the breakdown of the €1.13 billion to be paid to the clubs (spread over several financial years)  including a total of €90 million to be paid to Olympique Lyonnais.This publication embed ""🔒 Actusnews SECURITY MASTER "".- SECURITY MASTER Key: xpyfaJtolWnHlp5qZMpul2Zra2+VmZaYaGWZlWqeaZuda2+UmmljnMnHZnFilmtq- Check this key: https://www.security-master-key.com .Regulated information:Inside Information:- Information on annual revenues Full and original press release in PDF: https://www.actusnews.com/news/81164-olg-250723-ca-t4-22-23-en.pdfReceive by email the next press releases of the company by registering on www.actusnews.com   it's free© 2023 ActusNews",neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,mixed,0.46,0.27,0.27,True,English,"['Olympique Lyonnais Groupe', 'FINANCIAL YEAR', 'REVENUE', 'two largest Ligue 1 draws', 'Washington Spirit NWSL club', 'The OL Féminin', 'Washington Spirit teams', 'first two tranches', 'Mylène Farmer', 'Léo Dubois', 'Cenk Ozkaçar', 'Matheus Tête', 'Mr. John Textor', 'Mr. Jean-Michel Aulas', 'multi-team global women', 'Chief Executive Officer', 'Interim Executive President', 'Seminars/stadium tours activities', 'strong consumer demand', 'previous financial year', 'EXCL.

Excluding the impact of these contracts  organic growth is close to 4%  and rebounded to 6% between the 1st and 2nd quarters on the back of good momentum in Continental  Western and Eastern Europe.Revenue in the Americas fell organically by nearly 3%. This reflects contrasting realities  with very good momentum in Latin America (organic growth above 8%) and a decline in sales of around 4% in North America  penalized compared to an excellent first half 2022 (16% organic growth in the region) by (i) the drop in demand from major Tech customers and (ii) contract delays in our Public Affairs business in the United States  linked in part to the debate in the second quarter on the US government spending cap.Finally  the Asia-Pacific region posted organic growth of 3%  with a clear upturn in the 2nd quarter (7% compared with -2% in the first quarter)  driven by very good momentum in India and Southeast Asia. As expected  business activity in China picked up in the second quarter (6.5%) following the end of the zero-Covid policy at the start of the year  but the rebound of the Chinese economy after the pandemic remains lower than that seen in the West after the lockdowns.PERFORMANCE BY AUDIENCEIn millions of Euros H1 2023 Contribution Organic growthH1 2023/H1 2022 Reminder: Organic growthH1 2022 vs H1 2021 Consumers1 513.2 47% 3% 14% Clients and employees2 240.1 22% 0.5% 9% Citizens3 163.9 15% -12.5% -12% Doctors and patients4 169.9 16% -3% 8% Revenue 1 087.1 100% -1.1% 6.9%Breakdown of Service Lines by audience segment:1- Brand Health Tracking  Creative Excellence  Innovation  Ipsos UU  Ipsos MMA  Market Strategy & Understanding  Observer (excl. public sector)  Social Intelligence Analytics  Strategy32- Automotive & Mobility Development  Audience Measurement  Customer Experience  Channel Performance (Mystery Shopping and Shopper)  Media development  ERM  Capabilities3- Public Affairs  Corporate Reputation4- Pharma (quantitative and qualitative)Our Consumer business rebounded in the 2nd quarter (+5%) and posted organic growth of 3% in the first half  on top of 14% last year. The excellent performance of our brand health monitoring  marketing spend optimization and market positioning activities reflects our clients’ need to continue to understand consumer behavior in a complex  ever-changing world that is increasingly difficult to decipher.Our business with Clients and employees is stable overall  following strong growth last year. Our service lines dedicated to customer experience and channel performance evaluation are showing very good momentum  as economies re-open fully and travel returns but this audience segment is penalized by the decline in demand from Big Tech clients.Work among Citizens fell by over 12%  reflecting the end of Covid contracts. Underlying revenue excluding Covid public sector contracts grew organically by 3.5%. The need for governments and institutions to understand the dynamics of public opinion and the expectations of citizens is important in a context marked by multiple crises: geopolitical  democratic  economic and ecological.Lastly  our business with doctors and patients stabilized in the second quarter and posted an organic decline of 3% for the first half as a whole. Business suffered from delays in decision-making by certain pharmaceutical industry customers  who have suffered extended delays in the approval of new drugs  and a wide range of restructuring post pandemic. That said  sales momentum is good  and the order book for our healthcare business line has grown organically close to 9% since January. We are also pleased to announce the appointment of Bonnie Bain as the new head of this service line  whose experience will enable us to accelerate our development with customers in the healthcare sector.Overall growth in the 1st half should be assessed in the light of a number of factors:Firstly  the excellent performance achieved in the 1 st half of 2022  which led to unfavorable base effects. As a result  revenue for the 1 st half of 2023 is almost €100 million higher than for the first half of 2021  representing organic growth of 6% over 2 years.half of 2022  which led to unfavorable base effects. As a result  revenue for the 1 half of 2023 is almost €100 million higher than for the first half of 2021  representing organic growth of 6% over 2 years. Secondly  the impact of the end of the major Covid pandemic monitoring contracts  mainly in the first quarter. Excluding the impact of these contracts  underlying business for the first half rose organically by 1.1%.Lastly  the decline in business from major Tech customers undergoing restructuring (down 18% in the first half compared with the same period last year). These customers experienced exceptional growth during the pandemic  before entering a period of uncertainty from last summer onwards. To date  the situation of these customers is varied: while demand for studies has rebounded in some cases  it remains low in others. We have a number of major contracts under discussion  both for traditional activities (product testing  brand health research  mystery shopping  etc.) and for numerous opportunities linked to generative artificial intelligence. We therefore expect a recovery in the coming months  but the timing remains uncertain.FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE FOR THE FIRST HALFSummary income statementIn millions of Euros June 30  2023 June 30  2022 Change ReminderDec. 31 2022 Revenue 1 087.1 1 121.7 -3.1% 2 405.3 Gross margin 736.1 739.7 -0.5% 1 594.1 Gross margin / revenue 67.7% 65.9% 66.3% Operating margin 94.3 126.8 -25.6% 314.7 Operating margin / revenue 8.7% 11.3% 13.1% Other non-recurring / recurring income and expenses (0.9) 0.9 3.7 Finance costs (6.6) (6.2) (13.2) Tax (20.9) (29.5) (72.8) Net profit attributable to the owner of the parent 56.4 85.5 215.2 Adjusted net profit* attributable to the owner of the parent 70.1 97.5 -28.1% 232.3*Adjusted net income is calculated before (i) non-cash items related to IFRS 2 (share-based payment)  (ii) amortization of acquisition-related intangibles (customer relations)  (iii) the impact net of tax of other non-recurring income and expenses  (iv) non-cash impacts on changes in puts in other financial income and expenses and (v) before deferred tax liabilities related to goodwill for which amortization is deductible in certain countries.The gross margin (which is calculated by deducting external and variable costs associated with contract performance from revenue) is up 180 basis points to 67.7% compared to 65.9% for last year at this point. This increase in the gross margin ratio reflects change in the mix of data collection methods  and can be explained by (i) the end of major pandemic monitoring contracts (whose collection costs were higher than the average) (ii) the increase in the proportion of online surveys (even though the post-pandemic upturn in business has resulted in a resumption of offline surveys in less digitalized countries such as India) (iii)  a mix effect linked to the strong growth of our activity in marketing spend optimization and advisory work which does not require data collection and whose gross margin is significantly higher than that of the rest of the Group. Lastly  the increase in gross margin in the first half also reflects our ability to increase our prices in a world where inflation is still present.In terms of operating costs  payroll rose by 2.7%  due to the full-year impact of (i) recruitments carried out in 2022 to cope with growth (ii) the salary increases granted last year. The ratio of payroll to gross margin rose to 70% from 68% last year  but remains significantly lower than the pre-pandemic situation (above 72% in 2019). Our cautious approach to operating costs in the first half is beginning to bear fruit and will produce its full effect on profitability in the second half.Overheads rose by €7 million  i.e. an increase of 7.1% year-on-year  mainly due to (i) a catch-up in current IT and technology expenditure and (ii) an increase in travel expenses. The ratio of overheads to gross profit is down in the first half to 14.7% from 13.6% last year  but here again  this ratio remains significantly lower than in 2019 (18.3%).""Other operating income and expenses""  which mainly consists of severance costs  has a negative balance of €9.7 million  up €8 million on the previous year  reflecting the reorganization made necessary by the slowdown in certain businesses.Overall  the operating margin for the first half of 2023 is 8.7%  down 260 basis points compared to the same period last year.Net interest expense amounted to €6.6 million  compared to €6.2 million last year  reflecting the impact of the rise in benchmark rates on variable interest expense  offset by higher interest on the Group's cash investment. Note that at June 30  2023  80% of gross debt is at a fixed rate.The effective tax rate is 25.8%  compared to 25.3% last year.Net profit attributable to the owner of the parent is €56 million compared to €85 million in the first half of 2022.Adjusted net profit attributable to the owner of the parent is also down at €70 million compared to €98 million last year.Financial structureCash flow from operations stands at €137 million compared to €172 million in the first half of 2022  a drop of €35 million euros  in line with the fall in pre-tax net income.Working capital requirements showed a negative variation of €28 million in the first half  consistent with the negative variation of €22 million in the first half of 2022.Investments in property  plant and equipment and intangible assets consist mainly of investments in IT infrastructure and technology  and amounted to€27 million in the first half.Overall  free cash flow from operating activities is €24 million  compared to €53 million last year.In terms of non-current investments  Ipsos invested around €5.5 million in the first half  notably in the acquisition of the Xperiti platform in the United States to strengthen its B2B research capacity  and of Focus RX  a pharmaceutical research company in China.Lastly  financing operations for the first half of 2023 include the following:- the continuation of our share buyback program for cancellation purposes for€27 million and €36 million of share buy-backs under the usual bonus share plans- repayment of a Schuldschein loan for €30 millionShareholders' equity stood at €1 359 million at June 30  2023 compared to €1 500 million at December 31  2022.Net financial debt amounted to €129 million  up compared to December 31  2022 (€69 million) and down from June 30  2022 (154 million euros). The leverage ratio (calculated excluding the IFRS 16 impact) was 0.4 times EBITDA (compared to 0.2 times at December 31  2022 and 0.4 times at June 30  2022).Cash position. Cash at June 30  2023 amounted to €301 million compared to €386 million at December 31  2022.The Group also has nearly €500 million in credit lines available for more than one year  enabling it to meet its €48 million debt repayments in 2023 and 2024.Also  with a view to restituting value to shareholders  we are pursuing our share buy-back program for cancellation. We plan to buy back around €50 million euros this year.OUTLOOKAs we are in the midst of a recovery and our business is returning to its usual cyclical pattern  first-half results will be less than half of full-year 2023 results.The order book is a better forward-looking indicator. It continues to accelerate  with organic growth of 2.6% at the end of June (4.1% excluding the impact of Covid contracts)  thanks to 5.3% growth in the 2nd quarter alone.We are therefore seeing a lag between revenues and the order book  which can be explained by:The end of Covid contracts concentrated at the beginning of 2022The upturn in orders  which traditionally leads to a lag between the order book and revenuesMix effects linked to the good momentum of service lines whose average contract maturity is longer than that of the Group's other services (public affairs and brand health measurement).This lag between revenue growth (-1.1%) against order book growth (+2.6%) will automatically be absorbed in the second half of the year  leading to revenue growth catching up by 3.7%. This does not take into account the expected further acceleration in orders over the coming months.More fundamentally  we are now returning to a more usual annual pattern  both in terms of business and revenue. Historically  the first half of the year accounts for around 45% of full-year revenues and 26% of operating margin.This confirms what we anticipated in February: the business profile for 2023 will be the opposite of that for 2022  with revenues  operating margin and cash generation weaker in the first half and then much stronger in the second half. First-half results are in line with historical pre-pandemic benchmarks  as shown in the table below  which helps confirm this view.Acquisition rate of key financial aggregates at end-June(performance at end-June / annual performance)Average2017 - 2022 2023 (*) Order book 72% 73% Revenue 45% 45% Gross margin 46% 46% Operating margin 29% 29% (*) For 2023: results for the first half/annual objectivesThe return to a degree of cyclicality in our business  the expected acceleration in revenues on the back of a buoyant order book  and the full impact of our cautious approach to operating costs in the first half will lead to a significant improvement in our operating margin  net profit and cash generation in the second half of the year.All these factors mean that  against a backdrop of global uncertainty  we are maintaining our guidance for 2023  with organic growth of around 5% and an operating margin of around 13%. This is based in particular on our belief that business will rebound in the United States in the second half of the year.Against that  the euro’s currency appreciation against many other currencies  if it continues as it did at the start of the year  could have a downward effect on the Group’s consolidated revenues.* * *Presentation of the 2023 half-year results:Wednesday July 26 at 8:30 am at Ipsos headquarters  then at 4 pm a conference call in English.

Excluding the impact of these contracts  organic growth is close to 4%  and rebounded to 6% between the 1st and 2nd quarters on the back of good momentum in Continental  Western and Eastern Europe.Revenue in the Americas fell organically by nearly 3%. This reflects contrasting realities  with very good momentum in Latin America (organic growth above 8%) and a decline in sales of around 4% in North America  penalized compared to an excellent first half 2022 (16% organic growth in the region) by (i) the drop in demand from major Tech customers and (ii) contract delays in our Public Affairs business in the United States  linked in part to the debate in the second quarter on the US government spending cap.Finally  the Asia-Pacific region posted organic growth of 3%  with a clear upturn in the 2nd quarter (7% compared with -2% in the first quarter)  driven by very good momentum in India and Southeast Asia. As expected  business activity in China picked up in the second quarter (6.5%) following the end of the zero-Covid policy at the start of the year  but the rebound of the Chinese economy after the pandemic remains lower than that seen in the West after the lockdowns.PERFORMANCE BY AUDIENCEIn millions of Euros H1 2023 Contribution Organic growthH1 2023/H1 2022 Reminder: Organic growthH1 2022 vs H1 2021 Consumers1 513.2 47% 3% 14% Clients and employees2 240.1 22% 0.5% 9% Citizens3 163.9 15% -12.5% -12% Doctors and patients4 169.9 16% -3% 8% Revenue 1 087.1 100% -1.1% 6.9%Breakdown of Service Lines by audience segment:1- Brand Health Tracking  Creative Excellence  Innovation  Ipsos UU  Ipsos MMA  Market Strategy & Understanding  Observer (excl. public sector)  Social Intelligence Analytics  Strategy32- Automotive & Mobility Development  Audience Measurement  Customer Experience  Channel Performance (Mystery Shopping and Shopper)  Media development  ERM  Capabilities3- Public Affairs  Corporate Reputation4- Pharma (quantitative and qualitative)Our Consumer business rebounded in the 2nd quarter (+5%) and posted organic growth of 3% in the first half  on top of 14% last year. The excellent performance of our brand health monitoring  marketing spend optimization and market positioning activities reflects our clients’ need to continue to understand consumer behavior in a complex  ever-changing world that is increasingly difficult to decipher.Our business with Clients and employees is stable overall  following strong growth last year. Our service lines dedicated to customer experience and channel performance evaluation are showing very good momentum  as economies re-open fully and travel returns but this audience segment is penalized by the decline in demand from Big Tech clients.Work among Citizens fell by over 12%  reflecting the end of Covid contracts. Underlying revenue excluding Covid public sector contracts grew organically by 3.5%. The need for governments and institutions to understand the dynamics of public opinion and the expectations of citizens is important in a context marked by multiple crises: geopolitical  democratic  economic and ecological.Lastly  our business with doctors and patients stabilized in the second quarter and posted an organic decline of 3% for the first half as a whole. Business suffered from delays in decision-making by certain pharmaceutical industry customers  who have suffered extended delays in the approval of new drugs  and a wide range of restructuring post pandemic. That said  sales momentum is good  and the order book for our healthcare business line has grown organically close to 9% since January. We are also pleased to announce the appointment of Bonnie Bain as the new head of this service line  whose experience will enable us to accelerate our development with customers in the healthcare sector.Overall growth in the 1st half should be assessed in the light of a number of factors:Firstly  the excellent performance achieved in the 1 st half of 2022  which led to unfavorable base effects. As a result  revenue for the 1 st half of 2023 is almost €100 million higher than for the first half of 2021  representing organic growth of 6% over 2 years.half of 2022  which led to unfavorable base effects. As a result  revenue for the 1 half of 2023 is almost €100 million higher than for the first half of 2021  representing organic growth of 6% over 2 years. Secondly  the impact of the end of the major Covid pandemic monitoring contracts  mainly in the first quarter. Excluding the impact of these contracts  underlying business for the first half rose organically by 1.1%.Lastly  the decline in business from major Tech customers undergoing restructuring (down 18% in the first half compared with the same period last year). These customers experienced exceptional growth during the pandemic  before entering a period of uncertainty from last summer onwards. To date  the situation of these customers is varied: while demand for studies has rebounded in some cases  it remains low in others. We have a number of major contracts under discussion  both for traditional activities (product testing  brand health research  mystery shopping  etc.) and for numerous opportunities linked to generative artificial intelligence. We therefore expect a recovery in the coming months  but the timing remains uncertain.FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE FOR THE FIRST HALFSummary income statementIn millions of Euros June 30  2023 June 30  2022 Change ReminderDec. 31  2022 Revenue 1 087.1 1 121.7 -3.1% 2 405.3 Gross margin 736.1 739.7 -0.5% 1 594.1 Gross margin / revenue 67.7% 65.9% 66.3% Operating margin 94.3 126.8 -25.6% 314.7 Operating margin / revenue 8.7% 11.3% 13.1% Other non-recurring / recurring income and expenses (0.9) 0.9 3.7 Finance costs (6.6) (6.2) (13.2) Tax (20.9) (29.5) (72.8) Net profit attributable to the owner of the parent 56.4 85.5 215.2 Adjusted net profit* attributable to the owner of the parent 70.1 97.5 -28.1% 232.3*Adjusted net income is calculated before (i) non-cash items related to IFRS 2 (share-based payment)  (ii) amortization of acquisition-related intangibles (customer relations)  (iii) the impact net of tax of other non-recurring income and expenses  (iv) non-cash impacts on changes in puts in other financial income and expenses and (v) before deferred tax liabilities related to goodwill for which amortization is deductible in certain countries.The gross margin (which is calculated by deducting external and variable costs associated with contract performance from revenue) is up 180 basis points to 67.7% compared to 65.9% for last year at this point. This increase in the gross margin ratio reflects change in the mix of data collection methods  and can be explained by (i) the end of major pandemic monitoring contracts (whose collection costs were higher than the average) (ii) the increase in the proportion of online surveys (even though the post-pandemic upturn in business has resulted in a resumption of offline surveys in less digitalized countries such as India) (iii)  a mix effect linked to the strong growth of our activity in marketing spend optimization and advisory work which does not require data collection and whose gross margin is significantly higher than that of the rest of the Group. Lastly  the increase in gross margin in the first half also reflects our ability to increase our prices in a world where inflation is still present.In terms of operating costs  payroll rose by 2.7%  due to the full-year impact of (i) recruitments carried out in 2022 to cope with growth (ii) the salary increases granted last year. The ratio of payroll to gross margin rose to 70% from 68% last year  but remains significantly lower than the pre-pandemic situation (above 72% in 2019). Our cautious approach to operating costs in the first half is beginning to bear fruit and will produce its full effect on profitability in the second half.Overheads rose by €7 million  i.e. an increase of 7.1% year-on-year  mainly due to (i) a catch-up in current IT and technology expenditure and (ii) an increase in travel expenses. The ratio of overheads to gross profit is down in the first half to 14.7% from 13.6% last year  but here again  this ratio remains significantly lower than in 2019 (18.3%).""Other operating income and expenses""  which mainly consists of severance costs  has a negative balance of €9.7 million  up €8 million on the previous year  reflecting the reorganization made necessary by the slowdown in certain businesses.Overall  the operating margin for the first half of 2023 is 8.7%  down 260 basis points compared to the same period last year.Net interest expense amounted to €6.6 million  compared to €6.2 million last year  reflecting the impact of the rise in benchmark rates on variable interest expense  offset by higher interest on the Group's cash investment. Note that at June 30  2023  80% of gross debt is at a fixed rate.The effective tax rate is 25.8%  compared to 25.3% last year.Net profit attributable to the owner of the parent is €56 million compared to €85 million in the first half of 2022.Adjusted net profit attributable to the owner of the parent is also down at €70 million compared to €98 million last year.Financial structureCash flow from operations stands at €137 million compared to €172 million in the first half of 2022  a drop of €35 million euros  in line with the fall in pre-tax net income.Working capital requirements showed a negative variation of €28 million in the first half  consistent with the negative variation of €22 million in the first half of 2022.Investments in property  plant and equipment and intangible assets consist mainly of investments in IT infrastructure and technology  and amounted to€27 million in the first half.Overall  free cash flow from operating activities is €24 million  compared to €53 million last year.In terms of non-current investments  Ipsos invested around €5.5 million in the first half  notably in the acquisition of the Xperiti platform in the United States to strengthen its B2B research capacity  and of Focus RX  a pharmaceutical research company in China.Lastly  financing operations for the first half of 2023 include the following:- the continuation of our share buyback program for cancellation purposes for€27 million and €36 million of share buy-backs under the usual bonus share plans- repayment of a Schuldschein loan for €30 millionShareholders' equity stood at €1 359 million at June 30  2023 compared to €1 500 million at December 31  2022.Net financial debt amounted to €129 million  up compared to December 31  2022 (€69 million) and down from June 30  2022 (154 million euros). The leverage ratio (calculated excluding the IFRS 16 impact) was 0.4 times EBITDA (compared to 0.2 times at December 31  2022 and 0.4 times at June 30  2022).Cash position. Cash at June 30  2023 amounted to €301 million compared to €386 million at December 31  2022.The Group also has nearly €500 million in credit lines available for more than one year  enabling it to meet its €48 million debt repayments in 2023 and 2024.Also  with a view to restituting value to shareholders  we are pursuing our share buy-back program for cancellation. We plan to buy back around €50 million euros this year.OUTLOOKAs we are in the midst of a recovery and our business is returning to its usual cyclical pattern  first-half results will be less than half of full-year 2023 results.The order book is a better forward-looking indicator. It continues to accelerate  with organic growth of 2.6% at the end of June (4.1% excluding the impact of Covid contracts)  thanks to 5.3% growth in the 2nd quarter alone.We are therefore seeing a lag between revenues and the order book  which can be explained by:The end of Covid contracts concentrated at the beginning of 2022The upturn in orders  which traditionally leads to a lag between the order book and revenuesMix effects linked to the good momentum of service lines whose average contract maturity is longer than that of the Group's other services (public affairs and brand health measurement).This lag between revenue growth (-1.1%) against order book growth (+2.6%) will automatically be absorbed in the second half of the year  leading to revenue growth catching up by 3.7%. This does not take into account the expected further acceleration in orders over the coming months.More fundamentally  we are now returning to a more usual annual pattern  both in terms of business and revenue. Historically  the first half of the year accounts for around 45% of full-year revenues and 26% of operating margin.This confirms what we anticipated in February: the business profile for 2023 will be the opposite of that for 2022  with revenues  operating margin and cash generation weaker in the first half and then much stronger in the second half. First-half results are in line with historical pre-pandemic benchmarks  as shown in the table below  which helps confirm this view.Acquisition rate of key financial aggregates at end-June(performance at end-June / annual performance)Average2017 - 2022 2023 (*) Order book 72% 73% Revenue 45% 45% Gross margin 46% 46% Operating margin 29% 29% (*) For 2023: results for the first half/annual objectivesThe return to a degree of cyclicality in our business  the expected acceleration in revenues on the back of a buoyant order book  and the full impact of our cautious approach to operating costs in the first half will lead to a significant improvement in our operating margin  net profit and cash generation in the second half of the year.All these factors mean that  against a backdrop of global uncertainty  we are maintaining our guidance for 2023  with organic growth of around 5% and an operating margin of around 13%. This is based in particular on our belief that business will rebound in the United States in the second half of the year.Against that  the euro’s currency appreciation against many other currencies  if it continues as it did at the start of the year  could have a downward effect on the Group’s consolidated revenues.* * *Presentation of the 2023 half-year results:Wednesday July 26 at 8:30 am at Ipsos headquarters  then at 4 pm a conference call in English.

Such forward-looking statements are based on Dassault Systèmes management's current views and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Actual results or performances may differ materially from those in such statements due to a range of factors.The Group’s actual results or performance may be materially negatively affected by numerous risks and uncertainties  as described in the “Risk Factors” section 1.9 of the 2022 Universal Registration Document (‘Document d'enregistrement universel’) filed with the AMF (French Financial Markets Authority) on March 17  2023  available on the Group’s website www.3ds.com.In particular  please refer to the risk factor “Uncertain Global Economic Environment” in section 1.9.1.1 of the 2022 Universal Registration Document set out below for ease of reference:“In light of the uncertainties regarding economic  business  social  health and geopolitical conditions at the global level  Dassault Systèmes’ revenue  net earnings and cash flows may grow more slowly  whether on an annual or quarterly basis  mainly due to the following factors:the deployment of Dassault Systèmes’ solutions may represent a large portion of a customer’s investments in software technology. Decisions to make such an investment are impacted by the economic environment in which the customers operate. Uncertain global geopolitical  economic and health conditions and the lack of visibility or the lack of financial resources may cause some customers  e.g. within the automotive  aerospace  energy or natural resources industries  to reduce  postpone or terminate their investments  or to reduce or not renew ongoing paid maintenance for their installed base  which impact larger customers’ revenue with their respective sub-contractors;the political  economic and monetary situation in certain geographic regions where Dassault Systèmes operates could become more volatile and impact Dassault Systèmes’ business  for example  due to stricter export compliance rules or the introduction of new customs tariffs;continued pressure or volatility on raw materials and energy prices could also slow down Dassault Systèmes’ diversification efforts in new industries;uncertainties regarding the extent and duration of inflation could adversely affect the financial position of Dassault Systèmes; andthe sales cycle of the Dassault Systèmes’ products – already relatively long due to the strategic nature of such investments for customers – could further lengthen.The occurrence of crises – health and political crises in particular – could have consequences both for the health and safety of Dassault Systèmes’ employees and for the Company. It could also adversely impact the financial situation or financing and supply capabilities of Dassault Systèmes’ existing and potential customers  commercial and technology partners  some of whom may be forced to temporarily close sites or cease operations. A deteriorating economic environment could generate increased price pressure and affect the collection of receivables  which would negatively impact Dassault Systèmes’ revenue  financial performance and market position.Dassault Systèmes makes every effort to take into consideration this uncertain macroeconomic outlook. Dassault Systèmes’ business results  however  may not develop as anticipated. Furthermore  due to factors affecting sales of Dassault Systèmes’ products and services  there may be a substantial time lag between an improvement in global economic and business conditions and an upswing in the Company’s business results.”In preparing such forward-looking statements  the Group has in particular assumed an average US dollar to euro exchange rate of US$1.10 per €1.00 as well as an average Japanese yen to euro exchange rate of JPY140.0 to €1.00  before hedging for the third quarter 2023. The Group has in particular assumed an average US dollar to euro exchange rate of US$1.09 per €1.00 as well as an average Japanese yen to euro exchange rate of JPY142.9 to €1.00  before hedging for the full year 2023. However  currency values fluctuate  and the Group’s results may be significantly affected by changes in exchange rates.Non-IFRS Financial InformationReaders are cautioned that the supplemental non-IFRS financial information presented in this press release is subject to inherent limitations. It is not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for IFRS measurements. The supplemental non-IFRS financial information should be read only in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS.

The tables also set forth the most comparable IFRS financial measure and reconciliations of this information with non-IFRS information.FOR MORE INFORMATIONDassault Systèmes’ 3DEXPERIENCE platform  3D design software  3D Digital Mock Up and Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) solutions: http://www.3ds.comABOUT DASSAULT SYSTÈMESDassault Systèmes  the 3DEXPERIENCE® Company  is a catalyst for human progress.

The Group believes it is helpful to evaluate its growth exclusive of currency impacts  particularly to help understand revenue trends in its business. Therefore  the Group provides percentage increases or decreases in its revenue and expenses (in both IFRS as well as non-IFRS) to eliminate the effect of changes in currency values  particularly the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen  relative to the euro. When trend information is expressed “in constant currencies”  the results of the “prior” period have first been recalculated using the average exchange rates of the comparable period in the current year  and then compared with the results of the comparable period in the current year.While constant currency calculations are not considered to be an IFRS measure  the Group believes these measures are critical to understanding its global revenue results and to compare with many of its competitors who report their financial results in U.S. dollars. Therefore  Dassault Systèmes includes this calculation for comparing IFRS revenue figures as well non-IFRS revenue figures for comparable periods. All information at constant exchange rates is expressed as a rounded percentage and therefore may not precisely reflect the absolute figures.Information on Growth excluding acquisitions (“organic growth”)In addition to financial indicators on the entire Group’s scope  Dassault Systèmes provides growth excluding acquisitions effect  also named organic growth. In order to do so  the data relating to the scope is restated excluding acquisitions  from the date of the transaction  over a period of 12 months.Information on Industrial SectorsDassault Systèmes’ Industries develop Industry Solution Experiences  offerings specifically designed to deliver value to companies and users in a particular industry.

This reflects an improving momentum  putting us on the trajectory to achieve our full-year objectives. Second quarter total revenue and software revenue grew 8%  well-aligned with our objectives  driven by strength across multiple industries  product lines and geographies.From a profitability perspective  we outperformed our second quarter objectives  while continuing to invest in our long-term growth. Diluted EPS grew 7% as reported and 15% at constant currency to €0.28. We reported an operating margin of 31%. Year-to-date cash flow from operations totaled €1.03 billion.For the full year 2023  we are reaffirming our objectives of revenue growth of 8% to 9% and diluted earnings per share of €1.18 to €1.20. We are well-positioned for growth acceleration  supported by a robust pipeline and broad-based growth contribution from key industries and geographies.”Financial Objectives for 2023Dassault Systèmes’ third quarter and 2023 financial objectives presented below are given on a non-IFRS basis and reflect the principal 2023 currency exchange rate assumptions for the US dollar and Japanese yen as well as the potential impact from additional non-Euro currencies:Q3 2023 FY 2023 Total Revenue (billion) €1.402 - €1.424 €5.940 - €5.990 Growth 2 - 4% 5 - 6% Growth ex FX 8 - 10% 8 - 9% Software revenue growth * 9 - 10% 8 - 9% Of which licenses and other software revenue growth * 6 - 10% 2 - 5% Of which recurring revenue growth * ~ 10% 10 - 11% Services revenue growth * 2 - 5% 5 - 7% Operating Margin 30.2% - 30.5% 32.3% - 32.6% EPS Diluted €0.26 - €0.27 €1.18 - €1.20 Growth 1 - 3% 4 - 6% Growth ex FX 8 - 10% 8 - 10% US dollar $1.10 per Euro $1.09 per Euro Japanese yen (before hedging) JPY 140.0 per Euro JPY 142.9 per Euro * Growth in Constant CurrenciesThese objectives are prepared and communicated only on a non-IFRS basis and are subject to the cautionary statement set forth below.The 2023 non-IFRS financial objectives set forth above do not take into account the following accounting elements below and are estimated based upon the 2023 principal currency exchange rates above: no significant contract liabilities write-downs; share-based compensation expenses  including related social charges  estimated at approximately €241 million (these estimates do not include any new stock option or share grants issued after June 30  2023); amortization of acquired intangibles and of tangibles reevaluation  estimated at approximately €375 million  largely impacted by the acquisition of Medidata; and lease incentives of acquired companies at approximately €3 million.The above objectives also do not include any impact from other operating income and expenses  net principally comprised of acquisition  integration and restructuring expenses  and impairment of goodwill and acquired intangible assets; from one-time items included in financial revenue; from one-time tax effects; and from the income tax effects of these non-IFRS adjustments.

Such forward-looking statements are based on Dassault Systèmes management's current views and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Actual results or performances may differ materially from those in such statements due to a range of factors.The Group’s actual results or performance may be materially negatively affected by numerous risks and uncertainties  as described in the “Risk Factors” section 1.9 of the 2022 Universal Registration Document (‘Document d'enregistrement universel’) filed with the AMF (French Financial Markets Authority) on March 17  2023  available on the Group’s website www.3ds.com.In particular  please refer to the risk factor “Uncertain Global Economic Environment” in section 1.9.1.1 of the 2022 Universal Registration Document set out below for ease of reference:“In light of the uncertainties regarding economic  business  social  health and geopolitical conditions at the global level  Dassault Systèmes’ revenue  net earnings and cash flows may grow more slowly  whether on an annual or quarterly basis  mainly due to the following factors:the deployment of Dassault Systèmes’ solutions may represent a large portion of a customer’s investments in software technology. Decisions to make such an investment are impacted by the economic environment in which the customers operate. Uncertain global geopolitical  economic and health conditions and the lack of visibility or the lack of financial resources may cause some customers  e.g. within the automotive  aerospace  energy or natural resources industries  to reduce  postpone or terminate their investments  or to reduce or not renew ongoing paid maintenance for their installed base  which impact larger customers’ revenue with their respective sub-contractors;the political  economic and monetary situation in certain geographic regions where Dassault Systèmes operates could become more volatile and impact Dassault Systèmes’ business  for example  due to stricter export compliance rules or the introduction of new customs tariffs;continued pressure or volatility on raw materials and energy prices could also slow down Dassault Systèmes’ diversification efforts in new industries;uncertainties regarding the extent and duration of inflation could adversely affect the financial position of Dassault Systèmes; andthe sales cycle of the Dassault Systèmes’ products – already relatively long due to the strategic nature of such investments for customers – could further lengthen.The occurrence of crises – health and political crises in particular – could have consequences both for the health and safety of Dassault Systèmes’ employees and for the Company. It could also adversely impact the financial situation or financing and supply capabilities of Dassault Systèmes’ existing and potential customers  commercial and technology partners  some of whom may be forced to temporarily close sites or cease operations. A deteriorating economic environment could generate increased price pressure and affect the collection of receivables  which would negatively impact Dassault Systèmes’ revenue  financial performance and market position.Dassault Systèmes makes every effort to take into consideration this uncertain macroeconomic outlook. Dassault Systèmes’ business results  however  may not develop as anticipated. Furthermore  due to factors affecting sales of Dassault Systèmes’ products and services  there may be a substantial time lag between an improvement in global economic and business conditions and an upswing in the Company’s business results.”In preparing such forward-looking statements  the Group has in particular assumed an average US dollar to euro exchange rate of US$1.10 per €1.00 as well as an average Japanese yen to euro exchange rate of JPY140.0 to €1.00  before hedging for the third quarter 2023. The Group has in particular assumed an average US dollar to euro exchange rate of US$1.09 per €1.00 as well as an average Japanese yen to euro exchange rate of JPY142.9 to €1.00  before hedging for the full year 2023. However  currency values fluctuate  and the Group’s results may be significantly affected by changes in exchange rates.Non-IFRS Financial InformationReaders are cautioned that the supplemental non-IFRS financial information presented in this press release is subject to inherent limitations. It is not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for IFRS measurements. The supplemental non-IFRS financial information should be read only in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS.

Specific limitations for individual non-IFRS measures are set forth in the Company’s 2022 Universal Registration Document filed with the AMF on March 17  2023.In the tables accompanying this press release the Group sets forth its supplemental non-IFRS figures for revenue  operating income  operating margin  net income and diluted earnings per share  which exclude the effect of adjusting the carrying value of acquired companies’ deferred revenue  share-based compensation expense and related social charges  the amortization of acquired intangible assets and of tangibles reevaluation  certain other operating income and expense  net  including impairment of goodwill and acquired intangibles  the effect of adjusting lease incentives of acquired companies  certain one-time items included in financial revenue and other  net  and the income tax effect of the non-IFRS adjustments and certain one-time tax effects. The tables also set forth the most comparable IFRS financial measure and reconciliations of this information with non-IFRS information.FOR MORE INFORMATIONDassault Systèmes’ 3DEXPERIENCE platform  3D design software  3D Digital Mock Up and Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) solutions: http://www.3ds.comABOUT DASSAULT SYSTÈMESDassault Systèmes  the 3DEXPERIENCE® Company  is a catalyst for human progress.

The Group believes it is helpful to evaluate its growth exclusive of currency impacts  particularly to help understand revenue trends in its business. Therefore  the Group provides percentage increases or decreases in its revenue and expenses (in both IFRS as well as non-IFRS) to eliminate the effect of changes in currency values  particularly the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen  relative to the euro. When trend information is expressed “in constant currencies”  the results of the “prior” period have first been recalculated using the average exchange rates of the comparable period in the current year  and then compared with the results of the comparable period in the current year.While constant currency calculations are not considered to be an IFRS measure  the Group believes these measures are critical to understanding its global revenue results and to compare with many of its competitors who report their financial results in U.S. dollars. Therefore  Dassault Systèmes includes this calculation for comparing IFRS revenue figures as well non-IFRS revenue figures for comparable periods. All information at constant exchange rates is expressed as a rounded percentage and therefore may not precisely reflect the absolute figures.Information on Growth excluding acquisitions (“organic growth”)In addition to financial indicators on the entire Group’s scope  Dassault Systèmes provides growth excluding acquisitions effect  also named organic growth. In order to do so  the data relating to the scope is restated excluding acquisitions  from the date of the transaction  over a period of 12 months.Information on Industrial SectorsDassault Systèmes’ Industries develop Industry Solution Experiences  offerings specifically designed to deliver value to companies and users in a particular industry.

However  there were still signs of a more subdued investment environment  with funds raised through ""further issues"" — additional share offerings to raise more cash — down 36% to £3.65 billion.The number of companies listing across the main and smaller alternative investment (AIM) markets in London fell to 17 from 29. The figures are dwarfed by the frenzy of activity in 2021  which saw 48 London listings in the first half and a total of £19.8 billion raised.Elsewhere  funds raised (the amount of cash companies earn when they list on an exchange) fell 86.9% on the Nasdaq Nordic  and dried up completely on the Euronext Amsterdam.Meanwhile  the Euronext Milan index and the German Deutsche Börse were both boosted by significant listings  the former by the 600 million euro ($664.2 million) initial public offering of Italian gambling firm Lottomatica in May — the biggest in Europe in the year so far. Germany's index benefitted from the 388.5 million euro IPO of cloud computing firm IONOS Group.""The LSE has demonstrated a greater resilience between H1'22 and H1'23 than many of its European counterparts.
