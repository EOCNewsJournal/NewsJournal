28250,Clearstream,Bing API,https://www.tradersmagazine.com/xtra/canada-modernizes-collateral-and-funding-infrastructure/,Canada Modernizes Collateral and Funding Infrastructure,TMX Group  the Canadian exchange operator and infrastructure provider  and Clearstream Banking are launching the Canadian Collateral Management Service (CCMS) to bring automation and increase collateral mobility.,TMX Group  the Canadian exchange operator and infrastructure provider  and Clearstream Banking are launching the Canadian Collateral Management Service (CCMS) to bring automation and increase collateral mobility.In May this year TMX Group and Clearstream Banking  the international central securities depository of Deutsche Börse Group  announced plans to develop and deliver CCMS  which will include the introduction of Canada’s first domestic triparty repo capability.Kevin Sampson  president of Canadian Depository for Securities  told Markets Media that the collateral and funding infrastructure in Canada is in need of modernization and the market is looking to TMX to solve for that gap.Kevin Sampson  TMXHe said: “There are a lot of inefficiencies due to operationally heavy and manual processes and CCMS will bring end-to-end automation and increase collateral mobility.”TMX started looking at this problem about two years ago and engaged the market on their needs for different features  design and solutions. The group reviewed a variety of partners to find a state of the art globally recognised leader in collateral management and Sampson said Clearstream was the obvious partner in terms of their capabilities  reputation and willingness to work with TMX in the Canadian market.“The needs for collateral funding and mobility are fairly common across jurisdictions so Clearstream was a good fit for our market with their technology requiring minimal customization or bespoke adoption ” Sampson added. “The technology integration has been fairly seamless and the market has already been very supportive and provided a lot of validation.”He continued that the benefits of CCMS include delivering increased liquidity to the market  while minimizing exposures and risk. Better optimization of collateral and capital  and minimizing over-collateralization  frees up capital that can be re-deployed and increases the velocity and magnitude of liquidity.CCMS is targeted for launch in the third quarter of this year and will be rolled out in phases. The first phase will be introducing CCMS in the repo market and the Canadian Derivatives Clearing Corporation  CDCC  has a new collateralized note which will support the new platform. CCMS will then be extended into stock loan and borrow and then securities lending.TMX is looking at opening up the test environment in the summer to allow clients to start onboarding and connect  and Sampson also expects some clients will go live on the service in the summer.The CCMS platform will initially be a domestic solution to cover securities that are eligible in the CSD in Canada.“We have aspirations for international securities and Clearstream has a global presence that will provide opportunities in a later phase ” added Sampson.T+1The US is shortening its securities settlement cycle from two days after a trade  T+2  to T+1 on 28 May 2024. Canada will also go live with cutting its settlement cycle to T+1 on the previous day  27 May 2024. The CCMS will also support the industry shift to T+1 by introducing increased efficiencies and collateral mobility  while reducing operational risk.Canada recognised the need for new critical infrastructure in the collateral and security funding market for quite some time and the project was initiated well before the T+1 discussions according to Sampson.“CCMS provides an instantaneous triparty service because it is integrated with the Canadian central securities depository (CSD)  which also provides a lot of advantages in a T+1 environment ” he added.Samuel Riley  ClearstreamSam Riley  chief executive of Clearstream Securities Services  said in a statement: “CCMS will deliver increased liquidity and efficiency while minimizing exposures  supporting the Canadian market on its endeavor to move to T+1. Clients will also benefit from Clearstream’s industry-leading technology and digital innovation  such as the cloud-based  digital collateral schedule capability known as OSCAR.”Sampson continued that TMX is also seeing a lot of demand to bring securities lending onto CCMS early next year prior to T+1.The Canadian CSD is already T+1 compatible and there are ETFs and money market instruments that can customize settlements on a T+1 basis  but Sampson said it is extremely minimal.“Market participants are doing most of the heavy lifting in terms of creating more automation in their workflows to accommodate a shorter settlement cycle and our systems will be ready for testing ” he added.TMX also has another very significant project to upgrade and modernize the technology platform of Canada’s domestic central securities depository (CSD) by the end of next year in parallel with CCMS.“I think it is a testament to our focus on ensuring that we are supporting critical infrastructure for the Canadian market ” said Sampson.John McKenzie  TMXJohn McKenzie  chief executive of TMX Group  spoke about the changes in the post-trade modernization project in the first quarter results call in May.McKenzie said: “As a result of the acceleration of the implementation of T+1 to May 28  2024  and recognizing that it is a market priority  we’ll be entering a slowdown period until after the industry transition. We are currently targeting a revised launch in Q4 of 2024  while being mindful that this timing may change if there is a significant industry-wide delay in the implementation of the move to T+1 settlement.”,neutral,0.06,0.94,0.01,positive,0.65,0.33,0.02,True,English,"['Funding Infrastructure', 'Canada', 'Collateral', 'cloud-based, digital collateral schedule capability', 'first domestic triparty repo capability', 'Canadian Derivatives Clearing Corporation', 'first quarter results call', 'Deutsche Börse Group', 'domestic central securities depository', 'international central securities depository', 'Canadian central securities depository', 'Canadian Collateral Management Service', 'instantaneous triparty service', 'Canadian exchange operator', 'new collateralized note', 'shorter settlement cycle', 'securities settlement cycle', 'money market instruments', 'new critical infrastructure', 'security funding market', 'Clearstream Securities Services', 'post-trade modernization project', 'The Canadian CSD', 'Canadian Depository', 'The CCMS platform', 'first phase', 'domestic solution', 'international securities', 'digital innovation', 'repo market', 'third quarter', 'new platform', 'Canadian market', 'funding infrastructure', 'collateral funding', 'securities lending', 'The US', 'infrastructure provider', 'technology platform', 'Markets Media', 'manual processes', 'different features', 'obvious partner', 'good fit', 'minimal customization', 'bespoke adoption', 'Better optimization', 'stock loan', 'test environment', 'global presence', 'later phase', 'two days', 'previous day', 'industry shift', 'Samuel Riley', 'Sam Riley', 'chief executive', 'significant project', 'collateral mobility', 'technology integration', 'industry-leading technology', 'Market participants', 'increased efficiencies', 'John McKenzie', 'Clearstream Banking', 'operational risk', 'heavy lifting', 'next year', 'TMX Group', 'T+1 discussions', 'T+1 environment', 'T+1 basis', 'Kevin Sampson', 'increased liquidity', 'end automation', 'May', 'plans', 'introduction', 'Canada', 'president', 'need', 'gap', 'lot', 'inefficiencies', 'problem', 'design', 'solutions', 'variety', 'partners', 'state', 'leader', 'terms', 'capabilities', 'reputation', 'willingness', 'jurisdictions', 'validation', 'benefits', 'exposures', 'capital', 'collateralization', 'velocity', 'magnitude', 'launch', 'phases', 'CDCC', 'summer', 'clients', 'aspirations', 'opportunities', 'time', 'advantages', 'efficiency', 'endeavor', 'OSCAR', 'demand', 'ETFs', 'settlements', 'workflows', 'systems', 'testing', 'parallel', 'testament', 'focus', 'changes', 'acceleration', 'implementation']",2023-07-27,2023-07-27,tradersmagazine.com

The company had originally forecast a consolidated profit before taxes of around EUR 6.6 million for 2023. Based on current projections  consolidated profit before taxes is now expected to be approximately EUR 4.7 million. DF Deutsche Forfait AG also anticipates a lower business volume than in the previous year in the Marketing Service  Forfaiting and Factoring segments and currently expects a business volume of around EUR 40.0 million in the new Trading segment. According to the current forecast  the gross result will be around 20% lower than previous year’s level of EUR 10.6 million. Originally  the company expected an increase. The forecast has to be adjusted primarily as a result of the ongoing special audit of Varengold Bank initiated by BaFin due to alleged compliance violations in connection with transactions with Iran. A major consequence is the uncertainty of market participants in DF Deutsche Forfait AG’s business area  which is currently impacting the company’s business activities.

The Outlook remains Positive. Concurrently  SCOPE has affirmed the ratings for senior unsecured debt at BBB-  subordinated (hybrid) debt at BB and short-term debt at S-2. This reflects Encavis' sustained robust liquidity and its diversified exposure to external funding channels  i.e.  from banks and capital markets at project level and from private sources (i.e.  shareholder loans and Schuldschein debt) and public sources at Group level. “SCOPE's renewed rating action reflects our solid business model  our profound risk management activities and our consistent financing policy  which we have pursued since 2016 with a clear focus on stable long-term balance sheet ratios. Based on that the Accelerated Growth Strategy 2027 will have an overall neutral impact on our business risk profile  and we will maintain our moderate credit metrics”  welcomes Dr Christoph Husmann  Spokesman of the Management Board and CFO of Encavis AG  the remaining 'Positive' Outlook. SCOPE states in its rating report that Encavis 'BBB-' rating primarily reflects the Company's largely protected position as an independent power producer (IPP) with own power generation portfolio that comprises more than 2.1 gigawatts (GW) across more than 200 renewable power plants. This is supplemented by about 1.4 GW in around 100 plants operated as part of its asset management for third parties across Western Europe (ESG factor: credit-positive environmental risk factor). The European energy crisis accelerated the expansion of Renewable Energy. European governments plan to reduce their dependence on Russian fossil fuels and fast forward the green transition. The private sector is likely to keep increasing its demand for renewable power  driving up power purchase agreements (PPAs). This trend is also supported by the phasing-out of subsidies for renewable power generation and high power prices compared to pre-crisis levels. High power prices are likely more than offset the combined effect on profitability of new projects stemming from high inflation and increased interest rates. SCOPE has the opinion that the decreasing share of subsidised projects will likely be compensated by growing outreach and improving granularity of Encavis' own portfolio. Encavis should be able to retain high profitability  e.g.  a SCOPE-adjusted EBITDA margin of above 60% despite some dilution driven by strong growth in lower margin photovoltaic services. Liquidity ratios are expected to stand comfortably at above 110% in the foreseeable future  supported by a large unrestricted cash cushion of EUR 408m at end of March 2023 and committed undrawn long-term credit lines of EUR 146m. SCOPE assumes that the amortisation of loans at project level (EUR 120m-130m yearly) can be sufficiently covered by the operating cash flow of the project companies. SCOPE maintains its neutral view of Encavis' financial policy  which should help the Company to keep growing while maintaining the quality of its financial risk profile. Encavis' healthy financial policy is evidenced by funding measures  such as the use of equity-like financing instruments  the flexible dividend policy going forward (as Encavis waived the dividend in 2023 for financial year 2022 to support its ambitious growth targets)  the wide use of financial covenants  cash reserves at project level and a minimum equity ratio of 24% (30.7% on 31st March 2023). The 'Positive' Outlook reflects SCOPE's expectation that SCOPE-adjusted EBITDA/interest cover will remain above 4.0x and SCOPE-adjusted debt/EBITDA below 7.0x over the next few years  supported by Encavis' gradually improving diversification. The Outlook also assumes a limited impact on credit metrics from adverse regulatory interventions. A rating upgrade could be warranted if Encavis maintained SCOPE-adjusted EBITDA/interest cover above 4.0x and SCOPE-adjusted debt/EBITDA were sustained at below 7.0x  together with further improvements in geographical diversification with a focus on jurisdictions with relatively stable regulatory environments and granularity of the own portfolio.

Encavis healthy financial policy is evidenced by funding measures  such as the use of equity-like financing instruments  the flexible dividend policy going forward (as Encavis waived the dividend in 2023 for financial year 2022 to support its ambitious growth targets)  the wide use of financial covenants  cash reserves at project level and a minimum equity ratio of 24% (30.7% on 31st March 2023).The Positive Outlook reflects SCOPEs expectation that SCOPE-adjusted EBITDA/interest cover will remain above 4.0x and SCOPE-adjusted debt/EBITDA below 7.0x over the next few years  supported by Encavis gradually improving diversification. The Outlook also assumes a limited impact on credit metrics from adverse regulatory interventions.A rating upgrade could be warranted if Encavis maintained SCOPE-adjusted EBITDA/interest cover above 4.0x and SCOPE-adjusted debt/EBITDA were sustained at below 7.0x  together with further improvements in geographical diversification with a focus on jurisdictions with relatively stable regulatory environments and granularity of the own portfolio.To see the updated issuer report  as well as the rating history including SCOPE's initial public rating on Encavis AG and its debt-issuing subsidiary Encavis Finance BV on March 18  2019  please click:https://scoperatings.com/ratings-and-research/rating/EN/174820https://www.scoperatings.com/ratings-and-research/issuer/339070About ENCAVIS:The Encavis AG (Prime Standard; ISIN: DE0006095003; ticker symbol: ECV) is a producer of electricity from Renewable Energies listed on the MDAX of Deutsche Börse AG.

28257,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://www.tradersmagazine.com/xtra/canada-modernizes-collateral-and-funding-infrastructure/,Canada Modernizes Collateral and Funding Infrastructure,TMX Group  the Canadian exchange operator and infrastructure provider  and Clearstream Banking are launching the Canadian Collateral Management Service (CCMS) to bring automation and increase collateral mobility.,TMX Group  the Canadian exchange operator and infrastructure provider  and Clearstream Banking are launching the Canadian Collateral Management Service (CCMS) to bring automation and increase collateral mobility.In May this year TMX Group and Clearstream Banking  the international central securities depository of Deutsche Börse Group  announced plans to develop and deliver CCMS  which will include the introduction of Canada’s first domestic triparty repo capability.Kevin Sampson  president of Canadian Depository for Securities  told Markets Media that the collateral and funding infrastructure in Canada is in need of modernization and the market is looking to TMX to solve for that gap.Kevin Sampson  TMXHe said: “There are a lot of inefficiencies due to operationally heavy and manual processes and CCMS will bring end-to-end automation and increase collateral mobility.”TMX started looking at this problem about two years ago and engaged the market on their needs for different features  design and solutions. The group reviewed a variety of partners to find a state of the art globally recognised leader in collateral management and Sampson said Clearstream was the obvious partner in terms of their capabilities  reputation and willingness to work with TMX in the Canadian market.“The needs for collateral funding and mobility are fairly common across jurisdictions so Clearstream was a good fit for our market with their technology requiring minimal customization or bespoke adoption ” Sampson added. “The technology integration has been fairly seamless and the market has already been very supportive and provided a lot of validation.”He continued that the benefits of CCMS include delivering increased liquidity to the market  while minimizing exposures and risk. Better optimization of collateral and capital  and minimizing over-collateralization  frees up capital that can be re-deployed and increases the velocity and magnitude of liquidity.CCMS is targeted for launch in the third quarter of this year and will be rolled out in phases. The first phase will be introducing CCMS in the repo market and the Canadian Derivatives Clearing Corporation  CDCC  has a new collateralized note which will support the new platform. CCMS will then be extended into stock loan and borrow and then securities lending.TMX is looking at opening up the test environment in the summer to allow clients to start onboarding and connect  and Sampson also expects some clients will go live on the service in the summer.The CCMS platform will initially be a domestic solution to cover securities that are eligible in the CSD in Canada.“We have aspirations for international securities and Clearstream has a global presence that will provide opportunities in a later phase ” added Sampson.T+1The US is shortening its securities settlement cycle from two days after a trade  T+2  to T+1 on 28 May 2024. Canada will also go live with cutting its settlement cycle to T+1 on the previous day  27 May 2024. The CCMS will also support the industry shift to T+1 by introducing increased efficiencies and collateral mobility  while reducing operational risk.Canada recognised the need for new critical infrastructure in the collateral and security funding market for quite some time and the project was initiated well before the T+1 discussions according to Sampson.“CCMS provides an instantaneous triparty service because it is integrated with the Canadian central securities depository (CSD)  which also provides a lot of advantages in a T+1 environment ” he added.Samuel Riley  ClearstreamSam Riley  chief executive of Clearstream Securities Services  said in a statement: “CCMS will deliver increased liquidity and efficiency while minimizing exposures  supporting the Canadian market on its endeavor to move to T+1. Clients will also benefit from Clearstream’s industry-leading technology and digital innovation  such as the cloud-based  digital collateral schedule capability known as OSCAR.”Sampson continued that TMX is also seeing a lot of demand to bring securities lending onto CCMS early next year prior to T+1.The Canadian CSD is already T+1 compatible and there are ETFs and money market instruments that can customize settlements on a T+1 basis  but Sampson said it is extremely minimal.“Market participants are doing most of the heavy lifting in terms of creating more automation in their workflows to accommodate a shorter settlement cycle and our systems will be ready for testing ” he added.TMX also has another very significant project to upgrade and modernize the technology platform of Canada’s domestic central securities depository (CSD) by the end of next year in parallel with CCMS.“I think it is a testament to our focus on ensuring that we are supporting critical infrastructure for the Canadian market ” said Sampson.John McKenzie  TMXJohn McKenzie  chief executive of TMX Group  spoke about the changes in the post-trade modernization project in the first quarter results call in May.McKenzie said: “As a result of the acceleration of the implementation of T+1 to May 28  2024  and recognizing that it is a market priority  we’ll be entering a slowdown period until after the industry transition. We are currently targeting a revised launch in Q4 of 2024  while being mindful that this timing may change if there is a significant industry-wide delay in the implementation of the move to T+1 settlement.”,neutral,0.06,0.94,0.01,positive,0.65,0.33,0.02,True,English,"['Funding Infrastructure', 'Canada', 'Collateral', 'cloud-based, digital collateral schedule capability', 'first domestic triparty repo capability', 'Canadian Derivatives Clearing Corporation', 'first quarter results call', 'Deutsche Börse Group', 'domestic central securities depository', 'international central securities depository', 'Canadian central securities depository', 'Canadian Collateral Management Service', 'instantaneous triparty service', 'Canadian exchange operator', 'new collateralized note', 'shorter settlement cycle', 'securities settlement cycle', 'money market instruments', 'new critical infrastructure', 'security funding market', 'Clearstream Securities Services', 'post-trade modernization project', 'The Canadian CSD', 'Canadian Depository', 'The CCMS platform', 'first phase', 'domestic solution', 'international securities', 'digital innovation', 'repo market', 'third quarter', 'new platform', 'Canadian market', 'funding infrastructure', 'collateral funding', 'securities lending', 'The US', 'infrastructure provider', 'technology platform', 'Markets Media', 'manual processes', 'different features', 'obvious partner', 'good fit', 'minimal customization', 'bespoke adoption', 'Better optimization', 'stock loan', 'test environment', 'global presence', 'later phase', 'two days', 'previous day', 'industry shift', 'Samuel Riley', 'Sam Riley', 'chief executive', 'significant project', 'collateral mobility', 'technology integration', 'industry-leading technology', 'Market participants', 'increased efficiencies', 'John McKenzie', 'Clearstream Banking', 'operational risk', 'heavy lifting', 'next year', 'TMX Group', 'T+1 discussions', 'T+1 environment', 'T+1 basis', 'Kevin Sampson', 'increased liquidity', 'end automation', 'May', 'plans', 'introduction', 'Canada', 'president', 'need', 'gap', 'lot', 'inefficiencies', 'problem', 'design', 'solutions', 'variety', 'partners', 'state', 'leader', 'terms', 'capabilities', 'reputation', 'willingness', 'jurisdictions', 'validation', 'benefits', 'exposures', 'capital', 'collateralization', 'velocity', 'magnitude', 'launch', 'phases', 'CDCC', 'summer', 'clients', 'aspirations', 'opportunities', 'time', 'advantages', 'efficiency', 'endeavor', 'OSCAR', 'demand', 'ETFs', 'settlements', 'workflows', 'systems', 'testing', 'parallel', 'testament', 'focus', 'changes', 'acceleration', 'implementation']",2023-07-27,2023-07-27,tradersmagazine.com

AMG has commenced an arbitration claim seeking compensatory damages  which include costs incurred and lost profitability.During the second quarter of 2023  a total of 28 870 dry metric tons (“dmt”) of lithium concentrates was sold. The second quarter experienced increased sales volumes due to shipping schedule variances which will negatively impact the third quarter. The average realized sales price was $3 633/dmt CIF China for the quarter. The average cost per ton for the quarter was $547/dmt CIF China. The cost per ton is higher than the first quarter due to lower volumes and pricing in tantalum concentrate in the quarter. The additional lithium concentrate shipments and slightly higher costs in tantalum concentrate resulted in quarterly EBITDA for AMG Brazil of $89 million.AMG Critical MineralsQ2 ‘23 Q2 ‘22 Change Revenue $57 271 $103 416 (45%) Gross profit 7 806 14 028 (44%) Operating profit 169 7 086 (98%) EBITDA 1 532 9 069 (83%)AMG Critical Minerals’ revenue for the second quarter of 2023 decreased by 45%  to $57 million  mainly due to lower volumes across the segment largely driven by the silicon metal plant operating one furnace during the quarter  as discussed in detail below. The segment also suffered from a slowdown in the European industrial economy.Gross profit of $8 million in the second quarter was 44% lower compared to the second quarter of 2022  largely due to the lower volumes in the current quarter.SG&A expenses in the second quarter of 2023 increased by 8%  to $8 million  compared to the same period in 2022. This was largely driven by higher professional fees in the current quarter.The second quarter 2023 EBITDA decreased 83% compared to the same period in 2022  to $2 million  due to the lower gross profit as noted above.AMG Silicon operated one of four furnaces throughout the second quarter and plans to operate one furnace for the remainder of 2023. The operational parameters of the silicon business will continue to be reviewed on an ongoing basis. Due to the noted interruptions in silicon operations  the financial impact of the business will be excluded from EBITDA during this period of abnormal operations. However  AMG Silicon generated $9 million in cash flow from operating activities during the quarter driven by the receipt of energy sales made in the fourth quarter of 2022.AMG Critical Materials TechnologiesQ2 ‘23 Q2 ‘22 Change Revenue $173 561 $160 916 8% Gross profit 23 743 27 391 (13%) Operating profit 3 620 8 456 (57%) EBITDA 9 947 13 825 (28%)AMG Critical Materials Technologies' second quarter 2023 revenue increased by $13 million  or 8%  compared to the same period in 2022. This improvement was driven by strong revenues in our engineering unit  as well as higher sales volumes of titanium alloys and chrome metal  partially offset by lower chrome metal pricing.SG&A expenses increased by 8% in the second quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022  due to additional personnel at AMG Engineering and AMG LIVA corresponding to the record order backlog and business development  respectively.AMG Critical Materials Technologies’ EBITDA was $10 million during the quarter compared to $14 million in the same period of 2022. The decrease was primarily due to lower chrome prices in the second quarter of 2023 partially offset by higher profitability in Engineering and Titanium.AMG Engineering signed $167 million in new orders during the second quarter of 2023  driven by strong orders of remelting and induction furnaces  representing a 2.48x book to bill ratio. Order backlog was $337 million as of June 30  2023  the highest in AMG’s history.Financial ReviewTaxAMG recorded an income tax expense of $27 million in the second quarter of 2023  compared to $23 million in the same period in 2022. This variance was mainly driven by higher profitability in AMG Lithium at its Brazil operation  offset by US tax expense and movements in the Brazilian real. The effects of the Brazilian real caused a $2 million tax benefit in the second quarter of 2023  compared to a $4 million tax expense in the same period in 2022. Fluctuations in the Brazilian real exchange rate impact the valuation of the Company’s net deferred tax positions related to our operations in Brazil.AMG paid taxes of $35 million in the second quarter of 2023  compared to tax payments of $9 million in the second quarter of 2022. The higher cash taxes in the current quarter were a result of tax payments tracking the consistent upward trend in Brazil results.Exceptional ItemsAMG’s second quarter 2023 gross profit includes exceptional items  which are not included in the calculation of EBITDA.A summary of exceptional items included in gross profit in the second quarters of 2023 and 2022 are below:Exceptional items included in gross profitQ2 ‘23 Q2 ‘22 Change Gross profit $127 534 $102 240 25% Inventory cost adjustment 3 678 — N/A Restructuring expense 626 41 1427% Silicon’s partial closure (1 011) — N/A Strategic project (reversal) expense (55) 833 N/A Gross profit excluding exceptional items 130 772 103 114 27%AMG Vanadium had a $3.7 million non-cash expense during the second quarter of 2023. This is a result of inventory cost adjustments associated with declining prices and inventory specification issues due to the acquisition and testing of global refinery waste which has been adjusted in EBITDA.SG&AAMG’s second quarter 2023 SG&A expenses were $49 million compared to $37 million in the second quarter of 2022  with the increase largely attributable to higher personnel costs driven by increased hiring in our Lithium  Engineering  and LIVA businesses. It was also driven by a one-time pension expense of $6.7 million due to the restructuring of executive employee benefit plans.LiquidityJune 30  2023 December 31  2022 Change Senior secured debt $338 505 $348 622 (3%) Cash & cash equivalents 391 251 346 043 13% Senior secured net (cash) debt (52 746) 2 579 N/A Other debt 14 987 14 959 —% Net (cash) debt excluding municipal bond (37 759) 17 538 N/A Municipal bond debt 319 124 319 244 —% Restricted cash 1 440 6 920 (79%) Net debt 279 925 329 862 (15%)AMG ended the second quarter in a $280 million net debt position. This decrease versus year-end 2022 was mainly due to higher cash balances from strong operating cash flow.AMG continued to maintain a strong balance sheet and adequate sources of liquidity during the second quarter. As of June 30  2023  the Company had $391 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and $195 million available on its revolving credit facility. As such  AMG had $586 million of total liquidity as of June 30  2023.Net Finance CostsAMG’s second quarter 2023 net finance cost was $7 million compared to $12 million in the second quarter of 2022. This variance was mainly driven by higher interest income earned  due to the overall increase in global interest rates  and an increase in cash and cash equivalents balances as well as foreign exchange losses in the prior period. Additionally  in today’s rising rate environment  AMG continues to benefit from its low-cost fixed-rate debt facilities. AMG has an average interest rate charge across its two main debt instruments of 5%.OutlookGiven the global economic uncertainty and the slowdown in China  current spot prices across AMG’s critical materials portfolio are significantly below the prices we experienced when we announced our initial guidance for 2023 in November 2022. The price of lithium carbonate in November 2022  the date of our $400 million EBITDA guidance  has now almost halved and our other relevant portfolio prices are down an average of 25%.Therefore  we have changed our full year EBITDA guidance for 2023 from “exceeding $400 million in EBITDA” to “a range between $350 million to $380 million in EBITDA.” An EBITDA in this range represents the highest EBITDA in the history of AMG.As previously disclosed  third quarter profitability will be negatively impacted by lower volumes associated with the spodumene expansion project. Volumes will recover in the fourth quarter as the project begins to ramp up.Regarding our long-term guidance  we are extremely pleased with the advancement of our strategic projects. We are moving forward with our lithium concentrate expansion in Brazil. We’ve signed a mandate letter to fund the chemical upgrader in Brazil  and our lithium hydroxide refinery in Bitterfeld  Germany  is under construction  with commissioning for the first 20 000-ton module expected in the fourth quarter of 2023.These transformational projects in lithium  our newly complete ferrovanadium spent catalyst recycling facility in Ohio  and the continued ramp-up in our AMG Critical Materials Technologies segment will drive increased volumes across our Clean Energy Materials segment and confirm our confidence in our long-term guidance. Our long-term guidance therefore remains unchanged at an EBITDA level of $650 million  or more  in 5 years  or earlier.Profit for the period to adjusted EBITDA reconciliationQ2 ‘23 Q2 ‘22 Profit for the period $43 573 $29 879 Income tax expense 26 552 23 156 Net finance cost 7 282 12 211 Equity-settled share-based payment transactions 1 495 1 372 Restructuring expense 626 41 Pension adjustment 6 700 — Silicon’s partial closure (362) — Inventory cost adjustment 3 678 — Strategic project expense (1) 3 476 3 107 Share of loss of associates 760 — Others — (3) EBIT 93 780 69 763 Depreciation and amortization 13 673 11 363 EBITDA 107 453 81 126Notes:(1) The Company is in the initial development and ramp-up phases for several strategic expansion projects  including AMG Vanadium’s expansion project  the joint venture with Shell  Hybrid Lithium Vanadium Redox Flow Battery System  and the lithium expansion in Germany  which incurred project expenses during the quarter but are not yet operational.

This milestone represents a strategic move in optimizing resources and improving energy efficiency.The project will contribute with approximately 50 MW of capacity to the power grid and will provide 2 hours of storage capacity. The asset will play a crucial role in grid management  offering flexibility and supporting the government's strategy for renewable energy in the UK.This first storage system developed by EDPR will be located in Kent  England  and has been acquired from Tupa Energy  a British company specializing in utility-scale battery storage  as well as other technologies (such as solar). This project is expected to become operational by the end of 2024.""The integration of storage systems will play a crucial role in the renewable energy mix of the future  as it will contribute to address the challenge of intermittency. By mitigating the impact of external factors that can affect availability  these systems are key in overcoming one of the main limitations faced by renewables across Europe  while producing no emissions""  said Miguel Stilwell d'Andrade  CEO of EDPR.EDPR places a high priority on energy storage as part of its long-term strategy. The company anticipates significant growth in this technology  particularly through various initiatives planned in the United Kingdom. The UK stands out as the most advanced market in Europe for the development of battery storage assets  leveraging a comprehensive regulatory framework. This includes a Capacity Market that provides a fixed floor with a 15-year tenor. Currently  the country already has 2.2 GW of battery projects connected to the grid  with an additional 2 GW under construction.EDP Renewables remains dedicated to advancing energy efficiency on a global scale. In its updated Business Plan for 2023-2026  the company aims to achieve a storage capacity of over 500 MW  primarily through co-located assets  with a smaller portion consisting of stand-alone assets such as the recently acquired project.

Other income in H1 2023 was £1.4 million (H1 2022: £0.9 million).Strong revenue and robust cash generationThe Group expects to report half year revenues of £27.3 million excluding other income (H1 2022: £18.0 million)  a 52% increase year-on-year. This growth has been driven through the delivery of a higher number of human challenge trials with continued increases in total contract value. In addition to the revenue generated  the Group also recognised other income relating to R&D tax credits of £1.4 million (H1 2022: £0.9 million). The improved EBITDA margin of c.19% is a result of enhanced operational efficiencies and concurrent execution of multiple larger trials. The Group continues to be strongly cash generative with a cash position of £31.3 million as at 30 June 2023 (H1 2022: £15.9 million) following the payment of a £3.0 million special dividend on 9 June 2023.Growing orderbookAs at 30 June 2023  the Group's weighted contracted orderbook increased to £78 million (H1 2022: £70 million)  an increase of 11%  underlining the continued growth in demand for human challenge trials from the global biopharma industry. Importantly  the orderbook is diversified across multiple clients  challenge agents and geographies  which provides a strong foundation for long term revenue growth.Full year outlookhVIVO is fully contracted to achieve its revenue guidance for 2023 and the Group has a record orderbook giving visibility of revenue into the second half of 2024  which will allow the management team to effectively optimise its resources  improve strategic decision making and enhance its adaptability and flexibility in managing its revenue pipeline. This coupled with its track record of excellent operational delivery provides a strong foundation for future trading.While there have been industry wide delays in UK clinical trial approvals by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority (MHRA)  the Board does not currently expect the MHRA delays to have a material impact on revenue. This delay in approvals has had some impact on new trials but the Company is successfully working closely with both its clients and the MHRA to ensure the timely delivery of studies and has implemented a contingency plan to mitigate any potential impact.",neutral,0.07,0.91,0.02,mixed,0.65,0.25,0.1,True,English,"['Trading Update', 'HVIVO', 'R&D tax credits', 'Healthcare products Regulatory Authority', 'UK clinical trial approvals', 'Strong first half performance', 'human challenge clinical trials', 'long term revenue growth', 'First half revenue growth', 'human challenge trials', 'respiratory disease products', 'total contract value', '£3.0 million special dividend', 'strategic decision making', 'half year revenues', 'long-term sustainable growth', 'Full year outlook', 'multiple larger trials', 'robust cash generation', 'full year guidance', 'global biopharma industry', 'Full year revenue', 'excellent operational delivery', 'second half', 'new trials', 'continued growth', 'Strong revenue', 'revenue guidance', 'operational efficiencies', 'strong foundation', 'Net cash', 'cash position', 'revenue pipeline', 'Trading Update', 'world leader', 'six-month period', 'other income', 'higher number', 'continued increases', 'concurrent execution', 'multiple clients', 'management team', 'future trading', 'wide delays', 'timely delivery', 'contingency plan', 'hVIVO plc', 'EBITDA margin', 'material impact', 'potential impact', 'revenue visibility', 'record orderbook', 'Growing orderbook', 'track record', 'The Group', 'MHRA delays', 'July', 'AIM', 'Euronext', 'HVO', 'testing', 'infectious', 'Highlights', '30 June', 'expectations', 'H1', 'addition', 'c.', 'result', 'payment', '9 June', 'demand', 'agents', 'geographies', 'resources', 'adaptability', 'flexibility', 'Medicines', 'Board', 'Company', 'studies']",2023-07-26,2023-07-27,marketscreener.com

This progression also reflects the firm's decision to reduce recruitment over 2023/24  due to a more uncertain business environment and the fall in staff turnover rate.At June 30  2023  staff turnover  on a rolling 12-month basis  stood at 15%  compared with 16% over the whole of the 2022/23 fiscal year.Recovery in the consultant utilization rate in Q1 at 73%; average sales prices up by +1%During Q1 2023/24  the firm began to progressively restore its consultant utilization rate  which had experienced a significant drop during the previous quarter. As anticipated  it stood at 73% over the period  compared with 71% in the previous quarter and 73% for the whole of the 2022/23 fiscal year.The average daily rate reached €896 over the quarter – an increase of +0.7% compared with the average sales price for the whole of the 2022/23 fiscal year (€890). At constant exchange rates  the average daily rate increased by +1.0%  to €899.The order book increased slightly to 4.2 months at the end of June 2023  compared with 4.0 months at March 31  2023.Start to the year that exceeded expectations; prudent approach maintained for the rest of the yearWavestone saw a buoyant start to the 2023/24 fiscal year – slightly ahead of its business plan. The period just ended reflects the recovery in the consultant utilization rate and a fall in staff turnover rate. Prices remain strongly positioned.The economic slowdown is marked by increased volatility and a wait-and-see attitude from decision makers on committing expenditure to consulting projects. The firm expects this trend to continue and remains vigilant for potential signs of a slowdown in demand  sector by sector. Against this backdrop  Wavestone is maintaining the intensity of its business development activity  while confirming a more cautious approach than last year in terms of recruitment.Confirmation of the 2023/24 annual objectivesAt the end of the first three months of the fiscal year  Wavestone confirms its financial objectives for the 2023/24 fiscal year: to achieve organic growth at least equal to that of the 2022/23 fiscal year (+7%)  despite an unfavorable working day impact (-1.6% over the whole of the fiscal year).By integrating the effect of the full-year consolidation of PEN Partnership and Coeus Consulting  Wavestone is targeting a revenue of over €580m  which represents total growth of +9% for an EBIT margin of about 15%.As announced at the end of May  it should be noted that profitability over H1 of the fiscal year will be penalized by an unfavorable working day impact of -2.4% compared with H1 of the previous fiscal year.These objectives are calculated on a constant forex basis and exclude new acquisitions.The firm is also pursuing its activity on external growth  giving priority to the UK and the US  but without ruling out tactical purchases in other geographies.Project to combine Wavestone and Q_PERIOR to create a European consulting championOn July 25  2023  Wavestone and Q_PERIOR  a consulting leader in the German-speaking market (Germany  Switzerland  Austria)  announced the signature of a Memorandum of Understanding to join forces and create a European champion in the consulting market.Present in 8 German cities and 11 countries worldwide  with a strong European presence (Germany  Switzerland  Austria and the UK)  as well as in North America  Q_PERIOR has 1 410 employees (as of March 31  2023).Since 2019  Wavestone and Q_PERIOR had established a partnership to develop commercial synergies by capitalizing on their complementarities (geographical  sectoral presence and expertise). Building on the success of this collaboration  the two firms now aim to build a new player  one of Europe's leading consultancies from day one  by combining the capabilities of over 5 500 employees. By March 31  2023[1]  the new group would represent combined annual revenue of €818.4m  with an EBIT margin of 12.4%.By 2025  the new group would target revenue  excluding new acquisitions  of around €1 billion for the 2024/25 financial year  and EBIT of at least €130 million  an increase of over 70%[2].In the longer term  the new group would aim to develop at an average annual growth rate of 15%  combining organic and external growth  and would target a normative EBIT margin of around 15%.For more information on this combination project and its terms and conditions  read the press release dated July 25  2023: Wavestone and Q_PERIOR intend to join forces to create a European consulting champion.Next events: Combined Ordinary and Extraordinary Annual General Meeting: Thursday  July 27  2023  at 9am; and H1 2023/24 revenue: Monday  October 30  2023  after Euronext market closing.About WavestoneIn a world where knowing how to drive transformation is the key to success  Wavestone's mission is to inform and guide large organizations in their most critical transformations  with the ambition of a positive outcome for all stakeholders.

However  there were still signs of a more subdued investment environment  with funds raised through ""further issues"" — additional share offerings to raise more cash — down 36% to £3.65 billion.The number of companies listing across the main and smaller alternative investment (AIM) markets in London fell to 17 from 29. The figures are dwarfed by the frenzy of activity in 2021  which saw 48 London listings in the first half and a total of £19.8 billion raised.Elsewhere  funds raised (the amount of cash companies earn when they list on an exchange) fell 86.9% on the Nasdaq Nordic  and dried up completely on the Euronext Amsterdam.Meanwhile  the Euronext Milan index and the German Deutsche Börse were both boosted by significant listings  the former by the 600 million euro ($664.2 million) initial public offering of Italian gambling firm Lottomatica in May — the biggest in Europe in the year so far.

Implementation of the share capital reduction decided by shareholders general meeting through decrease of Technicolor Creative Studios’ par value of the shares from €1 to €0.01.Caroline Parot  Chief Executive Officer of Technicolor Creative Studios  said: “The first half of 2023 saw the acceleration of our Company’s profound transformation. We have been streamlining our processes and improving our operational efficiency all with the aim of achieving ever-greater client satisfaction. Yet  industry wide issues are slowing our recovery journey and strikes in Hollywood challenge our pipeline of projects.In this context  I want to extend my heartfelt appreciation to our valued clients and partners. Their continued trust and support are instrumental in driving us forward. I am equally grateful for the dedication of our exceptional team. Their talent and passion are the driving force behind our transformation and the industry recognition we continue to receive.”Hugues de Nicolay  Chief Financial Officer of Technicolor Creative Studios  said: “Our transformation plan is progressing well. The set of measures taken including cost optimization  IT system integration partly offset the impact of revenue decline on the adjusted EBITDA after lease. Although our Company’s operational turnaround is already visible across our organization  our figures do not yet fully reflect the benefit of our recovery plan”.H 1 202 3 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTSRevenuesH1 2023 H1 2022 % Change % Change at constant currency in million € 122.8 213 -42% -40% MPC 81 56 +44.7% +47% Mikros Animation 91.7 132 -30.5% -30% The Mill 7.3 6 +21.5% +20% Technicolor Games 302.7 408.7 -25.9% -24.3% TotalTechnicolor Creative Studios revenues amounted to €302.7 million in the first half of 2023  down -25.9% at current rate (down -24.3% at constant rate) compared to the same period in 2022. This decrease mainly includes the reduction of the pipeline compared to H1 2022 (post covid recovery year).At MPC  first half 2023 revenues amounted to €122.8 million  down -42% at current rate compared to the same period last year (down -40% at constant rate). This underperformance reflects the expected lower activity compared to a high H1 2022.At Mikros Animation  first half 2023 revenues amounted to €81 million  up +44.7% at current rate  compared to the same period last year (up +47% at constant rate). This significant growth was driven by a low H1 2022 with major feature animation projects ramping up in H2/2022 for deliveries in H1/2023.At The Mill  first half 2023 advertising revenues amounted to €91.7 million  representing a -30.5% decrease at current rate (down -30% at constant rate) compared to the same period in 2022. Activity was restricted by an unfavorable macroeconomic environment with decelerating advertising spending  increased competition compared to H1 2022.At Technicolor Games  first half 2023 revenues amounted to €7.3 million  up +23.5% at current rate compared to the prior-year period (up +20% at constant rate). This growth is the result of an increased activity from existing and new clients such as Sega  Sumo  GamFreak and Netease.Adjusted EBITDA after leaseIn million € H1 2023 H1 2022 Var Revenue 302.7 408.7 -106 Adjusted EBITDA after lease -15.8 43.2 -58.9 In % of revenue -5% 11% n.a.In first half 2023  adjusted EBITDA after lease decreased by €58.9 million to €-15.8 million. The cost actions taken as part of the Re*Imagined program – and notably variable costs – partly offset the reduction of activity.In light of the current writers and actors strike in Hollywood that started early May 2023  the Company is dedicated to address the impact on its business activities and has already started to adapt its business plan and strategy consequently.Successful c ompletion of the RefinancingTechnicolor Creative Studios announced on June 9  2023  the successful completion of its refinancing including a new money financing for a total principal amount of approximately 170 million euros. A first refinancing tranche of 85 000 000 euros has been drawn at the beginning of April and a second refinancing tranche of 85 000 000 euros has been granted early June.Following the Refinancing  by a decision of the Board of Directors of July 25  2023  adopted pursuant to the twenty-eight resolution approved by the Combined General Meeting of May 15  2023  the par value of each of the Company’s shares has been decreased from one euro (€1) to one euro cent (€0.01) and the share capital is as a result reduced from twenty-five million five hundred and eleven thousand eight hundred and twenty-two euros (€25 511 822) to two hundred and fifty-five thousand one hundred and eighteen euros and twenty-two cents (€255 118.22).This technical share capital decrease  which was approved by the General Meeting on May 15  2023  will have no impact on the stock price of the Company’s shares  or on the number of shares in circulation. As a result of this share capital reduction  the Company’s share capital remains composed of twenty-five million five hundred and eleven thousand eight hundred and twenty-two (25 511 822) ordinary shares.Standalone cash and net debt at June 30  2023In millions of euros IFRS Debt Financial Debt3 (532) Operating Leases (139) Liquidity4 99FURTHER PROGRESS ON THE IMPLEM ENTATION OF THE RE*IMAGINED PROGRAMTechnicolor Creative Studios is making progress in advancing the Re*Imagined program with greater operational and governance controls  gains in operation process improvements  resource management and workforce planning which are in line with expectations.

SPS Commerce believes that this non-GAAP measure provides useful information to management  our board of directors  and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and results of operations. SPS Commerce's management uses this non-GAAP measure to compare the company's performance to that of prior periods for trend analyses and planning purposes. Adjusted EBITDA is also used for purposes of determining executive and senior management incentive compensation.Adjusted EBITDA consists of net income adjusted for income tax expense  depreciation and amortization expense  stock-based compensation expense  realized gain or loss from foreign currency on cash and investments held  investment income or loss  and other adjustments as necessary for a fair presentation. Net income is the comparable GAAP measure of financial performance.SPS Commerce uses Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of operating performance because it assists the company in comparing performance on a consistent basis  as it removes from operating results the impact of the company's capital structure. SPS Commerce believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful to an investor in evaluating the company's operating performance because it is widely used to measure a company's operating performance without regard to items such as depreciation and amortization  which can vary depending upon accounting methods and the book value of assets  and to present a meaningful measure of corporate performance exclusive of the company's capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired.This non-GAAP measure should not be considered a substitute for  or superior to  financial measures calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. This non-GAAP financial measure excludes significant expenses and income that are required by GAAP to be recorded in the company's financial statements and are subject to inherent limitations.Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains forward-looking statements  including information about management's view of SPS Commerce's future expectations  plans and prospects  including our views regarding future execution within our business  the opportunity we see in the retail supply chain world  and our and TIE Kinetix’s anticipated performance and results for the third quarter and full year of 2023 and full year 2024 and 2025  within the safe harbor provisions under The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

This non-GAAP financial measure excludes significant expenses and income that are required by GAAP to be recorded in the company's financial statements and are subject to inherent limitations.Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains forward-looking statements  including information about management's view of SPS Commerce's future expectations  plans and prospects  including our views regarding future execution within our business  the opportunity we see in the retail supply chain world  and our and TIE Kinetix’s anticipated performance and results for the third quarter and full year of 2023 and full year 2024 and 2025  within the safe harbor provisions under The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

The growth in order intake was also strong  up 17%  with €83 million signed this quarter. The high order backlog and the dynamism of the Group's markets provide good visibility for the second half of 2023  enabling to confirm the 2023 guidance. In this context  Exail Technologies has slightly increased its stake in its subsidiary Exail Holding.Exail Technologies now presents its revenues into two complementary and vertically integrated business segments:The Navigation & Maritime Robotics segment includes the group's two main activities  vertically integrated: the sale of navigation systems  positioning systems  and sonars; and the commercialization of drones and autonomous drone systems for maritime applications  integrating the group's navigation systems and other equipment in order to offer the most effective robotic solutions.This segment accounts for approximately 75% of the Group's revenues and 90% of its backlog.The Advanced Technologies segment consists of developing and selling the highest-performance photonic and quantum components (specialty optical fibers  optical modulators  quantum measurement instruments) and products using the most advanced technologies (on-board communication equipment  simulators  autonomous decision-making). These components and products are sold directly to third parties or integrated into the systems of the Navigation & Maritime Robotics segment.This segment represents approximately 25% of the group's revenues and 10% of its backlog.Revenues by business segment 2023 and 2022 proforma[1](in € million) Q2 2023 Q2 2022proforma Var. %2023vs 2022proforma H1 2023 H1 2022proforma Var. %2023vs 2022proforma Consolidated revenues 85 4 71 5 +19% 153 6 134 9 +14% Navigation & Maritime Robotics 65 7 54 8 +20% 116 5 104 7 +11% The Advanced Technologies 22 4 17 6 +27% 41 3 32 2 +28% Structure & intra-group eliminations -2 7 -0 9 - -4 1 -2 0 - Backlog at the end of the period 614 n.a - 614 n.a -Navigation & Maritime Robotics: notable advances in both civil and defense applicationsThe activity in the Navigation & Maritime Robotics segment intensified in the second quarter 2023  generating +20% in revenues. This increase was driven by three major growth vectors:Good progress on major ongoing defense programs   notably the underwater mine countermeasures programs for the Belgian and Dutch navies and for the Latvian navy. The second quarter saw major advances in the development of obstacle-avoidance sonar  with successful sea trials.  notably the underwater mine countermeasures programs for the Belgian and Dutch navies and for the Latvian navy.

Among the strong trends of the quarter  deliveries of inertial navigation systems of the Phins Compact range (compact INS for underwater drones) more than doubled in volume. The breakthrough in growing applications thanks to differentiating solutions  for land defense (for which deliveries rose by over 50% this quarter)  space navigation  or drones for underwater mapping. The DriX achieved two new successes this quarter  consolidating the Group's position in this new application of surface drones for oceanography.Advanced technologies: strong demand translates into record deliveriesThe ramp-up in production rates for this segment continues and enabled to meet the numerous orders to be delivered in the quarter  both for internal needs and for third-party customers. Revenues in this segment thus rose by +27%. The highly diversified customer base includes many leading players in the laser  telecoms  aeronautics  space  defense and quantum industries  who rely on Exail as a strategic and recurring supplier.Among the key trends of the quarter  deliveries of optical modulators for laser-based optical communications rose by more than 50%  as did deliveries of optical fibers and micro-optical benches for Lidars[2]. Equipment for the civil and defense aeronautics sector also made a significant contribution to revenue growth. The segment's strong structural momentum was thus confirmed in this first half of the year.€83 million in new orders in the second quarterA few months after the start of its integration  the sales network combining the forces of ex-ECA and ex-iXblue is demonstrating its ability to reach a greater number of customers with the new Exail Group's entire portfolio of products and solutions. Order intake totaled €83 million  up +17% on the proforma second quarter 2022.The backlog thus stands at €614 million at the end of June 2023  providing very good visibility for the second half of 2023. The second part of the year should thus see a high volume of deliveries for products and equipment  and significant progress in the revenues for major programs.Capital of EXAIL HOLDING opening to group managers and employees alongside Exail TechnologiesThe Group has given some fifty Exail managers the opportunity to invest in the capital of Exail Holding  the subsidiary of Exail Technologies specially dedicated to the combination between ECA and iXblue. This capital opening  launched in June  will enable management to be associated with the company's performance over the long term  under preferential conditions  particularly in the event of value growth of over 100% for Exail Technologies over a 4 to 5-year horizon. The subscription period will end at the end of the summer  and dozens of managers are expected to take part in the operation.Exail's four main general managers (former general managers of ECA Group and iXblue) had already subscribed to the capital in the fourth quarter 2022  for around €2 million  under the same conditions.More broadly  Exail Holding is in the process of setting up a Fonds Commun de Placement d'Entreprise (FCPE) to offer all group employees the possibility of investing part of their savings and compensation in equity.Overall  the investment of the Group's employees and managers in the capital of Exail Holding should represent a several million euros  resulting in very low dilution for Exail Technologies  and confirming the commitment and confidence of the teams in achieving the company's ambitions by associating them in the value creation.Exail Technologies increases its stake in Exail HoldingBuoyed by a market context favorable to Exail's products  the Group also seized an opportunity to strengthen its stake in Exail Holding  with a 5% stake  by buying out the minority shareholding of Mr. Arditty  iXblue's former main shareholder. Mr Arditty wished to sell his stake for personal reasons. The price conditions  governed by previous shareholder agreements  enable Exail Technologies to invest €24.5 million on the basis of the same enterprise value as that negotiated at the beginning of 2022. As a result  Exail Technologies' stake in Exail Holding has risen from 62% to 67%.This investment was financed by the Group's available cash  which benefited from a cash inflow of €30 million at the beginning of 2023 thanks to the sale of the Engineering & Protection Systems division.Exail Technologies has thus made a good start to 2023  buoyed by growth in its civil and defense markets. The Group confirms its revenue growth target for 2023 of more than 15% compared with proforma 2022 revenues.About Exail TechnologiesExail Technologies is the new name of Groupe Gorgé  adopted after the transformation of the group at the end of 2022  now focused on the activities of its subsidiary Exail.

Business activity declined 24% over the period to €4.5m. After ten consecutive half-years of growth since the IPO  this decrease reflects a voluntary shift of the Sports business model from a sales-based to a Technology as a Service-based (TaaS) model. This transition is based on multi-year contracts incorporating hardware  software and services  and generating strong recurring revenue as well as increased customer loyalty. This shift happens in the context of a still solid sales momentum  with orders up sharply since the beginning of the year and business set to improve from the second half onwards.

The first half of the year was marked by the transition of the Sports business model  with an increase in orders based on a recurring model. In the Sports market (83% of H1 revenue)  revenue dipped 19% to €3.7m from €4.6m in H1 2022. The trend needs to be considered in the light of the increasing contribution of orders signed as part of recurring contracts  with commitment periods of three to five years. While the implementation of this new TaaS model (encouraged by a substantial share of new customers) has an impact on sales in the short term  it offers three key advantages for VOGO: An increasing contribution from recurring revenue  without any impact on business profitabilityAn increase in the contribution of orders placed directly with principals.Strengthened customer loyalty with significant potential to extend the sales of audio and video technology solutions to existing customers. Business in the first half of the year was also influenced by the certification of professional audio and video refereeing solutions in football  granted at the end of June  for a period of four years. This achievement paves the way for new contracts with sports federations and reinforces VOGO's central role in the sports world as VAR provider. Waiting for this certification in the first half of the year generated delays in the execution of several orders. VOGO will catch up on this shortfall in the second half of the year  bolstering business activity in the coming months. In the Industrial market (17% of revenue in H1)  sales trends were mixed  reflecting the generally subdued economic climate  which led to a wait-and-see attitude on the part of customers with regards to investment decisions. Net income totalled €0.8m compared to €1.3m in H1 2022. However  an improvement is expected in the second half of the year  through a strengthened sales team and the growing awareness of the industrial world of the importance of audio solutions in ensuring safety  protection and comfort of employees. This last topic is becoming a key element in the CSR strategies of industrial companies. Geographical breakdown of revenue reflects the business model transformation under way Trend in revenue by geographical region In €m H1 2023 H1 2022 Chg. % non-audited data Total revenue 4.5 5.9 -24% Of which France 1.2 1.5 -22% Of which Export 3.3 4.3 -24% revenuePress release Montpellier  26 July 2023 As far as sales areas are concerned  the trends at play also reflect the ongoing transformation of the business model and the delays in orders recorded in the first half of the year. International business continues to account for a significant share of overall business  representing over 73% of revenue. The EMEA region (87% of total business) was down 18% compared to the same period in 2022  with revenue of €3.9m. The US region (10% of revenue in H1)  which is particularly sensitive to the TaaS model  posted revenue of €0.5 million  compared to €0.9 million in H1 2022. But the outlook remains favourable in all regions  underpinned by the quality of the order book and ongoing discussions on numerous projects now in their latter stages. Order intake of €8.9m in the first half of 2023  up 46% vs. the first half of 2022. Business activity expected to improve in the second half of the year VOGO is starting the second half of the financial year with confidence. Orders booked in the first half of 2023 totalled €8.9m  up 46% vs. the first half of 2022 (€6.1m) and up 68% vs. the average of 2022. This momentum will drive business from the second half of the year onwards. As far as international markets are concerned  new contracts on professional audio and video solutions are also in sight with around ten federations and leagues  with  once again  a contribution expected to start on the second half of the year. Alongside football  other sports such as rugby and handball will also benefit from the momentum. In addition  VOGO recently announced the launch of a new range of audio communication solutions in the refereeing market. This expansion of the range will act as an additional growth driver in the coming months. Given these favourable factors  the Group is already expecting a significant increase in revenue in the second half of the year compared to the first half of the year. VOGO also remains ideally positioned to take advantage of the opportunities offered by major upcoming international sports events.

The average EUR/BRL rate was 5.48 in the first half of 2023  compared with 5.55 in the first half of 2022.In the first half of 2023  production reached 1.8 TWh  compared with 1.3 TWh in the first half of 2022  up +41%  reflecting the improvement in wind resources in Brazil and France (+4 points increase in the wind load factor in both countries) and  mainly  the increase in installed capacity in operation to 1 699 MW (+39%) at the end of June 2023. Energy sales benefited notably from Helexia's growth over the half-year.Q2 2023 turnover from Energy Sales reached €75.2 million  up +41% (+44% at constant exchange rates) compared with Q2 2022. Quarterly production was 0.9 TWh  up 40% from 0.6 TWh in 2022.By country :In Brazil  production is up by +40% due to better wind conditions than a year earlier and the full production of SSM1 and 2 (320 MW)  the company's largest solar power plant  commissioned in 2022;In France  production is up by +38% due to better wind conditions and production from plants commissioned in 2022 and 2023 (Helexia  Sable blanc  Sud Vannier) ;In other countries  Voltalia's production grew overall  multiplied by x8 in the United Kingdom with the new South Farm solar power plant  multiplied by x2 in Portugal with the start of production at the Garrido complex  and by +68% in Spain  marked by the strong growth in Helexia's production over the period. In Egypt and Jordania  production was down -4% year-on-year  due to a load factor that was slightly lower.SERVICESTurnover for the first half of 2023 from Services (internal and external) totalled €258.1 million  up +73% (+74% at constant exchange rates) compared with the first half of 2022. The Development  Construction and Equipment Procurement segment grew by +79% to €239.6 million  and the Operation & Maintenance segment by +23% to €18.5 million. Activity was temporarily concentrated on the internal services  with internal turnover (eliminated on consolidation) increasing multiplied by x4 to 197.2 million euros  and turnover with third-party customers falling by -40% to 60.9 million euros.Q2 2023 turnover from Services (internal and external) totalled €156.2 million  up +85% (+88% at constant exchange rates) compared with Q2 2022. Activity was temporarily focused on the internal market  with internal turnover (eliminated on consolidation) multiplied by x4  and turnover with third-party customers falling by -50% (-47 % at constant exchange rates). Analysis by segment shows strong growth in the Development  Construction and Equipment Procurement segment :The Development  Construction and Equipment Procurement segment posted turnover of €146.6 million  up +91%  thanks to a fourfold increase in internal activity  reflecting the record capacity under construction for its own account  which stands at 961 MW at the end of June 2023. External turnover for this segment on behalf of third-party customers fell by -58% to €19.4 million. Although more than 550 MW are currently under construction for third-party customers  few milestones have yet been reached during the period  with Voltalia recognising construction turnover based on the progress of projects.The Operation & Maintenance segment recorded turnover of €9.6 million  up by +17% (+19% at constant exchange rates)  driven in particular by third-party customers.Turnover eliminations for H1 2023 and Q2 2023 came to respectively €197.2 million (x4 at current and constant exchange rates) and €131.3 million (x4 at current and constant exchange rates)  reflecting the sharp increase in internal services for power plants under construction  the vast majority of which are due to be commissioned before the end of 2023  and during the operating period.RECENT DEVELOPMENTS (SELECTED)Update on Canudos project (99.4MW): confirmation of the validity of the construction permits by Brazilian federal courtVoltalia announces today that the Brazilian federal court of appeals overturned the preliminary decision that had suspended the Canudos project’s permits last april5 . Voltalia has the authorization to finalize the works  carry out the commissioning and start the operation of the wind farms. In parallel with the resumption of operations  Voltalia will present a complementary environmental study and arrange a public hearing with local communities within 6 months. The Public Prosecutor will have the possibility to make an appeal to this second instance decision within a limited time period (30 business day after being intimated of this decision).First megawatt-hours for the SSM3-6 solar power plant in Brazil6SSM3-6 is part of the Serra Branca cluster  the largest wind and solar cluster in the world  developed entirely by Voltalia. The cluster generates some of the most competitive energy in the country  with exceptional levels of wind and sunshine as complementary energy sources. Out of a total of 260 MW  17 MW came on stream in June and a further 83 MW since the beginning of July. The rest will gradually be brought on stream over the coming months. The plant is backed by a 14-year electricity sales contract with Copel  a Brazilian utility and long-standing partner of Voltalia.In French Guiana  commissioning of a combined solar and storage power plant7Voltalia has commissioned its Sable Blanc power plant  combining photovoltaic generation  with a capacity of 5 MW  and battery storage  with a capacity of 10.6 MWh. Developed entirely by Voltalia  the mixed power plant will benefit from a guaranteed sales tariff for 20 years. The lithium-ion batteries will enable the electricity produced during the day to be injected after night fall  while improving the stability of electricity production in a region with high demand.SNCF Energie signs a new wind energy supply contract with Voltalia8The contract covers production at a wind farm in the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region of France. The contract is for a period of 25 years. The wind farm  called Rives Charentaises  has a total installed capacity of 37.4 MW  and will produce around 78 GWh a year  or 1.4% of SNCF Voyageurs' traction electricity consumption. The plant is scheduled to be commissioned in the first half of 2024.Helexia wins a new 90 MW contract in Brazil9The 20-year agreement between Helexia and Comerc Energia  a leading provider of energy management solutions in Brazil  covers the supply of up to 90 MW of photovoltaic solar power spread across a series of distributed generation projects.

The Group uses alternative performance indicators (not defined under IFRS)  described in detail in Appendix 1 on page 6 of this document: In millions of euros H1 2023 H1 2022 Change in % Revenue 1 608.3 1 564.0 +2.8% Of which organic change +3.4% +13.8% Adjusted EBITDA 126.1 126.2 +0.0% % of revenue 7.8% 8.1% Adjusted EBIT 59.2 55.3 +7.1% % of revenue 3.7% 3.5% EBIT 48.5 44.2 +9.7% % of revenue 3.0% 2.8% Net profit attributable to shareholders of the company 2.8 12.6 ‐ Fully diluted earnings per share (€) 0.04 0.19 Free cash flow 27.3 ‐260.3 ‐ Net debt 648.9 778.0 ‐ Leverage (Net debt to adjusted EBITDA over 12 months) 2.8x 3.2x Net revenue in H1 2023 was €1 608 million  up by 2.8% compared to the first half of 2022. Organic growth reached 3.9%. The total effect of the selling price increases implemented in 2022 across all segments is +5.5% on average in 2023 compared to H1 2022. Over the period  volume fell by ‐2.1%. The strong Sport activity largely offsets the volume shrinkage in flooring  which is particularly pronounced in EMEA against a backdrop of weakness 1in the Residential segment. The currency effect contributed negatively  notably due to the depreciation of the Russan ruble  the Norwegian krone and the pound sterling in EMEA and the dollar. Adjusted EBITDA amounted to €126.1 million  i.e.  7.8% of revenue  compared to €126.2 million in H1 2022  i.e.  8.1% of revenue. The decrease in volumes sold contributed negatively to EBITDA. The combined effect of volume and product mix is ‐€45 million owing to the decrease in flooring  including more profitable products in the Commercial segment. Raw material  energy and transport prices started to fall in the second quarter  with a positive net effect on the half‐ year of +€8 million compared to 2022  but wage inflation remains significant (‐€16 million). Selling price increases rolled out throughout the 2022 financial year led to a positive effect of +€85 million in H1 2023 compared to H1 2022 and is now starting to offset the additional costs linked to inflation of raw materials recorded since the second half of 2021. SG&A are slightly up (€10 million) to support the growth of Sport and the launch of new flooring collections. Foreign exchange had a negative ‐€15 million impact compared to the first half of 2022 due to the depreciation of the ruble and the weakening of the dollar. The adjusted EBITDA margin for the first half of the year showed a slight decline (7.8% of sales compared to 8.1% in the first half of 2022). EBIT amounted to €48.5 million in H1 2023 up from €44.2 million in 2022. EBIT adjustments (detailed in Appendix amounted to €10.7 million in H1 2023 compared to €11.1 million in H1 2022. These include restructuring costs related to the Commercial  General and Administrative Expenses Savings Plan and the streamlining of the industrial organisation in Asia. Financial expenses amounted to €33.9 million in H1 2023  compared to €14.4 million in H1 2022. This increase is mainly due to the rise in average gross debt over the half‐year compared to H1 2022. The rise in interest rates is largely neutralised by hedging instruments implemented in 2021. The income tax expense amounted to €11.4 million in 2023  down compared to the previous year (€16.4 million) given the decrease in profit before tax. Net profit in H1 2023 is €2.8 million  i.e.  a diluted earnings per share of €0.04. 21. H1 Revenue and EBITDA by segment Revenue by segment Of which organic Of which growth In millions of euros H1 2023 H1 2022 Change organic Organic growth growth(incl.

Significant price increases were implemented in 2021 and 2022 to offset the effects of inflation in purchasing costs  therefore the Group also measures the change in like‐for‐like sales including price adjustments in the CIS countries. Adjusted EBITDA by segment In millions of euros H1 2023 H1 2022 Margin Margin 2023 2022 EMEA 37.0 54.2 8.4% 11.1% North America 41.4 31.1 9.0% 6.9% CIS  APAC & Latin America 36.6 40.5 13.2% 13.9% Sports 42.6 28.4 9.9% 8.5% Central ‐31.6 ‐28.1 ‐ ‐ TOTAL 126.1 126.2 7.8% 8.1% Comments by segment The EMEA segment achieved a revenue of €443 million  down ‐9.0% compared to H1 2022. Volumes are down in the residential segment  where demand has slowed sharply due to the rise in interest rates and inflation which have slowed down the renovation and new construction market. The commercial segment is holding up better: our vinyl products for the healthcare and education and carpets for the office or hospitality experienced volumes of business close to 2022. The segment's adjusted EBITDA amounts to €37 million  i.e. 8.4% of sales  versus €54 million/11.1% of sales in H1 2022. This decline mainly reflects lower volumes  higher salary increases than in previous years  and a negative effect of exchange rates on European currencies against the euro. The effect of raw material purchase prices is still negative over the entire six‐month period compared to the previous year  but it is fully offset by selling price increases. The North America segment reported revenue of €458 million  up +1.6% compared to H1 2022  reflecting solid like‐ for‐like growth of +0.7% at constant exchange rates and scope due to the selling price increase. The commercial segments (offices  healthcare and education) held up well and their volume of business was similar to last year over the six‐month period. They benefited from a sequential improvement in accessories  carpet tiles and vinyl during 3the second quarter. The volume in residential remains very low against a backdrop marked by inflation and the rise in interest rates  which weighed on the renovation and construction of housing. Adjusted EBITDA in the segment increased significantly to €41 million  i.e. 9% of sales  compared to €31 million/6.9% of sales in the first half of 2022  reflecting a favourable product mix effect  and a positive balance of inflation buoyed by the price increases deployed in 2022 and the start of the downturn in material costs compared to last year. Sales in the CIS  APAC and Latin America segment amounted to €278 million  down ‐4.5% given the devaluation of the ruble against the euro. Sales at constant exchange rates and scope were slightly up +0.7%. They benefited from the improvement compared to the first half‐year 2022 in volumes in Russia (+14%) and Ukraine (+89%) while the Group carried out a selective price drop to maintain the level of activity in a context that remains complex. In Asia  demand was quite low over the first half‐year and the level of stock among distributors remains high. Selling price increases implemented in 2022 partially compensate for the lack of volume. The economic context also weighed on volumes in Latin America  but to a lesser extent. Adjusted EBITDA for the CIS  APAC  Latin America segment fell to €37 million adjusted EBITDA  i.e.  13.2% of sales  versus €41 million/13.9% of sales in H1 2022  mainly due to the devaluation of the ruble. In the first half of the year  Russia accounted for less than 8% of Group sales and Ukraine less than 0.6%. Revenue of Sport reached a new record and amounted to €429 million  a considerable increase of +28.1% compared to H1 2022. The level of activity remains particularly buoyant in a still dynamic market  particularly for artificial turf sports fields and athletics tracks in North America. Like‐for‐like growth at constant exchange rates and scope is +26.9%. As a result of this very sustained activity  Sport posts a clear increase in adjusted EBITDA: €43 million /9.9% of sales compared to €28.4 million/8.5% of sales in the first half of 2022. This EBITDA growth results from the combination of the volume effect and an improvement in the margins of the main projects. 2. Balance Sheet and Cashflow 2023 At the end of June 2023  working capital requirements fell by €10 million compared to the end of December 2022  despite strong seasonality  particularly in Sport. The Group implemented significant actions to reduce inventories  which now represent 70 days of activity compared to 110 days at the end of June 2022. In addition  annual negotiations with key suppliers have improved payment terms. Combined with the downside effect of purchase prices  these actions have led to a very significant reduction in working capital requirements: ‐€206 million compared to June 2022. Factoring programs represented a net financing of €182.6 million at the end of June 2023  up from the end of December 2022 (€174.2 million) and the end of June 2022 (€184.0 million).

Combining Worldline leading technology and products with the distribution power of Crédit Agricole  we have the joint ambition to create the future leading player in the French market able to deliver premier services to all merchants. The preparatory work post-announcement is progressing well  fully in line with a targeted signing in the course of Q3 2023 and a closing before the end of the year.Last  end of March  we have completed the acquisition of Banco Desio Merchant Acquiring activities reinforcing our local presence in the Italian market with a strong partner.Based on this good first-half showing its enhanced competitive strengths 2 years after the start of the ex-Ingenico integration the Group confirms its 2023 objectives and reaffirms its strategic projects to establish Worldline as a premium global Paytech while actively participating in the Payment industry consolidation.""* H1 2022 at constant scope and exchange rates** Normalized net income Group share on continued operations*** H1 2022 conversion rate calculated on H1 2022 statutory OMDA from continued operationsWorldline's H1 2023 revenue reached €2 242 million  representing +9.3% revenue organic growth (of which +9.4% in Q2). This achievement was reached thanks  in particular  to the continuous growth dynamic in Merchant Services reflecting the robustness of the business model. It reflects the benefit of the widespread and rapid shift towards digital payments as well as the Group's strong positioning following the acquisition of Ingenico.This strong execution also materialized in the Group's Operating Margin before Depreciation and Amortization (OMDA) reaching € 519 million in H1 2023; representing 23.1% of revenue  an improvement by +80 basis points compared to H1 2022 at constant scope and exchange rates. This profitability improvement was led in particular by Merchant Services posting +100 basis points thanks to the acceleration of revenue growth fostering operating leverage; synergies from Ingenico; and effects of transversal productivity actions.Net income Group share from continued operations reached € 81 million  an improvement of +5.6%. Normalized net income Group share from continued operations (excluding unusual and infrequent items  Group share  net of tax) reached € 243 million  up +14.3%.Normalized basic EPS was € 0.86 in H1 2023 compared to €0.76 in H1 2022.

This achievement was notably reached thanks to the solid growth in Merchant Services at +13.5% organically  fueled by payment volumes both instore and online in commercial acquiring activities. Financial Services was broadly stable  in line with anticipated full year trajectory. Mobility & e-Transactional Services benefited of a solid underlying growth but remained impacted  as already disclosed  by the re-insourcing of a secured mail telco operator contract end of Q2 22  leading to an overall flat performance in Q2 2023.Merchant Services' revenue in Q2 2023 reached € 849 million  representing a solid organic growth by +13.5%. Acquiring MSV reached € 120 billion in Q2  a solid performance led in particular by the strong Online acquiring MSV growth and new merchants gained.By division  the dynamics were the following:Commercial Acquiring: Strong double-digit growthdriven by the good performance for almost all geographies especially in Switzerland  Benelux and Germany and fueled as well by the good start of new activities integrated in Italy and Greece.Payment Acceptance: Good double-digit growth mainly led by Digital Commerce benefitting from the good ramp-up of new customers recently signed and the continuous recovery of travel related verticals  while omnichannel solutions continue to gain traction in the vast majority of our geographies.Digital Services: Soft performance despite a good level of activity in Turkey and Benelux related to retailers' activities.During the second quarter of the year  commercial activity in Merchant Services materialized in numerous wins or extensions for both Commercial Acquiring and Payment Acceptance  in-store and online  with among others  Blizzard  Valve  Evonity  Amazing Talker  and new key partnerships signed with Vtex (Digital commerce platform) and travelplanbooker.com.Q2 2023 revenue reached € 236 million up +0.2% organically  with a soft growth in the second quarter as expected.The performance by division was the following:Card-based payment processing activities (Issuing Processing and Acquiring Processing): Significant improvement driven by APAC  thanks to new project deliveries  as well as continuous good development of volumes in Benelux and France.Account Payments: Soft performance despite a good level of activity with large German contracts (Commerzbank and Unicredit)Digital Banking: Good Dynamic fueled by increased volumes and new contracts in France  Belgium and Switzerland  offsetting a soft performance in the NetherlandsIn Q2 2023  Financial services activity was also marked by the successful delivery of a front end prototype in collaboration with ECB to shape the future digital euro. Worldline delivered the person-to-person (P2P) fully offline payment use-case  allowing individuals to make payments using the digital euro  even when no party involved has network access. The prototype's success confirms the technological feasibility and industrial scaling potential of the offline scenario  contributing to a more resilient payment system.Revenue in Mobility & e-Transactional Services reached € 87 million  stable organically with a good underlying growth still offset by the effect of the re-insourcing of the secured mail telco operator contract end of H1 22  as already disclosed.The performance by division was the following:Trusted Digitization: Soft performance despite a good dynamic in France driven new projects signed and volumes growth from energy subsidies.e-Ticketing: Double-digit growth driven by increased volumes in transportation and a strong momentum in the UK with the ramp-up of contracts signed such as WECA.Finally  e-Consumer & Mobility: Organic decline despite a solid growth in Iberia and the contribution of the new contract signed with SNCF (the French railway national organization) not able to offset the re-insourcing of a French telco operator contract.Commercial activity in Mobility & e-Transactional Services was dynamic during the quarter  in particular with the signature of a contract with Paris- Ile-de-France regional authority to realize and to operate the new generation of its digital services platform for highschoolers. This service will be use by 1.5 million highschoolers and will be the center piece of the digital education policy for Paris region. This major win opens new growth perspectives for the Trusted Services business line.OMDA OMDA % In € million H12023 H12022 * Organic change H12023 H12022 * Organic change Merchant Services 399 339 +17.6% 24.8% 23.9% +100 bps Financial Services 127 129 -1.3% 27.4% 28.1% -70 bps Mobility & e-Transactional Services 22 22 +3.7% 13.1% 12.6% +50 bps Corporate -30 -32 -7.2% -1.3% -1.6% +30 bps Worldline 519 457 +13.4% 23.1% 22.3% +80 bps* at constant scope and exchange ratesMerchant Services' OMDA in H1 2023 amounted to € 399 million  24.8% of revenue  representing a strong improvement by +100 basis points.

Leveraging Worldline's vertical expertise and Crédit Agricole's strong distribution networks and deep French market presence  the contemplated partnership would offer a state-of-the-art combination of technological and commercial offerings at scale allowing to adequately respond to any type of evolving merchant needs. The joint-company would be majority owned (50% of total capital plus one share) and fully consolidated by Worldline and would be in charge of leveraging Worldline's global processing power and of developing all the innovative products dedicated to the French market. The joint-company would also be in charge of the commercial development of the alliance  both directly for largest merchants in particular  and indirectly by providing an active support to the bank distribution channels. In order to implement the partnership  targeting a joint-company that will start to generate revenue and OMDA early 2025  important milestones have been reached as per plan. Worldline work councils' consultation has been finalized with a positive advice obtained and the antitrust filling is in progress. Based on these developments  we are on-tracks for signing expected in Q3 2023 and a closing of the transaction in Q4 2023.Last  we have completed the acquisition of Banco Desio Merchant Acquiring activities on March 28  2023  reinforcing Worldline presence in the promising Italian market with a strong partner. Since the closing of the acquisition  we have started the migration of the c. 15 thousand merchants on Worldline platform. The process of migration is expected to be fully completed by end Q3 2023.During this first Semester  Worldline is well on track regarding the achievements of its CSR Transformation programme. As far as the environment is concerned  the objectives have even been exceeded. These excellent results demonstrate the perfect alignment between the programme and the Group's CSR expectations.

Organic growth reached 3.9%. The total effect of the selling price increases implemented in 2022 across all segments is +5.5% on average in 2023 compared to H1 2022. Over the period  volume fell by -2.1%. The strong Sport activity largely offsets the volume shrinkage in flooring  which is particularly pronounced in EMEA against a backdrop of weakness in the Residential segment. The currency effect contributed negatively  notably due to the depreciation of the Russan ruble  the Norwegian krone and the pound sterling in EMEA and the dollar.Adjusted EBITDA amounted to €126.1 million  i.e.  7.8% of revenue  compared to €126.2 million in H1 2022  i.e.  8.1% of revenue.The decrease in volumes sold contributed negatively to EBITDA. The combined effect of volume and product mix is -€45 million owing to the decrease in flooring  including more profitable products in the Commercial segment.Raw material  energy and transport prices started to fall in the second quarter  with a positive net effect on the half-year of +€8 million compared to 2022  but wage inflation remains significant (-€16 million).Selling price increases rolled out throughout the 2022 financial year led to a positive effect of +€85 million in H1 2023 compared to H1 2022 and is now starting to offset the additional costs linked to inflation of raw materials recorded since the second half of 2021.SG&A are slightly up (€10 million) to support the growth of Sport and the launch of new flooring collections.Foreign exchange had a negative -€15 million impact compared to the first half of 2022 due to the depreciation of the ruble and the weakening of the dollar.The adjusted EBITDA margin for the first half of the year showed a slight decline (7.8% of sales compared to 8.1% in the first half of 2022).EBIT amounted to €48.5 million in H1 2023 up from €44.2 million in 2022. EBIT adjustments (detailed in Appendix 1) amounted to €10.7 million in H1 2023 compared to €11.1 million in H1 2022. These include restructuring costs related to the Commercial  General and Administrative Expenses Savings Plan and the streamlining of the industrial organisation in Asia.Financial expenses amounted to €33.9 million in H1 2023  compared to €14.4 million in H1 2022. This increase is mainly due to the rise in average gross debt over the half-year compared to H1 2022. The rise in interest rates is largely neutralised by hedging instruments implemented in 2021. The income tax expense amounted to €11.4 million in 2023  down compared to the previous year (€16.4 million) given the decrease in profit before tax.Net profit in H1 2023 is €2.8 million  i.e.  a diluted earnings per share of €0.04.H1 Revenue and EBITDA by segmentRevenue by segmentIn millions of euros H1 2023 H1 2022 Change Of which organic growth Of which organic growthOrganic growth(incl.

Significant price increases were implemented in 2021 and 2022 to offset the effects of inflation in purchasing costs  therefore the Group also measures the change in like-for-like sales including price adjustments in the CIS countries.Adjusted EBITDA by segmentIn millions of euros H1 2023 H1 2022 Margin2023 Margin2022 EMEA 37.0 54.2 8.4% 11.1% North America 41.4 31.1 9.0% 6.9% CIS  APAC & Latin America 36.6 40.5 13.2% 13.9% Sports 42.6 28.4 9.9% 8.5% Central -31.6 -28.1 - - TOTAL 126.1 126.2 7.8% 8.1%Comments by segmentThe EMEA segment achieved a revenue of €443 million  down -9.0% compared to H1 2022. Volumes are down in the residential segment  where demand has slowed sharply due to the rise in interest rates and inflation which have slowed down the renovation and new construction market. The commercial segment is holding up better: our vinyl products for the healthcare and education and carpets for the office or hospitality experienced volumes of business close to 2022.The segment’s adjusted EBITDA amounts to €37 million  i.e. 8.4% of sales  versus €54 million/11.1% of sales in H1 2022. This decline mainly reflects lower volumes  higher salary increases than in previous years  and a negative effect of exchange rates on European currencies against the euro. The effect of raw material purchase prices is still negative over the entire six-month period compared to the previous year  but it is fully offset by selling price increases.The North America segment reported revenue of €458 million  up +1.6% compared to H1 2022  reflecting solid like-for-like growth of +0.7% at constant exchange rates and scope due to the selling price increase. The commercial segments (offices  healthcare and education) held up well and their volume of business was similar to last year over the six-month period. They benefited from a sequential improvement in accessories  carpet tiles and vinyl during the second quarter. The volume in residential remains very low against a backdrop marked by inflation and the rise in interest rates  which weighed on the renovation and construction of housing.Adjusted EBITDA in the segment increased significantly to €41 million  i.e. 9% of sales  compared to €31 million/6.9% of sales in the first half of 2022  reflecting a favourable product mix effect  and a positive balance of inflation buoyed by the price increases deployed in 2022 and the start of the downturn in material costs compared to last year.Sales in the CIS  APAC and Latin America segment amounted to €278 million  down -4.5% given the devaluation of the ruble against the euro. Sales at constant exchange rates and scope were slightly up +0.7%. They benefited from the improvement compared to the first half-year 2022 in volumes in Russia (+14%) and Ukraine (+89%) while the Group carried out a selective price drop to maintain the level of activity in a context that remains complex. In Asia  demand was quite low over the first half-year and the level of stock among distributors remains high. Selling price increases implemented in 2022 partially compensate for the lack of volume. The economic context also weighed on volumes in Latin America  but to a lesser extent.Adjusted EBITDA for the CIS  APAC  Latin America segment fell to €37 million adjusted EBITDA  i.e.  13.2% of sales  versus €41 million/13.9% of sales in H1 2022  mainly due to the devaluation of the ruble. In the first half of the year  Russia accounted for less than 8% of Group sales and Ukraine less than 0.6%.Revenue of Sport reached a new record and amounted to €429 million  a considerable increase of +28.1% compared to H1 2022. The level of activity remains particularly buoyant in a still dynamic market  particularly for artificial turf sports fields and athletics tracks in North America. Like-for-like growth at constant exchange rates and scope is +26.9%.As a result of this very sustained activity  Sport posts a clear increase in adjusted EBITDA:€43 million /9.9% of sales compared to €28.4 million/8.5% of sales in the first half of 2022. This EBITDA growth results from the combination of the volume effect and an improvement in the margins of the main projects.Balance Sheet and Cashflow 2023At the end of June 2023  working capital requirements fell by €10 million compared to the end of December 2022  despite strong seasonality  particularly in Sport. The Group implemented significant actions to reduce inventories  which now represent 70 days of activity compared to 110 days at the end of June 2022. In addition  annual negotiations with key suppliers have improved payment terms. Combined with the downside effect of purchase prices  these actions have led to a very significant reduction in working capital requirements: -€206 million compared to June 2022. Factoring programs represented a net financing of €182.6 million at the end of June 2023  up from the end of December 2022 (€174.2 million) and the end of June 2022 (€184.0 million).Capital expenditures are under control and amount to €40.4 million given the capacity investment in Sport for yarn manufacturing and automation projects. In H1 2022  investments amounted to €46.4 million.Despite the seasonality of its activities and thanks to inventory control  the Group generates a positive free cash flow in the first half-year of €27.3 million  while the first half-year is usually cash-consuming.Net financial debt amounts to €649 million at the end of June 2023  versus €655 million at the end of December 2022 and €778 million at the end of June 2022. Compared to December 2022  debt is slightly down  and leverage remains the same at 2.8x the adjusted EBITDA for the last 12 months.At the end of June 2023  the Group had a high level of liquidity amounting to €552 million comprising the undrawn RCF in an amount of €251 million  other confirmed and unconfirmed credit lines in an amount of €78 million and €223 million in cash.OutlookThe macroeconomic environment will continue to weigh on the level of demand for our flooring products in the second half of the year  particularly in Europe. North America could benefit from a more favourable economic dynamic  with some activity indicators in the building sector now better oriented  especially in the residential sector.Activity in Sport is still benefiting from a buoyant market and a solid order book that should allow for continued dynamic growth until the end of the 2023 season.The purchase prices of most of the Group’s raw materials have decreased in the first half of the year and the Group does not anticipate any further increases for the time being. Wage inflation is higher than in previous years  and energy prices in Europe could rise again at the end of the year. At this stage  the Group maintains the selling price level reached at the end of 2022.To compensate the low level of activity in Europe  the Group launched cost reduction actions and adapted its production plans in the factories to these downturned levels of activity.Tarkett will continue to pay particular attention in the second half of the year to the control working capital and inventory levels in this weak business environment to maximise its cash generation and reduce its debt at the end of December.This press release may contain forward-looking statements.

Combining Worldline leading technology and products with the distribution power of Crédit Agricole  we have the joint ambition to create the future leading player in the French market able to deliver premier services to all merchants. The preparatory work post-announcement is progressing well  fully in line with a targeted signing in the course of Q3 2023 and a closing before the end of the year.Last  end of March  we have completed the acquisition of Banco Desio Merchant Acquiring activities reinforcing our local presence in the Italian market with a strong partner.Based on this good first-half showing its enhanced competitive strengths 2 years after the start of the ex-Ingenico integration the Group confirms its 2023 objectives and reaffirms its strategic projects to establish Worldline as a premium global Paytech while actively participating in the Payment industry consolidation.”H1 2023 key figuresIn € million H1 2023 H1 2022 change Revenue* 2 242 2 051 +9.3% OMDA* 519 457 +13.4% % of revenue 23.1% 22.3% +80 bps Net income Group share from continued operations** 81 53 +51.6% % of statutory revenue from continued operations 3.6% 2.6% Normalized net income Group share from continued operations** 243 213 +14.3% % of statutory revenue from continued operations 10.8% 10.5% Free cash flow (FCF) from continued operations 232 230 +0.8% OMDA to FCF conversion rate*** 44.7% 49.0% Closing net debt (before IFRS 5)* 1 837 3 456 * H1 2022 at constant scope and exchange rates ** Normalized net income Group share on continued operations *** H1 2022 conversion rate calculated on H1 2022 statutory OMDA from continued operationsWorldline’s H1 2023 revenue reached € 2 242 million  representing +9.3% revenue organic growth (of which +9.4% in Q2). This achievement was reached thanks  in particular  to the continuous growth dynamic in Merchant Services reflecting the robustness of the business model. It reflects the benefit of the widespread and rapid shift towards digital payments as well as the Group’s strong positioning following the acquisition of Ingenico.This strong execution also materialized in the Group’s Operating Margin before Depreciation and Amortization (OMDA) reaching € 519 million in H1 2023; representing 23.1% of revenue  an improvement by +80 basis points compared to H1 2022 at constant scope and exchange rates. This profitability improvement was led in particular by Merchant Services posting +100 basis points thanks to the acceleration of revenue growth fostering operating leverage; synergies from Ingenico; and effects of transversal productivity actions.Net income Group share from continued operations reached € 81 million  an improvement of +5.6%. Normalized net income Group share from continued operations (excluding unusual and infrequent items  Group share  net of tax) reached € 243 million  up +14.3%.Normalized basic EPS was € 0.86 in H1 2023 compared to € 0.76 in H1 2022.

This achievement was notably reached thanks to the solid growth in Merchant Services at +13.5% organically  fueled by payment volumes both instore and online in commercial acquiring activities. Financial Services was broadly stable  in line with anticipated full year trajectory. Mobility & e-Transactional Services benefited of a solid underlying growth but remained impacted  as already disclosed  by the re-insourcing of a secured mail telco operator contract end of Q2 22  leading to an overall flat performance in Q2 2023.Merchant ServicesMerchant Services’ revenue in Q2 2023 reached € 849 million  representing a solid organic growth by +13.5%. Acquiring MSV reached € 120 billion in Q2  a solid performance led in particular by the strong Online acquiring MSV growth and new merchants gained.By division  the dynamics were the following:Commercial Acquiring: Strong double-digit growth driven by the good performance for almost all geographies especially in Switzerland  Benelux and Germany and fueled as well by the good start of new activities integrated in Italy and Greece.Payment Acceptance: Good double-digit growth mainly led by Digital Commerce benefitting from the good ramp-up of new customers recently signed and the continuous recovery of travel related verticals  while omnichannel solutions continue to gain traction in the vast majority of our geographies. Digital Services: Soft performance despite a good level of activity in Turkey and Benelux related to retailers’ activities.During the second quarter of the year  commercial activity in Merchant Services materialized in numerous wins or extensions for both Commercial Acquiring and Payment Acceptance  in-store and online  with among others  Blizzard  Valve  Evonity  Amazing Talker  and new key partnerships signed with Vtex (Digital commerce platform) and travelplanbooker.com.Financial ServicesQ2 2023 revenue reached € 236 million up +0.2% organically  with a soft growth in the second quarter as expected.The performance by division was the following:Card-based payment processing activities (Issuing Processing and Acquiring Processing): Significant improvement driven by APAC  thanks to new project deliveries  as well as continuous good development of volumes in Benelux and France.Account Payments: Soft performance despite a good level of activity with large German contracts (Commerzbank and Unicredit)Digital Banking: Good Dynamic fueled by increased volumes and new contracts in France  Belgium and Switzerland  offsetting a soft performance in the NetherlandsIn Q2 2023  Financial services activity was also marked by the successful delivery of a front end prototype in collaboration with ECB to shape the future digital euro. Worldline delivered the person-to-person (P2P) fully offline payment use-case  allowing individuals to make payments using the digital euro  even when no party involved has network access. The prototype’s success confirms the technological feasibility and industrial scaling potential of the offline scenario  contributing to a more resilient payment system.Mobility & e-Transactional ServicesRevenue in Mobility & e-Transactional Services reached € 87 million  stable organically with a good underlying growth still offset by the effect of the re-insourcing of the secured mail telco operator contract end of H1 22  as already disclosed.The performance by division was the following:Trusted Digitization: Soft performance despite a good dynamic in France driven new projects signed and volumes growth from energy subsidies.e-Ticketing: Double-digit growth driven by increased volumes in transportation and a strong momentum in the UK with the ramp-up of contracts signed such as WECA. Finally  e-Consumer & Mobility: Organic decline despite a solid growth in Iberia and the contribution of the new contract signed with SNCF (the French railway national organization) not able to offset the re-insourcing of a French telco operator contract.Commercial activity in Mobility & e-Transactional Services was dynamic during the quarter  in particular with the signature of a contract with Paris- Ile-de-France regional authority to realize and to operate the new generation of its digital services platform for highschoolers. This service will be use by 1.5 million highschoolers and will be the center piece of the digital education policy for Paris region.

Combining Worldline leading technology and products with the distribution power of Crédit Agricole  we have the joint ambition to create the futureleading player in the French market able to deliver premier services to all merchants.The preparatory work post-announcement is progressing well  fully in line with a targeted signing in the course of Q3 2023 and a closing before the end of the year.Last  end of March  we have completed the acquisition of Banco Desio Merchant Acquiring activities reinforcing our local presence in the Italian market with a strong partner.Based on this goodfirst-half showing its enhanced competitive strengths 2 years after the start of the ex-Ingenico integrationthe Group confirms its 2023 objectives and reaffirms its strategic projects to establish Worldline as a premium global Paytechwhile actively participating in the Payment industry consolidation.”H1 2023 key figuresIn € million H1 2023 H1 2022 change Revenue* 2 242 2 051 +9.3% OMDA* 519 457 +13.4% % of revenue 23.1% 22.3% +80 bps Net income Group share from continued operations** 81 53 +51.6% % of statutory revenue from continued operations 3.6% 2.6% Normalized net income Group share from continued operations** 243 213 +14.3% % of statutory revenue from continued operations 10.8% 10.5% Free cash flow (FCF) from continued operations 232 230 +0.8% OMDA to FCF conversion rate*** 44.7% 49.0% Closing net debt (before IFRS 5)* 1 837 3 456 * H1 2022 at constant scope and exchange rates ** Normalized net income Group share on continued operations *** H1 2022 conversion rate calculated on H1 2022 statutory OMDA from continued operationsWorldline’s H1 2023 revenue reached €2 242 million  representing +9.3% revenue organic growth (of which +9.4% in Q2). This achievement was reached thanks  in particular  to the continuous growth dynamic in Merchant Services reflecting the robustness of the business model. It reflects the benefit of the widespread and rapid shift towards digital payments as well as the Group’s strong positioning following the acquisition of Ingenico.This strong execution also materialized in the Group’s Operating Margin before Depreciation and Amortization (OMDA) reaching € 519 million in H1 2023; representing 23.1% of revenue  an improvement by +80 basis points compared to H1 2022 at constant scope and exchange rates. This profitability improvement was led in particular by Merchant Services posting +100 basis points thanks to the acceleration of revenue growth fostering operating leverage; synergies from Ingenico; and effects of transversal productivity actions.Net income Group share from continued operations reached € 81 million  an improvement of +5.6%. Normalized net income Group share from continued operations (excluding unusual and infrequent items  Group share  net of tax) reached € 243 million  up +14.3%.Normalized basic EPS was € 0.86 in H1 2023 compared to €0.76 in H1 2022.

This achievement was notably reached thanks to the solid growth in Merchant Services at +13.5% organically  fueled by payment volumes both instore and online in commercial acquiring activities. Financial Services was broadly stable  in line with anticipated full year trajectory. Mobility & e-Transactional Services benefited of a solid underlying growth but remained impacted  as already disclosed  by the re-insourcing of a secured mail telco operator contract end of Q2 22  leading to an overall flat performance in Q2 2023.Merchant ServicesMerchant Services’ revenue in Q2 2023 reached € 849 million  representing a solid organic growth by +13.5%. Acquiring MSV reached € 120 billion in Q2  a solid performance led in particular by the strong Online acquiring MSV growth and new merchants gained.By division  the dynamics were the following:Commercial Acquiring: Strong double-digit growth driven by the good performance for almost all geographies especially in Switzerland  Benelux and Germany and fueled as well by the good start of new activities integrated in Italy and Greece.Payment Acceptance: Good double-digit growth mainly led by Digital Commerce benefitting from the good ramp-up of new customers recently signed and the continuous recovery of travel related verticals  while omnichannel solutions continue to gain traction in the vast majority of our geographies. Digital Services: Soft performance despite a good level of activity in Turkey and Benelux related to retailers’ activities.During the second quarter of the year  commercial activity in Merchant Services materialized in numerous wins or extensions for both Commercial Acquiring and Payment Acceptance  in-store and online  with among others  Blizzard  Valve  Evonity  Amazing Talker  and new key partnerships signed with Vtex (Digital commerce platform) and travelplanbooker.com.Financial ServicesQ2 2023 revenue reached € 236 million up +0.2% organically  with a soft growth in the second quarter as expected.The performance by division was the following:Card-based payment processing activities (Issuing Processing and Acquiring Processing): Significant improvement driven by APAC  thanks to new project deliveries  as well as continuous good development of volumes in Benelux and France.Account Payments: Soft performance despite a good level of activity with large German contracts (Commerzbank and Unicredit)Digital Banking: Good Dynamic fueled by increased volumes and new contracts in France  Belgium and Switzerland  offsetting a soft performance in the NetherlandsIn Q2 2023  Financial services activity was also marked by the successful delivery of a front end prototype in collaboration with ECB to shape the future digital euro. Worldline delivered the person-to-person (P2P) fully offline payment use-case  allowing individuals to make payments using the digital euro  even when no party involved has network access. The prototype’s success confirms the technological feasibility and industrial scaling potential of the offline scenario  contributing to a more resilient payment system.Mobility & e-Transactional ServicesRevenue in Mobility & e-Transactional Services reached € 87 million  stable organically with a good underlying growth still offset by the effect of the re-insourcing of the secured mail telco operator contract end of H1 22  as already disclosed.The performance by division was the following:Trusted Digitization: Soft performance despite a good dynamic in France driven new projects signed and volumes growth from energy subsidies.e-Ticketing: Double-digit growth driven by increased volumes in transportation and a strong momentum in the UK with the ramp-up of contracts signed such as WECA. Finally  e-Consumer & Mobility: Organic decline despite a solid growth in Iberia and the contribution of the new contract signed with SNCF (the French railway national organization) not able to offset the re-insourcing of a French telco operator contract.Commercial activity in Mobility & e-Transactional Services was dynamic during the quarter  in particular with the signature of a contract with Paris- Ile-de-France regional authority to realize and to operate the new generation of its digital services platform for highschoolers. This service will be use by 1.5 million highschoolers and will be the center piece of the digital education policy for Paris region.

Organic growth reached 3.9%. The total effect of the selling price increases implemented in 2022 across all segments is +5.5% on average in 2023 compared to H1 2022. Over the period  volume fell by -2.1%. The strong Sport activity largely offsets the volume shrinkage in flooring  which is particularly pronounced in EMEA against a backdrop of weakness in the Residential segment. The currency effect contributed negatively  notably due to the depreciation of the Russan ruble  the Norwegian krone and the pound sterling in EMEA and the dollar.Adjusted EBITDA amounted to €126.1 million  i.e.  7.8% of revenue  compared to €126.2 million in H1 2022  i.e.  8.1% of revenue.The decrease in volumes sold contributed negatively to EBITDA. The combined effect of volume and product mix is -€45 million owing to the decrease in flooring  including more profitable products in the Commercial segment.Raw material  energy and transport prices started to fall in the second quarter  with a positive net effect on the half-year of +€8 million compared to 2022  but wage inflation remains significant (-€16 million).Selling price increases rolled out throughout the 2022 financial year led to a positive effect of +€85 million in H1 2023 compared to H1 2022 and is now starting to offset the additional costs linked to inflation of raw materials recorded since the second half of 2021.SG&A are slightly up (€10 million) to support the growth of Sport and the launch of new flooring collections.Foreign exchange had a negative -€15 million impact compared to the first half of 2022 due to the depreciation of the ruble and the weakening of the dollar.The adjusted EBITDA margin for the first half of the year showed a slight decline (7.8% of sales compared to 8.1% in the first half of 2022).EBIT amounted to €48.5 million in H1 2023 up from €44.2 million in 2022. EBIT adjustments (detailed in Appendix 1) amounted to €10.7 million in H1 2023 compared to €11.1 million in H1 2022. These include restructuring costs related to the Commercial  General and Administrative Expenses Savings Plan and the streamlining of the industrial organisation in Asia.Financial expenses amounted to €33.9 million in H1 2023  compared to €14.4 million in H1 2022. This increase is mainly due to the rise in average gross debt over the half-year compared to H1 2022. The rise in interest rates is largely neutralised by hedging instruments implemented in 2021. The income tax expense amounted to €11.4 million in 2023  down compared to the previous year (€16.4 million) given the decrease in profit before tax.Net profit in H1 2023 is €2.8 million  i.e.  a diluted earnings per share of €0.04.H1 Revenue and EBITDA by segmentRevenue by segmentIn millions of euros H1 2023 H1 2022 Change Of which organic growth Of which organic growthOrganic growth(incl.

Significant price increases were implemented in 2021 and 2022 to offset the effects of inflation in purchasing costs  therefore the Group also measures the change in like-for-like sales including price adjustments in the CIS countries.Adjusted EBITDA by segmentIn millions of euros H1 2023 H1 2022 Margin2023 Margin2022 EMEA 37.0 54.2 8.4% 11.1% North America 41.4 31.1 9.0% 6.9% CIS  APAC & Latin America 36.6 40.5 13.2% 13.9% Sports 42.6 28.4 9.9% 8.5% Central -31.6 -28.1 - - TOTAL 126.1 126.2 7.8% 8.1%Comments by segmentThe EMEA segment achieved a revenue of €443 million  down -9.0% compared to H1 2022. Volumes are down in the residential segment  where demand has slowed sharply due to the rise in interest rates and inflation which have slowed down the renovation and new construction market. The commercial segment is holding up better: our vinyl products for the healthcare and education and carpets for the office or hospitality experienced volumes of business close to 2022.The segment’s adjusted EBITDA amounts to €37 million  i.e. 8.4% of sales  versus €54 million/11.1% of sales in H1 2022. This decline mainly reflects lower volumes  higher salary increases than in previous years  and a negative effect of exchange rates on European currencies against the euro. The effect of raw material purchase prices is still negative over the entire six-month period compared to the previous year  but it is fully offset by selling price increases.The North America segment reported revenue of €458 million  up +1.6% compared to H1 2022  reflecting solid like-for-like growth of +0.7% at constant exchange rates and scope due to the selling price increase. The commercial segments (offices  healthcare and education) held up well and their volume of business was similar to last year over the six-month period. They benefited from a sequential improvement in accessories  carpet tiles and vinyl during the second quarter. The volume in residential remains very low against a backdrop marked by inflation and the rise in interest rates  which weighed on the renovation and construction of housing.Adjusted EBITDA in the segment increased significantly to €41 million  i.e. 9% of sales  compared to €31 million/6.9% of sales in the first half of 2022  reflecting a favourable product mix effect  and a positive balance of inflation buoyed by the price increases deployed in 2022 and the start of the downturn in material costs compared to last year.Sales in the CIS  APAC and Latin America segment amounted to €278 million  down -4.5% given the devaluation of the ruble against the euro. Sales at constant exchange rates and scope were slightly up +0.7%. They benefited from the improvement compared to the first half-year 2022 in volumes in Russia (+14%) and Ukraine (+89%) while the Group carried out a selective price drop to maintain the level of activity in a context that remains complex. In Asia  demand was quite low over the first half-year and the level of stock among distributors remains high. Selling price increases implemented in 2022 partially compensate for the lack of volume. The economic context also weighed on volumes in Latin America  but to a lesser extent.Adjusted EBITDA for the CIS  APAC  Latin America segment fell to €37 million adjusted EBITDA  i.e.  13.2% of sales  versus €41 million/13.9% of sales in H1 2022  mainly due to the devaluation of the ruble. In the first half of the year  Russia accounted for less than 8% of Group sales and Ukraine less than 0.6%.Revenue of Sport reached a new record and amounted to €429 million  a considerable increase of +28.1% compared to H1 2022. The level of activity remains particularly buoyant in a still dynamic market  particularly for artificial turf sports fields and athletics tracks in North America. Like-for-like growth at constant exchange rates and scope is +26.9%.As a result of this very sustained activity  Sport posts a clear increase in adjusted EBITDA:€43 million /9.9% of sales compared to €28.4 million/8.5% of sales in the first half of 2022. This EBITDA growth results from the combination of the volume effect and an improvement in the margins of the main projects.Balance Sheet and Cashflow 2023At the end of June 2023  working capital requirements fell by €10 million compared to the end of December 2022  despite strong seasonality  particularly in Sport. The Group implemented significant actions to reduce inventories  which now represent 70 days of activity compared to 110 days at the end of June 2022. In addition  annual negotiations with key suppliers have improved payment terms. Combined with the downside effect of purchase prices  these actions have led to a very significant reduction in working capital requirements: -€206 million compared to June 2022. Factoring programs represented a net financing of €182.6 million at the end of June 2023  up from the end of December 2022 (€174.2 million) and the end of June 2022 (€184.0 million).Capital expenditures are under control and amount to €40.4 million given the capacity investment in Sport for yarn manufacturing and automation projects. In H1 2022  investments amounted to €46.4 million.Despite the seasonality of its activities and thanks to inventory control  the Group generates a positive free cash flow in the first half-year of €27.3 million  while the first half-year is usually cash-consuming.Net financial debt amounts to €649 million at the end of June 2023  versus €655 million at the end of December 2022 and €778 million at the end of June 2022. Compared to December 2022  debt is slightly down  and leverage remains the same at 2.8x the adjusted EBITDA for the last 12 months.At the end of June 2023  the Group had a high level of liquidity amounting to €552 million comprising the undrawn RCF in an amount of €251 million  other confirmed and unconfirmed credit lines in an amount of €78 million and €223 million in cash.OutlookThe macroeconomic environment will continue to weigh on the level of demand for our flooring products in the second half of the year  particularly in Europe. North America could benefit from a more favourable economic dynamic  with some activity indicators in the building sector now better oriented  especially in the residential sector.Activity in Sport is still benefiting from a buoyant market and a solid order book that should allow for continued dynamic growth until the end of the 2023 season.The purchase prices of most of the Group’s raw materials have decreased in the first half of the year and the Group does not anticipate any further increases for the time being. Wage inflation is higher than in previous years  and energy prices in Europe could rise again at the end of the year. At this stage  the Group maintains the selling price level reached at the end of 2022.To compensate the low level of activity in Europe  the Group launched cost reduction actions and adapted its production plans in the factories to these downturned levels of activity.Tarkett will continue to pay particular attention in the second half of the year to the control working capital and inventory levels in this weak business environment to maximise its cash generation and reduce its debt at the end of December.This press release may contain forward-looking statements.

The Group's commercial performance benefited from record sales over the second quarter from The Bradery  whose success with millennials cannot longer be questioned  as well as the strength of our new growth levers such as International segments and the Marketplace. Alongside our commercial performance  we are also pleased with the efforts made to rationalize the cost structure  which will contribute to the improvement of the profitability. Faced with a demanding environment  we have demonstrated our ability to generate growth and profitability whilst absorbing economic shocks. All of these concrete gains strengthen the Group's fundamentals and illustrate the good implementation of our ACE roadmap.”François de Castelnau  Group Deputy CEO and Chief Financial Officer  added: “We have made significant progress over the period with improvement in our gross margin  continued control of costs  and an active and agile management of our inventories and investments. Our EBITDA has reached satisfactory levels  marking an improvement relative to the second half of 2022  despite the non-recurring costs inherent in the introduction of rationalization measures. In this climate  where visibility is still lacking  we will maintain rigorous control of expenditures and investments in order to deliver a strong  profitable and cash-generating growth in accordance with our ACE roadmap.”Strong business levels in an uncertain market climate  illustrating the resilience of the business modelDetails of revenue(€ million) H1 2022 H1 2023 Change23-22(%) Internet Revenue France 245.9 262.8 +6.9% International 55.4 61.7 +11.3% Total Internet Revenue 301.3 324.4 +7.7% Other revenue 4.1 6.9 +66.5% Net Revenue 305.4 331.3 +8.5%Consolidated financial statements have been subject to a limited.Growth of 8.5% to €331.3 million in the first half of 2023 driven by good commercial performances in the first quarter and by the success of the flagship private sales site for millennials  The Bradery  which saw record levels of sales in the second quarter. On a constant scope basis  excluding The Bradery  growth stood at 2.4%. Sales over the second quarter continued in the same trend than that of the first quarter albeit with a more normalized comparison basis and a stabilization of macroeconomic factors.The Fashion segment increased its revenue over the period  driven particularly by sportswear brands  whilst the Home & Deco segment decreased due to a normalization of the activity following the sustained momentum in the context of lockdown and post-Covid economic climate.The Travel & Leisure segment is growing at a healthy rate  with sales up 18% despite a slow-down due to economic conditions and rising transport prices.The Marketplace stood out over the period with a GMV increasing by nearly 58%  benefiting from a more stringent brand selection policy designed to improve quality and customer satisfaction.Beauté privée benefited over the period from the new positioning led by the launch of the Beauté privée community  Le Club  which already has nearly 14 000 members  and the launch of live shopping. Capitalising on these successes  the site stabilized sales in the second quarter  consolidating the future potential from its new value proposition  which should enable a return to profitable growth.SRP Services confirmed the Group's success in providing 360° support to brands and maintained stable revenue over the first half  despite the considerable impact of pricing pressures and a reduction in marketing budgets at brands. From the second half onwards  SRP Media is set to benefit from its partnership with Unlimitail  a joint venture between Publicis and Carrefour  through notably the cutting-edge automated adserver Citrus Ad  enabling it to build value for its 500 partner brands. These promising prospects will help support growth at SRP Media in the second half. Lastly  SRP Studios has continued to make gains  with growth of nearly 50% in the first half of 2023.International revenue continued to grow  with an increase of 11.3% to €61.7 million  despite limited marketing investment. International revenue accounted for 19% of the total.First positive effects of the new commercial strategyThe Group has continued its premiumization strategy to capitalize on the quality of its portfolio of renowned brands by offering affordable prices  which are particularly sought-after in a context of reduced purchasing power. With this in mind  the Group has continued to rationalize its numbers of sales and to withdraw from less profitable brands.The Group has maintained a high level of firm purchases and of dropshipping  which ensures shorter delivery times. These two delivery modes represented 37% and 32% respectively  from 27% and 32% respectively in H1 2022. Conditional sales accounted for 31%  thus maintaining the balance between the three distribution channels.Revenue from other businesses (notably “wholesale” physical destocking of unsold items and internet returns) was €6.9 million.Key performance indicators illustrating the resilience of the model and the positive effect of the commercial strategyH1 2022 H1 2023 Change 22-23% Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) 431.9 497.7 15.2% Cumulative buyers* (millions) 11.6 12.3 +6.2% Buyers** (millions ) 1.9 1.9 0.5% of which loyal buyers*** 1.6 1.6 -1.1% As % of total number of buyers 84% 83% +136bp Number of orders (millions ) 5.4 5.3 -1.7% Sales by buyer (IFRS) 145.9 148.1 1.6% Average number of orders per buyer 2.8 2.8 -2.2% Average basket 51.8 53.8 3.8%NB: Excludes The Bradery and Beauté Privée* All buyers who have made at least one purchase on the Group's platform since its launch** Member placing at least one order during the year*** Member placing at least one order during the year and at least one order in prior yearsGMV reached €497.7 million in the first half of 2023  some €66 million higher than in the same period of the previous year.The acquisition of new members and their conversion into new buyers continued during the first half of 2023  with a 6.2% increase in cumulative buyers  taking the number to 12.3 million.

This increase in the average basket size (+3.8%) offset the slight decrease in the number of orders (-1.7%)  resulting in an increase in revenue per buyer of 1.6%.The Group set new records for customer satisfaction levels over the period with a delivered NPS of 58% (3 points higher than 2022  and 4 points higher than H1 2022).Profitability trajectory in line with the Group's ambitions: EBITDA improvement relative to H2 2022Simplified income statement presentation to EBITDA level(€ million) H1 2022 H1 2023 Change22 – 23 (%) Net Revenue 305.4 331.3 8.5% Cost of sales -186.0 -203.4 9.4% Gross margin 119.5 127.9 +7.1% As % of revenue 39.1% 38.6% -50 bps Marketing* -10.6 -10.6 +0.4% as % of revenue 3.5% 3.2% -29 bps Logistics & fulfillment -73.9 -78.3 +6.0% as % of revenue 24.2% 23.6% -56 bps General & administrative expenses -31.6 -37.8 19.7% as % of revenue 10.4% 11.4% +107 bps Total current operating expenses 116.2 126.7 +9.1% as % of revenue 38.0% 38.2% +22 bps Current operating profit 3.3 1.2 -64.3% EBITDA 11.2 9.3 o/w France 11.1 10.7 o/w International 0.1 -1.4H1 2023 gross margin increased by €8.4 million to €127.9 million. This represented a margin of 38.6% of revenue  compared to 39.1% in the first half of 2022 and 35.6% in the second half of 2022. This reflects Showroomprivé's ability to improve its profitability by preserving its negotiating power and controlling its cost structure within a highly volatile economic environment and effects of inflation on costs.The current operating expenses stood at 38.2% of revenue  compared to 38.0% in the first half of 2022  reflecting the success of the policy of strict cost control and despite the increase in payroll costs due to inflation. The tight cost control over the past two half-year periods can be summarized as follows:Decrease in marketing expenditures to 3.2% of revenue as a result of the rationalization policy and a different seasonal pattern in marketing investment this year. The launch of a global ad campaign was has been postponed to the H2 2023;the rationalization policy and a different seasonal pattern in marketing investment this year. The launch of a global ad campaign was has been postponed to the H2 2023; Logistics expenditure increased by 6.0% compared to H1 2022  as a result of higher sales levels  but this represented 23.6% of revenue  compared to 24.2% in the same period of last year . This development was linked to the integration of The Bradery  which is developing mainly in Dropshipping  and the beginnings of the rationalization of the logistics network;. This development was linked to the integration of The Bradery  which is developing mainly in Dropshipping  and the beginnings of the rationalization of the logistics network; General and administrative costs increased to 11.4% of revenue  from 10.4% in the first half of 2022 due to investment in the implementation of the ACE roadmap  the fruits of which should be reaped over the next few semesters.Taking all these elements into account  EBITDA was €9.3 million  compared to €11.2 million in the first half of 2022 and €8.3 million in the second half of 2022. The last two semesters have confirmed the resilience of the Group's business model and have set the first milestones of the profitability trajectory ambitions.In 2015 and 2016 Showroomprivé  in line with other e-commerce players  was subject to a sector inquiry by the DGCCRF (Direction générale de la concurrence  de la consommation et de la répression des fraudes) regarding its pricing policy. This inquiry concerned old facts  covering a period from 2014 to 2016. Both parties was willing to settle the matter and thus signed an agreement resulting in a transactional fine of €600 000  as announced by the DGCCRF on July 11  2023. For many years now  the Group has strengthened its internal control and price checking procedures  with a dedicated team  in order to ensure that its members are provided with fair and accurate information on the reductions displayed. This transactional fine was covered by provisions made over previous years.Simplified presentation of the income statement  current operating profit and net result(€ million) H1 2022 H1 2023 ChangeH1 22- H1 23 (%) Current operating profit 3.3 1.2 -64.3% Other operating income and expense -0.4 -4.1 n.m.

Showroomprivé will continue to accelerate the expansion of the new growth levers  notably the International segment and the Marketplace.The measures undertaken since last year will continue to bear fruit. SRP Media will benefit from the dynamic nature of its new partnership with the Unlimitail joint venture. The optimization of the logistics network will allow a better amortization of the fixed costs  and the strict policies on negotiations and cost control measures will enable a lasting improvement in the profitability.Although visibility remains limited  over the second half Showroomprivé will accelerate the implementation of its ACE roadmap which aims to produce profitable and sustainable growth by following its three main strategic pillars (Adapt  Consolidate & Expand). Over the course of the second half  concrete actions will be taken on each of the pillars:dapt the value proposition to the latest market expectations while optimizing key assetsDraw on our expertise and our negotiating power to access inventories of brands that are currently under insolvency proceduresLaunch of a new targeted advertising campaign to boost the reputation of the brand and re-engage our member base with a more ROI-focused approachOptimization of our digital marketing to generate better qualified traffic and produce greater personalization to animate our base of active membersonsolidate and strengthen all the operational efficiency levers to unlock higher profitabilityContinued rationalization of logistics centersIncreasing negotiating power whilst preserving the value offered to our customers and our partnersMaintaining strict control over operating costsxtend and diversify our development model by capitalizing on attractive growth levers able to unlock the full potential of the growing penetration of e-commerceDeployment of the Unlimitail offering which will drive revenue growth at SRP MediaAccelerate the growth of the International segment with targeted marketing investmentsEnriching the Marketplace offering to build further on its successFuture publications3rd quarter revenue 2023  October 19  2023FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSThis press release contains only summary information and is not intended to be comprehensive.This press release may contain forward-looking information and statements about the Group and its subsidiaries.

The Group completed the acquisition of Reka Cables in Finland in the first-half of the year  for an equity price of 54 million euros. With operations in four countries  Reka Cables achieved sales of 172 million euros and EBITDA of 11 million euros in 2022. The Group expects to generate approximately 7 million euros annual synergies after ramp-up. Additionally  the integration of Centelsa in South America is progressing seamlessly  exceeding expectation on performance and synergies deployment one year ahead of plan.Nexans' transformation platform continues to achieve outstanding financial results and is operating at full speed for all units within the Electrification businesses. In the first-half of 2023  the SHIFT Prime and Amplify programs generated a positive EBITDA impact of +36 million euros. The Group has made significant progress toward the step-up in its prime offerings with the launch of its Nexans Fire Safety offer. This comprehensive offer revolves around the safety of people and buildings beyond cables. The Group offers a diverse range of solutions  including innovative tools to simplify cable selection and installation  and post-installation management and monitoring.Driving sustainabilityIn April 2023  Nexans made a commitment to achieve Net Zero emissions by 2050. The Group is steadfast in its determination to contribute to fighting climate change and has set ambitious targets. By 2030  it aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by -46% in Scopes 1 and 2 and by -30% in Scope 3 (both in comparison to 2019 baseline)  which surpasses initial target of -24%.

During the period  the largest contributors to sales were the Crete-Attica and Tyrrhenian Link interconnectors and Revolution  Moray West and South Fork offshore wind projects.EBITDA amounted to 30 million euros in the first-half 2023  down -66.1% compared to the first-half 2022. As anticipated  EBITDA was impacted by a combination of factors  including project mix and phasing  and one-offs. These one-offs were related to (i) the gradual ramp-up of Charleston manufacturing plant which impacted some project progress  (ii) inflation costs on some contracts and (iii) delays on EuroAsia Interconnector award.These headwinds are expected to gradually ease  thanks to an adjusted backlog 97% subsea driven  up +133% since the end of June 2022  at 5.2 billion euros at end of June 2023  excluding the EuroAsia Interconnector awarded in July 2023 for 1.43 billion euros. In the first-half 2023  the Group was awarded its largest contract ever  worth more than 1.7 billion euros  with TenneT  which consists in three turnkey 525kV HVDC projects for offshore wind farms in the German North Sea to be commissioned by 2031.With this record-high and risk-reward modelled backlog  the Halden plant in Norway  the Charleston plant in the United States  together with Nexans’ cable-laying vessels will be fully loaded until 2025  with strong backlog visibility secured up to 2028. In order to bolster its installation capabilities  Nexans has decided to invest in a new ultra-modern  technology advanced  cable-laying vessel. This advanced vessel will be equipped with a state-of-the-art logistics and handling system capable of laying four cables simultaneously and is expected to be operational by 2026.| DISTRIBUTION: Secular trends and transformation platformdriving record marginsDistribution sales amounted to 599 million euros at standard metal prices in the first-half of 2023 up +4.3% organically  compared to the first-half 2022. The segment is benefiting from expanding grid investments in Europe and North America  and demand for Accessories. EBITDA reached 82 million euros  up +73.6% versus the first-half of 2022  representing a record 13.7% margin. This substantial margin expansion reflected successful SHIFT programs deployment and high asset load level  resulting from strong demand.During the first-half 2023  the Group made significant progress in the deployment of value-added solutions to enhance customer experience  with more than 850 000 connected users (vs 540 000 in 2022) and more than 44 000 connected objects through its ULTRACKER digital services.Half-yearly trends by geography were as follows:Europe was up driven by the execution of new contracts  consistent demand from utilities to strengthen grid infrastructure  and a strong operating performance.was up driven by the execution of new contracts  consistent demand from utilities to strengthen grid infrastructure  and a strong operating performance.

As a result  EBITDA reached a record 137 million euros  with a strong EBITDA margin of 15.4% (vs 11.2% in the first-half 2022)  reflecting the continued strength in pricing and successful transformation efforts. Furthermore  the rise in prime offers and related volumes also contributed to this performance. Nexans made notable advances in the development of its Fire Safety offering (before  during and after cable installation solutions)  which forms an essential component of the Group’s strategy to increase value creation in its low-voltage product range.Half-year trends by geography were as follows:Europe benefitted from sustained pricing and resilient volumes  notably in the Nordics thanks to fire safety and prime offers.benefitted from sustained pricing and resilient volumes  notably in the Nordics thanks to fire safety and prime offers.

During the period  the largest contributors to sales were the Crete-Attica and Tyrrhenian Link interconnectors and Revolution  Moray West and South Fork offshore wind projects.EBITDA amounted to 30 million euros in the first-half 2023  down -66.1% compared to the first-half 2022. As anticipated  EBITDA was impacted by a combination of factors  including project mix and phasing  and one-offs. These one-offs were related to (i) the gradual ramp-up of Charleston manufacturing plant which impacted some project progress  (ii) inflation costs on some contracts and (iii) delays on EuroAsia Interconnector award.These headwinds are expected to gradually ease  thanks to an adjusted backlog 97% subsea driven  up +133% since the end of June 2022  at 5.2 billion euros at end of June 2023  excluding the EuroAsia Interconnector awarded in July 2023 for 1.43 billion euros. In the first-half 2023  the Group was awarded its largest contract ever  worth more than 1.7 billion euros  with TenneT  which consists in three turnkey 525kV HVDC projects for offshore wind farms in the German North Sea to be commissioned by 2031.With this record-high and risk-reward modelled backlog  the Halden plant in Norway  the Charleston plant in the United States  together with Nexans’ cable-laying vessels will be fully loaded until 2025  with strong backlog visibility secured up to 2028. In order to bolster its installation capabilities  Nexans has decided to invest in a new ultra-modern  technology advanced  cable-laying vessel. This advanced vessel will be equipped with a state-of-the-art logistics and handling system capable of laying four cables simultaneously and is expected to be operational by 2026.| DISTRIBUTION: Secular trends and transformation platform driving record marginsDistribution sales amounted to 599 million euros at standard metal prices in the first-half of 2023 up +4.3% organically  compared to the first-half 2022. The segment is benefiting from expanding grid investments in Europe and North America  and demand for Accessories. EBITDA reached 82 million euros  up +73.6% versus the first-half of 2022  representing a record 13.7% margin. This substantial margin expansion reflected successful SHIFT programs deployment and high asset load level  resulting from strong demand.During the first-half 2023  the Group made significant progress in the deployment of value-added solutions to enhance customer experience  with more than 850 000 connected users (vs 540 000 in 2022) and more than 44 000 connected objects through its ULTRACKER digital services.Half-yearly trends by geography were as follows:Europe was up driven by the execution of new contracts  consistent demand from utilities to strengthen grid infrastructure  and a strong operating performance.was up driven by the execution of new contracts  consistent demand from utilities to strengthen grid infrastructure  and a strong operating performance.

As expected  EBITDA was impacted by non-cash share-based compensation expenses of €85 million during the second quarter of 2023  as the Company rolled out its first global equity compensation plan  which began in the fourth quarter of 2022. There was no non-cash share-based compensation expense during the second quarter of 2022. EBITDA margin was 18.7%  compared to 20.0% in the second quarter of 2022. Excluding non-cash share-based compensation expense  Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was €590 million  up 16.4% year-over-year  or 19.2% in constant currency  and Adjusted EBITDA margin improved to 21.9%  compared to 20.0% in the second quarter of 2022  as a result of revenue growth  operating leverage and cash compensation savings of €24 million associated with the equity plan rollout.H1 2023 ResultsIn the half year ended June 30  2023 (""H1 2023"")  UMG's revenue increased to €5 148 million  up by 8.7% compared to the half year ended June 30  2022 (""H1 2022"")  or 9.1% in constant currency. This increase was driven by improvements across all segments  as discussed further below.Cost of revenues  consisting of artist and product costs  increased by 7.8% to €2 811 million in H1 2023  reflecting higher revenue. Cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue decreased to 54.6% in H1 2023 from 55.1% in H1 2022 primarily driven by lower merchandising product costs.EBITDA of €767 million declined 20.1% year-over-year  or 19.8% in constant currency  and EBITDA margin was 14.9% compared to 20.3% in the first half of 2022. EBITDA and EBITDA margin were impacted by non-cash share-based compensation expenses of €345 million during H1 2023 and €2 million during H1 2022. Excluding these amounts  Adjusted EBITDA of €1 112 million  was up 15.6% year-over-year in H1 2023  or 16.2% in constant currency  and Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 1.3pp year-over-year to 21.6% driven by revenue growth  operating leverage and cash compensation savings of €33 million associated with the equity plan rollout.Operating profit declined 22.9% year-over-year  or 22.3% in constant currency  to €591 million in H1 2023 due to the higher non-cash share-based compensation expenses in the first half of 2023 compared to the first half of 2022 as discussed above.Net profit attributable to equity holders of the parent in H1 2023 amounted to €625 million compared to €241 million in H1 2022  resulting in EPS of €0.34 in H1 2023  compared to €0.13 in H1 2022. The improvement in Net profit attributable to equity holders of the parent was in part due to the variance in revaluation of investments in listed and other companies (including Spotify and Tencent Music Entertainment  among others) that was a net income in H1 2023 of €313 million compared to a net expense in H1 2022 of €567 million. Adjusted net profit  which adjusts for the revaluation of investments  non-cash share-based compensation expense  amortization of catalogues and other items  amounted to €754 million in H1 2023  compared to €664 million in H1 2022  resulting in Adjusted EPS of €0.41 in H1 2023  compared to €0.37 in H1 2022. The increase in Adjusted net profit was driven by the growth in Adjusted EBITDA.Net cash provided by operating activities before income tax paid improved 16.2% to €703 million compared to €605 million in H1 2022 despite the previously disclosed €125 million paid to settle employee tax liabilities from equity grants on non-cash share-based compensation. The improvement in Net cash provided by operating activities before income tax paid was helped by the decline in royalty advance payments  net of recoupments  which was down 57.4% to €95 million in H1 2023 from €223 million in H1 2022  due to the timing of major artist renewals and an increase in recoupment.The strong Net cash provided by operating activities before income tax paid allowed the Company to continue to strategically invest in the long-term growth of the business. Strategic investments in the period included the acquisition of a 50% stake in the entity that owns the iconic Capitol Records building in Hollywood and acquisitions of a brand services company and a niche record label  among other items. Cash paid for catalogue acquisitions decreased to €89 million in H1 2023 compared to €264 million in H1 2022. Separately  investing activities also included €75 million cash put into escrow for another catalogue acquisition. Free cash flow decreased to a €13 million outflow in H1 2023 compared to a €104 million inflow in H1 2022  mainly as a result of the higher Net cash used for investing activities. The year-over-year decline in Free cash flow was also a result of higher income taxes paid and higher net interest paid  both of which benefitted from previously disclosed tax settlements in certain jurisdictions in the prior year.UMG's dividend policy is to pay a dividend of at least 50% of adjusted net profit. UMG's Board of Directors declared an interim dividend for H1 2023 of €437 million  or €0.24 per share. The ex-dividend date will be on October 4  2023  the record date will be on October 5  2023 and the payment date will be on October 27  2023.Net debt  defined as total debt minus cash and cash equivalents  at the end of H1 2023 was €2 300 million compared to €1 810 million at the end of 2022. The increase in net debt was primarily driven by the increase in cash used for investments  tax and dividends partly compensated by strong cash generated by operating activities.Recorded MusicThree Months Ended June 30  % %Six Months Ended June 30  % % (in millions of euros) 2023 2022 YoY const.2023 2022 YoY const.(unaudited) (unaudited)(unaudited) (unaudited)Subscriptions and streaming 1 426 1 314 8.5 % 11.0 %2 755 2 524 9.2 % 9.1 % of which streaming 358 348 2.9 % 5.3 %673 658 2.3 % 1.8 % of which subscription 1 068 966 10.6 % 13.0 %2 082 1 866 11.6 % 11.6 % Downloads and other digital 61 69 (11.6 %) (10.3 %)116 137 (15.3 %) (14.7 %) Physical 326 303 7.6 % 11.3 %639 540 18.3 % 20.8 % License and other 267 236 13.1 % 16.1 %493 442 11.5 % 12.6 % Recorded Music revenues 2 080 1 922 8.2 % 10.9 %4 003 3 643 9.9 % 10.3 %EBITDA698 842 (17.1 %) (16.7 %) EBITDA margin17.4 % 23.1 % (5.7pp)Adjusted EBITDA969 842 15.1 % 15.6 % Adjusted EBITDA margin24.2 % 23.1 % 1.1ppNote: % YoY indicates % change year-over-year; % const. indicates % change year-over-year adjusted for constant currency.Q2 2023Recorded Music revenue for the second quarter of 2023 was €2 080 million  up 8.2% compared to the second quarter of 2022  or 10.9% in constant currency.

As previously disclosed in UMG's Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31  2021  UMG adjusted its accounting policy in relation to certain revenues that are collected through societies (the ""Change in Society Accounting""). Of particular note  the €98 million impact associated with the Change in Society Accounting in the second quarter of 2022 reflected a one-time catch-up for the receipt of higher income than was accrued at the end of 2021. Excluding this one-time  prior-year benefit  Music Publishing revenues grew 22.8% year-over-year or 25.7% in constant currency as a result of the continued growth in streaming and subscription revenue and improvement in performance income. Digital revenue declined 23.7% year-over-year  or 22.6% in constant currency due to the Change in Society Accounting partly offset by growth in streaming and subscription revenue. Performance revenue grew 169.4% year-over-year  or 185.3% in constant currency  due to the Change in Society Accounting that had a negative impact in the prior year as well as better than expected receipts following the COVID recovery. Synchronization revenue improved 1.7% year-over-year  or 5.3% in constant currency  due to the timing of deals. Mechanical revenue grew 26.1% year-over-year  or 31.8% in constant currency  as a result of improvements in physical sales.H1 2023Music Publishing revenue amounted to €889 million in H1 2023  up 4.5% year-over-year  or 4.8% in constant currency  despite the previously disclosed Change in Society Accounting which resulted in a one-time benefit in the second quarter of 2022. Excluding this prior-year benefit  Music Publishing revenues grew 18.1% year-over-year  or 18.5% in constant currency  as a result of the continued organic growth in streaming and subscription revenue and improvement in synchronisation and performance revenue.Music Publishing EBITDA of €186 million declined 7.0% year-over-year on both a reported and constant currency basis  while Music Publishing EBITDA margin declined 2.6pp to 20.9% from 23.5% in the first half of 2022.

In prior years  these revenues were recognized when the relevant collection society notified UMG of the usage by the end customer and collectability was assured. Recognition of that revenue  in both 2022 and 2023  is based on an accrual for the best available estimate of when the usage occurs and the amount of consideration which is probable to be collected. This has affected the timing of the recognition of certain revenues across financial reporting quarters compared to periods before 2022 and also notably in the second quarter of 2022 reflected the receipt of higher income than was accrued at the end of 2021.Conference Call DetailsThe Company will host a conference call to discuss these results on July 26  2023 at 6:15PM CEST.

(“AMG”  EURONEXT AMSTERDAM: “AMG”) reported second quarter 2023 revenue of $439 million  a 4% increase versus the second quarter of 2022. Second quarter 2023 EBITDA of $107 million was 32% higher than the second quarter of 2022.In 000’s US dollars Q2 ‘23 Q2 ‘22 Change Revenue $439 319 $424 094 4% EBITDA (1) 107 453 81 126 32% Cash from operating activities 59 975 39 505 52% Net income attributable to shareholders 42 763 29 631 44% EPS - Fully diluted 1.28 0.91 Return on Capital Employed 35.7% 25.5%Note:(1) EBITDA is defined as EBIT adjusted for depreciation and amortization.Dr. Heinz Schimmelbusch  Chairman of the Management Board and CEO  said  “This is the fourth straight quarter in which AMG has exceeded $100 million of EBITDA. The $26 million  or 32%  EBITDA increase over the second quarter of 2022 was driven largely by our Clean Energy Materials segment  specifically AMG Lithium’s Brazilian operation with an EBITDA contribution of $89 million.AMG’s liquidity as of June 30  2023 was $586 million  with $391 million of unrestricted cash and $195 million of revolving credit availability. The Company will pay an interim 2023 dividend of €0.40 per ordinary share on or around August 9  2023  to shareholders of record on August 1  2023.AMG Engineering signed $167 million in new orders during the second quarter of 2023  driven by strong orders of remelting and induction furnaces  representing a 2.48x book to bill ratio. AMG’s order backlog of $337 million as of June 30  2023  which is the highest in AMG’s history. This is largely driven by the US aerospace market. Our second quarter 2023 US order intake has essentially doubled from our second quarter 2022 US order intake.We continue to drive our lithium strategy forward and are pleased to announce that we have signed a mandate letter with KfW IPEX-Bank GmbH and with Citi to structure and arrange the financing for the construction of our proposed technical-grade lithium chemical plant in Brazil. The financing structure is expected to cover all the funding requirements and be supported by Euler Hermes (the German Export Credit Agency representing its government) under its Untied Loan Guarantee program for projects which deliver critical raw materials into Germany. This proposed financing is a cornerstone of our lithium strategy to be the premier supplier of battery-grade lithium hydroxide in Europe  and another important step towards an independent and sustainable lithium supply chain for Europe. In addition  this project conforms with AMG Brazil’s commitment to upgrade its operations to produce a higher value product  while significantly contributing to reducing CO 2 emissions by lowering total volumes shipped.”Strategic HighlightsLithiumThe lithium concentrate production expansion project in AMG Brazil is progressing as planned.AMG signed a mandate letter with KfW IPEX-Bank GmbH and Citi to structure and arrange the financing for the construction of our proposed technical-grade lithium chemical plant in Brazil.

This proposed financing is a cornerstone of our strategy to be the premier supplier of battery-grade lithium hydroxide in Europe.AMG Lithium’s hydroxide refinery in Bitterfeld  Germany  Europe’s first  is expected to start commissioning for the first 20 000-ton module expected in the fourth quarter of 2023.AMG Lithium signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding (“MOU”) in May 2023 with Fortum Battery Recycling Oy (“Fortum”)  a Nordic clean energy provider. Fortum’s new commercial scale hydrometallurgical plant is able to efficiently recover valuable metals from old electric vehicle lithium-ion batteries. The lithium product recovered by Fortum will be delivered to AMG Lithium for further processing.VanadiumThe new vanadium spent catalyst recycling facility in Zanesville  Ohio  is currently running at full capacity and targeting full run rate production for the second half of 2023.AMG’s innovative lithium vanadium battery (“LIVA”) projects for industrial power management applications outlined at our Capital Markets Day are under various stages of construction.In January 2023  AMG started building a vanadium electrolyte plant at its subsidiary  AMG Titanium  in Nuremberg  Germany. The target capacity is 6 000 m³ vanadium electrolyte  which will serve the electricity storage market. Production is expected to start at the end of this year.Shell & AMG Recycling B.V. (“SARBV”) project development in the Middle East are progressing. The Supercenter project in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is completing the FEL3 feasibility study later this year.Financial HighlightsRevenue increased by 4% to $439 million in the second quarter of 2023 from $424 million in the second quarter of 2022.EBITDA was $107 million in the second quarter of 2023  up 32% versus the second quarter 2022 EBITDA of $81 million.Annualized return on capital employed was 35.7% for the first six months of 2023  compared to 25.5% for the same period in 2022.Cash from operations was $60 million for the second quarter of 2023  compared to $40 million in the second quarter of 2022  driven by the high profitability of AMG Lithium in Brazil.Net income attributable to shareholders for the second quarter of 2023 was $43 million  yielding $1.28 diluted earnings per share compared to $0.91 in the same period in 2022.AMG’s liquidity as of June 30  2023 was $586 million  with $391 million of unrestricted cash and $195 million of revolving credit availability.AMG declares an interim dividend of €0.40 per ordinary share  to be paid in the third quarter of 2023.Key FiguresIn 000’s US dollars Q2 ‘23 Q2 ‘22 Change Revenue $439 319 $424 094 4% Gross profit 127 534 102 240 25% Gross margin 29.0% 24.1% Operating profit 78 167 65 246 20% Operating margin 17.8% 15.4% Net income attributable to shareholders 42 763 29 631 44% EPS - Fully diluted 1.28 0.91 41% EBIT (1) 93 780 69 763 34% EBITDA (2) 107 453 81 126 32% EBITDA margin 24.5% 19.1% Cash from operating activities 59 975 39 505 52%Notes:(1) EBIT is defined as earnings before interest and income taxes.

AMG has commenced an arbitration claim seeking compensatory damages  which include costs incurred and lost profitability.During the second quarter of 2023  a total of 28 870 dry metric tons (“dmt”) of lithium concentrates was sold. The second quarter experienced increased sales volumes due to shipping schedule variances which will negatively impact the third quarter. The average realized sales price was $3 633/dmt CIF China for the quarter. The average cost per ton for the quarter was $547/dmt CIF China. The cost per ton is higher than the first quarter due to lower volumes and pricing in tantalum concentrate in the quarter. The additional lithium concentrate shipments and slightly higher costs in tantalum concentrate resulted in quarterly EBITDA for AMG Brazil of $89 million.AMG Critical MineralsQ2 ‘23 Q2 ‘22 Change Revenue $57 271 $103 416 (45%) Gross profit 7 806 14 028 (44%) Operating profit 169 7 086 (98%) EBITDA 1 532 9 069 (83%)AMG Critical Minerals’ revenue for the second quarter of 2023 decreased by 45%  to $57 million  mainly due to lower volumes across the segment largely driven by the silicon metal plant operating one furnace during the quarter  as discussed in detail below. The segment also suffered from a slowdown in the European industrial economy.Gross profit of $8 million in the second quarter was 44% lower compared to the second quarter of 2022  largely due to the lower volumes in the current quarter.SG&A expenses in the second quarter of 2023 increased by 8%  to $8 million  compared to the same period in 2022. This was largely driven by higher professional fees in the current quarter.The second quarter 2023 EBITDA decreased 83% compared to the same period in 2022  to $2 million  due to the lower gross profit as noted above.AMG Silicon operated one of four furnaces throughout the second quarter and plans to operate one furnace for the remainder of 2023. The operational parameters of the silicon business will continue to be reviewed on an ongoing basis. Due to the noted interruptions in silicon operations  the financial impact of the business will be excluded from EBITDA during this period of abnormal operations. However  AMG Silicon generated $9 million in cash flow from operating activities during the quarter driven by the receipt of energy sales made in the fourth quarter of 2022.AMG Critical Materials TechnologiesQ2 ‘23 Q2 ‘22 Change Revenue $173 561 $160 916 8% Gross profit 23 743 27 391 (13%) Operating profit 3 620 8 456 (57%) EBITDA 9 947 13 825 (28%)AMG Critical Materials Technologies' second quarter 2023 revenue increased by $13 million  or 8%  compared to the same period in 2022. This improvement was driven by strong revenues in our engineering unit  as well as higher sales volumes of titanium alloys and chrome metal  partially offset by lower chrome metal pricing.SG&A expenses increased by 8% in the second quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022  due to additional personnel at AMG Engineering and AMG LIVA corresponding to the record order backlog and business development  respectively.AMG Critical Materials Technologies’ EBITDA was $10 million during the quarter compared to $14 million in the same period of 2022. The decrease was primarily due to lower chrome prices in the second quarter of 2023 partially offset by higher profitability in Engineering and Titanium.AMG Engineering signed $167 million in new orders during the second quarter of 2023  driven by strong orders of remelting and induction furnaces  representing a 2.48x book to bill ratio. Order backlog was $337 million as of June 30  2023  the highest in AMG’s history.Financial ReviewTaxAMG recorded an income tax expense of $27 million in the second quarter of 2023  compared to $23 million in the same period in 2022. This variance was mainly driven by higher profitability in AMG Lithium at its Brazil operation  offset by US tax expense and movements in the Brazilian real. The effects of the Brazilian real caused a $2 million tax benefit in the second quarter of 2023  compared to a $4 million tax expense in the same period in 2022. Fluctuations in the Brazilian real exchange rate impact the valuation of the Company’s net deferred tax positions related to our operations in Brazil.AMG paid taxes of $35 million in the second quarter of 2023  compared to tax payments of $9 million in the second quarter of 2022. The higher cash taxes in the current quarter were a result of tax payments tracking the consistent upward trend in Brazil results.Exceptional ItemsAMG’s second quarter 2023 gross profit includes exceptional items  which are not included in the calculation of EBITDA.A summary of exceptional items included in gross profit in the second quarters of 2023 and 2022 are below:Exceptional items included in gross profitQ2 ‘23 Q2 ‘22 Change Gross profit $127 534 $102 240 25% Inventory cost adjustment 3 678 — N/A Restructuring expense 626 41 1427% Silicon’s partial closure (1 011) — N/A Strategic project (reversal) expense (55) 833 N/A Gross profit excluding exceptional items 130 772 103 114 27%AMG Vanadium had a $3.7 million non-cash expense during the second quarter of 2023. This is a result of inventory cost adjustments associated with declining prices and inventory specification issues due to the acquisition and testing of global refinery waste which has been adjusted in EBITDA.SG&AAMG’s second quarter 2023 SG&A expenses were $49 million compared to $37 million in the second quarter of 2022  with the increase largely attributable to higher personnel costs driven by increased hiring in our Lithium  Engineering  and LIVA businesses. It was also driven by a one-time pension expense of $6.7 million due to the restructuring of executive employee benefit plans.LiquidityJune 30  2023 December 31  2022 Change Senior secured debt $338 505 $348 622 (3%) Cash & cash equivalents 391 251 346 043 13% Senior secured net (cash) debt (52 746) 2 579 N/A Other debt 14 987 14 959 —% Net (cash) debt excluding municipal bond (37 759) 17 538 N/A Municipal bond debt 319 124 319 244 —% Restricted cash 1 440 6 920 (79%) Net debt 279 925 329 862 (15%)AMG ended the second quarter in a $280 million net debt position. This decrease versus year-end 2022 was mainly due to higher cash balances from strong operating cash flow.AMG continued to maintain a strong balance sheet and adequate sources of liquidity during the second quarter. As of June 30  2023  the Company had $391 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and $195 million available on its revolving credit facility. As such  AMG had $586 million of total liquidity as of June 30  2023.Net Finance CostsAMG’s second quarter 2023 net finance cost was $7 million compared to $12 million in the second quarter of 2022. This variance was mainly driven by higher interest income earned  due to the overall increase in global interest rates  and an increase in cash and cash equivalents balances as well as foreign exchange losses in the prior period. Additionally  in today’s rising rate environment  AMG continues to benefit from its low-cost fixed-rate debt facilities. AMG has an average interest rate charge across its two main debt instruments of 5%.OutlookGiven the global economic uncertainty and the slowdown in China  current spot prices across AMG’s critical materials portfolio are significantly below the prices we experienced when we announced our initial guidance for 2023 in November 2022. The price of lithium carbonate in November 2022  the date of our $400 million EBITDA guidance  has now almost halved and our other relevant portfolio prices are down an average of 25%.Therefore  we have changed our full year EBITDA guidance for 2023 from “exceeding $400 million in EBITDA” to “a range between $350 million to $380 million in EBITDA.” An EBITDA in this range represents the highest EBITDA in the history of AMG.As previously disclosed  third quarter profitability will be negatively impacted by lower volumes associated with the spodumene expansion project. Volumes will recover in the fourth quarter as the project begins to ramp up.Regarding our long-term guidance  we are extremely pleased with the advancement of our strategic projects. We are moving forward with our lithium concentrate expansion in Brazil. We’ve signed a mandate letter to fund the chemical upgrader in Brazil  and our lithium hydroxide refinery in Bitterfeld  Germany  is under construction  with commissioning for the first 20 000-ton module expected in the fourth quarter of 2023.These transformational projects in lithium  our newly complete ferrovanadium spent catalyst recycling facility in Ohio  and the continued ramp-up in our AMG Critical Materials Technologies segment will drive increased volumes across our Clean Energy Materials segment and confirm our confidence in our long-term guidance. Our long-term guidance therefore remains unchanged at an EBITDA level of $650 million  or more  in 5 years  or earlier.Profit for the period to adjusted EBITDA reconciliationQ2 ‘23 Q2 ‘22 Profit for the period $43 573 $29 879 Income tax expense 26 552 23 156 Net finance cost 7 282 12 211 Equity-settled share-based payment transactions 1 495 1 372 Restructuring expense 626 41 Pension adjustment 6 700 — Silicon’s partial closure (362) — Inventory cost adjustment 3 678 — Strategic project expense (1) 3 476 3 107 Share of loss of associates 760 — Others — (3) EBIT 93 780 69 763 Depreciation and amortization 13 673 11 363 EBITDA 107 453 81 126Notes:(1) The Company is in the initial development and ramp-up phases for several strategic expansion projects  including AMG Vanadium’s expansion project  the joint venture with Shell  Hybrid Lithium Vanadium Redox Flow Battery System  and the lithium expansion in Germany  which incurred project expenses during the quarter but are not yet operational.

As expected  EBITDA was impacted by non-cash share-based compensation expenses of €85 million during the second quarter of 2023  as the Company rolled out its first global equity compensation plan  which began in the fourth quarter of 2022. There was no non-cash share-based compensation expense during the second quarter of 2022. EBITDA margin was 18.7%  compared to 20.0% in the second quarter of 2022. Excluding non-cash share-based compensation expense  Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was €590 million  up 16.4% year-over-year  or 19.2% in constant currency  and Adjusted EBITDA margin improved to 21.9%  compared to 20.0% in the second quarter of 2022  as a result of revenue growth  operating leverage and cash compensation savings of €24 million associated with the equity plan rollout.H1 2023 ResultsIn the half year ended June 30  2023 (""H1 2023"")  UMG's revenue increased to €5 148 million  up by 8.7% compared to the half year ended June 30  2022 (""H1 2022"")  or 9.1% in constant currency. This increase was driven by improvements across all segments  as discussed further below.Cost of revenues  consisting of artist and product costs  increased by 7.8% to €2 811 million in H1 2023  reflecting higher revenue. Cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue decreased to 54.6% in H1 2023 from 55.1% in H1 2022 primarily driven by lower merchandising product costs.EBITDA of €767 million declined 20.1% year-over-year  or 19.8% in constant currency  and EBITDA margin was 14.9% compared to 20.3% in the first half of 2022. EBITDA and EBITDA margin were impacted by non-cash share-based compensation expenses of €345 million during H1 2023 and €2 million during H1 2022. Excluding these amounts  Adjusted EBITDA of €1 112 million  was up 15.6% year-over-year in H1 2023  or 16.2% in constant currency  and Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 1.3pp year-over-year to 21.6% driven by revenue growth  operating leverage and cash compensation savings of €33 million associated with the equity plan rollout.Operating profit declined 22.9% year-over-year  or 22.3% in constant currency  to €591 million in H1 2023 due to the higher non-cash share-based compensation expenses in the first half of 2023 compared to the first half of 2022 as discussed above.Net profit attributable to equity holders of the parent in H1 2023 amounted to €625 million compared to €241 million in H1 2022  resulting in EPS of €0.34 in H1 2023  compared to €0.13 in H1 2022. The improvement in Net profit attributable to equity holders of the parent was in part due to the variance in revaluation of investments in listed and other companies (including Spotify and Tencent Music Entertainment  among others) that was a net income in H1 2023 of €313 million compared to a net expense in H1 2022 of €567 million. Adjusted net profit  which adjusts for the revaluation of investments  non-cash share-based compensation expense  amortization of catalogues and other items  amounted to €754 million in H1 2023  compared to €664 million in H1 2022  resulting in Adjusted EPS of €0.41 in H1 2023  compared to €0.37 in H1 2022. The increase in Adjusted net profit was driven by the growth in Adjusted EBITDA.Net cash provided by operating activities before income tax paid improved 16.2% to €703 million compared to €605 million in H1 2022 despite the previously disclosed €125 million paid to settle employee tax liabilities from equity grants on non-cash share-based compensation. The improvement in Net cash provided by operating activities before income tax paid was helped by the decline in royalty advance payments  net of recoupments  which was down 57.4% to €95 million in H1 2023 from €223 million in H1 2022  due to the timing of major artist renewals and an increase in recoupment.The strong Net cash provided by operating activities before income tax paid allowed the Company to continue to strategically invest in the long-term growth of the business. Strategic investments in the period included the acquisition of a 50% stake in the entity that owns the iconic Capitol Records building in Hollywood and acquisitions of a brand services company and a niche record label  among other items. Cash paid for catalogue acquisitions decreased to €89 million in H1 2023 compared to €264 million in H1 2022. Separately  investing activities also included €75 million cash put into escrow for another catalogue acquisition. Free cash flow decreased to a €13 million outflow in H1 2023 compared to a €104 million inflow in H1 2022  mainly as a result of the higher Net cash used for investing activities. The year-over-year decline in Free cash flow was also a result of higher income taxes paid and higher net interest paid  both of which benefitted from previously disclosed tax settlements in certain jurisdictions in the prior year.UMG's dividend policy is to pay a dividend of at least 50% of adjusted net profit. UMG's Board of Directors declared an interim dividend for H1 2023 of €437 million  or €0.24 per share. The ex-dividend date will be on October 4  2023  the record date will be on October 5  2023 and the payment date will be on October 27  2023.Net debt  defined as total debt minus cash and cash equivalents  at the end of H1 2023 was €2 300 million compared to €1 810 million at the end of 2022. The increase in net debt was primarily driven by the increase in cash used for investments  tax and dividends partly compensated by strong cash generated by operating activities.Recorded MusicThree Months Ended June 30  % %Six Months Ended June 30  % % (in millions of euros) 2023 2022 YoY const.2023 2022 YoY const.(unaudited) (unaudited)(unaudited) (unaudited)Subscriptions and streaming 1 426 1 314 8.5 % 11.0 %2 755 2 524 9.2 % 9.1 % of which streaming 358 348 2.9 % 5.3 %673 658 2.3 % 1.8 % of which subscription 1 068 966 10.6 % 13.0 %2 082 1 866 11.6 % 11.6 % Downloads and other digital 61 69 (11.6 %) (10.3 %)116 137 (15.3 %) (14.7 %) Physical 326 303 7.6 % 11.3 %639 540 18.3 % 20.8 % License and other 267 236 13.1 % 16.1 %493 442 11.5 % 12.6 % Recorded Music revenues 2 080 1 922 8.2 % 10.9 %4 003 3 643 9.9 % 10.3 %EBITDA698 842 (17.1 %) (16.7 %) EBITDA margin17.4 % 23.1 % (5.7pp)Adjusted EBITDA969 842 15.1 % 15.6 % Adjusted EBITDA margin24.2 % 23.1 % 1.1ppNote: % YoY indicates % change year-over-year; % const. indicates % change year-over-year adjusted for constant currency.Q2 2023Recorded Music revenue for the second quarter of 2023 was €2 080 million  up 8.2% compared to the second quarter of 2022  or 10.9% in constant currency. Subscription revenue grew 10.6% year-over-year  or 13.0% in constant currency  driven primarily by the growth in global subscribers as well as the impact of price increases at certain platforms. Streaming revenue grew 2.9% year-over-year  or 5.3% in constant currency  as certain platforms and countries grew  but the performance of the broader advertising industry was mixed. Physical revenue increased by 7.6% year-over-year  or 11.3% in constant currency  driven by strong CD sales in Japan and improvements in vinyl sales.

In prior years  these revenues were recognized when the relevant collection society notified UMG of the usage by the end customer and collectability was assured. Recognition of that revenue  in both 2022 and 2023  is based on an accrual for the best available estimate of when the usage occurs and the amount of consideration which is probable to be collected. This has affected the timing of the recognition of certain revenues across financial reporting quarters compared to periods before 2022 and also notably in the second quarter of 2022 reflected the receipt of higher income than was accrued at the end of 2021.Conference Call DetailsThe Company will host a conference call to discuss these results on July 26  2023 at 6:15PM CEST.

The increase was driven by favorable pricing and mix  lower brand support  and favorable net sales leverage.

US H1 2023 performance was impacted by H1 2022 phasing. Excluding this impact  net sales would have grown by 5.5% at constant currency.In the US  the total lighter market declined 5.6% in volume and 1.4% in value8. However  BIC maintained its leadership position  gaining share in volume  +0.7 pts  and value  +0.9 pts  topping its competitors thanks to positive price and mix. Our innovative utility pocket lighter  BIC EZ Reach  continued to outperform the market  gaining 1.2 pts in value  boosted by advertising campaigns and distribution expansion in all channels.

Growth remains broad-based  with all geographies contributing.These past few months  we made consistent progress on our strategic agenda  further strengthening our Core  investing behind our winners and actively addressing our underperformers. And while we see green shoots of success across the portfolio - exemplified by the continued performance of International Delight  Aptamil  evian and YoPro  or the encouraging momentum behind Mizone – we know the job is not done. We remain  more than ever  focused on building further resilience into Danone  by further stepping up our execution  but also by leveraging increasingly more our Science  Operations and Investments.Importantly  the last 18 months’ efforts on restoring the fundamentals are starting to pay: our gross margin has expanded in the first half of the year  which allows us to significantly invest behind our brands – 99bps in the first half – while improving margins moderately and delivering healthy free cash flows. In short  we are progressing towards the business model we strive for.While a lot remains to be done  this makes us look at the future with confidence: this year  we expect to deliver a like-for-like sales growth in the upper end of our +4 and +6% guidance  underpinned by sequential volume/mix improvement in the second half  and moderate recurring operating margin improvement.”I.

China  North Asia & Oceania posted sales growth of +9.6% on a like-for-like basis  led by +0.8% growth in price and +8.8% growth in volume/mix. In China  Aptamil continued to deliver solid growth in Infant Nutrition  coupled with further market share gains  while Nutrison and Neocate posted strong growth in Adult Nutrition and Pediatric Specialties respectively. In Waters  Mizone registered mid-teens growth  driven by volumes  with market share gains  while in EDP  Japan delivered another quarter of double-digit growth. Latin America posted sales growth of +10.8% on a like-for-like basis  with a +12.9% increase in price and a -2.0% decline in volume/mix  led by Danonino and Danette in Mexico and by Danone and Yopro in Brazil. In the Rest of the World  the performance normalized in the second quarter  after favorable calendar effects in Q1. Sales were up +3.9% on a like-for-like basis  with price up +8.2% and volume/mix down -4.3%  led by key Specialized Nutrition platforms.Recurring Operating MarginRecurring operating profit (€m) and margin (%)H1 2022 H1 2023 Change €m Margin (%) €m Margin (%) Reported Like-for-likeBY GEOGRAPHICAL ZONE Europe 574 12.9% 497 10.6% -232 bps -290 bps North America3 254 8.1% 353 10.3% +222 bps +229 bps China  North Asia & Oceania2 534 32.0% 549 30.9% -107 bps -156 bps Latin America 3 -1 -0.1% 42 2.8% +291 bps +155 bps Rest of the World 251 9.1% 294 10.4% +127 bps +13 bpsBY CATEGORY EDP 494 7.0% 605 8.1% +107 bps +102 bps Specialized Nutrition 933 23.2% 885 20.8% -235 bps -351 bps Waters 185 8.3% 244 10.1% +185 bps +116 bps Total 1 612 12.1% 1 734 12.2% +14 bps -30 bpsDanone’s recurring operating income reached €1.7 bn in H1 2023. Recurring operating margin stood at 12.2%  up +14 basis points (bps) compared to last year. This increase was mainly driven by the improvement of topline drivers – including volume  mix and price – for a combined estimated impact of c. +630 bps. This positive effect was partially offset by the still strong negative impact of input-cost inflation net of productivity  at c. -540 bps.Besides  Danone continued to step-up its reinvestments in A&P  product superiority and capabilities  that had a negative effect of -99 bps in H1 2023. Finally  Overheads before reinvestments had a positive effect of +7 bps.In addition to operating effects  reported margin also includes the positive impact of Forex and others  changes in scope  and contribution from hyperinflation  as well as the negative effects from other income and expenses  for a total combined effect of +13 bps.Net income and Earnings per shareH1 2022 H1 2023 in millions of euros except if stated otherwise Recurring Non-recurring Total Recurring Non-recurring Total Recurring operating income 1 612 1 612 1 734 1 734 Other operating income and expense (233) (233) (53) (53) Operating income 1 612 (233) 1 380 1 734 (53) 1 681 Cost of net debt (78) (78) (74) (74) Other financial income and expense (69) 6 (63) (67) (15) (83) Income before taxes 1 466 (227) 1 239 1 593 (68) 1 525 Income tax (403) 28 (376) (435) 6 (429) Effective tax rate 27.5% 30.3% 27.3% 28.1% Net income from fully consolidated companies 1 063 (199) 863 1 158 (62) 1 095 Share of profit (loss) of equity-accounted companies 25 (114) (89) 14 19 33 Net income 1 088 (313) 774 1 172 (44) 1 129 • Group share 1 051 (314) 737 1 133 (40) 1 093 • Non-controlling interests 37 0 37 39 (3) 36 EPS (€) 1.63 1.14 1.76 1.70Other operating income and expense reached -€53 million in H1 2023  vs -€233 million in the prior year.

EDP RUSSIA UPDATEOn October 14  2022  Danone launched a process to transfer the control of its EDP (Essential Dairy & Plant-based) Business in Russia  which was progressing according to the expected schedule.On July 16  2023  Danone has taken note of the decision of the Russian authorities aiming at placing Danone Russia (EDP) under the temporary external administration of the Russian Federal Agency for State Property Management (Rosimushchestvo).On July 18  2023  the Russian authorities indicated that the Board of Directors and CEO of Danone Russia (EDP) had been changed. These changes took place without the knowledge of  or approval by  Danone. While Danone no longer retains control of the management of its EDP operations in Russia  it remains their legal owner.As a result  and as per applicable accounting standards (IFRS)  Danone will deconsolidate its EDP Russia operations in July 2023  triggering an approximately €(0.2)bn cash impairment. In addition  Danone recognizes a non-cash RUB / EUR FX translation difference of approximately €(0.5)bn  which has no impact on Group’s total equity. Both will be recognized on December 31  2023.EDP Russia will therefore be taken out of Danone’s like for like perimeter as of July 2023; Danone’s H2 2023 recurring performance will be reported excluding the contribution of EDP Russia.Danone will continue to investigate the situation to understand the implications of the decisions of the Russian authorities on the ongoing EDP operations of Danone in Russia  as well as on the ongoing sale process. Danone will continue to provide information on material developments related to the situation of its EDP operations in Russia and keeps investigating how to protect its assets and its rights as shareholder  with a first priority to ensure people safety.III. 2023 GUIDANCELike-for-like sales growth expected between +4 and +6%  with moderate recurring operating margin improvement.IV. MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS OVER THE PERIODApril 27  2023: At Danone’s 2023 Annual General Meeting  shareholders approved all resolutions submitted to its approval by the Board of Directors  including the distribution of a dividend of €2.00 per share in cash  the appointment of Sanjiv Mehta as Director  the renewals of terms of office of Valérie Chapoulaud-Floquet and Gilles Schnepp  and the ratification of the co-opting of Gilbert Ghostine and Lise Kingo  as Directors.At Danone’s 2023 Annual General Meeting  shareholders approved all resolutions submitted to its approval by the Board of Directors  including the distribution of a dividend of €2.00 per share in cash  the appointment of Sanjiv Mehta as Director  the renewals of terms of office of Valérie Chapoulaud-Floquet and Gilles Schnepp  and the ratification of the co-opting of Gilbert Ghostine and Lise Kingo  as Directors. May 15  2023: Danone issued a €800 million bond with an 8-year maturity and a 3.47% coupon. The settlement took place on May 22  2023  and the bonds are listed on Euronext Paris.V. NEW FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE PRO FORMAFinancial disclosureDanone’s external reporting has been adjusted to reflect the organizational changes. Starting from Q1 2023  the company reports its key indicators (net sales  like-for-like sales growth  recurring operating income and recurring operating margin) along five adjusted operating segments:Europe  which includes Ukraine (was previously part of Rest of the World zone);North America  which includes the United States and Canada (unchanged);China  North Asia  Oceania (unchanged);Latin America (was previously part of Rest of the World zone);Rest of the World  which includes AMEA (Asia  Middle East including Turkey  Africa) and CIS.The global category reporting remains unchanged  and Danone continues to report performance  on both net sales and recurring operating income and margin  for EDP  Specialized Nutrition and Waters.Like-For-Like d efinitionAll countries with hyperinflationary economies are now included in our like-for-like changes. However  in order to limit the distorting effect of hyperinflation  net sales growth in excess of around 26% per year are excluded from like-for-like net sales growth calculation in hyperinflationary economies. Indeed  a three-year average at 26% would generally trigger hyperinflation as defined by IFRS rules.H1 and FY 2022 sales restated by new operating segments and new LFL methodologyH1 2022Europe North America China/North Asia/Oceania AMEA  CIS & Latin America Total Net sales (€m) LFL sales growth (%) Net sales (€m) LFL sales growth (%) Net sales (€m) LFL sales growth (%) Net sales (€m) LFL sales growth (%) Net sales (€m) LFL sales growth (%) EDP 2 087 -0.2% 2 851 +6.4% 166 +9.6% 1 958 +7.9% 7 062 +4.7% Specialized Nutrition 1 485 +8.4% 174 +14.0% 1 160 +15.0% 1 209 +6.1% 4 029 +9.7% Waters 859 +11.4% 114 +18.3% 345 -9.9% 916 +14.2% 2 234 +8.8% Total Company 4 431 +4.7% 3 139 +7.2% 1 671 +8.3% 4 083 +8.6% 13 325 +6.9%FY 2022Europe North America China/North Asia/Oceania AMEA  CIS & Latin America Total Net sales (€m) LFL sales growth (%) Net sales (€m) LFL sales growth (%) Net sales (€m) LFL sales growth (%) Net sales (€m) LFL sales growth (%) Net sales (€m) LFL sales growth (%) EDP 4 137 +0.6% 6 085 +8.1% 340 +12.4% 4 237 +8.0% 14 799 +5.8% Specialized Nutrition 2 977 +8.3% 376 +15.6% 2 431 +9.3% 2 535 +9.7% 8 319 +9.3% Waters 1 757 +8.5% 251 +19.0% 656 -4.4% 1 879 +10.2% 4 543 +7.5% Total Company 8 871 +4.6% 6 712 +8.9% 3 428 +6.7% 8 651 +9.0% 27 661 +7.1%H1 and FY 2022 margin restated by new operating segmentsRecurring operating profit (€m)and margin (%)H1 2022 FY 2022 €m Margin (%) €m Margin (%)BY GEOGRAPHICAL ZONE Europe 574 12.9% 1 084 12.2% North America4 254 8.1% 679 10.1% China  North Asia & Oceania2 534 32.0% 1 037 30.2% Latin America 3 -1 -0.1% 55 1.9% Rest of the World 251 9.1% 522 8.9%BY CATEGORY EDP 494 7.0% 1 207 8.2% Specialized Nutrition 933 23.2% 1 799 21.6% Waters 185 8.3% 370 8.2% Total 1 612 12.1% 3 377 12.2%VI. ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES NOT DEFINED BY IFRSIAS 29: impact on reported dataAll necessary conditions have been reached (including 3-year cumulative rate of inflation for consumer prices exceeding the 100% threshold reached during the first half 2022) to now consider Turkey as “hyperinflationary” as defined by IFRS rules and therefore that IAS 29 rule related to Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies becomes applicable to the country. Consequently  Danone applies IAS 29 in Turkey with an effective date of January 1st  2022.Adoption of IAS 29 in hyperinflationary countries requires its non-monetary assets and liabilities and its income statement to be restated to reflect the changes in the general pricing power of its functional currency  leading to a gain or loss on the net monetary position included in the net income. Moreover  its financial statements are converted into euros using the closing exchange rate of the relevant period.IAS 29: impact on reported data€ million except % Q2 2023 H1 2023 Sales -17.7 -54.2 Sales growth (%) -0.24% -0.38% Recurring Operating Income -35 Recurring Net Income – Group share -72Breakdown by quarter of H1 202 3 sales after application of IAS 29H1 2023 sales correspond to the addition of:Q2 2023 reported sales;Q1 2023 sales resulting from the application of IAS 29 until June 30  2023  to sales of entities in hyperinflation countries (application of the inflation rate until June 30  2023  and translation into euros using the June 30 2023  closing rate) and provided in the table below for information (unaudited data).€ million Q1 20231 Q2 2023 H1 2023 Europe 2 248 2 429 4 677 North America 1 714 1 704 3 418 China  North Asia & Oceania 824 954 1 778 Latin America 687 779 1 466 Rest of the World 1 459 1 369 2 828 Total 6 932 7 235 14 1671Results from the application of IAS 29 until June 30  2023  to Q1 sales of entities of hyperinflation countries.Financial indicators not defined in IFRSDue to rounding  the sum of values presented may differ from totals as reported.

Other operating income and expenses comprise items that  because of their significant or unusual nature  cannot be viewed as inherent to Danone’s recurring activity and have limited predictive value  thus distorting the assessment of its recurring operating performance and its evolution. These mainly include:capital gains and losses on disposals of fully consolidated companies;impairment charges on intangible assets with indefinite useful lives;costs related to strategic restructurings or transformation plans;costs related to major external growth transactions;costs related to major crisis and major litigations;in connection with IFRS 3 (Revised) and IAS 27 (Revised) relating to business combinations  (i) acquisition costs related to business combinations  (ii) revaluation profit or loss accounted for following a loss of control  and (iii) changes in earn-outs relating to business combinations and subsequent to acquisition date.Recurring operating margin is defined as Recurring operating income over Sales ratio.Other non-recurring financial income and expense corresponds to financial income and expense items that  in view of their significant or unusual nature  cannot be considered as inherent to Danone’s recurring financial management. These mainly include changes in value of non-consolidated interests.Non-recurring income tax corresponds to income tax on non-recurring items as well as tax income and expense items that  in view of their significant or unusual nature  cannot be considered as inherent to Danone’s recurring performance.Recurring effective tax rate measures the effective tax rate of Danone’s recurring performance and is computed as the ratio of income tax related to recurring items over recurring net income before tax.Non-recurring share of profit of equity-accounted companies includes items that  because of their significant or unusual nature  cannot be viewed as inherent to the companies' recurring activity and thereby distort the assessment of their recurring performance and trends in that performance. These items mainly relate to (i) capital gains and losses on disposals of investments in equity-accounted companies  (ii) impairment of goodwill  and (iii) non-recurring items  as defined by Danone  included in the share of profit of equity-accounted companies.Recurring net income (or Recurring net income – Group Share) corresponds to the Group share of the consolidated Recurring net income. The Recurring net income excludes items that  because of their significant or unusual nature  cannot be viewed as inherent to Danone’s recurring activity and have limited predictive value  thus distorting the assessment of its recurring performance and its evolution. Such non-recurring income and expenses correspond to Other operating income and expenses  Other non-recurring financial income and expenses  Non-recurring income tax  and Non-recurring income from equity-accounted companies. Such income and expenses  excluded from Net income  represent Non-recurring net income.Recurring EPS (or Recurring net income – Group Share  per share after dilution) is defined as the ratio of Recurring net income adjusted for hybrid financing over Diluted number of shares. In compliance with IFRS  income used to calculate EPS is adjusted for the coupon related to the hybrid financing accrued for the period and presented net of tax.H1 2022 H1 2023 Recurring Total Recurring Total Net income-Group share (€ million) 1 051 737 1 133 1 093 Coupon related to hybrid financing net of tax (€ million) (7) (7) (6) (6) Number of shares • Before dilution 638 514 268 638 514 268 640 196 786 640 196 786 • After dilution 638 827 268 638 827 268 640 804 805 640 804 805 EPS (€) • Before dilution 1.64 1.14 1.76 1.70 • After dilution 1.63 1.14 1.76 1.70Free cash flow represents cash flows provided or used by operating activities less capital expenditure net of disposals and  in connection with IFRS 3 (Revised)  relating to business combinations  excluding (i) acquisition costs related to business combinations  and (ii) earn-outs related to business combinations and paid subsequently to acquisition date.(€ million) H1 2022 H1 2023 Cash-flow from operating activities 970 1 424 Capital expenditure (318) (310) Disposal of tangible assets & transaction fees related to business combinations1 22 10 Free cash-flow 674 1 1241 Represents acquisition costs related to business combinations paid during the period.Net financial debt represents the net debt portion bearing interest.

Growth remains broad-based  with all geographies contributing.These past few months  we made consistent progress on our strategic agenda  further strengthening our Core  investing behind our winners and actively addressing our underperformers. And while we see green shoots of success across the portfolio - exemplified by the continued performance of International Delight  Aptamil  evian and YoPro  or the encouraging momentum behind Mizone – we know the job is not done. We remain  more than ever  focused on building further resilience into Danone  by further stepping up our execution  but also by leveraging increasingly more our Science  Operations and Investments.Importantly  the last 18 months’ efforts on restoring the fundamentals are starting to pay: our gross margin has expanded in the first half of the year  which allows us to significantly invest behind our brands – 99bps in the first half – while improving margins moderately and delivering healthy free cash flows. In short  we are progressing towards the business model we strive for.While a lot remains to be done  this makes us look at the future with confidence: this year  we expect to deliver a like-for-like sales growth in the upper end of our +4 and +6% guidance  underpinned by sequential volume/mix improvement in the second half  and moderate recurring operating margin improvement.”I. SECOND QUARTER AND HALF-YEAR SALESSecond quarter and half -year salesIn Q2 2023  consolidated sales stood at €7.2 bn  up +6.4% on a like-for-like basis  with a +8.7% contribution from price and a -2.3% contribution from volume/mix. On a reported basis  sales increased by +2.4%  reflecting notably a negative impact from forex (-4.3%) and scope (-0.4%)  and a positive contribution of hyperinflation (+1.3%).In H1 2023  consolidated sales stood at €14.2 bn  up +8.4% on a like-for-like basis  with a +9.4% contribution from price and a -1.1% contribution from volume/mix. On a reported basis  sales increased by +6.3%  notably penalized by a negative forex effect of -2.0%  reflecting in particular the depreciation of various Asian and Latin American currencies against the euro. Reported sales were also impacted by a positive contribution of hyperinflation of +1.3%  and a slightly negative scope effect of -0.5%.Sales by operating segment€ million except % Q22022 Q22023 Reported change LFL SalesGrowth Volume/Mix Growth H12022 H12023 Reported change LFL SalesGrowth Volume/MixGrowthBY GEOGRAPHICAL ZONE Europe 2 289 2 429 +6.1% +6.5% -5.1% 4 431 4 677 +5.5% +6.4% -4.6% North America 2 1 662 1 704 +2.5% +5.0% -2.7% 3 139 3 418 +8.9% +8.3% -1.0% China  North Asia & Oceania 2 936 954 +1.9% +9.6% +8.8% 1 671 1 778 +6.4% +12.4% +11.2% Latin America 3 704 779 +10.7 +10.8% -2.0% 1 327 1 466 +10.5% +11.7% -1.1% Rest of the World 1 476 1 369 -7.2% +3.9% -4.3% 2 756 2 828 +2.6% +7.7% -2.8%BY CATEGORY EDP 3 684 3 731 +1.3% +6.2% -3.3% 7 062 7 503 +6.3% +7.7% -3.3% Specialized Nutrition 2 106 2 142 +1.7% +4.9% -1.7% 4 029 4 250 +5.5% +8.3% +1.7% Waters 1 277 1 362 +6.6% +9.6% 0.0% 2 234 2 413 +8.0% +10.6% +1.1% TOTAL 7 067 7 235 +2.4% +6.4% -2.3% 13 325 14 167 +6.3% +8.4% -1.1%In the second quarter  Europe sales were up +6.5% on a like-for-like basis  with price up +11.7% and volume/mix down -5.1%.

By category  Specialized Nutrition and Waters registered resilient growth  while EDP made further progress in its portfolio transformation. In North America  sales were up +5.0% on a like-for-like basis  with price up +7.7% and volume/mix down -2.7%. Growth was led by Yogurt  Coffee Creations and Waters  with Oikos  International Delight  Stok and evian growing at a double-digit rate  while Plant-based is lapping a high base of comparison. Specialized Nutrition also lapped the high base of last year driven by the shipments realized in the context of Operation Fly Formula. China  North Asia & Oceania posted sales growth of +9.6% on a like-for-like basis  led by +0.8% growth in price and +8.8% growth in volume/mix. In China  Aptamil continued to deliver solid growth in Infant Nutrition  coupled with further market share gains  while Nutrison and Neocate posted strong growth in Adult Nutrition and Pediatric Specialties respectively. In Waters  Mizone registered mid-teens growth  driven by volumes  with market share gains  while in EDP  Japan delivered another quarter of double-digit growth. Latin America posted sales growth of +10.8% on a like-for-like basis  with a +12.9% increase in price and a -2.0% decline in volume/mix  led by Danonino and Danette in Mexico and by Danone and Yopro in Brazil.

Recurring operating margin stood at 12.2%  up +14 basis points (bps) compared to last year. This increase was mainly driven by the improvement of topline drivers – including volume  mix and price – for a combined estimated impact of c. +630 bps. This positive effect was partially offset by the still strong negative impact of input-cost inflation net of productivity  at c. -540 bps.Besides  Danone continued to step-up its reinvestments in A&P  product superiority and capabilities  that had a negative effect of -99 bps in H1 2023. Finally  Overheads before reinvestments had a positive effect of +7 bps.In addition to operating effects  reported margin also includes the positive impact of Forex and others  changes in scope  and contribution from hyperinflation  as well as the negative effects from other income and expenses  for a total combined effect of +13 bps.Net income and Earnings per shareH1 2022 H1 2023 in millions of euros except if stated otherwise Recurring Non-recurring Total Recurring Non-recurring Total Recurring operating income 1 612 1 612 1 734 1 734 Other operating income and expense (233) (233) (53) (53) Operating income 1 612 (233) 1 380 1 734 (53) 1 681 Cost of net debt (78) (78) (74) (74) Other financial income and expense (69) 6 (63) (67) (15) (83) Income before taxes 1 466 (227) 1 239 1 593 (68) 1 525 Income tax (403) 28 (376) (435) 6 (429) Effective tax rate 27.5% 30.3% 27.3% 28.1% Net income from fully consolidated companies 1 063 (199) 863 1 158 (62) 1 095 Share of profit (loss) of equity-accounted companies 25 (114) (89) 14 19 33 Net income 1 088 (313) 774 1 172 (44) 1 129 • Group share 1 051 (314) 737 1 133 (40) 1 093 • Non-controlling interests 37 0 37 39 (3) 36 EPS (€) 1.63 1.14 1.76 1.70Other operating income and expense reached -€53 million in H1 2023  vs -€233 million in the prior year.

EDP RUSSIA UPDATEOn October 14  2022  Danone launched a process to transfer the control of its EDP (Essential Dairy & Plant-based) Business in Russia  which was progressing according to the expected schedule.On July 16  2023  Danone has taken note of the decision of the Russian authorities aiming at placing Danone Russia (EDP) under the temporary external administration of the Russian Federal Agency for State Property Management (Rosimushchestvo).On July 18  2023  the Russian authorities indicated that the Board of Directors and CEO of Danone Russia (EDP) had been changed. These changes took place without the knowledge of  or approval by  Danone. While Danone no longer retains control of the management of its EDP operations in Russia  it remains their legal owner.As a result  and as per applicable accounting standards (IFRS)  Danone will deconsolidate its EDP Russia operations in July 2023  triggering an approximately €(0.2)bn cash impairment. In addition  Danone recognizes a non-cash RUB / EUR FX translation difference of approximately €(0.5)bn  which has no impact on Group’s total equity. Both will be recognized on December 31  2023.EDP Russia will therefore be taken out of Danone’s like for like perimeter as of July 2023; Danone’s H2 2023 recurring performance will be reported excluding the contribution of EDP Russia.Danone will continue to investigate the situation to understand the implications of the decisions of the Russian authorities on the ongoing EDP operations of Danone in Russia  as well as on the ongoing sale process. Danone will continue to provide information on material developments related to the situation of its EDP operations in Russia and keeps investigating how to protect its assets and its rights as shareholder  with a first priority to ensure people safety.III. 2023 GUIDANCELike-for-like sales growth expected between +4 and +6%  with moderate recurring operating margin improvement.IV.MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS OVER THE PERIODApril 27  2023: At Danone’s 2023 Annual General Meeting  shareholders approved all resolutions submitted to its approval by the Board of Directors  including the distribution of a dividend of €2.00 per share in cash  the appointment of Sanjiv Mehta as Director  the renewals of terms of office of Valérie Chapoulaud-Floquet and Gilles Schnepp  and the ratification of the co-opting of Gilbert Ghostine and Lise Kingo  as Directors.At Danone’s 2023 Annual General Meeting  shareholders approved all resolutions submitted to its approval by the Board of Directors  including the distribution of a dividend of €2.00 per share in cash  the appointment of Sanjiv Mehta as Director  the renewals of terms of office of Valérie Chapoulaud-Floquet and Gilles Schnepp  and the ratification of the co-opting of Gilbert Ghostine and Lise Kingo  as Directors. May15  2023: Danone issued a €800 million bond with an 8-year maturity and a 3.47% coupon. The settlement took place on May 22  2023  and the bonds are listed on Euronext Paris.V. NEW FINANCIAL DISCLOSUREPRO FORMAFinancial disclosureDanone’s external reporting has been adjusted to reflect the organizational changes. Starting from Q1 2023  the company reports its key indicators (net sales  like-for-like sales growth  recurring operating income and recurring operating margin) along five adjusted operating segments:Europe  which includes Ukraine (was previously part of Rest of the World zone);North America  which includes the United States and Canada (unchanged);China  North Asia  Oceania (unchanged);Latin America (was previously part of Rest of the World zone);Rest of the World  which includes AMEA (Asia  Middle East including Turkey  Africa) and CIS.The global category reporting remains unchanged  and Danone continues to report performance  on both net sales and recurring operating income and margin  for EDP  Specialized Nutrition and Waters.Like-For-Like d efinitionAll countries with hyperinflationary economies are now included in our like-for-like changes. However  in order to limit the distorting effect of hyperinflation  net sales growth in excess of around 26% per year are excluded from like-for-like net sales growth calculation in hyperinflationary economies. Indeed  a three-year average at 26% would generally trigger hyperinflation as defined by IFRS rules.H1 and FY 2022 sales restated by new operating segments and new LFL methodologyH1 2022Europe North America China/North Asia/Oceania AMEA  CIS & Latin America Total Net sales (€m) LFL sales growth (%) Net sales (€m) LFL sales growth (%) Net sales (€m) LFL sales growth (%) Net sales (€m) LFL sales growth (%) Net sales (€m) LFL sales growth (%) EDP 2 087 -0.2% 2 851 +6.4% 166 +9.6% 1 958 +7.9% 7 062 +4.7% Specialized Nutrition 1 485 +8.4% 174 +14.0% 1 160 +15.0% 1 209 +6.1% 4 029 +9.7% Waters 859 +11.4% 114 +18.3% 345 -9.9% 916 +14.2% 2 234 +8.8% Total Company 4 431 +4.7% 3 139 +7.2% 1 671 +8.3% 4 083 +8.6% 13 325 +6.9%FY 2022Europe North America China/North Asia/Oceania AMEA  CIS & Latin America Total Net sales (€m) LFL sales growth (%) Net sales (€m) LFL sales growth (%) Net sales (€m) LFL sales growth (%) Net sales (€m) LFL sales growth (%) Net sales (€m) LFL sales growth (%) EDP 4 137 +0.6% 6 085 +8.1% 340 +12.4% 4 237 +8.0% 14 799 +5.8% Specialized Nutrition 2 977 +8.3% 376 +15.6% 2 431 +9.3% 2 535 +9.7% 8 319 +9.3% Waters 1 757 +8.5% 251 +19.0% 656 -4.4% 1 879 +10.2% 4 543 +7.5% Total Company 8 871 +4.6% 6 712 +8.9% 3 428 +6.7% 8 651 +9.0% 27 661 +7.1%H1 and FY 2022 margin restated by new operating segmentsRecurring operating profit (€m)and margin (%)H1 2022 FY 2022 €m Margin (%) €m Margin (%)BY GEOGRAPHICAL ZONE Europe 574 12.9% 1 084 12.2% North America4 254 8.1% 679 10.1% China  North Asia & Oceania2 534 32.0% 1 037 30.2% Latin America 3 -1 -0.1% 55 1.9% Rest of the World 251 9.1% 522 8.9%BY CATEGORY EDP 494 7.0% 1 207 8.2% Specialized Nutrition 933 23.2% 1 799 21.6% Waters 185 8.3% 370 8.2% Total 1 612 12.1% 3 377 12.2%VI. ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES NOT DEFINED BY IFRSIAS29: impact on reported dataAll necessary conditions have been reached (including 3-year cumulative rate of inflation for consumer prices exceeding the 100% threshold reached during the first half 2022) to now consider Turkey as “hyperinflationary” as defined by IFRS rules and therefore that IAS 29 rule related to Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies becomes applicable to the country. Consequently  Danone applies IAS 29 in Turkey with an effective date of January 1st  2022.Adoption of IAS 29 in hyperinflationary countries requires its non-monetary assets and liabilities and its income statement to be restated to reflect the changes in the general pricing power of its functional currency  leading to a gain or loss on the net monetary position included in the net income. Moreover  its financial statements are converted into euros using the closing exchange rate of the relevant period.IAS 29: impact on reported data€ million except % Q2 2023 H1 2023 Sales -17.7 -54.2 Sales growth (%) -0.24% -0.38% Recurring Operating Income -35 Recurring Net Income – Group share -72Breakdown by quarter of H1 202 3 sales after application of IAS 29H1 2023 sales correspond to the addition of:Q2 2023 reported sales;Q1 2023 sales resulting from the application of IAS 29 until June 30  2023  to sales of entities in hyperinflation countries (application of the inflation rate until June 30  2023  and translation into euros using the June 30 2023  closing rate) and provided in the table below for information (unaudited data).€ million Q1 20231 Q2 2023 H1 2023 Europe 2 248 2 429 4 677 North America 1 714 1 704 3 418 China  North Asia & Oceania 824 954 1 778 Latin America 687 779 1 466 Rest of the World 1 459 1 369 2 828 Total 6 932 7 235 14 1671Results from the application of IAS29 until June 30  2023  to Q1 sales of entities of hyperinflation countries.Financial indicators not defined in IFRSDue to rounding  the sum of values presented may differ from totals as reported.

Other operating income and expenses comprise items that  because of their significant or unusual nature  cannot be viewed as inherent to Danone’s recurring activity and have limited predictive value  thus distorting the assessment of its recurring operating performance and its evolution. These mainly include:capital gains and losses on disposals of fully consolidated companies;impairment charges on intangible assets with indefinite useful lives;costs related to strategic restructurings or transformation plans;costs related to major external growth transactions;costs related to major crisis and major litigations;in connection with IFRS 3 (Revised) and IAS 27 (Revised) relating to business combinations  (i) acquisition costs related to business combinations  (ii) revaluation profit or loss accounted for following a loss of control  and (iii) changes in earn-outs relating to business combinations and subsequent to acquisition date.Recurring operating margin is defined as Recurring operating income over Sales ratio.Other non-recurring financial income and expense corresponds to financial income and expense items that  in view of their significant or unusual nature  cannot be considered as inherent to Danone’s recurring financial management. These mainly include changes in value of non-consolidated interests.Non-recurring income tax corresponds to income tax on non-recurring items as well as tax income and expense items that  in view of their significant or unusual nature  cannot be considered as inherent to Danone’s recurring performance.Recurring effective tax rate measures the effective tax rate of Danone’s recurring performance and is computed as the ratio of income tax related to recurring items over recurring net income before tax.Non-recurring share of profit of equity-accounted companies includes items that  because of their significant or unusual nature  cannot be viewed as inherent to the companies' recurring activity and thereby distort the assessment of their recurring performance and trends in that performance. These items mainly relate to (i) capital gains and losses on disposals of investments in equity-accounted companies  (ii) impairment of goodwill  and (iii) non-recurring items  as defined by Danone  included in the share of profit of equity-accounted companies.Recurring net income (or Recurring net income – Group Share) corresponds to the Group share of the consolidated Recurring net income. The Recurring net income excludes items that  because of their significant or unusual nature  cannot be viewed as inherent to Danone’s recurring activity and have limited predictive value  thus distorting the assessment of its recurring performance and its evolution. Such non-recurring income and expenses correspond to Other operating income and expenses  Other non-recurring financial income and expenses  Non-recurring income tax  and Non-recurring income from equity-accounted companies. Such income and expenses  excluded from Net income  represent Non-recurring net income.Recurring EPS (or Recurring net income – Group Share  per share after dilution) is defined as the ratio of Recurring net income adjusted for hybrid financing over Diluted number of shares. In compliance with IFRS  income used to calculate EPS is adjusted for the coupon related to the hybrid financing accrued for the period and presented net of tax.H1 2022 H1 2023 Recurring Total Recurring Total Net income-Group share (€ million) 1 051 737 1 133 1 093 Coupon related to hybrid financing net of tax (€ million) (7) (7) (6) (6) Number of shares • Before dilution 638 514 268 638 514 268 640 196 786 640 196 786 • After dilution 638 827 268 638 827 268 640 804 805 640 804 805 EPS (€) • Before dilution 1.64 1.14 1.76 1.70 • After dilution 1.63 1.14 1.76 1.70Free cash flow represents cash flows provided or used by operating activities less capital expenditure net of disposals and  in connection with IFRS 3 (Revised)  relating to business combinations  excluding (i) acquisition costs related to business combinations  and (ii) earn-outs related to business combinations and paid subsequently to acquisition date.(€ million) H1 2022 H1 2023 Cash-flow from operating activities 970 1 424 Capital expenditure (318) (310) Disposal of tangible assets & transaction fees related to business combinations1 22 10 Free cash-flow 674 1 1241Represents acquisition costs related to business combinations paid during the period.Net financial debt represents the net debt portion bearing interest.

The growth was led by continued strong market conditions in government services and steady trends elsewhere.An eighth of the portfolio (with Consumer Products Services) declined organically  down 3.1%  impacted by continued high inventory levels and fewer new product launches.Solid financial positionAt the end of June 2023  the Group's adjusted net financial debt slightly decreased compared with the level at December 31  2022. The Group has a solid financial structure with most of its maturities beyond 2024.Bureau Veritas had EUR 1.7 billion in available cash and cash equivalents and EUR 600 million in undrawn committed credit lines at June 30  2023. The adjusted net financial debt/EBITDA ratio was further reduced to 0.95x (from 1.10x last year) and the EBITDA/consolidated net financial expense ratio was 26.10x.The average maturity of the Group’s financial debt was 4.2 years  with a blended average cost of funds over the half year of 1.0% (excluding the impact of IFRS 16)  compared with 2.5% in the first half of 2022 and benefitting from the increase in income from cash and cash equivalents.Bureau Veritas shareholders approved the distribution of a dividend for the 2022 financial yearAt the Bureau Veritas Annual Shareholders’ Meeting  shareholders approved the distribution of a dividend of EUR 0.77 per share for the 2022 financial year (3rd resolution  approved at 99.99%)  paid in cash on July 6  2023.2023 NEW OUTLOOKBased on the half-year performance  a healthy sales pipeline and the significant growth opportunities related to Sustainability  Bureau Veritas now expects for full-year 2023 to deliver:mid-to-high single-digit organic revenue growth (up from mid-single-digit organic revenue growth previously);a stable adjusted operating margin at constant exchange rates;strong cash flow  with a cash conversion3 above 90%.BOARD CHANGESOn June 22  2023  following the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting  the Board of Directors decided the following:Laurent Mignon appointed Chairman of the Board of Directors of Bureau VeritasLaurent Mignon was appointed Chairman of the Board.

Participants in these programs were identified as part of Bureau Veritas’ overall approach to evaluating talent and succession planning and this approach was strengthened through more robust processes; Bureau Veritas conducted a survey with its employees on Diversity  Equity & Inclusion to better understand key focus areas for strategies to achieve the Group’s vision of a fully inclusive culture.Awards:Bureau Veritas received several CSR-related awards in the first-half of 2023:the S&P Sustainability Yearbook recognizes companies  grouped by industry  that have demonstrated strong corporate sustainability. This year  Bureau Veritas is in the Top 5% S&P Global ESG Score in the Professional Services industry;Capital magazine in France recognized Bureau Veritas as an “entreprise engagée pour la diversité” (company committed to diversity) for 2023;Bureau Veritas was included in the Financial Times’ list of “Diversity leaders 2023”.ANALYSIS OF THE GROUP'S RESULTS AND FINANCIAL POSITIONRevenue up 7.8% year on year (up 9.4% on an organic basis)Revenue in the first half of 2023 amounted to EUR 2 904.2 million  a 7.8% increase compared with H1 2022.The organic increase was 9.4% compared with H1 2022  of which 10.3% in the second quarter of 2023  benefiting from solid market trends across most businesses and geographies.Four businesses delivered very strong organic growth: Marine & Offshore  up 15.6%  Industry  up 15.5%  Certification  up 11.2%  and Buildings & Infrastructure (B&I)  up 10.8%. Agri-Food & Commodities grew 6.5% organically  led by all segments. Conversely  Consumer Products Services declined 3.1% organically due to fewer new product launches and lower volumes.By geography  the Americas was amongst the best performing region (28% of revenue; up 12.4% organically)  primarily led by a 25.9% increase in South America with a good performance in Brazil and Chile notably. Growth in Europe (35% of revenue; up 8.6% organically) was broad-based across most countries. Business in Asia-Pacific (28% of revenue; up 6.3% organically) benefited from a gradual recovery in China (concentrated in Q2)  while double-digit growth was delivered in Australia. Finally  Africa and the Middle East (9% of revenue) outperformed the Group with organic revenue growth of 14.4%  essentially driven by Buildings & Infrastructure and energy projects in the Middle East.The scope effect was a positive 1.5%  reflecting bolt-on acquisitions realized in the past few quarters.Currency fluctuations had a negative impact of 3.1% (including a negative impact of 4.9% in Q2)  mainly due to the strength of the euro against most currencies.Adjusted operating profit up 5.7% to EUR 434.2millionAdjusted operating profit increased by 5.7% to EUR 434.2 million. First half 2023 adjusted operating margin was organically resilient as the Group managed to deliver broadly the same margin (15.2%) as last year (15.3%) despite inflationary pressures and the mixed performance of Consumer Products Services. Foreign exchange trends were a negative impact of 21bps on the Group’s margin due to the strength of the euro against other currencies  while scope only had a slight negative impact of 2bps.CHANGE IN ADJUSTED OPERATING MARGIN IN PERCENTAGE AND BASIS POINTS H1 2022adjusted operating margin 15.3% Organic change (7)bps Organicadjusted operating margin 15.2% Scope (2)bps Constant currency adjusted operating margin 15.2% Currency (21)bps H1 2023adjusted operating margin 15.0%The organic adjusted operating margin was largely stable with revenue growth and operating leverage delivering higher margins in Marine & Offshore  Industry and Agri-Food & Commodities offsetting lower margins in Consumer Products Services  Buildings & Infrastructure and  to some extent  Certification.Other operating expenses increased to EUR 61.3 million versus EUR 35.7 million in the first half of 2022  and comprised:EUR 21.1 million in amortization of intangible assets resulting from acquisitions (down from EUR 22.0 million in H1 2022);EUR 21.4 million in write-offs of non-current assets mainly related to the Consumer Products Services and Agri-Food & Commodities businesses;EUR 18.6 million in restructuring costs  relating chiefly to Consumer Products Services  Buildings & Infrastructure and commodities-related activities (EUR 8.9 million in H1 2022);EUR 0.2 million in net losses on disposals and acquisitions (net loss of EUR 1.1 million in H1 2022).Operating profit totaled EUR 372.9 million  broadly stable versus EUR 375.2 million in the first half of 2022.Adjusted EPS of EUR 0.61  up 11.1% year on yearNet financial expense amounted to EUR 15.2 million in the first half of 2023  compared with EUR 29.5 million in the same period one year earlier.The decrease in net finance costs to EUR 24.6 million in H1 2023 (compared with EUR 38.9 million in H1 2022) is mainly attributable to the impact of the increase in income from cash and cash equivalents.The Group posted foreign exchange gains of EUR 14.2 million in H1 2023 owing to the appreciation of the US dollar and the euro against most emerging market currencies (stable vs. H1 2022).The interest cost on pension plans amounted to a negative EUR 1.5 million in H1 2023 compared with a positive EUR 0.8 million in H1 2022.Consolidated income tax expense stood at EUR 113.2 million for H1 2023  compared with EUR 111.1 million for H1 2022.This represents an effective tax rate (ETR) of 31.6% for the period  versus a 32.1% in H1 2022.The adjusted effective tax rate decreased by 0.6 percentage points compared to H1 2022  to 30.7%. It corresponds to the effective tax rate adjusted for the tax effect of adjustment items. The decrease is mainly due to the reduction in dividend distributions from countries subject to withholding tax during the period.Attributable net profit for the period was EUR 232.5 million  versus EUR 225.2 million in H1 2022.Earnings per share (EPS) was EUR 0.51  compared with EUR 0.50 in H1 2022.Adjusted attributable net profit totaled EUR 276.3 million  up 11.1% versus EUR 248.6 million in H1 2022.Adjusted EPS stood at EUR 0.61  a 11.1% increase versus H1 2022 (EUR 0.55 per share).Solid Free cash flow at EUR131.9millionHalf-year 2023 operating cash flow increased by 4.3% to EUR 222.1 million versus EUR 213.0 million in H1 2022. The increase in profit before tax was largely offset by a working capital requirement outflow of EUR 196.2 million  compared to a EUR 176.7 million outflow in the previous year. The change is explained by the strong growth delivered in the second quarter (up 10.3% organically).Working capital requirement (WCR) stood at EUR 517.6 million at June 30  2023  compared withEUR 517.2 million at June 30  2022. As a percentage of revenue  WCR decreased by 100 basis points to 8.8%  compared to 9.8% in H1 2022.Purchases of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets  net of disposals (Net Capex)  amounted to EUR 76.4 million in the first half of 2023  up 46.9% compared to the H1 2022 figure of EUR 52.0 million. The Group’s net capex-to-revenue ratio increased to 2.6% in order to finance growth in its laboratory activities. It was up 70 basis points from the low H1 2022 (1.9%).Free cash flow (operating cash flow after tax  interest expenses and capex) wasEUR 131.9 million  compared to EUR 129.9 million in H1 2022  up 1.5% year on year.

The decrease in adjusted net financial debt of EUR 44.5 million versusDecember 31  2022 (EUR 975.3 million) reflects:free cash flow of EUR 131.9 million;dividend payments totaling EUR 13.3 million corresponding mainly to dividends paid tonon-controlling interests and withholding taxes on intra-group dividends;acquisitions (net) and repayment of amounts owed to shareholders  accounting for EUR 14.2 million;lease payments (related to the application of IFRS 16)  accounting for EUR 63.9 million;other items that decreased the Group's debt by EUR 4.0 million.H1 2023 BUSINESS REVIEWMARINE & OFFSHOREIN EUR MILLIONS H1 2023 H1 2022 CHANGE ORGANIC SCOPE CURRENCY Revenue 228.6 204.5 +11.8% +15.6% - (3.8)% Adjusted Operating Profit 56.5 50.1 +12.7% Adjusted Operating Margin 24.7%% 24.5% +22bps +113bps - (91)bpsThe Marine & Offshore business delivered very strong 15.6% organic revenue growth in the first half of 2023 (including 17.7% in Q2)  led by all geographies and activities:Double-digit organic revenue growth in New Construction (39% of divisional revenue)  reflecting a solid backlog with the conversion of new orders accelerating in Q1 and Q2.(39% of divisional revenue)  reflecting a solid backlog with the conversion of new orders accelerating in Q1 and Q2. Double-digit organic revenue growth in the Core In-service activity (46% of divisional revenue)  which benefitted from a continuing high level of occasional surveys  combined with price increases and the growth of the classified fleet. In the second half  the Group expects slower growth in percentage terms as compared to an exceptionally strong H2 2022 (catch-up effect post lockdowns in China and one-off regulatory benefits in Q4 2022). At June 30  2023  the fleet classified by Bureau Veritas comprised 11 577 ships  representing 146.5 million of Gross Register Tonnage (GRT).activity (46% of divisional revenue)  which benefitted from a continuing high level of occasional surveys  combined with price increases and the growth of the classified fleet. In the second half  the Group expects slower growth in percentage terms as compared to an exceptionally strong H2 2022 (catch-up effect post lockdowns in China and one-off regulatory benefits in Q4 2022). At June 30  2023  the fleet classified by Bureau Veritas comprised 11 577 ships  representing 146.5 million of Gross Register Tonnage (GRT). Double-digit organic revenue growth for Services (15% of divisional revenue  including Offshore) was driven by a combination of strong commercial development for non-classification services  including consulting services related to energy efficiency.Bureau Veritas new orders reached 4.3 million gross tons at June 30  2023  bringing the order book to 20.4 million gross tons at the end of the semester  up 13.3% compared to 18.0 million gross tons at end-June 2022. It is composed of LNG fueled ships  container ships and specialized vessels.The division continued to benefit from its market leader positioning on alternative fuels  mainly LNG and methanol dual propulsion.Marine & Offshore continued to focus on efficiency levers through digitalization and high added-value services. In April 2023  Bureau Veritas and Kongsberg launched a digitally optimized machinery maintenance platform that enables its Machinery Maintenance Application (MMA) to connect directly to a vessel operator’s own maintenance management system  K-Fleet from Kongsberg Digital (more information by clicking here).Adjusted operating margin for the half year improved by 22 basis points to 24.7% on a reported basis compared to H1 2022  negatively impacted by foreign exchange effects (91 basis points). Organically  it rose by 113 basis points  benefiting from operating leverage  a positive mix and operational excellence.Sustainability achievementsThe Group continues to innovate on future fuels and new propulsion systems. In the second quarter of 2023  it has issued an Approval in Principle (AIP) to Rotoboost’s thermocatalytic decomposition process for carbon capture. Rotoboost’s technology converts natural gas into hydrogen and solid carbon using a liquid catalyst. The hydrogen can be used for fuel cells or as blend-in fuel for combustion engines or gas fired boilers.The Group has also been working on ship financing aligned with maritime’s decarbonization goals. It has developed a tool to build realistic decarbonization trajectories for shipping based on a bottom-up methodology. It also supported a pool of banks in the definition of their own strategies related to decarbonization.AGRI-FOOD & COMMODITIESIN EUR MILLIONS H1 2023 H1 2022 CHANGE ORGANIC SCOPE CURRENCY Revenue 611.6 588.0 +4.0% +6.5% - (2.5)% Adjusted Operating Profit 82.3 76.2 +8.0% Adjusted Operating Margin 13.5% 13.0% +50bps +66bps - (16)bpsThe Agri-Food & Commodities business delivered organic revenue growth of 6.5% in the first half of 2023  with positive trends for all activities. In Q2  Group organic revenue increased by 5.4%.Oil & Petrochemicals (O&P  30% of divisional revenue) achieved mid-single digit organic revenue growth overall. Steady growth was recorded for the O&P Trade market  driven by higher volumes and pricing initiatives. Particularly strong growth was achieved in Europe  led by market share gains in key locations and increased activity (Belgium  Greece). Throughout the first half  non-trade related services and value-added segments such as Verifuel bunker quantity services and sustainability-driven solutions continued to expand across O&P. The Group is gaining momentum with its new initiatives for biofuels and OCM (Oil Condition Monitoring)  which both grew high double digits organically.Metals & Minerals (M&M  33% of divisional revenue) grew mid-single digits on an organic basis. The Upstream business (nearly two-thirds of M&M) showed solid growth (up 3.1% organically). The Group continued to benefit from the success of its on-site laboratories’ strategy with several important wins in the period (including an iron ore mine in Australia and a copper mine in Chile). In mining related testing  the activity continued to be driven by a mix of gold  energy transition metals and bulk minerals. Trade activities recorded double-digit organic revenue growth (up 10.3% organically). This was fueled by all the main commodities  with strong trade volumes in Asia  the Middle East and Southern Africa as well as by pricing initiatives.Agri-Food (22% of divisional revenue) achieved high-single digits organic growth in the first half  led by Agricultural products. Agricultural inspection activities grew strongly  benefiting from solid trends in Europe and notably in the entire Danube corridor triggered by the changes of routes. Activity in the Middle East was particularly strong following the opening of a new laboratory and good sales performance. The Food business grew mid-single digits organically  with improvement achieved in the second quarter. Inspection activities delivered stronger growth than testing activities  benefiting notably from a favorable regulatory environment for traceability services in Europe (EU Deforestation Regulation  German Supply Chain Act). Growth was delivered in the Group’s largest hubs  with Australia benefiting from its continued diversification. New geographies also contributed to growth  including the US (driven by the ramp-up of new greenfield lab openings) and Southeast Asian countries (large government contract on food safety).Government services (15% of divisional revenue) recorded high single-digit organic revenue growth in the first half. Strong growth was delivered in Asia  the Middle East and Africa led by a solid commercial development of VOC (Verification of Conformity) contracts and Single Window contracts in Africa and Central Asia.The adjusted operating margin for the Agri-Food & Commodities business rose to 13.5%  up 50 basis points compared to last year. This was led by a topline recovery and a positive business mix.Sustainability achievementsBureau Veritas was awarded a contract to deliver services for biofuels from a large waste-based biofuels producer including sampling and analyses for Fatty Acid Methyl Ester (FAME) products in the Netherlands.In the first half of 2023  the Group was awarded a Food Safety and Quality Control contract in the Middle East to support regional farmers and producers to comply with the standards and regulations demand of a new sustainable city.INDUSTRYIN EUR MILLIONS H1 2023 H1 2022 CHANGE ORGANIC SCOPE CURRENCY Revenue 618.3 562.4 +9.9% +15.5% - (5.6)% Adjusted Operating Profit 76.1 62.2 +22.4% Adjusted Operating Margin 12.3% 11.0% +125bps +147bps - (22)bpsIndustry was among the best performing businesses within the Group’s portfolio in the first half of 2023 with organic growth of 15.5%  including 18.2% growth in the second quarter.All segments and most geographies contributed to the divisional growth  with both Latin America and Africa outperforming. Energy transition  which accelerated over the period  remained a key catalyst overall and triggered clean energy investment and decarbonation solutions which benefited the division.By market  Power & Utilities (15% of divisional revenue) continued to be a key driver of growth for the portfolio with a double-digit organic performance for both Opex and Capex activities during the half year (including Q2). Growth was driven mainly by Latin America thanks to the ramp-up of contract wins with various Power Distribution clients  although the Group is more selective on contracts profitability. In Europe  the nuclear power generation segment contributed greatly to growth  notably in the UK. There are promising opportunities in the medium term for new nuclear power plants (new EPRs in France and development of Small Modular Reactors (SMR) projects in several countries) alongside dismantling projects (such as Ignalinia in Lithuania).Renewable Power Generation activities (solar  wind  hydrogen) maintained strong momentum during the period  with a high double-digit organic performance delivered across most geographies. A strong path of growth was recorded in the US  with a very dynamic performance from Bureau Veritas’ Bradley Construction Management for solar  onshore wind and high-voltage transmission projects. This benefited from easing supply chain restrictions and early opportunities from Inflation Reduction Act investment expectations. The Group is seeing increased demand and activity in both Carbon capture and Sequestration (CCS)  notably in the US where it continues to innovate.In Oil & Gas (33% of divisional revenue)  double digit organic revenue growth was achieved in the first half. The two-thirds of the business related to Opex services increased 19.7% as they continue to benefit from the conversion of a solid sales pipeline. Capex-related activities  including Procurement Services  grew low double digits organically  essentially attributable to the startup of new projects in the gas sector. This was triggered by companies’ willingness to manage their assets in a more sustainable manner (low carbon strategy towards net zero target). Large contracts ramped up in the US  Asia  Middle East and Latin America  in Brazil in particular.Elsewhere  the Automotive business (5% of divisional revenue) delivered high single-digit growth amid easing in supply chain disruptions. In July 2023  the Group sold its non-core automotive inspection business in the US  representing below EUR 20 million of annualized revenue. This is part of the Group’s active portfolio management.Adjusted operating margin for the half year increased by 125 basis points to 12.3%. This is attributable to operational leverage through the ramp-up of contracts and more selectivity when it comes to profitability.Sustainability achievementsIn Q2 2023  Bureau Veritas was awarded a major contract to provide Integrated Site Services (including the quality control of the construction works) for Scottish Power Renewables’ East Anglia THREE – one of the UK’s largest offshore windfarm projects. Once complete  it will generate up to 1 400MW of power via 95 wind turbines and power over one million homes in the UK.In the first half  the Group was also awarded contracts with five utilities companies in California (United States)  to act as an independent evaluator for Wildfire Mitigation program through audit and field inspection services. These programs are required by the Public Utilities Commission to reduce the probability for wildfires due to drier conditions associated with climate change.BUILDINGS & INFRASTRUCTUREIN EUR MILLIONS H1 2023 H1 2022 CHANGE ORGANIC SCOPE CURRENCY Revenue 868.8 777.8 +11.7% +10.8% +2.3% (1.4)% Adjusted Operating Profit 106.4 103.9 +2.4% Adjusted Operating Margin 12.2% 13.4% (111)bps (134)bps +21bps +2bpsThe Buildings & Infrastructure (B&I) business achieved strong organic growth of 10.8% in the first half of 2023  primarily fueled by the Asia-Pacific and by the Middle East regions. In Q2  revenue grew 12.4% on an organic basis thanks to double-digit performances in both CAPEX and OPEX activities. Construction-related activities (55% of divisional revenue) benefited from strong dynamics for new projects in South America (notably Brazil) and the Middle East.The Americas (27% of divisional revenue) posted high-single-digit organic growth. In Latin America  a strong performance was achieved thanks to the ongoing ramp-up of large Capex contracts for project management assistance signed in the second half of 2022  mostly focused on the energy and aluminum fields. Low single-digit H1 2023 growth was recorded in Northern America led by the datacenter commissioning market and the resilience of the code compliance activity. Some of the Capex business growth was moderated by longer decision processes and a slowdown in the commercial real estate activities on the back of rising interest rates. The pipeline remains very solid. Opex activities delivered good growth thanks to the sustained momentum on non-regulatory new services  primarily commissioned by insurance companies.In Europe (50% of divisional revenue)  strong growth was delivered on the back of a double-digit performance in Italy  Spain and the UK thanks to more stringent regulation benefiting both Opex and Capex activities. France  the region’s largest contributor (with 39% of divisional revenue)  delivered mid- to-high organic revenue growth in H1 2023. This was once again driven by a further good performance in In-service activity backed by a solid pipeline (notably in white certificate project services and inspections)  and good pricing power on mass market activity. The growth of Capex-related activities remained muted despite a good backlog and the higher weighting towards infrastructure and public works versus residential building. The pipeline of sales related to the EU Green Deal and the upcoming 2024 Olympic Games in France continued to grow with opportunities mainly focused on energy efficiency programs.The Asia-Pacific  and the Middle East & Africa regions (23% of divisional revenue) are the best-performing areas  recording a double-digit organic revenue increase in H1 2023 (and in Q2). Asia is pushed by stellar performances in India and Southeastern Asia. The Chinese activity is steadily picking up. In the Middle East region  the Group continued to deliver very high growth primarily led by the roll-out of new services linked to the development of numerous projects. As an illustration  in Saudi Arabia  the Group remained strongly engaged in delivering QA/QC Services for the NEOM project  a smart city that will be powered by renewable energy and become a center for biotechnology  media and entertainment.Adjusted operating margin for the half year declined by 111 basis points to 12.2% from 13.4% in the prior year. This was primarily attributed to unfavorable comparable following a positive one-off in social liabilities in France in H1 2022 that has mostly reversed in H2 last year.Sustainability achievementsIn the second quarter of 2023  the Group was awarded several contracts in the field of energy audits  to help clients across different industries (construction  banks  transports) to comply with the Tertiary Decree imposing energy consumption reduction commitments in the French tertiary sector.CERTIFICATIONIN EUR MILLIONS H1 2023 H1 2022 CHANGE ORGANIC SCOPE CURRENCY Revenue 227.8 209.2 +8.9% +11.2% - (2.3)% Adjusted Operating Profit 41.7 40.0 +4.3% Adjusted Operating Margin 18.3% 19.1% (80)bps (63)bps - (17)bpsThe Certification business delivered strong organic growth of 11.2% in the first half of 2023 (similar in the first and second quarters). This good performance was enhanced by the acceleration of the diversification of the Group’s portfolio. Strong commercial development and solid price increases also supported growth over the period  mostly led by very good traction in South America and Asia-Pacific  where the offering has been expanded with new schemes (with the shift from traditional QHSE schemes towards new services). This is illustrated by the sustained good performance in countries such as Brazil  Vietnam and India  on the back of good momentum for CSR-driven solutions and customized audits.Double-digit growth was recorded for QHSE schemes  Supply Chain and Food Certification (led by Food Safety)  with a strong momentum for Sustainability-related solutions. Momentum was particularly strong on certifications dedicated to companies for anti-bribery  IT service management  information security and business continuity. Similarly to Q1 2023  Cybersecurity solutions also posted stellar performances. This is due to rising demand for more control on security systems. In the United Arab Emirates  Bureau Veritas recently won an important contract to provide cybersecurity and penetration testing services on behalf of an energy company.Sustainability-driven solutions are in high demand as the search for more brand protection  data transparency  and social responsibility commitments all along the supply chain drove a 17.3% organic growth performance. It reflected a high demand for verification of greenhouse gas emissions and supply chain audits on ESG topics.The adjusted operating margin for the half year was a very healthy 18.3%  compared to 19.1% in the prior year. This reflects a 80-basis-point decrease against the record level  attributed to negative forex and mix effects.Sustainability achievementsIn the second quarter of 2023  Bureau Veritas partnered with Enhesa  a global regulatory and sustainability intelligence provider in the UK  the Netherlands and Belgium. Based on legal requirements identified through the Enhesa solution  Bureau Veritas will provide end-to-end regulatory compliance and services for organizations in these countries seeking to implement  measure and achieve their ESG  HSE and Sustainability requirements objectives.During the first half of 2023  Bureau Veritas was awarded numerous contracts in the Sustainability field. For instance  the Group won a contract to help Valeo produce wiper blades designed to reduce CO 2 emissions by 61% compared to a standard product commercialized in the European market.Bureau Veritas also signed agreements with three major datacenter companies based in Denmark to assess and verify their compliance with the Self-Regulatory Initiative (SRI) as part of the Climate Neutral Data Centre Pact (CNDCP).CONSUMER PRODUCTSIN EUR MILLIONS H1 2023 H1 2022 CHANGE ORGANIC SCOPE CURRENCY Revenue 349.1 351.5 (0.7)% (3.1)% +6.0% (3.6)% Adjusted Operating Profit 71.2 78.5 (9.3)% Adjusted Operating Margin 20.4% 22.3% (195)bps (67)bps (95)bps (33)bpsThe Consumer Products division posted a decline of 3.1% in organic revenue over the first half of 2023 (including a decline of 2.7% in the second quarter)  with varying geographical and service trends.During the period  Asia remained the region the most impacted by the global economic slowdown  while the Americas (especially Latin America) and the Middle East & Africa (led by Turkey) continue to benefit from the diversification strategy implemented over the last years and from the structural near-shoring market trends.Softlines  Hardlines & Toys (49% of divisional revenue) saw a mid-single-digit organic decrease in the first half of 2023  due to lower volumes and the resulting high inventory levels  even though the activity improved a bit in the second quarter. Softlines showed mixed performances by country: as expected  China delivered a weak performance  while contrasting dynamics were observed between Southeast and South Asian countries (Bangladesh  Pakistan  and Sri Lanka) which benefited from the continuing structural sourcing shift outside of China. Similarly  Turkey saw a strong increase in testing volumes as it continued to benefit from nearshoring shifts by European retailers. This supports the Group’s geographic diversification strategy towards new production countries that are closer to the countries of consumption.Health  Beauty & Household (8% of divisional revenue) recorded solid double-digit organic growth in H1  led by Asia and the US. South Korea benefited from its diversification into Cosmetics  Health & Beauty while Italy remained fueled by luxury and leather products. The integration of Advanced Testing Laboratory (ATL) and Galbraith Laboratories Inc.  which were both acquired last year in the US  progressed well with a promising sales pipeline. These acquisitions help Bureau Veritas strengthen its position in this growing sector.Inspection and Audit services (12% of divisional revenue) maintained their growth momentum thanks to strong growth for Sustainability services over the course of the first half of 2023: this includes organic  recycling  social audits and green claim verification across most geographies.Lastly  Technology8 (31% of divisional revenue) performed below the divisional average  still affected by the global decrease in demand for electrical and wireless equipment as well as the resulting temporary reduction in new product launches. The New Mobility sub-segment delivered double-digit growth  led by both China and the US  areas where the Group invested significantly  and which benefited from the ramp-up of new laboratories. This reflected good traction on testing on electric vehicle engines  dashboards or charging stations. In the first half of 2023  the Group continued to pursue its geographical diversification strategy to take advantage of the structural sourcing shifts currently unfolding in South and Southeast Asia. In this respect  in the first quarter  Bureau Veritas opened a new lab in Hanoi which will be fully dedicated to connectivity and wireless testing.Adjusted operating margin for the half year declined by 195 basis points to 20.4% from 22.3% in the prior year. This was primarily attributed to the decline in revenue and negative scope and forex effects. The benefits of several cost initiatives are expected to be felt in the second half of the year.Sustainability achievementsIn the first half of 2023  the Group was awarded a contract with a large American sportswear company to perform regulatory audits and Sustainability services (Energy Efficiency Directive  Energy Performance of Building Directive) across 40 countries where the brand is commercialized; through these services  Bureau Veritas supports its client in managing its ESG strategy and providing proof of its commitments.PRESENTATION H1 2023 results will be presented on Wednesday  July 26  2023  at 3:00 p.m. (Paris time) A video conference will be webcast live.

Adjusted net financialdebt 930.8 975.3APPENDIX 7: DEFINITION OF ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE INDICATORS AND RECONCILIATION WITH IFRSThe management process used by Bureau Veritas is based on a series of alternative performance indicators  as presented below. These indicators were defined for the purposes of preparing the Group’s budgets and internal and external reporting. Bureau Veritas considers that these indicators provide additional useful information to financial statement users  enabling them to better understand the Group’s performance  especially its operating performance. Some of these indicators represent benchmarks in the testing  inspection and certification (“TIC”) business and are commonly used and tracked by the financial community. These alternative performance indicators should be seen as a complement to IFRS-compliant indicators and the resulting changes.GROWTHTotal revenue growthThe total revenue growth percentage measures changes in consolidated revenue between the previous year and the current year. Total revenue growth has three components:organic growth;impact of changes in the scope of consolidation (scope effect);impact of changes in exchange rates (currency effect).Organic growthThe Group internally monitors and publishes “organic” revenue growth  which it considers to be more representative of the Group’s operating performance in each of its business sectors.The main measure used to manage and track consolidated revenue growth is like-for-like  or organic growth. Determining organic growth enables the Group to monitor trends in its business excluding the impact of currency fluctuations  which are outside of Bureau Veritas’ control  as well as scope effects  which concern new businesses or businesses that no longer form part of the business portfolio. Organic growth is used to monitor the Group’s performance internally.Bureau Veritas considers that organic growth provides management and investors with a more comprehensive understanding of its underlying operating performance and current business trends  excluding the impact of acquisitions  divestments (outright divestments as well as the unplanned suspension of operations – in the event of international sanctions  for example) and changes in exchange rates for businesses exposed to foreign exchange volatility  which can mask underlying trends.The Group also considers that separately presenting organic revenue generated by its businesses provides management and investors with useful information on trends in its industrial businesses  and enables a more direct comparison with other companies in its industry.Organic revenue growth represents the percentage of revenue growth  presented at Group level and for each business  based on constant scope of consolidation and exchange rates over comparable periods:constant scope of consolidation: data are restated for the impact of changes in the scope of consolidation over a 12-month period;constant exchange rates: data for the current year are restated using exchange rates for the previous year.Scope effectTo establish a meaningful comparison between reporting periods  the impact of changes in the scope of consolidation is determined:for acquisitions carried out in the current year: by deducting from revenue for the current year revenue generated by the acquired businesses in the current year;for acquisitions carried out in the previous year: by deducting from revenue for the current year revenue generated by the acquired businesses in the months in the previous year in which they were not consolidated;for disposals and divestments carried out in the current year: by deducting from revenue for the previous year revenue generated by the disposed and divested businesses in the previous year in the months of the current year in which they were not part of the Group;for disposals and divestments carried out in the previous year: by deducting from revenue for the previous year revenue generated by the disposed and divested businesses in the previous year prior to their disposal/divestment.Currency effectThe currency effect is calculated by translating revenue for the current year at the exchange rates for the previous year.ADJUSTED OPERATING PROFIT AND ADJUSTED OPERATING MARGINAdjusted operating profit and adjusted operating margin are key indicators used to measure the performance of the business  excluding material items that cannot be considered inherent to the Group’s underlying intrinsic performance owing to their nature. Bureau Veritas considers that these indicators  presented at Group level and for each business  are more representative of the operating performance in its industry.Adjusted operating profitAdjusted operating profit represents operating profit prior to adjustments for the following:amortization of intangible assets resulting from acquisitions;impairment of goodwill;impairment and retirement of non-current assets;gains and losses on disposals of businesses and other income and expenses relating to acquisitions (fees and costs on acquisitions of businesses  contingent consideration on acquisitions of businesses);restructuring costs.When an acquisition is carried out during the financial year  the amortization of the related intangible assets is calculated on a time proportion basis.Since a measurement period of 12 months is allowed for determining the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities  amortization of intangible assets in the year of acquisition may  in some cases  be based on a temporary measurement and be subject to minor adjustments in the subsequent reporting period  once the definitive value of the intangible assets is known.Organic adjusted operating profit represents operating profit adjusted for scope and currency effects over comparable periods:at constant scope of consolidation: data are restated based on a 12-month period;at constant exchange rates: data for the current year are restated using exchange rates for the previous year.The scope and currency effects are calculated using a similar approach to that used for revenue for each component of operating profit and adjusted operating profit.Adjusted operating marginAdjusted operating margin expressed as a percentage represents adjusted operating profit divided by revenue. Adjusted operating margin can be presented on an organic basis or at constant exchange rates  thereby  in the latter case  providing a view of the Group’s performance excluding the impact of currency fluctuations  which are outside of Bureau Veritas’ control.ADJUSTED EFFECTIVE TAX RATEThe effective tax rate (ETR) represents income tax expense divided by the amount of pre-tax profit.The adjusted effective tax rate (adjusted ETR) represents income tax expense adjusted for the tax effect on adjustment items divided by pre-tax profit before taking into account the adjustment items (see adjusted operating profit definition).ADJUSTED NET PROFITAdjusted attributable net profitAdjusted attributable net profit is defined as attributable net profit adjusted for adjustment items (see adjusted operating profit definition) and for the tax effect on adjustment items. Adjusted attributable net profit excludes non-controlling interests in adjustment items and only concerns continuing operations.Adjusted attributable net profit can be presented at constant exchange rates  thereby providing a view of the Group’s performance excluding the impact of currency fluctuations  which are outside of Bureau Veritas’ control. The currency effect is calculated by translating the various income statement items for the current year at the exchange rates for the previous year.Adjusted attributable net profit per shareAdjusted attributable net profit per share (adjusted EPS or earnings per share) is defined as adjusted attributable net profit divided by the weighted average number of shares in the period.FREE CASH FLOWFree cash flow represents net cash generated from operating activities (operating cash flow)  adjusted for the following items:purchases of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets;proceeds from disposals of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets;interest paid.Net cash generated from operating activities is shown after income tax paid.Organic free cash flow represents free cash flow at constant scope and exchange rates over comparable periods:at constant scope of consolidation: data are restated based on a 12-month period;at constant exchange rates: data for the current year are restated using exchange rates for the previous year.The scope and currency effects are calculated using a similar approach to that used for revenue for each component of net cash generated from operating activities and free cash flow.FINANCIAL DEBTGross debtGross debt (or gross finance costs/financial debt) represents bank loans and borrowings plus bank overdrafts.Net debtNet debt (or net finance costs/financial debt) as defined and used by the Group represents gross debt less cash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents comprise marketable securities and similar receivables as well as cash at bank and on hand.Adjusted net debtAdjusted net debt (or adjusted net finance costs/financial debt) as defined and used by the Group represents net debt taking into account currency and interest rate hedging instruments.CONSOLIDATED EBITDAConsolidated EBITDA represents net profit before interest  tax  depreciation  amortization and provisions  adjusted for any entities acquired over the last 12 months. Consolidated EBITDA is used by the Group to track its bank covenants.1 Alternative performance indicators are presented  defined and reconciled with IFRS in appendices 6 and 8 of this press release.2 Net cash generated from operating activities/Adjusted Operating Profit.3 Net cash generated from operating activities/Adjusted Operating Profit.4 TAR: Total Accident Rate (number of accidents with and without lost time x 200 000/number of hours worked).5 Proportion of women on the Executive Committee in Band II (internal grade corresponding to an executive management position) in the Group (number of women on a full-time equivalent basis in a leadership position/total number of full-time equivalents in leadership positions).6 Indicator calculated over a 6-month period compared to a 12-month period for FY 2022 and 2025 target values.7 Greenhouse gas emissions from offices and laboratories  12 months trailing tons of CO 2 equivalent per employee and per year for Scopes 1  2 and 3 (emissions related to business travel).8 The Technology segment comprises Electrical & Electronics  Wireless testing activities and Automotive connectivity testing activities.Attachment,neutral,0.17,0.81,0.02,mixed,0.68,0.23,0.09,True,English,"['higher organic revenue growth', 'BUREAU VERITAS', 'Strong H1', 'financial performance', 'operating', 'full-year', 'high single-digit organic revenue growth', 'higher organic revenue growth', 'mid-single-digit organic revenue growth', 'double-digit organic revenue growth', 'Science Based Targets initiative', 'fewer new product launches', 'main consolidated financial items', 'strong organic revenue growth', 'Bureau Veritas GHG emissions', 'stable adjusted operating margin', 'high inventory levels', 'strong topline growth', 'CONSTANT CURRENCY Revenue', 'significant growth opportunities', 'strong market conditions', 'strong cash flow', 'working capital requirement', 'BV Green Line', 'constant exchange rates', 'Chief Executive Officer', 'global geographical footprint', 'worldwide leadership position', 'supply chain evolution', 'topline growth outlook', 'strong decarbonization trends', 'Free cash flow', 'net debt/EBITDA ratio', 'solid financial structure', 'Solid financial position', 'Alternative performance indicators', 'net financial debt', 'solid underlying trends', 'resilient margin performance', 'Consumer Products Services', 'Attributable net profit', 'healthy sales pipeline', 'Strong H1 2023 operating', 'energy transition solutions', 'energy transition services', '2023 New Outlook', 'Group revenue', 'financial performance', 'term) targets', 'cash conversion2', 'solid demand', 'financial statements', 'FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS', 'operating profit', 'overall trends', 'steady trends', 'half-year performance', 'excellent performance', 'Operating cash-flow', 'PRESS RELEASE', 'Key Figures1', 'first half', 'second quarter', 'mix effects', 'vast majority', 'Middle East', 'Asia Pacific', 'good momentum', 'Maintained traction', 'Group sales', '2025 CSR ambitions', 'Hinda Gharbi', 'full engagement', 'coming months', 'thought leader', 'customer centricity', 'next chapter', 'rising demand', 'ESG-driven services', 'government services', 'H1 2023 Highlights', 'most businesses', 'entire portfolio', 'growing portfolio', 'year variances', 'Seine', 'France', 'July', 'full-year', 'forex', 'share', 'EUR', 'capex', 'context', 'Q2', 'June', 'geographies', 'Americas', 'Africa', 'Sustainability', 'SBTi', 'teams', 'strength', 'diversified', 'activities', 'confidence', 'bellwether', 'sector', 'society', 'innovation', 'core', 'history', 'Board', 'Directors', 'MILLIONS', 'EPS', 'IFRS', 'appendices', 'Two-thirds', 'Marine', 'Offshore', 'Industry', 'Buildings', 'Infrastructure', 'Certification', 'Renewables', 'Agri-Food', 'Commodities']",2023-07-26,2023-07-27,marketscreener.com

The main consolidated financial items are:IN EUR MILLIONS H1 2023 H1 2022 CHANGE CONSTANT CURRENCY Revenue 2 904.2 2 693.4 +7.8% +10.9% Adjusted operating profit(a) 434.2 410.9 +5.7% +10.2% Adjusted operating margin(a) 15.0% 15.3% (30)bps (9)bps Operating profit 372.9 375.2 (0.6)% +4.1% Adjusted net profit(a) 276.3 248.6 +11.1% +16.9% Attributable net profit 232.5 225.2 +3.2% +9.2% Adjusted EPS(a) 0.61 0.55 +11.1% +16.9% EPS 0.51 0.50 +3.2% +9.1% Operating cash-flow 222.1 213.0 +4.3% +7.1% Free cash flow(a) 131.9 129.9 +1.5% +5.1% Adjusted net financial debt(a) 930.8 1 088.8 (14.5)% (a) Alternative performance indicators are presented  defined and reconciled with IFRS in appendices 6 and 8 of this press releaseH1 2023 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTSStrong organic revenue growth in the first half  driven by solid demand and Sustainability and energy transition servicesGroup revenue in the first half of 2023 increased by 9.4% organically compared to the first half of 2022  including 10.3% in the second quarter  benefiting from solid underlying trends across most businesses.This is reflected as follows by business:Two-thirds of the portfolio (Marine & Offshore  Industry  Buildings & Infrastructure and Certification) delivered double-digit organic revenue growth in the first half  benefiting from strong decarbonization trends (Marine & Offshore  and Buildings & Infrastructure notably)  energy transition (led by Renewables) and the rising demand for Sustainability and ESG-driven services (for Certification notably).Another fifth of the portfolio (with Agri-Food & Commodities) delivered mid-to-high single-digit organic revenue growth (up 6.5%). The growth was led by continued strong market conditions in government services and steady trends elsewhere.An eighth of the portfolio (with Consumer Products Services) declined organically  down 3.1%  impacted by continued high inventory levels and fewer new product launches.Solid financial positionAt the end of June 2023  the Group's adjusted net financial debt slightly decreased compared with the level at December 31  2022. The Group has a solid financial structure with most of its maturities beyond 2024.Bureau Veritas had EUR 1.7 billion in available cash and cash equivalents and EUR 600 million in undrawn committed credit lines at June 30  2023. The adjusted net financial debt/EBITDA ratio was further reduced to 0.95x (from 1.10x last year) and the EBITDA/consolidated net financial expense ratio was 26.10x.The average maturity of the Group’s financial debt was 4.2 years  with a blended average cost of funds over the half year of 1.0% (excluding the impact of IFRS 16)  compared with 2.5% in the first half of 2022 and benefitting from the increase in income from cash and cash equivalents.Bureau Veritas shareholders approved the distribution of a dividend for the 2022 financial yearAt the Bureau Veritas Annual Shareholders’ Meeting  shareholders approved the distribution of a dividend of EUR 0.77 per share for the 2022 financial year (3rd resolution  approved at 99.99%)  paid in cash on July 6  2023.2023 NEW OUTLOOKBased on the half-year performance  a healthy sales pipeline and the significant growth opportunities related to Sustainability  Bureau Veritas now expects for full-year 2023 to deliver:mid-to-high single-digit organic revenue growth (up from mid-single-digit organic revenue growth previously);a stable adjusted operating margin at constant exchange rates;strong cash flow  with a cash conversion3 above 90%.BOARD CHANGESOn June 22  2023  following the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting  the Board of Directors decided the following:Laurent Mignon appointed Chairman of the Board of Directors of Bureau VeritasLaurent Mignon was appointed Chairman of the Board.

Participants in these programs were identified as part of Bureau Veritas’ overall approach to evaluating talent and succession planning and this approach was strengthened through more robust processes; Bureau Veritas conducted a survey with its employees on Diversity  Equity & Inclusion to better understand key focus areas for strategies to achieve the Group’s vision of a fully inclusive culture.Awards:Bureau Veritas received several CSR-related awards in the first-half of 2023:the S&P Sustainability Yearbook recognizes companies  grouped by industry  that have demonstrated strong corporate sustainability. This year  Bureau Veritas is in the Top 5% S&P Global ESG Score in the Professional Services industry;Capital magazine in France recognized Bureau Veritas as an “entreprise engagée pour la diversité” (company committed to diversity) for 2023;Bureau Veritas was included in the Financial Times’ list of “Diversity leaders 2023”.ANALYSIS OF THE GROUP'S RESULTS AND FINANCIAL POSITIONRevenue up 7.8% year on year (up 9.4% on an organic basis)Revenue in the first half of 2023 amounted to EUR 2 904.2 million  a 7.8% increase compared with H1 2022.The organic increase was 9.4% compared with H1 2022  of which 10.3% in the second quarter of 2023  benefiting from solid market trends across most businesses and geographies.Four businesses delivered very strong organic growth: Marine & Offshore  up 15.6%  Industry  up 15.5%  Certification  up 11.2%  and Buildings & Infrastructure (B&I)  up 10.8%. Agri-Food & Commodities grew 6.5% organically  led by all segments. Conversely  Consumer Products Services declined 3.1% organically due to fewer new product launches and lower volumes.By geography  the Americas was amongst the best performing region (28% of revenue; up 12.4% organically)  primarily led by a 25.9% increase in South America with a good performance in Brazil and Chile notably. Growth in Europe (35% of revenue; up 8.6% organically) was broad-based across most countries. Business in Asia-Pacific (28% of revenue; up 6.3% organically) benefited from a gradual recovery in China (concentrated in Q2)  while double-digit growth was delivered in Australia. Finally  Africa and the Middle East (9% of revenue) outperformed the Group with organic revenue growth of 14.4%  essentially driven by Buildings & Infrastructure and energy projects in the Middle East.The scope effect was a positive 1.5%  reflecting bolt-on acquisitions realized in the past few quarters.Currency fluctuations had a negative impact of 3.1% (including a negative impact of 4.9% in Q2)  mainly due to the strength of the euro against most currencies.Adjusted operating profit up 5.7% to EUR 434.2 millionAdjusted operating profit increased by 5.7% to EUR 434.2 million. First half 2023 adjusted operating margin was organically resilient as the Group managed to deliver broadly the same margin (15.2%) as last year (15.3%) despite inflationary pressures and the mixed performance of Consumer Products Services. Foreign exchange trends were a negative impact of 21bps on the Group’s margin due to the strength of the euro against other currencies  while scope only had a slight negative impact of 2bps.CHANGE IN ADJUSTED OPERATING MARGIN IN PERCENTAGE AND BASIS POINTS H1 2022 adjusted operating margin 15.3% Organic change (7)bps Organic adjusted operating margin 15.2% Scope (2)bps Constant currency adjusted operating margin 15.2% Currency (21)bps H1 2023 adjusted operating margin 15.0%The organic adjusted operating margin was largely stable with revenue growth and operating leverage delivering higher margins in Marine & Offshore  Industry and Agri-Food & Commodities offsetting lower margins in Consumer Products Services  Buildings & Infrastructure and  to some extent  Certification.Other operating expenses increased to EUR 61.3 million versus EUR 35.7 million in the first half of 2022  and comprised:EUR 21.1 million in amortization of intangible assets resulting from acquisitions (down from EUR 22.0 million in H1 2022);EUR 21.4 million in write-offs of non-current assets mainly related to the Consumer Products Services and Agri-Food & Commodities businesses;EUR 18.6 million in restructuring costs  relating chiefly to Consumer Products Services  Buildings & Infrastructure and commodities-related activities (EUR 8.9 million in H1 2022);EUR 0.2 million in net losses on disposals and acquisitions (net loss of EUR 1.1 million in H1 2022).Operating profit totaled EUR 372.9 million  broadly stable versus EUR 375.2 million in the first half of 2022.Adjusted EPS of EUR 0.61  up 11.1% year on yearNet financial expense amounted to EUR 15.2 million in the first half of 2023  compared with EUR 29.5 million in the same period one year earlier.The decrease in net finance costs to EUR 24.6 million in H1 2023 (compared with EUR 38.9 million in H1 2022) is mainly attributable to the impact of the increase in income from cash and cash equivalents.The Group posted foreign exchange gains of EUR 14.2 million in H1 2023 owing to the appreciation of the US dollar and the euro against most emerging market currencies (stable vs. H1 2022).The interest cost on pension plans amounted to a negative EUR 1.5 million in H1 2023 compared with a positive EUR 0.8 million in H1 2022.Consolidated income tax expense stood at EUR 113.2 million for H1 2023  compared with EUR 111.1 million for H1 2022.This represents an effective tax rate (ETR) of 31.6% for the period  versus a 32.1% in H1 2022.The adjusted effective tax rate decreased by 0.6 percentage points compared to H1 2022  to 30.7%. It corresponds to the effective tax rate adjusted for the tax effect of adjustment items. The decrease is mainly due to the reduction in dividend distributions from countries subject to withholding tax during the period.Attributable net profit for the period was EUR 232.5 million  versus EUR 225.2 million in H1 2022.Earnings per share (EPS) was EUR 0.51  compared with EUR 0.50 in H1 2022.Adjusted attributable net profit totaled EUR 276.3 million  up 11.1% versus EUR 248.6 million in H1 2022.Adjusted EPS stood at EUR 0.61  a 11.1% increase versus H1 2022 (EUR 0.55 per share).Solid Free cash flow at EUR 131.9 millionHalf-year 2023 operating cash flow increased by 4.3% to EUR 222.1 million versus EUR 213.0 million in H1 2022. The increase in profit before tax was largely offset by a working capital requirement outflow of EUR 196.2 million  compared to a EUR 176.7 million outflow in the previous year. The change is explained by the strong growth delivered in the second quarter (up 10.3% organically).Working capital requirement (WCR) stood at EUR 517.6 million at June 30  2023  compared withEUR 517.2 million at June 30  2022. As a percentage of revenue  WCR decreased by 100 basis points to 8.8%  compared to 9.8% in H1 2022.Purchases of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets  net of disposals (Net Capex)  amounted to EUR 76.4 million in the first half of 2023  up 46.9% compared to the H1 2022 figure of EUR 52.0 million. The Group’s net capex-to-revenue ratio increased to 2.6% in order to finance growth in its laboratory activities. It was up 70 basis points from the low H1 2022 (1.9%).Free cash flow (operating cash flow after tax  interest expenses and capex) wasEUR 131.9 million  compared to EUR 129.9 million in H1 2022  up 1.5% year on year.

In the second half  the Group expects slower growth in percentage terms as compared to an exceptionally strong H2 2022 (catch-up effect post lockdowns in China and one-off regulatory benefits in Q4 2022). At June 30  2023  the fleet classified by Bureau Veritas comprised 11 577 ships  representing 146.5 million of Gross Register Tonnage (GRT).activity (46% of divisional revenue)  which benefitted from a continuing high level of occasional surveys  combined with price increases and the growth of the classified fleet. In the second half  the Group expects slower growth in percentage terms as compared to an exceptionally strong H2 2022 (catch-up effect post lockdowns in China and one-off regulatory benefits in Q4 2022). At June 30  2023  the fleet classified by Bureau Veritas comprised 11 577 ships  representing 146.5 million of Gross Register Tonnage (GRT). Double-digit organic revenue growth for Services (15% of divisional revenue  including Offshore) was driven by a combination of strong commercial development for non-classification services  including consulting services related to energy efficiency.Bureau Veritas new orders reached 4.3 million gross tons at June 30  2023  bringing the order book to 20.4 million gross tons at the end of the semester  up 13.3% compared to 18.0 million gross tons at end-June 2022. It is composed of LNG fueled ships  container ships and specialized vessels.The division continued to benefit from its market leader positioning on alternative fuels  mainly LNG and methanol dual propulsion.Marine & Offshore continued to focus on efficiency levers through digitalization and high added-value services. In April 2023  Bureau Veritas and Kongsberg launched a digitally optimized machinery maintenance platform that enables its Machinery Maintenance Application (MMA) to connect directly to a vessel operator’s own maintenance management system  K-Fleet from Kongsberg Digital (more information by clicking here).Adjusted operating margin for the half year improved by 22 basis points to 24.7% on a reported basis compared to H1 2022  negatively impacted by foreign exchange effects (91 basis points). Organically  it rose by 113 basis points  benefiting from operating leverage  a positive mix and operational excellence.Sustainability achievementsThe Group continues to innovate on future fuels and new propulsion systems. In the second quarter of 2023  it has issued an Approval in Principle (AIP) to Rotoboost’s thermocatalytic decomposition process for carbon capture. Rotoboost’s technology converts natural gas into hydrogen and solid carbon using a liquid catalyst. The hydrogen can be used for fuel cells or as blend-in fuel for combustion engines or gas fired boilers.The Group has also been working on ship financing aligned with maritime’s decarbonization goals. It has developed a tool to build realistic decarbonization trajectories for shipping based on a bottom-up methodology. It also supported a pool of banks in the definition of their own strategies related to decarbonization.AGRI-FOOD & COMMODITIESIN EUR MILLIONS H1 2023 H1 2022 CHANGE ORGANIC SCOPE CURRENCY Revenue 611.6 588.0 +4.0% +6.5% - (2.5)% Adjusted Operating Profit 82.3 76.2 +8.0% Adjusted Operating Margin 13.5% 13.0% +50bps +66bps - (16)bpsThe Agri-Food & Commodities business delivered organic revenue growth of 6.5% in the first half of 2023  with positive trends for all activities. In Q2  Group organic revenue increased by 5.4%.Oil & Petrochemicals (O&P  30% of divisional revenue) achieved mid-single digit organic revenue growth overall. Steady growth was recorded for the O&P Trade market  driven by higher volumes and pricing initiatives. Particularly strong growth was achieved in Europe  led by market share gains in key locations and increased activity (Belgium  Greece). Throughout the first half  non-trade related services and value-added segments such as Verifuel bunker quantity services and sustainability-driven solutions continued to expand across O&P. The Group is gaining momentum with its new initiatives for biofuels and OCM (Oil Condition Monitoring)  which both grew high double digits organically.Metals & Minerals (M&M  33% of divisional revenue) grew mid-single digits on an organic basis. The Upstream business (nearly two-thirds of M&M) showed solid growth (up 3.1% organically). The Group continued to benefit from the success of its on-site laboratories’ strategy with several important wins in the period (including an iron ore mine in Australia and a copper mine in Chile). In mining related testing  the activity continued to be driven by a mix of gold  energy transition metals and bulk minerals. Trade activities recorded double-digit organic revenue growth (up 10.3% organically). This was fueled by all the main commodities  with strong trade volumes in Asia  the Middle East and Southern Africa as well as by pricing initiatives.Agri-Food (22% of divisional revenue) achieved high-single digits organic growth in the first half  led by Agricultural products. Agricultural inspection activities grew strongly  benefiting from solid trends in Europe and notably in the entire Danube corridor triggered by the changes of routes. Activity in the Middle East was particularly strong following the opening of a new laboratory and good sales performance. The Food business grew mid-single digits organically  with improvement achieved in the second quarter. Inspection activities delivered stronger growth than testing activities  benefiting notably from a favorable regulatory environment for traceability services in Europe (EU Deforestation Regulation  German Supply Chain Act). Growth was delivered in the Group’s largest hubs  with Australia benefiting from its continued diversification. New geographies also contributed to growth  including the US (driven by the ramp-up of new greenfield lab openings) and Southeast Asian countries (large government contract on food safety).Government services (15% of divisional revenue) recorded high single-digit organic revenue growth in the first half. Strong growth was delivered in Asia  the Middle East and Africa led by a solid commercial development of VOC (Verification of Conformity) contracts and Single Window contracts in Africa and Central Asia.The adjusted operating margin for the Agri-Food & Commodities business rose to 13.5%  up 50 basis points compared to last year. This was led by a topline recovery and a positive business mix.Sustainability achievementsBureau Veritas was awarded a contract to deliver services for biofuels from a large waste-based biofuels producer including sampling and analyses for Fatty Acid Methyl Ester (FAME) products in the Netherlands.In the first half of 2023  the Group was awarded a Food Safety and Quality Control contract in the Middle East to support regional farmers and producers to comply with the standards and regulations demand of a new sustainable city.INDUSTRYIN EUR MILLIONS H1 2023 H1 2022 CHANGE ORGANIC SCOPE CURRENCY Revenue 618.3 562.4 +9.9% +15.5% - (5.6)% Adjusted Operating Profit 76.1 62.2 +22.4% Adjusted Operating Margin 12.3% 11.0% +125bps +147bps - (22)bpsIndustry was among the best performing businesses within the Group’s portfolio in the first half of 2023 with organic growth of 15.5%  including 18.2% growth in the second quarter.All segments and most geographies contributed to the divisional growth  with both Latin America and Africa outperforming. Energy transition  which accelerated over the period  remained a key catalyst overall and triggered clean energy investment and decarbonation solutions which benefited the division.By market  Power & Utilities (15% of divisional revenue) continued to be a key driver of growth for the portfolio with a double-digit organic performance for both Opex and Capex activities during the half year (including Q2). Growth was driven mainly by Latin America thanks to the ramp-up of contract wins with various Power Distribution clients  although the Group is more selective on contracts profitability. In Europe  the nuclear power generation segment contributed greatly to growth  notably in the UK. There are promising opportunities in the medium term for new nuclear power plants (new EPRs in France and development of Small Modular Reactors (SMR) projects in several countries) alongside dismantling projects (such as Ignalinia in Lithuania).Renewable Power Generation activities (solar  wind  hydrogen) maintained strong momentum during the period  with a high double-digit organic performance delivered across most geographies. A strong path of growth was recorded in the US  with a very dynamic performance from Bureau Veritas’ Bradley Construction Management for solar  onshore wind and high-voltage transmission projects. This benefited from easing supply chain restrictions and early opportunities from Inflation Reduction Act investment expectations. The Group is seeing increased demand and activity in both Carbon capture and Sequestration (CCS)  notably in the US where it continues to innovate.In Oil & Gas (33% of divisional revenue)  double digit organic revenue growth was achieved in the first half. The two-thirds of the business related to Opex services increased 19.7% as they continue to benefit from the conversion of a solid sales pipeline. Capex-related activities  including Procurement Services  grew low double digits organically  essentially attributable to the startup of new projects in the gas sector. This was triggered by companies’ willingness to manage their assets in a more sustainable manner (low carbon strategy towards net zero target). Large contracts ramped up in the US  Asia  Middle East and Latin America  in Brazil in particular.Elsewhere  the Automotive business (5% of divisional revenue) delivered high single-digit growth amid easing in supply chain disruptions. In July 2023  the Group sold its non-core automotive inspection business in the US  representing below EUR 20 million of annualized revenue. This is part of the Group’s active portfolio management.Adjusted operating margin for the half year increased by 125 basis points to 12.3%. This is attributable to operational leverage through the ramp-up of contracts and more selectivity when it comes to profitability.Sustainability achievementsIn Q2 2023  Bureau Veritas was awarded a major contract to provide Integrated Site Services (including the quality control of the construction works) for Scottish Power Renewables’ East Anglia THREE – one of the UK’s largest offshore windfarm projects. Once complete  it will generate up to 1 400MW of power via 95 wind turbines and power over one million homes in the UK.In the first half  the Group was also awarded contracts with five utilities companies in California (United States)  to act as an independent evaluator for Wildfire Mitigation program through audit and field inspection services. These programs are required by the Public Utilities Commission to reduce the probability for wildfires due to drier conditions associated with climate change.BUILDINGS & INFRASTRUCTUREIN EUR MILLIONS H1 2023 H1 2022 CHANGE ORGANIC SCOPE CURRENCY Revenue 868.8 777.8 +11.7% +10.8% +2.3% (1.4)% Adjusted Operating Profit 106.4 103.9 +2.4% Adjusted Operating Margin 12.2% 13.4% (111)bps (134)bps +21bps +2bpsThe Buildings & Infrastructure (B&I) business achieved strong organic growth of 10.8% in the first half of 2023  primarily fueled by the Asia-Pacific and by the Middle East regions. In Q2  revenue grew 12.4% on an organic basis thanks to double-digit performances in both CAPEX and OPEX activities. Construction-related activities (55% of divisional revenue) benefited from strong dynamics for new projects in South America (notably Brazil) and the Middle East.The Americas (27% of divisional revenue) posted high-single-digit organic growth. In Latin America  a strong performance was achieved thanks to the ongoing ramp-up of large Capex contracts for project management assistance signed in the second half of 2022  mostly focused on the energy and aluminum fields. Low single-digit H1 2023 growth was recorded in Northern America led by the datacenter commissioning market and the resilience of the code compliance activity. Some of the Capex business growth was moderated by longer decision processes and a slowdown in the commercial real estate activities on the back of rising interest rates. The pipeline remains very solid. Opex activities delivered good growth thanks to the sustained momentum on non-regulatory new services  primarily commissioned by insurance companies.In Europe (50% of divisional revenue)  strong growth was delivered on the back of a double-digit performance in Italy  Spain and the UK thanks to more stringent regulation benefiting both Opex and Capex activities. France  the region’s largest contributor (with 39% of divisional revenue)  delivered mid- to-high organic revenue growth in H1 2023. This was once again driven by a further good performance in In-service activity backed by a solid pipeline (notably in white certificate project services and inspections)  and good pricing power on mass market activity. The growth of Capex-related activities remained muted despite a good backlog and the higher weighting towards infrastructure and public works versus residential building. The pipeline of sales related to the EU Green Deal and the upcoming 2024 Olympic Games in France continued to grow with opportunities mainly focused on energy efficiency programs.The Asia-Pacific  and the Middle East & Africa regions (23% of divisional revenue) are the best-performing areas  recording a double-digit organic revenue increase in H1 2023 (and in Q2). Asia is pushed by stellar performances in India and Southeastern Asia. The Chinese activity is steadily picking up. In the Middle East region  the Group continued to deliver very high growth primarily led by the roll-out of new services linked to the development of numerous projects. As an illustration  in Saudi Arabia  the Group remained strongly engaged in delivering QA/QC Services for the NEOM project  a smart city that will be powered by renewable energy and become a center for biotechnology  media and entertainment.Adjusted operating margin for the half year declined by 111 basis points to 12.2% from 13.4% in the prior year. This was primarily attributed to unfavorable comparable following a positive one-off in social liabilities in France in H1 2022 that has mostly reversed in H2 last year.Sustainability achievementsIn the second quarter of 2023  the Group was awarded several contracts in the field of energy audits  to help clients across different industries (construction  banks  transports) to comply with the Tertiary Decree imposing energy consumption reduction commitments in the French tertiary sector.CERTIFICATIONIN EUR MILLIONS H1 2023 H1 2022 CHANGE ORGANIC SCOPE CURRENCY Revenue 227.8 209.2 +8.9% +11.2% - (2.3)% Adjusted Operating Profit 41.7 40.0 +4.3% Adjusted Operating Margin 18.3% 19.1% (80)bps (63)bps - (17)bpsThe Certification business delivered strong organic growth of 11.2% in the first half of 2023 (similar in the first and second quarters). This good performance was enhanced by the acceleration of the diversification of the Group’s portfolio. Strong commercial development and solid price increases also supported growth over the period  mostly led by very good traction in South America and Asia-Pacific  where the offering has been expanded with new schemes (with the shift from traditional QHSE schemes towards new services). This is illustrated by the sustained good performance in countries such as Brazil  Vietnam and India  on the back of good momentum for CSR-driven solutions and customized audits.Double-digit growth was recorded for QHSE schemes  Supply Chain and Food Certification (led by Food Safety)  with a strong momentum for Sustainability-related solutions. Momentum was particularly strong on certifications dedicated to companies for anti-bribery  IT service management  information security and business continuity. Similarly to Q1 2023  Cybersecurity solutions also posted stellar performances. This is due to rising demand for more control on security systems. In the United Arab Emirates  Bureau Veritas recently won an important contract to provide cybersecurity and penetration testing services on behalf of an energy company.Sustainability-driven solutions are in high demand as the search for more brand protection  data transparency  and social responsibility commitments all along the supply chain drove a 17.3% organic growth performance. It reflected a high demand for verification of greenhouse gas emissions and supply chain audits on ESG topics.The adjusted operating margin for the half year was a very healthy 18.3%  compared to 19.1% in the prior year. This reflects a 80-basis-point decrease against the record level  attributed to negative forex and mix effects.Sustainability achievementsIn the second quarter of 2023  Bureau Veritas partnered with Enhesa  a global regulatory and sustainability intelligence provider in the UK  the Netherlands and Belgium. Based on legal requirements identified through the Enhesa solution  Bureau Veritas will provide end-to-end regulatory compliance and services for organizations in these countries seeking to implement  measure and achieve their ESG  HSE and Sustainability requirements objectives.During the first half of 2023  Bureau Veritas was awarded numerous contracts in the Sustainability field. For instance  the Group won a contract to help Valeo produce wiper blades designed to reduce CO 2 emissions by 61% compared to a standard product commercialized in the European market.Bureau Veritas also signed agreements with three major datacenter companies based in Denmark to assess and verify their compliance with the Self-Regulatory Initiative (SRI) as part of the Climate Neutral Data Centre Pact (CNDCP).CONSUMER PRODUCTSIN EUR MILLIONS H1 2023 H1 2022 CHANGE ORGANIC SCOPE CURRENCY Revenue 349.1 351.5 (0.7)% (3.1)% +6.0% (3.6)% Adjusted Operating Profit 71.2 78.5 (9.3)% Adjusted Operating Margin 20.4% 22.3% (195)bps (67)bps (95)bps (33)bpsThe Consumer Products division posted a decline of 3.1% in organic revenue over the first half of 2023 (including a decline of 2.7% in the second quarter)  with varying geographical and service trends.During the period  Asia remained the region the most impacted by the global economic slowdown  while the Americas (especially Latin America) and the Middle East & Africa (led by Turkey) continue to benefit from the diversification strategy implemented over the last years and from the structural near-shoring market trends.Softlines  Hardlines & Toys (49% of divisional revenue) saw a mid-single-digit organic decrease in the first half of 2023  due to lower volumes and the resulting high inventory levels  even though the activity improved a bit in the second quarter. Softlines showed mixed performances by country: as expected  China delivered a weak performance  while contrasting dynamics were observed between Southeast and South Asian countries (Bangladesh  Pakistan  and Sri Lanka) which benefited from the continuing structural sourcing shift outside of China. Similarly  Turkey saw a strong increase in testing volumes as it continued to benefit from nearshoring shifts by European retailers. This supports the Group’s geographic diversification strategy towards new production countries that are closer to the countries of consumption.Health  Beauty & Household (8% of divisional revenue) recorded solid double-digit organic growth in H1  led by Asia and the US. South Korea benefited from its diversification into Cosmetics  Health & Beauty while Italy remained fueled by luxury and leather products. The integration of Advanced Testing Laboratory (ATL) and Galbraith Laboratories Inc.  which were both acquired last year in the US  progressed well with a promising sales pipeline. These acquisitions help Bureau Veritas strengthen its position in this growing sector.Inspection and Audit services (12% of divisional revenue) maintained their growth momentum thanks to strong growth for Sustainability services over the course of the first half of 2023: this includes organic  recycling  social audits and green claim verification across most geographies.Lastly  Technology8 (31% of divisional revenue) performed below the divisional average  still affected by the global decrease in demand for electrical and wireless equipment as well as the resulting temporary reduction in new product launches. The New Mobility sub-segment delivered double-digit growth  led by both China and the US  areas where the Group invested significantly  and which benefited from the ramp-up of new laboratories. This reflected good traction on testing on electric vehicle engines  dashboards or charging stations. In the first half of 2023  the Group continued to pursue its geographical diversification strategy to take advantage of the structural sourcing shifts currently unfolding in South and Southeast Asia. In this respect  in the first quarter  Bureau Veritas opened a new lab in Hanoi which will be fully dedicated to connectivity and wireless testing.Adjusted operating margin for the half year declined by 195 basis points to 20.4% from 22.3% in the prior year. This was primarily attributed to the decline in revenue and negative scope and forex effects. The benefits of several cost initiatives are expected to be felt in the second half of the year.Sustainability achievementsIn the first half of 2023  the Group was awarded a contract with a large American sportswear company to perform regulatory audits and Sustainability services (Energy Efficiency Directive  Energy Performance of Building Directive) across 40 countries where the brand is commercialized; through these services  Bureau Veritas supports its client in managing its ESG strategy and providing proof of its commitments.PRESENTATION H1 2023 results will be presented on Wednesday  July 26  2023  at 3:00 p.m. (Paris time) A video conference will be webcast live.

Adjusted net financial debt 930.8 975.3APPENDIX 7: DEFINITION OF ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE INDICATORS AND RECONCILIATION WITH IFRSThe management process used by Bureau Veritas is based on a series of alternative performance indicators  as presented below. These indicators were defined for the purposes of preparing the Group’s budgets and internal and external reporting. Bureau Veritas considers that these indicators provide additional useful information to financial statement users  enabling them to better understand the Group’s performance  especially its operating performance. Some of these indicators represent benchmarks in the testing  inspection and certification (“TIC”) business and are commonly used and tracked by the financial community. These alternative performance indicators should be seen as a complement to IFRS-compliant indicators and the resulting changes.GROWTHTotal revenue growthThe total revenue growth percentage measures changes in consolidated revenue between the previous year and the current year. Total revenue growth has three components:organic growth;impact of changes in the scope of consolidation (scope effect);impact of changes in exchange rates (currency effect).Organic growthThe Group internally monitors and publishes “organic” revenue growth  which it considers to be more representative of the Group’s operating performance in each of its business sectors.The main measure used to manage and track consolidated revenue growth is like-for-like  or organic growth. Determining organic growth enables the Group to monitor trends in its business excluding the impact of currency fluctuations  which are outside of Bureau Veritas’ control  as well as scope effects  which concern new businesses or businesses that no longer form part of the business portfolio. Organic growth is used to monitor the Group’s performance internally.Bureau Veritas considers that organic growth provides management and investors with a more comprehensive understanding of its underlying operating performance and current business trends  excluding the impact of acquisitions  divestments (outright divestments as well as the unplanned suspension of operations – in the event of international sanctions  for example) and changes in exchange rates for businesses exposed to foreign exchange volatility  which can mask underlying trends.The Group also considers that separately presenting organic revenue generated by its businesses provides management and investors with useful information on trends in its industrial businesses  and enables a more direct comparison with other companies in its industry.Organic revenue growth represents the percentage of revenue growth  presented at Group level and for each business  based on constant scope of consolidation and exchange rates over comparable periods:constant scope of consolidation: data are restated for the impact of changes in the scope of consolidation over a 12-month period;constant exchange rates: data for the current year are restated using exchange rates for the previous year.Scope effectTo establish a meaningful comparison between reporting periods  the impact of changes in the scope of consolidation is determined:for acquisitions carried out in the current year: by deducting from revenue for the current year revenue generated by the acquired businesses in the current year;for acquisitions carried out in the previous year: by deducting from revenue for the current year revenue generated by the acquired businesses in the months in the previous year in which they were not consolidated;for disposals and divestments carried out in the current year: by deducting from revenue for the previous year revenue generated by the disposed and divested businesses in the previous year in the months of the current year in which they were not part of the Group;for disposals and divestments carried out in the previous year: by deducting from revenue for the previous year revenue generated by the disposed and divested businesses in the previous year prior to their disposal/divestment.Currency effectThe currency effect is calculated by translating revenue for the current year at the exchange rates for the previous year.ADJUSTED OPERATING PROFIT AND ADJUSTED OPERATING MARGINAdjusted operating profit and adjusted operating margin are key indicators used to measure the performance of the business  excluding material items that cannot be considered inherent to the Group’s underlying intrinsic performance owing to their nature. Bureau Veritas considers that these indicators  presented at Group level and for each business  are more representative of the operating performance in its industry.Adjusted operating profitAdjusted operating profit represents operating profit prior to adjustments for the following:amortization of intangible assets resulting from acquisitions;impairment of goodwill;impairment and retirement of non-current assets;gains and losses on disposals of businesses and other income and expenses relating to acquisitions (fees and costs on acquisitions of businesses  contingent consideration on acquisitions of businesses);restructuring costs.When an acquisition is carried out during the financial year  the amortization of the related intangible assets is calculated on a time proportion basis.Since a measurement period of 12 months is allowed for determining the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities  amortization of intangible assets in the year of acquisition may  in some cases  be based on a temporary measurement and be subject to minor adjustments in the subsequent reporting period  once the definitive value of the intangible assets is known.Organic adjusted operating profit represents operating profit adjusted for scope and currency effects over comparable periods:at constant scope of consolidation: data are restated based on a 12-month period;at constant exchange rates: data for the current year are restated using exchange rates for the previous year.The scope and currency effects are calculated using a similar approach to that used for revenue for each component of operating profit and adjusted operating profit.Adjusted operating marginAdjusted operating margin expressed as a percentage represents adjusted operating profit divided by revenue. Adjusted operating margin can be presented on an organic basis or at constant exchange rates  thereby  in the latter case  providing a view of the Group’s performance excluding the impact of currency fluctuations  which are outside of Bureau Veritas’ control.ADJUSTED EFFECTIVE TAX RATEThe effective tax rate (ETR) represents income tax expense divided by the amount of pre-tax profit.The adjusted effective tax rate (adjusted ETR) represents income tax expense adjusted for the tax effect on adjustment items divided by pre-tax profit before taking into account the adjustment items (see adjusted operating profit definition).ADJUSTED NET PROFITAdjusted attributable net profitAdjusted attributable net profit is defined as attributable net profit adjusted for adjustment items (see adjusted operating profit definition) and for the tax effect on adjustment items. Adjusted attributable net profit excludes non-controlling interests in adjustment items and only concerns continuing operations.Adjusted attributable net profit can be presented at constant exchange rates  thereby providing a view of the Group’s performance excluding the impact of currency fluctuations  which are outside of Bureau Veritas’ control. The currency effect is calculated by translating the various income statement items for the current year at the exchange rates for the previous year.Adjusted attributable net profit per shareAdjusted attributable net profit per share (adjusted EPS or earnings per share) is defined as adjusted attributable net profit divided by the weighted average number of shares in the period.FREE CASH FLOWFree cash flow represents net cash generated from operating activities (operating cash flow)  adjusted for the following items:purchases of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets;proceeds from disposals of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets;interest paid.Net cash generated from operating activities is shown after income tax paid.Organic free cash flow represents free cash flow at constant scope and exchange rates over comparable periods:at constant scope of consolidation: data are restated based on a 12-month period;at constant exchange rates: data for the current year are restated using exchange rates for the previous year.The scope and currency effects are calculated using a similar approach to that used for revenue for each component of net cash generated from operating activities and free cash flow.FINANCIAL DEBTGross debtGross debt (or gross finance costs/financial debt) represents bank loans and borrowings plus bank overdrafts.Net debtNet debt (or net finance costs/financial debt) as defined and used by the Group represents gross debt less cash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents comprise marketable securities and similar receivables as well as cash at bank and on hand.Adjusted net debtAdjusted net debt (or adjusted net finance costs/financial debt) as defined and used by the Group represents net debt taking into account currency and interest rate hedging instruments.CONSOLIDATED EBITDAConsolidated EBITDA represents net profit before interest  tax  depreciation  amortization and provisions  adjusted for any entities acquired over the last 12 months.

As expected  EBITDA was impacted by non-cash share-based compensation expenses of €85 million during the second quarter of 2023  as the Company rolled out its first global equity compensation plan  which began in the fourth quarter of 2022. There was no non-cash share-based compensation expense during the second quarter of 2022. EBITDA margin was 18.7%  compared to 20.0% in the second quarter of 2022. Excluding non-cash share-based compensation expense  Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was €590 million  up 16.4% year-over-year  or 19.2% in constant currency  and Adjusted EBITDA margin improved to 21.9%  compared to 20.0% in the second quarter of 2022  as a result of revenue growth  operating leverage and cash compensation savings of €24 million associated with the equity plan rollout.H1 2023 ResultsIn the half year ended June 30  2023 (""H1 2023"")  UMG's revenue increased to €5 148 million  up by 8.7% compared to the half year ended June 30  2022 (""H1 2022"")  or 9.1% in constant currency. This increase was driven by improvements across all segments  as discussed further below.Cost of revenues  consisting of artist and product costs  increased by 7.8% to €2 811 million in H1 2023  reflecting higher revenue. Cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue decreased to 54.6% in H1 2023 from 55.1% in H1 2022 primarily driven by lower merchandising product costs.EBITDA of €767 million declined 20.1% year-over-year  or 19.8% in constant currency  and EBITDA margin was 14.9% compared to 20.3% in the first half of 2022. EBITDA and EBITDA margin were impacted by non-cash share-based compensation expenses of €345 million during H1 2023 and €2 million during H1 2022. Excluding these amounts  Adjusted EBITDA of €1 112 million  was up 15.6% year-over-year in H1 2023  or 16.2% in constant currency  and Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 1.3pp year-over-year to 21.6% driven by revenue growth  operating leverage and cash compensation savings of €33 million associated with the equity plan rollout.Operating profit declined 22.9% year-over-year  or 22.3% in constant currency  to €591 million in H1 2023 due to the higher non-cash share-based compensation expenses in the first half of 2023 compared to the first half of 2022 as discussed above.Net profit attributable to equity holders of the parent in H1 2023 amounted to €625 million compared to €241 million in H1 2022  resulting in EPS of €0.34 in H1 2023  compared to €0.13 in H1 2022. The improvement in Net profit attributable to equity holders of the parent was in part due to the variance in revaluation of investments in listed and other companies (including Spotify and Tencent Music Entertainment  among others) that was a net income in H1 2023 of €313 million compared to a net expense in H1 2022 of €567 million. Adjusted net profit  which adjusts for the revaluation of investments  non-cash share-based compensation expense  amortization of catalogues and other items  amounted to €754 million in H1 2023  compared to €664 million in H1 2022  resulting in Adjusted EPS of €0.41 in H1 2023  compared to €0.37 in H1 2022. The increase in Adjusted net profit was driven by the growth in Adjusted EBITDA.Net cash provided by operating activities before income tax paid improved 16.2% to €703 million compared to €605 million in H1 2022 despite the previously disclosed €125 million paid to settle employee tax liabilities from equity grants on non-cash share-based compensation. The improvement in Net cash provided by operating activities before income tax paid was helped by the decline in royalty advance payments  net of recoupments  which was down 57.4% to €95 million in H1 2023 from €223 million in H1 2022  due to the timing of major artist renewals and an increase in recoupment.The strong Net cash provided by operating activities before income tax paid allowed the Company to continue to strategically invest in the long-term growth of the business. Strategic investments in the period included the acquisition of a 50% stake in the entity that owns the iconic Capitol Records building in Hollywood and acquisitions of a brand services company and a niche record label  among other items. Cash paid for catalogue acquisitions decreased to €89 million in H1 2023 compared to €264 million in H1 2022. Separately  investing activities also included €75 million cash put into escrow for another catalogue acquisition. Free cash flow decreased to a €13 million outflow in H1 2023 compared to a €104 million inflow in H1 2022  mainly as a result of the higher Net cash used for investing activities. The year-over-year decline in Free cash flow was also a result of higher income taxes paid and higher net interest paid  both of which benefitted from previously disclosed tax settlements in certain jurisdictions in the prior year.UMG's dividend policy is to pay a dividend of at least 50% of adjusted net profit. UMG's Board of Directors declared an interim dividend for H1 2023 of €437 million  or €0.24 per share. The ex-dividend date will be on October 4  2023  the record date will be on October 5  2023 and the payment date will be on October 27  2023.Net debt  defined as total debt minus cash and cash equivalents  at the end of H1 2023 was €2 300 million compared to €1 810 million at the end of 2022. The increase in net debt was primarily driven by the increase in cash used for investments  tax and dividends partly compensated by strong cash generated by operating activities.Recorded MusicThree Months Ended June 30  % %Six Months Ended June 30  % % (in millions of euros) 2023 2022 YoY const.2023 2022 YoY const.(unaudited) (unaudited)(unaudited) (unaudited)Subscriptions and streaming 1 426 1 314 8.5 % 11.0 %2 755 2 524 9.2 % 9.1 % of which streaming 358 348 2.9 % 5.3 %673 658 2.3 % 1.8 % of which subscription 1 068 966 10.6 % 13.0 %2 082 1 866 11.6 % 11.6 % Downloads and other digital 61 69 (11.6 %) (10.3 %)116 137 (15.3 %) (14.7 %) Physical 326 303 7.6 % 11.3 %639 540 18.3 % 20.8 % License and other 267 236 13.1 % 16.1 %493 442 11.5 % 12.6 % Recorded Music revenues 2 080 1 922 8.2 % 10.9 %4 003 3 643 9.9 % 10.3 %EBITDA698 842 (17.1 %) (16.7 %) EBITDA margin17.4 % 23.1 % (5.7pp)Adjusted EBITDA969 842 15.1 % 15.6 % Adjusted EBITDA margin24.2 % 23.1 % 1.1ppNote: % YoY indicates % change year-over-year; % const. indicates % change year-over-year adjusted for constant currency.Q2 2023Recorded Music revenue for the second quarter of 2023 was €2 080 million  up 8.2% compared to the second quarter of 2022  or 10.9% in constant currency.

As previously disclosed in UMG's Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31  2021  UMG adjusted its accounting policy in relation to certain revenues that are collected through societies (the ""Change in Society Accounting""). Of particular note  the €98 million impact associated with the Change in Society Accounting in the second quarter of 2022 reflected a one-time catch-up for the receipt of higher income than was accrued at the end of 2021.

Performance revenue grew 169.4% year-over-year  or 185.3% in constant currency  due to the Change in Society Accounting that had a negative impact in the prior year as well as better than expected receipts following the COVID recovery. Synchronization revenue improved 1.7% year-over-year  or 5.3% in constant currency  due to the timing of deals.

Excluding this prior-year benefit  Music Publishing revenues grew 18.1% year-over-year  or 18.5% in constant currency  as a result of the continued organic growth in streaming and subscription revenue and improvement in synchronisation and performance revenue.Music Publishing EBITDA of €186 million declined 7.0% year-over-year on both a reported and constant currency basis  while Music Publishing EBITDA margin declined 2.6pp to 20.9% from 23.5% in the first half of 2022.

In prior years  these revenues were recognized when the relevant collection society notified UMG of the usage by the end customer and collectability was assured. Recognition of that revenue  in both 2022 and 2023  is based on an accrual for the best available estimate of when the usage occurs and the amount of consideration which is probable to be collected. This has affected the timing of the recognition of certain revenues across financial reporting quarters compared to periods before 2022 and also notably in the second quarter of 2022 reflected the receipt of higher income than was accrued at the end of 2021.Conference Call DetailsThe Company will host a conference call to discuss these results on July 26  2023 at 6:15PM CEST.

As expected  EBITDA was impacted by non-cash share-based compensation expenses of €85 million during the second quarter of 2023  as the Company rolled out its first global equity compensation plan  which began in the fourth quarter of 2022. There was no non-cash share-based compensation expense during the second quarter of 2022. EBITDA margin was 18.7%  compared to 20.0% in the second quarter of 2022. Excluding non-cash share-based compensation expense  Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was €590 million  up 16.4% year-over-year  or 19.2% in constant currency  and Adjusted EBITDA margin improved to 21.9%  compared to 20.0% in the second quarter of 2022  as a result of revenue growth  operating leverage and cash compensation savings of €24 million associated with the equity plan rollout.H1 2023 ResultsIn the half year ended June 30  2023 (""H1 2023"")  UMG's revenue increased to €5 148 million  up by 8.7% compared to the half year ended June 30  2022 (""H1 2022"")  or 9.1% in constant currency. This increase was driven by improvements across all segments  as discussed further below.Cost of revenues  consisting of artist and product costs  increased by 7.8% to €2 811 million in H1 2023  reflecting higher revenue. Cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue decreased to 54.6% in H1 2023 from 55.1% in H1 2022 primarily driven by lower merchandising product costs.EBITDA of €767 million declined 20.1% year-over-year  or 19.8% in constant currency  and EBITDA margin was 14.9% compared to 20.3% in the first half of 2022. EBITDA and EBITDA margin were impacted by non-cash share-based compensation expenses of €345 million during H1 2023 and €2 million during H1 2022. Excluding these amounts  Adjusted EBITDA of €1 112 million  was up 15.6% year-over-year in H1 2023  or 16.2% in constant currency  and Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 1.3pp year-over-year to 21.6% driven by revenue growth  operating leverage and cash compensation savings of €33 million associated with the equity plan rollout.Operating profit declined 22.9% year-over-year  or 22.3% in constant currency  to €591 million in H1 2023 due to the higher non-cash share-based compensation expenses in the first half of 2023 compared to the first half of 2022 as discussed above.Net profit attributable to equity holders of the parent in H1 2023 amounted to €625 million compared to €241 million in H1 2022  resulting in EPS of €0.34 in H1 2023  compared to €0.13 in H1 2022. The improvement in Net profit attributable to equity holders of the parent was in part due to the variance in revaluation of investments in listed and other companies (including Spotify and Tencent Music Entertainment  among others) that was a net income in H1 2023 of €313 million compared to a net expense in H1 2022 of €567 million. Adjusted net profit  which adjusts for the revaluation of investments  non-cash share-based compensation expense  amortization of catalogues and other items  amounted to €754 million in H1 2023  compared to €664 million in H1 2022  resulting in Adjusted EPS of €0.41 in H1 2023  compared to €0.37 in H1 2022. The increase in Adjusted net profit was driven by the growth in Adjusted EBITDA.Net cash provided by operating activities before income tax paid improved 16.2% to €703 million compared to €605 million in H1 2022 despite the previously disclosed €125 million paid to settle employee tax liabilities from equity grants on non-cash share-based compensation. The improvement in Net cash provided by operating activities before income tax paid was helped by the decline in royalty advance payments  net of recoupments  which was down 57.4% to €95 million in H1 2023 from €223 million in H1 2022  due to the timing of major artist renewals and an increase in recoupment.The strong Net cash provided by operating activities before income tax paid allowed the Company to continue to strategically invest in the long-term growth of the business. Strategic investments in the period included the acquisition of a 50% stake in the entity that owns the iconic Capitol Records building in Hollywood and acquisitions of a brand services company and a niche record label  among other items. Cash paid for catalogue acquisitions decreased to €89 million in H1 2023 compared to €264 million in H1 2022. Separately  investing activities also included €75 million cash put into escrow for another catalogue acquisition. Free cash flow decreased to a €13 million outflow in H1 2023 compared to a €104 million inflow in H1 2022  mainly as a result of the higher Net cash used for investing activities. The year-over-year decline in Free cash flow was also a result of higher income taxes paid and higher net interest paid  both of which benefitted from previously disclosed tax settlements in certain jurisdictions in the prior year.UMG's dividend policy is to pay a dividend of at least 50% of adjusted net profit. UMG's Board of Directors declared an interim dividend for H1 2023 of €437 million  or €0.24 per share. The ex-dividend date will be on October 4  2023  the record date will be on October 5  2023 and the payment date will be on October 27  2023.Net debt  defined as total debt minus cash and cash equivalents  at the end of H1 2023 was €2 300 million compared to €1 810 million at the end of 2022. The increase in net debt was primarily driven by the increase in cash used for investments  tax and dividends partly compensated by strong cash generated by operating activities.Recorded MusicThree Months Ended June 30  % %Six Months Ended June 30  % % (in millions of euros) 2023 2022 YoY const.2023 2022 YoY const.(unaudited) (unaudited)(unaudited) (unaudited)Subscriptions and streaming 1 426 1 314 8.5 % 11.0 %2 755 2 524 9.2 % 9.1 % of which streaming 358 348 2.9 % 5.3 %673 658 2.3 % 1.8 % of which subscription 1 068 966 10.6 % 13.0 %2 082 1 866 11.6 % 11.6 % Downloads and other digital 61 69 (11.6 %) (10.3 %)116 137 (15.3 %) (14.7 %) Physical 326 303 7.6 % 11.3 %639 540 18.3 % 20.8 % License and other 267 236 13.1 % 16.1 %493 442 11.5 % 12.6 % Recorded Music revenues 2 080 1 922 8.2 % 10.9 %4 003 3 643 9.9 % 10.3 %EBITDA698 842 (17.1 %) (16.7 %) EBITDA margin17.4 % 23.1 % (5.7pp)Adjusted EBITDA969 842 15.1 % 15.6 % Adjusted EBITDA margin24.2 % 23.1 % 1.1ppNote: % YoY indicates % change year-over-year; % const. indicates % change year-over-year adjusted for constant currency.Q2 2023Recorded Music revenue for the second quarter of 2023 was €2 080 million  up 8.2% compared to the second quarter of 2022  or 10.9% in constant currency.

As previously disclosed in UMG's Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31  2021  UMG adjusted its accounting policy in relation to certain revenues that are collected through societies (the ""Change in Society Accounting""). Of particular note  the €98 million impact associated with the Change in Society Accounting in the second quarter of 2022 reflected a one-time catch-up for the receipt of higher income than was accrued at the end of 2021.

Synchronization revenue improved 1.7% year-over-year  or 5.3% in constant currency  due to the timing of deals. Mechanical revenue grew 26.1% year-over-year  or 31.8% in constant currency  as a result of improvements in physical sales.H1 2023Music Publishing revenue amounted to €889 million in H1 2023  up 4.5% year-over-year  or 4.8% in constant currency  despite the previously disclosed Change in Society Accounting which resulted in a one-time benefit in the second quarter of 2022. Excluding this prior-year benefit  Music Publishing revenues grew 18.1% year-over-year  or 18.5% in constant currency  as a result of the continued organic growth in streaming and subscription revenue and improvement in synchronisation and performance revenue.Music Publishing EBITDA of €186 million declined 7.0% year-over-year on both a reported and constant currency basis  while Music Publishing EBITDA margin declined 2.6pp to 20.9% from 23.5% in the first half of 2022.

In prior years  these revenues were recognized when the relevant collection society notified UMG of the usage by the end customer and collectability was assured. Recognition of that revenue  in both 2022 and 2023  is based on an accrual for the best available estimate of when the usage occurs and the amount of consideration which is probable to be collected. This has affected the timing of the recognition of certain revenues across financial reporting quarters compared to periods before 2022 and also notably in the second quarter of 2022 reflected the receipt of higher income than was accrued at the end of 2021.Conference Call DetailsThe Company will host a conference call to discuss these results on July 26  2023 at 6:15PM CEST.

These results have been approved by the Board of Directors today and limited review procedures on the consolidated financial statements have been carried out.Vantiva's results for the first half of 2023 are in line with the Group's expectations  but as anticipated down on last year. The decline stems mainly from weaker activity in both divisions due to less favorable economic conditions and a high basis of comparison. Connected Home’s customers are experiencing a high level of inventories due to weaker demand  and SCS is suffering lower DVD demand than expected. The Group continues to apply strict cost control and efficiency measures to offset the impact of the lower volumes. Therefore  the full-year guidance is maintained.Revenues decreased by 12.9% to €1 038 million (-13.3% at constant exchange rate).Adjusted EBITDA at €49 million vs €73 million in H1 2022  representing 4.7% of revenues (vs 6.1% in H1 2022) largely explained by lower volume.Adjusted EBITA at €9 million (vs €22 million in H1 2022).The structural decrease in the DVD demand was stronger than expected and triggered a review of SCS’ legacy and growth activities assumptions. This review has led to a €133 million impairment of SCS’ goodwill.Net result from continuing operations was negative at -€227 million vs -75 million in H1 2022.Group net result was negative at €229 million vs -14 million in H1 2022 as loss from discontinued operations stood at -€2 million versus a gain of €62 million in H1 2022.Capex increased by 37.9% to €44 million to support new products development at Connected Home and to increase vinyl capacity.Free Cash Flo w   before financial and tax  was negative at - €74 million vs - €21 million in H1 2022.At the end of the semester  Vantiva held a cash position of €39 million.Total net debt (witho capital lease) amounted to €378 million in nominal terms.The Group is working on new sources of financing  better suited to the seasonal nature of its business than the current line of credit.Story continuesLuis Martinez-Amago  Chief Executive Officer of Vantiva  said:“Our first-half results in line with our expectations  but down compared to last year. As anticipated  we experienced a more difficult environment and weaker demand from some of our clients in the Connected Home sector. The latter are seeing high inventory levels coming from a strong 2022  and weaker consumer demand this year. The DVD activity is still suffering from a structural decline  more severe than expected in H1. However  our productivity improvements and diversification strategy will gradually turn around this activity. We expect some recovery in H2 and this combined with the positive impact of the efficiency measures taken allow us to confirm the guidance for the full year. Moreover  I would like to thank all our employees for their contribution to this goal. The Group is fully focused on implementing our diversification plans  productivity improvements and preparing the next generation of products that will drive the business in the future as proven by the first successes of our Wi-Fi 7 and DOCSIS 4.0 offers.”I- H1 2023 Key Highlights & 2023 OutlookIn € million  continuing operations H1 2023 H1 2022 Change at current rate Change at constant Rate Revenues 1 038 1 193 (12.9)% (13.3)% Adjusted EBITDA 49 73 (32.4)% (33.3)% As a % of revenues 4.7% 6 1% (137)bps (141)bps Adjusted EBITA 9 22 (58.5)% (60.0)% Free Cash Flow before Financial & Tax (74) (21) (53)2022 amounts restated considering Technicolor Creatives Studios accounted for as discontinued operationsH1 2023 Key HighlightsThe demand from some of our large Connected Home customers has been lower than in the previous year as the global economic environment makes them cautious  especially regarding their inventory management. This has been particularly true in the North America and APAC regions which had enjoyed strong business trends a year ago. The decrease in optical discs demand has been more severe than expected. Beyond the structural decline  demand suffered from excess inventory built by our customers during the chips crisis. On the other hand  the ramp up of vinyl production ramp up has mitigated this negative effect to some extent. The Group continues to take the measures necessary to defend its profitability.Vantiva revenues totaled €1 038 million  down 12.9% (-13.3% at constant exchange rate).Connected Home revenues amounted to €807 million for the half  a decrease of 10% (-10.3% at constant exchange rate). Supply Chain Solutions revenues were €231 million  down 21.9% (-22.4% at constant exchange rate).Adjusted EBITDA  despite strict cost control in both divisions  has been negatively impacted by this volume decline and fell by €24 million to amount to €49 million in the semester vs €73 million in H1 2022.Connected Home contributed €56 million (versus €70 million in the previous year) to adjusted EBITDA while Supply Chain Solutions contributed €7 million (versus €15 million in H1 last year).FCF  before financial and tax for the half was negative by -€74 million  showing a €53 million deterioration over last year  due to lower EBITDA  higher capex and a less favorable change in working capital.Outlook 2023For the second part of the year Vantiva expects some recovery in demand and positive impact from the actions implemented to preserve profitability.Revenues of Connected Home division  as planned  are expected to be down compared to last year. Broadband products should grow somewhat but video devices will continue to decline.The DVD business will still be under pressure  but we expect some normalization in the demand in H2. SCS’ full year revenue is likely to remain below last year’s level.Against this backdrop and  thanks to its operational efficiency  the Group is maintaining its targets for FY 2023:EBITDA > €140mEBITA > €45mFCF 2 > €50mII- Segment Review – H1 2023 Results HighlightsConnected HomeRevenues breakdown by productIn € million H1 2023 H1 2022 Change at current rate Change at constant rate Revenues 807 897 (10.0)% (10.3)% o/w by product Broadband 647 694 (6.8)% (7.5)% Video 160 202 (20.8)% (19.7)% EBITDA adj 56 70 (19)% (19.8)% As a % of revenues 7.0% 7.8%Connected Home revenues contributed 78% of Group revenues (75% in H1 22) and totaled €807 million in the semester  down 10%. At constant exchange rate  the decrease would have been -10.3% compared with H1 2022. Sales of broadband products in our largest region  North America  were down as operators cautiously managed their level of inventories and in Asia Pacific revenues have been penalized by a change of product generation. LATAM and EMEA reported double digit growth thanks to fiber which remains the growth driver. Cable demand has been slightly down and xDSL in decline. Globally Broadband revenues were down 6.8% in the period  whereas Video revenues decreased by 20.8%. LATAM has been particularly hit by weak demand for satellite TV devices.Adjusted EBITDA of the division amounted to €56 million (vs €70 million in H1 22)  or 7% of revenues (vs 7.8% in H1 22). Despite the drop in revenues  the division has been able to limit the margin decline to 80 basis points thanks to strict cost control and operational efficiency. Chips availability has improved materially and lead-times are getting better  but prices remain high.Supply Chain SolutionsIn € million H1 2023 H1 2022 Change atcurrent rate Change atconstant rate Revenues 231 296 (21.9)% (22.4)% o/w by activity Disc 193 265 (27.1)% (27.5)% Growth activities 38 30 24.0% 22.9% EBITDA 7 15 (55.0)% (55.2)% As a % of revenues 3.0% 5.2%Supply Chain Solutions revenues totaled €231 million in the period  down 21.9% from H1 2022. At constant exchange rate the decline would have been 22.4%. The structural decline of the optical disc activity  has been amplified by a less favorable economic environment and inventory adjustments  especially in the US. This has led the major studios to reduce orders for optical discs and associated services. Globally Discs revenues were down 27.1% in the half.The diversification activities performed better showing 24.0% revenue growth  but this was not enough to compensate for the 40% volume decline in discs. In contrast  the production of vinyl has benefited from higher capacity and the ramp up is accelerating.Adjusted EBITDA of the division amounted to €7 million (vs €15m in H1 22)  or 3.0% of revenues (5.2% in H1 22). Margin decline came from the lower volumes in optical discs  distribution and freight activities while the development of the diversification activities has not been strong enough to offset the impact of the optical discs decline.Corporate & OtherIn € million H1 2023 H1 2022 Change atcurrent rate Change atconstant rate Revenues 0 0 EBITDA (14) (12) nm nm As a % of revenues ns ns2022 amounts restated considering Technicolor Creatives Studios accounted for as discontinued operations.Corporate & Other have no more revenues and the corporate costs explain the EBITDA negative contribution of €14 million vs €12 million in H1 2022.III- Results analysisP&L analysisIn € million H1 2023 H1 2022 Change at current rate Change at constant rate Revenues from continuing operations 1 038 1 193 (12.9)% (13.3)% Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations 49 73 (32.4)% (33.3)% As a % of revenues 4 7% 6 1% (137)bps (141)bps D&A & Reserves1  witho PPA amortization (40) (51) 21% 21.6% Adjusted EBITA from continuing operations 9 22 (58.5)% (60.0)% As a % of revenues 0.9% 1.9% (97)bps (100)bps PPA amortization (13) (16) 16.1% 17.0% Non-recurring items (146) (17) nm nm EBIT from continuing operations (150) (11) nm nm As a % of revenues (14.5)% (0.9)% na na Net financial income (loss) (55) (61) (10.0)% (10.5)% Income tax 3 (4) nm nm Gain (loss) from associates (25) 0 nm nm Profit (loss) from continuing operations (227) (75) nm nm Net gain (loss) from discontinued operations (2) 62 nm nm Net income (loss) (229) (14) nm nm1Risk  litigation and warranty reserves2022 amounts restated considering Technicolor Creatives Studios accounted for as discontinued operations.H1 Revenues stood at €1 038 million  representing a 12.9% decrease (-13.3% at constant exchange rate) The decrease of Connected Home (-10%) was driven by the North America and APAC regions where some large customers reduced their business in order to avoid developing a too high level of inventories. SCS suffered from the decrease of DVD demand  largely in the US partly due to inventories adjustment from the major studios.H1 Adjusted EBITDA amounted to €49 million  down 32 4% year-on-year and represented 4 7% of the revenues. Both division’s contributions fell in the first half  being impacted by lower volume  and the corporate costs were slightly higher than a year ago.H1 Adjusted EBITA of €9 million represented a €13 million year-on-year decrease  despite lower depreciation.PPA amortization was slightly down at -€13 million versus -€16 in H1 2022.Non-recurring items amounted to -€146 million versus -€17 million a year ago:restructuring costs accounting for -€8 million versus -€6 million in H1 2022.other income and expenses of -€4 million showed an improvement over H1 2022 of €5 million.net impairment stood at -€135 million (versus -€2 million) mostly because of the €133 million impairment of SCS’ goodwill.EBIT from continuing operations was a -€150 million loss compared to -€11 million.The financial result totaled -€55 million in the first half  compared to -€61 million in H1 2022. This improvement stems from the financial interest costs  which decreased by €34 million. However  part of this improvement has been offset by the fair value adjustment of the TCS’ shares from the date of their deconsolidation  the 8th of June  to the end of the semester.Income tax is a positive of €3 million  thanks to deferred tax in Mexico  whereas it was a negative of €4 million a year ago.Result from associated is negative of 25 million mostly resulting from a depreciation of our stake in TCS from the first of January to the deconsolidation date.Net loss from continued operations amounted to -€227 million compared to -€75 million in H1 2022.Result of discontinued operations showed a small loss of €2 million.Group net result therefore is a loss of €229 million in the half  compared to a loss of -€14 million in H1 2022.FCF and debt analysisIn € million H1 2023 H1 2022 Change at current rate Change at constant rate Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations 49 73 (32.4)% (33.3)% Capex (44) (32) 37.9% 36.5% Non-recurring items (cash impact) (26) (29) (9.4)% (9.2%) Change in working capital and other assets and liabilities (54) (34) (20) Free Cash Flow from continuing operations before Tax & Financial (74) (21) (53) na2022 amounts restated considering Technicolor Creatives Studios accounted for as discontinued operations.30/06/2023 31/12/2022 Nominal gross debt (including Lease debt) 487 449 Cash and cash equivalent (39) (167) Net financial debt at nominal value (non IFRS) 448 282 IFRS adjustment (9) (19) Net financial debt (IFRS) 439 2632022 amounts restated considering Technicolor Creatives Studios accounted for as discontinued operations.Capex increased 37.9% and reached €44 million in the semester as Connected Home is investing in new products  including IOT for verticals  and SCS in additional capacity for vinyl production.Free Cash Flow3 went from -€21 million to -€74 million. This significant downgrade reflects the lower EBITDA (-€24 million)  higher capex (-€12 million) and other change in working capital (-€20 million).The cash position at the end of June 2023 was €39 million reflecting the working capital seasonality.AppendixDebt detailsIn € millionLine Characteristics Nominal IFRS amount Nominal Rate IFRS Rate Barclays Cash: Euribor 3M + 2.50% & PIK 250 241 9.0% 13.3% Angelo Gordon Cash: Euribor 3M + 4.00% & PIK 125 117 12.5% 17.6% Wells Fargo WF Prime +2.0% 29 29 10.7% 10.7% Operating Lease 70 70 13.9% 13.9% Capital Lease 0 0 1.0% 1.0% Other 13 20 0.0% 0.0% Total Debt 487 478 10.5% 13.7% Cash & Cash Equivalents 39 39 Net Debt 448 439IFRS 16 impactActual H1 23 (incl IFRS 16) Actual H1 23(excl.
