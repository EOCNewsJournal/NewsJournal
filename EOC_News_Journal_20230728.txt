In this announcement “Shell”  “Shell Group” and “Group” are sometimes used for convenience where references are made to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general. Likewise  the words “we”  “us” and “our” are also used to refer to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general or to those who work for them. These terms are also used where no useful purpose is served by identifying the particular entity or entities. ‘‘Subsidiaries’’  “Shell subsidiaries” and “Shell companies” as used in this announcement refer to entities over which Shell plc either directly or indirectly has control. Entities and unincorporated arrangements over which Shell has joint control are generally referred to as “joint ventures” and “joint operations”  respectively. “Joint ventures” and “joint operations” are collectively referred to as “joint arrangements”. Entities over which Shell has significant influence but neither control nor joint control are referred to as “associates”. The term “Shell interest” is used for convenience to indicate the direct and/or indirect ownership interest held by Shell in an entity or unincorporated joint arrangement  after exclusion of all third-party interest.Forward-Looking StatementsThis announcement contains forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) concerning the financial condition  results of operations and businesses of Shell. All statements other than statements of historical fact are  or may be deemed to be  forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management’s current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking statements include  among other things  statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management’s expectations  beliefs  estimates  forecasts  projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as “aim”  “ambition”  ‘‘anticipate’’  ‘‘believe’’  ‘‘could’’  ‘‘estimate’’  ‘‘expect’’  ‘‘goals’’  ‘‘intend’’  ‘‘may’’  “milestones”  ‘‘objectives’’  ‘‘outlook’’  ‘‘plan’’  ‘‘probably’’  ‘‘project’’  ‘‘risks’’  “schedule”  ‘‘seek’’  ‘‘should’’  ‘‘target’’  ‘‘will’’ and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this announcement  including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell’s products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets  and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative  judicial  fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks  including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities  delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics  such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak; and (n) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this announcement are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc’s Form 20-F for the year ended December 31  2022 (available at www.shell.com/investor and www.sec.gov). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this announcement and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement  July 27  2023. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information  future events or other information. In light of these risks  results could differ materially from those stated  implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this announcement.Shell’s Net Carbon IntensityAlso  in this announcement we may refer to Shell’s “Net Carbon Intensity”  which includes Shell’s carbon emissions from the production of our energy products  our suppliers’ carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers’ carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the term Shell’s “Net Carbon Intensity” is for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.Shell’s Net-Zero Emissions TargetShell’s operating plan  outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly  they reflect our Scope 1  Scope 2 and Net Carbon Intensity (NCI) targets over the next ten years. However  Shell’s operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target and 2035 NCI target  as these targets are currently outside our planning period. In the future  as society moves towards net-zero emissions  we expect Shell’s operating plans to reflect this movement. However  if society is not net zero in 2050  as of today  there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.Forward-Looking Non-GAAP MeasuresThis announcement may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as cash capital expenditure and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell  such as oil and gas prices  interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover  estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc’s consolidated financial statements.The contents of websites referred to in this announcement do not form part of this announcement.We may have used certain terms  such as resources  in this announcement that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC.

(Nasdaq: TW)  a leading  global operator of electronic marketplaces for rates  credit  equities and money markets  today reported financial results for the quarter ended June 30  2023.DISCUSSION OF RESULTSRates - Revenues of $160.4 million in the second quarter of 2023 increased 5.8% compared to prior year period (5.6% increase on a constant currency basis). Rates ADV was up 9.2% from prior year period  driven by strong volumes in swaps/swaptions ≥ 1-year led in part by heightened trading in shorter dated instruments and 42% increase in compression and LIBOR-transition related activity as compared to prior year period. U.S. and European government bond volumes were supported by sustained rates market volatility.Credit - Revenues of $84.0 million in the second quarter of 2023 increased 0.1% compared to prior year period (the same percentage increase on a constant currency basis). Credit ADV was down 28.8% from prior year period  as lower credit derivatives volumes reflected an overall decline in broader swap execution facility (SEF) market activity. Our share of fully electronic TRACE for U.S. High Grade was a record 14.9%  up 200 bps compared with prior year period  while U.S. High Yield was 6.2%  same as prior year period.Equities - Revenues of $22.1 million in the second quarter of 2023 decreased 2.3% compared to prior year period (2.9% decrease on a constant currency basis). Equities ADV was up 15.9% from prior year period and we reported record ADV in equity convertibles/swaps/options in the quarter. U.S. ETF growth was driven by strong wholesale activity  while institutional client engagement remained robust. European ETF volumes reflected declining overall market volumes.Money Markets - Revenues of $15.8 million in the second quarter of 2023 increased 30.1% compared to prior year period (30.0% increase on a constant currency basis)  driven by growth in our retail CDs and continued organic growth in institutional repurchase agreements. Money Markets ADV was up 14.2% from prior year period  led by record activity in global repurchase agreements and continued client adoption of Tradeweb's electronic trading solutions.Market Data - Revenues of $22.8 million in the second quarter of 2023 increased 8.3% compared to prior year period (8.2% increase on a constant currency basis). The increase was derived primarily from increased proprietary third party market data revenue.Other - Revenues of $5.5 million in the second quarter of 2023 decreased 4.4% compared to prior year period (the same percentage decrease on a constant currency basis).Operating Expenses of $194.3 million in the second quarter of 2023 increased 2.0% compared to $190.5 million in prior year period due to higher general and administrative expenses  higher technology and communications expenses and higher professional fee expenses. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in expenses related to employee compensation and benefits  primarily due to decreases in incentive compensation.Adjusted Expenses of $161.8 million increased 4.7% (4.3% increase on a constant currency basis) compared to prior year period due to higher technology and communications expenses  higher general and administrative expenses and higher depreciation and amortization.

Operating results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year.FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSThis release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Statements related to  among other things  our guidance  including full-year 2023 guidance  future performance  the industry and markets in which we operate  our expectations  beliefs  plans  strategies  objectives  prospects and assumptions and future events are forward-looking statements.We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations  assumptions  estimates and projections. While we believe these expectations  assumptions  estimates and projections are reasonable  such forward-looking statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties  many of which are beyond our control. These and other important factors  including those discussed under the heading “Risk Factors” in the documents of Tradeweb Markets Inc. on file with or furnished to the SEC  may cause our actual results  performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties  you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements contained in this release are not guarantees of future events or performance and future events  our actual results of operations  financial condition or liquidity  and the development of the industry and markets in which we operate  may differ materially from the forward-looking statements contained in this release. In addition  even if future events  our results of operations  financial condition  or liquidity  and events in the industry and markets in which we operate  are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this release  they may not be predictive of events  results or developments in future periods. Any forward-looking statement that we make in this release speaks only as of the date of such statement. Except as required by law  we do not undertake any obligation to update or revise  or to publicly announce any update or revision to  any of the forward-looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise  after the date of this release.NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESThis release contains “non-GAAP financial measures ” including Adjusted EBITDA  Adjusted EBITDA margin  Adjusted EBIT  Adjusted EBIT margin  Adjusted Net Income  Adjusted Net Income per diluted share (""Adjusted Diluted EPS"")  Adjusted Expenses  Free Cash Flow and constant currency change  which are supplemental financial measures that are not calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. We make use of non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating our past results and future prospects. We present these non-GAAP financial measures because we believe they assist investors and analysts in comparing our operating performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance.Management and our board of directors use Adjusted EBITDA  Adjusted EBITDA margin  Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBIT margin to assess our financial performance and believe they are helpful in highlighting trends in our core operating performance  while other measures can differ significantly depending on long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure  the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and capital investments. Further  our executive incentive compensation is based in part on components of Adjusted EBITDA.We use Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS as supplemental metrics to evaluate our business performance in a way that also considers our ability to generate profit without the impact of certain items. Each of the normal recurring adjustments and other adjustments included in Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS help to provide management with a measure of our operating performance over time by removing items that are not related to day-to-day operations or are non-cash expenses.We use Adjusted Expenses as a supplemental metric to evaluate our underlying operating performance over time by removing items that are not related to day-to-day operations or are non-cash expenses.We use Free Cash Flow to assess our liquidity in a way that considers the amount of cash generated from our core operations after non-acquisition related expenditures for capitalized software development costs and furniture  equipment and leasehold improvements.We present certain changes on a “constant currency” basis. Since our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars  we must translate non-U.S. dollar revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars. Constant currency change  which is a non-GAAP financial measure  is defined as change excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations. Constant currency information is calculated by translating the current period and prior period’s results using the annual average exchange rates for the prior period. We use constant currency change as a supplemental metric to evaluate our underlying performance between periods by removing the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. We present certain constant currency change information because we believe it provides investors and analysts a useful comparison of our results and trends between periods. This information should be considered in addition to  not as a substitute for  results reported in accordance with GAAP.See the attached schedules for reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures contained in this release to their most comparable GAAP financial measure. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools  and you should not consider these non-GAAP financial measures in isolation or as alternatives to net income attributable to Tradeweb Markets Inc.  net income  net income margin  earnings per share  operating income  operating expenses  cash flow from operating activities or any other financial measure prepared or derived in accordance with GAAP. You are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment included in the reconciliations. In addition  in evaluating Adjusted EBITDA  Adjusted EBITDA margin  Adjusted EBIT  Adjusted EBIT margin  Adjusted EBT  Adjusted Net Income  Adjusted Diluted EPS  Adjusted Expenses and Free Cash Flow  you should be aware that in the future  we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures.Our presentation of non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. In addition  the non-GAAP financial measures contained in this release may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies in our industry or across different industries.MARKET AND INDUSTRY DATAThis release includes estimates regarding market and industry data that we prepared based on our management’s knowledge and experience in the markets in which we operate  together with information obtained from various sources  including publicly available information  industry reports and publications  surveys  our clients  trade and business organizations and other contacts in the markets in which we operate.

Advanced Data Services reached record revenue of €56.9 million (+9.4%) driven by an increased number of clients and revenue capture  as well as a continued strong performance of the data solutions business. Custody and Settlement reported €63.7 million of revenue (+2.0%) supported by new fee schemes. Listing activity confirmed Euronext’s leadership in Europe  despite a soft IPO market  with 16 new listings. More than half of new European listings and the largest IPO in Europe took place on Euronext in Q2 2023. Listing revenue was €55.1 million (-0.5%)  negatively impacted by the NOK depreciation over the year. Non-volume-related revenue accounted for 61% of Q2 2023 revenue (vs. 59% in Q2 2022) and covered 148% of underlying operating expenses  excluding D&A (vs. 144% in Q2 2022). Fixed income trading reported strong revenue of €25.3 million (+1.4%) driven by increasing interest rates. Power trading revenue grew to €8.6 million (+24.7%) resulting from strong momentum in the European intraday electricity market and improved revenue capture. Cash equity market share and revenue capture improved  partially offsetting lower volatility environment for equity trading and clearing activities  compared to a very dynamic Q2 2022: Cash trading revenue was €65.2 million (-13.3%) reflecting improved revenue capture and market share offset by a less volatile environment. Cash revenue capture averaged 0.53bps  reflecting the immediate benefits from the new fee schemes implemented in Italy following the migration of Borsa Italiana cash markets to Optiq ® in March 2023. Equity market share increased over Q2 2023 to average 65.4% during the quarter. Clearing revenue was €29.4 million (-6.4%)  driven by the low volatility environment.Adjusted EBITDA 2 was € 216.1 million ( -2.5% ) and a djusted EBITDA margin was58. 7 % ( - 0.5 pts ): Underlying operating expenses  excluding D&A  were at €152.0 million (-0.7%)  resulting from continued cost discipline. Euronext reiterates its 2023 guidance for underlying operating expenses excluding D&A of €630 million.Adjusted net income was €142.9 million ( -0.2%) and adjusted EPS was €1.34 (-0.3%).Key figures for Q2 2023:In €m  unless stated otherwise Q2 2023 Q2 2022 % var % varl-f-l3 Revenue and income 368.1 374.7 -1.8% -0.5% Underlying operational expenses excluding D&A2 (152.0) (153.0) -0.7% +1.9% Adjusted EBITDA 216.1 221.7 -2.5% -2.1% Adjusted EBITDA margin 58.7% 59.2% -0.5pts -0.9pts Net income  share of the parent company shareholders 120.0 118.9 +0.9% Adjusted Net income  share of the parent company shareholders 142.9 143.2 -0.2% Adjusted EPS (basic  in €) 1.34 1.34 -0.3% Reported EPS (basic  in€) 1.12 1.11 +0.8% Adjusted EPS (diluted  in €) 1.34 1.34 -0.4% Reported EPS (diluted  in €) 1.12 1.11 +0.7%N et debt to reported EBITDA was at 2.6 x at the end of Q 2 2023 (vs. 2.4 x at end of Q 1 202 3   reflecting the payment of the 2022 financial year dividend )   and net debt to adjusted EBITDA was at 2.2 x .Euronext completed in July 2023 the sale of its 11.1% stake in LCH SA to LCH Group  for a cash consideration of €111 million. As a result  in Q3 2023 Euronext will incur a tax-exempted non-underlying capital gain of around €40 million and stop recording 11.1% of LCH SA’s net income.

Major steps in Q 2 202 3 for the Borsa Italiana Group integration : €44.2 million of cumulated run-rate annual EBITDA synergies were achieved since the acquisition of Borsa Italiana Group in April 2021  of which €0.4 million were delivered in Q2 2023. €4.9 million of cumulated implementation costs were incurred during Q2 2023. This brings to €90.2 million the cumulated implementation costs incurred at the end of Q2 2023. Key steps were met in the preparation for the Optiq ® migration of Borsa Italiana Group fixed income and derivatives markets planned in Q4 2023. This migration will generate costs synergies related to the termination of the contract with the current third-party trading platform provider as soon as Q4 2023. Key milestones were achieved to deliver the European expansion of Euronext Clearing on time and on budget and enable to generate targeted revenue and costs synergies as soon as Q4 2023.Stéphane Boujnah  Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Managing Board of Euronext  said:“Euronext’s Q2 2023 results demonstrate the strength of our diversification strategy towards non-volume-related activities. Euronext’srevenue remains robust  reaching €368.1 million  and remained stable at current currencies despite a negative volatility environment. This performance results from strong organic growth in the advanced data services and technology businesses. Ourpower and fixed income tradingbusinesses continue to perform extremely well resulting fromgrowth initiatives and supportive tailwinds. Euronext confirmsthis quarter again its position as theleading European listing venue  with 16 listings. Combined with our continued best-in-class cost discipline  our effortsled to an adjusted EBITDA margin of58.7%  and reported profit grew to €120.0 million.Throughout the second quarter of 2023 Euronext remains the leading trading venue in Europe  consolidating its market share and capturing value in a low volatility environment. Cash equity marketshare increased over the quarter to 65.4%  and revenue capture reached 0.53bps. This reflects  among other initiatives  the immediate benefits of the migration of Italian cash markets to Optiq®.We continue to deliver the major projects of our “Growth for Impact 2024” strategic plan. Following the successful migration of Italian cash equity markets to Optiq® in March 2023  the planned migration ofthe remaining Italian marketsis on schedulewith a first seamlessrehearsal completed inearly July. This paves the way for the migrationsof the remaining Italian cash markets this year  and the migration of the Italian derivatives markets in early 2024. These migrations willcontribute materially to the delivery of targeted synergies as soon as Q4 2023. Our teams are also progressing well with the European expansion of Euronext Clearing  and we have confirmed the extension of Euronext Clearing for the clearing of our equities as of Q4 2023 and our derivatives in Q3 2024.We alsoannounce today the launch of a share repurchase programme for a maximum amount of €200 million. This programme is enabled by our strong cash generation capabilities anddemonstrates our rigorous capital allocation strategy. This share repurchase programme will not change our deleveraging path nor our dividend policy  andwill preserve financial flexibility to capture market opportunities.”Euronext Q2 2023 financial performanceIn €m  unless stated otherwiseThe figures in this document have not been audited or reviewed by our external auditor.

The underlying operating expenses excluding D&A coverage ratio by non-volume related revenue was at 148% in Q2 2023  compared to 144% in Q2 2022.On a like-for-like basis at constant currencies  Euronext consolidated revenue and income was almost stable at -0.5%.Q2 2023 adjusted EBITDAUnderlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation slightly decreased to €152.0 million  down -0.7%  reflecting strong cost discipline in an inflationary environment.Consequently  adjusted EBITDA for the quarter totalled €216.1 million  down -2.5% compared to Q2 2022. This represents an adjusted EBITDA margin of 58.7%  down -0.5 points compared to Q2 2022 due to the decrease in volume-related revenue  which was partly offset by resilient non-trading related revenue and continued cost discipline.Q2 2023 net income  share of the parent company shareholdersDepreciation and amortisation accounted for €42.2 million in Q2 2023  an increase of +9.4% compared to Q2 2022  resulting from ongoing migration projects. PPA related to acquired businesses accounted for €20.4 million.Adjusted operating profit was €197.8 million  a -4.4% decrease compared to Q2 2022.€32.7 million of non-underlying expenses  including depreciation and amortisation  were reported in Q2 2023  related to the ongoing clearing and Optiq® migration projects.Net financing expense for Q2 2023 was €1.9 million compared to a net financing expense of €9.1 million in Q2 2022. This decrease reflects higher interest income from cash held partially offsetting the cost of issued debt.Results from equity investments amounted to €3.2 million in Q2 2023  representing the contribution received from LCH SA  in which Euronext owned an 11.1% stake until 6 July 2023. Following the disposal of Euronext’s 11.1% stake in LCH SA  the Group will not record any contribution from LCH SA from Q3 2023. In addition  Euronext will incur a €40 million tax-exempted non-underlying capital gain in Q3 2023 in relation to this disposal.Income tax for Q2 2023 was €41.2 million. This translated into an effective tax rate of 24.8% for the quarter (Q2 2022: €45.2 million and 27.1% respectively). The reduction is linked to higher non-taxable income received over the period.Share of non-controlling interests mainly relating to the Borsa Italiana Group and Nord Pool amounted to €5.2 million in Q2 2023.Consequently  the reported net income  share of the parent company shareholders  increased by +0.9% for Q2 2023 compared to Q2 2022  to €120.0 million. This represents a reported EPS of €1.12 basic and €1.12 fully diluted in Q2 2023  compared to €1.11 basic and €1.11 fully diluted in Q2 2022. The weighted number of shares used over Q2 2023 was 106 741 621 for the basic calculation and 106 989 806 for the fully diluted calculation.Adjusted net income  share of the parent company shareholders was almost stable  down -0.2% to €142.9 million. Consequently  adjusted EPS (basic) was slightly down -0.3% in Q2 2023  at €1.34 per share  based on 106 741 621 shares for Q2 2023  compared to an adjusted EPS (basic) of €1.34 per share in Q2 2022  based on 106 616 256 shares for Q2 2022.In Q2 2023  Euronext reported a net cash flow from operating activities of €139.0 million  compared to €76.8 million in Q2 2022  reflecting lower income tax paid compared to Q2 2022. As a reminder  Euronext paid in May 2023 €2.22 per ordinary share for the dividend related to the 2022 financial year. Excluding the impact on working capital from Euronext Clearing and Nord Pool CCP activities  net cash flow from operating activities accounted for 73.3% of EBITDA in Q2 2023.Business highlightsListingListing revenue  in €m unless stated otherwise Q2 2023 Q2 2022 % change Listing revenue 55.1 55.4 -0.5% Equity 25.3 26.8 -5.4% Annual fees 17.4 17.4 -0.2% Follow-ons 4.0 4.6 -12.9% IPOs 3.9 4.8 -17.3% Debts 9.2 10.0 -7.8% ETFs  Funds & Warrants 5.7 5.7 -0.5% Corporate Services 11.8 10.1 +17.4% Others 3.1 2.9 +7.6% Money raised 338 160 253 901 +33.2%Listing revenue was €55.1 million in Q2 2023  a slight decrease of -0.5% compared to Q2 2022  reflecting a resilient quarter for the listing activity partially offset by the negative impact from the depreciation of the NOK over the year.

These items can include: integration or double run costs of significant projects  restructuring costs and costs related to acquisitions that change the perimeter of the Group; one-off finance costs  gains or losses on sale of subsidiaries and impairments of investments: amortisation and impairment of intangible assets which are recognised as a result of acquisitions and mostly comprising customer relationships  brand names and software that were identified during purchase price allocation (PPA); tax related to non-underlying items.Adjusted operating profit as the operating profit adjusted for any non-underlying revenue and income and non-underlying costs  including PPA of acquired businesses;EBITDA as the operating profit before depreciation and amortisation;Adjusted EBITDA as the adjusted operating profit before depreciation and amortisation adjusted for any non-underlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation;EBITDA margin as EBITDA divided by total revenue and income;Adjusted EBITDA margin as adjusted EBITDA  divided by total revenue and income;Adjusted net income  as the net income  share of the parent company shareholders  adjusted for any non-underlying items and related tax impact.Non-IFRS financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable IFRS measures and should be read only in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements.Non-volume-related revenue definitionNon-volume-related revenue includes Listing (excluding IPOs)  Advanced Data Services  Custody & Settlement and other Post-Trade  fixed revenue from the Clearing activities (including for instance NTI and membership fees)  Investor Services  Technology Solutions  Other Income and Transitional Revenue.Adjusted EPS definitionQ2 2023 Q2 2022 Net incomereported 120.0 118.9 EPS reported 1.12 1.11 Adjustments of which revenues 0.0 (0.0) of which Operating expenses exc.

Improving execution supported another strong performance from our growth platforms in Oncology and Neuroscience in the first half of the year  while I was particularly pleased with the Rare Disease progress of the pipeline  including another regulatory approval for Bylvay in the U.S.  positive clinical-trial results for elafibranor and a favorable regulatory step for palovarotene in the U.S. These developments have the potential to significantly benefit patients across a range of indications.The performance in the first half of the year is reflected in today’s upgrade to our full-year guidance. We look forward to more milestones and further expansion of the pipeline over time through additional external-innovation transactions. I am confident  as we continue to deliver more medicines to patients  in ensuring the sustainable growth of Ipsen.”Full-year 2023 guidanceIpsen has upgraded its financial guidance for FY 2023:Total-sales growth greater than 6.0%  at constant currency (prior guidance: greater than 4.0% at constant currency). Based on the average level of exchange rates in June 2023  an adverse impact on total sales of around 3% from currencies is expectedCore operating margin greater than 30.0% of total sales  excluding any potential impact of incremental investments from future external-innovation transactions (prior guidance: around 30%)Pipeline updateSeveral announcements regarding Ipsen’s pipeline were published in June 2023:The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted its supplemental New Drug Application for Onivyde plus 5 fluorouracil/leucovorin and oxaliplatin (the NALIRIFOX regimen) as a potential first-line treatment for metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date is13 February 202413 February 2024 The U.S. FDA approved Bylvay for the treatment of cholestatic pruritus in patients from 12 months of age with Alagille syndrome (ALGS). In July 2023  the European Medicine Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) issued a positive opinion recommending the approval of Bylvay for the treatment of cholestatic pruritus in patients with ALGS aged six months or older. The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (COMP)  a scientific committee of the EMA  concurrently issued a negative opinion for the maintenance of Bylvay’s orphan drug designation in ALGS. This latter opinion prevents the retention of orphan-drug status in Bylvay’s marketing authorization in ALGS and might delay a final European Commission decision. Ipsen plans to submit an appeal in respect of the COMP opinionThe U.S. FDA Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee voted in favor of investigational palovarotene as an effective treatment  with a positive risk-benefit profile  for people living with the ultra-rare bone disease  fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP). The PDUFA goal date is 16 August 2023. In May 2023  the CHMP confirmed the negative opinion on palovarotene as a potential treatment for FOP  and it was therefore not subsequently approved by the European CommissionPositive top-line data from the pivotal ELATIVE Phase III trial were published. In the trial  the efficacy and safety of elafibranor was assessed for the treatment of patients with the rare cholestatic liver disease  primary biliary cholangitis  who have an inadequate response or intolerance to the current standard of care therapy  ursodeoxycholic acid. The trial met its primary endpoint  and full trial data will be presented at a future scientific congressUpdate on Galderma partnershipIn July 2023  Ipsen notified Galderma of the termination of the July 2014 R&D collaboration related to the parties’ respective neurotoxin programs.Ipsen will retain all rights and obligations related to its early-stage R&D neurotoxin pipeline  including the development of IPN10200 (longer-acting neurotoxin).

The incidence of consolidated revenues for the second quarter of 2023 is equal to €16.6 million  up 3.4% compared to €16.0 million in the second quarter of 2022 (+4.0% at constant exchange rates).In terms of geographical areas  countries in the EMEA and APAC macro-regions have recorded the most significant growth  reaching +15.7% and +9.6% respectively  compared to the first half of 2022  while the Americas show a slight decline (-0.6%)  mainly due to a one-off supply made during the previous fiscal year. Excluding this one-off supply  growth would have been double digit.With regards to product categories  Driver's Equipment represents the main segment (72% of total sales in the first half of the year)  up 12.3% compared to the first half of 2022  thanks to the increase recorded in all the main racewear products offered by the Group. The turnover of Car Parts signed a 11.3% decrease compared to the particularly positive first half of 2022  while the Other segment recorded a triple-digit growth (+120%)  mainly due to the sales of Racing Spirit brand  following the acquisition of the entire project by the Group during the previous year.Dealers are confirmed as the main sales channel for the Group  accounting for 62% of total sales in the first half of the year  up 8.5% compared to first half of 2022. Furthermore  revenues from Team & Car Manufacturers strongly increased (+30.5%)  due to important partnership agreements signed by the Group  while the decrease in sales to Others (-6.3%) is mainly due to a one-off supply made in 2022 to a customer outside Motorsport.Paolo Delprato  Chief Executive Officer of Racing Force Group  commented: ""According to our plan  2023 was supposed to be a transitional year  waiting for a significant boost in growth in the coming years  following the investment projects we are currently implementing and will complete next year. Recording a double-digit growth in the first half of this year once again confirms the strength of the Group and of our entire Team  the true engine of our success.

But our guiding principles—a commitment to profitable growth and to continuous innovation on behalf of our customers—never wavered.With the acquisitions of ColorLogic in late 2021 and iC3D in the second quarter of 2022  we have all the technology needed to accomplish our mission as the only full-stack technology provider for digital inkjet printing. Our focus has shifted from operating six companies to integrating one company  a powerhouse of products both for OEM printer manufacturers and for end users  typically printing companies that manufacture packaging and other products using digital inkjet technology.With inflation now trending downward in many key markets  it is possible that the worst is behind us. But we must expect difficult market conditions to continue through the second half of 2023. Our costs are under control and our cutting edge products are what the market needs  so we will profit from the recovery as it comes. While the timing of the recovery is uncertain  three things are not:Consumer product companies will continue to print labels and packagingManufacturing processes will continue moving to inkjetHybrid Software Group will be here at the heart of inkjet printing to serve the needs of the marketAll of us at Hybrid Software Group come to work every day to execute our growth strategy on behalf of our customers and stakeholders  and I would like to personally thank our dedicated employees as well as all shareholders for your continued support”.Financial highlights (unaudited)For the six months ended 30 June In thousands of euros 2023 (unaudited) 2022 (unaudited) Revenue 24 906 23 435 Operating (loss)/profit (521) 248 (Loss)/Profit before tax (922) 248 Tax credit 588 118 (Loss)/Profit for the period (334) 366 EBITDA from continuing operations 3 707 4 620 Adjusted operating profit 1 518 1 439 Adjusted net profit 1 359 958About Hybrid Software GroupThrough its operating subsidiaries  Hybrid Software Group PLC (Euronext: HYSG) is a leading developer of enterprise software for industrial print manufacturing.

The statutory auditors conducted an interim review of these half-year financial statements.Ekinops H1 2023 EBITDA up 33%: record high EBITDA margin of 20.2% (PRNewsfoto/Ekinops)m€ - IFRS H1 2022 H1 2023 Change Revenue 63.3 71.0 +12 % Gross margin 33.5 37.7 +13 % % of revenue 52.9 % 53.1 %Operating expenses 29.3 31.0 +6 % EBITDA1 10.8 14.3 +33 % % of revenue 17.0 % 20.2 %Current operating income 4.1 6.7 +61 % Operating income/(loss) 4.2 6.6 +60 % Consolidated net income/(loss) 5.2 6.0 +15 % % of revenue 8.2 % 8.4 %1 EBITDA (Earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization) corresponds to current operating income restated for (i) amortization  depreciation and provisions and (ii) income and expenses linked to share-based payments (see appendices)H1 2023 revenue: 71.0m€  up 12%Ekinops recorded H1 2023 consolidated revenue of €71.0m  up a solid +12% despite very challenging basis for comparison  with +25% growth posted in H1 2022. At constant exchange rates  half-year growth was also +12%.Growth was driven primarily by the +41% jump in Optical Transport equipment sales over the period  enabled by the success of WDM solutions and the appeal of OTN technology in the US and Europe. Access solutions sales fell by -5% over H1 2023 (vs. +21% a year earlier)  mainly due to lower sales in Asia-Pacific  but remained virtually stable in France and grew by +7% in EMEA. Software & Services business accounted for 14% of the Group's total revenues.Geographically  first-half revenue rose sharply by +42% in North America (identical in USD terms)  which now accounts for 26% of Ekinops' business. The EMEA region  which accounts for 39% of the Group's sales  posted growth of +13% at mid-year. Revenue in Asia-Pacific was down -65%  following +80% growth in the H1 2022. Lastly  in France  where the Group generated 34% of its H1 revenue  sales volumes were up +9% vs. H1 2022.Record high EBITDA1 margin of 20.2%H1 2023 gross margin stood at 37.7m€  up +13% Y-o-Y  despite a complex economic environment and heightened market competitiveness. Gross margin thus represented 53.1% of consolidated revenue in H1 2023 vs. 52.9% a year earlier and 53.0% end-2022.At mid-year  EBITDA came to 14.3m€  vs. 10.8m€ a year earlier  representing sustained growth of +33%. The rise in operating expenses was very well controlled (modest increase of +6% below the pace of revenue growth)  despite the investments necessary to accompany the Group's expansion and growth (net rise in headcount of +37 over the last 6 months  R&D equipment purchases and higher number of exhibitions and business travel).As such  H1 2023 EBITDA margin reached a record level of 20.2%  exceeding the 20% mark for the first time. EBITDA margin was 17.7% in 2022 and 16.9% in 2021.Adjusted EBIT of 14% in H1 2023After accounting for net depreciation  amortization and provisions (7.1m€  including 3.2m€ of amortization relating to post purchase price allocation technologies) and non-cash expenses relating to share-based payments (0.7m€)  current operating income came to 6.7m€ in H1 2023  up a strong +61% on the same period last year. Current operating margin therefore represents 9.4% of revenue vs. 6.5% in the year-earlier period. Excluding amortization of intangible assets identified post purchase price allocation  adjusted EBIT2 came to 14.0%  compared with 11.2% a year earlier.In the absence of other significant operating income and expenses  operating income rose by +60% to 6.6m€ in H1 2023  compared with 4.2m€ a year earlier.After taking into account financial expenses of 0.1m€ and a tax expense of 0.5m€  H1 2023 net income rose by 15% to 6m€  vs. 5.2m€ in H1 2022.Net margin for the semester was 8.4%  vs. 8.2% a year earlier.Net cash3 of 20.3m€ as of 30 June 2023The positive trend in Ekinops' operating indicators led to a +36% increase in cash flow  to 14.6m€.The increase in working capital requirements to +13.1m€ was mainly due to buoyant business at the end of H1 (+10.2m€ increase in accounts receivable). Operating cash flow therefore amounted to 0.9m€  vs. 2.2m€ in H1 2022.Cash flow from investments (non-current assets and R&D) amounted to a 4.4m€ outflow (vs. 2.8m€ in H1 2022) with 2.4m€ in equipment investments and 2.0m€ for capitalized R&D.Cash flow from financing activities totaled +11.7m€  including +10.6m€ in new bank loans contracted net of reimbursements over the period. This also included the 7.8m€ participatory recovery loan (Prêt Participatif de Relance - PPR)  which was cashed at the beginning of March 2023.Cash and cash equivalents totaled 47.6m€ as of 30 June 2023 (vs. 39.4m€ a year earlier)  for financial borrowings4 of 27.3m€.As such  Ekinops had a very solid financial position at the end of H1 2023 with net cash at 20.3m€ (vs. 19.3m€ a year earlier and €20.5m at end-2022)  and equity of €121.1m (up +7.5m€ from end-December 2022).At the close of the half-year period  Ekinops arranged a new 100m€ financing line with its banking partners  to provide the company with additional financial resources to support its development  in particular its acquisitions strategy  using non-dilutive financing methods5. The new financing consists of a confirmed 50m€ external growth loan (which may be increased to 90m€ under certain conditions) with a seven-year maturity  and a revolving loan of up to 10m€. These new financings will benefit from ESG targets that take into account Ekinops' Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) strategy.ASSETS - €m- IFRS 12/31 2022 06/30 2023LIABILITIES - €m- IFRS 12/31 2022 06/30 2023 Non-current assets 79.8 77.8Shareholders' equity 113.6 121.1 o/w goodwill 28.5 28.5Financial liabilities 18.9 27.3 o/w intangible assets 21.1 19.1o/w bank loans 14.5 20.7 o/w right-of-use assets 6.8 7.8o/w factoring 4.4 6.6 Current assets 63.5 77.2French research taxcredit pre-financing 2.6 6.8 o/w inventories 25.0 24.9Trade payables 17.7 16.5 o/w trade receivables 29.9 40.0Lease liabilities 6.9 8.0 Cash & cash equivalents 39.4 47.6Other liabilities 23.0 22.9 TOTAL 182.7 202.6TOTAL 182.7 202.6OutlookThe H1 2023 figures testify to a very good performance by Ekinops  with solid double-digit growth  despite a very demanding base effect  and record profitability  with EBITDA margin over 20% for the first time  and adjusted EBIT of 14.0%.In today's less buoyant market environment  with less visibility for H2 2023  Ekinops' priority is to intensify its hunting of new customers in all its geographies.At mid-year  2023 financial targets remain unchanged:revenue growth of over +12%  with a return to a more traditional seasonal pattern in H2;with a return to a more traditional seasonal pattern in H2; EBITDA margin between 15% and 19%.In terms of external growth  Ekinops maintains its ambition to complete a transaction during the year  favoring a non-dilutive source of financing.For more information  please refer to www.ekinops.comAll press releases are published after the close of trading on Euronext Paris.EKINOPS ContactDidier BrédyChairman and CEO[email protected]InvestorsMathieu OmnesInvestor relationTel.: +33 (0)1 53 67 36 92[email protected]PressAmaury DugastPress relationTel.: +33 (0)1 53 67 36 74[email protected][1] EBITDA (Earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization) corresponds to current operating income restated for (i) amortization  depreciation and provisions and (ii) income and expenses linked to share-based payments (see appendices).[2] Adjusted EBIT corresponds to current operating income adjusted for amortization charges related to intangible assets identified post purchase price allocation  i.e. developed technologies and customer relation.[3] Net cash = cash and cash equivalents – borrowings (excluding bank debt relating to R&D tax credit (CIR) pre-financing and IFRS 16 lease liabilities).[4] Financial debt excluding bank debt relating to R&D tax credit pre-financing and IFRS 16 lease liabilities.[5] See press release of 19 July 2023Photo - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2164138/Ekinops_H1_2023.jpgLogo - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/814911/Ekinops_Logo.jpgSOURCE Ekinops,neutral,0.06,0.93,0.01,positive,0.59,0.38,0.03,True,English,"['record high EBITDA margin', 'Ekinops H1 2023 EBITDA', 'Prêt Participatif de Relance', 'post purchase price allocation technologies', '7.8m€ participatory recovery loan', 'Optical Transport equipment sales', 'other significant operating income', 'R&D equipment purchases', 'Record high EBITDA1 margin', 'record high EBITDA margin', 'constant exchange rates', 'complex economic environment', 'working capital requirements', 'new bank loans', 'Current operating margin', 'Current operating income', 'half-year financial statements', 'solid financial position', 'The EMEA region', 'Access solutions sales', ""Ekinops' operating indicators"", 'Consolidated net income', 'H1 2023 financial statements', 'Operating cash flow', 'H1 2023 gross margin', 'H1 2023 EBITDA margin', 'H1 2023 net income', 'Ekinops H1 2023 EBITDA', 'record level', 'Net margin', 'current assets', 'equipment investments', 'financial borrowings4', 'solid +', 'lower sales', 'sales volumes', 'Operating expenses', 'telecommunications solutions', 'WDM solutions', 'Net cash3', 'financial expenses', 'leading supplier', 'telecom operators', 'statutory auditors', 'interim review', 'share-based payments', 'challenging basis', 'OTN technology', 'Services business', 'total revenues', 'North America', 'USD terms', 'market competitiveness', 'consolidated revenue', 'last 6 months', 'higher number', 'business travel', 'first time', 'strong +', 'intangible assets', 'tax expense', 'positive trend', 'buoyant business', 'accounts receivable', '4.4m€ outflow', 'financing activities', 'cash equivalents', 'half-year growth', ""Ekinops' business"", 'net rise', 'cash expenses', 'net depreciation', 'Euronext Paris', 'Change Revenue', 'first-half revenue', 'same period', 'year-earlier period', 'sustained growth', 'modest increase', 'H1 2023 revenue', 'H1 revenue', 'revenue growth', '1 EBITDA', '+25% growth', '+80% growth', '+36% increase', 'PRNewswire', 'enterprises', '30 June', 'Board', 'Directors', '26 July', 'PRNewsfoto/Ekinops', 'IFRS', 'Earnings', 'interest', 'taxes', 'amortization', 'provisions', 'appendices', 'comparison', '+41% jump', 'success', 'appeal', 'Europe', 'Asia-Pacific', 'France', 'Software', 'Group', 'mid-year', 'pace', 'expansion', 'headcount', 'exhibitions', '20% mark', '3.2m€', 'EBIT2', 'absence', '+10.2m€', 'reimbursements', 'PPR', 'beginning', 'March', '3.1', '20.', '2022', '4.2', '0.5', '2.4']",2023-07-27,2023-07-28,prnewswire.com

Our Location data and technology business has remained solid and has significantly grown year-over-year. This is despite the general market conditions  where major Tech companies announced massive layoffs and budget reductions  the ongoing conflict in Ukraine  the market volatility  the raising inflation and interest rates and the general concerns about a potential upcoming recession. GeoJunxion slightly exceeded the top end of the revenue guidance provided  with a revenue growth of 42% YOY.Location Intelligence Services for big Tech Companies performed very well  showing relevant growth year-over-year. We continue to be encouraged by the market interest in developing and keeping up to date our premium location aware products  in particular Eco Alert Zones (Environmental and Traffic Limited Zones) and Safety Alert Zones  such as School Streets and School Zones. All of them play a key role in our portfolio of geofences  accurate geolocated boundaries which can be utilized in a variety of use cases and market verticals. Within the Location Intelligence Services  the Indoor and Outdoor Venue Plans  now referred to as “Last Mile Mapping services”  are getting more and more traction  attracting the interest of clients like stadiums  museums  events and festivals  trade shows  municipalities and other public institutions.Our continued focus on cost control is paying off: for the full year 2022/23  operating expenses were flat compared with last year  despite the 42% revenue growth. This confirms a positive attitude of the Company over the course of the last two years. The increased revenues paired with cost control measures  resulted in positive financial KPIs such as EBITDA  EBIT  Net Profit and Cash Flow for the accounting year 2022/23. The positive cash flow from our business  were at a significantly increased level  compared with the past year. This despite the downpayments made on the COVID-related tax debt. This is a major accomplishment for the second year in a row  after years of ongoing negative cash flows.OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS AND STRATEGY UPDATEStrategy UpdateGeoJunxion’s strategy remains focused on creating “map agnostic” data products: digital geo-localized content  designed to be fully integrated into or overlaid on any commercial or open-source maps  or to be used in developing smart solutions for a large variety of use cases  in different industries and market sectors.Our strategy is solid as it has delivered year-over-year growth of +40% during the last 36 months. We will therefore continue to diligently execute on this strategy and expand the scope of our existing product portfolio and services.GeoJunxion’s activities are directed towards establishing long-term relationships with our customers  through the creation of recurring business models rather than opportunistic one-off contracts. Although the relationship with clients frequently starts with a proof-of-concept or a custom one-off project  most of the Company’s efforts go into building value-added  dynamic content  requiring continuous and frequent updates to maintain and increase their value over time. This means that most of our proof-of-concept and one-off projects are a launch-pad for establishing a service or license contract  converting the initial activities into a recurring  more predictable and sustainable business model.When executing projects  GeoJunxion typically retains the Intellectual Property and ownership of the newly developed datasets and solutions  for licensing to other customers. Thereby  leveraging the initial investment and creating a virtuous business cycle.Our mission remains focused on improving navigational safety and enhancing people mobility  contributing to a more sustainable world  reducing the impact on the environment  through intelligent solutions enabling more environmentally conscious decisions through informed choices.Central to GeoJunxion’s strategy are:Cost effective research  sourcing  production  ingestion  and aggregation of geodata;Offering flexible licensing models at competitive pricing;Direct delivery of dynamic  up-to-date content via APIs;Highly flexible solutions and content creation;Market DevelopmentsWhile existing and prospective clients strictly monitor their expenditures and continue to be prudent in contracting projects  we are experiencing a continuous growth of interest in our Location Intelligence Services and last-mile mapping.GeoJunxion has no direct impact from the ongoing war in Ukraine. Like other Companies however  we are impacted by rising inflation rates  caused by increased energy and other raw material prices and supply chain disruptions. This impacts salaries  staff expenses  office costs and other indirect services. However  we kept our OPEX costs under control due to diligent monitoring and continuous finetuning of our spending.We also remark on the interest in and demand for location-aware content despite the concerns about the health of the global economy. While many big Companies in the last 12 months made reductions in their respective workforces and cutting costs  GeoJunxion remained positive  strengthening the team in key departments  with focused hires necessary to drive growth and deliver strong results.The largest market opportunity for GeoJunxion remains by far with big Tech Companies  making extensive use of geo-localized data for their business and end-user solutions. In this market segment  we are dedicating a significant portion of our resources to project execution. We booked and executed sizable projects in all previous quarters  awarded project extensions and booked new opportunities also in the third and fourth quarter.We continue to invest in the automotive industry. Here we see a strong interest in cost-effective mapping solutions  with the most up-to-date and relevant content. This increased demand is also linked with the implementation of advanced driver-assistance systems  such as ISA (Intelligent Speed Assistance) and the adoption of geofences for safety and environmentally conscious action in-car. Premium content pertaining to road safety  environmental sustainability and social utility therefore remains a primary focus in our strategy and product development.GeoJunxion also remains active in identifying opportunities in other markets  such as Transport & Logistics  Real Estate  Geo-Marketing  Business Analysis  Travel & Tourism  as well as Public Administrations. In the last quarters  significant market efforts have been made in the Last Mile Mapping Services.Business DevelopmentIn the fourth and last quarter of FY 2022/23  as well as for the entire fiscal year  the Location Intelligence Services continued playing an essential role in our business development. The extension in scope of certain projects awarded during the year and winning new Projects and Proof-of-Concepts  gave us execution continuity in Operations and Research and Development. Some of those projects have been just completed in the fourth quarter of FY 2022/23.In May  we announced the closing of two new contracts with a global tech Company  for a total value exceeding EUR 200 thousand. The first agreement is a Location Intelligence Service in which GeoJunxion will collect  digitize and standardize geolocated data on a limited number of countries. This is expected to pave the way for future expansions of the geographic footprint  under the same project scope. The second contract is a recurring Data License Agreement  under which GeoJunxion will provide quarterly updates on data previously delivered. This is a perfect example of our Business Model and Company Strategy.Business Development has been also very much focused on developing new solutions for the last-mile mapping market. In order to reinforce our capability to deliver state-of-the-art last-mile mapping solutions  GeoJunxion established and nurtured the partnership with WizzyMaps during the last six months.During Q3 and Q4  our Sales and Business development teams attended more trade events in person. After the Autonomy Mobility World Expo in Paris in March  we also attended polisMobility in Cologne in May. This gave us the opportunity to meet with partners and clients face-to-face  to promote GeoJunxion’s brand  its products and services. To continue such a trend  we are already committed to attending IAA Mobility in Munich in September  at the RecreatieVakbeurs in Hardenberg and FestivakBelgië in Mechelen  both in November.Product DevelopmentCustom project executionWe continue to put significant efforts into the development of proprietary location intelligence content for a global Tech Company. The largest project  as announced in August ’22  has been extended in scope  and was completed in Q4 of FY 2022/23. Other projects for global Tech Companies were completed in Q4 of FY 2022/23. With the closing of two new contracts at the end of May  we secured additional work for our Operation Team for Q4 FY 2022/23 and for Q1 of the new FY 2023/24. One of these new contracts is a recurring activity and will be generating revenues for the years to come.Automotive product developmentOn the R&D side  most of the product development was focused on the execution and refinement of the data for a leading Infotainment System manufacturer. The first phase was completed and released  and we are currently working on delivering a second step  industrializing our process and regularly updating our content. This is expected to pave the way for growing in that market together with our client.Eco Alert Zones and School Safety ZonesSmart Geofences are key products in the GeoJunxion’s portfolio. Eco Alert Zones and School Safety Zones have been kept up to date during the course of the quarter. They are increasing in number  geographical coverage and also in the type of areas. School Streets are attracting more and more attention.We also continued investing in an innovative proof of concept project with the intent to develop deep learning methods in satellite imagery analysis and object recognition. This activity has continued during Q4 FY 2022/23 and delivered promising results. This will give us the possibility to further enrich our existing datasets of geofences and create new ones during the next FY 2023/24.ORDER INTAKEOrder intake continued in the positive trend. During the last quarter (Q4) of FY 2022/23  despite being slower than the other quarters  order intake increasedwith almost 52% compared with the same period of the past year. This resulted in the value of orders booked during the entire financial year 2022/23 to be more than double of those booked in the same period of the last accounting year.This is the end of an exceptionally good financial year  that brought positivity and satisfaction to the Sales and Business Development team and good results to the Company  supported by the diligent and tireless project execution by the technical departments.REVENUEDuring the entire FY 2022/23  total revenue increased by 42% compared to the same period of 2021/22. The growth has been realized in all our product lines  with recurring revenue growing by 10% and non-recurring revenue growing by approximately 63%.GeoJunxion tracks its revenue by product and service type and by the nature of the underlying contract (recurring versus non-recurring). The main revenue growth has been realized in non-recurring location services  but also the recurring revenue from licenses and royalties showed an increase. The recurring service revenue grew as well  in line with expectations and guidance provided at the end of the previous quarter. Recurring service revenue includes the updating services of our Eco Alert Zones product and other data products. The non-recurring service revenue includes tailored research  collection of data sets and the creation of geo-located content.ORGANIZATIONDuring the past quarter we added two new resources in Operations  to support the efforts in expanding recurring Location Intelligence Services. During the fourth quarter  GeoJunxion continued its attention to sensitive matters with social impact. GeoJunxion cares about its employees  their health  working conditions and encourages all of them to adopt a healthy lifestyle.FINANCIAL POSITIONGeoJunxion has made great progress in turning its business around from a digital map supplier to a premium location content and location intelligence service provider with subscription based  recurring “data as a service” revenue models. The results reported for FY 2022/23  with growing revenue  net profit  positive cash flow and positive KPIs for the accounting year  are evidence of this progress. Based on our current outlook  the available cash on hand is estimated to be sufficient to cover our operational requirements for at least the next 12 months. The cash at hand  is however not sufficient to repay the convertible loan  which contractually matures on 3 August 2023.EURONEXT DELISTING - STATUS UPDATEAs mentioned in the previous quarterly reports  we have had extensive discussions with OOB/PIE licensed auditing companies. In spite of the improved financial results  positive cash flows  improved governance & internal control processes  none of the auditing companies contacted was willing to provide a quotation for performing the audit work. The main reasons given by the auditing firms are the lack of internal staff capacity to execute the work and the limited size of the company and its market capitalization.As reported in our press release dated 14 April 2023  Euronext Amsterdam confirmed on 13 April 2023  its intention to proceed with a delisting. This is due to GeoJunxion’s ongoing non-compliance with respect to publishing audited annual accounts for the financial years 2019  2020 and 2021.GeoJunxion formally objected to this decision from Euronext on 25 April 2023. However  an additional letter was received from Euronext on 3 May 2023  confirming the delisting process  with the effective date of delisting scheduled for 6 November 2023. We are continuing to work on alternative solutions  exploring various possible paths  with the intent of securing a solid future for the Company  in the best interest of all stakeholders involved.It should be noted that the letter received from Euronext qualified as an event of default under the convertible loan agreement. As a result of this  the loan has become immediately due and payable to the lenders. However  we have received a suspension of rights letter  in which the lenders have suspended their enforcement rights under the convertible loan agreement. This suspension is valid for a limited period of time  during which we are discussing and negotiating alternative solutions.RISK MANAGEMENTRisk management is an integral managerial task. Our risk management and control procedures take into consideration the size of the company and the character of the business to identify the most significant risks which the company is exposed to. The risks identified are discussed on a periodical basis and mitigated or fully resolved  where possible. Such a system cannot provide absolute certainty that objectives will be realized. Neither can it guarantee prevention of potential cases of material mistakes  damage  fraud  or breaches of statutory laws.The 2021/22 Annual Report as published on 27 October 2022  describes the primary strategic  operational  and financial risks. The risks and uncertainties described in the Annual Report are relevant and are deemed incorporated and repeated by reference in this report. There were no cases of material damage  fraud or breaches of law detected since issuing the Annual Accounts. Our people are our key assets  and we do our utmost to keep them engaged  safe and healthy.GROUP STRUCTUREThe GeoJunxion group contains 2 entities: GeoJunxion N.V.

Our Location data and technology business has remained solid and has significantly grown year-over-year. This is despite the general market conditions  where major Tech companies announced massive layoffs and budget reductions  the ongoing conflict in Ukraine  the market volatility  the raising inflation and interest rates and the general concerns about a potential upcoming recession. GeoJunxion slightly exceeded the top end of the revenue guidance provided  with a revenue growth of 42% YOY.Location Intelligence Services for big Tech Companies performed very well  showing relevant growth year-over-year. We continue to be encouraged by the market interest in developing and keeping up to date our premium location aware products  in particular Eco Alert Zones (Environmental and Traffic Limited Zones) and Safety Alert Zones  such as School Streets and School Zones. All of them play a key role in our portfolio of geofences  accurate geolocated boundaries which can be utilized in a variety of use cases and market verticals. Within the Location Intelligence Services  the Indoor and Outdoor Venue Plans  now referred to as “Last Mile Mapping services”  are getting more and more traction  attracting the interest of clients like stadiums  museums  events and festivals  trade shows  municipalities and other public institutions.Our continued focus on cost control is paying off: for the full year 2022/23  operating expenses were flat compared with last year  despite the 42% revenue growth. This confirms a positive attitude of the Company over the course of the last two years. The increased revenues paired with cost control measures  resulted in positive financial KPIs such as EBITDA  EBIT  Net Profit and Cash Flow for the accounting year 2022/23. The positive cash flow from our business  were at a significantly increased level  compared with the past year. This despite the downpayments made on the COVID-related tax debt. This is a major accomplishment for the second year in a row  after years of ongoing negative cash flows.OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS AND STRATEGY UPDATEStrategy UpdateGeoJunxion’s strategy remains focused on creating “map agnostic” data products: digital geo-localized content  designed to be fully integrated into or overlaid on any commercial or open-source maps  or to be used in developing smart solutions for a large variety of use cases  in different industries and market sectors.Our strategy is solid as it has delivered year-over-year growth of +40% during the last 36 months. We will therefore continue to diligently execute on this strategy and expand the scope of our existing product portfolio and services.GeoJunxion’s activities are directed towards establishing long-term relationships with our customers  through the creation of recurring business models rather than opportunistic one-off contracts. Although the relationship with clients frequently starts with a proof-of-concept or a custom one-off project  most of the Company’s efforts go into building value-added  dynamic content  requiring continuous and frequent updates to maintain and increase their value over time. This means that most of our proof-of-concept and one-off projects are a launch-pad for establishing a service or license contract  converting the initial activities into a recurring  more predictable and sustainable business model.When executing projects  GeoJunxion typically retains the Intellectual Property and ownership of the newly developed datasets and solutions  for licensing to other customers. Thereby  leveraging the initial investment and creating a virtuous business cycle.Our mission remains focused on improving navigational safety and enhancing people mobility  contributing to a more sustainable world  reducing the impact on the environment  through intelligent solutions enabling more environmentally conscious decisions through informed choices.Central to GeoJunxion’s strategy are:Cost effective research  sourcing  production  ingestion  and aggregation of geodata;Offering flexible licensing models at competitive pricing;Direct delivery of dynamic  up-to-date content via APIs;Highly flexible solutions and content creation;Market DevelopmentsWhile existing and prospective clients strictly monitor their expenditures and continue to be prudent in contracting projects  we are experiencing a continuous growth of interest in our Location Intelligence Services and last-mile mapping.GeoJunxion has no direct impact from the ongoing war in Ukraine. Like other Companies however  we are impacted by rising inflation rates  caused by increased energy and other raw material prices and supply chain disruptions. This impacts salaries  staff expenses  office costs and other indirect services. However  we kept our OPEX costs under control due to diligent monitoring and continuous finetuning of our spending.We also remark on the interest in and demand for location-aware content despite the concerns about the health of the global economy. While many big Companies in the last 12 months made reductions in their respective workforces and cutting costs  GeoJunxion remained positive  strengthening the team in key departments  with focused hires necessary to drive growth and deliver strong results.The largest market opportunity for GeoJunxion remains by far with big Tech Companies  making extensive use of geo-localized data for their business and end-user solutions. In this market segment  we are dedicating a significant portion of our resources to project execution. We booked and executed sizable projects in all previous quarters  awarded project extensions and booked new opportunities also in the third and fourth quarter.We continue to invest in the automotive industry. Here we see a strong interest in cost-effective mapping solutions  with the most up-to-date and relevant content. This increased demand is also linked with the implementation of advanced driver-assistance systems  such as ISA (Intelligent Speed Assistance) and the adoption of geofences for safety and environmentally conscious action in-car. Premium content pertaining to road safety  environmental sustainability and social utility therefore remains a primary focus in our strategy and product development.GeoJunxion also remains active in identifying opportunities in other markets  such as Transport & Logistics  Real Estate  Geo-Marketing  Business Analysis  Travel & Tourism  as well as Public Administrations. In the last quarters  significant market efforts have been made in the Last Mile Mapping Services.Business DevelopmentIn the fourth and last quarter of FY 2022/23  as well as for the entire fiscal year  the Location Intelligence Services continued playing an essential role in our business development. The extension in scope of certain projects awarded during the year and winning new Projects and Proof-of-Concepts  gave us execution continuity in Operations and Research and Development. Some of those projects have been just completed in the fourth quarter of FY 2022/23.In May  we announced the closing of two new contracts with a global tech Company  for a total value exceeding EUR 200 thousand. The first agreement is a Location Intelligence Service in which GeoJunxion will collect  digitize and standardize geolocated data on a limited number of countries. This is expected to pave the way for future expansions of the geographic footprint  under the same project scope. The second contract is a recurring Data License Agreement  under which GeoJunxion will provide quarterly updates on data previously delivered. This is a perfect example of our Business Model and Company Strategy.Business Development has been also very much focused on developing new solutions for the last-mile mapping market. In order to reinforce our capability to deliver state-of-the-art last-mile mapping solutions  GeoJunxion established and nurtured the partnership with WizzyMaps during the last six months.During Q3 and Q4  our Sales and Business development teams attended more trade events in person. After the Autonomy Mobility World Expo in Paris in March  we also attended polisMobility in Cologne in May. This gave us the opportunity to meet with partners and clients face-to-face  to promote GeoJunxion’s brand  its products and services. To continue such a trend  we are already committed to attending IAA Mobility in Munich in September  at the Recreatie Vakbeurs in Hardenberg and Festivak België in Mechelen  both in November.Product DevelopmentCustom project executionWe continue to put significant efforts into the development of proprietary location intelligence content for a global Tech Company. The largest project  as announced in August ’22  has been extended in scope  and was completed in Q4 of FY 2022/23. Other projects for global Tech Companies were completed in Q4 of FY 2022/23. With the closing of two new contracts at the end of May  we secured additional work for our Operation Team for Q4 FY 2022/23 and for Q1 of the new FY 2023/24. One of these new contracts is a recurring activity and will be generating revenues for the years to come.Automotive product developmentOn the R&D side  most of the product development was focused on the execution and refinement of the data for a leading Infotainment System manufacturer. The first phase was completed and released  and we are currently working on delivering a second step  industrializing our process and regularly updating our content. This is expected to pave the way for growing in that market together with our client.Eco Alert Zones and School Safety ZonesSmart Geofences are key products in the GeoJunxion’s portfolio. Eco Alert Zones and School Safety Zones have been kept up to date during the course of the quarter. They are increasing in number  geographical coverage and also in the type of areas. School Streets are attracting more and more attention.We also continued investing in an innovative proof of concept project with the intent to develop deep learning methods in satellite imagery analysis and object recognition. This activity has continued during Q4 FY 2022/23 and delivered promising results. This will give us the possibility to further enrich our existing datasets of geofences and create new ones during the next FY 2023/24.ORDER INTAKEOrder intake continued in the positive trend. During the last quarter (Q4) of FY 2022/23  despite being slower than the other quarters  order intake increased with almost 52% compared with the same period of the past year. This resulted in the value of orders booked during the entire financial year 2022/23 to be more than double of those booked in the same period of the last accounting year.This is the end of an exceptionally good financial year  that brought positivity and satisfaction to the Sales and Business Development team and good results to the Company  supported by the diligent and tireless project execution by the technical departments.REVENUEDuring the entire FY 2022/23  total revenue increased by 42% compared to the same period of 2021/22. The growth has been realized in all our product lines  with recurring revenue growing by 10% and non-recurring revenue growing by approximately 63%.GeoJunxion tracks its revenue by product and service type and by the nature of the underlying contract (recurring versus non-recurring). The main revenue growth has been realized in non-recurring location services  but also the recurring revenue from licenses and royalties showed an increase. The recurring service revenue grew as well  in line with expectations and guidance provided at the end of the previous quarter. Recurring service revenue includes the updating services of our Eco Alert Zones product and other data products. The non-recurring service revenue includes tailored research  collection of data sets and the creation of geo-located content.ORGANIZATIONDuring the past quarter we added two new resources in Operations  to support the efforts in expanding recurring Location Intelligence Services. During the fourth quarter  GeoJunxion continued its attention to sensitive matters with social impact. GeoJunxion cares about its employees  their health  working conditions and encourages all of them to adopt a healthy lifestyle.FINANCIAL POSITIONGeoJunxion has made great progress in turning its business around from a digital map supplier to a premium location content and location intelligence service provider with subscription based  recurring “data as a service” revenue models. The results reported for FY 2022/23  with growing revenue  net profit  positive cash flow and positive KPIs for the accounting year  are evidence of this progress. Based on our current outlook  the available cash on hand is estimated to be sufficient to cover our operational requirements for at least the next 12 months. The cash at hand  is however not sufficient to repay the convertible loan  which contractually matures on 3 August 2023.EURONEXT DELISTING - STATUS UPDATEAs mentioned in the previous quarterly reports  we have had extensive discussions with OOB/PIE licensed auditing companies. In spite of the improved financial results  positive cash flows  improved governance & internal control processes  none of the auditing companies contacted was willing to provide a quotation for performing the audit work. The main reasons given by the auditing firms are the lack of internal staff capacity to execute the work and the limited size of the company and its market capitalization.As reported in our press release dated 14 April 2023  Euronext Amsterdam confirmed on 13 April 2023  its intention to proceed with a delisting. This is due to GeoJunxion’s ongoing non-compliance with respect to publishing audited annual accounts for the financial years 2019  2020 and 2021.GeoJunxion formally objected to this decision from Euronext on 25 April 2023. However  an additional letter was received from Euronext on 3 May 2023  confirming the delisting process  with the effective date of delisting scheduled for 6 November 2023. We are continuing to work on alternative solutions  exploring various possible paths  with the intent of securing a solid future for the Company  in the best interest of all stakeholders involved.It should be noted that the letter received from Euronext qualified as an event of default under the convertible loan agreement. As a result of this  the loan has become immediately due and payable to the lenders. However  we have received a suspension of rights letter  in which the lenders have suspended their enforcement rights under the convertible loan agreement. This suspension is valid for a limited period of time  during which we are discussing and negotiating alternative solutions.RISK MANAGEMENTRisk management is an integral managerial task. Our risk management and control procedures take into consideration the size of the company and the character of the business to identify the most significant risks which the company is exposed to. The risks identified are discussed on a periodical basis and mitigated or fully resolved  where possible. Such a system cannot provide absolute certainty that objectives will be realized.

This plant  designed to produce 10 000 tonnes of isobutene and derivatives per year (compared to 2 000 tonnes in the previous project)  will target the cosmetics market  followed by the sustainable aviation fuel market  for which Global Bioenergies has just obtained ASTM certification.Marc Delcourt  co-founder and CEO of Global Bioenergies  said: “We have delivered our first orders and our first-half revenue totalled €2.4 million. Guided by the current trend of a ramp-up in renewables  along with strong markets traction on the topic and technical progress regarding our direct path process  we are changing our roadmap. The commercial activities of the Pomacle unit  while generating sales but with a low associated margin  are no longer a priority. We are now focusing all our efforts on building this larger plant  scheduled to come on stream at the end of 2027. At the same time  we are already starting to deploy our technology in other regions and using other feedstocks alongside international industrial groups.”For L’Oréal  Global Bioenergies’ biggest shareholder via its BOLD (Business Opportunities for L’Oréal Development) investment fund  the plan for a large-capacity plant resonates with the environmental challenges and commitments taken as part of its L’Oréal for the Future programme. Ana Kljuic  Vice President R&I L’Oréal for the Future & Green Sciences  added: “Our commitment for 2030 is for 95% of the ingredients used in our formulas to be bio-sourced  derived from abundant minerals or from circular processes. This new ambition for Global Bioenergies will make bio-sourced isobutene derivatives accessible at competitive prices to cosmetics markets and  beyond that  will enable everyone to play an active part in the environmental transition.”Global Bioenergies will release design and construction schedules by the end of 2023.About GLOBAL BIOENERGIESThanks to its unique process  Global Bioenergies offers a renewable alternative to oil-based derivatives by producing chemical compounds from plant residues for use in many cutting-edge fields such as cosmetics and energy. These drop-in compounds have the same properties as oil-based products while improving carbon footprint and naturalness. Global Bioenergies’ sustainable aviation fuel technology is one of the very few ASTM-certified technologies that can be used in any commercial aircraft worldwide. The Company’s vision is to reduce CO 2 emissions in the aviation sector and thereby curb global warming.

Then the Company was unable to sign an agreement with an industrial partner to grant a license and continue the development of PXT864.This Alzheimer's research program had been partly financed by Bpifrance (ex-OSEO) within the DIPPAL collaborative project[2]  as a grant and a repayable advance. Repayment of this loan and payment of interest were based on commercialization of products resulting from the project (direct sales  licensing  development agreements) within 15 years of the last loan payment  i.e. by 2032.Thanks to an amicable agreement with Bpifrance  which waived the amount of the loan received  and released the Company from all its obligations on the DIPPAL project  Pharnext's liabilities will be reduced by 7.95 million euros.About PharnextPharnext is an advanced clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapies for neurodegenerative diseases currently without satisfactory therapeutic solutions. Pharnext has a first-in-class drug candidate  PXT3003  in development for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT1A)  a rare  debilitating  inherited peripheral neuropathy. PXT3003 benefits from orphan drug status in Europe and the United States. In 2018  PXT3003 completed a Phase III clinical trial  the PLEO-CMT trial  with encouraging topline results. This trial was followed by an open-label extension study  the PLEO-CMT-FU trial  with 120 patients continuing treatment with PXT3003. Long-term data suggest a sustained benefit  safety  and efficacy  after 5 years of total trial time.

Gross margin thus represented 53.1% of consolidated revenue in H1 2023 vs. 52.9% a year earlier and 53.0% end-2022.At mid-year  EBITDA came to 14.3m€  vs. 10.8m€ a year earlier  representing sustained growth of +33%. The rise in operating expenses was very well controlled (modest increase of +6% below the pace of revenue growth)  despite the investments necessary to accompany the Group's expansion and growth (net rise in headcount of +37 over the last 6 months  R&D equipment purchases and higher number of exhibitions and business travel).As such  H1 2023 EBITDA margin reached a record level of 20.2%  exceeding the 20% mark for the first time. EBITDA margin was 17.7% in 2022 and 16.9% in 2021.Adjusted EBIT of 14% in H1 2023After accounting for net depreciation  amortization and provisions (7.1m€  including 3.2m€ of amortization relating to post purchase price allocation technologies) and non-cash expenses relating to share-based payments (0.7m€)  current operating income came to 6.7m€ in H1 2023  up a strong +61% on the same period last year. Current operating margin therefore represents 9.4% of revenue vs. 6.5% in the year-earlier period. Excluding amortization of intangible assets identified post purchase price allocation  adjusted EBIT2 came to 14.0%  compared with 11.2% a year earlier.In the absence of other significant operating income and expenses  operating income rose by +60% to 6.6m€ in H1 2023  compared with 4.2m€ a year earlier.After taking into account financial expenses of 0.1m€ and a tax expense of 0.5m€  H1 2023 net income rose by 15% to 6m€  vs. 5.2m€ in H1 2022.Net margin for the semester was 8.4%  vs. 8.2% a year earlier.Net cash3 of 20.3m€ as of 30 June 2023The positive trend in Ekinops' operating indicators led to a +36% increase in cash flow  to 14.6m€.The increase in working capital requirements to +13.1m€ was mainly due to buoyant business at the end of H1 (+10.2m€ increase in accounts receivable). Operating cash flow therefore amounted to 0.9m€  vs. 2.2m€ in H1 2022.Cash flow from investments (non-current assets and R&D) amounted to a 4.4m€ outflow (vs. 2.8m€ in H1 2022) with 2.4m€ in equipment investments and 2.0m€ for capitalized R&D.Cash flow from financing activities totaled +11.7m€  including +10.6m€ in new bank loans contracted net of reimbursements over the period. This also included the 7.8m€ participatory recovery loan (Prêt Participatif de Relance - PPR)  which was cashed at the beginning of March 2023.Cash and cash equivalents totaled 47.6m€ as of 30 June 2023 (vs. 39.4m€ a year earlier)  for financial borrowings4 of 27.3m€.As such  Ekinops had a very solid financial position at the end of H1 2023 with net cash at 20.3m€ (vs. 19.3m€ a year earlier and €20.5m at end-2022)  and equity of €121.1m (up +7.5m€ from end-December 2022).At the close of the half-year period  Ekinops arranged a new 100m€ financing line with its banking partners  to provide the company with additional financial resources to support its development  in particular its acquisitions strategy  using non-dilutive financing methods5. The new financing consists of a confirmed 50m€ external growth loan (which may be increased to 90m€ under certain conditions) with a seven-year maturity  and a revolving loan of up to 10m€. These new financings will benefit from ESG targets that take into account Ekinops' Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) strategy.ASSETS - €m- IFRS 12/31 2022 06/30 2023LIABILITIES - €m- IFRS 12/31 2022 06/30 2023 Non-current assets 79.8 77.8Shareholders' equity 113.6 121.1 o/w goodwill 28.5 28.5Financial liabilities 18.9 27.3 o/w intangible assets 21.1 19.1o/w bank loans 14.5 20.7 o/w right-of-use assets 6.8 7.8o/w factoring 4.4 6.6 Current assets 63.5 77.2French research taxcredit pre-financing 2.6 6.8 o/w inventories 25.0 24.9Trade payables 17.7 16.5 o/w trade receivables 29.9 40.0Lease liabilities 6.9 8.0 Cash & cash equivalents 39.4 47.6Other liabilities 23.0 22.9 TOTAL 182.7 202.6TOTAL 182.7 202.6OutlookThe H1 2023 figures testify to a very good performance by Ekinops  with solid double-digit growth  despite a very demanding base effect  and record profitability  with EBITDA margin over 20% for the first time  and adjusted EBIT of 14.0%.In today's less buoyant market environment  with less visibility for H2 2023  Ekinops' priority is to intensify its hunting of new customers in all its geographies.At mid-year  2023 financial targets remain unchanged:revenue growth of over +12%  with a return to a more traditional seasonal pattern in H2;with a return to a more traditional seasonal pattern in H2;

Revenue growth among major retailers is therefore partly attributable to a proactive pricing revisions policy  the recovery in supplies following the disruptions (particularly for glass) of the first quarter with inventory replenishment in the second quarter among affected customers  and a competitive environment among major retailers which was favourable to certain brands of the Group.First half 2023 revenues for the France cluster came to €42.1m  up 5.0%.International clusterThe International cluster posted first half 2023 revenues of €56.7m  up 22.2% versus the first half of 2022 at constant exchange rates.

The British market  which remains challenging for the Marie Brizard brand  still recorded new listings across the Group’s brands  Sobieski in particular.Lithuania recorded revenue growth of 25.0% in the second quarter of 2023  particularly in the export brand business  mainly related to the increase in sales to the Ukrainian market. Domestic sales were stable compared with the first half of 2022.In Bulgaria  revenues continued to increase significantly in the second quarter of 2023 (up 25.2% versus 2022) following a sustained performance in the first quarter (up 50.2% versus Q1 2022). The increase in sales was mainly driven by export markets (particularly industrial subcontracting services).Revenues in Scandinavia fell 28.2% in the second quarter  from a record high in Q2 2022  which saw a sharp business recovery following the lifting of health restrictions earlier that year. This decline in revenues was also due to price elasticity impacting sales volumes following price increases  along with the tight competitive environment at the start of this year.In the Eastern European export markets  sales in Poland dropped significantly in the first half of the year compared to 2022  which was bolstered by the inventory build-up of the Gautier brand as part of its launch. It is worth noting the general market slowdown across all categories.In the United States  after a sharp drop in revenues in the first quarter of 2023  mainly due to inventory rundown by our local distributor and a low depletion trend following difficulties caused by the change in some routes to market in key states  sales in the second quarter were up 15.3% versus a sluggish Q2 2022  despite operational  logistical and commercial difficulties that impacted our brands’ performance.In line with the first quarter  Brazil posted solid revenue growth  driven mainly by local brands and the implementation of strict sales and pricing policies over the period.The Americas export market continued to be impacted by the significant revenue decline in Canada in the second quarter  at similar rates to that of the first quarter and for the same reasons: mainly the highly competitive vodka market and  more recently  an unfavourable Cognac market trend.Lastly  Asia Pacific revenues were down 6.4% in the second quarter of 2023  particularly in Australia  while Korea started to recover compared with Q2 2022.OutlookThe first quarter of 2023 showed that the rise in input costs remained significant and supply disruptions were still a reality  causing volumes to decline  particularly in France. The availability of materials and products somewhat improved recently  but remains highly unstable for some key products.It is worth recalling that at this stage  the price hikes intended to cushion increases in input costs since 2022 do not fully offset them  thereby weighing down on profitability.The Group continues to closely monitor the elasticity of consumer demand with respect to price increases and its impacts on certain product categories (particularly vodka and cognac) and is committed to maintaining its adaptability and operational focus  despite these challenges.International growth remains a priority for the Group’s development  even if the current economic climate enabled a buoyant second quarter performance in France  which is a more mature and concentrated market.The Group continues to implement its development strategies  namely expanding strategic brands internationally  strengthening its regional brands’ local positioning  growing our agency brand business and developing our industrial services offering.

Improving execution supported another strong performance from our growth platforms in Oncology and Neuroscience in the first half of the year  while I was particularly pleased with the Rare Disease progress of the pipeline  including another regulatory approval for Bylvay in the U.S.  positive clinical-trial results for elafibranor and a favorable regulatory step for palovarotene in the U.S. These developments have the potential to significantly benefit patients across a range of indications.The performance in the first half of the year is reflected in today’s upgrade to our full-year guidance. We look forward to more milestones and further expansion of the pipeline over time through additional external-innovation transactions. I am confident  as we continue to deliver more medicines to patients  in ensuring the sustainable growth of Ipsen.”Full-year 2023 guidanceIpsen has upgraded its financial guidance for FY 2023:Total-sales growth greater than 6.0%  at constant currency (prior guidance: greater than 4.0% at constant currency). Based on the average level of exchange rates in June 2023  an adverse impact on total sales of around 3% from currencies is expectedCore operating margin greater than 30.0% of total sales  excluding any potential impact of incremental investments from future external-innovation transactions (prior guidance: around 30%)Pipeline updateSeveral announcements regarding Ipsen’s pipeline were published in June 2023:The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted its supplemental New Drug Application for Onivyde plus 5 fluorouracil/leucovorin and oxaliplatin (the NALIRIFOX regimen) as a potential first-line treatment for metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date is13 February 202413 February 2024 The U.S. FDA approved Bylvay for the treatment of cholestatic pruritus in patients from 12 months of age with Alagille syndrome (ALGS). In July 2023  the European Medicine Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) issued a positive opinion recommending the approval of Bylvay for the treatment of cholestatic pruritus in patients with ALGS aged six months or older. The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (COMP)  a scientific committee of the EMA  concurrently issued a negative opinion for the maintenance of Bylvay’s orphan drug designation in ALGS. This latter opinion prevents the retention of orphan-drug status in Bylvay’s marketing authorization in ALGS and might delay a final European Commission decision. Ipsen plans to submit an appeal in respect of the COMP opinionThe U.S. FDA Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee voted in favor of investigational palovarotene as an effective treatment  with a positive risk-benefit profile  for people living with the ultra-rare bone disease  fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP). The PDUFA goal date is 16 August 2023. In May 2023  the CHMP confirmed the negative opinion on palovarotene as a potential treatment for FOP  and it was therefore not subsequently approved by the European CommissionPositive top-line data from the pivotal ELATIVE Phase III trial were published. In the trial  the efficacy and safety of elafibranor was assessed for the treatment of patients with the rare cholestatic liver disease  primary biliary cholangitis  who have an inadequate response or intolerance to the current standard of care therapy  ursodeoxycholic acid. The trial met its primary endpoint  and full trial data will be presented at a future scientific congressUpdate on Galderma partnershipIn July 2023  Ipsen notified Galderma of the termination of the July 2014 R&D collaboration related to the parties’ respective neurotoxin programs.Ipsen will retain all rights and obligations related to its early-stage R&D neurotoxin pipeline  including the development of IPN10200 (longer-acting neurotoxin).

Tolling Sale…,SLOWERFIRST HALF SALES IN 2023CONTRASTING PERFORMANCE BETWEEN ACTIVITIESBrussels  27 July 2023 (17.45) - COIL  world leader in the continuous anodising of aluminium in coil formg  announces sales of €11.8M for the first half of 2023  down 15.4% compared with the first half of 2022  which was boosted by exceptionally high demand. Tolling Sales were impacted by a challenging environment marked by a sharp slowdown in demand  while Package Sales registered solid growth driven by the turnaround in the European project business.Sales evolution by quarter and by activity(€M) 2023 2022 Variation Q1 6.41 6.61 - 3.1 % Q2 5.39 7.34 - 26.6 % Half-year total 11.80 13.95 - 15.4 % Of which Tolling Sales 9.28 11.68 - 20.6 % Package Sales1 2.52 2.27 + 11.1 %Tolling services: sharp slowdown in demandIn a difficult market environment  half-year tolling sales were €9.3M  down 20.6% compared with the first half of 2022. This represented 78.7% of total sales  compared with 83.8% the previous year. This decline was due to:i) an unfavourable basis of comparison with sales in the first half of 2022 (+18.5%) still boosted by the post-COVID-19 supply shortages ii) metal distributors' conservative expectations of market trends based on a sharply lower LME price of aluminium  leading them to maintain their inventories at minimum levels in the short term  andiii) the emergence of a new competitor in the European continuous anodising market.Package Sales:recovery in project businessHalf-year sales of Package Offers  in which the Company supplies continuous anodised aluminium directly to the end customer  came to €2.5M  up 11.1% on the previous year. This represented 21.3% of total sales  compared with 16.2% the previous year. This recovery in the Company's direct sales is mainly due to the increase in deliveries for high-end architectural projects in Europe. In addition  the Company has a solid pipeline of projects in Asia  which should translate into new orders by the end of the year.OutlookIn the short term  the decline in tolling activities and the product mix shift in favour of Package Offers will impact COIL's gross margin and results. To cope with this  the Company is optimising its operations by adjusting pricing in line with inflation  consolidating production on a limited number of lines and optimising its variable cost base.. The investments made over the past few years and the flexibility of its industrial facilities will allow the Company to respond effectively to an expected upturn in subcontracting markets later this year..In the medium and long term  the Company is confident in its development prospects  capitalising on its broad portfolio of premium  sustainable products with a lower carbon footprint  thereby boosting its business potential.Agenda31 October 2023 First half 2023 results and half-year financial report (after close of trading)About COILCOIL is the world's leading anodiser in the building and industrial sectors and trades under the ALOXIDE brand name.Anodising is an electrochemical process (electrolysis) which develops a natural  protective oxide layer on the surface of aluminium and can be coloured in a range of UV-proof finishes. It gives the metal excellent resistance to corrosion and/or reinforces its functional qualities. Anodising preserves all the natural and ecological properties of aluminium; it retains its high rigidity and excellent strength-to-weight ratio  its non-magnetic properties  its exceptional resistance to corrosion. The metal remains totally and repeatedly recyclable through simple re-melting. Anodised aluminium is used in a wide variety of industries and applications: architecture  design  manufacturing and the automotive sector.COIL deploys an industrial model that creates value by leveraging its unique know-how  its operational excellence  the quality of its investments and the expertise of its people. COIL has around 110 employees in Belgium and Germany and generated a turnover of €26 5 million in 2022.Listed on Euronext Growth Paris | Isin: BE0160342011 | Reuters: ALCOI.PA | Bloomberg: ALCOI: FPFor more information  please visit www.aloxide.comContactCOILTim Hutton | Chief Executive Officertim.hutton@coil.be | Tél. : +32 (0)11 88 01 88 CALYPTUSCyril Combecyril.combe@calyptus.net | Tél. : +33 (0)1 53 65 68 681Anodising and metal includedAttachment,neutral,0.02,0.97,0.01,mixed,0.3,0.21,0.49,True,English,"['2023 FIRST HALF SALES', 'COIL', 'natural, protective oxide layer', 'European continuous anodising market', 'COVID-19 supply shortages', 'lower LME price', 'variable cost base', 'premium, sustainable products', 'lower carbon footprint', 'ALOXIDE brand name', 'Chief Executive Officer', 'difficult market environment', 'half-year financial report', 'Euronext Growth Paris', 'European project business', 'high-end architectural projects', 'SLOWERFIRST HALF SALES', 'continuous anodised aluminium', 'half-year tolling sales', 'First half 2023 results', 'market trends', 'challenging environment', 'solid growth', 'Half-year total', 'Half-year sales', 'business potential', 'Tolling services', 'CONTRASTING PERFORMANCE', 'sharp slowdown', 'Package Sales', 'Sales evolution', 'total sales', 'unfavourable basis', 'conservative expectations', 'minimum levels', 'short term', 'new competitor', 'Package Offers', 'direct sales', 'solid pipeline', 'new orders', 'product mix', 'gross margin', 'limited number', 'industrial facilities', 'subcontracting markets', 'long term', 'development prospects', 'broad portfolio', 'leading anodiser', 'industrial sectors', 'electrochemical process', 'UV-proof finishes', 'excellent resistance', 'functional qualities', 'ecological properties', 'high rigidity', 'excellent strength', 'weight ratio', 'magnetic properties', 'exceptional resistance', 'simple re-melting', 'wide variety', 'automotive sector', 'industrial model', 'unique know-how', 'operational excellence', 'Tél', 'Cyril Combe', 'previous year', 'tolling activities', 'world leader', 'end customer', 'Tim Hutton', 'high demand', 'coil formg', 'Contact COIL', 'Brussels', 'turnaround', 'quarter', 'activity', 'Variation', 'decline', 'comparison', 'inventories', 'emergence', 'recovery', 'Company', 'increase', 'deliveries', 'addition', 'Asia', 'Outlook', 'operations', 'pricing', 'inflation', 'production', 'lines', 'investments', 'past', 'years', 'flexibility', 'upturn', 'medium', 'Agenda', 'October', 'close', 'trading', 'building', 'trades', 'electrolysis', 'surface', 'range', 'metal', 'corrosion', 'industries', 'applications', 'architecture', 'design', 'manufacturing', 'value', 'quality', 'expertise', 'people', '110 employees', 'Belgium', 'Germany', 'turnover', 'Reuters', 'ALCOI', 'Bloomberg', 'FP', 'information', 'CALYPTUS', '1Anodising', 'Attachment', '16.', '32']",2023-07-27,2023-07-28,marketscreener.com

Adjusted for Estetrol  this growth came to +35.3% (+35.0% at constant exchange rates)  mainly as a result of a strong activity at the Turku and Aramon sites  as well as higher demand for R&D services. Sales also benefited from the price increases implemented during the course of 2022.Fine Specialty ChemicalsNet sales of Specialty Fine Chemicals totaled €44.7 million  a 5.4% increase compared to 2022 (a 4.7% increase at constant exchange rates). Excluding sales of June 2022 of the Canadian subsidiary which was disposed at the beginning of June 2023  the increase is 11.0% (a 10.2% increase at constant exchange rates). Demand was generally good at the start of the year  with however a slowdown in the Lubricants business  offset by the dynamism of other activities and the effects of price increases implemented during the course of 2022.OutlookIn the context of the ongoing dispute with the customer Mithra  a temporary shutdown has been implemented during the second quarter of 2023 at the production site concerned  some of whose workshops are dedicated to the production of Estetrol. At this stage  it is still not possible to accurately assess the consequences of this dispute on future sales and earnings.The sale of the Group's Canadian subsidiary at the beginning of June 2023 enabled to repay part of Seqens' current account debt and generated a significant capital gain  enabling PCAS to rebuild its shareholders' equity and generate positive net income. However  the PCAS Group's current operating income is likely to remain in deficit  and as indicated in the press releases of March 30 and April 24  2023  the return to positive results  previously announced for 2023  has been postponed.PCAS Group will continue to benefit from the support of its majority shareholder Seqens (owning 76.66%) for the financing of its activities and its development.NEXT FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE:Results of the first semester 2023 –September 6  2023ABOUT PCASPCAS specializes in the development and production of complex molecules for life sciences and innovative technologies.

This press release follows on from the review and approval of the financial statements by MRM’s Board of Directors today.François Matray  Chief Executive Officer of MRM  said: “MRM benefited in full over the first six months from the effect of acquisitions made at the end of last year. Thanks to the integration of the Flins and Ollioules shopping centres  our rental income increased by 64%. Combined with the improvement in our operating profitability  this increase in our revenue allowed a 61% increase in net operating cash flow  despite the increase in the cost of financial debt as a result of higher interest rates and the bank loan contracted to finance acquisitions. In addition  the good level of the business performance is reflected in a further growth in retailer revenue and the signature of several new leases. We remain active in applying our asset management and value-enhancement skills across our enlarged portfolio  and we are confident in our ability to increase annualised net rents to above €16 million by 2025 at constant scope.”Good level of businessAt end-June 2023  retailer revenue4 in the MRM portfolio  including the Flins and Ollioules centres acquired at the end of 2022  was 5% higher than in the same period of the previous year. This came from a 1% increase in revenue from stores of over 500 sqm and a 9% increase for retailers in smaller units. This good performance can be compared with Procos data which reports an average increase for specialist retailers of 2 7% on a national level.The continued sustained rental activity led to the signature of 15 leases over the first half  representing annual rent of €1.0 million for total floor area of 9 000 sqm. The average reversion rate compared with market rental values was +5%.New leases notably include:• A lease for total floor area of 3 500 sqm  signed with Carrefour at Halles du Beffroi in Amiens: this retailer currently occupies floor area of 2 900 sqm  and plans to extend its store by 600 sqm by renting a vacant unit. This lease is still under the suspensive condition of final commercial approvals;• Three leases for total vacant floor area of 600 sqm at Passage du Palais  a city-centre shopping centre in the retail district of Tours: Fitness Record  Qipao and La Retoucherie will enhance the service offering at this centre  pushing the occupancy rate up to 93% from 85% six months earlier;• Lastly  the marketing of 500 sqm in the Flins regional shopping centre  marking the beginning of new ambitions for this site. As part of a works project under study  some lots have been placed into strategic vacancy.The physical occupancy rate rose to 92% at 30 June 2023 (from 90% six months earlier) whilst the financial occupancy rate was 90% (from 88% six months earlier)  the impact of the closure of struggling brands being more than offset by new leases. These figures take account of known departures and leases signed that had not yet come into effect at 30 June 2023 and exclude strategic vacancy (the exclusion of the units in question resulted in an increase in the physical and financial occupancy rates of 1 and 1.5 points respectively).At 1 July 2023  annualised net rents were €15.0 million taking into account leases signed that had not yet come into effect. This was an increase of 0.7% compared to €14.9 million5 at end-December 2022. This increase came from the combination of the positive effects of indexation (+€0.6 million) and leases signed that had not yet come into effect at 30 June 2023 (a further +€0.6 million)  partially offset by the impact of strategic vacancy (-€0.5 million)  higher non-recovered property expenses(-€0.2 million) and the balance of new leases and renewals net of departures over the first half(-€0.4 million).Change in portfolio valuePortfolio value was €245.4 million at 30 June 2023. The 0.2% increase reflects the positive effects of marketing and indexation which offsets the increase in the discount rate used by the expert appraisers (up 20 basis points on average).€m 30.06.2023 31.12.2022 Change Portfolio value excl. TT 245.4 244.9 +0.2%Financial ResultsFull effect of acquisitions on net rental income  up 89%Gross rental income rose sharply in the first half of 2023. It increased by 64.1% to €7.7 million. On a constant scope basis6  that is to say excluding the acquisition of the Flins and Ollioules shopping centres  the increase was 4.2% thanks to the letting of available floor area in the historic portfolio and the positive effects of indexation.After non-recovered property expenses  net rental income was €6.2 million  an 89.3% increase on the €3.3 million recorded in the first half of 2022.Rental income€m H1 2023 H1 2022 Change Change at constant scope6 Gross rental income 7.7 4.7 +64.1% +4.2% Non-recovered property expenses (1.5) (1.2) Non-recurring items7 - (0.2) Net rental income 6.2 3.3 +89.3%Net operating cash flow 8 up 61%Given the increase in net rental income and the better coverage of operating costs  which accounted for 25.8% of net rental income  from 39.7% in the first half of 2022  EBITDA increased by a factor of 2.2 to €4.4 million in the first half of 2023.The net cost of financial debt increased from €0.6 million in the first half of 2022 to €2.2 million in the first half of 2023. This change was the result of an increase in interest rates and of new bank loan in November 2022 which contributed to the financing of the acquisition of the Flins and Ollioules shopping centres.Net operating cash flow was thus €2.3 million  from €1.4 million in the first half of 2022  an increase of 61.0% or an increase in net operating cash flow per share of 9.7%.€m H1 2023 H1 2022 Change Net rental income 6.2 3.3 +88.3% Tenant support measures - 0.1 Operating expenses (1.6) (1.3) +23.0% Other operating income and expenses (0.2) (0.1) EBITDA 4.4 2.0 x2.2 Net cost of financial debt (2.2) (0.6) Net operating cash flow 2.3 1.4 +61.0%Solid financial position maintainedAt 30 June 2023  outstanding bank debt was €118.3 million  from €166.7 million at the end of 2022.The average cost of debt was 358 basis points in the first half of 2023  from 165 basis points a year earlier. MRM’s debt is fully remunerated at a variable rate and 76% is hedged by caps (with strike rates between 1% and 2.5%).MRM does not have any significant repayment dates before the end of 2028 and has a credit facility of €3.6 million available for development and CSR.At the end-June 2023  MRM had cash and cash equivalents of €5.7 million compared with €10.0 million at end-December 2022. The net LTV ratio remained under control  at 45.9% at end-June 2023 from 43.6% six months earlier.NAV at end-June 2023 was 0.7% higher than at end-December 2022 after restatement for pay-out to shareholdersEPRA NDV was €134.2 million at end-June 2023. This compares with €139.0 million six months earlier  or €133.2 million after the pay-out to shareholders of €5.8 million in respect to FY 2022. Restated for the pay-out  it thus rose by 0.7%  increasing from €41.6 per share at end-2022 to €41.9 per share at end-June 2023.OutlookIn 2023  MRM will benefit from the effect over a full year of the acquisition of the Flins and Ollioules centres  in terms of both rental income and operating profitability thanks to better coverage of fixed costs.On the strength of its expanded retail portfolio and its relationships with an increased number of retailers and brands  MRM intends to continue the dynamic management of its assets  focusing on the following priorities:• Development and implementation of programmes to enhance the value of its historic portfolio together with the two shopping centres acquired at the end of 2022;• Letting of available space;• Implementation of the Climate Plan and ESG action plan adopted by the company  paying particular attention to cutting energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with the trajectories proactively published in April 2023 in the Statement of Non-Financial Performance (Declaration of Extra-Financial Performance  DPEF in French);• Dynamic management of the property portfolio  looking at potential acquisitions and disposals.MRM confirms its target of annualised net rents of over €16 million by 2025.

In Asia  stock benchmarks advanced; the dollar weakened; Treasury yields continued to edge lower; while oil and gold futures rose.Equities:Stock futures point to gains at the open in Europe on Thursday  ahead of an expected quarter-point hike by the European Central Bank. A busy lineup of corporate earnings is also on the docket today.The ECB meeting comes after the Federal Reserve's 25-basis-point rate hike on Wednesday  in which officials took rates to their highest levels in 22 years but offered little in the way of guidance for future meetings.""We expect the ECB to continue with tough talk on Thursday  keeping the door open for another rate hike in September. But it will be tough talk but without any pre-commitment as in June "" said Carsten Brzeski  head of global macro at ING Research.The ECB's hawkish tone  however  could be tempered by recent data. Demand for business loans in the eurozone has hit its lowest level since the ECB started collecting data in 2003  according to a quarterly survey published Tuesday.""The bank will have an array of economic data  plus the latest staff projections by the time we get to the next meeting in mid-September. Markets currently see a 25 [basis point] hike at that meeting as a 50/50 bet "" said Jamie Dutta  an analyst at Vantage.Meanwhile  the U.S. indexes finished a volatile trading session mostly higher after wavering between gains and losses following the Fed decision.Futures markets are pricing in a 29% chance of an additional hike this year after Wednesday's meeting while also pricing in the first full rate cut for July 2024  according to CME FedWatch Tool.""Paradoxically  [Wednesday's] Fed meeting was one of the most certain and uncertain of the cycle "" said Gurpreet Gill  global fixed income macro strategist at Goldman Sachs Asset Management. ""However  investors remain divided on whether this marks the last increase in the current tightening campaign.""""We think recent data is consistent with the U.S. policy rate peaking in July  as core CPI inflation slowed sharply in June. But any renewed signs of inflation strength in key data like the Employment Cost Index released on Friday and upcoming PCE inflation releases still have potential to extend the hiking path "" she said.Robert Armstrong  investment strategist at Schroders  said Fed Chair Powell and other FOMC members had to be ""laser-focused"" to make sure they don't repeat the mistakes of the Arthur F. Burns regime  when in the 1970s the Fed eased up on interest rates too soon  so inflation came roaring back out of control. ""That's why Powell is very careful with his language at the press conference today "" Armstrong said.Read: Fed no longer sees a recession  and other things we learned from Powell's press conferenceForex:The dollar edges lower in Asia amid speculation that the Fed's rate-increase cycle may be over  which would undermine the appeal of U.S. fixed-income assets and demand for the dollar.The Fed's tightening cycle is likely now at an end  Commonwealth Bank of Australia said  noting that the FOMC raised rates as widely expected and said future rate hikes would be ""data dependent.""The markets seem to be broadly in agreement about the end of the Fed's tightening cycle  with only another 11 bps of tightening presently priced in  CBA added.Bonds:Treasury yields extended declines early Thursday after closing lower Wednesday on the Fed's 11th interest-rate increase since March 2022.Analysts said the decline in the policy-sensitive 2-year yield may reflect some skepticism about the Fed's ability to raise its policy rate again later this year  while the drop in longer-term Treasury rates pointed to prospects for depressed U.S. economic growth.During his press conference  Powell said policy makers remain strongly committed to bringing inflation down to their 2% target  and that ""the economy doesn't work for anyone"" without price stability. Though inflation has moderated since last year  the process of getting it to the Fed's target ""has a long way to go"" and is unlikely to happen until around 2025.Powell also said it will take time for the Fed's rate hikes to make their way through the economy  and that policy makers will make their decisions on a ""meeting-by-meeting"" basis. Nonetheless  he said it's ""certainly possible"" that the Fed could either hike or pause in September.Energy:Oil futures rose in Asia  rebounding from overnight declines and amid likely upcoming supply tightness.Looking ahead  ""the market is bracing for supply tightness  with a survey showing investors expected Saudi Arabia to extend cuts into September "" ANZ said.Meanwhile  CBA expects Brent oil futures will rise to $85/bbl by 4Q on expectations of OPEC+ supply cuts and resilient demand  which will force global oil stockpiles to fall.Still  CBA also thinks demand in affluent countries will ultimately weaken and this will weigh on prices in 1H 2024  driving prices to $75/bbl in 2Q.""Our view aligns with our forecast for the U.S. and some other advanced economies to enter a recession later this year "" said CBA analyst Vivek Dhar.""Given that refined products like petrol and diesel are non-discretionary for many end users  we think a slackening in the labor market will be key for oil demand to ease next year.""Metals:Gold futures rose early Thursday  extending overnight gains following the Fed's rate hike. Looking ahead  analysts expect the Fed to pause in September and ""when the market is confident that November will be a pause  then gold might break out higher "" said Oanda.Rate hikes ""tend to suppress gold prices in the near term "" as higher rates support the U.S. dollar  said Jerry Braakman  president and chief investment officer of First American Trust.Higher rates ""ultimately will increase the risk of recession by slowing economic activity in the U.S. "" said Braakman. In the medium term  ""we'll see a high probability of the economy either entering recession or being stuck in stagflation.""Gold ""does well in both scenarios "" he said.Read: Why gold prices climbed after the Fed's decision to raise interest rates-Copper rose amid hopes that the Fed's tightening cycle may be nearing an end  following its widely expected rate increase overnight.Also  China's recent Politburo meeting has set up an overall positive tone for base metals  Citi Research said.Citi expects some targeted measures from China in specific sectors  such as power grid infrastructure and energy transition-related fields. This could lead to growth in demand for copper and aluminum  Citi said.-Iron ore futures fell slightly in China  as the steelmaking commodity pulled back from earlier gains driven by Beijing's pledge to launch more policy stimulus.Analysts note a mixed bag of drivers for iron ore in the near term. Galaxy Futures said steel and iron ore demand could get a boost from the promise of measures to support domestic consumption in China and potential further easing in real-estate policies.But at the same time  iron-ore port inventories are rising as overseas supply picks up  which may weaken buying interest in iron ore futures  Galaxy said.TODAY'S TOP HEADLINESFederal Reserve Raises Interest Rates to 22-Year HighThe Federal Reserve resumed lifting interest rates Wednesday with a quarter-percentage-point increase that will bring them to a 22-year high.Fed Chair Jerome Powell said it was too soon to tell whether the hike would conclude a series of increases aimed at cooling the economy and bringing down inflation. The central bank would decide whether to keep lifting rates based on how the economy fares in the months ahead  ""with a particular focus on making progress on inflation "" he said at a news conference.The ECB Is Set to Follow the Fed With a Rate Hike. What Come's After Is Less Clear.With the European Central Bank projected to lift interest rates by a quarter-point on Thursday  attention will zero in on whether the central bank maintains a hawkish tone. That would indicate another rate hike is in store for September.The ECB's move will follow the U.S. Federal Reserve's quarter-point rate hike on Wednesday  in which officials took rates to their highest levels in 22 years but offered little in the way of guidance for future meetings.What Fed Hikes? Much of America's Consumer Debt Is Still Riding Ultralow RatesIn the depths of the pandemic  Alex and Cynthia Durbin refinanced their mortgage at 2.75%. They built up their savings by spending less  then paid off a car loan and student debt.That meant the family's balance sheet didn't take a hit when the Federal Reserve started aggressively raising interest rates last year in an effort to cool inflation. The Fed on Wednesday raised rates to a 22-year high  the 11th increase since March 2022. Though most things cost more now  the Durbins still have room in their budget to dine out with their three young children and go on vacation a few times a year.The Economy Has Defied Expectations.

In this announcement “Shell”  “Shell Group” and “Group” are sometimes used for convenience where references are made to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general. Likewise  the words “we”  “us” and our” are also used to refer to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general or to those who work for them. These terms are also used where no useful purpose is served by identifying the particular entity or entities. ‘‘Subsidiaries’’  “Shell subsidiaries” and “Shell companies” as used in this announcement refer to entities over which Shell plc either directly or indirectly has control. Entities and unincorporated arrangements over which Shell has joint control are generally referred to as “joint ventures” and “joint operations”  respectively. “Joint ventures” and “joint operations” are collectively referred to as “joint arrangements”. Entities over which Shell has significant influence but neither control nor joint control are referred to as “associates”. The term “Shell interest” is used for convenience to indicate the direct and/or indirect ownership interest held by Shell in an entity or unincorporated joint arrangement  after exclusion of all third-party interest.Forward-Looking StatementsThis announcement contains forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) concerning the financial condition  results of operations and businesses of Shell. All statements other than statements of historical fact are  or may be deemed to be  forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management’s current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking statements include  among other things  statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management’s expectations  beliefs  estimates  forecasts  projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as “aim”  “ambition”  ‘anticipate’’  ‘‘believe’’  ‘‘could’’  ‘‘estimate’’  ‘‘expect’’  ‘‘goals’’  ‘‘intend’’  ‘‘may’’  “milestones”  ‘‘objectives’’  ‘‘outlook’’  ‘‘plan’’  ‘‘probably’’  ‘‘project’’  ‘‘risks’’  “schedule”  ‘‘seek’’  ‘‘should’’  ‘‘target’’  ‘‘will’’ and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this announcement  including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell’s products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets  and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative  judicial  fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks  including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities  delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics  such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak; and (n) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this announcement are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc’s Form 20-F for the year ended December 31  2022 (available at www.shell.com/investor and www.sec.gov ). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this announcement and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement  July 27  2023. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information  future events or other information. In light of these risks  results could differ materially from those stated  implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this announcement.Shell’s net carbon intensityAlso  in this announcement we may refer to Shell’s “Net Carbon Intensity”  which includes Shell’s carbon emissions from the production of our energy products  our suppliers’ carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers’ carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the term Shell’s “Net Carbon Intensity” is for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.Shell’s net-Zero Emissions TargetShell’s operating plan  outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly  they reflect our Scope 1  Scope 2 and Net Carbon Intensity (NCI) targets over the next ten years. However  Shell’s operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target and 2035 NCI target  as these targets are currently outside our planning period. In the future  as society moves towards net-zero emissions  we expect Shell’s operating plans to reflect this movement. However  if society is not net zero in 2050  as of today  there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.Forward Looking Non-GAAP measuresThis announcement may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as cash capital expenditure and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell  such as oil and gas prices  interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover  estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc’s consolidated financial statements.The contents of websites referred to in this announcement do not form part of this announcement.We may have used certain terms  such as resources  in this announcement that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC.

Today  Lectra’s Board of Directors  chaired by Daniel Harari  reviewed the consolidated financial statements for the first half of 2023  which have been subject to a limited review by the Statutory Auditors.Comparisons between 2023 and 2022 are based on 2022 exchange rates unless otherwise stated (“like-for-like”). As the impact of the acquisition of TextileGenesis (see press release dated December 8  2022) on the financial statements for 2023 is not material  like-for-like changes exclude only the variations in exchange rates.Q2 2023Against the backdrop of slower global growth  the anticipation of a recession risk in certain countries  persistent inflation  and continuously rising interest rates  orders for perpetual software licenses  equipment and accompanying software  and non-recurring services (39.2 million euros) were down 27% compared to Q2 2022. The accelerating pace of sales in June brought Q2 2023 orders to 35.7 million euros  an 11% increase over Q1.Orders for new software subscriptions  of which the annual value came to 2.8 million euros  continued to rise  displaying a growth of 53% compared to Q2 2022  and 7% compared to Q1 2023.Q2 revenues (115.9 million euros) were down 8%.EBITDA before non-recurring items (15.6 million euros) decreased by 30% and EBITDA margin beforenon-recurring items came to 13.4%  down 4.4 percentage points.FIRST HALF 2023In the uncertain environment that characterized the first half of the year  as many companies continued their wait-and-see attitude  H1 orders for perpetual software licenses  equipment and accompanying software  and non-recurring services (74.8 million euros) were down 30% compared to H1 2022.The annual value of new software subscription orders came to 5.5 million euros  up 31%.Revenues came to 239.6 million euros  down 4% compared to H1 2022.While revenues from perpetual software licenses  equipment and accompanying software  and non-recurring services (79.5 million euros) were down 21%  recurring contract revenues (88.6 million euros)  which benefited from the growth in software subscription orders and the acceleration of synergies from the Gerber acquisition  increased by 11%. Revenues from consumables and parts (71.4 million euros) were up 2%.EBITDA before non-recurring items was 35.3 million euros  down 21% and the EBITDA margin before non-recurring items came to 14.7%  down 3.2 percentage pointsIncome from operations came to 23.0 million euros. This included a 6.3-million-euro charge for amortization of intangible assets arising from the acquisitions carried out since 2021 and a non-recurrent income item of 2.6 million euros.Net income (13.9 million euros) decreased by 31% at actual exchange rates.Free cash flow before non-recurring items came to 16.6 million euros (14.7 million euros in H1 2022). It is higher than net income.At June 30  2023  the Group had a particularly robust balance sheet with a consolidated shareholders’ equity of 406.4 million euros and a net financial debt of 4.6 million euros  consisting in financial debt of 99.1 million euros and cash of 94.5 million euros  after the payment in H1 of 15.2 million euros in respect of the acquisition of the majority of the capital of TextileGenesis  and 18.1 million euros in respect of dividends for fiscal year 2022.The working capital requirement at June 30  2023 was a negative 6.4 million euros.BUSINESS TRENDS AND OUTLOOKIn its 2022 Annual Financial Report  published February 8  2023  Lectra presented its new roadmap for 2023-2025. The Group also specified that 2023 remained unpredictable given the degraded macroeconomic and geopolitical environment  which lead to numerous uncertainties that could continue to weigh upon the investment decisions of its customers.At the beginning of the year  the Group had set itself objectives of achieving  in 2023  revenues in the range of 522 to 576 million euros and EBITDA before non-recurring items in the range of 90 to 113 million euros.Given the delay in orders for new systems in the first quarter  and poor visibility on new systems orders for subsequent quarters  the Group reported on April 27 that it now anticipated revenues in the range of 485 to 525 million euros (-5% to +3% at constant exchange rates relative to 2022) and EBITDA before non-recurring items in the range of 78 to 95 million euros (-15% to +3% at constant exchange rates relative to 2022). The Group also noted that despite limited visibility regarding new systems orders over the next few quarters  there is strong visibility regarding recurring revenues  which should enjoy substantial growth and account for 65% of total revenues in 2023. These revised scenarios had been prepared on the basis of the closing exchange rates on April 27  2023  for the remaining nine months of the year  and particularly $1.10/€1.The results of the second quarter support these revised objectives.A 1-cent appreciation of the euro against the U.S. dollar in the second half of the year (at an exchange rate of $1.10/€1) would mechanically decrease revenues by approximately 1.0 million euros and EBITDA before non-recurring items by 0.45 million euros. On the contrary  a 1-cent fall in the euro against the dollar would mechanically raise revenues and EBITDA before non-recurring items by the same amounts.Because the Group's customers operate in a highly competitive environment that demands they continue to improve performance  their investments will pick up as soon as the macroeconomic situation improves. Lectra's roadmap for 2023-2025  which was launched on January 1  2023  will enable the Group to take full advantage of the upturn and accelerate its growth.The 2022Annual Financial Report  as well as the Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations and the financial statements for H1 2023are available on lectra.com.

Net Result (23 5) (19 7)Jean-Baptiste Lucas  CEO of McPhy  says: “During this first semester of 2023  McPhy achieved several milestones on the road to becoming a key player in the hydrogen ecosystem in Europe and beyond.We signed our first significant contracts in the industrial sector  the biggest market for low-carbon hydrogen. Our industrial scale-up has accelerated with the automation of the stack assembly line in our San Miniato plant and the start of construction of our Gigafactory in Belfort. We have also begun our international development through a highly promising partnership with the Indian group Larsen & Toubro (L&T) and structured our policy regarding corporate social responsibility. Over the coming months  we will continue these actions while stepping-up our commercial penetration and strengthening our execution capabilities. The low-carbon hydrogen market is making gradual progress and must accelerate its growth to meet the targets set by major public and private operators. McPhy is leveraging all available means to make the most of this amazing opportunity”.Revenue within expected range and increase in the backlog2023 first-half revenue totaled €7.0 million  within the expected range of €6 to 8 million announced in April.It represents growth of 35% compared with the data published for the first half of 2022 and  remains stable compared with the 2022 figures restated for the takeover of two older generation stations. Although solid  the Group’s performance was nevertheless impacted by the postponement of the CEOG contract  one of the largest projects in which McPhy is a stakeholder. However  during the semester  the Group benefited from the contribution of contracts whose implementation has now begun  such as VEO-ArcelorMittal and HYPE.Sales are divided between the supply of electrolyzers  either large capacity McLyzer or from the Piel range (59%)  and the supply of stations (41%).The semester’s commercial momentum is illustrated by the first two major contracts won by McPhy in the industrial sector:McPhy is a stakeholder in an ambitious low-carbon steel project with ArcelorMittal and VEO   with the construction of an electrolysis pilot plant in Eisenhüttenstadt  Germany  in collaboration with the Brandenburg Technical University. McPhy will supply two McLyzer electrolyzers with an output of 1 MW each and will perform a 5-year service contract   with the construction of an electrolysis pilot plant in Eisenhüttenstadt  Germany  in collaboration with the Brandenburg Technical University. McPhy will supply two McLyzer electrolyzers with an output of 1 MW each and will perform a 5-year service contract  McPhy is also involved in a “green metal” project with the Plansee Group. McPhy will supply a McLyzer 800-30 electrolyzer that will be installed on Reutte site in Austria and will also provide long-term equipment maintenance services.Furthermore  the Group has signed an agreement with Indian conglomerate L&T whereby McPhy has granted an exclusive license for its pressurized alkaline electrolyzer technology for the manufacture of electrolyzers. L&T is planning to build a large-scale (Gigawatt) electrolyzer manufacturing plant in India based on McPhy’s technology to serve the needs of Indian domestic market  as well as selected geographical areas3. This partnership enables McPhy expansion beyond the European market  notably in India  a high-potential market whose low-carbon hydrogen production capacity should reach at least 5 million tons a year by 2030.Finally  these new references resulted in €10.9 million in firm orders in the first half of 2023 and took the backlog to €33.4 million at June 30  2023  an increase of 9% vs. December 31  2022.Operating result reflecting the Company’s ongoing developmentIn the first half of 2023  the Group pursued its strategy of commercial and industrial development. This led to a rise in current expenses linked to innovation and R&D expenditure on the one hand  and engineering resources for project and services on the other.Within this context  personnel expenses increased by 42%  reflecting the recruitment of 30 new employees during the semester (and 54 over the past 12 months)  bringing the workforce to 232 employees at June 30  2023. Other external expenses amounted to €12.9 million in first-half 2023  primarily to strengthen the Group’s industrial and technical expertise.As a result  EBITDA came to €(21.6) million  compared with €(17.1) million in the first half of 2022. The Operating Result was €(24.8) million  while the Financial Result improved substantially to €1.4 million thanks to the favorable impact of interest rate rises on cash investments. The Net Result was €(23.5) million in the first half of 2023 compared with €(19.7) million for the same period in 2022.Solid cash positionNet cash consumption was €(38.5) million in the first half of 2023  impacted by investments relating to the construction of the Gigafactory  and the increase in working capital requirements associated with the development of the Company’s activity. At June 30  2023  McPhy had a cash position of €97.0 million  compared to €135.5 million at December 31  2022  and thus has the financial leeway to continue implementing its projects.Implementation of a structured ESG policy and GovernanceAbout ESG  the Group is continuing to implement a structured policy to achieve the best standards  with the aim of obtaining a rigorous certification by 2025. The Group has already improved its MSCI rating from BBB to A4 in just one year.Moreover  the Board of Directors  now made of 8 members5  has set up a specific committee (the CSR Committee) to ensure that corporate social responsibility issues are considered when determining and implementing the Group’s strategy and activities.Post-closing eventsWithin the framework of the Djewels green hydrogen project 6   McPhy has signed a contract to supply Augmented McLyzer electrolyzers to the Delfzijl site in the Netherlands. The latter  with a capacity of 20 MW will be built by Technip Energies and operated by HyCC (which owns 100% of Djewels B.V.). With an annual production capacity of 3 000 tons of green hydrogen from renewable power and water  this is a large-scale and innovative project whose other stakeholder companies include Gasunie  DeNora and Hinicio.

Based on the information the Group is currently aware of  the CEOG project 7   which concerns the construction of the Western Guiana Power Plant  could resume shortly . However  the actual restart of the project should take several months.  which concerns the construction of the Western Guiana Power Plant  . However  the actual restart of the project should take several months. McPhy has also partnered with Dyneff8 to commission the first hydrogen refueling station on a highway in France. This new reference allows McPhy to position itself at the forefront of the nascent highway hydrogen mobility market  which is set to expand under the European Commission’s Repower EU plan.OutlookGiven its backlog and the time it takes to implement projects due to their size and complexity  McPhy anticipates double-digit annual revenue growth in 2023.The Group will continue its industrial investments  in particular the construction of its Gigafactory in Belfort for an estimated amount of €20 million in 2023  whose commissioning is still scheduled for the first half of 2024.The 2023 half-year financial report  including consolidated financial statements for the first half of 2023 and the auditors’ report on first-half financial information  can be found on the Company’s website ( www.mcphy-finance.com ).ABOUT MCPHYSpecialized in hydrogen production and distribution equipment  McPhy Energy is contributing to the global deployment of low-carbon hydrogen as a solution for the energy transition.

This partnership enables McPhy expansion beyond the European market  notably in India  a high-potential market whose low-carbon hydrogen production capacity should reach at least 5 million tons a year by 2030.Finally  these new references resulted in €10.9 million in firm orders in the first half of 2023 and took the backlog to €33.4 million at June 30  2023  an increase of 9% vs. December 31  2022.Operating result reflecting the Company’s ongoing developmentIn the first half of 2023  the Group pursued its strategy of commercial and industrial development. This led to a rise in current expenses linked to innovation and R&D expenditure on the one hand  and engineering resources for project and services on the other.Within this context  personnel expenses increased by 42%  reflecting the recruitment of 30 new employees during the semester (and 54 over the past 12 months)  bringing the workforce to 232 employees at June 30  2023. Other external expenses amounted to €12.9 million in first-half 2023  primarily to strengthen the Group’s industrial and technical expertise.As a result  EBITDA came to €(21.6) million  compared with €(17.1) million in the first half of 2022. The Operating Result was €(24.8) million  while the Financial Result improved substantially to €1.4 million thanks to the favorable impact of interest rate rises on cash investments. The Net Result was €(23.5) million in the first half of 2023 compared with €(19.7) million for the same period in 2022.Solid cash positionNet cash consumption was €(38.5) million in the first half of 2023  impacted by investments relating to the construction of the Gigafactory  and the increase in working capital requirements associated with the development of the Company’s activity. At June 30  2023  McPhy had a cash position of €97.0 million  compared to €135.5 million at December 31  2022  and thus has the financial leeway to continue implementing its projects.Implementation of a structured ESG policy and GovernanceAbout ESG  the Group is continuing to implement a structured policy to achieve the best standards  with the aim of obtaining a rigorous certification by 2025. The Group has already improved its MSCI rating from BBB to A4 in just one year.Moreover  the Board of Directors  now made of 8 members5  has set up a specific committee (the CSR Committee) to ensure that corporate social responsibility issues are considered when determining and implementing the Group’s strategy and activities.Post-closing eventsWithin the framework of the Djewels green hydrogen project 6   McPhy has signed a contract to supply Augmented McLyzer electrolyzers to the Delfzijl site in the Netherlands. The latter  with a capacity of 20 MW will be built by Technip Energies and operated by HyCC (which owns 100% of Djewels B.V.). With an annual production capacity of 3 000 tons of green hydrogen from renewable power and water  this is a large-scale and innovative project whose other stakeholder companies include Gasunie  DeNora and Hinicio.

R&D expenses for the first half of 2023 were up 81 % compared to the first half of 2022. This increase is in line with the clinical development activities planned in 2023.Net cash used in investing activities for the first half of 2023 amounted to (€7.7) million  compared to (€0.3) million in the first half of 2022. The change is mostly due to the change in deposits between both periods.Net cash used in financing activities for the first half of 2023 amounted to (€2.2) million  compared to net cash provided by financing activities of €14 million in the first half of 2022. The net cash generated in financing activities in 2022 was mainly driven by the equity raised through the Company’s At-The-Market Program for approximately €9.4 million (gross proceeds) in June 2022  and three loan agreements with a syndicate French banks for a total amount of €5.3 million entered into in the first half of 2022. In the first half of 2023  the net cash used in financing activities was mainly due to loan reimbursement and medical imaging equipment debt rents.Over the first half of 2023  the Company recorded a negative exchange rate effect on cash and cash equivalents of (€0.4) million  compared to a positive effect of €2.4 million for the first half of 2022  due to the evolution of EUR/USD exchange rate.Considering its current R&D and clinical development programs  the Company estimates that its existing cash  cash equivalents and deposits should allow the Company to fund its operations until the end of the fourth quarter of 20234.RevenuesThe Company’s revenues for the first half of 2023 amounted to €1.9 million  as compared to €0.1 million for the same period in 2022. The increase is mainly due to the receipt of the first regulatory milestone payment from CTTQ  Sino Biopharm’s subsidiary  which was received in July 2023. The milestone payment was triggered in May 2023 after CTTQ received the Investigational New Drug (“IND”) approval from the Chinese National Medical Products Administration (“NMPA”) to initiate the clinical development in mainland China of lanifibranor in NASH.***Business updatesInventiva announced positive topline results of the Phase II clinical trial conducted by Dr. Kenneth Cusi from the University of Florida  evaluating lanifibranor 800mg/daily in patients with NAFLD and T2D. Lanifibranor 800mg achieved the primary efficacy endpoint demonstrating a 44% reduction of hepatic fat measured by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy following 24 weeks of treatment in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). A significantly higher proportion of patients achieved a greater than 30% liver triglyceride reduction as well as NAFLD resolution with lanifibranor compared to placebo. Lanifibranor treatment significantly improved both hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity  which translated into better glycemic control. The study met multiple secondary metabolic endpoints confirming the cardiometabolic benefit of lanifibranor in patients with NAFLD  and ability to improve adipose tissue function. The study confirmed the favorable safety and tolerability profile of lanifibranor.Recruitment for our pivotal Phase III trial NATiV3 of lanifibranor in non-cirrhotic NASH continues with 389 sites activated in 23 countries  as of July 27  2023. The previously announced revised study design which limits the duration of the trial to 120 weeks instead of up to 7 years  reduces the number of biopsies from three to two  and includes a 48-week active treatment extension study  has been approved in 16 countries and approximately 70% of activated sites are currently operating under the revised design. This new patient friendly design is improving the patient enrollment rate which has doubled since implementation in sites where the revised design has been in place for more than 3 months. In addition  the screen failure rate has been improving since September 2022. In China  our partner CTTQ  after receiving the IND approval from the NMPA on May 22 2023  has opted to join NATiV3 and we are actively working with our partner to activate 50 sites in mainland China and 2 sites in Hong Kong.As of July 27  2023  the percentage of patients randomized and those having successfully met all recruitment criteria  is approximately of 50% of the planned enrollment in NATiV3 and we are targeting the last patient first visit by the end of the second half of 2023.Two Data and Safety Monitoring Board (“DSMB”) meetings have taken place  both with recommendations to continue the study without any modification to the protocol. Of note the safety profile is consistent with what was observed in previous clinical trials with lanifibranor.The baseline characteristics of the patients enrolled so far are aligned with expectations and the baseline characteristics of patients enrolled in the NATIVE Phase IIb trial. The main difference is a higher percentage of patients with T2D thus far in NATiV3 compared to NATIVE Phase IIb (58% vs 42% respectively). The effect size of lanifibranor therapy over placebo in the Phase IIb clinical trial on the composite endpoint ‘NASH resolution and fibrosis improvement’  which corresponds to the primary efficacy endpoint in the Phase III NATiV3 clinical trial  was higher in patients with T2D versus patients who did not have diabetes: 21% and 26% for lanifibranor 800 and 1200 mg/day  respectively  in patients with T2D versus 7% and 22%  respectively  in patients who did not have diabetes5.We are also continuing recruitment in the Phase II proof of concept clinical trial LEGEND  evaluating lanifibranor in combination with empagliflozin in patients with NASH and T2D. Recruitment of patients has been slower than expected and topline results are now targeted for the end of the first quarter of 2024 compared to the second half of 2023 as previously announced.Next key milestones expectedPublication of the topline results of the LEGEND Phase IIa combination trial of lanifibranor in combination with empagliflozin in patients with NASH and T2D – targeted for the end of the first quarter of 2024Last Patient First Visit of the NATiV3 Phase III clinical trial evaluating lanifibranor in NASH – targeted by the end of the second half of 2023Upcoming investor conference participationH.C.

R&D expenses for the first half of 2023 were up 81 % compared to the first half of 2022. This increase is in line with the clinical development activities planned in 2023.Net cash used in investing activities for the first half of 2023 amounted to (€7.7) million  compared to (€0.3) million in the first half of 2022. The change is mostly due to the change in deposits between both periods.Net cash used in financing activities for the first half of 2023 amounted to (€2.2) million  compared to net cash provided by financing activities of €14 million in the first half of 2022. The net cash generated in financing activities in 2022 was mainly driven by the equity raised through the Company’s At-The-Market Program for approximately €9.4 million (gross proceeds) in June 2022  and three loan agreements with a syndicate French banks for a total amount of €5.3 million entered into in the first half of 2022. In the first half of 2023  the net cash used in financing activities was mainly due to loan reimbursement and medical imaging equipment debt rents.Over the first half of 2023  the Company recorded a negative exchange rate effect on cash and cash equivalents of (€0.4) million  compared to a positive effect of €2.4 million for the first half of 2022  due to the evolution of EUR/USD exchange rate.Considering its current R&D and clinical development programs  the Company estimates that its existing cash  cash equivalents and deposits should allow the Company to funditsoperationsuntil theend of the fourth quarter of 20234.RevenuesThe Company’s revenues for the first half of 2023 amounted to €1.9 million  as compared to €0.1 million for the same period in 2022. The increase is mainly due to the receipt of the first regulatory milestone payment from CTTQ  Sino Biopharm’s subsidiary  which was received in July 2023. The milestone payment was triggered in May 2023 after CTTQ received the Investigational New Drug (“IND”) approval from the Chinese National Medical Products Administration (“NMPA”) to initiate the clinical development in mainland China of lanifibranor in NASH.***Business updatesInventiva announced positive topline results of the Phase II clinical trial conducted by Dr. Kenneth Cusi from the University of Florida  evaluating lanifibranor 800mg/daily in patients with NAFLD and T2D. Lanifibranor 800mg achieved the primary efficacy endpoint demonstrating a 44% reduction of hepatic fat measured by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy following 24 weeks of treatment in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). A significantly higher proportion of patients achieved a greater than 30% liver triglyceride reduction as well as NAFLD resolution with lanifibranor compared to placebo. Lanifibranor treatment significantly improved both hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity  which translated into better glycemic control. The study met multiple secondary metabolic endpoints confirming the cardiometabolic benefit of lanifibranor in patients with NAFLD  and ability to improve adipose tissue function. The study confirmed the favorable safety and tolerability profile of lanifibranor.Recruitment for our pivotal Phase III trial NATiV3 of lanifibranor in non-cirrhotic NASH continues with 389 sites activated in 23 countries  as of July 27  2023. The previously announced revised study design which limits the duration of the trial to 120 weeks instead of up to 7 years  reduces the number of biopsies from three to two  and includes a 48-week active treatment extension study  has been approved in 16 countries and approximately 70% of activated sites are currently operating under the revised design. This new patient friendly design is improving the patient enrollment rate which has doubled since implementation in sites where the revised design has been in place for more than 3 months. In addition  the screen failure rate has been improving since September 2022. In China  our partner CTTQ  after receiving the IND approval from the NMPA on May 22 2023  has opted to join NATiV3 and we are actively working with our partner to activate 50 sites in mainland China and 2 sites in Hong Kong.As of July 27  2023  the percentage of patients randomized and those having successfully met all recruitment criteria  is approximately of 50% of the planned enrollment in NATiV3 and we are targeting the last patient first visit by the end of the second half of 2023.Two Data and Safety Monitoring Board (“DSMB”) meetings have taken place  both with recommendations to continue the study without any modification to the protocol. Of note the safety profile is consistent with what was observed in previous clinical trials with lanifibranor.The baseline characteristics of the patients enrolled so far are aligned with expectations and the baseline characteristics of patients enrolled in the NATIVE Phase IIb trial. The main difference is a higher percentage of patients with T2D thus far in NATiV3 compared to NATIVE Phase IIb (58% vs 42% respectively). The effect size of lanifibranor therapy over placebo in the Phase IIb clinical trial on the composite endpoint ‘NASH resolution and fibrosis improvement’  which corresponds to the primary efficacy endpoint in the Phase III NATiV3 clinical trial  was higher in patients with T2D versus patients who did not have diabetes: 21% and 26% for lanifibranor 800 and 1200 mg/day  respectively  in patients with T2D versus 7% and 22%  respectively  in patients who did not have diabetes5.We are also continuing recruitment in the Phase II proof of concept clinical trial LEGEND  evaluating lanifibranor in combination with empagliflozin in patients with NASH and T2D. Recruitment of patients has been slower than expected and topline results are now targeted for the end of the first quarter of 2024 compared to the second half of 2023 as previously announced.Next key milestones expectedPublication of the topline results of the LEGEND Phase IIa combination trial of lanifibranor in combination with empagliflozin in patients with NASH and T2D – targeted for the end of the first quarter of 2024Last Patient First Visit of the NATiV3 Phase III clinical trial evaluating lanifibranor in NASH – targeted by the end of the second half of 2023Upcoming investor conference participationH.C.

Growth was particularly robust in the SiC semiconductor market. Aeronautics markets continued their recovery. The chemicals market was stable year on year. Lastly  as expected  the renewable energy market reported moderate growth compared with the very strong performance in first-half 2022.Electrical Power sales totaled €273 million in the first half  up by 19.5% on an organic basis. The process industries market saw solid growth  driven by electrical distribution in the United States and Europe. Sales for electric vehicles also rose steadily.In Europe  organic growth was 16.1%  driven by the good performance of the Electrical Power segment in France and Germany. In the Advanced Materials segment  aeronautics experienced robust growth  as did SiC semiconductors.In Asia  Group sales rose by 6.1% compared with the prior year. Momentum was strong in the chemicals market. In solar  as expected  growth was more modest after a record performance in 2022  while sales in the Electrical Power segment decreased in a less favorable economic environment in China.Lastly  sales in North America rose by 30.6%  with good momentum in both segments. Electrical distribution continued to deliver solid growth  fueled by prices and volumes. As expected  the semiconductor market was very buoyant  especially for SiC power semiconductors.EBITDA before non-recurring items grew by nearly 16% year-on-year to €100.5 million  representing 16.5% of sales  in line with first-half 2022 (16.6%).Depreciation and amortization amounted to €32 million  stable compared with first-half 2022 despite higher capital expenditure due to planned commissioning over the coming half-year periods.Group operating income before non-recurring items totaled €68.8 million in first-half 2023  resulting in an operating margin before non-recurring items of 11.3% of sales  up 80 basis points versus first-half 2022.The year-on-year increase was largely due to greater volumes and a high capacity utilization rate. Price increases and productivity plans during the period helped offset the higher cost of raw materials  energy and wages. These results also take into account additional costs related to the Group's growth projects  the ramp-up of the Columbia site  the Soitec partnership and the electric vehicle teams.Advanced Materials segmentEBITDA before non-recurring items for the Advanced Materials segment was €72.3 million  representing 21.6% of sales versus 22.6% in first-half 2022.Operating income before non-recurring items for the segment amounted to €50.4 million  resulting in an operating margin before non-recurring items of 15.1% of sales  in line with the same period in 2022. The favorable volume effect and price increases offset the higher cost of raw materials  energy and labor  as well as the cost of ramping up production at the Columbia site (United States) and the expense for the project with Soitec (SiC semiconductors).Electrical Power segmentEBITDA before non-recurring items for the Electrical Power segment was €38.4 million  representing 14.1% of sales versus 13.1% in first-half 2022.Segment operating income before non-recurring items amounted to €29.4 million  compared with €21.2 million in first-half 2022. This represents an operating margin before non-recurring items of 10.7% of sales  versus 9.1% in first-half 2022. The segment benefited from a favorable volume effect in the period. Price increases more than offset higher raw material and labor costs. The segment also continued to build up its dedicated team for the electric vehicle market over the period.Net income attributable to Mersen shareholders rose by more than 25% to €43.9 million in first-half 2023  from €35.1 million in first-half 2022.Net financial expense was €9 million  an increase from first-half 2022  due primarily to the steep rise in interest rates on variable-rate borrowings (30% of gross debt).The income tax expense was €13.6 million  corresponding to an effective tax rate of 22.8%  in line with 2022 (22.1%).Net income attributable to non-controlling interests (€2.2 million) essentially relates to Mersen Yantai (China) and Mersen Galaxy (China)  in which Mersen holds a 60% stake.The Group generated net cash from operating activities of €39.2 million  higher than the €5.3 million reported in first-half 2022  despite a €44.6 million negative change in working capital requirement amid robust business growth. The WCR ratio stood at 23% of sales  considerably lower than at June 30  2022 thanks to an increase in prepayments on contracts in the SiC semiconductor market. Inventories were intentionally high  to ensure a smooth start to deliveries as part of long-term contracts  particularly in the fields of semiconductors and electric vehicles  and more generally to secure certain supplies. In addition  the Group paid out substantial bonuses in the period for the very good performance achieved in 2022.Income tax paid represented an outlay of €15.4 million  up sharply year-on-year  as the Group benefited from accelerated tax depreciation in the United States in 2022 in connection with investments made at its Columbia site and  to a lesser extent  special payment terms in China related to the health crisis. The increase in tax paid also reflects earnings growth.In first-half 2023  capital expenditures totaled €61.7 million  in the context of the Group's medium-term growth plan. Almost 55% of the assets will be used for capacity increases as part of the Group's medium-term plan  including the expansion of materials finishing plants and the extension of a plant in France serving the electric vehicle market. 23% of this amount concerned the maintenance  upkeep and modernization of plants and equipment. The remaining amount concerns other growth projects and projects aimed at improving safety and the environment at Group sites.Investments in intangible assets are primarily related to the plan to digitize and modernize information systems and represented €4.8 million.On May 5  2023  the Group announced that it had successfully completed a capital increase with preferential subscription rights for an amount of approximately €100 million. The capital increase is designed to finance Mersen's 2027 growth plan and complement cash generated by the Group and undrawn credit facilities.Net debt at June 30  2023 stood at €189 million  down sharply compared with December 31  2022 (€241 million)  primarily reflecting the capital increase (net of costs) of €96 million completed in May 2023 and  conversely  the significant increase in capital expenditure as part of the Group's growth plan.The Group improved its financial structure over the period  with leverage of 0.98x (versus 1.36x at December 31  2022) and gearing of 23% (versus 33% at December 31  2022). No significant repayment milestones are expected before 2026.The Group's return on capital employed (ROCE) stood at 13.3% in first-half 2023  compared with 12.5% in 2022  in a favorable context of very significant utilization of existing production capacity.On the strength of its first-half 2023 results  the Group has revised its objectives upward and now expects for full-year 2023:organic growth of between 10% and 12% (versus 5% and 10% previously);operating margin before non-recurring items of between 11% and 11.2% of sales (versus between 10.5% and 11% previously);capital expenditure of between €150 million and €200 million (unchanged).These new objectives are based on the assumption of an equivalent or slightly deteriorated economic environment at the end of the year versus the current situation. The slower sales growth expected in the second half is mainly attributable to a high comparable base (growth in the second half of 2022 was much higher than in the first half). The margin objective also takes into account additional costs in the electric vehicle sector and greater depreciation due to equipment commissioning  which were already anticipated in the medium-term plan. Conversely  production ramp-up at the Columbia site (United States) is expected to boost the facility's profitability.The Group confirms the objectives of the medium-term plan presented in March 2023  i.e. by 2027  the Group is aiming for:sales of around €1.7 billion;operating margin before non-recurring items of 12% of sales. This margin may vary by +/-50 basis points;EBITDA margin before non-recurring items of 19% of sales. This margin may vary by +/-50 basis points;ROCE of 13%  which may vary by +/-50 basis points.---These interim consolidated financial statements were approved for issue by the Board of Directors on July 27  2023.The Group's results for first-half 2023 will be presented on July 28  2023 at 10:00 a.m. CET in a webcast and conference call (link here).

R&D expenses for the first half of 2023 were up 81 % compared to the first half of 2022. This increase is in line with the clinical development activities planned in 2023.Net cash used in investing activities for the first half of 2023 amounted to (€7.7) million  compared to (€0.3) million in the first half of 2022. The change is mostly due to the change in deposits between both periods.Net cash used in financing activities for the first half of 2023 amounted to (€2.2) million  compared to net cash provided by financing activities of €14 million in the first half of 2022. The net cash generated in financing activities in 2022 was mainly driven by the equity raised through the Company’s At-The-Market Program for approximately €9.4 million (gross proceeds) in June 2022  and three loan agreements with a syndicate French banks for a total amount of €5.3 million entered into in the first half of 2022. In the first half of 2023  the net cash used in financing activities was mainly due to loan reimbursement and medical imaging equipment debt rents.Over the first half of 2023  the Company recorded a negative exchange rate effect on cash and cash equivalents of (€0.4) million  compared to a positive effect of €2.4 million for the first half of 2022  due to the evolution of EUR/USD exchange rate.Considering its current R&D and clinical development programs  the Company estimates that its existing cash  cash equivalents and deposits should allow the Company to fund its operations until the end of the fourth quarter of 20234.RevenuesThe Company’s revenues for the first half of 2023 amounted to €1.9 million  as compared to €0.1 million for the same period in 2022. The increase is mainly due to the receipt of the first regulatory milestone payment from CTTQ  Sino Biopharm’s subsidiary  which was received in July 2023. The milestone payment was triggered in May 2023 after CTTQ received the Investigational New Drug (“IND”) approval from the Chinese National Medical Products Administration (“NMPA”) to initiate the clinical development in mainland China of lanifibranor in NASH.***Business updatesInventiva announced positive topline results of the Phase II clinical trial conducted by Dr. Kenneth Cusi from the University of Florida  evaluating lanifibranor 800mg/daily in patients with NAFLD and T2D. Lanifibranor 800mg achieved the primary efficacy endpoint demonstrating a 44% reduction of hepatic fat measured by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy following 24 weeks of treatment in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). A significantly higher proportion of patients achieved a greater than 30% liver triglyceride reduction as well as NAFLD resolution with lanifibranor compared to placebo. Lanifibranor treatment significantly improved both hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity  which translated into better glycemic control. The study met multiple secondary metabolic endpoints confirming the cardiometabolic benefit of lanifibranor in patients with NAFLD  and ability to improve adipose tissue function. The study confirmed the favorable safety and tolerability profile of lanifibranor.Recruitment for our pivotal Phase III trial NATiV3 of lanifibranor in non-cirrhotic NASH continues with 389 sites activated in 23 countries  as of July 27  2023. The previously announced revised study design which limits the duration of the trial to 120 weeks instead of up to 7 years  reduces the number of biopsies from three to two  and includes a 48-week active treatment extension study  has been approved in 16 countries and approximately 70% of activated sites are currently operating under the revised design. This new patient friendly design is improving the patient enrollment rate which has doubled since implementation in sites where the revised design has been in place for more than 3 months. In addition  the screen failure rate has been improving since September 2022. In China  our partner CTTQ  after receiving the IND approval from the NMPA on May 22 2023  has opted to join NATiV3 and we are actively working with our partner to activate 50 sites in mainland China and 2 sites in Hong Kong.As of July 27  2023  the percentage of patients randomized and those having successfully met all recruitment criteria  is approximately of 50% of the planned enrollment in NATiV3 and we are targeting the last patient first visit by the end of the second half of 2023.Two Data and Safety Monitoring Board (“DSMB”) meetings have taken place  both with recommendations to continue the study without any modification to the protocol. Of note the safety profile is consistent with what was observed in previous clinical trials with lanifibranor.The baseline characteristics of the patients enrolled so far are aligned with expectations and the baseline characteristics of patients enrolled in the NATIVE Phase IIb trial. The main difference is a higher percentage of patients with T2D thus far in NATiV3 compared to NATIVE Phase IIb (58% vs 42% respectively). The effect size of lanifibranor therapy over placebo in the Phase IIb clinical trial on the composite endpoint ‘NASH resolution and fibrosis improvement’  which corresponds to the primary efficacy endpoint in the Phase III NATiV3 clinical trial  was higher in patients with T2D versus patients who did not have diabetes: 21% and 26% for lanifibranor 800 and 1200 mg/day  respectively  in patients with T2D versus 7% and 22%  respectively  in patients who did not have diabetes5.We are also continuing recruitment in the Phase II proof of concept clinical trial LEGEND  evaluating lanifibranor in combination with empagliflozin in patients with NASH and T2D. Recruitment of patients has been slower than expected and topline results are now targeted for the end of the first quarter of 2024 compared to the second half of 2023 as previously announced.Next key milestones expectedPublication of the topline results of the LEGEND Phase IIa combination trial of lanifibranor in combination with empagliflozin in patients with NASH and T2D – targeted for the end of the first quarter of 2024Last Patient First Visit of the NATiV3 Phase III clinical trial evaluating lanifibranor in NASH – targeted by the end of the second half of 2023Upcoming investor conference participationH.C.

This performance has been driven by the strong growth of digital  the ongoing recovery of our transport activities and by the continued growth of street furniture  above pre-Covid revenue levels in H1.Digital Out of Home (DOOH) grew strongly at +17.1% in H1 2023  +18.0% on an organic basis  to reach 32.7% of Group revenue vs 30.0% in H1 2022. We maintained our focus on the selective roll-out of digital screens in prime locations  as well as on the development of our data capabilities. Programmatic advertising revenues through the VIOOH SSP (supply-side platform)  which constitute mostly incremental revenue from innovative dynamic data-driven campaigns and new advertisers  grew by +63 3% in H1 2023 to reach €36.9 million i.e. 7.1% of our digital revenue in half-year 2023 as the DOOH programmatic ecosystem  including Displayce following our strategic alliance announced in July 2022  continued to gain traction.By activity  Street Furniture grew by +3.8% organically in H1 2023 and was above H1 2019 levels globally; Billboard decreased by -0.5% organically in H1 2023  but was above 2019 in Asia-Pacific and North America; Transport grew at +19.0% reflecting the strong return of air travel already above 90% of pre-Covid level globally but remained significantly below 2019 revenue levels impacted by lower international air traffic in Asia and especially in China which is also affected by the non-renewal of the metro and airport contracts in Guangzhou.All geographies grew positively in H1 2023 including Asia-Pacific and Rest of the World growing double-digit on the back of the strong recovery of mobility in both regions. France  Rest of Europe and Rest of the World were close to 2019 revenue levels  while Asia remained still significantly behind mainly due to China.Our adjusted operating margin has improved by €19.6m to reach €203.1 million  representing a year-on-year increase of +10.7%. This positive operating leverage despite inflationary pressures on costs was driven by our street furniture division benefiting from both a full revenue recovery and some contract renegotiations while our transport and traditional billboard business are still affected by a slower pace of recovery especially in China. Our other P&L performance indicators improved accordingly including benefits from some contract renegotiations. Our free cash flow has been impacted by one-off deferred rental payments following the contract renegotiations  while we delivered positive operating cash flows of €114.3 million increasing by €33.6 million  +41.6% compared to H1 2022.Our growth strategy continues to be driven by both organic contract wins such as the largest OOH/DOOH media franchise in Norway and bolt-on acquisitions which included in Q2 the activities of Clear Channel in Italy and Spain.We have reaffirmed the excellence of our sustainable practices  recognized as best-in-class by extra-financial rating agencies  by launching in June our Climate Strategy “committed SBTi”  including targets to continue to reduce our carbon footprint across our entire value chain. This strategy is based on three principles: Measure  Reduce  Contribute. It aims for Net Zero Carbon by 2050 (scopes 1  2  and 3) and complements our ambitious 2030 ESG Strategy.As far as Q3 is concerned  we now expect an organic revenue growth rate at around +7% with China lagging behind the group average growth rate due the slow recovery of international air traffic and the impact of the non-renewals of our Guangzhou’s contracts.As the most digitised global OOH media company  with our new data-led audience targeting and programmatic solutions  our well diversified portfolio  our ability to win new contracts  the strength of our balance sheet  the high quality of our teams across the world and our recognised ESG excellence  we believe we are well positioned to benefit from the rebound. We are more than ever confident in the power of our media in an advertising landscape increasingly fragmented and more and more digital and in the role it will play to drive economic growth as well as positive changes.”Following the adoptions of IFRS 11 from January 1st  2014 and IFRS 16 from January 1st  2019  and in compliance with the AMF’s instructions  the operating data presented below are adjusted:- to include our prorata share in companies under joint control  regarding IFRS 11 - to exclude the impact of IFRS 16 on our core business lease agreements (lease agreements of locations for advertising structures excluding real estate and vehicle rental contracts).Please refer to the paragraph “Adjusted data” on page 5 of this release for the definition of adjusted data and reconciliation with IFRS.The values shown in the tables are generally expressed in millions of euros.

This positive operating leverage  despite inflationary pressures on costs  was driven by our street furniture division benefiting from both a full revenue recovery and some contract renegotiations while our transport and traditional billboard business are still affected by a slower pace of recovery especially in China. The adjusted operating margin as a percentage of revenue was 12.8%  +40bp above prior year.H1 2023 H1 2022 Change 23/22 €m % of revenue €m % of revenue Change (€m) Margin rate (bp) Street Furniture 172.6 21.0% 151.1 19.1% +21.5 +190bp Transport 21.4 4.0% 22.6 4.9% -1.2 -90pb Billboard 9.1 4.0% 9.9 4.4% -0.8 -40bp Total 203.1 12.8% 183.6 12.4% +19.6 +40bpStreet Furniture: In the first half of 2023  adjusted operating margin increased by €21.5 million to €172.6 million.

As a percentage of revenue  the adjusted operating margin was +4.0%  -90bp below prior year.Billboard: In the first half of 2023  adjusted operating margin decreased by €0.8 million to €9.1 million. As a percentage of revenue  the adjusted operating margin was +4.0%  -40bp below prior year.ADJUSTED EBIT (2)In the first half of 2023  adjusted EBIT before impairment charge improved by €30.4 million compared to the first half of 2022 (-€17.9 million) to €12.5 million. The positive variation is mainly due to the increase of the operating margin and to some positive one-off effects linked mainly to some street furniture contract renegotiations  partly offset by the impact of the end of the Guangzhou metro and airport contracts. As a percentage of revenue  EBIT margin improved by 200bp to 0.8%  from -1.2% in H1 2022  driven by a 450bp increase in Street Furniture margin  now at 7.4%.The impairment on tangible and intangible assets of +€21.9 million in H1 2023 is related to the reversal of the provisions for the Guangzhou contracts for €17.4 million.Adjusted EBIT  after impairment charge  has improved by €49.4 million from -€14.9 million in H1 2022 to €34.4 million in H1 2023.NET FINANCIAL INCOME / (LOSS) (3)In the first half of 2023  net financial income amounted to -€64.9 million  compared to -€67.7 million during the first half of 2022. This improvement of €2.8 million is mainly due to the net borrowing cost decrease of €6.9  partly offset by a €2.1 million unfavorable change in foreign exchange gains and losses and an increase of the net discounting charges of €1.2 million.The decrease in net borrowing costs was mainly due to the higher interest received on our cash deposits due to rising interest rates while financial costs are mainly at fixed rates partly offset by financial interest expenses relating to the €600 million bond with a maturity in 2029 placed in January 2023.EQUITY AFFILIATESIn the first half of 2023  the share of net profit from equity affiliates was €8.7 million compared to €7.1 million during the first half of 2022  an increase of 21.4% year-on-year reflecting the improvement in the overall operational performance of our affiliates under joint control  the contribution from our associates being down due to Clear Media in China which is still lagging behind and has not yet benefited from the mobility recovery.NET INCOME GROUP SHAREIn the first half of 2023  net income Group share before impairment charge increased by +€35.4 million to €21.8 million compared to -€13.5 million in H1 2022.Taking into account the net impact from the impairment charge  net income Group share increased by €49.6 million to €37.8 million compared to -€11.7 million in H1 2022.ADJUSTED CAPITAL EXPENDITUREIn the first half of 2023  adjusted net capex (acquisition of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets  net of disposals of assets) at €121.2 million remain below H1 2019 capex by 11.3%. This amount  which represents a decrease of €1.1 million (-0.9%) compared to H1 2022  includes €26.7 million of upfront payment for advertising rights related to the renewal and extension of our long-term partnership with Shanghai Metro and non-core asset sales for a total amount of €32.5 million.ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW (4)In the first half of 2023  operating cash flows reached €114.3 million improving by +€33.6 million compared to H1 2022  +41.6% year-on-year  mainly driven by the improving operating margin and by lower net financial interest paid over the period.Changes in working capital requirements had an unfavourable impact of €172.8 million due to the release of deferred rental payments over the period following some contract renegotiations and  to a lesser extent  an increase in receivables  and in inventory in line with the recovery of our activity.After capital expenditure  the adjusted free cash flow amounted to -€179.7 million  a decrease of €136.6 million vs H1 2022 attributable to the change in our working capital requirements  partly offset by the increase in our operating cash flows.DIVIDENDThe AGM held on May 16th  2023 decided not to distribute a dividend  in order to continue to optimize our financial flexibility and to reinforce our capacity to seize future organic and external bolt-on investment opportunities such as our recent acquisition of Clear Channel activities in Italy and Spain.NET DEBT (5)Net debt amounted to €1 168.3 million as of June 30th  2023 vs €975.0 million as of the end of December 2022  a €193.3 million increase mainly to the impact of the change in working capital requirements over the period on the free cash-flow. This net debt includes a strong liquidity with nearly €1.5 billion in cash and €825 million in confirmed revolving credit line  undrawn  with a maturity in mid-2026  and a well-secured debt profile with bond maturities largely covered by available cash until 2028 as well as an optimized management of our net debt allowing a reduction in financial expenses over the period.RIGHT-OF-USE & LEASE LIABILITIES IFRS 16Right-of-use IFRS 16 as of June 30th  2023 amounted to €2 445.3 million compared to €2 725.3 million as of December 31st  2022  a decrease of €280.0 million related to the amortisation of right-of-use  contracts renegotiations and foreign exchange rate impacts partially offset by new contracts  contracts extended and contracts renewed.IFRS 16 lease liabilities decreased by -€461.8 million from €3 412.1 million as of December 31st  2022 to €2 950.3 million as of June 30th  2023 (€3 684.8 million as of June 30th  2022). The decrease  mainly related to repayments of lease liability  a favourable impact from foreign exchange rates and renegotiations and terminations of contracts  is partly offset by new contracts and updates of minima guaranteed.ADJUSTED DATAUnder IFRS 11  applicable from January 1st  2014  companies under joint control are accounted for using the equity method.Under IFRS 16  applicable from January 1st  2019  a lease liability for contractual fixed rental payments is recognised on the balance sheet  against a right-of-use asset to be depreciated over the lease term. As regards P&L  the fixed rent expense is replaced by the depreciation of the right-of-use in EBIT  below the operating margin  and a lease interest expense on the lease liability in financial result  below EBIT. IFRS 16 has no impact on cash payments but payment of debt (principal) is booked in funds from financing activities.However  in order to reflect the business reality of the Group and the readability of our performance  our operating management reports used to monitor the activity  allocate resources and measure performance continue:To integrate on proportional basis operating data of the companies under joint control and;To exclude the IFRS 16 impact on our core business (lease agreements of locations for advertising structures excluding real estate and vehicle rental contracts).As regards the P&L  it concerns all aggregates down to the EBIT. As regards the cash flow statement  it concerns all aggregates down to the free cash flow.Consequently  pursuant to IFRS 8  Segment Reporting presented in the financial statements complies with the Group’s internal information  and the Group’s external financial communication therefore relies on this operating financial information. Financial information and comments are therefore based on “adjusted” data  consistent with historical data  which is reconciled with IFRS financial statements.In the first half of 2023  the impacts of IFRS 11 and IFRS 16 on our adjusted aggregates are:-€118.1 million for IFRS 11 on adjusted revenue (-€106.9 million for IFRS 11 in H1 2022) leaving IFRS revenue at €1 466.9 million (€1367.8 million in H1 2022).-€25.2 million for IFRS 11 and €346.4 million for IFRS 16 on adjusted operating margin(-€21.3 million for IFRS 11 and €387.6 million for IFRS 16 in H1 2022) leaving IFRS operating margin at €524.3 million (€549.9 million in H1 2022).(-€21.3 million for IFRS 11 and €387.6 million for IFRS 16 in H1 2022) leaving IFRS operating margin at €524.3 million (€549.9 million in H1 2022). -€16.0 million for IFRS 11 and €90.4 million for IFRS 16 on adjusted EBIT before impairment charge (-€12.7 million for IFRS 11 and €50.3 million for IFRS 16 in H1 2022) leaving IFRS EBIT before impairment charge at €86.8 million (€19.8 million in H1 2022).-€16.0 million for IFRS 11 and €90.0 million for IFRS 16 on adjusted EBIT after impairment charge (-€11.8 million for IFRS 11 and €50.3 million for IFRS 16 in H1 2022) leaving IFRS EBIT after impairment charge at €108.4 million (€23.6 million in H1 2022).-€6.4 million for IFRS 11 on adjusted capital expenditure (-€0.8 million for IFRS 11 in H1 2022) leaving IFRS capital expenditure at -€114.9 million (-€123.2 million in H1 2022).-€13.6 million for IFRS 11 and €400.8 million for IFRS 16 on adjusted free cash flow (€8.4 million for IFRS 11 and €313.6 million for IFRS 16 in H1 2022) leaving IFRS free cash flow at €207.4 million (€278.9 million in H1 2022).The full reconciliation between adjusted figures and IFRS figures is provided on page 10 of this release.NOTES(1) Operating Margin: Revenue less Direct Operating Expenses (excluding Maintenance spare parts) less SG&A expenses.(2) EBIT: Earnings Before Interests and Taxes = Operating Margin less Depreciation  amortization and provisions (net) less Impairment of goodwill less Maintenance spare parts less Other operating income and expenses.(3) Net financial income / (loss): Excluding the net impact of discounting and revaluation of debt on commitments to purchase minority interests (€0.7 million and -€1.2 million in H1 2023 and H1 2022 respectively).(4) Free cash flow: Net cash flow from operating activities less capital investments (property  plant and equipment and intangible assets) net of disposals.(5) Net debt: Debt net of managed cash less bank overdrafts  excluding the non-cash IAS 32 impact (debt on commitments to purchase minority interests)  including the non-cash IFRS 9 impact on both debt and hedging financial derivatives  and excluding IFRS 16 lease liabilities.ORGANIC GROWTH DEFINITIONThe Group’s organic growth corresponds to the adjusted revenue growth excluding foreign exchange impact and perimeter effect. The reference fiscal year remains unchanged regarding the reported figures  and the organic growth is calculated by converting the revenue of the current fiscal year at the average exchange rates of the previous year and taking into account the perimeter variations prorata temporis  but including revenue variations from the gains of new contracts and the losses of contracts previously held in our portfolio.€m Q1 Q2 H1 2022 adjusted revenue (a) 683.0 791.8 1 474.8 2023 IFRS revenue (b) 671.8 795.2 1 466.9 IFRS 11 impacts (c) 49.5 68.6 118.1 2023 adjusted revenue (d) = (b) + (c) 721.3 863.7 1 585.0 Currency impacts (e) 1.2 19.1 20.3 2023 adjusted revenue at 2022 exchange rates (f) = (d) + (e) 722.5 882 8 1 605.3 Change in scope (g) -5.7 -9.3 -15.0 2023 adjusted organic revenue (h) = (f) + (g) 716.8 873.6 1 590.3 Organic growth (i) = (h)/(a)-1 +5.0% +10.3% +7.8%€m Impact of currencyas of June 30th  2023 CNY 6.4 GBP 6.1 AUD 5.6 MXN -2.1 Others 4.3 Total 20.3Average exchange rate H1 2023 H1 2022 CNY 0.1335 0.1412 GBP 1.1411 1.1874 AUD 0.6252 0.6581 MXN 0.0509 0.0451Next information:Q3 2023 revenue: November 9th  2023 (after market)Key Figures for JCDecaux- 2022 revenue: €3 317m(a) – H1 2023 revenue: €1 585.0m (a)- N°1 Out-of-Home Media company worldwide- A daily audience of more than 850 million people in more than 80 countries- 1 040 132 advertising panels worldwide- Present in 3 573 cities with more than 10 000 inhabitants- 11 200 employees- JCDecaux is listed on the Eurolist of Euronext Paris and is part of the Euronext 100 and Euronext Family Business indexes- JCDecaux is recognised for its extra-financial performance in the FTSE4Good (3.4/5) CDP (A-)  MSCI (AA) and has achieved Platinum Medal status from EcoVadis- 1st Out-of-Home Media company to join the RE100- Leader in self-service bike rental scheme: pioneer in eco-friendly mobility- N°1 worldwide in street furniture (604 536 advertising panels)- N°1 worldwide in transport advertising with 153 airports and 205 contracts in metros  buses  trains and tramways (333 620 advertising panels)- N°1 in Europe for billboards (101 976 advertising panels worldwide)- N°1 in outdoor advertising in Europe (654 957 advertising panels)- N°1 in outdoor advertising in Asia-Pacific (170 973 advertising panels)- N°1 in outdoor advertising in Latin America (129 305 advertising panels)- N°1 in outdoor advertising in Africa (24 198 advertising panels)- N°1 in outdoor advertising in the Middle East (19 371 advertising panels)(a) Adjusted revenueFor more information about JCDecaux  please visit jcdecaux.com .Join us on Twitter   LinkedIn   Facebook   Instagram and YouTube .Forward looking statementsThis news release may contain some forward-looking statements.

This performance has been driven by the strong growth of digital  the ongoing recovery of our transport activities and by the continued growth of street furniture  above pre-Covid revenue levels in H1.Digital Out of Home (DOOH) grew strongly at +17.1% in H1 2023  +18.0% on an organic basis  to reach 32.7% of Group revenue vs 30.0% in H1 2022. We maintained our focus on the selective roll-out of digital screens in prime locations  as well as on the development of our data capabilities. Programmatic advertising revenues through the VIOOH SSP (supply-side platform)  which constitute mostly incremental revenue from innovative dynamic data-driven campaigns and new advertisers  grew by +63 3% in H1 2023 to reach €36.9 million i.e. 7.1% of our digital revenue in half-year 2023 as the DOOH programmatic ecosystem  including Displayce following our strategic alliance announced in July 2022  continued to gain traction.By activity  Street Furniture grew by +3.8% organically in H1 2023 and was above H1 2019 levels globally; Billboard decreased by -0.5% organically in H1 2023  but was above 2019 in Asia-Pacific and North America; Transport grew at +19.0% reflecting the strong return of air travel already above 90% of pre-Covid level globally but remained significantly below 2019 revenue levels impacted by lower international air traffic in Asia and especially in China which is also affected by the non-renewal of the metro and airport contracts in Guangzhou.All geographies grew positively in H1 2023 including Asia-Pacific and Rest of the World growing double-digit on the back of the strong recovery of mobility in both regions. France  Rest of Europe and Rest of the World were close to 2019 revenue levels  while Asia remained still significantly behind mainly due to China.Our adjusted operating margin has improved by €19.6m to reach €203.1 million  representing a year-on-year increase of +10.7%. This positive operating leverage despite inflationary pressures on costs was driven by our street furniture division benefiting from both a full revenue recovery and some contract renegotiations while our transport and traditional billboard business are still affected by a slower pace of recovery especially in China. Our other P&L performance indicators improved accordingly including benefits from some contract renegotiations. Our free cash flow has been impacted by one-off deferred rental payments following the contract renegotiations  while we delivered positive operating cash flows of €114.3 million increasing by €33.6 million  +41.6% compared to H1 2022.Our growth strategy continues to be driven by both organic contract wins such as the largest OOH/DOOH media franchise in Norway and bolt-on acquisitions which included in Q2 the activities of Clear Channel in Italy and Spain.We have reaffirmed the excellence of our sustainable practices  recognized as best-in-class by extra-financial rating agencies  by launching in June our Climate Strategy “committed SBTi”  including targets to continue to reduce our carbon footprint across our entire value chain. This strategy is based on three principles: Measure  Reduce  Contribute. It aims for Net Zero Carbon by 2050 (scopes 1  2  and 3) and complements our ambitious 2030 ESG Strategy.As far as Q3 is concerned  we now expect an organic revenue growth rate at around +7% with China lagging behind the group average growth rate due the slow recovery of international air traffic and the impact of the non-renewals of our Guangzhou’s contracts.As the most digitised global OOH media company  with our new data-led audience targeting and programmatic solutions  our well diversified portfolio  our ability to win new contracts  the strength of our balance sheet  the high quality of our teams across the world and our recognised ESG excellence  we believe we are well positioned to benefit from the rebound. We are more than ever confident in the power of our media in an advertising landscape increasingly fragmented and more and more digital and in the role it will play to drive economic growth as well as positive changes.”Following the adoptions of IFRS 11 from January 1st  2014 and IFRS 16 from January 1st  2019  and in compliance with the AMF’s instructions  the operating data presented below are adjusted:- to include our prorata share in companies under joint control  regarding IFRS 11 - to exclude the impact of IFRS 16 on our core business lease agreements (lease agreements of locations for advertising structures excluding real estate and vehicle rental contracts).Please refer to the paragraph “Adjusted data” on page 5 of this release for the definition of adjusted data and reconciliation with IFRS.The values shown in the tables are generally expressed in millions of euros. The sum of the rounded amounts or variations calculations may differ  albeit to an insignificant extent  from the reported values.ADJUSTED REVENUEAdjusted revenue for the six months ending June 30th  2023 increased by 7.5% to €1 585.0 million from €1 474.8 million in the same period last year.

Street furniture was above 2019 revenue levels globally including high-single digit above 2019 in Europe (including France and UK).First half adjusted advertising revenue  excluding revenue related to sale  rental and maintenance of street furniture were up +3.5% on an organic basis compared to the first half of 2022.In the second quarter  adjusted revenue increased by +3.7% to €458.3 million. On an organic basis  adjusted revenue increased by +3.5% compared to the same period last year. Street furniture was above 2019 revenue globally  thanks to Europe (including France and UK)  with UK significantly above the second quarter 2019 levels  driven by digital.In the second quarter  adjusted advertising revenue  excluding revenue related to sale  rental and maintenance of street furniture were up +3.2% on an organic basis compared to the second quarter 2022.TRANSPORTTransport was the main growth driver in H1 2023 as first half adjusted revenue increased by +16.9% to €536.7 million (+19.0% on an organic basis) reflecting the strong rebound of air travel standing at 92% of pre-Covid level globally with US and Middle-East airport advertising leading the pack  already above pre-Covid levels  and Europe and Asia-Pacific airport revenue levels increasing but lagging behind the air traffic pick-up.All geographies grew double-digit year-on-year but Transport remained significantly below 2019 revenue levels impacted by lower international air traffic especially in China. Rest of the World was already well above 2019 revenue levels.In the second quarter  adjusted revenue increased by +26.1% to €282.7 million. On an organic basis  adjusted revenue increased by +30.5% compared to the same period last year. Asia-Pacific was the fastest growing geography  but still significantly behind 2019  followed by North America and Rest of the World.BILLBOARDFirst half adjusted revenue decreased by -0.3% to €225.7 million (-0.5% on an organic basis). North America  Asia-Pacific  Rest of Europe and Rest of the World grew positively. Asia-Pacific and North America were above 2019 revenue levels.In the second quarter  adjusted revenue decreased by -2.5% to €122.7 million (-1.7% on an organic basis). North America recorded the strongest growth rate followed by Rest of the World  UK virtually flat while France was decreasing.ADJUSTED OPERATING MARGIN (1)For the first half of 2023  our adjusted operating margin has improved by €19.6 million to reach €203.1 million (vs €183.6 million in the first half of 2022)  a +10.7% increase year-on-year. This positive operating leverage  despite inflationary pressures on costs  was driven by our street furniture division benefiting from both a full revenue recovery and some contract renegotiations while our transport and traditional billboard business are still affected by a slower pace of recovery especially in China. The adjusted operating margin as a percentage of revenue was 12.8%  +40bp above prior year.H1 2023 H1 2022 Change 23/22 €m % of revenue €m % of revenue Change (€m) Margin rate (bp) Street Furniture 172.6 21.0% 151.1 19.1% +21.5 +190bp Transport 21.4 4.0% 22.6 4.9% -1.2 -90pb Billboard 9.1 4.0% 9.9 4.4% -0.8 -40bp Total 203.1 12.8% 183.6 12.4% +19.6 +40bpStreet Furniture: In the first half of 2023  adjusted operating margin increased by €21.5 million to €172.6 million. As a percentage of revenue  the adjusted operating margin was 21.0%  +190bp above prior year.Transport: In the first half of 2023  adjusted operating margin decreased by €1.2 million to €21.4 million. As a percentage of revenue  the adjusted operating margin was +4.0%  -90bp below prior year.Billboard: In the first half of 2023  adjusted operating margin decreased by €0.8 million to €9.1 million. As a percentage of revenue  the adjusted operating margin was +4.0%  -40bp below prior year.ADJUSTED EBIT (2)In the first half of 2023  adjusted EBIT before impairment charge improved by €30.4 million compared to the first half of 2022 (-€17.9 million) to €12.5 million. The positive variation is mainly due to the increase of the operating margin and to some positive one-off effects linked mainly to some street furniture contract renegotiations  partly offset by the impact of the end of the Guangzhou metro and airport contracts. As a percentage of revenue  EBIT margin improved by 200bp to 0.8%  from -1.2% in H1 2022  driven by a 450bp increase in Street Furniture margin  now at 7.4%.The impairment on tangible and intangible assets of +€21.9 million in H1 2023 is related to the reversal of the provisions for the Guangzhou contracts for €17.4 million.Adjusted EBIT  after impairment charge  has improved by €49.4 million from -€14.9 million in H1 2022 to €34.4 million in H1 2023.NET FINANCIAL INCOME / (LOSS) (3)In the first half of 2023  net financial income amounted to -€64.9 million  compared to -€67.7 million during the first half of 2022. This improvement of €2.8 million is mainly due to the net borrowing cost decrease of €6.9  partly offset by a €2.1 million unfavorable change in foreign exchange gains and losses and an increase of the net discounting charges of €1.2 million.The decrease in net borrowing costs was mainly due to the higher interest received on our cash deposits due to rising interest rates while financial costs are mainly at fixed rates partly offset by financial interest expenses relating to the €600 million bond with a maturity in 2029 placed in January 2023.EQUITY AFFILIATESIn the first half of 2023  the share of net profit from equity affiliates was €8.7 million compared to €7.1 million during the first half of 2022  an increase of 21.4% year-on-year reflecting the improvement in the overall operational performance of our affiliates under joint control  the contribution from our associates being down due to Clear Media in China which is still lagging behind and has not yet benefited from the mobility recovery.NET INCOME GROUP SHAREIn the first half of 2023  net income Group share before impairment charge increased by +€35.4 million to €21.8 million compared to -€13.5 million in H1 2022.Taking into account the net impact from the impairment charge  net income Group share increased by €49.6 million to €37.8 million compared to -€11.7 million in H1 2022.ADJUSTED CAPITAL EXPENDITUREIn the first half of 2023  adjusted net capex (acquisition of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets  net of disposals of assets) at €121.2 million remain below H1 2019 capex by 11.3%. This amount  which represents a decrease of €1.1 million (-0.9%) compared to H1 2022  includes €26.7 million of upfront payment for advertising rights related to the renewal and extension of our long-term partnership with Shanghai Metro and non-core asset sales for a total amount of €32.5 million.ADJUSTED FREE CASH FLOW (4)In the first half of 2023  operating cash flows reached €114.3 million improving by +€33.6 million compared to H1 2022  +41.6% year-on-year  mainly driven by the improving operating margin and by lower net financial interest paid over the period.Changes in working capital requirements had an unfavourable impact of €172.8 million due to the release of deferred rental payments over the period following some contract renegotiations and  to a lesser extent  an increase in receivables  and in inventory in line with the recovery of our activity.After capital expenditure  the adjusted free cash flow amounted to -€179.7 million  a decrease of €136.6 million vs H1 2022 attributable to the change in our working capital requirements  partly offset by the increase in our operating cash flows.DIVIDENDThe AGM held on May 16th  2023 decided not to distribute a dividend  in order to continue to optimize our financial flexibility and to reinforce our capacity to seize future organic and external bolt-on investment opportunities such as our recent acquisition of Clear Channel activities in Italy and Spain.NET DEBT (5)Net debt amounted to €1 168.3 million as of June 30th  2023 vs €975.0 million as of the end of December 2022  a €193.3 million increase mainly to the impact of the change in working capital requirements over the period on the free cash-flow. This net debt includes a strong liquidity with nearly €1.5 billion in cash and €825 million in confirmed revolving credit line  undrawn  with a maturity in mid-2026  and a well-secured debt profile with bond maturities largely covered by available cash until 2028 as well as an optimized management of our net debt allowing a reduction in financial expenses over the period.RIGHT-OF-USE & LEASE LIABILITIES IFRS 16Right-of-use IFRS 16 as of June 30th  2023 amounted to €2 445.3 million compared to €2 725.3 million as of December 31st  2022  a decrease of €280.0 million related to the amortisation of right-of-use  contracts renegotiations and foreign exchange rate impacts partially offset by new contracts  contracts extended and contracts renewed.IFRS 16 lease liabilities decreased by -€461.8 million from €3 412.1 million as of December 31st  2022 to €2 950.3 million as of June 30th  2023 (€3 684.8 million as of June 30th  2022). The decrease  mainly related to repayments of lease liability  a favourable impact from foreign exchange rates and renegotiations and terminations of contracts  is partly offset by new contracts and updates of minima guaranteed.ADJUSTED DATAUnder IFRS 11  applicable from January 1st  2014  companies under joint control are accounted for using the equity method.Under IFRS 16  applicable from January 1st  2019  a lease liability for contractual fixed rental payments is recognised on the balance sheet  against a right-of-use asset to be depreciated over the lease term. As regards P&L  the fixed rent expense is replaced by the depreciation of the right-of-use in EBIT  below the operating margin  and a lease interest expense on the lease liability in financial result  below EBIT. IFRS 16 has no impact on cash payments but payment of debt (principal) is booked in funds from financing activities.However  in order to reflect the business reality of the Group and the readability of our performance  our operating management reports used to monitor the activity  allocate resources and measure performance continue:To integrate on proportional basis operating data of the companies under joint control and;To exclude the IFRS 16 impact on our core business (lease agreements of locations for advertising structures excluding real estate and vehicle rental contracts).As regards the P&L  it concerns all aggregates down to the EBIT. As regards the cash flow statement  it concerns all aggregates down to the free cash flow.Consequently  pursuant to IFRS 8  Segment Reporting presented in the financial statements complies with the Group’s internal information  and the Group’s external financial communication therefore relies on this operating financial information. Financial information and comments are therefore based on “adjusted” data  consistent with historical data  which is reconciled with IFRS financial statements.In the first half of 2023  the impacts of IFRS 11 and IFRS 16 on our adjusted aggregates are:-€118.1 million for IFRS 11 on adjusted revenue (-€106.9 million for IFRS 11 in H1 2022) leaving IFRS revenue at €1 466.9 million (€1367.8 million in H1 2022).-€25.2 million for IFRS 11 and €346.4 million for IFRS 16 on adjusted operating margin(-€21.3 million for IFRS 11 and €387.6 million for IFRS 16 in H1 2022) leaving IFRS operating margin at €524.3 million (€549.9 million in H1 2022).(-€21.3 million for IFRS 11 and €387.6 million for IFRS 16 in H1 2022) leaving IFRS operating margin at €524.3 million (€549.9 million in H1 2022). -€16.0 million for IFRS 11 and €90.4 million for IFRS 16 on adjusted EBIT before impairment charge (-€12.7 million for IFRS 11 and €50.3 million for IFRS 16 in H1 2022) leaving IFRS EBIT before impairment charge at €86.8 million (€19.8 million in H1 2022).-€16.0 million for IFRS 11 and €90.0 million for IFRS 16 on adjusted EBIT after impairment charge (-€11.8 million for IFRS 11 and €50.3 million for IFRS 16 in H1 2022) leaving IFRS EBIT after impairment charge at €108.4 million (€23.6 million in H1 2022).-€6.4 million for IFRS 11 on adjusted capital expenditure (-€0.8 million for IFRS 11 in H1 2022) leaving IFRS capital expenditure at -€114.9 million (-€123.2 million in H1 2022).-€13.6 million for IFRS 11 and €400.8 million for IFRS 16 on adjusted free cash flow (€8.4 million for IFRS 11 and €313.6 million for IFRS 16 in H1 2022) leaving IFRS free cash flow at €207.4 million (€278.9 million in H1 2022).The full reconciliation between adjusted figures and IFRS figures is provided on page 10 of this release.NOTES(1) Operating Margin: Revenue less Direct Operating Expenses (excluding Maintenance spare parts) less SG&A expenses.(2) EBIT: Earnings Before Interests and Taxes = Operating Margin less Depreciation  amortization and provisions (net) less Impairment of goodwill less Maintenance spare parts less Other operating income and expenses.(3) Net financial income / (loss): Excluding the net impact of discounting and revaluation of debt on commitments to purchase minority interests (€0.7 million and -€1.2 million in H1 2023 and H1 2022 respectively).(4) Free cash flow: Net cash flow from operating activities less capital investments (property  plant and equipment and intangible assets) net of disposals.(5) Net debt: Debt net of managed cash less bank overdrafts  excluding the non-cash IAS 32 impact (debt on commitments to purchase minority interests)  including the non-cash IFRS 9 impact on both debt and hedging financial derivatives  and excluding IFRS 16 lease liabilities.ORGANIC GROWTH DEFINITIONThe Group’s organic growth corresponds to the adjusted revenue growth excluding foreign exchange impact and perimeter effect. The reference fiscal year remains unchanged regarding the reported figures  and the organic growth is calculated by converting the revenue of the current fiscal year at the average exchange rates of the previous year and taking into account the perimeter variations prorata temporis  but including revenue variations from the gains of new contracts and the losses of contracts previously held in our portfolio.€m Q1 Q2 H1 2022 adjusted revenue (a) 683.0 791.8 1 474.8 2023 IFRS revenue (b) 671.8 795.2 1 466.9 IFRS 11 impacts (c) 49.5 68.6 118.1 2023 adjusted revenue (d) = (b) + (c) 721.3 863.7 1 585.0 Currency impacts (e) 1.2 19.1 20.3 2023 adjusted revenue at 2022 exchange rates (f) = (d) + (e) 722.5 882 8 1 605.3 Change in scope (g) -5.7 -9.3 -15.0 2023 adjusted organic revenue (h) = (f) + (g) 716.8 873.6 1 590.3 Organic growth (i) = (h)/(a)-1 +5.0% +10.3% +7.8%€m Impact of currencyas of June 30th  2023 CNY 6.4 GBP 6.1 AUD 5.6 MXN -2.1 Others 4.3 Total 20.3Average exchange rate H1 2023 H1 2022 CNY 0.1335 0.1412 GBP 1.1411 1.1874 AUD 0.6252 0.6581 MXN 0.0509 0.0451Next information:Q3 2023 revenue: November 9th  2023 (after market)Key Figures for JCDecaux- 2022 revenue: €3 317m(a)– H1 2023 revenue: €1 585.0m(a)- N°1 Out-of-Home Media company worldwide- A daily audience of more than 850 million people in more than 80 countries- 1 040 132 advertising panels worldwide- Present in 3 573 cities with more than 10 000 inhabitants- 11 200 employees- JCDecaux is listed on the Eurolist of Euronext Paris and is part of the Euronext 100 and Euronext Family Business indexes- JCDecaux is recognised for its extra-financial performance in the FTSE4Good (3.4/5) CDP (A-)  MSCI (AA) and has achieved Platinum Medal status from EcoVadis- 1st Out-of-Home Media company to join the RE100- Leader in self-service bike rental scheme: pioneer in eco-friendly mobility- N°1 worldwide in street furniture (604 536 advertising panels)- N°1 worldwide in transport advertising with 153 airports and 205 contracts in metros  buses  trains and tramways (333 620 advertising panels)- N°1 in Europe for billboards (101 976 advertising panels worldwide)- N°1 in outdoor advertising in Europe (654 957 advertising panels)- N°1 in outdoor advertising in Asia-Pacific (170 973 advertising panels)- N°1 in outdoor advertising in Latin America (129 305 advertising panels)- N°1 in outdoor advertising in Africa (24 198 advertising panels)- N°1 in outdoor advertising in the Middle East (19 371 advertising panels)(a) Adjusted revenueFor more information about JCDecaux  please visit jcdecaux.com .Join us on Twitter   LinkedIn   Facebook   Instagram and YouTube .Forward looking statementsThis news release may contain some forward-looking statements.

These results have been approved by the Board of Directors today and limited review procedures on the consolidated financial statements have been carried out.Vantiva's results for the first half of 2023 are in line with the Group's expectations  but as anticipated down on last year. The decline stems mainly from weaker activity in both divisions due to less favorable economic conditions and a high basis of comparison. Connected Home’s customers are experiencing a high level of inventories due to weaker demand  and SCS is suffering lower DVD demand than expected. The Group continues to apply strict cost control and efficiency measures to offset the impact of the lower volumes. Therefore  the full-year guidance is maintained.Revenues decreased by 12.9% to €1 038 million (-13.3% at constant exchange rate).decreased by 12.9% to €1 038 million (-13.3% at constant exchange rate).

Adjusted EBITA at €9 million (vs €22 million in H1 2022).at €9 million (vs €22 million in H1 2022). The structural decrease in the DVD demand was stronger than expected and triggered a review of SCS’ legacy and growth activities assumptions. This review has led to a €133 million impairment of SCS’ goodwill.Net result from continuing operations was negative at -€227 million vs -75 million in H1 2022.was negative at -€227 million vs -75 million in H1 2022.

At the end of the semester  Vantiva held a cash position of €39 million.of €39 million. Total net debt (witho capital lease) amounted to €378 million in nominal terms.The Group is working on new sources of financing  better suited to the seasonal nature of its business than the current line of credit.Luis Martinez-Amago  Chief Executive Officer of Vantiva  said:“Our first-half results in line with our expectations  but down compared to last year. As anticipated  we experienced a more difficult environment and weaker demand from some of our clients in the Connected Home sector. The latter are seeing high inventory levels coming from a strong 2022  and weaker consumer demand this year. The DVD activity is still suffering from a structural decline  more severe than expected in H1. However  our productivity improvements and diversification strategy will gradually turn around this activity. We expect some recovery in H2 and this combined with the positive impact of the efficiency measures taken allow us to confirm the guidance for the full year. Moreover  I would like to thank all our employees for their contribution to this goal. The Group is fully focused on implementing our diversification plans  productivity improvements and preparing the next generation of products that will drive the business in the future as proven by the first successes of our Wi-Fi 7 and DOCSIS 4.0 offers.”I- H1 2023 Key Highlights & 2023 OutlookIn € million  continuing operations H1 2023 H1 2022 Change at current rate Change at constant Rate Revenues 1 038 1 193 (12.9)% (13.3)% Adjusted EBITDA 49 73 (32.4)% (33.3)% As a % of revenues 4.7% 6 1% (137)bps (141)bps Adjusted EBITA 9 22 (58.5)% (60.0)% Free Cash Flow before Financial & Tax (74) (21) (53)2022 amounts restated considering Technicolor Creatives Studios accounted for as discontinued operationsH1 2023 Key HighlightsThe demand from some of our large Connected Home customers has been lower than in the previous year as the global economic environment makes them cautious  especially regarding their inventory management. This has been particularly true in the North America and APAC regions which had enjoyed strong business trends a year ago. The decrease in optical discs demand has been more severe than expected. Beyond the structural decline  demand suffered from excess inventory built by our customers during the chips crisis. On the other hand  the ramp up of vinyl production ramp up has mitigated this negative effect to some extent. The Group continues to take the measures necessary to defend its profitability.Vantiva revenues totaled €1 038 million  down 12.9% (-13.3% at constant exchange rate).Connected Home revenues amounted to €807 million for the half  a decrease of 10% (-10.3% at constant exchange rate). Supply Chain Solutions revenues were €231 million  down 21.9% (-22.4% at constant exchange rate).Adjusted EBITDA  despite strict cost control in both divisions  has been negatively impacted by this volume decline and fell by €24 million to amount to €49 million in the semester vs €73 million in H1 2022.Connected Home contributed €56 million (versus €70 million in the previous year) to adjusted EBITDA while Supply Chain Solutions contributed €7 million (versus €15 million in H1 last year).FCF  before financial and tax for the half was negative by -€74 million  showing a €53 million deterioration over last year  due to lower EBITDA  higher capex and a less favorable change in working capital.Outlook 2023For the second part of the year Vantiva expects some recovery in demand and positive impact from the actions implemented to preserve profitability.Revenues of Connected Home division  as planned  are expected to be down compared to last year. Broadband products should grow somewhat but video devices will continue to decline.The DVD business will still be under pressure  but we expect some normalization in the demand in H2. SCS’ full year revenue is likely to remain below last year’s level.Against this backdrop and  thanks to its operational efficiency  the Group is maintaining its targets for FY 2023:EBITDA > €140mEBITA > €45mFCF 2 > €50mII- Segment Review – H1 2023 Results HighlightsConnected HomeRevenues breakdown by productIn € million H1 2023 H1 2022 Change at current rate Change at constant rate Revenues 807 897 (10.0)% (10.3)% o/w by product Broadband 647 694 (6.8)% (7.5)% Video 160 202 (20.8)% (19.7)% EBITDA adj 56 70 (19)% (19.8)% As a % of revenues 7.0% 7.8%Connected Home revenues contributed 78% of Group revenues (75% in H1 22) and totaled €807 million in the semester  down 10%. At constant exchange rate  the decrease would have been -10.3% compared with H1 2022. Sales of broadband products in our largest region  North America  were down as operators cautiously managed their level of inventories and in Asia Pacific revenues have been penalized by a change of product generation. LATAM and EMEA reported double digit growth thanks to fiber which remains the growth driver. Cable demand has been slightly down and xDSL in decline. Globally Broadband revenues were down 6.8% in the period  whereas Video revenues decreased by 20.8%. LATAM has been particularly hit by weak demand for satellite TV devices.Adjusted EBITDA of the division amounted to €56 million (vs €70 million in H1 22)  or 7% of revenues (vs 7.8% in H1 22). Despite the drop in revenues  the division has been able to limit the margin decline to 80 basis points thanks to strict cost control and operational efficiency. Chips availability has improved materially and lead-times are getting better  but prices remain high.Supply Chain SolutionsIn € million H1 2023 H1 2022 Change atcurrent rate Change atconstant rate Revenues 231 296 (21.9)% (22.4)% o/w by activity Disc 193 265 (27.1)% (27.5)% Growth activities 38 30 24.0% 22.9% EBITDA 7 15 (55.0)% (55.2)% As a % of revenues 3.0% 5.2%Supply Chain Solutions revenues totaled €231 million in the period  down 21.9% from H1 2022. At constant exchange rate the decline would have been 22.4%. The structural decline of the optical disc activity  has been amplified by a less favorable economic environment and inventory adjustments  especially in the US. This has led the major studios to reduce orders for optical discs and associated services. Globally Discs revenues were down 27.1% in the half.The diversification activities performed better showing 24.0% revenue growth  but this was not enough to compensate for the 40% volume decline in discs. In contrast  the production of vinyl has benefited from higher capacity and the ramp up is accelerating.Adjusted EBITDA of the division amounted to €7 million (vs €15m in H1 22)  or 3.0% of revenues (5.2% in H1 22).

SCS suffered from the decrease of DVD demand  largely in the US partly due to inventories adjustment from the major studios.H1 Adjusted EBITDA amounted to €49 million  down 32 4% year-on-year and represented 4 7% of the revenues. Both division’s contributions fell in the first half  being impacted by lower volume  and the corporate costs were slightly higher than a year ago.H1 Adjusted EBITA of €9 million represented a €13 million year-on-year decrease  despite lower depreciation.PPA amortization was slightly down at -€13 million versus -€16 in H1 2022.Non-recurring items amounted to -€146 million versus -€17 million a year ago:restructuring costs accounting for -€8 million versus -€6 million in H1 2022.other income and expenses of -€4 million showed an improvement over H1 2022 of €5 million.net impairment stood at -€135 million (versus -€2 million) mostly because of the €133 million impairment of SCS’ goodwill.EBIT from continuing operations was a -€150 million loss compared to -€11 million.The financial result totaled -€55 million in the first half  compared to -€61 million in H1 2022. This improvement stems from the financial interest costs  which decreased by €34 million. However  part of this improvement has been offset by the fair value adjustment of the TCS’ shares from the date of their deconsolidation  the 8th of June  to the end of the semester.Income tax is a positive of €3 million  thanks to deferred tax in Mexico  whereas it was a negative of €4 million a year ago.Result from associated is negative of 25 million mostly resulting from a depreciation of our stake in TCS from the first of January to the deconsolidation date.Net loss from continued operations amounted to -€227 million compared to -€75 million in H1 2022.Result of discontinued operations showed a small loss of €2 million.Group net result therefore is a loss of €229 million in the half  compared to a loss of -€14 million in H1 2022.FCF and debt analysisIn € million H1 2023 H1 2022 Change at current rate Change at constant rate Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations 49 73 (32.4)% (33.3)% Capex (44) (32) 37.9% 36.5% Non-recurring items (cash impact) (26) (29) (9.4)% (9.2%) Change in working capital and other assets and liabilities (54) (34) (20) Free Cash Flow from continuing operations before Tax & Financial (74) (21) (53) na2022 amounts restated considering Technicolor Creatives Studios accounted for as discontinued operations.30/06/2023 31/12/2022 Nominal gross debt (including Lease debt) 487 449 Cash and cash equivalent (39) (167) Net financial debt at nominal value (non IFRS) 448 282 IFRS adjustment (9) (19) Net financial debt (IFRS) 439 2632022 amounts restated considering Technicolor Creatives Studios accounted for as discontinued operations.Capex increased 37.9% and reached €44 million in the semester as Connected Home is investing in new products  including IOT for verticals  and SCS in additional capacity for vinyl production.Free Cash Flow3 went from -€21 million to -€74 million.

GTT  the technological expert in membrane containment systems used to transport and store liquefied gases  today announces its results for the first half of the 2023 financial year.Commenting on the results  Philippe Berterottière  Chairman and CEO of GTT  said: “With a total of 42 orders for LNG carriers and one order for an FLNG unit  GTT's commercial performance in the first half of 2023 continues to be very strong  in the wake of an exceptional 2022. LNG demand remains particularly strong  as illustrated by the number of long-term sales and purchase agreements leading to numerous final investment decisions for new liquefaction plants and to additional needs for LNG carriers.The GTT Group is pursuing its continued R&D and innovation efforts  as evidenced by several new approvals obtained from classification societies during the first half of 2023  notably in the field of alternative fuels. Confirming its technological foothold in the hydrogen field  GTT also signed a new partnership agreement for the development of a concept for a very large-capacity LH 2 carrier.From the financial point of view  revenues for the first half of 2023 show an increase of 23.3% compared with the same period of 2022  and earnings are rising steeply as the Group begins to benefit from the numerous orders received in 2021 and 2022. In view of the shipbuilding schedules  the Group therefore confirms its revenue and EBITDA forecasts for the whole of the 2023 financial year. We are also proposing an interim dividend of 1.85 euro  reflecting the Group's strong performance.”Group business activity in H1 2023- Continued momentum in LNG carrier ordersFollowing a record year in 2022 in terms of orders received  GTT booked 42 orders for LNG carriers in the first half of 2023. Their delivery is scheduled between the first quarter of 2026 and the fourth quarter of 2027.GTT also received an order for one FLNG unit  which will be delivered in the first quarter of 2027.- LNG as fuelIn July 2023  GTT received an order from its partner  the Chinese shipyard Yangzijiang  to design the cryogenic tanks for ten LNG-powered ultra-large container ships. Delivery of these container ships is scheduled between the second quarter of 2026 and the first quarter of 2028.- Services for vessels in operationIn May 2023  GTT signed a new Technical Service Agreement with the maritime transportation company Eastern Pacific Shipping and its subsidiary Coolco to support them with the maintenance and operation of a fleet of 33 vessels (24 LNG carriers  6 ethane carriers and 3 container ships).- Digital: new contracts and new solutionsIn March 2023  Marorka signed an important contract with a major European maritime transportation company to install automatic data collection systems and intelligent software to manage and optimise energy and environmental performance on 30 container ships  with an option for a further 30 in 2024.In addition  GTT has been chosen by two major European LNG ship-owners to equip three vessels with its predictive maintenance solution  the “Sloshing Virtual Sensor”. This solution allows ship-owners and charterers to optimise tank maintenance  while complying with strict safety standards  improving operational flexibility and making substantial savings.In May 2023  Ascenz Marorka won two contracts with JOVO  a supplier of clean energy services based in China  to equip two LNG carriers with its Smart Shipping solution.Finally  in June 2023  Ascenz Marorka obtained a Type Approval certification by the classification society DNV for its Shaft Power Limitation (ShaPoLi1) solution for vessel propellers. This solution helps ship-owners and operators comply with the International Maritime Organization (IMO) regulations aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and carbon intensity by 40% before 2030.- Elogen pursues its developmentIn H1 2023  Elogen’s revenues2 rose by 26.2% to 2.2 million euros  compared with 1.7 million euros for the same period of 2022 (as a reminder  2022 revenues amounted to 4.7 million euros). An acceleration of this revenue growth is expected in the second half of 2023. During the first half  EBITDA showed a controlled level of loss at -7.7 million euros  compared with -4.8 million euros in H1 2022 and -14.7 million euros for the 2022 financial year. The Group recalls that Elogen's EBITDA is anticipated to reach breakeven from mid-decade.From the commercial point of view  Elogen is continuing to implement its selective approach to projects  while showing good sales momentum. Its order book stood at 20.3 million euros at June 30  2023. This is 3.5 times higher than the order book at June 30  2022 (5.9 million euros).During the first half of the year  Elogen secured a flagship contract with CrossWind3  a joint venture between Shell and Eneco  to build a 2.5 MW PEM electrolyser for an offshore wind farm off the Netherlands coast.In July 2023  Elogen signed its first contract with its Korean partner Valmax  for the construction of an electrolyser with a power of 2.5 MW. With a production capacity of up to one tonne of hydrogen per day  this electrolyser will be integrated into a mobility project.In parallel with cost management and a selective commercial approach  Elogen is pursuing the implementation of its strategy around three imperatives: “Be efficient  be reliable  be ready”. Within this framework  Elogen is developing its R&D activities to improve the competitiveness and energy efficiency of its solutions  diversifying its technologies to produce large-scale electrolysers  and continuing the development of its network of local partners for Balance-Of-Plant assembly and maintenance. The company is also strengthening its technical and project management teams. Last but not least  Elogen is gearing up for its Vendôme gigafactory project (part of the IPCEI Hydrogen program).- Development of new technologiesInnovations in the field of LNG carriersAs a reminder  in the first quarter of 2023  GTT received approval in principle from the classification society Lloyd’s Register for a maintenance optimisation solution for LNG membrane tanks  called Sloshing Virtual Sensor.In addition  GTT and Samsung Heavy Industries received approval in principle from Lloyd’s Register for a new LNG carrier design  incorporating the three-tank concept developed by GTT and equipped with the Mark III Flex membrane containment system. This approval is the result of a joint development project initiated in 2022  aimed at designing a new generation of LNG carriers.Innovations in the field of LNG fuelled vessels / alternative fuelsIn March 2023  GTT received four approvals in principle from the Japanese classification society ClassNK for its latest alternative fuel development projects  namely:a 12 500 m 3 dual-fuel VLCC 4   equipped with the GTT Mark III Flex system;dual-fuel VLCC   equipped with the GTT Mark III Flex system; an LNG tank rated “NH 3 Ready” 5   which includes NH 3 -compatible materials  risk assessment and gas boil-off rate management;Ready”   which includes NH -compatible materials  risk assessment and gas boil-off rate management; an 8 000 CEU 6 dual-fuel PCTC 7 rated “NH 3 Ready”;dual-fuel PCTC rated “NH Ready”; the RecycoolTM system  applied to LNG-powered vessels  which reliquefies excess boil-off gas to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve economic performance.In May 2023  GTT received an approval in principle from Bureau Veritas for the design of a dual-fuel Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) fuelled with LNG  in the context of a joint development project between Shanghai Waigaiqiao Shipyard  a world-renowned and leader shipyard in the construction of tankers  and Bureau Veritas.In June 2023  GTT received three approvals in principle from DNV for its latest development projects in alternative fuels  namely:A concept for an LNG dual-fuel Suezmax tanker developed in collaboration with Deltamarin  fitted with a LNG fuel tank of 5 500 m 3 equipped with GTT’s Mark III system;equipped with GTT’s Mark III system; A concept for an LNG dual-fuel Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) also developed with the support of Deltamarin  fitted with a LNG fuel tank of 12 500 m 3 equipped with GTT’s Mark III system;equipped with GTT’s Mark III system; A concept for a Mark III LNG fuel tank with NH 3 Ready notation that includes material compatibility with NH 3   risk assessment and boil-off gas management.The Group also obtained a 4.66 million euro subsidy from Bpifrance for the design of an onboard CO 2 capture system for vessels and the development of intelligent operational performance solutions by OSE Engineering8 (GTT Group) as part of the MerVent project.Developments in the field of liqu id hydrogen (LH 2 ) transportationIn April 2023  GTT  TotalEnergies  LMG Marin and Bureau Veritas signed an agreement for a joint development project aimed at developing a concept for a LH 2 carrier with a capacity of 150 000 m3  equipped with GTT’s membrane containment system.In July 2023  GTT received an approval in principle from ClassNK for a new concept of membrane type containment system for LH 2 .- CSR strategyThe GTT Group’s CSR strategy is based on three key pillars:Sustainability starts with us  with priority given to safety  promotion of gender equality  talent retention  and the ongoing anti-corruption efforts. Environmental challenges are a driver of innovation: the Group’s R&D is increasingly focused on zero-carbon solutions  in line with the decarbonisation strategy. GTT is a responsible company  committed to significantly reducing its emissions.In this context  on March 13  2023  GTT announced that it had joined the United Nations Global Compact  thereby committing itself to promoting the “Ten Principles” on human rights  labour standards  the environment and anti-corruption  and to implementing the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)9 in its environmental  social and governance policy.By the end of 2023  the Group will complete the work of establishing a detailed roadmap for its CSR strategy.Order book at June 30  202310On January 1  2023  GTT’s order book excluding LNG as fuel comprised 274 units. It has since changed as follows:Deliveries completed: 11 LNG carriers  2 ethane carriers  2 FSU;Orders received: 42 LNG carriers  1 FLNGAt June 30  2023  the order book excluding LNG as fuel stood at 302 units  breaking down as follows:287 LNG carriers;2 ethane carriers;1 FSRU;1 FLNG;11 onshore storage tanks.Regarding LNG as fuel  with the delivery of one vessel  there were 69 vessels in the order book at June 30  2023.Change in consolidated revenues for the first half of 2023(in thousands of euros) H1 2022 H1 2023 Change Revenues 144 223 177 800 +23.3% New builds 130 656 163 530 +25.2% LNG carriers/ethane carriers 112 704 147 158 +30.6% FSU11 10 202 2 422 -76.3% FSRU12 - - N/A FLNG13 1 218 - -100.0% Onshore storage tanks and GBSs14 5 408 2 468 -54.4% LNG-powered vessels 1 124 11 482 +921.8% Electrolysers 1 723 2 174 +26.2% Services 11 844 12 096 +2.1%Consolidated revenues for the first half of 2023 amounted to 177.8 million euros  up 23.3% compared to the first half of 2022.Newbuild revenues amounted to 163.5 million euros  up 25.2% compared with the first half of 2022. Royalties from LNG and ethane carriers amounted to 147.2 million euros  up 30.6%. This rise is linked to the progressive increase in the number of LNG carriers under construction  thus generating additional income. Royalties from FSUs amounted to 2.4 million euros  down 76.3%  with the second and last FSU on order having been delivered during Q2  while royalties from onshore storage tanks and GBSs amounted to 2.5 million euros (-54.4%). Royalties generated by the LNG as fuel business are rising sharply (+921.8% to 11.5 million euros)  benefiting from the large number of orders received in 2021 and 2022.Elogen’s revenues amounted to 2.2 million euros in the first half of 2023  up 26.2% compared with 1.7 million euros in the first half of 2022. The Group anticipates an acceleration of revenue growth in the second half of the year.Revenues from services were up by 2.1% at 12.1 million euros in the first half of 2023  with income from assistance services for vessels in operation and increase in Ascenz Marorka activity more than offsetting the decrease in pre-project studies  for which demand is fluctuating by nature.Analysis of the H1 2023 consolidated income statementSummary consolidated income statement(in thousands of euros  except earnings per share) H1 2022 H1 2023 Change Revenues 144 223 177 800 +23.3% Operating income before depreciation and amortisation of non-current assets (EBITDA15) 79 706 104 195 +30.7% EBITDA margin (on revenues  %) 55.3% 58.6% Operating income (EBIT16) 75 937 99 617 +31.2% EBIT margin (on revenue  %) 52.7% 56.0% Net income 63 692 84 027 +31.9% Net margin (on revenues  %) 44.2% 47.3% Net earnings per share17 (in euros) 1.73 2.28Operating income before depreciation and amortisation of non-current assets (EBITDA) amounted to 104.2 million euros in the first half of 2023  up 30.7% compared with H1 2022  benefiting from the increase in revenues and non-recurring items (including a write-back of the KFTC fine provision of 8.1 million euros). The EBITDA margin on revenue stood at 58.6% in H1 2023  compared with 55.3% in H1 2022. External expenses were up 30.3% compared with the previous half-year  due in particular to the rise in subcontracting and travel costs linked to the increase in activity. Personnel expenses were up by 20.8%  reflecting the increase in headcount in the subsidiaries (Elogen  OSE Engineering  GTT China) as well as the overhaul of the compensation scheme (rebalancing between collective and individual components  adjustment of certain remuneration packages to the benchmark) which takes into account the impact of inflation.Operating income amounted to 99.6 million euros in the first half of 2023 compared to 75.9 million euros in the first half of 2022  an increase of 31.2%.Net income amounted to 84.0 million euros in the first half of 2023  compared with 63.7 million euros in H1 2022  representing an increase of 31.9%. The net margin was 47.3% compared with 44.2% in H1 2022.Other consolidated financial data(in thousands of euros) H1 2022 H1 2023 Capital expenditure (including acquisitions of non-current assets) (8 340) (12 668) Dividends paid (64 553) (57 277) Cash position 168 242 253 201 Change in cash (vs. 12/31) -35 563 +40 399The change in cash of +40.4 million euros at June 30  2023 mainly reflects the increase in deferred income (due to a larger number of vessels in the beginning of construction).

During the period  the top-line increased more than +30%  in line with our published target. Order entries – which totaled more than half a billion euros in H1 2023 – also grew dynamically  fueled by several wins in the United States  including the large Walmart contract. SES-imagotag's sales performance in H1 2023 was accomplished despite a challenging environment for retailers. This economic reality has had a negative impact on new investments  but at the same time reflects the increasingly strategic nature and acceptance of our solutions by our customers . Our margins have also evolved positively  enabling the company to continue improving its profitability. SES-imagotag expects to achieve its full-year top-line objective of €800m in 2023  and to continue its solid growth trajectory in 2024  driven notably by accelerating business in the United States.”Q2 and H1 2023 sales set new record highsAs previously announced  Q2 2023 set a new record  with quarterly sales of €221m surpassing the €200m mark for the first time  a +33% increase compared to the previous year. Second quarter order entries of €297m grew +38% year-on-year.In the first half of 2023  sales increased by +33% versus the previous year  to €380m  in line with the full-year target. H1 2023 order entries totaled €518m  a year-on-year increase of +35%  driven by wins in the United States.This performance was accomplished despite a challenging environment for retailers  with high inflation  lower consumption in terms of volumes  and downward pressure on margins.Challenging environment for the global retail industry  resulting in slower VAS growth (+18%)Despite the difficult economic circumstances they faced in H1 2023  retailers continued to deploy electronic shelf labels (ESLs)[2] for ongoing projects. However  some retailers have slowed down or postponed innovation projects  resulting in a lower growth rate for VAS sales  which increased +18% during the first half of the year. The recurring portion of VAS sales has continued to grow strongly  but revenues from new projects decreased slightly. At the same time  ESL sales increased +36% in H1 2023  leading to a VAS rate of 14% of total sales for the period.Sales momentum by regionSales in the EMEA region (Europe  Middle East and Africa) reached €317m in the first half of the year  constituting a strong growth rate of +43% compared to the previous year. The spike in the region's sales was driven by top-line growth in the DACH region (Germany  Austria and Switzerland)  where the deployment rate of ESLs increased amidst retailers' concerns regarding inflation and a tight job market.Sales in the first half of the year benefited from the continuation of large ESL deployments in Europe  including the signature of several new large contracts with food retail and non-food retail chains in the UK  Benelux  and Italy.Top-line in the Americas and Asia-Pacific regions (ROW) was €63m in H1 2023  a slight decrease versus the previous year  but showing strong growth of +27% on a like-for-like basis  driven primarily by North America. As a reminder  in the first half of 2023  the company no longer consolidates sales of the Chinese subsidiary (sold by SES-imagotag in September 2022) which reported sales of €15m in H1 2022. NB: the company's consolidated sales do not include sales to BOE.In the United States  the company had several wins in H1 2023  including a large contract signed with Walmart  and several deployments in food retail  specialized retail  and convenience stores. Given the execution of these contracts  and the positive sales momentum growth  the United States now represents a large majority of ROW sales. This growth is expected to accelerate  thus leading the United States to become the largest contributor to SES-imagotag sales as of 2024.OutlookFor the coming semester  SES-imagotag expects to continue driving its solid growth  and confirms its 2023 full-year revenue target of €800m.As previously announced  the favorable margin trends discussed at the beginning of the year have confirmed themselves and support the company's guidance for improved profitability for 2023.Next scheduled press release: September 11  2023 – H1 2023 Earnings ResultsFinancialsSales (€ m) Europe Rest of World Total Q1 2023 130.2 29.1 159.3 Q1 2022 91.4 28.8 120.2 Change (%) +42.4% +1.0% +32.5% Q2 2023 186.9 33.9 220.8 Q2 2022 129.9 35.8 165.6 Change (%) +43.9% -5.3% +33.3% H1 2023 317.1 63.0 380.1 H1 2022 221.3 64.6 285.9 Change (%) +43.3% -2.5% +33.0% 2023 12-month rolling 582.5 132.6 715.1 2022 12-month rolling 381.2 124.7 505.9 Change (%) +52.8% +6.3% +41.4%About SES-imagotag and the VUSION Retail IoT platformSES-imagotag is a world leader in smart digital labels and IoT solutions for physical retail  serving over 350 large retailer groups around the world in Europe  Asia and North America.SES-imagotag has developed the VUSION Retail IOT technology platform to help retailers transform their physical stores into high value digital assets  more automated  data-driven  and connected in real-time to suppliers and consumers.

Similarly  net margin decreased to 29.5% from 34.4% in H1-22OutlookQ3-23 revenue anticipated to decrease 20-30% vs. Q2-23 due to seasonal trends and ongoing market weakness with gross margin forecast to range between 62-64%(€ millions  except EPS) Q2-2023 Q1-2023 Δ Q2-2022Δ H1-2023 H1-2022Δ Revenue 162.5 133.4 +21.8 % 214.0 -24.1 % 295.9 416.4 -28.9 % Orders 112.6 142.0 -20.7 % 153.1 -26.5 % 254.6 357.9 -28.9 % Operating Income 62.9 41.7 +50.8 % 92.5 -32.0 % 104.6 174.2 -40.0 % EBITDA 69.3 48.2 +43.8 % 98.0 -29.3 % 117.5 185.2 -36.6 % Net Income 52.6 34.5 +52.5 % 75.6 -30.4 % 87.1 143.2 -39.2 % Net Margin 32.4% 25.9% +6.5 35.4% -3.0 29.5% 34.4% -4.9 EPS (basic) 0.68 0.44 +54.5 % 0.94 -27.7 % 1.12 1.81 -38.1 % EPS (diluted) 0.66 0.44 +50.0 % 0.90 -26.7 % 1.09 1.71 -36.3 % Net Cash and Deposits 74.0* 325.8 -77.3 % 284.0* -73.9 % 74.0* 284.0* -73.9 %* Reflects cash dividend payments of € 222.1 million and € 269.5 million in Q2-23 and Q2-22  respectively.Richard W. Blickman  President and Chief Executive Officer of Besi  commented:“Besi reported solid Q2-23 results with revenue and operating profit above the midpoint of prior guidance in a challenging industry environment. For the quarter  revenue of € 162.5 million and net income of € 52.6 million increased by 21.8% and 52.5%  respectively  versus Q1-23. Sequential revenue growth benefited from increased smartphone demand this year versus 2022 partially offset by weakness broadly in computing end-user markets. Net margins also grew to 32.4% versus 25.9% in Q1-23 reflecting revenue growth  gross margin improvement to 65.6% and strict cost control efforts of production and operating overhead in alignment with current market conditions.“We ended the quarter with a strong liquidity position including cash and deposits of € 387.3 million post the capital allocation of € 289.1 million to shareholders in the form of our annual cash dividend and ongoing activity under Besi’s € 300 million share repurchase program. Cumulatively  Besi has returned € 1.7 billion to shareholders over the past 13 years  representing approximately 30% of total revenue.“Revenue and profit development in H1-23 also reflected the impact of current adverse market conditions on Besi’s business this year with revenue and orders each declining by 28.9% versus H1-22 and net income decreasing by 39.2%. Current year revenue and order trends have been adversely affected by a broad based downturn in computing applications versus H1-22 partially offset by a slight uptick in demand for high-end smartphones versus 2022 levels. Automotive order trends remained favorable in H1-23 although slightly below the strong contribution reported in H1-22. Of note  revenue from China increased by € 10.5 million  or 11.4% versus H1-22 reflecting modest improvement in demand for automotive  power and smartphone applications although no meaningful uptrend has been established yet.“We are pleased with our profit performance in H1-23 despite industry challenges with peer leading gross and net margins of approximately 65% and 30%  respectively. Besi’s performance this cycle is also significantly ahead of the last downturn. In addition  we completed a strategic review of Besi’s business in Q2-23 with a leading consulting firm to help advance our ambitions for expanded revenue and profit potential in the next upcycle.“Progress continues on Besi’s hybrid bonding and wafer level assembly roadmap. Activity associated with hybrid bonding adoption has increased significantly over the past six months with the primary focus on customer qualification and testing of processes for next generation architectures and new market applications. We believe that the prospects for wafer level assembly growth have increased successively each quarter. This belief is based on the high-level of interest expressed by  significant resources committed to  and sampling work done by leading front-end customers  OSATs and the development community particularly for data center  AI  mobile and high bandwidth memory applications. The favorable outlook also reflects Besi’s first mover advantage  successful move to volume production  improved yields and ongoing progress in developing integrated hybrid bonding production lines with Applied Materials. We are also encouraged by the shipment of Besi’s next generation TCB system for qualification in high volume production. Further  the Singapore cleanroom facility was completed recently to support process development for hybrid bonding adoption.“Based on independent industry data  it appears that the assembly equipment market formed a bottom for this downcycle in Q2-23. In addition  customer utilization rates have increased recently although it is too early to say whether such increase represents a seasonal or structural trend. As such  the near-term market outlook remains uncertain and varies per end-user market. Accordingly  we anticipate that revenue in Q3-23 will decline by 20-30% versus Q2-23 due to typical seasonal patterns and current industry conditions. In addition  we expect gross margins to range between 62-64% and for operating expenses to decline by 10-15% versus Q2-23. We also expect that Q4-23 revenue will significantly exceed Q3-23 levels based on scheduled shipments from backlog  particularly for wafer level systems.”Second Quarter Results of Operations€ millions Q2-2023 Q1-2023 Δ Q2-2022 Δ Revenue 162.5 133.4 +21.8 % 214.0 -24.1 % Orders 112.6 142.0 -20.7 % 153.1 -26.5 % Book to Bill Ratio 0.7x 1.1x -0.4 0.7x -Besi’s Q2-23 revenue increased by 21.8% versus Q1-23 and was slightly above the midpoint of prior guidance.

After two years of very strong growth  the America posted a slight decline. By brand  SMCP benefitted from the double-digit growth of Sandro and the “Other brands” division (Claudie Pierlot and Fursac). Despite a complex economic environment  we were able to capitalize on the desirability of our brands to pursue our growth trajectory and post resilient profitability over the first six months of the year. We also successfully pursued the deployment of our CSR strategy  with an increasing proportion of our collections produced from sustainable materials  and all boutiques in eight of our European countries powered 100% by green energy. For the second half of the year  we have a clear action plan focused on pursuing our full-price strategy  excellent cost control and prioritizing our investments  while continuing to expand our network and improve the productivity of our teams. We are therefore confident in our ability to achieve our objectives for the full year 2023.”€m except %Q2 2022 Q2 2023 Organicchange Reportedchange H12022 H12023 Organicchange Reported change Sales by region France 101.0 98.0 -3.0% -3.0% 194.7 203.9 +4.7% +4.7% EMEA ex.

The second quarter was impacted by a challenging economic and social environment. Strikes  social tensions and persistent inflation discouraged consumption and touristic flows. In addition  the second quarter suffered from unfavorable calendar effects  with the start of public sales being delayed by one week compared to last year. The semester’s performance is driven by Sandro and by “Other brands” as well as digital sales.The network is growing with seven net openings in the second quarter.In EMEA  sales reached €189m  an organic increase of +9% compared to H1 2022 despite a high basis of comparison. The semester’s performance is driven by the largest markets such as Germany  Spain  Italy  and the Middle East  except the UK  impacted by a challenging economic environment. Such growth is driven by like-for-like (B&M and digital) but also by network expansion.The latest regained growth momentum in the second quarter with fifteen net openings (notably in Spain  Germany and Turkey).In America  after two years in a row of outstanding performance  sales reached €80m  a slight organic decrease of 4% compared to H1 2022. This slowdown is particularly due to Canada’s slow post-Covid recovery  accentuated by the retail market’s recomposition and by the lack of tourism from China. Sales in the US are resilient and are close to 2022 level  despite a challenging  promotional environment.The network regained growth momentum in the second quarter with four net openings.In APAC  sales reached €137m  +19% organic vs H1 2022. The trend is strongly improving during the semester with +3% organic in the first quarter and +43% in the second quarter. Mainland China is back to growth in the second quarter (+53%)  resulting in a double-digit growth in H1.Excluding Mainland China  the region also recorded a particularly good performance notably in Hong-Kong  Macau  Singapore and Malaysia  with good touristic flows.The network is slightly decreasing by three POS in the second quarter from network evolution’s phasing (but +2 POS overall in H1).Unless stated otherwise  all figures used to analyze the performance are disclosed by taking into account the impact of the application of IFRS 16.KEY FIGURES (€m) H1 2022 H1 2023 Changeas reported Sales 565.4 609.8 +7.9% Adjusted EBITDA 121.8 115.7 -5.0% Adjusted EBIT 45.2 36.3 -19.6% Net Income Group Share 20.7 14.0 -32.1% EPS2F2F3 (€) 0.28 0.19 -32.9% Diluted EPS3F3F4 (€) 0.26 0.18 -31.4% FCF 4.9 -8.7 -H1 2023 CONSOLIDATED RESULTSAdjusted EBITDA reached €116m in H1 2023 (adjusted EBITDA margin of 19% of sales)  compared with €122m in H1 2022.Management gross margin (73%) decreased by one point due to a bigger part of liquidation of previous years’ collections (especially in China and at Claudie Pierlot)  resulting in a reduction of the level of inventories. However  retail gross margin remains at a very high level on current collections  and the average discount rate in season is stable vs 2022  despite a competitive and promotional environment in most of the regions.Total Opex (store costs4F4F5 and general and administrative expenses) as a percentage of sales increased by one point  due to the impact of inflation on rents and wages  and the pursuit of investment in infrastructure and IT systems.Depreciation  amortization  and provisions amounted to -€79m in H1 2023  compared with -€77m in H1 2022. Excluding IFRS 16  depreciation and amortization represent 4.0% of sales in H1 2023  nearly stable vs 2022 (4.2% in H1 2022).As a result  adjusted EBIT reached €36m in H1 2023 compared with €45m in H1 2022. The adjusted EBIT margin is 6% in H1 2023 (8% in H1 2022).Other non-current expenses are not very significant (-€1m)  and stable vs 2022.Financial expenses are slightly increasing at -€13m in H1 2023 (vs -€12M in H1 2022)  the increase in interest rates was offset by a reduction in average outstanding gross debt.With an income tax expense at -€5m in H1 2023 (vs -€9m in H1 2022)  Net income - Group share remains positive at €14m (€21m in H1 2022).H1 2023 BALANCE SHEET AND NET FINANCIAL DEBTThe Group maintained a strict control over its inventories and investments during the semester. Inventories went down from €292m year-end 2022 to €278m as of June 30th  2023.Capex was relatively stable as a percentage of sales  representing 3.9% of sales in H1 2023  compared with 3.7% in FY 2022.Net financial debt at €306m as of June 30th  2023  vs €293M on December 31st  2022  and €314m on June 30th  2022.The maturity of the main lines of financing (including the revolving credit facility) has been renegotiated and extended to 2026 and 2027 depending on the lines  confirming SMCP's financial flexibility. Banks’ agreement has been obtained  and the effective extension is in the course of being executed.CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOKAfter a good performance in the first semester in terms of growth  with a resilient profitability in a challenging macro-economic and social environment  SMCP defined a roadmap for the second semester around 4 pillars:Pursuit of full-price strategy;Costs discipline;Prioritization of infrastructure investments while continuing network expansion;Improved productivity.In addition  the second semester  traditionally more profitable than the first semester  will also benefit from:The normalization (vs Q4 2022) of the situation in Greater China  a key market for the Group both in terms of sales and profitability;And from a more homogeneous performance by brand  notably at Maje  the most profitable brand of the Group.Based on these elements and provided geopolitical situation and macro-economic/social context do not deteriorate during the rest of the year  SMCP confirms its 2023 full-year guidance.OTHER INFORMATIONThe Board of Directors held a meeting today and approved the consolidated accounts for the first half of 2023.

The principal performance indicators used include the number of its points of sale  like-for-like sales growth  Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin  Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBIT margin.Number of points of saleThe number of the Group’s points of sale comprises total retail points of sale open at the relevant date  which includes (i) directly-operated stores  including free-standing stores  concessions in department stores  affiliate-operated stores  factory outlets and online stores  and (ii) partnered retail points of sale.Organic sales growthOrganic sales growth refers to the performance of the Group at constant currency and scope  i.e. excluding the acquisition of Fursac.Like-for-like sales growthLike-for-like sales growth corresponds to retail sales from directly operated points of sale on a like-for-like basis in a given period compared with the same period in the previous year  expressed as a percentage change between the two periods. Like-for-like points of sale for a given period include all of the Group’s points of sale that were open at the beginning of the previous period and exclude points of sale closed during the period  including points of sale closed for renovation for more than one month  as well as points of sale that changed their activity (for example  Sandro points of sale changing from Sandro Femme to Sandro Homme or to a mixed Sandro Femme and Sandro Homme store).Like-for-like sales growth percentage is presented at constant exchange rates (sales for year N and year N-1 in foreign currencies are converted at the average N-1 rate  as presented in the annexes to the Group's consolidated financial statements as of December 31 for the year N in question).Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA marginAdjusted EBITDA is defined by the Group as operating income before depreciation  amortization  provisions  and charges related to share-based long-term incentive plans (LTIP). Consequently  Adjusted EBITDA corresponds to EBITDA before charges related to LTIP.Adjusted EBITDA is not a standardized accounting measure that meets a single generally accepted definition. It must not be considered as a substitute for operating income  net income  cash flow from operating activities  or as a measure of liquidity.Adjusted EBITDA margin corresponds to adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales.Adjusted EBIT and adjusted EBIT marginAdjusted EBIT is defined by the Group as earning before interests  taxes  and charges related to share-based long-term incentive plans (LTIP). Consequently  Adjusted EBIT corresponds to EBIT before charges related to LTIP.Adjusted EBIT margin corresponds to Adjusted EBIT divided by net sales.Management Gross marginManagement gross margin corresponds to the sales after deducting rebates and cost of sales only. The accounting gross margin (as appearing in the accounts) corresponds to the sales after deducting the rebates  the cost of sales and the commissions paid to the department stores and affiliates.Retail MarginRetail margin corresponds to the management gross margin after taking into account the points of sale’s direct expenses such as rent  personnel costs  commissions paid to the department stores and other operating costs. The table below summarizes the reconciliation of the management gross margin and the retail margin with the accounting gross margin as included in the Group’s financial statements for the following periods:(€m) – excluding IFRS 16 H1 2022 H1 2023 Gross margin (as appearing in the accounts) 363.3 384.3 Readjustment of the commissions and other adjustments 57.6 61.8 Management Gross margin 420.9 446.1 Direct costs of point of sales -243.0 -269.8 Retail margin 177.9 176.3Net financial debtNet financial debt represents the net financial debt portion bearing interest.

AREPS was partly offset by disposals and lower C&E activity due to seasonality effects.OPERATING PERFORMANCEShopping CentresLike-for-like shopping centre NRI6 was up by +8.5% for the Group  and by +12.5% in Continental Europe  +9.4% in the UK and up +1.4% for US Flagships. US Regional and CBD assets were down -9.8%7. This overall increase is mainly due to the positive impact of indexation in Continental Europe (+6.7%) where all rents are indexed on a yearly basis  positive leasing activity contribution and higher variable income.H1-2023 tenant sales8 were up +9.2% compared to H1-2022  including +11.8% in Continental Europe  +6.8% in the UK and +4.6% in the US9. Sales continued to outperform footfall  reflecting the productive nature of visitors to URW’s centres. Footfall10 was up +7.3%  including +8.2% in Continental Europe  +9.2% in the UK and +2.7% in the US9.In H1-2023  European tenant sales were up +10.9% compared to H1-2022  above core inflation of 5.7% and national sales indices of 2.6%11  demonstrating that URW centres continue to gain market share. H1-2023 saw a strong increase in the performance of social and experience-led activities  with Fitness-related tenant sales up +35.7%  Entertainment up +22.4% and F&B up +17.1%  while Health & Beauty and Fashion continued to perform strongly  up +17.7% and +9.7% respectively.In the US  Flagships tenant sales12 were up +4.6% in H1-2023  performing above the US National Sales index  which was up 4.3%11. As in Europe  US Flagships growth was also driven by the performance of experience-led sectors  including Entertainment (+91.4% vs. H1-2022)  F&B (+20.6%)  Fitness (+10.9%) and Health & Beauty (+9.0%). Fashion sales decreased slightly by -2.0% and Luxury by -6.8% but both remained above 2019 levels (+14.0% and +87.9% respectively).Rent collection13 amounted to 96% for H1-2023 (vs. 96% and 95% initially reported in H1-2022 and in Q1-2023 respectively)  both in Europe and in the US. Net of bankruptcies  H1-2023 rent collection stands at 97% in Europe and for the Group. URW continued to collect 2022 rents  leading to an improvement of 2022 rent collection from 97% to 98% between FY-2022 and H1-2023.Bankruptcies increased in H1-2023 to 211 stores returning to a normalised level as government support and rent relief provided during the COVID period came to an end. More than a quarter of stores affected were in France. 84% of units affected saw their tenant still in place and 5% were relet  limiting the impact of bankruptcies on H1-2023 vacancy.In terms of leasing activity  the Group signed 1 180 leases for €219 Mn of MGR14 (+11% compared to H1-2022) during H1-2023 with an MGR uplift of +12.5% (vs. +2.6% in H1-2022) reflecting the effectiveness of the Group’s leasing strategy and the strong appeal for URW assets. The proportion of long-term deals signed also increased from 74% of MGR signed in H1-2022 to 78% in H1-2023. The MGR uplift for leases longer than 36 months came to +17.6% for the Group  on top of indexed passing rents  with Continental Europe at +6.5%  the UK at +20.1% and the US at +38.8%.On a like-for-like basis  Sales Based Rents (SBR)15 increased in total by +8.5% in H1-2023 vs. H1-2022 thanks to strong retailers’ sales performance including inflation  with +€10.0 Mn in Continental Europe  -€0.4 Mn in the UK and -€5.7 Mn in the US due to high SBR settlement in H1-2022 and conversion of SBR to MGR in the UK and in the US.Vacancy for Shopping Centres at Group level decreased to 6.3% at H1-2023  down from 6.5% at FY-2022 and 6.9% at H1-2022  thanks to the Group’s proactive leasing approach.In Continental Europe  vacancy was at 3.6%  below the 3.8% in Q1-2023 due to good leasing activity but up from 3.1% in December 2022. This was due to the normalised level of bankruptcies  and to the expiry of short-term deals in Germany and Austria which relied more on these deals during COVID.In the UK  vacancy decreased from 9.4% in December 2022 to 8.5% in June 2023 thanks to strong leasing activity.In the US  vacancy reduced to 9.9% in June 2023 from 10.4% in December 2022  with vacancy decreasing by -30 bps to 7.9% for US Flagships  close to pre-COVID level of 2019 (7.7%).Retail Media & other incomeRevenue from Retail Media & other income16 increased from €50.4 Mn in H1-2022 to €55.6 Mn in H1-2023  driven by the launch of Westfield Rise in Europe  an in-house media  brand experience and data partnerships agency. Total Westfield Rise activity in Europe amounted to €19.6 Mn in net margin at 100% in H1-2023  up +14% compared to H1-2022.Offices & OthersOffice NRI increased by +15.6% at Group level (+17.1% on a like-for-like basis)  driven by the leasing progress at Trinity in La Défense and the delivery of Gaîté Montparnasse offices  partly offset by 2022 and H1-2023 disposals  currency effects and assets in pipeline.Three new leases (Teamwill  IRI and Axway) were signed for Trinity in H1-2023. Trinity is now 85% let  at an average rent of c. €568/sqm  with lease incentives below the market average. In addition 1 400 sqm17 were leased at Westfield Hamburg-Überseequartier offices  bringing the letting17 of the office component to be delivered in 2024 to 34%.Convention & ExhibitionH1-2023 confirmed the strong recovery of the C&E activity observed in 2022. During the period  Viparis hosted 305 events compared to 272 events in H1-2022 and 386 events in H1-2019.Convention & Exhibition recurring NOI in the first half amounted to €71.1 Mn compared to €94.5 Mn in H1-2022 and €87.6 Mn in H1-2019  reflecting the change in seasonality patterns for events organised following COVID disruption.

The transaction value reflects a combined initial yield of 8.5% on the in-place NOI and a 12% discount to the last unaffected appraisal.The Group has started the process which will lead to the planned sale or foreclosure of 2 of its US assets  respectively Westfield Valencia Town Center  with a debt amount of $195 Mn at 100% ($97.5 Mn URW share) as at June 30  2023  and San Francisco Centre with a debt amount of $558 Mn at 100% ($340 Mn URW share). The book value at URW share of these assets was close to or below their debt amounts as at June 30  2023 at respectively $106 Mn and $301 Mn.Including these disposals and planned foreclosures  the total amount of net debt reduction stands at €0.5 Bn on an IFRS basis and €0.9 Bn on a proportionate basis.The Group is highly focused on its deleveraging plan  securing the remaining €0.7 Bn of its European disposal programme by the end of the year and further streamlining of US Regional portfolio. Once completed  it will pursue a disciplined asset rotation policy.The radical reduction of the Group’s US financial exposure remains its path forward. URW’s operational performance  in particular in the US  as well as its controlled cost of debt  ample liquidity position and capex control give it flexibility on when it executes this plan.DELIVERIES & PIPELINEAs a result of deliveries in H1-2023 and project cost evolution on some of the committed projects  the Total Investment Cost (TIC)18 of URW’s development pipeline remained stable compared to December 31  2022 at €3.1 Bn.The Group delivered 2 projects in May 2023: a 19 360 sqm extension to Garbera shopping centre in San Sebastian  Spain and the completion of Westfield Les 4 Temps renovation project of the centre’s main plaza “La Clairière”.Committed projects amount to €2.4 Bn  of which €1.4 Bn has already been invested.

Like-for-like shopping centres valuations were down -1.9% for H1-2023 including a yield impact of -4.8% and a rent impact of +2.9% as appraisers increased their assumption of discount and exit cap rates.The EPRA Net Reinstatement Value per share came to €150.70 as at June 30  2023  down from €155.70 (-3.2%) compared to December 31  2022  mainly driven by the revaluation of investment properties  and partly offset by the retained recurring results.FINANCIAL RESOURCESAs at June 30  2023  the Group’s IFRS net financial debt decreased to €20.5 Bn from €20.7 Bn as at December 31  2022.The Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio increased from 41.2% to 41.9% and 41.7% pro-forma for the receipt of the proceeds from the additional disposals secured to date or planned foreclosures20.On a proportionate basis  the LTV would be almost stable compared to FY-2022 at 43.0% pro-forma for the secured disposals and planned foreclosures.Net debt/EBITDA21 ratio decreased to 9.4x (vs. 9.6x in FY-2022)  the Interest Coverage Ratio (ICR) increased to 4.4x (vs. 4.2x in FY-2022)  and Funds from Operations to Net Financial Debt (FFO/NFD) ratio improved to 8.3% (vs. 7.6% in FY-2022).Over H1-2023  URW raised €653 Mn (€721 Mn on a proportionate basis) of medium to long-term funds in the mortgage and bank markets (including credit facility renewals)  further strengthening its liquidity position.On June 26  2023  the Group successfully completed an any-and-all par-for-par Exchange Offer on its €1.25 Bn hybrid Perp-NC23 notes (“Old Notes”) into a combination of (i) new Euro denominated Perp-NC28 hybrid notes with a coupon of 7.25% (“New Notes”) and (ii) a cash amount when applicable.The first of its kind by a corporate issuer  the Exchange Offer had a participation rate of 92%  corresponding to €1.15 Bn of Old Notes exchanged on July 3  2023 into €995 Mn New Notes and €155 Mn of cash paid (the Cash Amount).Accordingly  the Group’s overall hybrid portfolio will decrease to €1 845 Mn (corresponding to a reduction of 7.76%).The Group’s liquidity position reached €11.9 Bn (€12.0 Bn on a proportionate basis) including cash on hand of €3.8 Bn (€4.0 Bn on a proportionate basis)  allowing the Group to fully secure its debt maturities for more than the next 36 months.The Group’s average debt maturity22 stood at 8.0 years.The Group’s average cost of debt decreased from 2.0% to 1.8%  representing a blended average cost of 1.3% for Euro denominated debt and 3.9% for USD and GBP denominated debt  as a result of improved cash remuneration on its increasing cash position and a stable cost of gross debt thanks to hedges in place.ESGURW is on track to meet its Better Places 2030 targets  including reducing carbon emissions across its value chain by 50% between 2015 and 2030.

AREPS was partly offset by disposals and lower C&E activity due to seasonality effects.OPERATING PERFORMANCEShopping CentresLike-for-like shopping centre NRI6 was up by +8.5% for the Group  and by +12.5% in Continental Europe  +9.4% in the UK and up +1.4% for US Flagships. US Regional and CBD assets were down -9.8%7. This overall increase is mainly due to the positive impact of indexation in Continental Europe (+6.7%) where all rents are indexed on a yearly basis  positive leasing activity contribution and higher variable income.H1-2023 tenant sales8 were up +9.2% compared to H1-2022  including +11.8% in Continental Europe  +6.8% in the UK and +4.6% in the US9. Sales continued to outperform footfall  reflecting the productive nature of visitors to URW’s centres. Footfall10 was up +7.3%  including +8.2% in Continental Europe  +9.2% in the UK and +2.7% in the US9.In H1-2023  European tenant sales were up +10.9% compared to H1-2022  above core inflation of 5.7% and national sales indices of 2.6%11  demonstrating that URW centres continue to gain market share. H1-2023 saw a strong increase in the performance of social and experience-led activities  with Fitness-related tenant sales up +35.7%  Entertainment up +22.4% and F&B up +17.1%  while Health & Beauty and Fashion continued to perform strongly  up +17.7% and +9.7% respectively.In the US  Flagships tenant sales12 were up +4.6% in H1-2023  performing above the US National Sales index  which was up 4.3%11. As in Europe  US Flagships growth was also driven by the performance of experience-led sectors  including Entertainment (+91.4% vs. H1-2022)  F&B (+20.6%)  Fitness (+10.9%) and Health & Beauty (+9.0%). Fashion sales decreased slightly by -2.0% and Luxury by -6.8% but both remained above 2019 levels (+14.0% and +87.9% respectively).Rent collection13 amounted to 96% for H1-2023 (vs. 96% and 95% initially reported in H1-2022 and in Q1-2023 respectively)  both in Europe and in the US. Net of bankruptcies  H1-2023 rent collection stands at 97% in Europe and for the Group. URW continued to collect 2022 rents  leading to an improvement of 2022 rent collection from 97% to 98% between FY-2022 and H1-2023.Bankruptcies increased in H1-2023 to 211 stores returning to a normalised level as government support and rent relief provided during the COVID period came to an end. More than a quarter of stores affected were in France. 84% of units affected saw their tenant still in place and 5% were relet  limiting the impact of bankruptcies on H1-2023 vacancy.In terms of leasing activity  the Group signed 1 180 leases for €219 Mn of MGR14 (+11% compared to H1-2022) during H1-2023 with an MGR uplift of +12.5% (vs. +2.6% in H1-2022) reflecting the effectiveness of the Group’s leasing strategy and the strong appeal for URW assets. The proportion of long-term deals signed also increased from 74% of MGR signed in H1-2022 to 78% in H1-2023. The MGR uplift for leases longer than 36 months came to +17.6% for the Group  on top of indexed passing rents  with Continental Europe at +6.5%  the UK at +20.1% and the US at +38.8%.On a like-for-like basis  Sales Based Rents (SBR)15 increased in total by +8.5% in H1-2023 vs. H1-2022 thanks to strong retailers’ sales performance including inflation  with +€10.0 Mn in Continental Europe  -€0.4 Mn in the UK and -€5.7 Mn in the US due to high SBR settlement in H1-2022 and conversion of SBR to MGR in the UK and in the US.Vacancy for Shopping Centres at Group level decreased to 6.3% at H1-2023  down from 6.5% at FY-2022 and 6.9% at H1-2022  thanks to the Group’s proactive leasing approach.In Continental Europe  vacancy was at 3.6%  below the 3.8% in Q1-2023 due to good leasing activity but up from 3.1% in December 2022. This was due to the normalised level of bankruptcies  and to the expiry of short-term deals in Germany and Austria which relied more on these deals during COVID.In the UK  vacancy decreased from 9.4% in December 2022 to 8.5% in June 2023 thanks to strong leasing activity.In the US  vacancy reduced to 9.9% in June 2023 from 10.4% in December 2022  with vacancy decreasing by -30 bps to 7.9% for US Flagships  close to pre-COVID level of 2019 (7.7%).Retail Media & other incomeRevenue from Retail Media & other income16 increased from €50.4 Mn in H1-2022 to €55.6 Mn in H1-2023  driven by the launch of Westfield Rise in Europe  an in-house media  brand experience and data partnerships agency. Total Westfield Rise activity in Europe amounted to €19.6 Mn in net margin at 100% in H1-2023  up +14% compared to H1-2022.Offices& OthersOffice NRI increased by +15.6% at Group level (+17.1% on a like-for-like basis)  driven by the leasing progress at Trinity in La Défense and the delivery of Gaîté Montparnasse offices  partly offset by 2022 and H1-2023 disposals  currency effects and assets in pipeline.Three new leases (Teamwill  IRI and Axway) were signed for Trinity in H1-2023. Trinity is now 85% let  at an average rent of c. €568/sqm  with lease incentives below the market average. In addition 1 400 sqm17 were leased at Westfield Hamburg-Überseequartier offices  bringing the letting17 of the office component to be delivered in 2024 to 34%.Convention & ExhibitionH1-2023 confirmed the strong recovery of the C&E activity observed in 2022. During the period  Viparis hosted 305 events compared to 272 events in H1-2022 and 386 events in H1-2019.Convention & Exhibition recurring NOI in the first half amounted to €71.1 Mn compared to €94.5 Mn in H1-2022 and €87.6 Mn in H1-2019  reflecting the change in seasonality patterns for events organised following COVID disruption. Restated from the French State contribution received in 2022 and from triennial shows (held in 2018 and 2022)  the NOI was up +5.2% compared to H1-2022.As at June 30  2023  signed and pre-booked events in Viparis venues for 2023 amounted to 95% of its expected 2023 rental income.D ISPOSALSIn 2023 year-to-date  the Group secured further asset disposals in the US and Europe  reaching$1.6 Bn (€1.4 Bn) in total proceeds in the US  and completing €3.3 Bn of its €4.0 Bn European asset disposal programme  corresponding to total disposal proceeds of €4.7 Bn since 2021.In Europe  URW completed the sale of the “V” office building located in Versailles  France at €95 Mn  in line with the last unaffected appraisal value  with a double-digit IRR and a net initial yield of 5.7%.On July 11  2023  the Group signed an agreement for the sale of Novotel Lyon Confluence in France.The Group is in active discussions in relation to several European assets in a constrained investment market.In the US  the Group also continued to streamline its US Regional portfolio. On February 1  2023  the Group completed the sale of its ground lease for Westfield North County located in Escondido  California  for $57 Mn (at 100%  URW share 55%). On May 25  2023  the Group announced the sale of Westfield Brandon  located in Brandon  Florida for $220 Mn (URW share 100%) reflecting a 10.0% net initial yield and a 4.4% discount to the last unaffected appraisal.Since the end of H1-2023  the Group has sold the Westfield Mission Valley shopping centres in San Diego  California for a sale price of $290 Mn (at 100%  URW share 42%). The transaction value reflects a combined initial yield of 8.5% on the in-place NOI and a 12% discount to the last unaffected appraisal.The Group has started the process which will lead to the planned sale or foreclosure of 2 of its US assets  respectively Westfield Valencia Town Center  with a debt amount of $195 Mn at 100% ($97.5 Mn URW share) as at June 30  2023  and San Francisco Centre with a debt amount of $558 Mn at 100% ($340 Mn URW share). The book value at URW share of these assets was close to or below their debt amounts as at June 30  2023 at respectively $106 Mn and $301 Mn.Including these disposals and planned foreclosures  the total amount of net debt reduction stands at €0.5 Bn on an IFRS basis and €0.9 Bn on a proportionate basis.The Group is highly focused on its deleveraging plan  securing the remaining €0.7 Bn of its European disposal programme by the end of the year and further streamlining of US Regional portfolio. Once completed  it will pursue a disciplined asset rotation policy.The radical reduction of the Group’s US financial exposure remains its path forward. URW’s operational performance  in particular in the US  as well as its controlled cost of debt  ample liquidity position and capex control give it flexibility on when it executes this plan.DELIVERIES & PIPELINEAs a result of deliveries in H1-2023 and project cost evolution on some of the committed projects  the Total Investment Cost (TIC)18 of URW’s development pipeline remained stable compared to December 31  2022 at €3.1 Bn.The Group delivered 2 projects in May 2023: a 19 360 sqm extension to Garbera shopping centre in San Sebastian  Spain and the completion of Westfield Les 4 Temps renovation project of the centre’s main plaza “La Clairière”.Committed projects amount to €2.4 Bn  of which €1.4 Bn has already been invested. The main projects are the mixed used development in Hamburg (Westfield Hamburg-Überseequartier)  the office project of Lightwell in Paris La Défense  the residential project of Coppermaker Square  and the Triangle project in Paris.In H2-2023  URW plans to deliver Coppermaker Square Retail (a 7 437 sqm leisure development adjacent to Westfield Stratford City)  and the restructuring of the former El Corte Inglés unit  located in the extension area of Westfield Parquesur  with more than 14 954 sqm to extend Inditex brands. The average pre-letting19 of these projects stands at 83%.VALUATIONThe proportionate Gross Market Value (GMV) of the Group’s assets as at June 30  2023  decreased by -2.3% to €51.0 Bn from €52.2 Bn as at December 31  2022  mainly as a result of a like-for-like portfolio revaluation of -€1 019 Mn and disposals (-€343 Mn)  partly offset by Capex  Acquisitions and Transfers (+€574 Mn). Like-for-like shopping centres valuations were down -1.9% for H1-2023 including a yield impact of -4.8% and a rent impact of +2.9% as appraisers increased their assumption of discount and exit cap rates.The EPRA Net Reinstatement Value per share came to €150.70 as at June 30  2023  down from €155.70 (-3.2%) compared to December 31  2022  mainly driven by the revaluation of investment properties  and partly offset by the retained recurring results.FINANCIAL RESOURCESAs at June 30  2023  the Group’s IFRS net financial debt decreased to €20.5 Bn from €20.7 Bn as at December 31  2022.The Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio increased from 41.2% to 41.9% and 41.7% pro-forma for the receipt of the proceeds from the additional disposals secured to date or planned foreclosures20.On a proportionate basis  the LTV would be almost stable compared to FY-2022 at 43.0% pro-forma for the secured disposals and planned foreclosures.Net debt/EBITDA21 ratio decreased to 9.4x (vs. 9.6x in FY-2022)  the Interest Coverage Ratio (ICR) increased to 4.4x (vs. 4.2x in FY-2022)  and Funds from Operations to Net Financial Debt (FFO/NFD) ratio improved to 8.3% (vs. 7.6% in FY-2022).Over H1-2023  URW raised €653 Mn (€721 Mn on a proportionate basis) of medium to long-term funds in the mortgage and bank markets (including credit facility renewals)  further strengthening its liquidity position.On June 26  2023  the Group successfully completed an any-and-all par-for-par Exchange Offer on its €1.25 Bn hybrid Perp-NC23 notes (“Old Notes”) into a combination of (i) new Euro denominated Perp-NC28 hybrid notes with a coupon of 7.25% (“New Notes”) and (ii) a cash amount when applicable.The first of its kind by a corporate issuer  the Exchange Offer had a participation rate of 92%  corresponding to €1.15 Bn of Old Notes exchanged on July 3  2023 into €995 Mn New Notes and €155 Mn of cash paid (the Cash Amount).Accordingly  the Group’s overall hybrid portfolio will decrease to €1 845 Mn (corresponding to a reduction of 7.76%).The Group’s liquidity position reached €11.9 Bn (€12.0 Bn on a proportionate basis) including cash on hand of €3.8 Bn (€4.0 Bn on a proportionate basis)  allowing the Group to fully secure its debt maturities for more than the next 36 months.The Group’s average debt maturity22 stood at 8.0 years.The Group’s average cost of debt decreased from 2.0% to 1.8%  representing a blended average cost of 1.3% for Euro denominated debt and 3.9% for USD and GBP denominated debt  as a result of improved cash remuneration on its increasing cash position and a stable cost of gross debt thanks to hedges in place.ESGURW is on track to meet its Better Places 2030 targets  including reducing carbon emissions across its value chain by 50% between 2015 and 2030. The Group is committed to contributing to global carbon neutrality and will present a step-change update to its plan in H2-2023  with a view to establishing new commitments.In H1-2023  the Group pursued the implementation of its renewable energy infrastructure strategy with the delivery of photovoltaic plants at Centrum Cerny Most in Czech Republic.

The interim financial statements were subject to a limited review by the Statutory Auditors prior to publication.Wendel Group’s consolidated sales for the first half of 2023 reached €3 443.6 million  up +6.5% overall and up +6.0% organically.The overall contribution of Group companies to net income from operations amounted to €402.1 million  down 2.9% from the first half of 2022. Financial expenses  operating expenses and taxes recorded by Wendel represented €54.1 million  down €5.2 million from the €59.3 million reported in H1 2022. Non-recurring net result was a loss of €56.8 million in H1 2023 versus a gain of €533.6 million in H1 2022. This decrease is mainly due to the base H1 2022 comparison basis  which was marked by the sale of Cromology  which had generated a capital gain of €589.9 million in Wendel’s H1 2022 consolidated accounts. In H1 2023 impairment stood at €-8.1 million versus €-154.0 million in H1 2022 when an impairment had been booked on Tarkett for an amount of -€158.9 million. As a result  total net income amounted to €218.8 million in the first half of 2023  compared with €672.6 million in the first half of 2022. Net income Group share was €39.6 million  compared with €479.8 million in the first half of 2022.Group companies’ resultsFigures are presented including the impact of IFRS 16Bureau Veritas: Strong H1 2023 operating and financial performance; higher organic revenue growth expected for the full-year 2023.(full consolidation)Revenue in the first half of 2023 amounted to €2 904.2 million  a 7.8% increase compared with H1 2022. The organic increase was 9.4% compared with H1 2022  of which 10.3% in the second quarter of 2023  benefiting from solid market trends across most businesses and geographies. Four businesses delivered very strong organic growth: Marine & Offshore  up 15.6%  Industry  up 15.5%  Certification  up 11.2%  and Buildings & Infrastructure (B&I)  up 10.8%. Agri-Food & Commodities grew 6.5% organically  led by all segments. Conversely  Consumer Products Services declined 3.1% organically due to fewer new product launches and lower volumes.The scope effect was a positive 1.5%  reflecting bolt-on acquisitions realized in the past few quarters.Currency fluctuations had a negative impact of 3.1% (including a negative impact of 4.9% in Q2)  mainly due to the strength of the euro against most currencies.Adjusted operating profit increased by 5.7% to €434.2 million. First half 2023 adjusted operating margin was organically resilient as the Group managed to deliver broadly the same margin at constant currency (15.2%) as last year (15.3%) despite inflationary pressures and the mixed performance of Consumer Products Services. The adjusted operating margin was 15.0%.At June 30  2023  adjusted net financial debt was €930.8 million  i.e. 0.95x trailing twelve-month EBITDA as defined in the calculation of the bank covenant  compared with 0.97x at December 31  2022. The adjusted net financial debt decreased by €44.5 million versus December 31  2022 (€975.3 million).2023 New OutlookBased on the half-year performance  a healthy sales pipeline and the significant growth opportunities related to Sustainability  Bureau Veritas now expects for the full year 2023 to deliver:mid to high single-digit organic revenue growth (up from mid-single-digit organic revenue growth previously);a stable adjusted operating margin at constant exchange rates;a strong cash flow  with a cash conversion5 above 90%.For more information: group.bureauveritas.comStahl – Total sales down -5.9% in the first half  impacted by lower volumes  as observed generally in the chemicals industry. Solid EBITDA margin at 20.8%. Successful completion of the acquisition of ICP Industrial Solutions Group.(full consolidation)Stahl posted total sales of €443 million in the first half of 2023  representing a decrease of -5.9% versus H1 2022. Organic growth was down -14.3%  and FX impact was nil. The acquisition of ICP Industrial Solutions Group in March 2023 contributed positively to total sales (+8.4%).Activity in the global coatings industry was generally muted during the first half of the year in line with continued customer destocking and the reduction in industrial production globally. As a result  Stahl experienced lower volumes across its divisions  only partly compensated by favorable price trends. Effective margin management and strict cost control contributed to a solid EBITDA margin of 20.8%.Stahl expects the destocking of global supply chains to come to an end at some time in H2. In combination with cost containment and improving margins this should lead to an improved performance in the second half of the year.H1 2023 EBITDA6 amounted to €92 million  translating into an EBITDA margin of 20.8%  in line with Stahl’s historical levels.Net debt as of June 30  2023  was €293.1 million7  versus €97.7 million end of 2022 and leverage8 stands at 1.6x. As a reminder  Stahl completed on March 16  2023  the acquisition of ICP Industrial Solutions Group (ISG)  a leader in high-performance coatings for packaging and labelling applications (c.$140m in sales in FY2022). This acquisition reinforces Stahl’s position as the global leader in the field of specialty coatings and treatments for flexible substrates.Constantia Flexibles—Total growth of +13.3% with a strong EBITDA margin at 16.1% resulting from topline and operational performance as well as an accretive M&A strategy.In accordance with IFRS 5  Constantia Flexibles activities are reclassified to discontinued operations and operations held for sale and have been reclassified in Wendel’s consolidated financial statements.H1 20239 sales totaled €1 039.6 million  up + 11.7% on an organic basis driven by strong performance of the Pharma markets and sustained sales growth in the Consumer markets despite a somewhat more challenging macroeconomic environment. Total sales growth was +13.3%. The acquisitions of FFP Packaging Solutions (FFP) in August 2022 along with Drukpol Flexo and Lászlópack Kft. in H1 2023  contributed positively to the top line growth (+2.0%) whilst FX had a slightly negative impact of -0.4%.EBITDA stood at €167.0 million10  up +24.4%  resulting in a strong 16.1% margin  up 144 bps year on year. This is the result of (i) a positive price and mix effect (ii) pricing discipline and continuous efforts on cost reduction and (iii) an accretive M&A strategy.Constantia Flexibles continued its selective acquisition strategy: on March 2  2023  Constantia Flexibles announced the signing of an agreement to acquire the Polish company Drukpol Flexo and on April 6  2023  Constantia Flexibles announced the closing of the acquisition of Lászlópack Kft.  a Hungarian flexible packaging producer. These two acquisitions represent an estimated additional annualized sales of c.€45 million in 2023. These acquisitions in combination with the Propak (June 2021) and FFP acquisitions have significantly enhanced Constantia’s flexo printing capabilities whilst adding valuable local customer bases.The leverage ratio11 has been improved to 1.02x EBITDA compared to 1.2 at the beginning of the year  pro forma of recent acquisitions. Net debt stood at €315.8 million12 at the end of June 2023 (€313.1 million on December 31  2022). Constantia’s management continued to make significant improvements to improve cash generation through a disciplined capital expenditure approach and a working capital efficiency program.Crisis Prevention Institute – Total revenue growth of +10.5% as compared with H1 2022. Solid margin at 44.7%. Ongoing deleveraging.(full consolidation)Crisis Prevention Institute recorded first half 2023 revenue of $58.2 million  up +10.5% in total from H1 2022. Of this increase  +11.3% was organic growth  offset by -0.8% impact from FX movements.Growth was underpinned by continued expansion of the installed base of Certified Instructors (CIs)  as well as the related growth in peer training. Despite the staffing challenges facing both the education and healthcare industries in the U.S.  CPI successfully added CIs  expanded the customer base  and grew renewal volume. CPI’s revenue grew in both the U.S. as well as international markets.CPI continues to experience a mix shift toward digital solutions for both new CIs and renewals  with programs retaining the required in-person components. CPI generated EBITDA of $26.0 million13  representing a very slight decrease of 0.8% and margin of 44.7%. H1 EBITDA reflected planned growth investments in people and systems and  to a lesser extent  increased costs in travel and venues used for the company's in-person training  and slowing adoption of special topic certifications and renewals that benefited margins in 2022. Management expects second half revenue growth and limited additional cost increase to produce higher profitability.As of June 30  2023  net debt totaled $298.4 million14  or 4.79x EBITDA as defined in CPI’s credit agreement.ACAMS – Total revenue up +1% in H1 2023  with 17% growth in Q2 2023 impacted by Conferences timing effects. EBITDA margin in the first half of 19.9%  up 150bps.(full consolidation since March 11  2022)In the first half of the year  the revenue of ACAMS  a global leader in training and certifications for anti-money laundering and financial-crime prevention professionals  totaled $49.1 million15  up 1% over the same period in 2022  which included the benefit of an unusually large engagement with a current enterprise customer. Excluding the impact of this customer  year over year revenue growth for the first half of 2023 was 8%  reflecting strong attendance at ACAMS' conferences as well as acceleration in the company's enterprise sales efforts. As expected  the revenue decline in Q1 2023 was offset by strong revenue growth in Q2 2023 of +17%  substantially driven by the timing of ACAMS’ second-largest annual conference  which was held in Q2 2023 but historically in the first quarter of each year  including Q1 2022. Management expects growth for the rest of 2023 to be driven by continued enterprise sales. We note that the company’s focus on expanding relationships with large enterprise customers is an important long-term strategic initiative but the uncertain timing of large contracts and developments in the banking industry could drive volatility in the near term.As of June 30  2023  EBITDA16 was c. $9.7 million  resulting in a pro forma margin of 19.9%  up 150bps compared to last year. Looking forward  ACAMS is targeting EBITDA margin in excess of 20%. As of June 30  2023  net debt totaled $156.3 million17  which represents 6.6x EBITDA as defined in ACAMS’ credit agreement.Tarkett – Sales growth driven by Sport and price increases implemented in 2022. Stable EBITDA and good free cash flow generation.(Accounted for by the equity method)Net revenue in H1 2023 was €1 608 million  up by 2.8% compared to the first half of 2022. Organic growth reached 3.9%. The total effect of the selling price increases implemented in 2022 across all segments is +5.5% on average in 2023 compared to H1 2022. Over the period  volume fell by ‐2.1%. The strong Sport activity largely offsets the volume shrinkage in flooring  which is particularly pronounced in EMEA against a backdrop of weakness in the Residential segment. The currency effect contributed negatively  notably due to the depreciation of the Russan ruble  the Norwegian krone and the pound sterling in EMEA and the dollar.Adjusted EBITDA amounted to €126.1 million  i.e.  7.8% of revenue  compared to €126.2 million in H1 2022  i.e.  8.1% of revenue.Net financial debt amounts to €649 million at the end of June 2023  versus €655 million at the end of December 2022 and €778 million at the end of June 2022. Compared to December 2022  debt is slightly down  and leverage remains the same at 2.8x the adjusted EBITDA for the last 12 months.For more information: https://www.tarkett-group.com/en/investors/NAV of €163.2 per share as of June 30  2023Net asset value was €7 246 million  or €163.2 per share  as of June 30  2023 (see Appendix 1 and 2 below for details)  a decrease of 2.8% from €167.9 per share as of December 31  2022  and stable overall (-0.9%) adding back the dividend paid in June 2023.

After two years of very strong growth  the America posted a slight decline. By brand  SMCP benefitted from the double-digit growth of Sandro and the “Other brands” division (Claudie Pierlot and Fursac). Despite a complex economic environment  we were able to capitalize on the desirability of our brands to pursue our growth trajectory and post resilient profitability over the first six months of the year. We also successfully pursued the deployment of our CSR strategy  with an increasing proportion of our collections produced from sustainable materials  and all boutiques in eight of our European countries powered 100% by green energy. For the second half of the year  we have a clear action plan focused on pursuing our full-price strategy  excellent cost control and prioritizing our investments  while continuing to expand our network and improve the productivity of our teams. We are therefore confident in our ability to achieve our objectives for the full year 2023.”€m except %Q2 2022 Q22023 Organicchange Reportedchange H12022 H12023 Organicchange Reported change Sales by region France 101.0 98.0 -3.0% -3.0% 194.7 203.9 +4.7% +4.7% EMEA ex.

The second quarter was impacted by a challenging economic and social environment. Strikes  social tensions and persistent inflation discouraged consumption and touristic flows. In addition  the second quarter suffered from unfavorable calendar effects  with the start of public sales being delayed by one week compared to last year. The semester’s performance is driven by Sandro and by “Other brands” as well as digital sales.The network is growing with seven net openings in the second quarter.In EMEA  sales reached €189m  an organic increase of +9% compared to H1 2022 despite a high basis of comparison. The semester’s performance is driven by the largest markets such as Germany  Spain  Italy  and the Middle East  except the UK  impacted by a challenging economic environment. Such growth is driven by like-for-like (B&M and digital) but also by network expansion.The latest regained growth momentum in the second quarter with fifteen net openings (notably in Spain  Germany and Turkey).In America  after two years in a row of outstanding performance  sales reached €80m  a slight organic decrease of 4% compared to H1 2022. This slowdown is particularly due to Canada’s slow post-Covid recovery  accentuated by the retail market’s recomposition and by the lack of tourism from China. Sales in the US are resilient and are close to 2022 level  despite a challenging  promotional environment.The network regained growth momentum in the second quarter with four net openings.In APAC  sales reached €137m  +19% organic vs H1 2022. The trend is strongly improving during the semester with +3% organic in the first quarter and +43% in the second quarter. Mainland China is back to growth in the second quarter (+53%)  resulting in a double-digit growth in H1.Excluding Mainland China  the region also recorded a particularly good performance notably in Hong-Kong  Macau  Singapore and Malaysia  with good touristic flows.The network is slightly decreasing by three POS in the second quarter from network evolution’s phasing (but +2 POS overall in H1).Unless stated otherwise  all figures used to analyze the performance are disclosed by taking into account the impact of the application of IFRS 16.KEY FIGURES (€m) H1 2022 H1 2023 Changeas reported Sales 565.4 609.8 +7.9% Adjusted EBITDA 121.8 115.7 -5.0% Adjusted EBIT 45.2 36.3 -19.6% Net Income Group Share 20.7 14.0 -32.1% EPS2F2F3 (€) 0.28 0.19 -32.9% Diluted EPS3F3F4 (€) 0.26 0.18 -31.4% FCF 4.9 -8.7 -H1 2023 CONSOLIDATED RESULTSAdjusted EBITDA reached €116m in H1 2023 (adjusted EBITDA margin of 19% of sales)  compared with €122m in H1 2022.Management gross margin (73%) decreased by one point due to a bigger part of liquidation of previous years’ collections (especially in China and at Claudie Pierlot)  resulting in a reduction of the level of inventories. However  retail gross margin remains at a very high level on current collections  and the average discount rate in season is stable vs 2022  despite a competitive and promotional environment in most of the regions.Total Opex (store costs4F4F5 and general and administrative expenses) as a percentage of sales increased by one point  due to the impact of inflation on rents and wages  and the pursuit of investment in infrastructure and IT systems.Depreciation  amortization  and provisions amounted to -€79m in H1 2023  compared with -€77m in H1 2022. Excluding IFRS 16  depreciation and amortization represent 4.0% of sales in H1 2023  nearly stable vs 2022 (4.2% in H1 2022).As a result  adjusted EBIT reached €36m in H1 2023 compared with €45m in H1 2022. The adjusted EBIT margin is 6% in H1 2023 (8% in H1 2022).Other non-current expenses are not very significant (-€1m)  and stable vs 2022.Financial expenses are slightly increasing at -€13m in H1 2023 (vs -€12M in H1 2022)  the increase in interest rates was offset by a reduction in average outstanding gross debt.With an income tax expense at -€5m in H1 2023 (vs -€9m in H1 2022)  Net income - Group share remains positive at €14m (€21m in H1 2022).H1 2023BALANCE SHEET AND NET FINANCIAL DEBTThe Group maintained a strict control over its inventories and investments during the semester. Inventories went down from €292m year-end 2022 to €278m as of June 30th  2023.Capex was relatively stable as a percentage of sales  representing 3.9% of sales in H1 2023  compared with 3.7% in FY 2022.Net financial debt at €306m as of June 30th  2023  vs €293M on December 31st  2022  and €314m on June 30th  2022.The maturity of the main lines of financing (including the revolving credit facility) has been renegotiated and extended to 2026 and 2027 depending on the lines  confirming SMCP's financial flexibility. Banks’ agreement has been obtained  and the effective extension is in the course of being executed.CONCLUSION ANDOUTLOOKAfter a good performance in the first semester in terms of growth  with a resilient profitability in a challenging macro-economic and social environment  SMCP defined a roadmap for the second semester around 4 pillars:Pursuit of full-price strategy;Costs discipline;Prioritization of infrastructure investments while continuing network expansion;Improved productivity.In addition  the second semester  traditionally more profitable than the first semester  will also benefit from:The normalization (vs Q4 2022) of the situation in Greater China  a key market for the Group both in terms of sales and profitability;And from a more homogeneous performance by brand  notably at Maje  the most profitable brand of the Group.Based on these elements and provided geopolitical situation and macro-economic/social context do not deteriorate during the rest of the year  SMCP confirms its 2023 full-year guidance.OTHER INFORMATIONThe Board of Directors held a meeting today and approved the consolidated accounts for the first half of 2023. The limited review procedures have been completed by the auditors and the related report is being issued.FINANCIAL CALENDAROctober 26  2023 – 2023 Q3 Sales publicationA conference call with investors and analysts will be held today by CEO Isabelle Guichot and CFO Patricia Huyghues Despointes  from 6:00 p.m. (Paris time). Related slides will also be available on the website (www.smcp.com)  in the Finance section.FINANCIAL INDICATORS NOT DEFINED IN IFRSThe Group uses certain key financial and non-financial measures to analyze the performance of its business. The principal performance indicators used include the number of its points of sale  like-for-like sales growth  Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin  Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBIT margin.Number of points of saleThe number of the Group’s points of sale comprises total retail points of sale open at the relevant date  which includes (i) directly-operated stores  including free-standing stores  concessions in department stores  affiliate-operated stores  factory outlets and online stores  and (ii) partnered retail points of sale.Organic sales growthOrganic sales growth refers to the performance of the Group at constant currency and scope  i.e. excluding the acquisition of Fursac.Like-for-like sales growthLike-for-like sales growth corresponds to retail sales from directly operated points of sale on a like-for-like basis in a given period compared with the same period in the previous year  expressed as a percentage change between the two periods. Like-for-like points of sale for a given period include all of the Group’s points of sale that were open at the beginning of the previous period and exclude points of sale closed during the period  including points of sale closed for renovation for more than one month  as well as points of sale that changed their activity (for example  Sandro points of sale changing from Sandro Femme to Sandro Homme or to a mixed Sandro Femme and Sandro Homme store).Like-for-like sales growth percentage is presented at constant exchange rates (sales for year N and year N-1 in foreign currencies are converted at the average N-1 rate  as presented in the annexes to the Group's consolidated financial statements as of December 31 for the year N in question).Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA marginAdjusted EBITDA is defined by the Group as operating income before depreciation  amortization  provisions  and charges related to share-based long-term incentive plans (LTIP). Consequently  Adjusted EBITDA corresponds to EBITDA before charges related to LTIP.Adjusted EBITDA is not a standardized accounting measure that meets a single generally accepted definition. It must not be considered as a substitute for operating income  net income  cash flow from operating activities  or as a measure of liquidity.Adjusted EBITDA margin corresponds to adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales.Adjusted EBIT and adjusted EBIT marginAdjusted EBIT is defined by the Group as earning before interests  taxes  and charges related to share-based long-term incentive plans (LTIP). Consequently  Adjusted EBIT corresponds to EBIT before charges related to LTIP.Adjusted EBIT margin corresponds to Adjusted EBIT divided by net sales.Management Gross marginManagement gross margin corresponds to the sales after deducting rebates and cost of sales only. The accounting gross margin (as appearing in the accounts) corresponds to the sales after deducting the rebates  the cost of sales and the commissions paid to the department stores and affiliates.Retail MarginRetail margin corresponds to the management gross margin after taking into account the points of sale’s direct expenses such as rent  personnel costs  commissions paid to the department stores and other operating costs. The table below summarizes the reconciliation of the management gross margin and the retail margin with the accounting gross margin as included in the Group’s financial statements for the following periods:(€m) – excluding IFRS 16 H1 2022 H12023 Gross margin (as appearing in the accounts) 363.3 384.3 Readjustment of the commissions and other adjustments 57.6 61.8 Management Gross margin 420.9 446.1 Direct costs of point of sales -243.0 -269.8 Retail margin 177.9 176.3Net financial debtNet financial debt represents the net financial debt portion bearing interest.

The interim financial statements were subject to a limited review by the Statutory Auditors prior to publication.Wendel Group’s consolidated sales for the first half of 2023 reached €3 443.6 million  up +6.5% overall and up +6.0% organically.The overall contribution of Group companies to net income from operations amounted to €402.1 million  down 2.9% from the first half of 2022. Financial expenses  operating expenses and taxes recorded by Wendel represented €54.1 million  down €5.2 million from the €59.3 million reported in H1 2022. Non-recurring net result was a loss of €56.8 million in H1 2023 versus a gain of €533.6 million in H1 2022. This decrease is mainly due to the base H1 2022 comparison basis  which was marked by the sale of Cromology  which had generated a capital gain of €589.9 million in Wendel’s H1 2022 consolidated accounts. In H1 2023 impairment stood at €-8.1 million versus €-154.0 million in H1 2022 when an impairment had been booked on Tarkett for an amount of -€158.9 million. As a result  total net income amounted to €218.8 million in the first half of 2023  compared with €672.6 million in the first half of 2022. Net income Group share was €39.6 million  compared with €479.8 million in the first half of 2022.Group companies’ resultsFigures are presented including the impact of IFRS 16Bureau Veritas: Strong H1 2023 operating and financial performance;higher organic revenue growth expected for the full-year 2023.(fullconsolidation)Revenue in the first half of 2023 amounted to €2 904.2 million  a 7.8% increase compared with H1 2022. The organic increase was 9.4% compared with H1 2022  of which 10.3% in the second quarter of 2023  benefiting from solid market trends across most businesses and geographies. Four businesses delivered very strong organic growth: Marine & Offshore  up 15.6%  Industry  up 15.5%  Certification  up 11.2%  and Buildings & Infrastructure (B&I)  up 10.8%. Agri-Food & Commodities grew 6.5% organically  led by all segments. Conversely  Consumer Products Services declined 3.1% organically due to fewer new product launches and lower volumes.The scope effect was a positive 1.5%  reflecting bolt-on acquisitions realized in the past few quarters.Currency fluctuations had a negative impact of 3.1% (including a negative impact of 4.9% in Q2)  mainly due to the strength of the euro against most currencies.Adjusted operating profit increased by 5.7% to €434.2 million. First half 2023 adjusted operating margin was organically resilient as the Group managed to deliver broadly the same margin at constant currency (15.2%) as last year (15.3%) despite inflationary pressures and the mixed performance of Consumer Products Services. The adjusted operating margin was 15.0%.At June 30  2023  adjusted net financial debt was €930.8 million  i.e. 0.95x trailing twelve-month EBITDA as defined in the calculation of the bank covenant  compared with 0.97x at December 31  2022. The adjusted net financial debt decreased by €44.5 million versus December 31  2022 (€975.3 million).2023 New OutlookBased on the half-year performance  a healthy sales pipeline and the significant growth opportunities related to Sustainability  Bureau Veritas now expects for the full year 2023 to deliver:mid to high single-digit organic revenue growth (up from mid-single-digit organic revenue growth previously);a stable adjusted operating margin at constant exchange rates;a strong cash flow  with a cash conversion5 above 90%.For more information: group.bureauveritas.comStahl – Total sales down -5.9% in the first half  impacted by lowervolumes  as observed generally in the chemicals industry. Solid EBITDA margin at 20.8%. Successful completion of the acquisition of ICP Industrial Solutions Group.(full consolidation)Stahl posted total sales of €443 million in the first half of 2023  representing a decrease of -5.9% versus H1 2022. Organic growth was down -14.3%  and FX impact was nil. The acquisition of ICP Industrial Solutions Group in March 2023 contributed positively to total sales (+8.4%).Activity in the global coatings industry was generally muted during the first half of the year in line with continued customer destocking and the reduction in industrial production globally. As a result  Stahl experienced lower volumes across its divisions  only partly compensated by favorable price trends. Effective margin management and strict cost control contributed to a solid EBITDA margin of 20.8%.Stahl expects the destocking of global supply chains to come to an end at some time in H2. In combination with cost containment and improving margins this should lead to an improved performance in the second half of the year.H1 2023 EBITDA6 amounted to €92 million  translating into an EBITDA margin of 20.8%  in line with Stahl’s historical levels.Net debt as of June 30  2023  was €293.1 million7  versus €97.7 million end of 2022 and leverage8 stands at 1.6x. As a reminder  Stahl completed on March 16  2023  the acquisition of ICP Industrial Solutions Group (ISG)  a leader in high-performance coatings for packaging and labelling applications (c.$140m in sales in FY2022). This acquisition reinforces Stahl’s position as the global leader in the field of specialty coatings and treatments for flexible substrates.Constantia Flexibles—Total growth of +13.3% with a strong EBITDA margin at 16.1% resulting from topline and operational performance as well as an accretive M&A strategy.In accordance with IFRS 5  Constantia Flexibles activities are reclassified to discontinued operations and operations held for sale and have been reclassified in Wendel’s consolidated financial statements.H1 20239 sales totaled €1 039.6 million  up + 11.7% on an organic basis driven by strong performance of the Pharma markets and sustained sales growth in the Consumer markets despite a somewhat more challenging macroeconomic environment. Total sales growth was +13.3%. The acquisitions of FFP Packaging Solutions (FFP) in August 2022 along with Drukpol Flexo and Lászlópack Kft. in H1 2023  contributed positively to the top line growth (+2.0%) whilst FX had a slightly negative impact of -0.4%.EBITDA stood at €167.0 million10  up +24.4%  resulting in a strong 16.1% margin  up 144 bps year on year. This is the result of (i) a positive price and mix effect (ii) pricing discipline and continuous efforts on cost reduction and (iii) an accretive M&A strategy.Constantia Flexibles continued its selective acquisition strategy: on March 2  2023  Constantia Flexibles announced the signing of an agreement to acquire the Polish company Drukpol Flexo and on April 6  2023  Constantia Flexibles announced the closing of the acquisition of Lászlópack Kft.  a Hungarian flexible packaging producer. These two acquisitions represent an estimated additional annualized sales of c.€45 million in 2023. These acquisitions in combination with the Propak (June 2021) and FFP acquisitions have significantly enhanced Constantia’s flexo printing capabilities whilst adding valuable local customer bases.The leverage ratio11 has been improved to 1.02x EBITDA compared to 1.2 at the beginning of the year  pro forma of recent acquisitions. Net debt stood at €315.8 million12 at the end of June 2023 (€313.1 million on December 31  2022). Constantia’s management continued to make significant improvements to improve cash generation through a disciplined capital expenditure approach and a working capital efficiency program.Crisis Prevention Institute – Total revenue growth of +10.5% as compared with H1 2022. Solid margin at 44.7%. Ongoing deleveraging.(full consolidation)Crisis Prevention Institute recorded first half 2023 revenue of $58.2 million  up +10.5% in total from H1 2022. Of this increase  +11.3% was organic growth  offset by -0.8% impact from FX movements.Growth was underpinned by continued expansion of the installed base of Certified Instructors (CIs)  as well as the related growth in peer training. Despite the staffing challenges facing both the education and healthcare industries in the U.S.  CPI successfully added CIs  expanded the customer base  and grew renewal volume. CPI’s revenue grew in both the U.S. as well as international markets.CPI continues to experience a mix shift toward digital solutions for both new CIs and renewals  with programs retaining the required in-person components. CPI generated EBITDA of $26.0 million13  representing a very slight decrease of 0.8% and margin of 44.7%. H1 EBITDA reflected planned growth investments in people and systems and  to a lesser extent  increased costs in travel and venues used for the company's in-person training  and slowing adoption of special topic certifications and renewals that benefited margins in 2022. Management expects second half revenue growth and limited additional cost increase to produce higher profitability.As of June 30  2023  net debt totaled $298.4 million14  or 4.79x EBITDA as defined in CPI’s credit agreement.ACAMS – Total revenue up +1% in H1 2023  with 17% growth in Q2 2023 impacted by Conferences timing effects. EBITDA margin in the first half of 19.9%  up 150bps.(full consolidation since March 11  2022)In the first half of the year  the revenue of ACAMS  a global leader in training and certifications for anti-money laundering and financial-crime prevention professionals  totaled $49.1 million15  up 1% over the same period in 2022  which included the benefit of an unusually large engagement with a current enterprise customer. Excluding the impact of this customer  year over year revenue growth for the first half of 2023 was 8%  reflecting strong attendance at ACAMS' conferences as well as acceleration in the company's enterprise sales efforts. As expected  the revenue decline in Q1 2023 was offset by strong revenue growth in Q2 2023 of +17%  substantially driven by the timing of ACAMS’ second-largest annual conference  which was held in Q2 2023 but historically in the first quarter of each year  including Q1 2022. Management expects growth for the rest of 2023 to be driven by continued enterprise sales. We note that the company’s focus on expanding relationships with large enterprise customers is an important long-term strategic initiative but the uncertain timing of large contracts and developments in the banking industry could drive volatility in the near term.As of June 30  2023  EBITDA16 was c. $9.7 million  resulting in a pro forma margin of 19.9%  up 150bps compared to last year. Looking forward  ACAMS is targeting EBITDA margin in excess of 20%. As of June 30  2023  net debt totaled $156.3 million17  which represents 6.6x EBITDA as defined in ACAMS’ credit agreement.Tarkett – Sales growth driven by Sport and price increases implemented in 2022.Stable EBITDA and good free cash flow generation.(Accountedfor by the equity method)Net revenue in H1 2023 was €1 608 million  up by 2.8% compared to the first half of 2022. Organic growth reached 3.9%. The total effect of the selling price increases implemented in 2022 across all segments is +5.5% on average in 2023 compared to H1 2022. Over the period  volume fell by ‐2.1%. The strong Sport activity largely offsets the volume shrinkage in flooring  which is particularly pronounced in EMEA against a backdrop of weakness in the Residential segment. The currency effect contributed negatively  notably due to the depreciation of the Russan ruble  the Norwegian krone and the pound sterling in EMEA and the dollar.Adjusted EBITDA amounted to €126.1 million  i.e.  7.8% of revenue  compared to €126.2 million in H1 2022  i.e.  8.1% of revenue.Net financial debt amounts to €649 million at the end of June 2023  versus €655 million at the end of December 2022 and €778 million at the end of June 2022.

Impacts on the Group’s 2022 consolidated figures are presented in Appendix  at the end of this document.All figures related to worldwide or regional automotive production refer to the S&P Global Mobility forecast dated July 2023.H1 2023 KEY ACHIEVEMENTSRobust order intake > €15 billion in H1 2023 with high average profitability  reinforcing Group exposure to fast-growing segmentsIn H1  FORVIA recorded order intake above €15 billion  a high level reflecting strong momentum of both Faurecia and HELLA.Received awards reinforce the Group’s development on its key activities and geographies:€3.8bn in China  representing 25% of the Group’s total order intake  reflect the strengthening of the partnership with BYD  and healthy prospects with other Chinese OEMs and international OEMs representing 25% of the Group’s total order intake  reflect the strengthening of the partnership with BYD  and healthy prospects with other Chinese OEMs and international OEMs  €3.2bn in Electronics  representing 21% of the Group’s total order intake  highlight the strength of HELLA’s portfolio of technologies representing 21% of the Group’s total order intake  highlight the strength of HELLA’s portfolio of technologies  €7.5bn in Electric Vehicles (Evs + FCEVs)  representing 50% of the Group’s total order intake  benefit from a key commercial success with a major US EV car maker and a promising award with a Tier-1 OEM in hydrogen storage system representing 50% of the Group’s total order intake  benefit from a key commercial success with a major US EV car maker and a promising award with a Tier-1 OEM in hydrogen storage system  €8bn in Premium & SUVs  representing more than 54 % of the Group’s total order intake  included major conquests across the regions.It is worth mentioning:A major Lighting award with a large US EV OEM (SOP: Q4 2024) A new award for luxury complete seats for BYD in China (SOP: Q4 2024) A major Seating award with a German OEM in Europe (SOP: Q2 2026) And a key Electronics award for Clarion Cockpit Electronics with a Japanese OEM (SOP: Q2 2027).The order intake recorded in H1 2023 has an average operating margin above the Group’s Power25 objectives.Combination with HELLA gaining momentum and delivering accelerated synergiesThe pace of the combination with HELLA accelerated in H1  allowing FORVIA to make further progress on revenue and cost synergiesOn revenue synergies  Faurecia and HELLA made joint presentation for the first time at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas and at the Shanghai Auto Show. They will also will jointly showcase their technology offerings at the next IAA Mobility 2023 fair in Munich. At June 30  2023  cumulated joint order intake amounted to €1.9 billion.Leveraging on numerous projects in key areas  including procurements  freight and SG&A  Faurecia and HELLA delivered accelerated cost synergies in H1. Total cost synergies rose to €64 million at the end of H1 2023 (vs. €11 million at the end of H1 2022) and expected total synergies at year-end 2023 should exceed the initial target of €120 million (40% of the total €300 million cost synergies to be generated by 2025).Early July was created FH Services S.A.S.  a joint venture co-owned and co-managed by HELLA and Faurecia and designed to leverage the combined strengths of a shared organization  that will serve as the global provider of leading IT and Indirect Purchasing solutions to FORVIA’s collective 150 000 internal business users worldwide.Amicable resolution of the Jeep Grand Wagoneer Seating program in Michigan confirming the end of loss-making JIT operations by the end of Q3In H1  FORVIA and Stellantis amicably resolved claims between the parties allowing FORVIA to exit from the Just-in-time part of the Jeep Grand Wagoneer seating program in Michigan. The following actions will allow the program to break even by the end of Q3 2023:Termination of the Just-in-time business as from September 30  2023 Continuation of the Seat Frame activity  relocated in Monterrey (Mexico).Ongoing negotiations with customers to enhance inflation pass-through in H2In H1  operating margin continued to be impacted by cost inflation. Compared to 2022  when cost increases were predominantly caused by raw material prices  inflation in 2023 is mainly related to energy  labor and  to a lesser extent  raw material prices.In H1  FORVIA has decided not to accept insufficient compensation offered by some OEMs for around €30 million and will continue negotiations  in order to reach more acceptable agreements in H2.At the end of 2022  the cumulated inflation pass-through represented 87% of total gross inflation. Based on the carry-over effect of past agreements and expected positive impacts of ongoing negotiations  the Group expects to recover a higher percentage of inflation in H2 and reach at year-end at least the same level of 87% as reached at the end of 2022.All three transactions finalizing the €1 billion asset disposal have received clearance: two of them closing shortly and the third one expected to close by the end of Q3In H1  FORVIA signed three agreements finalizing its €1 billion asset disposal program that started in 2022:The sale of a 16.66% stake in Symbio to Stellantis for a total consideration of €150 million. All regulatory approvals required have now been obtained and parties are expecting to close this transaction shortly. Upon of this transaction  FORVIA  Michelin and Stellantis will be equal partners in Symbio at 33 1/3% each The sale of SAS Cockpit Modules division (assembly and logistics services) to the Motherson Group  for an enterprise value of €540 million. The transaction has now been cleared by merger control authorities in all relevant jurisdictions and parties are expecting to close the transaction within the coming days The sale of part of commercial vehicle exhaust gas aftertreatment business in Europe and in the United-States to Cummins for an enterprise value of €142 million. The transaction has been cleared by merger control authorities and parties are expecting to close the transaction by the end of Q3.The related cash proceeds will contribute to the accelerated deleveraging of the Group  with an objective to reduce Net debt/Adj. EBITDA ratio to between 2.0x and 2.2x by year-end.New ESG achievements with MSCI rating upgraded to ‘A’ from ‘BBB’ and new step forward on decarbonizationMSCI leading ESG rating agency upgraded FORVIA’s rating from ‘BBB’ to ‘A’. The agency welcomes positive evolution in the governance  specifically the alignment of the Board structure with investor’s interests. MSCI also highlights the entry in the Lighting business which has intrinsically lower exposure to product liability risks than other products in the auto supplier sector. After the previous upgrade from ‘BB’ to ‘BBB’ obtained in July 2022  this new step underlines the Group’s constant progress on ESG topics and now ranks FORVIA within the first quartile of the MSCI 32 auto components manufacturers universe.Building on its 2045 SBTi-validated Net zero carbon emissions roadmap  FORVIA made a new step forward in decarbonization by signing a ten-year Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with Renewable Capital. This deal is securing almost all the output from the 417 GWh  24 wind turbines  Klevberget onshore farm in Sweden and will generate the equivalent of more than 40% of all FORVIA’s European yearly electric consumption  taking its renewable energy capacity to up to 70% across Europe.H1 2023 KEY FIGURESThe automotive market grew by 11.2% in H1  driven by a sharp rebound in EuropeThe worldwide automotive production showed strong dynamics in H1 with a global production of 43.3 million light vehicles  corresponding to an 11.2% growth year on year. The market was supported by a very robust global demand and the progressive normalization of semi-conductor’s supply.In our main regions  trends were as follows:Europ e (47% of Group sales): production was up 16.1% at 9.2 million LVs  on a low base of H1 2022 impacted by the start of the war in Ukraine (47% of Group sales): on a low base of H1 2022 impacted by the start of the war in Ukraine  North America (24% of Group sales): production was up 12.2% at 8 million LVs  the highest first semester level since 2019 (24% of Group sales): the highest first semester level since 2019  China (20% of Group sales): production was up 7.1% at 12.6 million LVs  representing close to 30% of worldwide production.H1 2023 Group consolidated sales and operating incomeH1 2022 consolidated sales of €13 621 million: +21.3% on a reported basis and +18.6% on an organic basis  representing an outperformance of +740bpsOrganic growth of €2 092 million or +18.6% of last year’s sales  representing a strong outperformance of +740bps compared to worldwide automotive production that was up 11.2% during the period. Out of the 740bps  +430bps came from volumes  +110bps from inflation pass-through and +200bps from a favorable regional mix.Positive scope effect of €617 million or + 5.5% of last year’s sales  corresponding to the consolidation of one additional month of HELLA (consolidation started on February 1  2022).Negative currency effect of €322 million or 2.9% of last year’s sales  mainly due to the depreciation of the Chinese yuan  Argentinian peso and Turkish lira vs. the euro  mitigated by the appreciation of the US dollar vs. the euro.All Business Groups recorded a strong organic outperformance.H1 2023 consolidated operating income of €675 million  up 150bps at 5.0% of salesThe €277 million year-on-year increase reflected:Volume/mix effect for an estimated positive impact of €260 million  A negative currency impact of €45 million  Net inflation cost for an estimated year-on-year negative impact of €50 million  Acceleration in cost synergies related to the integration of HELLA for a year-on-year positive impact of €53 million (€64 million in H1 2023 vs. €11 million in H1 2022)  Sequential year-on-year reduction of extra-costs from the Seating program in Michigan  leading to a net positive impact of €20 million (€25 million extra-costs in H1 2023 vs. €45 million in H1 2022)  And the accretive contribution of one additional month of consolidation of HELLA for €38 million.It is worth reminding that commercial actions to mitigate inflation have a dilutive impact on operating margin  as they are at zero margin.H1 2023 SALES AND PROFITABILITY BY BUSINESS GROUPSEATING (31% of Group consolidated sales in the period)SalesStrong organic sales outperformance of 1 200bps driven by: Strong organic sales growth of +43% in China  driven by buoyant activity with BYD  and a major US EV car maker  Outperformance in Europe  with an organic growth of +19%  mainly related to German OEMs.Operating incomeOperating margin of 3.3%  up 150bps vs. H1 2022: This improvement included the positive year-on-year impact from the reduction by €20 million of the extra-costs related to the Michigan program (€25 million extra-costs in H1 2023 vs. €45 million in H1 2022). As already indicated on page 4  the agreement signed with the OEM allows FORVIA to exit by the end of Q3 from the JIT part of this program  that was loss-making  It also included a positive regional mix impact  as activity in China grew strongly and is accretive to operating margin  Conversely  operating margin was impacted by the dilutive effect of inflation pass-through.On July 20  FORVIA and BYD announced that will reinforce their partnership with the construction of new seat assembly plant in Thailand.FORVIA and BYD will launch the construction of a new state-of-the-art seat-assembly plant in the Rayong province of Thailand. This new facility will produce complete seat sets under Shenzhen Faurecia Automotive Parts Co.  Ltd  a joint venture created by BYD and Faurecia in 2017  majority owned by FORVIA.This strengthens the partnership developed with BYD  already active through seven cutting-edge factories established in China  including four within the past 18 months.FORVIA’s entry into Thailand’s market for its Seating activities marks a powerful milestone  complementing the Group’s existing industrial presence in the country across its Interior  Electronics  and Clean Mobility businesses.INTERIORS (18% of Group consolidated sales in the period)SalesSolid organic sales outperformance of 440bps  driven by double digit sales growth in all major regions  notably: Europe at +22%  driven by Ford  JLR and BMW  China at +24% supported by a sharp acceleration with a major US EV maker  Volvo and new entrants.notably:Operating incomeOperating margin of 3.8%  up 90bps vs. H1 2022. This improvement is the net result of: Positive contribution from volume/mix evolution  Negative contribution from the investment in Materi’Act  the newly created division for sustainable materials  the dilutive impact of inflation pass-through and costs generated by a high number of simultaneous starts of production.CLEAN MOBILITY (18% of Group consolidated sales in the period)SalesOrganic sales outperformance of 50bps  driven by: Robust dynamics in Asia (+20%)  supported by high level of activity with Volkswagen in China and major sales improvement with HKMC in the rest of Asia  Strong organic sales growth of +14% in Europe  mainly driven by Stellantis and Ford  And strong double-digit organic growth of +30% in South America  reflecting strong activity with Ford and Toyota.Operating incomeOperating margin of 7.7%  up 110bps vs. H1 2022. This improvement is the net result of: Positive contribution from volume/mix evolution and gradual resolution of some operational extra-costs that impacted profitability in 2022  Negative contribution from the development of zero-emission sales  which are not profitable yet  and the dilutive impact of inflation pass-through.ELECTRONICS (15% of Group consolidated sales in the period)SalesStrong organic sales outperformance of 750bps Double-digit organic growth across the Group’s Electronics activities  HELLA Electronics (c. three quarters of total FORVIA’s Electronics activities) was driven high demand for automated driving and energy management products  such as radar sensors and high-voltage battery management systems.Operating incomeOperating margin of +4.3%  up 20bps vs. H1 2022  was the net effect of: An improved operating margin for HELLA Electronics reflecting the net effect of improved operational performance and recovery from previous year’s difficulties in China  on one side  and increase in R&D expenses to develop order book and prepare for ongoing projects  on the other side  An operating loss for Clarion Electronics  mainly reflecting high increase in freight costs to maintain supply of semiconductors  unfavorable geographic mix and delay in inflation compensation with two Japanese OEMs.LIGHTING (14% of Group consolidated sales in the period)SalesStrong organic sales outperformance of 1 370bps Organic sales growth of c. 25% reflected market leadership position and favorable regional mix with strong demand from premium OEMs for sophisticated lighting solutions.Operating incomeStrong improvement in operating margin to +4.9%  up 410bps vs. H1 2022  confirmed turnaround underway and reflected: Positive operating leverage with improved business development  Improved performance in China that was impacted in H1 2022 by Covid-19 lockdown.LIFECYCLE SOLUTIONS (4% of Group consolidated sales in the period)SalesStrong organic sales outperformance of 290bps  driven by: Successful spare parts business with high growth notably in Mexico  Poland and Brazil  Strong activity with commercial vehicles.Operating incomeOperating margin of +13.2%  up 230bps year-on-year  reflected: Higher business volumes and SG&A savings  Strong inflation pass-through.H1 2023 SALES AND PROFITABILITY BY REGIONSalesStrong sales momentum in Europe (47% of Group sales) and China (20% of Group sales)  with outperformance of 270bps and 2 210bps respectively: Europe (within EMEA) recorded organic growth of +19%  driven by strong performance in Seating  Electronics and Lighting  China (within Asia) recorded organic growth of +29%  sustained by Seating  Lighting  and Interiors.(47% of Group sales) (20% of Group sales)  Organic sales growth of +10.3% in Americas was driven by South America that grew in strong double-digits while North America grew in high-single digits.Operating incomeOperating margin improved in all regions: Operating margin in EMEA started to recover  from 2.0% in H1 2022 to 2.6% in H1 2023  despite inflation  Operating margin in Americas also improved from 1.3% in H1 2022 to 4.0% in H1 2023  mainly driven by improved profitability of North American operations  Operating margin in Asia improved from 9.0% in H1 2022 to 10.4% in H1 2023  demonstrating robustness of double-digit operating margin in China.H1 2023 CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOMEAs detailed above by Business Groups and regions  operating income (before amortization of acquired intangible assets) rose by 69.6% from €398 million in H1 2022 to €675 million in H1 2023  an improvement of 150bps as a percentage of sales  from 3.5% in H1 2022 to 5.0% in H1 2023.Amortization of intangibles assets acquired in business combinations: net charge of €98 million vs. a net charge of €81 million in H1 2022  mostly reflecting the additional month of consolidation of HELLA  that started as from February 2022.net charge of €98 million vs. a net charge of €81 million in H1 2022  mostly reflecting the additional month of consolidation of HELLA  that started as from February 2022.

Change in factoring was an inflow of €149 million (vs. an inflow of €234 million in H1 2022 that reflected the extension of factoring program to HELLA): this inflow mostly reflected the redistribution of SAS outstanding factoring to the rest of the Group and included a €35 million temporary impact at the end of the semester as a consequence of a new payment system implemented by a customer (with no impact on net cash flow); at June 30  2023 total factoring amounted to €1 339 million  and should decrease to around €1.3 billion at year-end.(vs. an inflow of €234 million in H1 2022 that reflected the extension of factoring program to HELLA): this inflow mostly reflected the redistribution of SAS outstanding factoring to the rest of the Group and included a €35 million temporary impact at the end of the semester as a consequence of a new payment system implemented by a customer (with no impact on net cash flow); at June 30  2023 total factoring amounted to €1 339 million  and should decrease to around €1.3 billion at year-end. Restructuring cash-out amounted to €91 million (vs. €88 million in H1 2022)  financial expenses cash-out amounted to €234 million (vs. €170 million in H1 2022)  mainly reflecting the increase in net debt related to the acquisition of HELLA.

EBITDA ratio of 2.4x (before IFRS 5 impact) and 2.5x (after IFRS 5 impact)  significantly reduced vs. 3.1x one year ago.At June 30  2023 due to IFRS 5 implementation  Adj. EBITDA excludes the contribution from SAS considered as “Discontinued operations”  while debt is not yet reduced from proceeds to be received from the disposal. To better reflect performance  net debt/Adj. EBITDA ratio before IFRS 5 impact stood at 2.4x at June 30  2023  fully comparable to 3.1x one year ago.Net debt/Adj. EBITDA ratio will significantly decrease at December 31  2023 to between 2.0x and 2.2x  thanks to (i) the collection  by the end of Q3  of all proceeds related to the finalization of the disposal program launched in 2022 and (ii) the net cash flow generated in H2.At December 31  2023  FORVIA will already be more than half-way of its trajectory to reduce its Net debt/Adj. EBITDA ratio from 3.1x at June 30  2022 (first semi-annual ratio after the payment of the majority stake in HELLA) to below 1.5x at December 31  2025  its objective included in the POWER25 plan presented in November 2022.AVAILABLE CASH OF €3.5 BILLION AT JUNE 30  2023As of June 30  2023  Group liquidity amounted to €5.5 billion  of which €3.5 billion of available cash  €1.5 billion from the fully undrawn FORVIA Senior Credit Facility and €500 million from the fully undrawn HELLA Senior Credit Facility.As part of its ongoing proactive debt management policy  FORVIA has recently extended the maturity of almost all of its €1.5 billion Senior Credit Facility by one year to May 2027 (with options up to 2028)  has successfully refinanced its €500 million line now maturing June 2026 (with two possible extensions by one year each) and has extended a term loan of €200 million by two years until June 2025.FULL-YEAR 2023 NEW GUIDANCEBased on actual worldwide automotive production growth in the first half and expected evolution in the second half  FORVIA is revising upward its worldwide automotive production assumption in 2023 to around 86 million LVs (vs. 82 million estimated in February and S&P Global Mobility’s latest forecast dated July 2023 of 86.7 million LVs).As a consequence  the Group is adjusting upward its 2023 guidance as follows:Sales between €26.5 billion and €27.5 billion (vs. between €25.2 billion and 26.2 billion) (vs. between €25.2 billion and 26.2 billion)  Operating margin between 5.2% and 6.2% of sales (vs. between 5.0% and 6.0%)   confirming sequential improvement in H2 over H1 (vs. between 5.0% and 6.0%) Net cash flow > 1.5% of sales (unchanged) (unchanged)  Net debt/Adj. EBITDA ratio between 2.0x and 2.2x at December 31  2023(vs. between 2.0x and 2.4x).This guidance reflects the expected sequential improvement of operating margin in H2 vs. H1  led by:Acceleration in synergies  with the full impact of synergies implemented in the first half and the ramp-up of new projects identified Enhanced compensation for cost inflation through continued negotiations Sequential reduction in operating losses from the Seating program in Michigan (JIT loss-making operations to terminate at the end of Q3).This guidance is based on full-year average currency rates of 1.08 for €/USD and of 7.54 for €/CNY and assumes no major lockdown impacting production or retail sales in any automotive region in H2 and takes into account the Group’s latest update of net impact from cost inflation.ON TRACK TO ACHIEVE POWER25 OBJECTIVESThe Group also confirms its FY 2025 objectives  as presented at the Capital Markets Day held on November 3  2022:Sales of c. €30bnOperating margin > 7% of salesNet cash flow > 4% of salesNet debt/Adjusted EBITDA ratio < 1.5x at December 31  2025These financial objectives are based on the following main assumptions:Worldwide automotive production of 88 million vehicles in 2025  more conservative than S&P’s latest forecast of 90 million2025 currency rates of USD/€ @ 1.05 and CNY/€ @ 7.00They assume no major lockdown impacting production or retail sales in any major automotive region over the period.FINANCIAL CALENDARSeptember 4-8  2023: Presence at the IAA Mobility 2023 in MunichPresence at the IAA Mobility 2023 in Munich October 20  2023: Q3 2023 sales (before market hours)FORVIA's financial report will be available at 8:30am today (CET) and the financial presentation at 10:15am (Paris time) on the FORVIA’s website: www.forvia.comA webcasted conference call will be held today at 10:30am (CET).If you wish to follow the presentation using the webcast  please access the following link: https://www.sideup.fr/webcast-forvia-h1-2023-results/signin/enA replay will be available as soon as possible.You may also follow the presentation via conference call:France +33 1 8699 5831United Kingdom +44 203 901 7895United States +1 564 217 2000Confirmation code: 816 8525 3171#PRESS ANALYSTS/INVESTORS Christophe MALBRANQUEGroup Media Relations Director+33 (0) 6 21 69 23 53christophe.malbranque@forvia.com Marc MAILLETGroup Head of Investor Relations+33 (0) 1 72 36 75 70marc.maillet@forvia.comIria MONTOUTOGroup Media Relations Officer+33 (0) 6 01 03 19 89iria.montouto@forvia.comSébastien LEROYDeputy Head of Investor Relations+33 (0) 6 26 89 33 69sebastien.leroy@forvia.comAbout FORVIA  whose mission is: “We pioneer technology for mobility experiences that matter to people”.FORVIA  7th global automotive technology supplier  comprises the complementary technology and industrial strengths of Faurecia and HELLA.

It corresponds to net income of fully consolidated companies before:Amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations; Other non-recurring operating income and expense  corresponding to material  unusual and non-recurring items including reorganization expenses and early retirement costs  the impact of exceptional events such as the discontinuation of a business  the closure or sale of an industrial site  disposals of non-operating buildings  impairment losses recorded for property  plant and equipment or intangible assets  as well as other material and unusual losses; Income on loans  cash investments and marketable securities; Finance costs; Other financial income and expense  which include the impact of discounting the pension benefit obligation and the return on related plan assets  the ineffective portion of interest rate and currency hedges  changes in value of interest rate and currency instruments for which the hedging relationship does not satisfy the criteria set forth in relationship cannot be demonstrated under IFRS 9  and gains and losses on sales of shares in subsidiaries; Taxes.Adjusted EBITDAAdjusted EBITDA is Operating income as defined above + depreciation and amortization of assets; to be fully compliant with the ESMA (European Securities and Markets Authority) regulation  this term of “Adjusted EBITDA” will be used by the Group as of January 1  2022 instead of the term “EBITDA” that was previously used (this means that “EBITDA” aggregates until 2021 are comparable with ‘Adjusted EBITDA” aggregates as from 2022).Net cash-flowNet cash-flow is defined as follow: Net cash from (used in) operating and investing activities less (acquisitions)/disposal of equity interests and businesses (net of cash and cash equivalents)  other changes and proceeds from disposal of financial assets. Repayment of IFRS 16 debt is not included.Net financial debtNet financial debt is defined as follow: Gross financial debt less cash and cash equivalents and derivatives classified under non-current and current assets. It includes the lease liabilities (IFRS 16 debt).APPENDIXIFRS 5 RESTATEMENT ON 2022 SALES & OPERATING INCOME BY SEMESTERFaurecia’s SAS Cockpit Modules division (assembly and logistics services)  that was part of the “Interiors” Business Group and whose contemplated disposal was announced on February 19  2023  has been presented as “Discontinued operations” since the start of 2023 and impacts on the Group’s 2022 consolidated figures are presented in the following table.

The results will assist competent authorities in assessing ING Group’s ability to meet applicable prudential requirements under stressed scenarios.The adverse stress test scenario was set by the ECB/ESRB and covers a three-year time horizon (2023- 2025). The stress test has been carried out applying a static balance sheet assumption as of December 2022  and therefore does not take into account future business strategies and management actions. It is not a forecast of ING Group’s profits.Under the hypothetical baseline scenario and EBA’s methodological instructions  ING Group would have a fully loaded common equity Tier 1 capital ratio (CET1) of 14.37% in 2025. Under the hypothetical adverse scenario and EBA’s methodological instructions  ING Group would have a fully loaded CET1 ratio of 8.92% in 2025.We regularly run our own ING specific stress test and based thereon remain comfortable with our management buffer and our capital ratio target of around 12.5% CET1.ING Group published an actual fully loaded CET1 ratio of 14.8% per 31 March 2023. For more information see the results on the EBA website.Note for editorsFor further information on ING  please visit www.ing.com.

This includes its Family Plan  which moves up from $15.99 to $16.99 per month; it’s the second time SPOT has upped this particular price point in the States (the first was in 2021)  and brings Spotify’s Family Plan pricing in line with that of other services such as Apple Music and YouTube Music.The (much) bigger-picture news?Spotify isn’t just increasing its prices in the US – it’s also upping its subscription cost (across various plans  including individual Premium) in a whopping 52 other markets  including the UK  Canada  Brazil  Spain  France  Australia  Indonesia  Israel  Sweden  and Mexico.Yet how much will this new round of price increases from Spotify be worth to the company – and to the music rightsholders to whom it pays out around 70% of its income?This week  Reuters reported that US performance rights company BMI (Broadcast Music Inc.) is “once again exploring options including a sale”.The report arrived around a year after BMI scrapped plans for a multi-billion dollar company sale following underwhelming offers.BMI President & CEO Mike O’Neill issued a memo to staff this week addressing “press articles [that] have come out today speculating that BMI is considering a sale”.In the memo  obtained by MBW  O’Neill writes that  “Not surprisingly  interest in BMI has continued since we announced a year ago that we were no longer considering a sale of our company”.He added: “Since then  the success of our business model change and our commitment to investing in BMI to grow the value of our affiliates’ music has only intensified that outside interest…”Spotify CEO Daniel Ek is selling 675 000 Spotify shares worth $100 million. That’s according to an SEC filing that went live on Thursday (July 27).J.P. Morgan Securities is named in the filing as the broker for the sale.The filing also reveals that these shares are to be sold by D.G.E Investments Limited  an entity indirectly wholly owned by Ek…BeatStars revealed this week that it has entered into a strategic alliance with an AI music startup called Lemonaide  which has developed an AI-powered plug-in that generates ideas for beats.BeatStars also confirmed in its latest announcement that it has now paid out over $250 million to its members through its marketplace and publishing services to date (The company struck a partnership with Sony Music Publishing in 2020)…MBW’s Weekly Round-Up is supported by Centtrip  which helps over 500 of the world’s best-selling artists maximise their income and reduce their touring costs.Music Business Worldwide,neutral,0.08,0.9,0.01,negative,0.01,0.11,0.88,True,English,"['price hikes', 'Weekly Round-Up', 'Universal', 'Q2', 'Spotify', '50 markets', 'MBW', 'D.G.E Investments Limited', 'biggest subscription music streaming service', 'flagship individual Premium subscription price', 'J.P.
