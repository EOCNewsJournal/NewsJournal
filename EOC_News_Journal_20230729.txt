28445,Euroclear,Bing API,https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/europe-vowed-to-make-russia-pay-for-the-war-it-is-not-that-easy-8866444/,Europe vowed to make Russia pay for the war. Why it is not that easy,Confiscating Russian state assets frozen by the United States and Europe could breach international law and set a dangerous precedent  experts say.,The United States and Europe have wrestled for months with the question of how to pay for Ukraine’s reconstruction from the war. As Russia pounds cities  factories and infrastructure in Ukraine  the estimated costs have swelled to $500 billion  with some experts citing numbers as high as $1 trillion.One solution seemed brilliant in its simplicity: What better way to foot the bill  and to make a moral point  than to make Russia pay?But that has proved far more difficult than first imagined  and it appears less and less likely. Experts warn that it would likely violate international law and potentially set a dangerous precedent for countries to take the assets of others.The money once seemed easily within reach; since the beginning of the full-scale Russian invasion  Western nations have frozen more than $330 billion in Russian Central Bank assets held abroad.Leaders of the Group of 7 nations  the world’s biggest economies  said this month that the frozen assets “will remain immobilized until Russia pays for the damage it has caused to Ukraine.” But they recognized “the need for the establishment of an international mechanism for reparation of damages  loss or injury caused by Russian aggression.”With the bulk of the sum  more than $217 billion  frozen in the European Union  the bloc’s top official  Ursula von der Leyen  promised last month during a conference devoted to Ukraine’s reconstruction to present “by the summer break” a legal way to use those Russian assets for Ukraine’s benefit.But her declaration caused uneasiness among bloc officials and diplomats who have been involved in months of discussions over the idea and found it increasingly complicated.What are the obstacles?AdvertisementExperts said that seizing Russian state assets outright carried significant legal and financial risks.Under international law  the assets could be seized through a vote in the UN Security Council  a ruling of the International Court of Justice or a postwar deal. None of those options seem very likely.Russia  a Security Council member  would veto any vote there. No deal can be achieved while the war is still going on. And no case has been brought before the court  and if it were  international law argues against confiscating the Russian Central Bank’s assets  an act that would be a breach of its sovereignty  legal experts said.AdvertisementThe International Court of Justice ruled more than a decade ago that Italian domestic courts had violated modern Germany’s sovereignty by ordering reparations related to Nazi-era forced labor.“In order to avoid risks for one single jurisdiction  it has to be a well-crafted  coordinated and orchestrated move between Western nations ” said Douglas Rediker  a senior fellow with the Washington-based Brookings Institution. “And that’s hard to get. The major issue is that central bank assets are supposed to be sacrosanct. It’s about state sovereignty.”In the United States  Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told Congress last month that confiscating Russian assets frozen in the United States would probably require a change to US law.European officials assessed in a confidential report  seen by The New York Times  that there was “no credible legal avenue allowing for the confiscation of frozen or immobilized assets on the sole basis of these assets being under EU restrictive measures.”Also in Explained | https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-global/how-russia-is-tackling-ukraine-counteroffensive-8861598/What are the options?AdvertisementAs the options have dwindled  the European Commission  the bloc’s executive arm  has focused on what it described as the safest solution.The latest idea is to use profits earned by Europe-based financial companies that are holding the assets and channel those profits to Ukraine. According to the commission  this option could generate about 3 billion euros ($3.3 billion) per year.AdvertisementThat way  the sum of Russian assets initially frozen would be unaffected in case someday they need to be returned.Most of the frozen assets are held by Euroclear  a large Brussels-based financial services company that is a critical part of the plumbing of financial markets and deals with international transactions and safekeeping of assets for central banks and global commercial banks.AdvertisementBecause of sanctions  earnings related to the assets have been blocked from going back to Russia. Instead  the money from those transactions has been accumulating on Euroclear’s balance sheet  increasing it by about 125 billion euros since the war began.In keeping with regulatory requirements  Euroclear has invested the additional money and earned about 1.7 billion euros in the first half of the year  the company said last week.Under normal circumstances  the company would decide what to do with that money. But given the uncertainties generated by the war  the company’s board said it had decided to set those profits aside.Euroclear said it was concerned with minimizing “potential legal  technical and operational risks” that could come from the commission’s proposals.The company’s profits have already been taxed by Belgium  where it is based  per existing law  bringing in around $111 million  which Prime Minister Alexander de Croo vowed to transfer to Ukraine.But the European Commission’s proposal would substantially increase the takings from the profits  thereby increasing what could be transferred to Ukraine.Alternatively  some former Biden administration officials have proposed using Russia’s frozen assets creatively so that they can benefit Ukraine  without being directly transferred to it.One idea put forward by Daleep Singh  a former deputy national security adviser for international economics  is to place the immobilized assets into an escrow account that can be used by Ukraine as collateral for new bonds it could issue.If Ukraine can successfully repay the debt — over a period of anywhere between 10 and 30 years — then Russia could potentially have its frozen assets back.What are the lingering concerns?Even the latest EU idea  which the commission said would reduce legal and financial risks for Europe  has elicited concern from the European Central Bank and some of the bloc’s nations  which called for a more cautious approach.With the summer deadline now passed  any proposal for a new law to make use of the Russian assets has been postponed to the fall.Although the profits of Euroclear that would be taxed are not owned by Russia  officials worry about damaging the euro’s reputation and sending a signal to foreign investors that their money is not safe in Europe.Without international coordination  investors could turn to other regions and currencies  such as the US dollar or Chinese renminbi  to place their money.Also in Explained | Soldiers in Niger claim to have overthrown President Bazoum: What we knowAn internal report drafted last month by European officials  and seen by the Times  listed the ECB’s concerns. “The implications could be substantial according to the ECB ” the report said. “It may lead to a diversification of reserves away from euro-denominated assets  increase of financing costs for European sovereigns and lead to trade diversification.”About $2 trillion worth of global reserves are held in euros  the second most popular currency after the U.S. dollar.The commission argued that the risk was already taken when Ukraine’s allies decided to freeze the Russian assets and that under the proposed plan  those assets would remain intact and could potentially be recovered in the future  protecting Europe from any legal action by Moscow.Taxing the profits generated by investing the assets should “not affect the financial stability of the Union ” European officials wrote in the confidential report  and “would considerably reduce the legal risks.”President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine has repeatedly made the moral case for more decisive action regarding Russian assets  and his pleas have been echoed by Eastern European nations  like Poland  which have led the calls to punish Russia.“Potential aggressors must see this and remember that the world can be strong ” he said this year at a meeting with Yellen and chiefs of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.But Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg said last month that any measure regarding the Russian assets had to be “absolutely watertight.”“We are defending a rules-based international order ” Schallenberg said in an interview with Bloomberg. “If any of these actions were to be lifted by a judge  it would be a diplomatic and economic disaster.”,negative,0.03,0.2,0.77,mixed,0.1,0.24,0.67,True,English,"['Europe', 'Russia', 'war', 'large Brussels-based financial services company', 'Ursula

By doing so  we continue to actively participate in the expansion and renewal of the healthcare real estate portfolio in Europe while pursuing measures to achieve our ESG objectives.""PRESS RELEASEREGULATED INFORMATIONBrussels  28.07.2023  7:30 a.m. CET1. Interim management report1.1. Summary of activity since 01.01.2023Cofinimmo has been acquiring  developing and managing rental properties for almost 40 years. Attentive to societal changes  Cofinimmo's permanent objective is to offer high-quality care  living and working spaces ('Caring  Living and Working - Together in Real Estate'). Capitalising on its expertise  Cofinimmo consolidates its leadership in European healthcare real estate.The pandemic that the world has been experiencing in recent years has highlighted the importance of the healthcare segment for each and every one of us. Through its investments  Cofinimmo is actively participating in the operation  maintenance  extension and renewal of the healthcare property portfolio in nine countries.During the first half-year  Cofinimmo made several investments (for 177 million EUR)  in line with the outlook1  mainly in various healthcare real estate sub-segments in Europe. Thanks to these operations  healthcare real estate assets (4.5 billion EUR) account for 73% of the group's consolidated portfolio as at 30.06.2023  which reaches 6.2 billion EUR.Cofinimmo constantly evaluates its assets portfolio based on the key points of its strategy and the available market opportunities. In this context  the group carried out disposals for 128 million EUR  in line with the outlook  contributing to the reduction by 1.0% of the debt-to-assets ratio. These are noticeable in the office and property of distribution networks segments (where the Cofinimur I portfolio of insurance agencies in France represents only 0.03% of the consolidated portfolio as at 30.06.2023  after disposals of more than 15 million EUR in 2023 and nearly 110 million EUR cumulatively since the process was launched in 2021). The cumulative amount of divestments carried out since 01.01.2023 and those already signed and expected to be closed by the end of the financial year amounts to nearly 200 million EUR.Cofinimmo has been adopting a proactive ESG policy for almost 15 years now. This is a real priority for the group  which once again distinguished itself in 2023. At the beginning of the year  Cofinimmo was selected to be one of the 'Top SBTi 1.5°C ESG Bond Issuers' and was included in the new Euronext Bel ESG Index. On 20.04.2023  Cofinimmo's ESG efforts were praised by the international financial press (Financial Times)  with the group being the only real estate company  among 8 Belgian groups  listed in the 500 Europe's Climate Leaders. In addition  during the half-year  Cofinimmo further improved its ESG performance with two new BREEAM certifications in Spain and the renewal of several ESG labels.In terms of financing  Cofinimmo reinforced its financial resources and its balance sheet structure during the last two financial years (cumulative capital increases of 565 million EUR in 2021 and 114 million EUR in 2022)  and again during this financial year (non-budgeted capital increases through optional dividend in the 2nd quarter and contributions in kind in the 3rd quarter  totalling nearly 80 million EUR). The financing operations during this period enabled the group to improve the maturity timetable of its financial debts  to increase the amount of available financing and to maintain an average cost of debt at particularly low levels. In this respect  Cofinimmo carried out in January the last early refinancing for 2023 (90 million EUR)  to bring its maturity to 2030; there are therefore no further long-term debt maturities in 2023. The interest rate risk is hedged at 99% as at 30.06.2023 through the use of IRS and caps; the expected ratio for the period 2023-2027 is also high  ranging from 85% to 100% depending on the year.

This press release  and the information it contains  does not constitute an offer to sell or subscribe  or the solicitation of an order tobuy or subscribe for ENOGIA shares in any country. Resounding success of the capital increase with preferential subscription rights in a total amount close to €4.6 million Overall demand of €6.7 million  i.e. oversubscription of around 170% Strengthened governance with investments by Éric Blanc-Garin and Yazid Sabeg and seats for them on the Board of Directors ENOGIA well positioned to accelerate its commercial development in a buoyant market Gross proceeds of €4 590 896 from the TransactionFull exercise of the extension clauseIssue of 2 295 448 new shares at a price of €2.00 per shareDuna & Cie (holding company jointly owned by Éric Blanc-Garin and Yazid Sabeg) holds 11.93% of the capital following the Transaction Marseille  28 July 2023 – 6 p.m. ENOGIA (ISIN code: FR0014004974 – ticker: ALENO)  an expert in micro-turbomachinery for the energy transition  is announcing the resounding success of its capital increase in cash with preferential subscription rights (the “Transaction”) in a total amount close to €4.6 million after full exercise of the extension clause. This fundraising is accompanied by investments in the company by Éric Blanc-Garin and Yazid Sabeg  who now hold 11.93% of the capital and 8.58% of the voting rights via their jointly owned holding company  Duna & Cie  and who will now occupy two seats out of a total of seven on the Board of Directors. Arthur Leroux  ENOGIA Chairman and CEO  said:“We are delighted with the great success of this capital increase  which attracted support from existing shareholders as well as from new investors such as Éric Blanc-Garin and Yazid Sabeg  two seasoned entrepreneurs who will now support ENOGIA in its commercial development and the acceleration of its growth  as well as entrepreneurs from Région Sud. On behalf of our employees  I would like to thank them for their confidence. Together  we are going to use this new round of funding to achieve ENOGIA’s aim of becoming the undisputed leader in turbomachinery for the ecological transition  thanks to its technological lead in converting heat into electricity.” Stronger financial position and governance to drive ENOGIA’s commercial development The great success of the capital increase enables ENOGIA to strengthen its financial situation and gives it the means necessary to accelerate and redeploy its commercial activities. To take advantage of the underlying trend favourable to the recovery of waste heat via ORC modules  and in particular to accelerate the rollout of the Green Shield Power Solution model  an ultra-competitive offer dedicated to the economy of use (which enables manufacturers to secure their local supply of renewable energy at very attractive prices)  ENOGIA plans to extend its footprint in Europe and its capacity to drive its distribution network. In view of the company’s cost structure  the continuation of strong sales momentum should enable ENOGIA to significantly accelerate its path towards profitability thanks to strong operating leverage resulting in positive free cash flow from 2025. As indicated in conjunction with its announcement  the success of the Transaction has also strengthened ENOGIA’s corporate governance  with the co-option of two new members to the Board of Directors  namely Éric Blanc-Garin and Yazid Sabeg  to replace Alexandre Carré de Malberg and Faurecia Ventures  who will continue to provide the company with their expertise as non-voting directors. Éric Blanc-Garin and Yazid Sabeg will support ENOGIA’s development by contributing their great expertise in the industrial and financial fields. Success of the capital increase with preferential subscription rights The Transaction was implemented pursuant to the eighth resolution of the Combined General Meeting of Shareholders of 9 June 2023  at a price of €2.00 per share  representing a discount of 45.8% to the closing price of ENOGIA shares on 7 July 2023 (€3.69) and 36.04% to ENOGIA’s ex-rights share price. At the end of the subscription period  which closed on 25 July 2023  subscription requests totalled 3 359 560 shares representing an amount of €6 719 120  i.e. oversubscription of 168% of the initial amount of the capital increase  breaking down as follows: - 1 866 430 new shares on a non-reducible basis; - 1 358 857 new shares on a reducible basis; and - 134 273 new shares on an unrestricted basis. In view of the strong demand  it was decided to exercise the extension clause in full  with 299 406 additional shares  thereby increasing the number of new shares issued from 1 996 042 to 2 295 448. The gross amount of the Transaction  share premium included  is therefore €4 590 896  resulting in the issue  with preferential subscription rights  of 2 295 448 new ordinary shares: non-reducible subscriptions of €3 732 860 corresponding to the issue of 1 866 430 new ordinary shares reducible subscriptions of €858 036 corresponding to the issue of 429 018 new ordinary shares. Demand on a reducible basis was partially allocated using an allocation coefficient of 0.48152847 calculated on the basis of the number of preferential subscription rights presented in support of non-reducible subscriptions  without taking account of fractions and without it being possible for the allocation to be greater than the number of shares requested on a reducible basis. No requests for subscription of new shares on an unrestricted basis were satisfied. Firm subscription commitments  in a total amount of €2.7 million  were satisfied as follows: DUNA & Cie  a company owned by Éric Blanc-Garin and Yazid Sabeg  having pledged €1 500 000  was allocated 750 000 shares representing €1 500 000;SC EVRAL  a company owned by Antoine Lepilleur  having pledged €100 000  was allocated 50 000 shares  representing €100 000;the two directors of ENOGIA  existing shareholders and other investors  having pledged €950 000  were allocated 168 879 shares  representing €337 758;entrepreneurs from Région Sud  Holding MVM  Unitel France (Kevin Polizzi)  Upperside (Philippe Véran) and Christophe Baralotto  having pledged €155 000  were allocated 77 500 shares  representing €155 000; Impact of the Transaction on ENOGIA’s capital On completion of the Transaction  including full exercise of the extension clause  the company’s share capital of €628 753.2 will consist of 6 287 532 ordinary shares.

X-Press Feeders will be the first common feeder operator with methanol fueled vessels on the water in Europe.The partnership between the world's largest green methanol producer and world's largest common feeder operator will create an end-to-end solution for global shipping companies in European ports. Earlier this year OCI announced its partnership with Unibarge to retrofit the first methanol powered bunker barge which will be deployed at the Port of Rotterdam. OCI will work with Unibarge to fuel X-Press Feeders' feeder ships ensuring the decarbonization of another link in the chain.The announcement comes in the same month the International Maritime Organization (IMO) announced new global decarbonization targets for the maritime industry and its revised strategy for the industry to reach net zero 'by or around 2050'. The partnership represents a concrete step towards both companies' decarbonization journeys and is a significant commercial-scale green methanol deal that validates green methanol as the leading choice for low carbon and renewable marine fuel available at scale today.This is OCI HyFuels' second green methanol sale in the marine sector in just under a month following our partnership with Maersk to fuel the world's first green methanol-powered container vessel  reflecting the speed of growth of the sector and OCI HyFuels' ability to support the growing demand for green methanol from the marine sector  starting in Rotterdam with plans to expand to several other ports around the world.Bashir Lebada  CEO of OCI Methanol / OCI HyFuels said:""With growing public and regulatory pressure on the shipping industry  we need to find ways to decarbonize every link in the chain. Through our new partnership with X-Press Feeders to supply them with OCI Hyfuels green methanol  and our existing collaboration with Unibarge to deliver the fuel via their green methanol bunker barge  we are creating an end-to-end decarbonization solution for the maritime industry in Europe. This announcement is yet another milestone in an exciting year for OCI HyFuels and our leadership in the maritime fuels sector. As the world's largest green methanol producer  we're excited to be pioneering ways to reduce emissions across the supply chain.""Shmuel Yoskovitz  CEO of X-Press Feeders said:""X-Press Feeders' partnership with OCI and the procurement of green methanol is the next logical decision in our journey towards our decarbonisation goal of Net Zero 2050. In Q2 2024 we will receive our first of 14 dual fuel Methanol vessels  the advance procurement of green methanol allows us to offer the Main Line Operators and interested European Beneficial Cargo Owners the ability to deliver an Intra-European green corridor by mid 2024. This is one more step to prove X-Press Feeders' commitment to deliver tangible contributions to a more sustainable shipping industry.

The results will assist competent authorities in assessing ING Group’s ability to meet applicable prudential requirements under stressed scenarios.The adverse stress test scenario was set by the ECB/ESRB and covers a three-year time horizon (2023- 2025). The stress test has been carried out applying a static balance sheet assumption as of December 2022  and therefore does not take into account future business strategies and management actions. It is not a forecast of ING Group’s profits.Under the hypothetical baseline scenario and EBA’s methodological instructions  ING Group would have a fully loaded common equity Tier 1 capital ratio (CET1) of 14.37% in 2025. Under the hypothetical adverse scenario and EBA’s methodological instructions  ING Group would have a fully loaded CET1 ratio of 8.92% in 2025.We regularly run our own ING specific stress test and based thereon remain comfortable with our management buffer and our capital ratio target of around 12.5% CET1.ING Group published an actual fully loaded CET1 ratio of 14.8% per 31 March 2023. For more information see the results on the EBA website.Note for editorsFor further information on ING  please visit www.ing.com.

The Group thus strengthened its position in this field with the acquisition of Eclair Préservation and Eclair Digital Services  a transaction finalized in early July 2023.The group also launched several new products and innovations:- its first complete offering of operated TV services integrating an Android BOX for operator Zeop - a new product combining TV and Cloud Gaming  in partnership with GameStream - several services on the Amazon Channel platform  in particular Gaumont Classique.In the second half of the year  the Netgem group will benefit from its various areas of organic growth  the momentum of its operator customers  its new development axis with publishers  and its new TV & Cloud Gaming offering for operators.In these conditions  Netgem is in a position to raise its ARR growth target to 30% for 2023.The Group is also pursuing its CSR policy in 2023  with in particular targets for limiting its carbon impact (-65% in H1 2023 on STB deliveries)  improving gender parity (target of 33% of women) within the new scope following the acquisition of Eclair Digital Services and Eclair Préservation  and sharing the value generated between shareholders and Group employees.Half-year results 2023IFRS DATAin million euros H1 2023 H1 2022 CHANGE Revenue 18.1 16.3 +11% Gross margin 10.0 9.6 +4% Opex 6.2 6.5 -5% EBITDA 3.8 3.2 +21% Current operating pro?t 0.2 (1.3)IFRS DATAin million of euros 2023 H1 2022 H1 Operating result 0.1 (1.3) Financial result (0.1) (0.1) Taxes 0.0 0.0 Net result(Group share) (0.1) (0.5)Growing subscribers base and sales  confirmed improvement in profitabilityNetgem saw marked growth in its subscribers base under management in the first half of 2023 (+26% vs. end of 2022) thanks to the momentum of its operator customers  particularly in Finland with Elisa  in the UK with Talk Talk  and also in Luxembourg with the switchover of POST to the NetgemTV platform.Revenue for H1 2023 amounts to €18.1M (H1 2022: €16.3M)  up 11% on the same period in 2022. ARR was €10.1M (H1 2022: €6.1M)  up 65%. This growth translates into a 4% increase in gross margin to €10M.Continued control of operating costs combined with growth in gross margin resulted in a 21% increase in Ebitda to €3.8M (H1 2022: €3.2M).Profit from recurring operations was positive at €0.2M (H1 2022: €(1.3)M). It remains impacted by the depreciation of assets identified in connection with the inclusion of Vitis in the scope of consolidation as from January 1  2020  as well as by the depreciation of equipment supplied to new subscribers. Group net income[3] came to €(0.1)M  compared with €(0.5)M for the first half of 2022. Overall net income broke even in H1 2023  compared with a loss of (€1.4M) in H1 2022.The Group's operations generated total cash flows of €4.6M over the first half of 2023  compared with €3.3M over the same period in 2022. Capital expenditures of €(5.2)M include capitalized equipment resulting from the growth in the subscribers base  the purchase of Vitis shares held by Caisse des Dépôts and Oceinde  and the impact of the sale of the fiber business to Nordnet. Cash flows from financing activities amounted to €3.2M  corresponding to the payment of the annual dividend in June 2023 and the reserved capital increase subscribed by Caisse des Dépôts and Manco.At June 30  2023  gross cash stood at €8.9M (€6.2M at year-end 2022) and net cash at €7.8M (€4.9M at year-end 2022). The cash position at the end of June includes resources generated by the €5M private placement  the buyout of minority interests in Vitis  and the payment of €1.5M in dividends. The finalization of the EP and EDS acquisition for a net consideration of €3.6M was completed at the beginning of July and is not included in these figures  nor is an addtional payment of €0.5M for the sale of the Fibre business  expected at the end of July.GovernanceFollowing the arrival of new long-term shareholders  the Group's governance is evolving  with the replacement of Virginie Banet by Alexandra Barth  appointed by cooptation of the Board of Directors.Alexandra Barth is an Investment Director at Caisse des Dépôts since 2011.

Fossalta di Portogruaro  28 July 2023 - The Board of Directors ofZignago Vetro S.p.A- a company listed on the Euronext STAR Milan market - in a meeting held today chaired by Nicolò Marzotto  approved the Group 2023Half-YearReport. Company profile The Zignago Vetro Group companies produce high quality glass containers for the Food and Beverage  Cosmetics and Perfumery industries and Speciality Glass bottles for wines and spirits  for the domestic and international markets. The Group is also strongly committed to the recovery and reuse of cullet  and is a leading operator in this sector in Italy. Glass is the only material that is 100% recyclable  infinitely and guaranteeing the new container is always of the same quality. Zignago Vetro Group operating performance Following the significant growth of 2022  Beverage and Food container demand was sustained in the first half of 2023  while however normalising in the second quarter. This has allowed the Group companies to replenish inventory levels  which at the end of 2022 had fallen to very low levels. Global Cosmetics and Perfumery markets demand generally remained strong across all segments  and particularly for the major cosmetic brands and Premium perfumery  driven both by the better quality levels demanded on the US and by growth on the Chinese market. We consider the trend outlined above to reflect the normal short-term fluctuations that are a feature of the glass container market  which  moreover  continues to demonstrate great solidity. The market's medium to long-term growth characteristics and the strong prospects for the use of glass as a packaging material that is increasingly appreciated  both by users and consumers  remain absolutely unchanged. This fact demonstrates the greater focus and appreciation that public opinion reserves for this extraordinary material  as an excellent choice for packaging  in view of its singular characteristics of healthiness  sturdiness  conservation  recyclability and sustainability. Consolidated revenues in the first half of 2023 totalled Euro 384.8 million compared to Euro 299.6 million in the same period of the previous year (+28.4%). Export revenues totalled Euro 122.7 million  comprising 31.9% of revenues (Euro 91.8 million and 30.6% in H1 2022). 2Consolidated EBITDA in the first half of 2023 amounted to Euro 120.4 million  +87.8% on H1 2022 (Euro 64.1 million)  with a 31.3% margin (21.4% in H1 2022). Consolidated EBIT was Euro 85.6 million (compared to Euro 34 million in the first half of 2022  +151.5%)  with a margin of 22.3% (11.4% in the first half of 2022). The consolidated Operating profit was Euro 87.1 million in H1 2023  compared to Euro 36.1 million in H1 2022 (+141.5%)  with a 22.6% revenue margin (compared to 12%). Consolidated Profit before taxes was Euro 83.2 million in H1 2023 (Euro 41.4 million in H1 2022  +101%)  with a margin of 21.6% (13.8%). Consolidated Profit in the period was Euro 74.6 million  compared to Euro 31.1 million in H1 2022 (+140.1%) - a margin of 19.4% (10.4%). Group balance sheet and financial position Group capital expenditure in the first half of 2023 amounted to Euro 23.6 million (Euro 44.6 million in H1 2022). Payments on fixed assets amounted to Euro 29 million in H1 2023 (Euro 52.3 million in H1 2022). The Group generated Free cash flow in H1 2023  before payments for investments and dividends of Euro 102.6 million (Euro 48.3 million in the first half of 2022). Free cash flow  after payments for investments (Euro 29 million) and dividends (Euro 53.3 million)  of Euro 73.6 million was generated  compared to an absorption of Euro 6.0 million in H1 2022. The Group net financial debt at 30 June 2023 was Euro 261.2 million  compared to Euro 284 million at 31 December 2022 (Euro 288.7 million at 30 June 2022). Group liquidity totalled Euro 97.1 million at 30 June 2023  compared to Euro 106 million at the end of 2022 and Euro 97.9 million at 30 June 2022. 3Outlook and subsequent events. Based on the available information  we expect Beverage and Food container withdrawals by operators to gradually normalise over the coming months  partly due to the retail system's need to replenish inventories  while the Cosmetics and Perfumery container market will remain dynamic  with demand at good levels  driven by the Premium segment and branded products. We remain confident in the strength and positive medium to long-term outlook for the glass container market  which shall follow the established historical trend. A gradual normalisation of the cost of most production factors also appears increasingly likely  and in particular of energy  while raw material costs - which remain high (particularly raw glass) - should show signs of reduction over the coming months. The margin outlook for the second half of the year will therefore be shaped by the development of all these factors and remain unchanged and positive. An awareness of market development  so as to optimise production capacity utilisation to serve demand  the modernisation and upgrading of facilities  the ongoing drive for greater productivity  the efficient use of resources - particularly energy - and cost containment continue to be key areas of focus for the Group companies. In addition  the Group is strongly committed to continuously improving its sustainability profile through a focus on investment  production factor utilisation and operating processes  aware of the importance of this aspect for the increasing adoption of glass in the near future. In the first half of 2023  the Group's Fossalta di Portogruaro and Empoli plants were awarded ISO 500001 certification. The medium/long-term glass container sector outlook  and of the Group in particular  remains unaltered and positive  confirming the consolidated development trajectory that the glass container market has historically shown and that appears increasingly robust due to the growing appreciation of glass among users and consumers. There were no significant events after 30 June 2023. *********************** Declaration The Executive Responsible for Financial Reporting  Mr. Roberto Celot  declares in accordance with Article 154 bis  paragraph 2  of the Consolidated Finance Act  that the accounting information contained in this press release corresponds to the underlying accounting documents  records and accounting entries. *********************** 2023 Half-Year Report The 2023 Half-Year Report will be made available to the public as soon as available and in accordance with law at the registered office of the company and on the company website at www.zignagovetro.com  and at the authorised storage mechanism 1Info at www.1info.it. *********************** 4,neutral,0.0,0.99,0.0,positive,0.69,0.3,0.01,True,English,"['Zignago Vetro S', 'ZV PR', 'ZIGNAGO VETRO S.P.A.

The results will assist competent authorities in assessing ING Group’s ability to meet applicable prudential requirements under stressed scenarios.The adverse stress test scenario was set by the ECB/ESRB and covers a three-year time horizon (2023- 2025). The stress test has been carried out applying a static balance sheet assumption as of December 2022  and therefore does not take into account future business strategies and management actions. It is not a forecast of ING Group’s profits.Under the hypothetical baseline scenario and EBA’s methodological instructions  ING Group would have a fully loaded common equity Tier 1 capital ratio (CET1) of 14.37% in 2025. Under the hypothetical adverse scenario and EBA’s methodological instructions  ING Group would have a fully loaded CET1 ratio of 8.92% in 2025.We regularly run our own ING specific stress test and based thereon remain comfortable with our management buffer and our capital ratio target of around 12.5% CET1.ING Group published an actual fully loaded CET1 ratio of 14.8% per 31 March 2023.

Cables accounted for approximately 19% of the Group's sales and copper accounts for approximately 60% of the composition of cables. This exposure is indirect since cable prices also reflect copper suppliers' commercial policies and the competitive environment in the Group's markets. Changes in copper prices have an estimated so-called ""recurring"" effect and an estimated so called ""non-recurring"" effect on the Group's performance assessed as part of the monthly internal reporting process of the Rexel Group: i) the recurring effect related to the change in copper-based cable prices corresponds to the change in value of the copper part included in the sales price of cables from one period to another. This effect mainly relates to the Group’s sales; ii) the non-recurring effect related to the change in copper-based cable prices corresponds to the effect of copper price variations on the sales price of cables between the time they are purchased and the time they are sold  until all such inventory has been sold (direct effect on gross profit). Practically  the non-recurring effect on gross profit is determined by comparing the historical purchase price for copper-based cable and the supplier price effective at the date of the sale of the cables by the Rexel Group. Additionally  the non-recurring effect on EBITA corresponds to the non-recurring effect on gross profit  which may be offset  when appropriate  by the non-recurring portion of changes in the distribution and administrative expenses.The impact of these two effects is assessed for as much of the Group’s total cable sales as possible  over each period. Group procedures require that entities that do not have the information systems capable of such exhaustive calculations to estimate these effects based on a sample representing at least 70% of the sales in the period. The results are then extrapolated to all cables sold during the period for that entity. Considering the sales covered. the Rexel Group considers such estimates of the impact of the two effects to be reasonable.This document may contain statements of future expectations and other forward-looking statements.

They grew in the quarter at c. 5x the pace of the traditional ED business  above the Power Up 2025 ambition to grow those businesses at twice the pace of the ED businessVolumes were positive in all geographies in the quarter driven by mega trends. Volumes were up +4.4% in North America  boosted by reshoring of industrial production  and +2.4% in Europe from electrification and more specifically Solar  EV and HVACThe +4.7% of non-cable price increases resulted from both carry-over effect (lower than in Q1 23) and from additional selling price increases in the Q2 23. Overall  most product categories benefited from significant price increases  except conduits in North America and some industrial automation products in China. We expect to further increase prices in the second part of the yearThe (1.8)% cable price evolution reflects the lower copper price in Q2 23 compared to Q2 22.We posted further growth in digitalization in all three geographies  with digital sales now representing 27.7% of sales  up +295bps compared to Q2 2022.

By market  we seized the robust industrial demand driven by production reshoring and O&G segment  offsetting negative trends in residential. We also benefited from the strong resilience of our commercial activity thanks to our very diversified portfolio and the solid backlog. By region  the market share gains in California & Gulf Central offset lower demand in the Northwest and Northeast. By business  the growth was boosted by the project activities from good backlog execution that benefited from lower supply chain pressure. The backlog at end-June 2023 remains high  still representing 3 months of sales; up 3.6% vs end Q2 22 and 2.8% below end of Q1 2.(82% of the region’s sales)  sales were up +4.2% in Q2 2023.

Cables accounted for approximately 19% of the Group's sales and copper accounts for approximately 60% of the composition of cables. This exposure is indirect since cable prices also reflect copper suppliers' commercial policies and the competitive environment in the Group's markets. Changes in copper prices have an estimated so-called ""recurring"" effect and an estimated so called ""non-recurring"" effect on the Group's performance assessed as part of the monthly internal reporting process of the Rexel Group: i) the recurring effect related to the change in copper-based cable prices corresponds to the change in value of the copper part included in the sales price of cables from one period to another. This effect mainly relates to the Group’s sales; ii) the non-recurring effect related to the change in copper-based cable prices corresponds to the effect of copper price variations on the sales price of cables between the time they are purchased and the time they are sold  until all such inventory has been sold (direct effect on gross profit). Practically  the non-recurring effect on gross profit is determined by comparing the historical purchase price for copper-based cable and the supplier price effective at the date of the sale of the cables by the Rexel Group. Additionally  the non-recurring effect on EBITA corresponds to the non-recurring effect on gross profit  which may be offset  when appropriate  by the non-recurring portion of changes in the distribution and administrative expenses.The impact of these two effects is assessed for as much of the Group’s total cable sales as possible  over each period. Group procedures require that entities that do not have the information systems capable of such exhaustive calculations to estimate these effects based on a sample representing at least 70% of the sales in the period. The results are then extrapolated to all cables sold during the period for that entity. Considering the sales covered. the Rexel Group considers such estimates of the impact of the two effects to be reasonable.This document may contain statements of future expectations and other forward-looking statements.

This is illustrated by the tenders benefiting Parrot and the recurring orders received from government institutions and armed forces. This client segment is part of a slow-moving administrative structure  faced with an economic slowdown  and the timeframe for recording major orders is currently uncertain.

Our robust H1 organic growth prompted an upgrade to our full-year outlook  and our operating margin more than tripled compared to H1 last year  thanks to strong execution of our transformative initiatives. While we improved our underlying operational cash generation by €144 million  our free cash flow reflects the intense pace of delivery on our major transformative actions carried out through 2023  including margin expansion through restructuring and tackling underperforming contracts  internal carve-out and working capital normalization. We have achieved key milestones in our strategic project  notably the successful completion of separating our internal operations into two entities  enabling us to sharpen our focus  enhance our agility and better serve our customers. Within a 12-month timeframe  we have also fully secured our €700 million disposal program of non-core businesses  which has streamlined our portfolio and contributed to the financing of our ongoing transformation. We would like to express our gratitude to all Atos teams for their unwavering dedication and commitment  which have played a decisive role in the results achieved so far.”In € million H1 2023 H1 2022 Revenue 5 548 5 563 Organic growth +2.3% -2.1% Growth at constant currency +0.5% -0.6% Operating Margin 212 59 In % of revenue 3.8% 1.1% OMDA 487 369 In % of revenue 8.8% 6.6% Normalized Net income (loss) -113 -119 Net income (loss) -600 -503 Free Cash Flow -969 -555 Net debt 2 321 1 792H1 2023 performance highlightsStrong commercial traction in Q2Commercial traction improved significantly in Q2  with a 112% Book-to-bill at the Group level  compared to 73% in Q1. The implementation of distinct go-to-market strategies for the two perimeters is producing tangible results.Eviden’s book-to-bill was 119% in Q2  well balanced between Digital  Big Data and Cybersecurity  with a solid order entry (+50% vs. Q1 2023) showcasing the strong differentiating factors that set Eviden apart  including unique secured cloud migration capabilities and deep expertise in selected industries. As an illustration Eviden won a contract with a major healthcare company in the US for public cloud migration combining application development and cybersecurity. In Q2  Eviden also continued to focus on short-term revenue generation contracts (48% of Q2 order entry was made of contracts with durations below 18 months).Tech Foundations’ book-to-bill was 106% in Q2  exceeding 100% for the first time since the business line was created in Q2 2022  compared to 67% last year. Tech Foundations began reaping the benefits of its refocused go-to-market strategy  improving fertilization of its top 100 accounts and successfully driving revenue retention  notably in the US where Tech Foundations secured major long-term contract renewals in Q2  demonstrating its ability to foster long-lasting customer relationships. As an example  Tech Foundations renewed a contract with the Texas Department of Information Resources for private cloud and mainframe-as-a-service  delivering adaptative  resilient and cost-effective services to over 35 state agencies.Robust organic revenue growthGroup revenue was €5 548 million in H1 2023  up +2.3% on an organic basis  as robust business trends continued into Q2. Eviden delivered +7.0% organic growth in H1 (+4.6% in Q2). Digital Security achieved strong growth  fueled by Eviden's leadership and innovation in cybersecurity. In June 2023  Eviden partnered with AWS to launch AIsaac Cyber Mesh  a cutting-edge cybersecurity detection and response solution powered by generative AI technologies. Advanced computing grew strongly  driven by HPC and high-end servers designed for artificial intelligence and machine learning. Despite some impacts from contract portfolio rationalization in H1 2023  Digital's organic growth improved significantly compared to the same period last year  driven by smart platforms and cloud transformation services  along with positive trends in the public sector in Europe.Tech Foundations’ core business revenue1 was broadly stable in H1 (-0.1% organic). The decline of Hybrid Cloud & Infrastructure continued to soften  while other core business lines posted moderate growth. Simultaneously  Tech Foundations remained committed to reducing non-core activities (BPO  hardware & software resale) as part of its ongoing portfolio reshaping efforts. UCC  in the process of being divested  grew its revenue in H1. As a result  Tech Foundations recorded a slight organic decrease of -1.6% in total revenue in H1 2023.At the Group level  changes in perimeter accounted for -1.7%  primarily reflecting the divestment of Atos Italian operations  finalized on April 3  2023  and of Russian activities in September 2022. Foreign exchange contributed-0.8%  mainly reflecting the depreciation of the Pound Sterling against the Euro over the period.Strong improvement in operating marginOperating margin was €212 million  or 3.8% of revenue  a strong improvement compared to H1 2022 (€59 million or 1.1% of revenue). Eviden’s operating margin was € 138 million  or 5.3% of revenue  a substantial increase compared to 3.5% in H1 2022. Despite continued cost inflation  Eviden demonstrated improvements across all activities  resulting from effective cost take-out actions  portfolio rationalization  and higher fixed costs absorption in Advanced Computing.Tech Foundations’ operating margin amounted to €73 million  or 2.5% of revenue  compared to -1.0% in H1 2022. Tech Foundations is making steady progress on its comprehensive margin expansion plan targeting €1.2 billion in gross benefits by 2026. As of June 2023  32% of this target has already been achieved  translating into a € 230 million gross increment in operating margin in H1 2023 alone  partly offset by cost inflation  backfills and revenue decrease. This achievement was primarily driven by 900 headcount reductions in high-cost countries during H1  bringing the total to c. 1 600 since the plan’s inception.Free cash flow and net debtAtos’ adjusted cash flow from operations2 showed a notable €144 million improvement  at €-200 million in H1 2023  compared to H1 2022 (€-344 million)  demonstrating the tangible progress made in enhancing the Group’s underlying operational cash generation through better OMDA and strict control of capital expenditure and leases. Including the impact of transformative actions and associated costs (€-274 million)  as well as a one-off working capital normalization impact in the context of the Group’s transformation (approximately €-250 million)  free cash flow was €-969 million in H1 2023.Net debt was €-2 321 million at the end of June 2023  compared to €-1 792 million at the end of June 2022.2023 full-year outlookIn 2023  Group revenue organic growth is now expected between 0.0% and +2.0% (previously: -1.0% to +1.0%)  with an acceleration of Eviden’s organic growth compared to 2022 and a managed reduction of Tech Foundations’ revenue resulting from portfolio reshaping.Group operating margin3 outlook remains unchanged  at 4% to 5%. Eviden’s operating margin is expected to increase compared to 2022  while Tech Foundations’ operating margin is expected in positive territories.Free cash flow for the full year is expected to remain broadly similar to that of H1.Major achievements in strategic transformation projectCompletion of operational carve-outAtos announces the completion of its internal operational carve-out within a 12-month timeframe. This is a decisive step in the execution of Atos’ strategic transformation project.Primary local carve-outs and underlying separation activities have been successfully executed in all countries4. These include legal entity operationalization  and the transfer of employees  contracts  assets and liabilities to new legal entities where legal and regulatory laws allow.As a result  Tech Foundations and Eviden are now fully operational as separate entities within the Atos Group. Each entity has a distinct operating model  go-to-market strategy and a focused portfolio  enabling them to cater to specific customer needs. Atos has therefore completed the rollout of its new client-centric organization fostering innovation  performance and consistent value delivery to all of the Group’s stakeholders.€700 million divestment program fully secured and expanded by an additional €400 millionOn July 3rd  2023  Atos announced it had entered into exclusive negotiations with Schneider Electric for the sale of 100% of EcoAct. This proposed transaction  combined with the other divestments already successfully closed or secured  would allow Atos to complete its non-core businesses divestment program of €700 million set during the Group's Capital Markets Day on June 14  2022. This achievement highlights Atos' determination to swiftly execute this program  which streamlines the Group’s portfolio and contributes to the financing of its ongoing transformation.When devising its divestment program and refining the scope of its two future entities  the Group identified additional opportunities to rationalize its portfolio  which have already garnered expressions of interests. As a result  the divestment program is expanded by an additional €400 million.Human resourcesTotal headcount was 107 013 at the end of June 2023  down -3.4% compared to 110 797 at the end of December 2022 (-1.9% organically).In H1 2023  Atos hired 8 431 new employees (gross)  effectively offsetting voluntary attrition  which stood at 18% at the end of June on a trailing twelve-month basis  and 15% in Q2 alone. The reduction in Group headcount was due to restructuring and performance-related terminations  resulting in 2 404 exits in H1. Additionally  the divestment of Atos Italia in Q2 2022 accounted for a reduction of 1 647 employees.Operating Margin to Operating IncomeIn € million H1 2023 H1 2022 Operating margin 212 59 Reorganization -430 -73 Rationalization and associated costs -30 -33 Integration and acquisition costs -4 -18 Total RRI costs -464 -124 Amortization of intangible assets (PPA from acquisitions) -60 -67 Equity based compensation -14 -11 Impairment of goodwill and other non-current assets -55 -91 Other items -53 -64 Operating income (loss) -434 -298Operating income was €-434 million in the first half of 2023  compared to €-298 million in the first half of 2022.Reorganization costs amounted to €-430 million in H1 2023  reflecting intensified workforce adaptation actions  within Tech Foundations  including the accrual of a restructuring plan in Germany  as well as within Eviden. They also included one-off costs associated with the internal carve-out  which was successfully finalized in July 2023.Other items amounted to €-53 million in the first half of 2023  compared to €-64 million in the first half of 2022  and included legal costs and the impacts of a vendor contract renegotiation.Operating income to Net income Group shareIn € million H1 2023 H1 2022 Operating income (loss) -434 -298 Net financial income (expense) -103 -129 Tax charge -65 -77 Share of net profit (loss) of equity-accounted investments 2 - Net Income Group Share -600 -503 Normalized Net Income Group Share -113 -119 Basic earning per share -5 42 -4 55 Diluted earning per share -5 42 -4 55Net financial expense amounted to €-103 million in the first half of 2023  compared to €-129 million in the first half of 2022 (which included a €-109 million loss related to the disposal of Worldline shares in June 2022). Cost of net financial debt increased to €-40 million in the first half of 2023  compared to €-13 million in the first half of 2022.Free cash flow and net debtIn € million H1 2023 H1 2022 Operating Margin before Depreciation and Amortization (OMDA) 487 369 Capital expenditures -110 -123 Lease payments -181 -207 Change in working capital requirement -645 -383 Cash flow from operation (CFO) -450 -344 Adjusted CFO – excl.

This demonstrates the tangible progress made by Atos in enhancing its underlying operational cash generation.Reorganization  rationalization and integration costs amounted to €-274 million  reflecting the ramp-up of transformative actions and associated costs.Other changes  for €-165 million  included costs incurred on legacy onerous contracts for which provisions were recorded in 2021 and in 2022.Items below free cash flow mainly included proceeds from disposals for €218 million and a negative €-59 million impact from foreign exchange fluctuations.Net debt position as of June 2023 was €-2 321 million (compared to €-1 792 million at the end of June 2022)  including €2.6 billion in gross cash. As of June 2023  Atos had access to €0.3 billion undrawn banking credit facilities.Condensed consolidated financial statementAtos Board of Directors in its meeting held on July 27  2023  has reviewed the Group half-year consolidated financial statements closed at June 30  2023.

The decline in Tech Foundations activities narrowed and was primarily attributable to a proactive reduction in underperforming contacts. Eviden’s activities remained robust despite an element of market slowdown  while numerous opportunities lie ahead in the cloud and security markets. Operating margin improved markedly to 10.1%  thanks to cost structure adaptation measures carried out in H2 2022.Northern Europe & APAC revenue was broadly stable year-on-year. Tech Foundations activities were slightly down due to the exit of a large BPO contract at the end of 2022  while the core business showed good resilience with the ramp-up of new contracts. Eviden’s activities were slightly up thanks to robust trends in Digital particularly in the public sector  while Advanced Computing contracted due to fluctuations in HPC and Lab-as-a-service revenue. Operating margin improved to 4.0% in H1 2023  thanks to management actions conducted in 2022 to improve delivery  reduce costs and increase pricing.Central Europe recorded a robust +4.8% organic growth (+2.4% at constant currency  primarily reflecting the exit of Russian operations in 2022). Eviden’s activities reported high growth across the board  partially offset by the decline of Tech Foundations’ activities driven by the reduction in value-added resale and a difficult infrastructure market in Germany. Operating margin turned positive at 1.3%  resulting from strong execution of Tech Foundations margin expansion plan  as well as higher margin on new business at Eviden.Southern Europe recorded a strong +6.8% organic growth. Growth was high at Eviden  driven by Advanced Computing with the delivery of a significant HPC contract in Spain  as well as Digital Security. Tech Foundations activities were flat as growth in Digital Workplace and Technology Advisory & Customized Services compensated for the deliberate reduction in value-added resale. Scope impacts represented -5.9%  primarily reflecting the divestment of Italian operations in Q2 2023. As a result  revenue growth at constant currency was +0.9%. Operating margin improved to 4.8% thanks to renegotiation of underperforming contracts.Others and global structures encompass Middle East  Africa  Major Events as well as two cost centers: the Group’s global delivery centers and global structures. Revenue grew +21.4% organically supported by by double-digit growth in Africa and Middle East and Turkey.

They mainly related to the exit of Russia in 2022  and in 2023 to the divesture of Italy  and to a lesser extent to the divestiture of EGSE and Sislog.Currency exchange rates effects negatively contributed to revenue for €-45 million and Operating margin for €-4 million.

Our robust H1 organic growth prompted an upgrade to our full-year outlook  and ouroperating margin more than tripledcompared to H1 last year  thanks to strong execution of our transformative initiatives.While we improved our underlying operational cash generation by €144 million  our free cash flow reflects theintense pace of delivery on our major transformative actions carried out through2023  including margin expansion through restructuring andtackling underperforming contracts internal carve-out andworking capital normalization.We have achieved key milestones in our strategic project  notably the successful completion of separating our internal operations into two entities  enabling us to sharpen our focus  enhance our agility and better serve our customers. Within a 12-month timeframe  we have also fully secured our €700 million disposal program of non-core businesses  which has streamlined our portfolio and contributed to the financing of our ongoing transformation. We would like to express our gratitude to all Atos teams for their unwavering dedication and commitment  which have played a decisive role in the results achieved so far.”In € million H1 2023 H1 2022 Revenue 5 548 5 563 Organic growth +2.3% -2.1% Growth at constant currency +0.5% -0.6% Operating Margin 212 59 In % of revenue 3.8% 1.1% OMDA 487 369 In % of revenue 8.8% 6.6% Normalized Net income (loss) -113 -119 Net income (loss) -600 -503 Free Cash Flow -969 -555 Net debt 2 321 1 792H1 2023 performance highlightsStrong commercial traction in Q2Commercial traction improved significantly in Q2  with a 112% Book-to-bill at the Group level  compared to 73% in Q1. The implementation of distinct go-to-market strategies for the two perimeters is producing tangible results.Eviden’s book-to-bill was 119% in Q2  well balanced between Digital  Big Data and Cybersecurity  with a solid order entry (+50% vs. Q1 2023) showcasing the strong differentiating factors that set Eviden apart  including unique secured cloud migration capabilities and deep expertise in selected industries. As an illustration Eviden won a contract with a major healthcare company in the US for public cloud migration combining application development and cybersecurity. In Q2  Eviden also continued to focus on short-term revenue generation contracts (48% of Q2 order entry was made of contracts with durations below 18 months).Tech Foundations’ book-to-bill was 106% in Q2  exceeding 100% for the first time since the business line was created in Q2 2022  compared to 67% last year. Tech Foundations began reaping the benefits of its refocused go-to-market strategy  improving fertilization of its top 100 accounts and successfully driving revenue retention  notably in the US where Tech Foundations secured major long-term contract renewals in Q2  demonstrating its ability to foster long-lasting customer relationships. As an example  Tech Foundations renewed a contract with the Texas Department of Information Resources for private cloud and mainframe-as-a-service  delivering adaptative  resilient and cost-effective services to over 35 state agencies.Robust organic revenue growthGroup revenue was €5 548 million in H1 2023  up +2.3% on an organic basis  as robust business trends continued into Q2. Eviden delivered +7.0% organic growth in H1 (+4.6% in Q2). Digital Security achieved strong growth  fueled by Eviden's leadership and innovation in cybersecurity. In June 2023  Eviden partnered with AWS to launch AIsaac Cyber Mesh  a cutting-edge cybersecurity detection and response solution powered by generative AI technologies. Advanced computing grew strongly  driven by HPC and high-end servers designed for artificial intelligence and machine learning. Despite some impacts from contract portfolio rationalization in H1 2023  Digital's organic growth improved significantly compared to the same period last year  driven by smart platforms and cloud transformation services  along with positive trends in the public sector in Europe.Tech Foundations’ core business revenue1 was broadly stable in H1 (-0.1% organic). The decline of Hybrid Cloud & Infrastructure continued to soften  while other core business lines posted moderate growth. Simultaneously  Tech Foundations remained committed to reducing non-core activities (BPO  hardware & software resale) as part of its ongoing portfolio reshaping efforts. UCC  in the process of being divested  grew its revenue in H1. As a result  Tech Foundations recorded a slight organic decrease of -1.6% in total revenue in H1 2023.At the Group level  changes in perimeter accounted for -1.7%  primarily reflecting the divestment of Atos Italian operations  finalized on April 3  2023  and of Russian activities in September 2022. Foreign exchange contributed-0.8%  mainly reflecting the depreciation of the Pound Sterling against the Euro over the period.Strong improvement in operating marginOperating margin was €212 million  or 3.8% of revenue  a strong improvement compared to H1 2022 (€59 million or 1.1% of revenue). Eviden’s operating margin was € 138 million  or 5.3% of revenue  a substantial increase compared to 3.5% in H1 2022. Despite continued cost inflation  Eviden demonstrated improvements across all activities  resulting from effective cost take-out actions  portfolio rationalization  and higher fixed costs absorption in Advanced Computing.Tech Foundations’ operating margin amounted to €73 million  or 2.5% of revenue  compared to -1.0% in H1 2022. Tech Foundations is making steady progress on its comprehensive margin expansion plan targeting €1.2 billion in gross benefits by 2026. As of June 2023  32% of this target has already been achieved  translating into a € 230 million gross increment in operating margin in H1 2023 alone  partly offset by cost inflation  backfills and revenue decrease. This achievement was primarily driven by 900 headcount reductions in high-cost countries during H1  bringing the total to c. 1 600 since the plan’s inception.Free cash flow and net debtAtos’ adjusted cash flow from operations2 showed a notable €144 million improvement  at €-200 million in H1 2023  compared to H1 2022 (€-344 million)  demonstrating the tangible progress made in enhancing the Group’s underlying operational cash generation through better OMDA and strict control of capital expenditure and leases. Including the impact of transformative actions and associated costs (€-274 million)  as well as a one-off working capital normalization impact in the context of the Group’s transformation (approximately €-250 million)  free cash flow was €-969 million in H1 2023.Net debt was €-2 321 million at the end of June 2023  compared to €-1 792 million at the end of June 2022.2023 full-year outlookIn 2023  Group revenue organic growth is now expected between 0.0% and +2.0% (previously: -1.0% to +1.0%)  with an acceleration of Eviden’s organic growth compared to 2022 and a managed reduction of Tech Foundations’ revenue resulting from portfolio reshaping.Group operating margin3 outlook remains unchanged  at 4% to 5%. Eviden’s operating margin is expected to increase compared to 2022  while Tech Foundations’ operating margin is expected in positive territories.Free cash flow for the full year is expected to remain broadly similar to that of H1.Major achievements in strategic transformation projectCompletion of operational carve-outAtos announces the completion of its internal operational carve-out within a 12-month timeframe. This is a decisive step in the execution of Atos’ strategic transformation project.Primary local carve-outs and underlying separation activities have been successfully executed in all countries4. These include legal entity operationalization  and the transfer of employees  contracts  assets and liabilities to new legal entities where legal and regulatory laws allow.As a result  Tech Foundations and Eviden are now fully operational as separate entities within the Atos Group. Each entity has a distinct operating model  go-to-market strategy and a focused portfolio  enabling them to cater to specific customer needs. Atos has therefore completed the rollout of its new client-centric organization fostering innovation  performance and consistent value delivery to all of the Group’s stakeholders.€700 million divestment program fully secured and expanded by an additional €400 millionOn July 3rd  2023  Atos announced it had entered into exclusive negotiations with Schneider Electric for the sale of 100% of EcoAct. This proposed transaction  combined with the other divestments already successfully closed or secured  would allow Atos to complete its non-core businesses divestment program of €700 million set during the Group's Capital Markets Day on June 14  2022. This achievement highlights Atos' determination to swiftly execute this program  which streamlines the Group’s portfolio and contributes to the financing of its ongoing transformation.When devising its divestment program and refining the scope of its two future entities  the Group identified additional opportunities to rationalize its portfolio  which have already garnered expressions of interests. As a result  the divestment program is expanded by an additional €400 million.Human resourcesTotal headcount was 107 013 at the end of June 2023  down -3.4% compared to 110 797 at the end of December 2022 (-1.9% organically).In H1 2023  Atos hired 8 431 new employees (gross)  effectively offsetting voluntary attrition  which stood at 18% at the end of June on a trailing twelve-month basis  and 15% in Q2 alone. The reduction in Group headcount was due to restructuring and performance-related terminations  resulting in 2 404 exits in H1. Additionally  the divestment of Atos Italia in Q2 2022 accounted for a reduction of 1 647 employees.Operating Margin to Operating IncomeIn € million H1 2023 H1 2022 Operating margin 212 59 Reorganization -430 -73 Rationalization and associated costs -30 -33 Integration and acquisition costs -4 -18 Total RRIcosts -464 -124 Amortization of intangible assets (PPA from acquisitions) -60 -67 Equity based compensation -14 -11 Impairment of goodwill and other non-current assets -55 -91 Other items -53 -64 Operating income (loss) -434 -298Operating income was €-434 million in the first half of 2023  compared to €-298 million in the first half of 2022.Reorganization costs amounted to €-430 million in H1 2023  reflecting intensified workforce adaptation actions  within Tech Foundations  including the accrual of a restructuring plan in Germany  as well as within Eviden. They also included one-off costs associated with the internal carve-out  which was successfully finalized in July 2023.Other items amounted to €-53 million in the first half of 2023  compared to €-64 million in the first half of 2022  and included legal costs and the impacts of a vendor contract renegotiation.Operating income to Net income Group shareIn € million H1 2023 H1 2022 Operating income (loss) -434 -298 Net financial income (expense) -103 -129 Tax charge -65 -77 Share of net profit (loss) of equity-accounted investments 2 - Net Income Group Share -600 -503 Normalized Net Income Group Share -113 -119 Basic earning per share -5 42 -4 55 Diluted earning per share -5 42 -4 55Net financial expense amounted to €-103 million in the first half of 2023  compared to €-129 million in the first half of 2022 (which included a €-109 million loss related to the disposal of Worldline shares in June 2022).

This demonstrates the tangible progress made by Atos in enhancing its underlying operational cash generation.Reorganization  rationalization and integration costs amounted to €-274 million  reflecting the ramp-up of transformative actions and associated costs.Other changes  for €-165 million  included costs incurred on legacy onerous contracts for which provisions were recorded in 2021 and in 2022.Items below free cash flow mainly included proceeds from disposals for €218 million and a negative €-59 million impact from foreign exchange fluctuations.Net debt position as of June 2023 was €-2 321 million (compared to €-1 792 million at the end of June 2022)  including €2.6 billion in gross cash.

The decline in Tech Foundations activities narrowed and was primarily attributable to a proactive reduction in underperforming contacts. Eviden’s activities remained robust despite an element of market slowdown  while numerous opportunities lie ahead in the cloud and security markets. Operating margin improved markedly to 10.1%  thanks to cost structure adaptation measures carried out in H2 2022.Northern Europe & APAC revenue was broadly stable year-on-year. Tech Foundations activities were slightly down due to the exit of a large BPO contract at the end of 2022  while the core business showed good resilience with the ramp-up of new contracts. Eviden’s activities were slightly up thanks to robust trends in Digital particularly in the public sector  while Advanced Computing contracted due to fluctuations in HPC and Lab-as-a-service revenue. Operating margin improved to 4.0% in H1 2023  thanks to management actions conducted in 2022 to improve delivery  reduce costs and increase pricing.Central Europe recorded a robust +4.8% organic growth (+2.4% at constant currency  primarily reflecting the exit of Russian operations in 2022). Eviden’s activities reported high growth across the board  partially offset by the decline of Tech Foundations’ activities driven by the reduction in value-added resale and a difficult infrastructure market in Germany. Operating margin turned positive at 1.3%  resulting from strong execution of Tech Foundations margin expansion plan  as well as higher margin on new business at Eviden.Southern Europe recorded a strong +6.8% organic growth. Growth was high at Eviden  driven by Advanced Computing with the delivery of a significant HPC contract in Spain  as well as Digital Security. Tech Foundations activities were flat as growth in Digital Workplace and Technology Advisory & Customized Services compensated for the deliberate reduction in value-added resale. Scope impacts represented -5.9%  primarily reflecting the divestment of Italian operations in Q2 2023. As a result  revenue growth at constant currency was +0.9%. Operating margin improved to 4.8% thanks to renegotiation of underperforming contracts.Others and global structures encompass Middle East  Africa  Major Events as well as two cost centers: the Group’s global delivery centers and global structures. Revenue grew +21.4% organically supported by by double-digit growth in Africa and Middle East and Turkey.

They mainly related to the exit of Russia in 2022  and in 2023 to the divesture of Italy  and to a lesser extent to the divestiture of EGSE and Sislog.Currency exchange rates effects negatively contributed to revenue for €-45 million and Operating margin for €-4 million. They mostly came from the depreciation of the Pound Sterling  the Argentine peso and the Turkish libra not compensated by the appreciation of the American dollar.Order entry BacklogOrder entry was €5.1 billion in H1 2023  representing a book-to-bill ratio of 93% (compared with 87% in H1 2022).

On strategy and balance sheet  progress on the portfolio refocus resulted in reduced debt  and the EBITDA increase in improved leverage. Combined with the extension of bank financing maturities  it results in a healthier balance sheet. I would like to recognize Ontex’s employees for embracing the accelerated execution of our strategic plans  and other stakeholders for their support and belief in Ontex’s turnaround. These early successes are a great inspiration to all of us to continue this journey to bring Ontex back to a leading position as preferred partner in retail and healthcare personal care.”[1] Reported P&L figures  represent continuing operations  i.e. Core Markets  only.

In baby care revenue grew 12% like for like compared to last year  driven by continued volume growth of baby pants in Europe. In adult care revenue growth was 19% like for like  with strong growth especially in the healthcare channel. Feminine care revenue grew 17% like for like. Including adverse forex  total revenue growth was up 14% year on year.Volume and mix changes were positive  adding 1%. Except in adult care  the overall demand in Europe is down  but retailer brands gain share  however  resulting in an overall flat evolution. Ontex outperformed in all categories in Europe. Ontex’s volumes in North America were lower year on year. Destocking by certain lifestyle customers impacted volumes and mix  especially in the first quarter.Prices were up 14% on average versus last year  with double digit price increases in all categories and major regions. Following the huge increase in raw material and other input costs  Ontex steadily rolled out price increases over the course of 2022 to mitigate the impact. While the majority of the year-on-year price increase is the effect of this  Ontex continued to execute additional pricing in the year to recover cumulative cost inflation.Forex fluctuations had a negative impact of -1%. The year-on-year depreciation of the British pound and Australian dollar offset the appreciation of the US dollar.Adjusted EBITDA of Core MarketsAdjusted EBITDA was €84 million  up 111% year on year and entirely driven by the relentless cost reduction efforts and the volume and mix improvement. Pricing offset the additional input cost inflation and adverse forex headwinds. The adjusted EBITDA margin rose to 9.4%  up 4.3pp year on year.While the volume and mix effect on revenue was limited  the operating leverage and improvement of the product mix  had a €7 million positive impact on the EBITDA.Operating cost reduction measures represented €35 million in savings  a reduction of the operational cost base by some 5%. Procurement initiatives and operational efficiency were the main drivers behind the improvement. SG&A costs were kept at 9% of sales  despite additional inflation.Cost inflation weighed heavily on the year-on-year comparison  with a negative impact of €70 million from raw materials  especially fluff and super-absorbent-polymers  and €24 million from other operating costs  including wage inflation. Although the year-on-year increase is slowing  the total cost base went up by close to 15% versus the first half of 2022  following the further increase in the second half and certain contract renewals at the start of this year.The strong pricing contributed €109 million year on year. While this more than offset the additional input cost inflation versus the previous year  it is not sufficient to compensate the cumulative cost increase incurred since the start of the inflation wave in 2021. Thereby continued adjustments including selective pricing are required.Forex fluctuations had a €(12) million net negative impact as the adverse impact on revenue was exacerbated by the year-on-year US dollar appreciation effect on input costs.Q2 BUSINESS REVIEW OF CONTINUING OPERATIONSRevenue of Core MarketsRevenue was €446 million  up 15% like for like versus the second quarter of 2022  driven by pricing across categories. In baby care revenue grew 15% like for like compared to last year  supported by baby pants and better sales in open diapers in Europe. In adult care revenue growth was 16% like for like  based on solid demand across product groups  both in healthcare and in retail channels. Feminine care revenue grew 18% like for like  with volume growth in tampons. Including adverse forex  the total revenue growth was up 13% year on year  and in line with the first quarter.Volume and mix had a 2% positive net impact. In Europe overall market is declining  except in adult care. Retailer brands continued to gain share  resulting in a stable performance  and Ontex outperformed in all categories in Europe. Ontex’s volumes in North America were lower in the quarter  due to continued destocking at certain lifestyle customers  but the effect is less pronounced than in the first quarter.Prices were up 13% on average versus last year  with double digit price increases in all categories and major regions  following the huge increase in raw material and other input costs. While the majority of the pricing in the quarter is the effect of the pricing implemented in the previous quarters  Ontex continued to execute additional sequential pricing to recover cumulative cost inflation in the quarter. The year on year price increase is less pronounced than in the first quarter as the roll-out in 2022 was gradual throughout the year  and thereby includes already higher prices in the second quarter of 2022.Forex fluctuations had a negative impact of -2%  as the British pound  the Australian dollar and especially the Russian ruble depreciated year on year in the period.Adjusted EBITDA of Core MarketsAdjusted EBITDA was €43 million  up 129% year on year  driven by volume growth and especially strong delivery of cost reduction measures. Pricing offset the additional input cost inflation and the adverse forex. Compared to the first quarter the adjusted EBITDA was up 6%. The adjusted EBITDA margin rose to 9.7%  by 4.9pp year on year and 0.6pp quarter on quarter.The volume and mix effect on EBITDA was €2 million and largely volume-driven.Operating cost reduction measures represented €20 million in savings  a reduction of the operational cost base by close to 6%. Procurement initiatives  operational efficiency and scrap rate reductions were the main drivers behind the improvement. SG&A costs over sales were kept at 9% as in the first quarter.Cost inflation weighed heavily on the year-on-year comparison  and increased with a negative impact of €31 million from raw materials  namely fluff and super-absorbent-polymers  and €7 million from other operating costs  including wage inflation. While  the year-on-year increase is slowing since the fourth quarter of 2022  the total cost base still increased by more than 10% year on year  and remained stable versus the first quarter.The continued pricing efforts contributed €51 million year on year. While this more than offset the additional input cost inflation versus the previous year  it does not cover the cumulative cost increase incurred since the start of the inflation wave in 2021 in all markets and categories. Thereby continued adjustments including selective pricing are required.Forex fluctuations had a €(11) million net negative impact due to the net negative effect on revenue  and the net exposure to the US dollar remained negative.H1 2023 FINANCIAL REVIEWP&LDepreciation was up 4% at €(36) million  reflecting the continued investments in growth.EBITDA adjustments were made for €(13) million. These adjust primarily for €(11) million restructuring costs to further optimize the European cost structure. This compares to EBITDA adjustments made for of €(90) million in the first half of 2022  when significant non-cash impairments were taken on the Russian assets.The net finance cost was €(25) million  €(3) million higher than in the first half of 2022  reflecting higher interest rates for the floating rate portion of the debt  which were partly offset by favorable currency effects.The income tax was €(9) million  compared to a positive €7 million a year ago  when the earnings before taxes were negative. The deducted tax rate is relatively high as the geographical mix of earnings does not allow to recognize all local losses.Discontinued operations generated a €(21) million loss for the period  compared to €(72) million a year ago. The adjusted EBITDA was €23 million  an improvement of 135%  with the Mexican business representing the majority in the four months it contributed prior to the finalization of its divestment. While the contribution from the remaining activities in Brazil and the Middle East was relatively lower  it represents a significant improvement from the losses incurred in 2022. Volumes were slightly down  compensated by mix improvement. EBITDA adjustments were made for €(26) million  adjusting mainly of a non-cash impairment of €(13) million on the Middle Eastern assets and €(11) million costs related to the divestment of the Mexican assets. Financial charges were €(8) million  slightly up year on year  due to higher interest rates  while taxes were €(10) million  doubling versus the year before  in line with higher profitability. Hyperinflation in Turkey impacted the results negatively by €(7) million.The adjusted profit from continuing operations was €12 million  compared to a €(11) million loss in 2022  reflecting the adjusted EBITDA recovery  more than offsetting the higher financial and tax charges. Including restructuring costs and the contribution of discontinued operations  the loss for the period for the Total Group was €(19) million  compared to €(171) million a year before  when the profitability was lower and significant non-cash impairments were taken in continuing and discontinued operations. Adjusted earnings per share of continuing operations were €0.15 compared to €(0.14) in 2022. Basic earnings per share of the Total Group were €(0.24)  compared to €(2.12) in 2022.CashCapital expenditure was €(44) million  representing 3.6% of the Total Group revenue  compared to 2.3% in the first half of 2022. Some 2/3rd of the investments relate to expansion in Europe and North America  as well as innovation and cost reduction measures across the Total Group. Whilst a strict capital management policy continues to be applied  a further increase in capex is anticipated in order to support Ontex’s transformation plans. The increase in investment pace approaches the 4% normalized rate for Ontex.Free cash flow was €4 million  compared to €(59) million in the first half of 2022. Cash generation from the strongly improved adjusted EBITDA  after deduction of €(12) million cash taxes  funded the increase in capex  as well as €(21) million working capital needs and €(14) million cash-out for restructuring and one-off legal costs.Balance sheetWorking capital for the Total Group at the end of the period was €125 million  a €51 million decrease versus the end of 2022  largely linked to the exit of the Mexican business. Working capital needs in the remaining operations increased due to the impact of higher raw materials and finished good prices  and a slight increase in days of outstanding inventory. The working capital includes monetization of accounts receivables through factoring for €188 million  versus €192 million at the end of 2022.Net financial debt of the Total Group was €658 million at the end of the period including lease liabilities of €129 million. The decrease from €867 million at the start of the year is entirely attributable to the divestment of the Mexican business activities early May  when €237 million proceeds were received from the acquirer  net of already paid transaction costs. The deferred proceeds of €40 million  which is still due within the next five years  were booked as non-current receivables. Cash-out for financing was €(33) million  consisting of €(26) million for net interest payments and €(7) million other financial costs. The latter include hedging costs as well as transaction costs related to the renegotiated revolving credit facility and the early repayment of the €220 million term loan.The leverage ratio of the Total Group at the end of the period was 4.5 times the adjusted EBITDA of the last twelve months  which now excludes the Mexican business contribution. The improvement compared to 6.4 times at the year start  is based on the significant increase of the adjusted EBITDA.The gross financial debt of the Total Group came down from €1 076 million to €835 million. The €220 million term loan was repaid with the Mexican business divestment proceeds. Leases were €129 million  slightly lower than the €138 million at the start of the year. The Revolving credit facility utilization remained largely unchanged at €116 million. This mainly covers temporary mismatches in the geographical cash distribution of the €177 million cash position. The facility was extended to December 2025 with a ceiling of €269 million until June 2024 and €242 million until maturity. The facility’s maintenance covenants were reviewed and require a.o. that the leverage ratio does not exceed 4.25 times by year end. Besides this  the principal component for the gross financial debt consists of the €580 million bond maturing in July 2026 with a fixed 3.5% interest rate.As from 2022  the Emerging Markets activities are reported as assets held for sale. The net value of these (assets minus related liabilities)  came down from €404 million at the year start to €129 million at the end of the period  reflecting the Mexican business divestment and some smaller asset sales.DisclaimerThis report may include forward-looking statements.

Favorable pricing and solid execution across the Group and especially in the Eastern Hemisphere drove robust profitability. In addition  efficient working capital management allowed us to continue to reduce our net debt  which now stands €521 million lower year-over-year. Net debt reduction remains a key focal point for Vallourec.“Our major capability enhancement program is progressing well in Brazil. We expect to drive meaningful improvements in thisoperation in 2024 as we exit this transformative period.“As we look into the second half of the year UStubes pricing has been on a downward trend  though it remains at healthy levels. We expect our volumes will trough in the third quarter as distributor inventories normalize  before improving again in the fourth quarter. We expect pricing will stabilize at healthy levels as market headwinds slow in the second half.“Outside of the US  demand for our tubular products remains strong  and pricing has continued to show an upward trend. We are capitalizing on this via our premium production hubs in Brazil and Asia  while continuing to wind down our tube productionactivities in Germany.“ Our Pau Branco iron ore mine has ramped up activity following the release of the Cachoeirinha waste pile  though we expect it will operate below its full potential in the second half of 2023. We have a plan in place to move our extraction activities towards already identified higher-quality reserves. Permitting is currently underway to execute this plan.“We recently provided an update to our full-year EBITDA objective. We expect to generate €950 million to €1.1 billion of EBITDA in 2023. While EBITDA in the second half of the year is expected to be lower than the first half  the New Vallourec plan is on track. Wecontinueto expect that  compared to 2021 the full €230 million annualized recurring benefit of this plan will be effective in Q22024.Finally  we intendto further reduce our net debt in the second half ofthis year. We reiterate our target to reach zero net debt by year-end 2025 at the latest  a key step in cycle-proofing our business.”Key Datain € million  unlessnoted Q2 2023 Q1 2023 Q2 2022 QoQchg. YoYchg.

The Group has no long-term debt repayments scheduled before June 2026.UPDATE ON THE PAU BRANCO IRON ORE MINEThe Pau Branco mine returned to higher production levels at the end of the second quarter of 2023 following the release of the Cachoeirinha waste pile. Production sold in the second half of 2023 is currently expected to be approximately 3.6 million tonnes  and production costs are expected to remain at the high end of the recent range for the time being. We are currently executing a plan to move our extraction activities to already identified higher-quality reserves over the next few quarters. Vallourec management is currently engaging with state and national regulators to obtain the required production and environmental permits.NEW VALLOUREC PLAN UPDATESThe New Vallourec plan  announced in May 2022  remains fully on track. The plan aims to generate €230 million of recurring EBITDA uplift versus 2021 and an approximately €20 million capex reduction with the full impact starting in Q2 2024. These actions will contribute to making the Group cycle-proof and generating positive free cash flowd  before the change in working capital  even at the bottom of the cycle.The closure of sites in Europe is slightly ahead of schedule  and we expect our German tube production operations will stop in Q4 2023. Employees at the sites to be closed in Europe began to leave the company in Q1 2023. The last wave of departures is expected in 2024  including those colleagues in Germany who are supporting the dismantling operation in that year. The Brazil capacity enhancement program  which will expand the capabilities of our South America Tubes operations  is on-track.FULL YEAR 2023 OUTLOOKFor the third quarter of the year  based on our assumptions and current market conditions  the Group expects:A decline in Tubes profitability due to lower sales volumes and prices in the US market  slightly offset by higher international pricingprofitability due to lower sales volumes and prices in the US market  slightly offset by higher international pricing Mine and Forest production sold is likely to remain slightly less than the normal cadence with production costs at the high end of the recent rangeThe Group additionally reiterates and supplementsthe Full Year 2023 Outlook provided on July 13  2023:EBITDA is expected to range between €950 million to €1.1 billion .

It corresponds to net cash used in operating activities less restructuring and non-recurring items +/- gross capital expenditure.Adjusted operating cash flow is defined as EBITDA adjusted for non-cash benefits and expenses  financial cash out and tax payments.Asset disposals and other cash items includes cash inflows from asset sales as well as other investing and financing cash flows (e.g. loan reimbursements).Change in working capital refers to the change in the operating working capital requirement.Data at constant exchange rates: The data presented “at constant exchange rates” is calculated by eliminating the translation effect into euros for the revenue of the Group’s entities whose functional currency is not the euro. The translation effect is eliminated by applying Year N-1 exchange rates to Year N revenue of the contemplated entities.EBITDA: Earnings Before Interest  Taxes  Depreciation and Amortization is calculated by taking operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization  and excluding certain operating revenues and expenses that are unusual in nature or occur rarely  such as:impairment of goodwill and non-current assets as determined within the scope of impairment tests carried out in accordance with IAS 36;significant restructuring expenses  particularly resulting from headcount reorganization measures  in respect of major events or decisions;capital gains or losses on disposals;income and expenses resulting from major litigation  significant roll-outs or capital transactions (e.g.  costs of integrating a new activity).Financial cash out includes interest payments on financial and lease debt  interest income and other financial costs.Free cash flow  as previously defined  may continue to be derived as follows: total cash generation - asset disposals & other cash items. This is also defined as EBITDA adjusted for changes in provisions  less interest and tax payments  changes in working capital  less gross capital expenditures  and less restructuring/other cash outflows.Gross capital expenditure: gross capital expenditure is defined as the sum of cash outflows for acquisitions of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets and cash outflows for acquisitions of biological assets.(Increase) decrease in net debt (alternatively  “change in net debt”) is defined as total cash generation +/- non-cash adjustments to net debt.Industrial margin: The industrial margin is defined as the difference between revenue and cost of sales (i.e. after allocation of industrial variable costs and industrial fixed costs)  before depreciation.Lease debt is defined as the present value of unavoidable future lease payments.Net debt: Consolidated net debt (or “net financial debt”) is defined as bank loans and other borrowings plus overdrafts and other short-term borrowings minus cash and cash equivalents. Net debt excludes lease debt.Net working capital requirement is defined as working capital requirement net of provisions for inventories and trade receivables; net working capital requirement days are computed on an annualized quarterly sales basis.Non-cash adjustments to net debt includes non-cash foreign exchange impacts on debt balances  IFRS-defined fair value adjustments on debt balances  and other non-cash items.Non-cash items in EBITDA includes provisions and other non-cash items in EBITDA.Operating working capital requirement includes working capital requirement as well as other receivables and payables.Restructuring charges and non-recurring items consists primarily of the cash costs of executing the New Vallourec plan  including severance costs and other facility closure costs.Total cash generation is defined as adjusted free cash flow +/- restructuring charges and non-recurring items and asset disposals & other cash items. It corresponds to net cash used in operating activities +/- gross capital expenditure and asset disposals & other cash items.Working capital requirement is defined as trade receivables plus inventories minus trade payables (excluding provisions).a As provided on July 13  2023b See market assumptions in “Full Year 2023 Outlook”c $9 million letter of creditand other commitments issued as of June30  2023d Free cash flow aligned with prior definition.

The Board of Directors of Vallourec SA  meeting on July 27th 2023  approved the Group's second quarter 2023 results.Second Quarter 2023 ResultsStrong EBITDA of €3 7 4 million in Q2 driven by both Tubes and Mine & ForestN et d ebt reduced by a further € 13 2 million to € 86 8 m illionFurther increase in Tubes segment profitability due to solid execution in a favorable price environmentMajor investment program in Brazil on-trackConfirm 2023 EBITDA to range between €950 million and €1.1 billionHIGHLIGHTSSolid Q2 2023 PerformanceEBITDA of €3 74 m illion (up €214 million year-over-year) driven by substantial Tubes profitability and a year-over-year (YoY) recovery in Mine volumes Tubes EBITDA of €330 million (up €201 million YoY) supported by a 27% YoY average selling price increase Mine & Forest EBITDA of €50 million (stable YoY): ~0.9 million tonne YoY increase in production sold was offset by lower iron ore selling price(up €214 million year-over-year) driven by substantial Tubes profitability and a year-over-year (YoY) recovery in Mine volumes A dj usted f ree c ash f low of €1 74 million ; free cash flow  as previously defined  was €115 million; free cash flow  as previously defined  was €115 million Net debt reduced by €132 million to €868 millionConfirming Strong FY 2023 OutlookaEBITDA is expected to range between €950 million and €1 .1 b illion bTotal cash generation is expected to be positive in the second half of the year excluding any potential benefit of asset salesis expected to be positive in the second half of the year excluding any potential benefit of asset sales Net debt is expected to decline further vs. the second quarter of 2023Philippe Guillemot  Chairman of the Board of Directors  and Chief Executive Officer  declared:“Our results in Q2 2023 continued the excellent performance we have produced over the last several quarters. Favorable pricing and solid execution across the Group and especially in the Eastern Hemisphere drove robust profitability. In addition  efficient working capital management allowed us to continue to reduce our net debt  which now stands €521 million lower year-over-year. Net debt reduction remains a key focal point for Vallourec.“Our major capability enhancement program is progressing well in Brazil. We expect to drive meaningful improvements in this operation in 2024 as we exit this transformative period.“As we look into the second half of the year  US tubes pricing has been on a downward trend  though it remains at healthy levels. We expect our volumes will trough in the third quarter as distributor inventories normalize  before improving again in the fourth quarter. We expect pricing will stabilize at healthy levels as market headwinds slow in the second half.“Outside of the US  demand for our tubular products remains strong  and pricing has continued to show an upward trend. We are capitalizing on this via our premium production hubs in Brazil and Asia  while continuing to wind down our tube production activities in Germany.“ Our Pau Branco iron ore mine has ramped up activity following the release of the Cachoeirinha waste pile  though we expect it will operate below its full potential in the second half of 2023. We have a plan in place to move our extraction activities towards already identified higher-quality reserves. Permitting is currently underway to execute this plan.“We recently provided an update to our full-year EBITDA objective. We expect to generate €950 million to €1.1 billion of EBITDA in 2023. While EBITDA in the second half of the year is expected to be lower than the first half  the New Vallourec plan is on track. We continue to expect that  compared to 2021  the full €230 million annualized recurring benefit of this plan will be effective in Q2 2024.Finally  we intend to further reduce our net debt in the second half of this year. We reiterate our target to reach zero net debt by year-end 2025 at the latest  a key step in cycle-proofing our business.”Key Datain € million  unless noted Q2 2023 Q1 2023 Q2 2022 QoQ chg. YoY chg.

Tubes EBITDA rose significantly from €129 million in Q2 2022 to €330 million with a 27% increase in the average selling price per tonne more than offsetting the (8%) decrease in volumes.For the first half of 2023  Tubes revenues were up 27% due to higher pricing. Tubes EBITDA more than tripled to reach €609 million based on flattish volumes  coupled with a 27% increase in the average selling price per tonne.Mine & ForestIn Q2 2023  the iron ore mine production sold reached 1.9 million tonnes  compared to 1 million tonnes in Q2 2022. The low result in Q2 2022 was a consequence of the waste pile slippage incident at the beginning of 2022. Consequently  iron ore mine production sold for the first half of 2023 amounted to 3.4 million tonnes.Mine & Forest revenues in Q2 2023 reached €93 million  increasing meaningfully year-on-year (€68 million in Q2 2022). In Q2 2023  Mine & Forest EBITDA reached €50 million  leading to an EBITDA margin of 54%.Mine & Forest revenues for the first half of 2023 reached €186 million  compared to €92 million in H1 2022. For the first half of 2023  Mine & Forest EBITDA reached €98 million  leading to an EBITDA margin of 53%.CASH FLOW AND FINANCIAL POSITIONCash Flow Results AnalysisIn Q2 2023  adjusted operating cash flow improved to €232 million  compared to €73 million in Q2 2022. The significant increase in EBITDA more than offset the higher income tax payments and financial cash out. For the first half of 2023  adjusted operating cash flow significantly increased by €418 million to reach €531 million  mainly driven by higher EBITDA.In Q2 2023  the operating working capital requirement slightly decreased by €8 million  versus an increase of €187 million in Q2 2022. The net working capital requirement stood at 92 days of sales  compared to 117 days in Q2 2022. For the first half of 2023  the operating working capital requirement increased by €44 million  versus a substantial increase of €403 million in H1 2022.Gross capital expenditure was €66 million in Q2 2023 (compared to €25 million in Q2 2022) and amounted to €119 million over the first half of 2023 in comparison with €59 million in H1 2022.For the full year  gross capital expenditure is expected to be around €220 million  including approximately €70 million of capital expenditure related to the transfer of Oil & Gas volumes from Germany to Brazil.In Q2 2023  adjusted free cash flow was positive at €174 million  while it was negative at (€139) million in Q2 2022. For the first half of 2023  adjusted free cash flow stood at €368 million driven by improved EBITDA as well as efficient working capital management (compared to a negative (€349) million in H1 2022).In Q2 2023  total cash generation stood at €118 million  which includes the negative impact of €59 million restructuring charges and other non-recurring items as well as a positive €3 million of asset disposals and other cash items. For the first half of 2023  total cash generation amounted to €269 million  compared to a negative (€430) million in H1 2022.In Q2 2023  free cash flow  as previously defined  was €115 million  compared to (€172) million in Q2 2022  and it was €262 million for the first half of 2023 compared to (€401) million in H1 2022.Net Debt and LiquidityAs of June 30  2023  net debt stood at €868 million  compared to €1.1 billion on December 31  2022. Gross debt amounted to €1.7 billion including €60 million of fair value adjustment under IFRS 9 (which will be reversed over the life of the debt). Long-term debt amounted to €1.4 billion and short-term debt totaled €367 million.As of June 30  2023  lease debt stood at €65 million following the application of IFRS 16 standards  compared to €71 million on December 31  2022.As of June 30  2023  the liquidity position was strong at €1.5 billion  with cash amounting to €855 million  availability on our revolving credit facility (RCF) of €462 million  and availability on an asset-backed loan (ABL) of €181 million (c). The Group has no long-term debt repayments scheduled before June 2026.UPDATE ON THE PAU BRANCO IRON ORE MINEThe Pau Branco mine returned to higher production levels at the end of the second quarter of 2023 following the release of the Cachoeirinha waste pile. Production sold in the second half of 2023 is currently expected to be approximately 3.6 million tonnes  and production costs are expected to remain at the high end of the recent range for the time being. We are currently executing a plan to move our extraction activities to already identified higher-quality reserves over the next few quarters. Vallourec management is currently engaging with state and national regulators to obtain the required production and environmental permits.NEW VALLOUREC PLAN UPDATESThe New Vallourec plan  announced in May 2022  remains fully on track. The plan aims to generate €230 million of recurring EBITDA uplift versus 2021 and an approximately €20 million capex reduction with the full impact starting in Q2 2024. These actions will contribute to making the Group cycle-proof and generating positive free cash flowd  before the change in working capital  even at the bottom of the cycle.The closure of sites in Europe is slightly ahead of schedule  and we expect our German tube production operations will stop in Q4 2023.

Fimalac and Attestor (the “Consortium”)  to strengthen the Casino Group equity capital. Cnova is part of the perimeter of the transaction.On July 28  2023  Casino Group announces that it has  under the aegis of the conciliators and of the Comité Interministériel de restructuration industrielle (CIRI)  entered into an agreement in principle on 27 July 2023 with the Consortium and some of its main creditors aiming at strengthening the Group's equity structure and restructuring its financial debt (the “Agreement in Principle”). The Agreement in Principle confirmed Cnova being part of the perimeter.The semi-annual accounts of Cnova for the period ended on June 30  2023  have been prepared based on the going concern principle. This principle relies on the assessment of liquidity risk at Cnova and Casino group level in light of the cash flow projections for 2023  reviewed by the Accuracy firm  and the need of the successful implementation of the Agreement in Principle. Those cash flow projections also rely among other factors  on the current level of business activity and the existing payment terms with suppliers.In view of the legal steps still to be taken to implement the Agreement in Principle (as specified on page 11 in the Casino group presentation of the Agreement in Principle on restructuring plan8)  the situation as of today is still uncertain as to the Casino group and/or Cnova ability to continue as a going concern and  therefore  Cnova may be unable to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business.Based on the above  as part of their report issued on July 28  2023  Cnova’s Auditors referred as an observation to the business material uncertainty as an area of emphasis and concluded an unqualified opinion on their review of the 2023 half year report and financial statements.Conciliation: information on Casino group and Cnova liquidityAs of June 30  2023  net financial debt reached €582m and net current liabilities are €189m (excluding cash and cash equivalents and current financial debt). As per June 30  2023 Cnova has a negative equity of €442m. The negative equity is mainly caused by the accumulated losses for €605m  the decrease of capital and share exchange between Cnova NV and Cnova Brazil in 2016. For the first six months of 2023  the net loss amounts to €70m and the negative free cash flow before financial expenses to €183m.As per June 30  2023  Cnova had a credit line of €700m with its parent  Casino Guichard-Perrachon set in order to cover the needs of Cnova. As part of the cash pool agreement with Cnova and its subsidiaries  unused credit lines amounted to €253m as of June 30  2023.The term of the cash pool agreement is July 31  2026 and can be terminated by mutual consent.In addition  Casino Guichard-Perrachon confirmed through a letter dated March 28  2023 that it will provide financial support to Cnova N.V. to assist Cnova in meeting its liabilities as and when they fall due up to a maximum of €100m in addition to the abovementioned amount of €700m and only to the extent that funds are not otherwise available to Cnova N.V. to meet such liabilities for a period of at least 18 months from the date of Cnova’s 2022 consolidated financial statement approval  March 30  2023.The cash pool arrangement (Current Account Agreement) immediately terminates if Casino no longer controls  directly or indirectly  Casino Finance or Cnova or its European subsidiaries  as the case may be  or in case of bankruptcy of a party.The sequential degradation of the rating of Casino group by rating agencies implied net financial debt deterioration at Cnova level since April 2023. Working capital of Cnova is significantly impacted due to reductions by credit insurers  implying earlier payments to suppliers and consequently deterioration of net cash flows.On 25 May  2023  a conciliation proceeding for the benefit of the French subsidiaries of Cnova (Cdiscount  Maas  C-Shield  C-Technology  C-Logistics  Carya and CLR) was opened. These conciliation proceedings are part of the more global context of the conciliation proceedings opened for the benefit of the Casino Group.As part of the conciliation proceeding  Casino group received on July 15  2023 a revised offer from EP Global Commerce a.s.  Fimalac and Attestor (the “Consortium”) to strengthen the Casino group’s equity capital. Cnova is part of the perimeter of the transaction.On July 28  2023  Casino Group announces that it has  under the aegis of the conciliators and of the Comité Interministériel de restructuration industrielle (CIRI)  entered into an agreement in principle on 27 July 2023 with the Consortium and some of its main creditors  especially the ones holding more than two-thirds of the Term Loan B  aiming at strengthening the Group's equity structure and restructuring its financial debt (the “Agreement in Principle”). The Agreement in Principle confirmed Cnova being part of the perimeter of the transaction.In view of the legal steps still to be taken to implement the Agreement in Principle (as specified on page 11 in the Casino group presentation of the Agreement in Principle on restructuring plan7)  the situation as of today is still uncertain as to the Casino group and/or Cnova ability to continue as a going concern and  therefore  Cnova may be unable to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business.Also  it should be noted that on June 26  2023  the Casino group communicated on the implementation of various measures to ensure its liquidity throughout the entire conciliation period (lasting until September 25  2023 and extended  if necessary  until October 25  2023 at the latest)  including:Conclusion of an agreement in principle with the French government to defer payment of the Group’s tax and social security liabilities due between May and September 2023  representing an amount of circa €300m; andA standstill request  for the duration of the conciliation proceedings (i.e. until the October 25  2023 at the latest)  of any payment of interests and other fees (i.e. circa €130m) and instalments of principal (i.e. circa €70m). The conciliators sent to the relevant creditors the standstill requests and asked them to waive their right to claim any accelerated payment on the basis of any event of default under the financial covenants as of June 30  2023 and September 30  2023  and more generally  any event of default or cross-default event that may arise as a result of the suspension of the above-mentioned paymentsBased on the items mentioned above and the sale by Casino of its residual stake in Assaí  which was completed on June 23  2023 for net proceeds after costs and taxes estimated at €326m (cf. press release of June 23  2023)  Casino group does not anticipate any liquidity issue until the end of the conciliation period (i.e. until October 25  2023). Assuming the continuation of the standstill in respect of financial charges and debt repayments after the conciliation period  and based on the sale by Casino to Groupement Les Mousquetaires of the first group of sales outlet representing a turnover of €549m excluding VAT (cf. press release dated May 26  2023)  Casino group anticipates that there should be no liquidity issue until the end of the 2023 financial year assuming the level of activity of the brands remain the same in the coming months (notably the recovery of hypermarkets/supermarkets) and on the continuation of suppliers terms of payment (as is currently the case).In the context of the conciliation  Cnova has undertaken various measures to mitigate the cash consumption: (i) the acceleration of its transformation towards a marketplace oriented business model  (ii) the reinforcement of the Efficiency plan launched in 2022 with additional measures in 2023  (iii) an inventory reduction plan to adapt as per new direct sales volumes  and (iv) the request of the standstill of the state guaranteed loan (“PGE”) which was accepted by the bank syndicate as of July 27  2023 for the conciliation period.Up to the date of the authorization by the Board of Directors of these interim financial statements  Cnova has had unrestricted access to the defined financing facilities of the Casino group. In relation to the going concern assessment the continued unrestricted access to these defined financing facilities for the coming year including  if and when required  additional funding under the comfort letter provided by the Casino group  is a significant judgement and will depend on the successful implementation of the Agreement in Principle  as part of the conciliation proceedings.In addition  as part of the going concern assessment  management of Cnova assumes no significant deterioration in performance compared to the business plan and cash forecast (as published on June 26  2023) for the coming twelve months and no significant deterioration compared to current terms of payment for the key suppliers of Cnova.It should be noted that these cash flow forecasts inherently involve significant assumptions and uncertainties at Cnova level  as they depend among other factors  on the level of business activity  the expected payment terms with suppliers in the coming months  the successful implementation of the Agreement in Principle agreed upon on July 27  2023 between Casino group  the Consortium and some of the main creditors aiming at strengthening the Group's equity structure and restructuring its financial debt.The aforementioned events and conditions indicate a material uncertainty exist that may cast notable doubt on Cnova’s ability to continue as a going concern and  therefore  Cnova may be unable to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business.Despite the identified material uncertainty towards Cnova’s going concern assumption  taking into account the assumptions in the cash forecast of Cnova and the positive expected outcome of the conciliation process at the level of Casino Group and Cnova  the Board of Directors considers it appropriate to prepare the interim financial statements on the going concern assumption and do not include any adjustments to the carrying amounts and classification of assets  liabilities and reported expenses that may otherwise be required if the going concern basis was not appropriate.O perational highlightsOperational highlights of the 1st half of 2023 demonstrate the successful shift towards Cnova’s marketplace platform with a GMV share increasing by +8.7pts  dynamic Advertising services revenues increasing by +5% in the 1st semester 2023 and a steady NPS above +50  amongst the best satisfaction rates on the market.Number of orders and items sold decreased by 15% and 19% respectively compared to last year  with a slightly increasing average number of items sold per order  while gross margin as a % of net sales grew by +7pts vs. 22  illustrating the positive impacts of our various actions to improve profitability.Facing challenging market conditions  Cnova overall GMV decreased by -14% like-for-like9 in the 1st semester 2023 confirming Cnova’s strategic choice to accelerate its platform revenues with the development of its marketplace  advertising services and B2B activities with Octopia and C-Logistics. In this context of strong inflation headwinds  Cnova has launched dedicated offers and discounts to take part in the fight against inflation.Furthermore  the 1st semester 2022 benefited from a strong base compared to the 1st semester 2023: 1H22 was before the drop in consumption index which occurred in April and May 2022 and GMV was boosted by a higher 4X payment take rate.Business KPIs 2023Half year 2022Half year10 Changevs. 2022 Marketplace GMV share58.3% 49.6% +8.7pts Marketplace revenues (€m) 91.4 89.7 +1.8% Advertising services revenues (€m) 34.8 33.2 +5% Traffic (million visits) 433.1 494.2 -12% Number of orders (millions) 9.6 11.3 -15% o/w Marketplace orders 7.6 8.0 -5% Items sold (millions) 15.3 18.8 -19% o/w Marketplace items sold 11.6 11.9 -2%2 nd quarter highlightsGMV 2Q23 vs. 22 Total like-for-like5 GMV evolution -13% Net sales like-for-like5 evolution -22% Marketplace GMV evolution -2% Travel GMV growth +3%In the 2nd quarter 2023  Cnova overall GMV decreased by -13% like-for-like11  with positive dynamics compared to the 1st quarter 2023 (+2pts vs. 1Q23).

This gross margin rate increase over the past years demonstrates the success of the implementation of the strategic plan  with Marketplace revenues growing by +2% compared to last year (+28% vs. 19) and Advertising revenues increasing by +5% compared to last year (x2 vs. 19). Compared to 2022  direct sales margin was negatively impacted by an additional destocking initiative focused on SKUs with the most unfavorable inventory turnover to adjust inventories to current level of activity.

Fimalac and Attestor (the “Consortium”)  to strengthen the Casino Group equity capital. Cnova is part of the perimeter of the transaction.On July 28  2023  Casino Group announces that it has  under the aegis of the conciliators and of the Comité Interministériel de restructuration industrielle (CIRI)  entered into an agreement in principle on 27 July 2023 with the Consortium and some of its main creditors aiming at strengthening the Group's equity structure and restructuring its financial debt (the “Agreement in Principle”). The Agreement in Principle confirmed Cnova being part of the perimeter.The semi-annual accounts of Cnova for the period ended on June 30  2023  have been prepared based on the going concern principle. This principle relies on the assessment of liquidity risk at Cnova and Casino group level in light of the cash flow projections for 2023  reviewed by the Accuracy firm  and the need of the successful implementation of the Agreement in Principle. Those cash flow projections also rely among other factors  on the current level of business activity and the existing payment terms with suppliers.In view of the legal steps still to be taken to implement the Agreement in Principle (as specified on page 11 in the Casino group presentation of the Agreement in Principle on restructuring plan8)  the situation as of today is still uncertain as to the Casino group and/or Cnova ability to continue as a going concern and  therefore  Cnova may be unable to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business.Based on the above  as part of their report issued on July 28  2023  Cnova’s Auditors referred as an observation to the business material uncertainty as an area of emphasis and concluded an unqualified opinion on their review of the 2023 half year report and financial statements.Conciliation: information on Casino group and Cnova liquidityAs of June 30  2023  net financial debt reached €582m and net current liabilities are €189m (excluding cash and cash equivalents and current financial debt). As per June 30  2023 Cnova has a negative equity of €442m. The negative equity is mainly caused by the accumulated losses for €605m  the decrease of capital and share exchange between Cnova NV and Cnova Brazil in 2016. For the first six months of 2023  the net loss amounts to €70m and the negative free cash flow before financial expenses to €183m.As per June 30  2023  Cnova had a credit line of €700m with its parent  Casino Guichard-Perrachon set in order to cover the needs of Cnova. As part of the cash pool agreement with Cnova and its subsidiaries  unused credit lines amounted to €253m as of June 30  2023.The term of the cash pool agreement is July 31  2026 and can be terminated by mutual consent.In addition  Casino Guichard-Perrachon confirmed through a letter dated March 28  2023 that it will provide financial support to Cnova N.V. to assist Cnova in meeting its liabilities as and when they fall due up to a maximum of €100m in addition to the abovementioned amount of €700m and only to the extent that funds are not otherwise available to Cnova N.V. to meet such liabilities for a period of at least 18 months from the date of Cnova’s 2022 consolidated financial statement approval  March 30  2023.The cash pool arrangement (Current Account Agreement) immediately terminates if Casino no longer controls  directly or indirectly  Casino Finance or Cnova or its European subsidiaries  as the case may be  or in case of bankruptcy of a party.The sequential degradation of the rating of Casino group by rating agencies implied net financial debt deterioration at Cnova level since April 2023. Working capital of Cnova is significantly impacted due to reductions by credit insurers  implying earlier payments to suppliers and consequently deterioration of net cash flows.On 25 May  2023  a conciliation proceeding for the benefit of the French subsidiaries of Cnova (Cdiscount  Maas  C-Shield  C-Technology  C-Logistics  Carya and CLR) was opened. These conciliation proceedings are part of the more global context of the conciliation proceedings opened for the benefit of the Casino Group.As part of the conciliation proceeding  Casino group received on July 15  2023 a revised offer from EP Global Commerce a.s.  Fimalac and Attestor (the “Consortium”) to strengthen the Casino group’s equity capital. Cnova is part of the perimeter of the transaction.On July 28  2023  Casino Group announces that it has  under the aegis of the conciliators and of the Comité Interministériel de restructuration industrielle (CIRI)  entered into an agreement in principle on 27 July 2023 with the Consortium and some of its main creditors  especially the ones holding more than two-thirds of the Term Loan B  aiming at strengthening the Group's equity structure and restructuring its financial debt (the “Agreement in Principle”). The Agreement in Principle confirmed Cnova being part of the perimeter of the transaction.In view of the legal steps still to be taken to implement the Agreement in Principle (as specified on page 11 in the Casino group presentation of the Agreement in Principle on restructuring plan7)  the situation as of today is still uncertain as to the Casino group and/or Cnova ability to continue as a going concern and  therefore  Cnova may be unable to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business.Also  it should be noted that on June 26  2023  the Casino group communicated on the implementation of various measures to ensure its liquidity throughout the entire conciliation period (lasting until September 25  2023 and extended  if necessary  until October 25  2023 at the latest)  including:Conclusion of an agreement in principle with the French government to defer payment of the Group’s tax and social security liabilities due between May and September 2023  representing an amount of circa €300m; andA standstill request  for the duration of the conciliation proceedings (i.e. until the October 25  2023 at the latest)  of any payment of interests and other fees (i.e. circa €130m) and instalments of principal (i.e. circa €70m). The conciliators sent to the relevant creditors the standstill requests and asked them to waive their right to claim any accelerated payment on the basis of any event of default under the financial covenants as of June 30  2023 and September 30  2023  and more generally  any event of default or cross-default event that may arise as a result of the suspension of the above-mentioned paymentsBased on the items mentioned above and the sale by Casino of its residual stake in Assaí  which was completed on June 23  2023 for net proceeds after costs and taxes estimated at €326m (cf. press release of June 23  2023)  Casino group does not anticipate any liquidity issue until the end of the conciliation period (i.e. until October 25  2023). Assuming the continuation of the standstill in respect of financial charges and debt repayments after the conciliation period  and based on the sale by Casino to Groupement Les Mousquetaires of the first group of sales outlet representing a turnover of €549m excluding VAT (cf. press release dated May 26  2023)  Casino group anticipates that there should be no liquidity issue until the end of the 2023 financial year assuming the level of activity of the brands remain the same in the coming months (notably the recovery of hypermarkets/supermarkets) and on the continuation of suppliers terms of payment (as is currently the case).In the context of the conciliation  Cnova has undertaken various measures to mitigate the cash consumption: (i) the acceleration of its transformation towards a marketplace oriented business model  (ii) the reinforcement of the Efficiency plan launched in 2022 with additional measures in 2023  (iii) an inventory reduction plan to adapt as per new direct sales volumes  and (iv) the request of the standstill of the state guaranteed loan (“PGE”) which was accepted by the bank syndicate as of July 27  2023 for the conciliation period.Up to the date of the authorization by the Board of Directors of these interim financial statements  Cnova has had unrestricted access to the defined financing facilities of the Casino group. In relation to the going concern assessment the continued unrestricted access to these defined financing facilities for the coming year including  if and when required  additional funding under the comfort letter provided by the Casino group  is a significant judgement and will depend on the successful implementation of the Agreement in Principle  as part of the conciliation proceedings.In addition  as part of the going concern assessment  management of Cnova assumes no significant deterioration in performance compared to the business plan and cash forecast (as published on June 26  2023) for the coming twelve months and no significant deterioration compared to current terms of payment for the key suppliers of Cnova.It should be noted that these cash flow forecasts inherently involve significant assumptions and uncertainties at Cnova level  as they depend among other factors  on the level of business activity  the expected payment terms with suppliers in the coming months  the successful implementation of the Agreement in Principle agreed upon on July 27  2023 between Casino group  the Consortium and some of the main creditors aiming at strengthening the Group's equity structure and restructuring its financial debt.The aforementioned events and conditions indicate a material uncertainty exist that may cast notable doubt on Cnova’s ability to continue as a going concern and  therefore  Cnova may be unable to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business.Despite the identified material uncertainty towards Cnova’s going concern assumption  taking into account the assumptions in the cash forecast of Cnova and the positive expected outcome of the conciliation process at the level of Casino Group and Cnova  the Board of Directors considers it appropriate to prepare the interim financial statements on the going concern assumption and do not include any adjustments to the carrying amounts and classification of assets  liabilities and reported expenses that may otherwise be required if the going concern basis was not appropriate.O perational highlightsOperational highlights of the 1st half of 2023 demonstrate the successful shift towards Cnova’s marketplace platform with a GMV share increasing by +8.7pts  dynamic Advertising services revenues increasing by +5% in the 1st semester 2023 and a steady NPS above +50  amongst the best satisfaction rates on the market.Number of orders and items sold decreased by 15% and 19% respectively compared to last year  with a slightly increasing average number of items sold per order  while gross margin as a % of net sales grew by +7pts vs. 22  illustrating the positive impacts of our various actions to improve profitability.Facing challenging market conditions  Cnova overall GMV decreased by -14% like-for-like9 in the 1st semester 2023 confirming Cnova’s strategic choice to accelerate its platform revenues with the development of its marketplace  advertising services and B2B activities with Octopia and C-Logistics. In this context of strong inflation headwinds  Cnova has launched dedicated offers and discounts to take part in the fight against inflation.Furthermore  the 1st semester 2022 benefited from a strong base compared to the 1st semester 2023: 1H22 was before the drop in consumption index which occurred in April and May 2022 and GMV was boosted by a higher 4X payment take rate.Business KPIs 2023Half year 2022Half year10 Changevs. 2022 Marketplace GMV share58.3% 49.6% +8.7pts Marketplace revenues (€m) 91.4 89.7 +1.8% Advertising services revenues (€m) 34.8 33.2 +5% Traffic (million visits) 433.1 494.2 -12% Number of orders (millions) 9.6 11.3 -15% o/w Marketplace orders 7.6 8.0 -5% Items sold (millions) 15.3 18.8 -19% o/w Marketplace items sold 11.6 11.9 -2%2 nd quarter highlightsGMV 2Q23 vs. 22 Total like-for-like5 GMV evolution -13% Net sales like-for-like5 evolution -22% Marketplace GMV evolution -2% Travel GMV growth +3%In the 2nd quarter 2023  Cnova overall GMV decreased by -13% like-for-like11  with positive dynamics compared to the 1st quarter 2023 (+2pts vs. 1Q23).

28538,EuroNext,Bing API,https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2023/07/29/annual-reports-are-fast-becoming-political-treatises/,Annual reports are fast becoming political treatises,In its annual report  Stéphane Boujnah  the European exchange’s chair and chief executive officer  stresses that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine “has demonstrated very clearly the need for reinforced European co-operation and a strengthened European Union”.,What are the chances that a European company could describe the operating environment of the past year without mentioning the words “Russia”  “Ukraine” or “war”?You might think it would be impossible. But you would be wrong.Swiss insurer Helvetia has managed to do just that in its 2022 annual report  despite the invasion of Ukraine triggering roaring inflation  an energy crisis and disruption to supplies of everything from grain to fertiliser to metals.Even if Helvetia mentioned the war as a post-balance sheet event in its 2021 accounts  with a fleeting reference in 2022′s first-half results  failing to bring up the conflict in last year’s annual report seems like a glaring omission.READ MOREThe company’s take on 2022 is just one of several unexpected approaches used by European companies in their most recent annual reports. In stark contrast to Helvetia is Swedish online bank Avanza. In his letter to shareholders  Avanza’s chair and founder  Sven Hagströmer  urges Ukrainians and the west to “break the back of the Russian bear”  and describes the invading country as an “evil and unreliable power”.A niche Swedish bank run by an outspoken entrepreneur could be an outlier. Except that even Euronext  Europe’s biggest stock exchange group  has decided now is not the time for the usual corporate diplomacy when it comes to the region’s politics.In its annual report  Stéphane Boujnah  the European exchange’s chair and chief executive officer  stresses that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine “has demonstrated very clearly the need for reinforced European co-operation and a strengthened European Union”.German metals group Aurubis warns that Russia is “weaponising” energy  while Swedish property developer Fabege says that the war has “blurred the line between reality and fiction in an unreal and frightening way”.The emotional intensity of many of this year’s reports is understandable given the recent extraordinary events. But it raises the question of whether these documents are evolving as companies feel increasingly compelled to take political positions.Annual reports are not just financial summaries. They are “strategic” documents  carefully drafted to address a company’s perceived accountability to stakeholders  says Hendrik Vollmer  associate professor of accounting at Warwick Business School. In the past  companies tried to avoid appearing biased  he tells me. But as the definition of accountability has been extended – to environmental commitments  for example – “there has been something of a dam break”.Being accountable means taking a clear position on what needs to be done  according to Hagströmer. “Companies should be more outspoken politically. They are part of society ” he says.That view has become more common over the past decade as companies embrace corporate social responsibility. “If you go back to the 1980s or 90s  when companies talked about corporate social responsibility (CSR) they would donate money to build a stadium or support a sports team ” says Kaisa Snellman  associate professor of organisational behaviour at Insead business school. “Now CSR means that ... as a CEO  you are going to speak up. Sometimes it will offend your customers ...[or] your employees. And sometimes ... your investors.”In some respects  that may not be a bad thing. A recent study found that companies that came in highest or lowest on a well-known ranking of LGBTQ policies were rewarded by investors with share-price rises  while those in the middle were ignored. It was not about who had the most inclusive policies  but who had the clearest positions.“Not taking a position will make both sides hate you ” says London Business School assistant professor Aharon Cohen-Mohliver  co-author of the study. “People have to believe you are sincere and for that you have to bear some cost by using language that is very strong and clear.”There are obvious risks in taking public positions on these issues  as companies such as Disney have discovered. Yet Mohliver believes more companies will be willing to do so in future in order to differentiate themselves from rivals. “The more you see companies take a position on one side  the more the market opportunity increases for taking a position on the other side ” he says.[ Work Company culture is more important than money to many job seekers ]Meanwhile  Avanza’s Hagströmer has no intention of holding back. “What is going on in the world really affects markets ” he says. “If everybody is affected  why should it not be in annual reports? It’s the elephant in the room.” – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2023,neutral,0.09,0.58,0.32,negative,0.02,0.25,0.74,True,English,"['Annual reports', 'political treatises', 'London Business School assistant professor', 'Swedish property developer Fabege', 'biggest stock exchange group', 'Swedish online bank Avanza', 'Warwick Business School', 'Insead business school', 'post-balance sheet event', '2022′s first-half results', 'several unexpected approaches', 'usual corporate diplomacy', 'Stéphane Boujnah', 'chief executive officer', 'corporate social responsibility', 'many job seekers', 'recent extraordinary events', 'German metals group', 'The Financial Times', 'Work Company culture', 'Sven Hagströmer', 'Swiss insurer Helvetia', 'recent annual reports', 'Swedish bank', 'European exchange', 'associate professor', 'financial summaries', '2022 annual report', 'recent study', 'operating environment', 'roaring inflation', 'energy crisis', 'fleeting reference', 'glaring omission', 'stark contrast', 'Russian bear', 'invading country', 'unreliable power', 'outspoken entrepreneur', 'European co-operation', 'European Union', 'frightening way', 'emotional intensity', 'political positions', 'Hendrik Vollmer', 'environmental commitments', 'dam break', 'sports team', 'Kaisa Snellman', 'organisational behaviour', 'bad thing', 'known ranking', 'LGBTQ policies', 'share-price rises', 'inclusive policies', 'clearest positions', 'Aharon Cohen-Mohliver', 'obvious risks', 'public positions', 'one side', 'market opportunity', 'other side', 'European company', 'last year', 'past decade', 'strategic” documents', 'Now CSR', 'past year', 'clear position', 'European companies', 'chances', 'words', 'Ukraine', 'invasion', 'disruption', 'supplies', 'everything', 'grain', 'fertiliser', '2021 accounts', 'conflict', 'READ', 'letter', 'shareholders', 'chair', 'founder', 'Ukrainians', 'west', 'back', 'evil', 'outlier', 'Euronext', 'region', 'politics', 'need', 'Aurubis', 'reality', 'fiction', 'unreal', 'question', 'accountability', 'stakeholders', 'accounting', 'definition', 'example', 'something', 'part', 'society', 'view', '1980s', '90s', 'money', 'stadium', 'CEO', 'customers', 'employees', 'investors', 'respects', 'middle', 'sides', 'author', 'People', 'cost', 'language', 'issues', 'Disney', 'future', 'order', 'rivals', 'intention', 'world', 'markets', 'everybody', 'elephant', 'room', 'Copyright']",2023-07-29,2023-07-29,irishtimes.com
